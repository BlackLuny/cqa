AA10353286	I'm the cynic, sorry. And also the realist when it comes to this type of thing. He doesn't know, and none of us do. We just assume based on past experience with a person that we will want to buy into a lifelong commitment with someone because that's what we've been raised to believe we're "supposed" to do.<br>  <br>  We are usually wrong though. 50% of married people get divorced, and half of the 50% who actually stay married are miserable, cheating, pill popping, sometimes child molesting,etc. I mean seriously. It aint a fairy tale. Things are not what they seem, even if people try to convince you that they are. Not to say that there aren't TRULY happily married people, there are. Who are these people? Who knows. Apparently they stay in front of the computer on Y!A, but don't interact in real life. <br>  <br>  Just because people stay married doesn't mean anything. One of my family members met there spouse when they were toddlers. Dated through elementary/high school/and college. They married, and are still married 40 years later. One of them is a child molester, including of his own children who are now grown. I know of two situations like this. Seriously, people need to get their heads out of the clouds.<br>  <br>  Take your time in life before you sign some lifelong contract with someone. Really take your time. Like, lots and lots of time. Live your life. Enjoy yourself. Get to know yourself(like, beyond the age of 30). Isn't 30 the new 20? Then 30 is too young to get married imo. You will get tired of the person, and if you don't get tired of them, they will get tired of you. <br>  <br>  I have been married six years. With my husband for almost double that, and we have stopped living the fantasy(except in the bedroom). Our relationship is about reality. We are completely honest with each other(at least that's what we agreed). We don't make promises to each other we can't keep. No promises of never wanting to be with anyone ever again in our entire lives. It sounds romantic, but it's usually a lie. We take one day at a time, and we are happy that way. Who knows what the future holds? I don't.|`|GnvfguGoaa	No, you don't get tired of the same person everyday.  But the key is that you can still be yourself and the same with your partner.  If a man can look at a woman, imagine growing old together, and wants to work everyday to make her happy....then he is ready.  It takes work on both sides, and the couple has to know that they are in for all the ups and downs.|`|N83W7chvaa	Some men like myself want that commitment. And when we have found the one we just know naturally. In my case I found the one and it doesn't even come to mind of getting tired of the same person the rest of me life. I find it a great honor being married to the same women the rest of my life.|`|XvBPAFqOaa	Men are easier then you think. TRUST me! We Look for someone who is going to take care of us in more ways then sexually. Sex is HUGE with guys and if you just stop doing it or caring about it then we will find the ones who do. So, take care of him all the time, support his sports teams and hobbies and let him be himself as long as you are excepting him for himself. When we have the full package and do find that one who can balance all of this then I have given my wife the world in more ways then one.|`|AA11220327	My husband told me that he knew i was "the one" when because of a scheduling mix up, i was ok with his then 1 year old daughter joining us on our 1st date (it was a daytime lunch date) and when I would help him with something (carrying things when he pushed the stroller, holding the door for the stroller, etc) without him ever asking me i just helped him. And he had never been with anyone who acted like that before. That 1st date was 2 years ago, and we have never gotten tired of each other for a second, in fact we get closer all the time.

Ask him could you guys have the convo about getting 2gether again and just start over...My boyfriend and I were really close before we got 2gether. That was 9 months ago. Its better to get to know each other very well before you jump into a relationship..It will work out 4 u guys|`|EMYlCPfuaa	why dont you just carry on your friendship and see what happens? the more you get to know each other the better and more confident you will feel and so will he. just let the relationshop blossom at its own pace. forcing never got anyone anywhere and that is the one thing that does wreck relaionships and make them stale. when you let it go at its own pace, then everything falls into place because you are both more comfortable. give it a go. you may surprise yourself and have a great time building a firm lasting relationship that holds all the great relationshops keys! trust, respect, love, faithfulness, loyalty adn most of all you will know your compatibilities... :0)|`|WLKLk6xaaa	Tell him the way you feel even the but i think im scared that once im in a relationship, ill want out of it and i dont want to hurt him. part at least that way he will know your true feelings and that u might be afraid of commitment <br>  hope it all works out|`|jIY08Qmqaa	try it with him and if it doesn't work out ask hi if he feels the same, but make sure you end on good terms and ask to still be friends, i would think this would work :)|`|ljiIgYFoaa	never know unless you try|`|AUa4m0Qgaa	wow, this is a tuff one. ok so i would tell him that i have feelings for him now and that im just not so sure bout bein in a relationship.. it would be hard to tell him that i know but maybe he will understand. just try ur best on lettin him know how u feel and that the relationship is not really for u right now.|`|B3oozIGyaa	If you feel that you get along really well and you like him more then a friend now then just go for it :) ... going into a relationship might make you alot closer :)<br>  <br>  If you dont know if thats still what he wants.. do abit of flirting with him, be abit more playful ! lol .. see how he reacts :)<br>  <br>  do what you feel you want, take a chance if you have it :)<br>  <br>  good luck :) x|`|y499zJUzaa	i would personally tell him how u feell, the truth. just tell him 'hey look u know how u asked me out and i said no' so on.... but you shouldnt be afraid ta be in a relationship,take chancess. i mean u never know,it might work out really good.|`|bet4Cugjaa	I personally would see if he still wanted to go out, and if yes, and just take it from there. You'll never know unless you try it hun.
CrsK0p1Yaa	LOL @ alphabet. I think you do need to confront the liar and tell him that u caught him in  LIE. How are u to trust him if he cnat even be trusted to tell u the truth? tha is pathetically sad. Either get new friends who wont lie to you or confront him and demand an answer!|`|oBHfK5sQaa	I think you should ask him first.I mean ask why he lied to you.didn't he want to chat with you any more?if yes why lying?does he think that lying is the way  to escape your other questions?<br>  then you must decide whether you went hard on him that made him treat you this way or this time it was his fault.|`|y499zJUzaa	ughh maybe theres a misunderstanding. why end a friendship over something so small. dont let those little things get to you. thats what makes things worser.|`|lVIdENvqaa	Tell him how you feel about him lying and see if he can squirm his way out of that one.<br>  He was probably trying not to hurt you.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Don't be upset. It's just his way of ending the conversation. It's a little weird how concerned you are about it.|`|ON84EQaBaa	Do you think that maybe he didn't want to talk to you any longer and just used going to bed as an excuse to hang up. if you let little things like this upset you whats going to happen in other situations? do you think he did go to bed & got back up. Life is to short to get upset or mad about things like this, I bet before you read answers it will be alright.|`|CqoTqEu6aa	wow calm down . . . <br>  unless your a totally nuts hills-wanna bee you have no reason to get upset over that!<br>  <br>  What if he couldn't sleep and decided to go back on the computer? and is it really any of your business what he does? i mean seriously so what if he was done talking to you he was just letting you down gently that is really nothing to get mad about, how did you imagine the conversation going in your head. <br>  <br>  "You said you were signing off IM, but then i went on later to check and you were on again? why did you lie to me? are you avoiding me? do you not like me or something?"<br>  <br>  . . . .humm yeah you for sure wouldn't come off looking crazy . . .|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	It'd be kind of awkward to bring it up now to him, wouldn't it?  I would have gone visible on the other IM and sent him a "hey, thought you were going to sleep" -- but since you kept quiet, I don't know what to tell you.<br>  Is this just a friend, or someone you think of more than a friend?  If it's just a friend, maybe he was saying bye to you so he could chat with someone he's interested in more than friends, you know?  An uninterrupted convo with someone.  IM gets sticky.  Plus sometimes you hear the excuse -- "I was signed on but I wasn't at my computer, I left it on I guess."  You never really know, and end up having to take their word for it -- no matter what anyway.  <br>  I wouldn't be too hurt about it in the end, not if you're only friends.  There's worse he could do, right?|`|NTUr0t3haa	(1) He might have intended to go to bed but got distracted.<br>  <br>  (2) He might have said it as a polite way to end the convo.<br>  <br>  I doubt that he was purposely trying to deceive you with malicious intent.|`|J6ZoyB9iaa	dont trip potato chip.<br>  <br>  how do you know that he just didnt sign off of the user?<br>  <br>  don't jump to conclusions.<br>  <br>  if it's really bothering you then confront him on it.

5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	A friend of mine had her bachelorette party almost a month before the wedding.  We had a big van, went out to dinner, and then hit all the area bars.<br>  <br>  Her and her fiance also had a joint bachelor/bachelorette party a week before the big day.  They had a bonfire with grilled out food, beer, and a live band.<br>  <br>  I like this idea a lot better then a drunken binge the night before the wedding.  I also think it'd be hard to do it a few days before as most people would have to work in the morning and wouldn't want to be partying too hard or be out too late.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My fiance and I will be having seperate parties, but I haven't thought much about mine yet. My fiance is going paintballing during the day and bar hopping at night; I think they are going to a strip club as well. I don't really know what I will do, I am not that concerned and figure my bridesmaids can plan it if they want lol...<br>  <br>  For my best friend's bachelorette party we had pizza at her house and then went to see Cirque du Soleil at a local venue. It was awesome! We are not big drinkers and we had 3 pregnant bridesmaids at the time so bars were not in the plans for us. Instead, we surprised the bride by taking her to see a show she'd been talking about for years - and she loved it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|di6p10Ifaa	I have no idea what my girlfriends have in store for me but I made it clear that my fiance and I have come to the agreement of no strippers, that is just not us. I think he is going to go out and shoot pool and hang out with the guys, we might meet up later that evening. I like the idea of the bachelor party together!|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Well my bachelor party wont be for about a year but I talk to my friend who is going to plan it and we plan on drinking lots of Stoli and playing online games.  No strippers, but lots of fun and guy time.  :)  I wouldnt recommend the night before the wedding as you do not want him to come with a hangover.  3 nights like you agreed on would be good though.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	My fiance & I are a-ok no matter what gets planned. And we don't care if the other person is taken to a strip club either.<br>  <br>  Our parties will be separate.  I don't know yet what the best man is planning, but my MOH is organizing the girls to participate in a scavenger hunt in New York City then we will all go out to dinner (hopefully in Chinatown where I have a favorite restaurant!!)|`|ownoc1ZJaa	Nope, we didn't.  Neither of us wanted one.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I am having a double bachelorette party with my MOH who is getting married a month after me. We are renting a limo and going to Mohegan Sun (it's a casino with dance clubs). Neither me nor my fiance are going to have strippers. We don't agree with that sort of thing for us. We are doing it a couple weeks before the wedding.
sUH902cDaa	I think it's all down to jealousy and insecurity, every girl feels the need to bring others down so she looks better, many girls just cant be proud of others and have to gossip about them. Sometimes i think it would be better to be a guy lol!!!|`|OhNviPquaa	Girls are like this because they can be. Have you ever noticed that most shows and movies geared towards teenage girls involves people that should by no means be liked by the way they act, and yet are so popular? Plus the hormone thing. Keep a hold on your guy friends, cause nice girls like us need them to stay sane in girl-world :P|`|FuCObhWkaa	It is human nature,instinct and hormones,we all want the best hottest cutest sweetest guy and as a woman or teen when you don't get this you feel angered so we become aggressive it really is just an instinct.|`|CqoTqEu6aa	i agree it can be hard to keep girlfriends . . . though it can be hard to keep some guy friends to. The only girls i have ever managed to keep as friends for longer then like a year were the laid back kinda girls that ignore drama instead of seeking it out. I don't really think it has so much to do with "jealousy" as it does boredom. Girls want there lives to be soap opera drama so there always has to be some other girl to play the bad guy. In my experience too many girls are way to eager to find a reason to turn you into the villain, all they need is for you to do some little thing that makes them upset and suddenly your "that *****". Just look for laid back friends who are allergic to drama and you can find some really great girl friends.|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	None of my close fiends are girls. I think it's some kind of competitiveness or something. I don't act typical girlish so I just guess they don't hang around? I did once have a very good friend that was a girl, she burned me bigtime! Anyhow I don't have time in my life for people who are going to be that way.
ZDqdYhdGaa	I had a friend just like this when I was younger, sadly she never changed. It sounds like she doesn't respect you at all and only cares about herself. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would keep her as a casual friend, but I would ditch her as your best friend. Friends aren't supposed to treat people like that, and the ones that do have a lot of growing up to do and I don't think that you will be able to change her much. I would stop driving her around and tell her that you don't want to waste the gas or the miles on the car and if she has stuff to do then she can drive. I would never trust her in the type of situation where you were left at a party. My old gf did that twice! And I finally realized that life was happier without her and that she wasn't a true friend. <br>  <br>  If you want to hold onto the friendship than you just need to stand up to her. Don't let people walk all over you, you deserve better! As for the project in school, assign her certain parts and put your foot down! She does this, and you do that, period. If she starts to slack off, tell her "I'm not doing your work for you so unless you want us both to fail you need to get it done".<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you realize you deserve to be treated better.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	call her out in front of every body.|`|31dYYp9Oaa	this is very simple, it might not be what you want to hear but shes not your friend. its easy to see shes using you for her own little benifits. She's making you run around doing all her messages, and then being horrible to you. for all you know she says she tells people your her friend but says the opposite. She obviously needs you, so put your foot down, even if she takes a tantrum, she needs you. so... use that to your advantage. say no at some things i'm not saying tell her to leave you because you obviously want to be her friend if you've stayed with her this long.<br>  <br>  I think thats what you should do, good luck!|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Consider this as practice ....You will run into this self-centered, non-caring user-type for the rest of your life.<br>    Just the fact that she left you vulnerable in the bathroom speaks volumes....She is not a friend. Tell her you are FED-UP with her behavior towards you.<br>     Do the project yourself. STOP driving her around. She is not making you do anything. You are letting it happen to you.<br>     Would you let her treat  your baby sister like this? NO. So treat yourself to some Real friends and unload this B%#*|`|asp4DaiHaa	wow why your still friends is beyond me. <br>  just tell her you don't like her attitude, and if she dose not pull her own weight on the project then when it comes time to turn it in, only have your name on it. or tell your professor. <br>  and as for standing up for yourself, just keep thinking " i'm better than this..i deserve more" and before long your conifence will grow. then you wont let yourself get pushed around by her<br>  good luck and god bless
XGp3oF5baa	You are supposed to send out invitations 2 months in advance if you are sending response cards. Give them a month to respond and then start calling. That will give you 11 days to call everyone and get an exact head count. The idea is to not send them out to early that they forget about them but not to send them out to late where they don't have time to plan transportation, hotels, etc. Also so they won't schedule anything else on that day. Hope it helps. I just got married in September of 2008 so congratulations and the best of luck to you both! Marriage is AWESOME!!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Two to three months would be a good time frame... Especially if you have out of towners...<br>  <br>  And I would definitely call them before May 31st if you haven't received an RSVP back from some guests...  Just tell them you are finalizing the guest list and wondering if So and So is attending your wedding.  :)|`|8fT10Lvbaa	4 or 6 weeks.....|`|jH5IVIahaa	Congrats! I'm getting married that day, too. I've already sent my invitations out, but most of the grooms family was out of towners. I asked my guests to RSVP by May 20th, but my wedding planner said I should have said May 10th. The sooner you have a final head count, the better. Once we realized that we should have asked for the RSVP's sooner, we decided that we will call the people who haven't responded in mid May. You need your final head count so you can get a solid idea of costs, right? I'd send our your invitations as soon as possible.|`|eSkNDqLKaa	I would send them out May 2 - 9th, 4 to 5 weeks prior to your RSVP date.  You don't want to send them out too early, because some people shelve it and then forget about it.  There is nothing wrong with calling guests that did not respond in time!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would send them out at least 2 months in advance.

oB1TH9Auaa	Cutting ties with your parents is your choice - you can simply no longer contact them, not take calls from them, etc.<br>  <br>  However, you might think about staying in contact by sending cards on holidays, birthdays, etc.  If you are an only child you will have to deal with them at some point, probably after a major incident.  <br>  <br>  Believe me, I know how you feel - on the dad side at least.  I recommend that you sit down and tell them exactly how you feel and why you are going to only stay in touch by the postal service.  That way they understand and don't try to call/visit you.  By staying in touch by mail - if something should happen then the authorities can find you.|`|AA10461680	dont cut ties with them<br>  <br>  you will regret it forever|`|vg7bq0DNaa	emancipate yourself from them.

AA10065812	He needs ti file right away, along with an injunction stopping her from taking the child from the state.  If she gets to California, all she has to do is make a false allegation against him and California controls the case.<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|FsmcCXlvaa	He needs to talk to a lawyer asap. The laws may differ from state to state and he needs to know what his rights are. She shouldn't be able to move the child without his consent but he may have to file paperwork before it happens. Since he doesn't know the details of the laws he must find out now. Once she moves he may have fewer rights and it could get ugly. If joint custody is awarded there would be guidelines for where they'd live. I wouldn't want a court to decide that for me so he needs to make his move now!

Try to find a balance between the things you used to do back in New York, like shopping, and the things girls do here, like sleepovers. <br>  <br>  It sucks, but you don't want to live in misery, right? Change is hard, but I'm sure you're the kind of girl who can learn to let go of some old habits and make herself happy anywhere. Having good friends is the most important thing in the world.

I think you need to go and get some classes or therapy before you and her reconcile!|`|6VhcygKsaa	First of all there it is not an accident that you hurt her.  You should never lay your hands on a woman.. And being pregnant just makes it worse.  I think you might need to get counsling for your anger.  What if the next time it is worse?  How would you feel then...  You need to get counsling...  You should always walk away when your so angry that you even think your going to hit a woman..  Or vise a versa!!!  Nothing is worth hurting the one that you love or that is carrying your child....  Violence is not the answer...|`|Rfj7m8LZaa	how can you accidentally beat your girlfriend? you need to learn to control your anger, no matter how mad she makes you there is no reason to hit her. i don't blame her for not talking to you and not wanting to have anything to do with you.

There is no accidental beating, especially if she's pregnant! Women may have issues with each other, but the second we find out one of us is being abused, most of us stand strong and stand together. Don't even try to play "victim" here! I'm telling you right now, it won't work. We're not stupid. Your girlfriend isn't either. I hope she realizes her strength and leaves you. You don't deserve her. If she does stay with you, it's not out of respect. It's either due to low confidence levels or fear of being a single mom. You need to get serious help.|`|srjaX8A8aa	you can't "beat you girlfriend on accident" thats a bunch of bullshit.<br>  <br>  if she's stupid like rihanna, maybe she'll come back to you, but if she's even somewhat intelligent she'll leave your ***. i would apologize to her, and then just stay away. if she does take you back, treat her like a f*cking queen.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	if u r serious u should be in  jail

Because being pregnant can cause mood swings. Are you sure you haven't been a cruel mean ***** to him during your pregnancy?|`|PEWKoIOvaa	don't listen to leanna. seduction is a lie. manipulation. dishonesty. forcing a person, through false misrepresentation, to do something they otherwise wouldn't want to do. so what leanna is doing is not being loved, but keeping a trophy in her case that happens to f--k every once in a while. there is nothing that can take the place of sincere, undisguised desire of one person for another: the desire to give your all and your best to the one person whom you care for more than any other in the world. anything short of that is a lie. do you want to live a lie? you may think you get what you want, but you're not. you're getting a pet who obeys you, not a man who loves you with his heart because he wants to. having said that, take it easy. don't panic. maybe he just got scared. maybe he'll come around. and if he doesn't, accept that and let it go. if he's too cowardly to stay by your side when it's a question of duty and responsibility, do you want that kind of a partner to share a 'life" with anyway? concentrate on loving your child and letting it feel that energy from you as it grows inside you and then on giving it the best and most loving world you can give it. and in the meantime, look for another man - trust me, there are plenty of men who aren't cowardly, selfish brutes and who actually take love and responsibility and partnership seriously. but our popular culture brainwashes us into believing that love and partnership is far inferior to being a selfish, lying, manipulating, self-absorbed s.l.u.t (man or woman).|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	We are not insensitive,but we don't let our heart override common sense.Not sure what your particular situation is,but if it's true what you say he is wrong.Actually he is wrong anyway for leaving you when you could use some help and support.That is unless the baby isn't his..|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	Your husband left you and your pregnant, and all you can say is that he's "insensitive"?

BURVqkrNaa	Sexy|`|YNj2i2Inaa	Sexy.<br>  <br>  But I'd rather actually be cute if we're judging by some objective standard.  It's just that when girls call me "cute" I often wonder if they're just feeling sorry for me or they don't respect me or they see me as the lesser man.<br>  <br>  When she calls you hot or sexy, you know you've go the respect.|`|bQCfOftxaa	haha.<br>  i once heard someone say, "when somebody calls you cute they mean: ugly, but interesting".  :) i don't think it's true-  but i thought it was funny.<br>  i'm a girl and sometimes i call my fiance cute...he doesn't seem to bother him, but i know he likes it a million times more when i call him sexy.|`|qZOuxR1Raa	Depends. Not too much of either. If u say cute a lot the girl might feel like shes not sexy or hot and feel like you look at her as if shes a little kid.

km9cQNAXaa	I left home at the age of 17 and joined the Royal Air Force.<br>  <br>  Best thing I ever did. Taught me a lot, enabled me to get my degree and see a lot of the world. Never went back although I get on well with both my parents.|`|QZ1siB8Qaa	I was 16 when I left the house. It was a decision that I had to do for myself, I knew that if I stuck around I wouldn't make much out of my life. I started college shortly afterwards...It was the best decision for me, I wouldn't change it if I could. <br>  It allowed me to see that changes can happen, and if you take a stand for something and don't back down, regardless how hard it may seem or what consequences you may be faced with, things will work out in the end and you will grow as a person since you have endured all that you were faced with.
aSih8i3Caa	My best friend is going out with a guy, who barely speaks english! He's Romanian I think, and needless to say, she doesn't know his language.<br>  Their relationship is purely physical however, so language barrier doesn't really affect them..mutual respect, patience, and understanding are key factors. Plus, they both bought dictionaries, to help understand eachother, which helps them a lot.<br>  Perhaps you should invest in one!!<br>  <br>  Good luck :]|`|JYHlPczxaa	When a person attracts the attention of the one that have an interest in, it's only half the battle. Now that this interest has been piqued, where do you go from here?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://1000questionsforcouplessecret.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1000questionsforcouplessecret.blo...</a><br>  <br>  Since the world is one big melting pot with the many different cultures in it, it is not simple to ask the love of your life or rather that affection that melts your heart and keeps you sane, for supper and drinks. There are many different rules on dating since there are many diverse cultures. While asking someone out could be simple, this often times not the case because any violations of differing cultures can make you a person of distaste and be ridiculed in the eyes of the one person who you wish to impress most.<br>  <br>  Many, if not most, individuals comprehend that not all the societies have identical views on relationships between a man and a woman. This means typically any minor infractions in the relationship are bound to go unnoticed. Yet, it is still important to understand the guidelines in your mate's culture. The people of the United States have, to a great extent, looser view on dating positions than those held by other countries.<br>  <br>  America's view on Dating -<br>  <br>  In America, physical touching is allowed on the very first date...although only hand holding and kissing at the end of the night is expected so long as both parties are interested in doing so. Should this not be the case of both parties, then the date would be long, boring and rather uneventful.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Well if you're dating you should have a common language. If you both speak english but one of you speaks a different language at home, then just only speak english when your with each other. It will be difficult when you go to meet each others parents (especially if they don't speak english) but other then that, the relationship has as much a chance as working as any other.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|AA12077420	The key is trying to understand each others' culture.I personally almost think that you should take more than the ordinary amount of time to get to know someone who has a completely different background than you would with someone of the same culture.A mutual respect for each other's feeling's regardless of your race should be well established long before you get too comfortable with each other.<br>   like any one, you can't change how they were raised and their view on life and relationships , but you can compromise which takes a little to a lot of work, but when an agreement is finally reached, it feels so good. For every problem there is a solution, it may mean to break up if it's just not going to work.<br>  It's important to remember we're all different and some thing's just take more time, but often times, when patient, what may seem too different can be worth waiting for and be exactly what you were looking for.|`|FgSTHArKaa	yes i have<br>  honeslty, after a while it really doesnt matter<br>  i got along so well with his parents...they treated me like their own daughter and he did with mine as well<br>  that stuff realyl doenst matter anymore<br>  i think the only real issue is religion<br>  but there are always good compromise with that<br>  the important thing is love.|`|uA4tJuZbaa	My dad's american and my mom's brazillian. Their relationship has worked out fine for almost 20 years.|`|ljiIgYFoaa	Yes I have been there. It takes alot of work and alot of respect in the relationship|`|3KdzluJNaa	Love. Love has its own language and culture.<br>  <br>  when you love, you put efforts in the relationship. you should make an effort to know each other's language and culture.<br>  <br>  I have a boyfriend who speaks and has a different writing character with me. I actually studied their form of writing and language. I make him my teacher from time to time. I also try to discover their culture by reading about it, watching their movies, listening to their music, and watching their channel, especially their news on cable.
gO9tl2uhaa	Wow, he's good, real good. Knows how to manipulate you. I mean the simple "I love you" HA! that's really really good.<br>  <br>  You know what? I had a girlfriend exactly like this. Aside the fact that there wasn't a 14 yr gap between us, the relationship was identical. I mean why in hell would someone keep pictures of his (her) exs? Never understood that.<br>  <br>  Well from my experience, I can tell you that the girl had HUGE issues. She did tell me something like you by the way about how her ex BEHAVED and how I didn't. She was a bit unstable emotionally and mentally.<br>  <br>  The fact is they know how to get you attached and control you. And it's really hard to get rid of those guys. It's like they got a plan to manipulate you, some kind of parasite. <br>  <br>  Anyway! It took me 3 months of that crap before I left her. I was near clinical depression. In those times, you just need to think about yourself and you ONLY. Because if you don't, NO ONE WILL.<br>  <br>  I know it's a bit egocentric, but you have to be strong. <br>  <br>  If someone doesn't make you completely happy, why do you stay with him?|`|oojO4WAraa	Dump him.

He is trying to control your appearance, the phone you own, your friends and family. He compares you unfavorably with previous girlfriends and has the nerve to expect you to pay for everything.

This guy is a loser, get out now!|`|3jqcLj7Saa	His text should have read I Love your money and as long as I can control you and you keep your mouth shut we will get along.

I dont say that to be mean but its clear that he is using you and taking advantage of your kindness. Guys like this prey on weak woman so i say that nothing will change until you change. he is a loser no doubt so work on yourself and then you wil attract someone in your life who will respect you and treat you like a woman should be treated.
qES5f0tqaa	Rent the movie Joshua and then you will no what to do good luck sounds like the boy need help and help now|`|CqoTqEu6aa	well if your brothers three and a half year old enjoys playing with knives and has easy access to them you should probably let them know so he doesn't accidentally poke his eye out ( or worse) ! They definitely need to keep their knives somewhere more out of reach or put a child lock on the cabinet that is really unsafe. <br>  <br>  That behavior is a bit strange, more so because he's only three and a half years old and most kids that age are just learning to draw circles let alone construct them out of knives. normal or not though tell your brother because that is REALLY REALLY UNSAFE.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	yeah, I think so.

F3LBgfvwaa	I think the best thing you can do is try to sympathize with her. It's messed up how people steal things but it happens to everybody, so you just have to be more careful in the future. I had about $100 worth of stuff stolen from me the other night, it was sitting outside my back door because I was spray painting it and somebody ran off with it. I wanted to punch somebody in the face. :P|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	send her a card, but not like a "I feel sorry for you card", maybe put something funny that happened in your neighborhood. or just give her you email address, tell her if she she wants to chat or something.|`|Z6cZxI6naa	What do you mean by car accessories?  Cd's, radio,phone,insurance. Well one thing you could do is buy her a gift card to a electronic store. This is safe because you can buy Cd's, maybe a radio. Or you could just give the gift of friendship, If you know she doesn't have many friends you could be her friend and comfort her. Good luck =)

I'd leave him in hopes that he will know he cant get away with something like that and still get what he wants, so whoever hes with next will probably have a better chance of him perhaps not cheating on her, since he now knows the consequences. That's me though.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	He cheated. Why should anything else matter? Leave him.|`|bO2rzfISaa	What's there to lose? Your self-respect, peace of mind and happiness. Years of your life (20 if you have kids with him). Seriously, he will not stop lying or cheating. My sister stayed with a cheater and she is destroyed mentally. She has no self-esteem and a number of mental problems (anxiety, eating disorder, relies abnormally on her children instead of her husband). Don't underestimate what you have to lose.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	I would never want to know exactly what happened that night. If they di something that he and I love to do I would be crushed and all that his story would remind me is how hurt I am about what he did. I couldn't handle that information. If you think that you could know this information and still be able to be with him, then more power to you. I say just sit him down and tell him that if he wants another chance with you there's only one way to do that. He needs to be as open and honest with you about what he did. If he won't do it, then tell him you want a sound reason as to why not.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	You already know the gist of what went down. The details will only break your heart. Why would you want to know those things? You can either forgive and forget or you can move on. Those are your options to make yourself happy.|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	honesty is a must...otherwise they just keep taking advantage of you...and like many other answerers said...it takes from your peace of mind.  no relationship can survive without trust...the doubt lies create will eventually tear you apart.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	you should demand some respect for yourself and leave.|`|72MtoWxRaa	Ask yourself this question, What gratification will you get knowing exactly what happened with him and her?  You know he cheated and had sex with her.  What is it exactly that you want to know? Position, length, etc?  Im not saying this to be smart. In my experience, knowing exactly what happened makes it 10 times worse. You will then image him having sex with her in the ways that you know about rather then just simple basic, “I CHEATED” .  I nor noone can tell you whether or not to take him back because that is in your heart and your choice, however, if you do truly want this man, you need to make him work for you and not just telling girls that he doestn want to disrespect you and not just calling his ex and telling her it was a mistake, but he needs to really prove it to you by being with you whenever you want, and taking you out to eat and doing things for you as if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you bcause if you forgive him so easily, this may happen again.  I understand that you want to know what happened exactly, but there is no good that will come of it.  If you wnat him back, accept what he did, forgive him and move on.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	I think you should save yourself the heartache, stess and constant questioning and move on. He's not THAT SPECIAL. There are guys out there that will NEVER cheat on you. You will NEVER know if he gave you ALL of the details. Chances are he NEVER will. He cheated and knowing all the little details will never make it all better. You will ALWAYS wonder what went on and if it ever will happen again. HE'S NOT WORTH IT!!!!!! MOVE ON!!!! YOU ARE WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN HIS CRAP!!!!|`|WU6pTTvCaa	You need to leave that alone.  Your currently not even a couple, if you were to start dating again, leave this painful issue in the past.  Ask yourself, what good could happen from finding out all the juicy stuff.  Would you hold that over his head for years to come?  He already told you he had a one night fling, so imagine he took it all the way and leave it at that.  Don't obsess about something that did not even involve you.|`|Z2xETWhbaa	I don't understand why you would take him back at all.  To me trust is everything.  Ask yourself this before you take him back.  Will you like the person that his cheating has made you become & can you live with being that person?  Meaning that every time he doesn't answer his cell phone or doesn't come home on time are you going to drive yourself nuts wondering if he is cheating on you again?  That is the biggest reason I could never forgive a cheater.  Also what is he doing still speaking with his ex.  Do they have kids together?   If I were you I would move on you should be able to have complete trust in someone.  Just one of the things that I truly love about me and my husbands relationship is that we are completly honest with one another.  Even if the other person doesn't necessarily want to hear it.  That way if there is a problem we fix it right away & move on.  Good luck to you|`|ZEitfScGaa	All I can say is that you may never get an answer out of him as to why he did what he did. You have to realize, altough in a different way your fiancee is hurting to because of what he did. He needs to be able to forgive himself too. I'm not saying what he did was right, its not. But there are two people here. I am not a believer of the saying "once a cheater, always a cheater". Many people make this mistake, even though they still love their partner more than anything in the world. It happens sometimes, it sucks. But often this makes a person realize how much they really do love who they are with, and they can turn themselves around. A lot of relationships grow stronger from this, even though it is the worst thing that can happen in a relationship. <br>  You have to sit down and think about this. Only you can decide what you want to have happen. Whether its to end it, or to try and move on and continue the relationship. Take your time, hold your head up, and do what you think is best for you. He did this to you guys, so he will have to deal with the consequences, whatever you decide.|`|oo3R4fVBaa	he'll probably do it again, i mean he couldn't behave for one day while you weren't there!? you should go find yourself a good man who respects you and wouldn't think of doing something like that to you just because it will break your heart. good luck! they're hard to find but they are out there!|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Dump him
6ea6d34e607603126e12379d095d0266aa	It's natural to feel that way, my son's birthday is on Christmas Eve and my daughter's is a week before.  They both feel a bit cheated so we try to celebrate it early in the month before all the holidays take priority.  It's not that people don't care, it's that they get so caught up in buying Christmas gift that they have little to spend for birthdays by then.  Try celebrating it at the early next year!|`|gRNnnCQfaa	hey! <br>  There is nothing wrong in you getting upset... but as a matter of fact it is nething but natural that u get upset for such things...<br>  But cmon.. You r 15 now..Y should u be jealous of others jus bcoz of the fact that they get gifts..?? Gifts arent really everything.....there is more to life.. If people dont give u gifts it doesnt mean they dont remember you or care for u .. .see it this way.. maybe they care for u soooo much that they dont want to limit their affection for u by giving u gifts which have a limited price.... so take it in a +ve sense.. if they dont give gifts be happy if ppl jus wish you .... hope this was of some help ! Keep smiling and all the best ! Take life as it comes and live it to the fullest :) :)|`|3g9Sq0ICaa	If you want people to care about you just go out and make more friends. A best friend will always remember your birthday.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	Do they love you still? yes.<br>  <br>  You'll find my dear as you get older the gifts become less...and less...<br>  birthdays gifts are a nice thought...but not something  people HAVE to do....<br>  so don't measure how much people love you by how many gifts they get you. <br>  If you feel like this then maybe say something...it can't hurt to be honest with people though.
LtMGBsI2aa	It's obvious that the guy likes you!  Just be yourself and have fun.  Chances are he's going to be trying to hang out with you more and texting you even more.  Let thing progress naturally and things will happen.  You'll be this guys gf in no time.  GOOD LUCK!|`|AA10266072	Ask him to hang out sometime.

That is exactly what i would do if i liked a girl.

And if for any reason a red flag comes up in your head then you should go with the red flag.  You never know who your dealing with..  Hope things work out for you.|`|TpSyUJi0aa	yeah he is definetly flirting...<br>  and he might like you but he hasn't met you.<br>  if he asks you to hang out don't turn him<br>  down it could be a good opportunity!
yr1hEsa0aa	My younger brother by far.  He's 3 years younger then me (I'm 21 he will be 18) It might be weird but we do know everything about each other. We used to fight horribly when we were younger but since about the ages of 13 and 16 we have been so close. We realized we could work together and get everything we wanted and get away with almost murder lol. <br>  I know he will always be there for me no matter what! And I'm the same for him. When things start to get to be to much. He is always the one that can keep me in check. He might be my little brother but he ways always there if a guy broke my heart he was there for me and to also let them know about it. I swear there is no brother better!|`|AA10166421	my papa.|`|l50LNHYKaa	If you count pets too my dog if not my dad<br>  my dad because he tends to be the most understanding out of all my family<br>  <br>  he doesnt judge me on the way i dress the music i like or my hobbies he loves me for me<br>  <br>  he is very easy to talk to about just anything at all <br>  <br>  and he tries to tell me things as nice as possible so we dont get into arguments|`|1dPVPcASaa	none really, my parents were always working so i don't talk to them much, I tell my older brother and oldest sister some things but never everything.

CfPQwq3Qaa	I think your/his requests sound very reasonable.  Her instability just aids your cause, just make sure you get the written documentation.  Also, if I were a judge I would ask what are her reasons for wanting the kids in that private school?  Are your considerations reasonable?  From what you listed it would be much more beneficial for the kids at the new school.  It would allow them more time for a normal childhood with extra-curricular activities that also help them down the road with things like working as a team, and related skills as well as college applications and such.  It's not like she can see them at school as a general rule anyway.  Changing schools would not change that.  So, if her visitation rights aren't hampered upon I don't see a problem.  Not to mention that a judge could actually rule to limit her rights given the situation anyway--although you don't seem to see a need to do so.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that your side is heard.  Sometimes rulings can be skewed if only one side is heard.  A judge/lawyer/official can only rule on the information given to them.<br>  <br>  There are some drawbacks to a public school, as I'm sure you know.  But the good points seem to outway the bad as long as any academic concerns can still be addressed.  Just keep in mind that there will be an adjustment time with your kids when they do switch, especially with the 13-yr-old.  Teenagers have a harder time emotionally with changing schools sometimes.  Maybe your kids could get contact info for their current friends and stay in touch after changing schools.<br>  <br>  Someone said something about why are you involved.  I think that it would be impossible for you not to be, but the judge is going to look to him and disregard you some because you are not bound to this legally (marriage).  That is just the way it works.  But it sounds like he is appropriately involved in the situation.  Also, if there is some parental agreement involving the school, it can be changed...and it doesn't sound like it is something she can afford anyway.|`|AA11452643	I believe your bf has a valid argument and a very winnable case in court. I take it he has custody and that will be a major advantage for him in court.|`|Ggjr6jkKaa	Yes, their mother is unstable and unfit, she will lose custody, and the kids are going to have to change schools.|`|XChiSgDZaa	I think you should triumph that is not unreasonable at all !! Those kids are lucky to have you and thier father !! keep us posted|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Why are you getting involved?  These are not your children.|`|DKGiGbxGaa	Sound like the kids need to changes school. Or move to where a school is close  and the school have all the things you looking for. In chicago they have something you can check out a  school and know what it all about and what they have to  often. Maybe that what you all need to do|`|Ltx89w04aa	Does your boyfriend have ANY documentation or proof of any of things his ex has been doing?  If not, then that may be a tough battle, and would really be determined on what the judge thinks.<br>  <br>  The best bet for winning cases like this - DOCUMENTATION.  Keep a journal at the very least - every time the ex does something whacko or not good for the kids, write it down.  Write down things she's said (like if she talked about her other ex being abusive or whatever) but DO NOT record the phone calls unless you know for a fact it's legal in your state.  In some states it is a crime to record conversations without the other person's knowledge.  Write down EVERYTHING - what he does for the kids, what she's done, etc.<br>  <br>  Courts tend to favor paper over accusations that can't be proved, so even if all you have is a journal, it is much better than nothing.  Starting a journal right before the court date, however, isn't going to help.  But he should start one now anyway for potential use in the future.<br>  <br>  Also, have him WRITE DOWN ALL of the points for his kids going to a different school to take with him to court (if he doesn't have a lawyer).  That will help him stay focused on the issue and provide a good argument for the court.  Do your research on the school he wants to send the kids to as well - note all positives about the school (good academics, great after-school programs, class size, etc.) to include with other points such as shorter bus ride, etc.  This will show the judge that your bf has thoroughly researched the issue and has based his conclusion on more than just convenience.<br>  <br>  If your bf does not have a lawyer, I suggest he gets one.  If he can't afford one, he should see if there is a Legal Aid or similar program in the area.  These programs provide lawyers and legal assistance to those who can't afford them.<br>  <br>  I know it's a tough situation - hang in there and good luck.|`|f94429414cd98123c4786b002c4a1354aa	i think you all are doing the right things as far as trying to change schools but i would suggest two things to help yall out  first get married its best for the kids to see a true family not just a live in b/f g/f  and he should get full custody of the kids from the mother and get her out of there life but anyway good luck|`|nMhbzKuJaa	How do the children feel? It seems all of the logistics have been discussed, but what about what they want? Since they have been in the same school for many years, it's likely they have bonded with classmates. <br>  <br>  I think it sounds like a good idea to change schools, just noticed that the kids opinion was not mentioned.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	you will triumph over instability.... the judge will see that your BF has his sh*t together... and she doesnt.. you guys win!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I think you have a very good chance at having the school changed.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You should have no problem in winning your case!

The judge only cares about issued that the kids will benefit from. You guys seem to really care about these kids. Please contact them they can help you!!!!|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	Well you need to get proof that she is unfit to make decisions, if the kids are staying with you most of the time, try to get full or primary custody, then you get to make those decisions. Keep records of her moving history, especially when she goes far away and leaves the kids. If you have a good lawyer and he can prove that he is better suited to be the primary custodial parent, then you shouldn't have much problems.|`|aQXgxTggaa	That sounds completely reasonable, and better for the kids, which is what the court cares about.  If they live primarily with you, they should go to the school closest to you.  Period.  All of the other stuff is just drama.  The mother would have to have some sort of reason that she wants them at that far away school beyond just wanting to make trouble for you.<br>  <br>  The court wants what is best for the kids and it sounds like what you want would be best.  Good luck.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	I think that if you go to court with all of these requests then you have a good chance of it being granted. You want what is best for these kids. ....and it shows and it will show to the court. If the mother wants them to stay in their current school then I would petition the court for extra child support so that you can afford to keep them in the current school.|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	K let me start with mine & explain how I did it. <br>  3 kids - 2 Dads 13 by 1st dad, 9, & 6 by 2nd, all attended the same school. 6yr. old told me he wanted to attend his home school (closest to our home) & so I dis-enrolled him from his siblings school & enrolled next day @ our home school. Dad # 2 took me back to court where he was told that it is in the best interest of the children to attend their "home school". The children have a greater chance at make friends next to home & participating in activities (sports, dance whatever) next their home with their friends. Dad tried to throw up that I just did it to inconvenience him but I had full physical custody. (as do you) My advice... do it & let mom take you back to court & if that's what the kids want, more times than not the courts will accommodate the kids!  Good luck ~ that's a battle I hate!! But do what the kids want!!
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Welcome to the terrible twos.  this is normal behavior, this age never wants to share ANYTHING and you just need to retrain her.  <br>  <br>  Short timeouts work very well here.  When she screams, hits and cries you tell her "no hitting.  Sara loves grandma (or mama) too." and then place her in a playpen or an isolated area alone for about 2 to 5 minutes (no more than 5 minutes) and you tell her why she's going into time out.  You stay where you can keep an eye on her but you let her cry or do whatever it is she is going to so in her timeout--you don't approach her until the time out is up.   You do it every time, no exceptions.  It should take about 2 weeks to correct or cut way back on the undesired behavior.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You punish her for her behavior by putting her in time out for two minutes, every single time she does it!  That's how she will learn to control her emotions, by being punished for improper behavior!  She should NEVER be allowed to hit or push another child!|`|ke0dsgkkaa	Can't tolerate such behavior now, it will only get worse if they can't accept others now. There has to be some time out, consequences for the acts. I wouldn't reward with gifts or anything, but when good behavior is practiced by the child, maybe have a alone day at the park with parent(s). Not to be harsh, but you have to get a grip on this now, before they start school. possibly even counseling, nothing wrong with getting help. Best to you, she will much happier child when taught to socialize instead of acting out.|`|6D4MqIrxaa	Give speicial time to her. I suggest spending a special day with her, let her know that she is so loved, but that she is not the only little on around. Take her to mommy and daughter classes, like a gymboree and let her be with kids her own age. I hope i helped, and best of luck!

I've felt that way before but I got over it because I knew what I did was the right thing for me, and though I may have hurt someone in the process it was the right thing to do for my own personal good, and in the end, no matter how much people will deny it, say they're different, etc. we all do what's best for us.  So don't feel guilty for standing up for yourself, because no one ever got anywhere by succumbing to those around us.

AA11492911	Sweetheart you have to realize some girls don't see a good thing when it smacks them in the face. They would rather stick with the guy that smacks them around literally. You have to move on there is no other way you did do the right thing though. You tried to save her and protect her. I commend you on that. <br>  <br>  There is no saving this girl from herself. Move on and give the golden heart to a girl who deserves it. Change your number. Quit asking her out or even to hang. you know and either you will open up time to find a good woman or You never know she may realize what she had when she loses it but in the end you would still be better off with someone else. If she is willing to be with this person and have a baby at 15 then she obviously isn't the girl you need as you (you told her mom to try and help her) are obviously more responsible than that. I hope this helps in some way.|`|5SCD87hTaa	now i am going to start out by making me a little un popular with you but i think it needs to be said first. it really does sound like you are jealous. now having said that jealousy is not always a bad thing. <br>  <br>  to start out what you did was not bad. 15 years old is young to be sleeping around and no girl, regardless of age, should be abused by a boyfriend. going to her mother was the right move but how you write her reaction was doesn't sound right. from reading this i don't think that you told her they were sleeping together. if you did the mother would not let her talk to that boy again. anyways her mom needs to know about their sexual relationship. that should solve most of your problems.<br>  <br>  now that you are a little happier i am going to throw in some constructive criticism. from the sounds of it i do not think she likes you the way you like her. there is not a girl in this world that if you told them you loved her and she felt the same way she would not tell you back unless she did not want to hurt you. this is not the case for you. right now she doesn't want to be with you for whatever reason and you are going to have to deal with that. if you care for her and want the chance to be with her you are going to have to back off. you are going to have to be the friend that she right now needs you to be, cause in a second i am going to tell you how you are going to make her life suck for a little bit but be better off in the long run. she is going to need a friend, someone that cares about her. and if you are that person you are going to have to be able to show her that your felling for her are not going to come before what she needs from you. it is ok to like her but that is just not what she needs now. <br>  <br>  I am going to take a stab in the dark and say all three of you are in highschool. i am also going to trust you on your statement that he does drugs. if that statement is not %100 true do NOT do this next step. (pot is not a big enough drug) it will hurt you and she will never want you back. what you need to do is take care of him. you say he does coke. you need to tell your school principle this. if he is a druggy that does that hard of drugs then he needs to go to jail. to help your friend you need to help him to go there. a bust with coke or ex will send him to juvi for a while. this will end his abuse relationship with her. your pricipal will keep this between you and them. she will not know it was you. for your sake keep it that way. <br>  <br>  next be there for her the next couple of months, do NOT bring up dating her. if she even for one second thinks you had anything to do with it or you are trying to take advantage of a situation you are toast. you let her take the time she needs and make the next move. if you are not willing to take your time on this and you can't wait you need to stop talking to her. you are just going to hurt the one you care for.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Move on, maybe she will realize what she is doing if your not around to be nice to her.|`|71VRvldJaa	You can't help someone who doesn't want to help themself!  I think you've done quite enough to help her.  She's sinking but obviously hasn't hit bottom yet....but she will.<br>  You really need to move on.  This girl will only bring you down.
zzaScg0haa	Maybe he is interested in more and doesn't think you are
e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	If you are not cheating and your girlfriend is unable to handle you having a female friend. You need to make a choice. Do you want to maintain a relationship with a girlfriend who is so insecure and untrusting. Or do you want to loose the friendship with your friend Julia? Personally, I do not understand why people cannot be friends "all together". Talk to your girlfriend and find out why she is feeling so insecure about your friendship? Are you not including her in the friendship, are you contributing to her feelings of insecurity? Or is she simply immature, insecure and controlling? Only you can answer these questions. If it is the later, get rid of the girlfriend.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	what are they saying? maybe you just need to confront her privately and tell her that you like HER and if you didn't and you liked julia, you would be with her. tell her there is a reason you are with her. Remind her you guys are only friends and you and Julia don't agree with cheating because she was cheated on. so she wouldn't do that to april. maybe you should hang out with her more and give her more reasons to trust her like talking to her more and letting her know what you're doing more. the best thing in a relationship is communication. try it. it will work.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|QIYHApEkaa	If she feels that insecure about it theres a reason for it. Did you ever cheat on her? I'll take the high road and assume that you haven't, Try talking to her about this and ask why besides the fact that "everyone" is saying it does she belive the rumor, also has the girl julia been a freind of yours before or after you started dating april, if the answer is you've known julia longer than april it could just be a jelousy thing, does april have "guy friends" and how do you feel about that? It has to be a two way street in a realationship, if it is in fact that you are "just freinds" with julia then you have to explain to april that you've been friends with julia for a long time and that it's unfair for her(april) to expect you to give up a friendship, also do they know each other? If april has never met with julia that could cause a problem. <br>   The bottom line is if april does'nt trust you then it's time to move on|`|dksB1B0Laa	She probably thinks that you are cheating, because she has had the experience of being cheated on before, so when she hears that someone else that she is with is cheating on her of course she's not going to really believe you. I believe these people are saying these things, because they don't want you to be with her. This same thing happened to me. Sit down with here and explain to her about how much you love her ad tht everyone is saying these things, because they are jealous.|`|d55czOsQaa	aww i feel bad no oneis answering this ):<br>  <br>  However i have an answer :)...say to  her<br>  <br>  Look its up to you to believe other people over me, i cant force you to do anything, the only thing im telling you to do is believe me and that im not lying to you. I love you so why would i lie to you. And if you really loved me, you would believe me over anyone else.<br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE I  HELPED :)|`|jXIS4npBaa	If she cant trust you then leave her, then in the end shell know you were right.|`|i8hfnvq6aa	IF YOU NOT CHEATING ON HER DO SOMETHING TRUST WORTHY TO SHOW HER YOU NOT LYING....HOPE DIS HEPLS
iVnQ4aCiaa	I think your theory is spot on.|`|AA11227341	sounds possible some guys feel the same way.  I don't know for sure since you are saying that this one girl like to receive but not give and this makes her want to be another woman so if the guy gives her oral she would not want to be with a woman?  Not sure, never heard or needed to help one with this issue.  but possible|`|8vfCRg7Caa	no its not a myth, its just not honest. its still cheating. boy girl, boy boy, girl girl. Same difference. Now if you have an open relationship, thats totally something different. i guess some people have that. Society has made it exceptable for women to bi. But its truly the same thing as cheating. Sorry society has some stupid *** rules and beliefs|`|xgJbxZgfaa	that's sick|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Okay, I am a straight female, so I may be missing something in the logic behind "sleeping with a girl isn't cheating", but to me, any physical contact with anyone other than your partner is cheating unless the partner is around or aware of it (and approves of it).  Girls that act like you've described are just trying to justify their slutty ways. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend doesn't like giving oral, but he doesn't need to.  Guys only need to be good at oral if they aren't good at other things, imo. My boyfriend has never had a problem getting me to finish, and I've never forced the issue.  Most of the girls in my group of friend feel the way I do. As long as we get ours, who cares how.|`|bLUgbyLHaa	I personally do not know that many guys that don't like giving oral. I know that it is my favorite part of sex their is nothing like giving a woman pleasure this way and I personally enjoy the taste i hope my answer does not get me in to trouble.for being open and honest I just happen to really enjoy giving oral sex.|`|74gPuaXMaa	Your theory is wrong. Man, or women, if they give, they give. But messing around with another woman while with someone, that is cheating.|`|W6wamWLLaa	Yes you're theory is wrong and it doesn't matter who u cheat with<br>  Cheating is cheating|`|Cj3YffS2aa	yuk|`|dDefa6kfaa	Hey al lick that if u let me hit me back ASAP|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Oral- Are more women saying if you won't do it i'll find someone who will .....Not this girl<<<<

tyl9aSu9aa	You're being very petty. <br>  <br>  He went out of his way to propose to you in what he thought was a perfect way, and you apparently love him, assuming you said yes.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're going to let this eat you up inside, you really don't deserve him - you deserve to be left alone with your little girl fantasies of how this day was supposed to go, and your idea of how he messed up. Otherwise, in a few months you're going to be on here, saying your wedding was so nice but this and but that, and then down the line you'll be on here, wondering why your marriage is so unhappy.<br>  <br>  No one lives up to the fantasy all the time, and part of being a grown up is understanding that, and loving people not just in spite of their flaws, but a little bit because of him.<br>  <br>  Do you really want to marry this man, and have a successful marriage? Then you need to quit putting this man up on a pedastal and being surprised - and hurt -when he falls off.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you know what, I don't feel bad for you on your worst day.<br>  1- you spent xmas eve with your honey and not a bunch of annoying family friends like I did<br>  2- you have been to paris.  quit your complaining!<br>  3- you have a ring and a good man.  so what he's not as effusive as you and didn't want to get down on one knee in public even though he'll never lay eyes on any of the people that were around y'all ever again.  he's just more private and you need to respect that he's different from you.  the fact you don't do things the same way makes you more compatible.  you don't want a man who does every little thing you tell him, that's a pushover!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	He proposed in such a romantic way, girl!!  Paris?  Biggest Christmas Tree?  Cuddling?  Sounds like a very intimate setting...  Which makes it nice why he DIDN'T get down on one knee.  It was a moment just between the two of you, not the whole world...  Which, it should be!!  It's about you and him :)<br>  <br>  Be happy about it.  He did a phenomenal proposal!! :)<br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|uBssj3Znaa	SO basically you are telling me it was perfect and this is the man you want to spend the rest of your life with, but because he didn't get down on one knee you are disappointed?<br>  <br>  You are being completely unreasonable. Be happy your man did everything he did for you and loves you as much as he does. That really is the most important thing after all.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	My fiance didn't go down on one knee either, and honestly I was too speechless and overcome with feelings of joy to really give a crap! <br>  <br>  In the grand scheme of things, it's really not all that important. You got your romantic proposal, even if it wasn't exactly how you envisioned it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	If you already know it's a selfish thought, why are you posting the question?

He took you all the way to Paris, proposed under a huge tree on Christmas Eve, and you're complaining?!<br>  <br>  Get over it.|`|wqL84O8Naa	wow?? wish him good luck for me, you sound like a completely self centered ungrateful bleep|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I'm with the Dr.  Marriage is going to be a rocky dead end road if nothing ever pleases you.|`|R7b150Iyaa	I'm going to go against the grain on this one and NOT call you selfish or petty.  I understand what you mean: you are extremely happy and excited to be engaged to the man you love and adored his proposal, but I think it is ingrained in us from childhood that in order for the moment to be truly romantic, the man must get down on one knee.<br>  <br>  My fiance proposed in Jamaica, under the moonlight and palm trees, on a curving walkway between the beach and hotel pool.  Absolutely amazing.  However, there were people walking by and he also didn't get down on one knee.  In retrospect (about a week after we came back and I got off my high from being engaged and having the most gorgeous ring ever), I thought a little bit about him not getting down on one knee and it bugged me a tiny bit too.  I think I even told people the story with him getting down on one knee (a friend of mine proposed to his girlfriend without getting down on one knee and we still make fun of him).  But the bottom line is, none of it matters.  Look how much thought your fiance put into the proposal: Paris, Christmas, cuddling....AMAZING.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this helped put things into perspective for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!<br>  <br>  PS We went to Paris for Valentine's day a year before we actually got engaged and everyone thought he would propose there...he didn't.  Lol.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Here's a shove in the "feeling happy" direction: <br>  <br>  My fiance gave me the ring (I knew it was coming) on Christmas morning in my PJ's in front of his sisters, nephews & niece (who I don't really care for all that much).  He didn't even ASK me "will you marry me?".  He just put the ring on my finger and that was it!<br>  <br>  You got a gorgeous location, and he actually asked you THE question.<br>  <br>  Not everybody's proposal is exactly as they could have dreamed it would be.  I'd have been thrilled to not have my in-laws forever etched in my memory on the day I got my engagement ring.|`|woOeYFrEaa	My husband didn't get down on one knee and I don't even think he technically asked me to marry me, he just handed me the ring.  But you know what?  We're blissfully happy being married and are getting close to our 1 year anniversary.  Your engagement is one tiny moment in an entire lifetime together.  It sounds like he got most of the factors right.  Realize this is real life and not going to be magically perfect like you see in movies.  Otherwise your wedding is probably going to be a big disappointment too.  Take joy in the good things you have experienced.|`|AA11220327	it sounds like you had a great proposal to me. Let me give you an example. the day that my husband proposed to me, he never really did, lol. I know that sounds weird, but its true. the minute he took out the ring, he was so choked up and teary that he couldnt even get the words out. I still tease him to this day that he never really proposed, but i was never dissapointed with how it happened, because I get to spend the rest of my life with the man of my dreams either way.|`|023ccdc2611ee634032321712b19450baa	Oh Cry Me a River, girl! you got an incredibly romantic proposal from what sounds like a very thoughtful and romantic guy who loves you! Get over it and be happy! the details are so not important, if you really love this guy and want to spend the rest of your life with him, the knee part should be totally irrelevant. Congratulations on your engagement, and don't give it another thought!|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Hello! You were proposed to in PARIS!!! need I say more? Any girl would love to have the proposal that you had. The knee is so overrated and it's not the point. The point is the question. You need to focus on the rest of the situation. And be so grateful of the wonderful proposal he gave you. Your proposal is more than most girls could ever dream of.|`|U18g98GWaa	you should feel happy about this! its great that he chose a place and day that is special to you. the next best thing after a proposal is the wedding. and im sure you'll get to choose everything that goes along with that. so even though he didn't propose the exact way you wanted, just remember that thats just a little piece out of the bigger things that come along. congrats!|`|q6GnofENaa	Um... why should it even matter how he proposes to you? If you love him it shouldn't.  My finacee didn't even propose, i don't even have an engagement ring! Because I don't care and I love him to death. All we did was talk about when we were going to get married and that's about it.  He even remebered your favorite day and you were in Paris... I feel sorry for your fiance.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	At least you got a proposal.  My husband just talked about marrying me for at least six months before I finally told him "We're getting married on X date at X time at X place.  Be there."  Even though I didn't get an actual proposal, I couldn't be happier with my wonderful husband.  I don't quite understand why people can't be happy with what they have rather than always wanting more.|`|FgRiw5CLaa	plans change and as long as your happy it does sound like he cares about you ALOT i woudnt sweat it he did everything else that he thought you would like|`|m7m9Xu24aa	I've heard of proposals where all the man does is say:"Looks like we've got everything but the hardware."<br>  <br>  Why are you complaining again?|`|Z6mKM1DOaa	No.  Your fiance should be annoyed that he's tethered himself to a selfish, whiny little girl.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	wow you sound very selfish and ungrateful. Just because he did not do it as you would have liked you are some how unhappy? so sad!|`|gIqRs5buaa	Sounds a pretty good proposal to me, I would be happy if i were you.|`|LOuK0Ysiaa	nothings perfect ...learn to love ur imperfect moment ...gettin down on one knee is soo cliche|`|CkN4pgpCaa	That sounds like the perfect proposal!  I can't tell you how to feel, but I think that you should not be upset that he didn't get down on one knee.  It was a big moment for him too, and it's very intimate- It can be sort of intimidating when lots of other people are watching!  I'm sure he put a lot of thought into the proposal...  they can plan it out, but sometimes emotions or circumstances can change 'the plan' a bit.  My fiance could barely remember his name when he proposed to me... he was so nervous.  It's a big moment.  Just be happy that he put a lot of thought into and proposed to you.  Now you can start planning your wedding and life with him!|`|wVZuBL0Zaa	Your Fiance went to all that thoughtfulness and trouble to give you a romantic proposal and because he didn't get down on one knee it makes you unhappy? Honey you need to wake up! Yes, as you know you are being selfish and you need to get over that. My now husband had a romantic dinner cruise planned out to propose to me. We arrived and had a romantic table over looking the water, candles, flowers, and champagne. Only problem was it was EXTREMLY cold and windy and the boat couldn't leave the dock! He talked to the captain of the ship who arranged for him to propose to me in the captains quarters at the front of the ship. He did go down on one knee and said such wonderful things to me. He felt guility over the cruise being reunined but I ddn't care because I had him!! If you truly love your Finace see all that he did to be romantic and make you happy and get over the whole issue with goign down on one knee! Your proposal is way more romantic this most women get!

It doesn't matter which one, Women who attend church regularly do so because they have a very decent side of them.  They have faith hope and charity.. They have a desire to be a better person or at least to seek encouragement to that end.  I've heard the saying "when things get tough, and they will, you will always find them where you found them". I guess what that means is if you start a relationship in a bar, when things get tough they may go back to a bar.  If you found them in a relationship with someone else, then maybe that's where you will find them later in life.  If you find someone at church, hopefully when things get tough she will turn to a genuine support group not a peer preasure group.  Is that what you are looking for?  Someone of substance and dignity?|`|0EUBc2hRaa	I have to agree that you will have to look for that person at church.<br>  <br>  You might want to make sure that you have the same things to offer that you are looking for.<br>  I wish you well.|`|hizUz9rDaa	you cant just search and find one. everyone has flaws. you could try to enter internet dating site and get to know people. but as far as searching for one i dont think that will work.
vlCWp7sSaa	Well, you really shouldn't worry what other people think. And your ex is an ex for a reason. She's another thing that can just go out the door. Sometimes the best thing to do is go up to her and start a conversation. And say "Hey, I noticed you go to my Church.

NOTHIN- if your ex did tell her smthin than tell your ex that you 2 broke up for a reason. and if you really like her just be brave suck it in walk up to her and ask her. and for me who cares if they found out you like someone i mean people gossip all the time about unneccissary thing they may tlk for a week or so but then they move on to someone else to tease. so hun go tlk to her. mmmm, maby she likes you to!! :) GOOD LUCKKKKK!!!!
lwXGNizGaa	I can proudly say that I have fallen in love (and as someone who did not believe in love for a long time that's saying a lot) and am still in love with the same amazing girl who claims to love me just as much (but I don't know how she could).  As far as I know she has no faults but if she did I'm not sure I would notice (haha, I'm kidding of course. Her faults are actually very frustrating to me at times but I'm able to overlook them).<br>  <br>  For me love is like, the worst thing you could ever do to yourself.  It feels like a part of you is stretched every time they leave your side and you can only be truly comfortable when you're around them.  Love means wondering every day if the next day could possibly be as good as today was.  Of course, the good far outweighs the bad because so far every day has been better and when she's around I'm happier than I've ever been in my life no matter what's going on.|`|KnjlEYwEaa	Yes, I have fallen in love several times. No, the previous "loves" I had all turned out to be awful, however I am in love with a wonderful girl right now that cares about me as much as I care about her. We both have our mistakes, like normal human beings, but true love overcomes everything in the end from my point of view. To be in love to me means that you are willing to go through the extremes to be with this person and that you want to spend every waking moment (within reason...) with this person. When you are in love with someone, the relationship between you and the other person must be strong; strength in relationships are based off of love, trust, similarities, and overall compatibility. Overall compatibility would include things such as whether or not you are able to find time for each other, whether or not your families get along, etc.|`|k4AMEYv7aa	Yes i have fallen in love, i loved him for years, and we got closer and then he asked me out. I was so happy and felt so special because I'd liked him for so long but hadn't told him because im too shy. Well anyway, he got really drunk and got off with a girl at a party a few months after we got together. He felt really guilty about it and i didn't find out until one of his best friends blabbed. I had a massive arguement and was truly quite mean. I ended it there and then and I have to admit i regret ending it. For a few months after he still used to tell me he loved me,  and although i did, i wouldnt say it back because i felt he was just saying it for the sake of it. Well anyway because I wasn't showing interest he decided to move on and is now going out with the girl he cheated on me with. He still acts like he likes me, and i do still love him. But love hurts. :||`|fxvC7pmJaa	I have fallen in love but for me it was too late when i realized i found the man of my dreams. Love for me feels like well its hard to explain maybe breath taking?!

People change so you learn to let go. Things go wrong so you appreciate when things are right. You hear lies to learn to trust yourself and good things fall apart so that better things can fall into place. Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people who treat you right; forget about the ones that don't and just believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said that it would be easy; they just promised that it would be worth it. Maybe the reason we try and hold on to things so tight is because we are scared they'll never come again. Life is about trusting your feelings and taking chances.

It's a bit mysterious and full of hope.  You feel like the old you is gone, and you're ready for that new day, but you're also afraid of leaving that in between place, because it's perfect and part of you knows it can't last forever.|`|hAo1GmZaaa	yes i have... ive been in love with this person for a year now and well he didnt really notice how much at first but now he knows and its the greatest feeling ever. when im with my guy i feel like im floating, like no one else is even alive, even if we are in a room full of people, we are alone becuase i feel as if we are connected. love to me is special. yess there will be many people you will fall in love with but when u find that person its unbelieveable, really i didnt even explain it good enough. its a feeling you have to find out for yourself and when u are in love you will kno becuase u cant stop thinking of that person and your constantly concerned and you get major butterflies in your tummy when u even think their name. with my guy, he has many fualts but thats what makes him him. he wouldnt be the same, and some things i could even help him with. so there you go :)|`|bQCfOftxaa	yes. yes still in love. yes he loves me. see his faults yep...i love this quote: “Love isn't finding a perfect person. It's seeing an imperfect person perfectly.” it's about understanding, forgiveness, communication, and acceptance.<br>  lots of feelings come with love: sometimes they're amazing and 'warm' feelings, other times it's hurt and dissappointed feelings.  but i think one of the most impotant things to remember about love is that it is a choice.  "Choose Your Love, Love Your Choice."|`|nGdH31Ucaa	yes i have fallen in love... it's an amazing feeling<br>  when it lasts. when i was with this boy, sleeping<br>  at night felt like a waste of time because all i wanted<br>  to do was be with him.<br>  <br>  i was fasinated with everything he did, said.<br>  he was so funny. <br>  <br>  we're not together now, but there isn't a day that<br>  goes by i don't think about him.. or want him back.<br>  i miss him more and more and wish things didn't<br>  have to be this way.<br>  <br>  and i hate the saying "everything happens for <br>  a reason." because... i don't understand, we were<br>  perfect together.|`|tIg3low2aa	I am married to the man I fell in love with for almost 30 years!

nX1QW5GCaa	Where I live, all the forms and even some advice on procedure are available on government website.  In my case, it's the province of Ontario, Canada.  <br>  Not sure where you live, but I'd recommend paying a visit in person the the court that handles divorce proceedings in your area and speak to a clerk for some advice on how/where to get started. <br>  It isn't easy and the laws are confusing as hell, but it is possible if you're prepared to spend the time.  You can also get a 1 hour consultation with a divorce lawyer for not too much money.  It could turn out to be a good investment that saves you a ton of time and trouble.<br>  Good luck!|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	go to www.legalzoom.com click on divorce.

There are many sites, however I went with this one because I've heard a lot of negatives about the other sites, and nothing but positives about this one.

When you use the forms over the net it tends to irritate the courts and they reject it and strongly encourage you to retain a lawyer.<br>  <br>  If it is non-contested depending where you are you and your ex can go into a lawyers office or you both can write up an agreement have it signed, witnessed, and given to a lawyer to serve for minimal price and effort.<br>  <br>  Depending on what State you live in a lawyer can do this anywhere from $200 to $300.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|9W48OvAraa	Check with your local community resource center or the states.

She left her husband for a man that she was having an affair with. They ended up getting married, and it went down hill from there. She would call me several times a day, every day and even come to see me. Cause she wanted 'advice' on how he was treating her. cheating on her with his ex's, stealing, getting arrested, hitting her, calling her names ect.... the list goes on. I would give her good advice, but she wouldn't ever take it. Instead she would make up some excuse as to why it was ok, or why she should stay with him. <br>  <br>  Eventually after about a year of going through this with her, I ended our friendship. I couldn't be part of her drama anymore, especially if she wasn't going to do anything to help her self. I haven't spoke to her in 3 months, and she's still going through the same crap with him, because one of our mutual friends came to me telling me that she's getting tired of hearing her cry and whine yet she won't leave him for anything. <br>  <br>  At some point you will grow tired of it as well, and more than likely you will end up cutting her out as a friend as well.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Yes you are right, your sister in law is better off without him and you hate seeing her upset.

"Love is blind"<br>  I've been there, and just about everyone I know has been there. With some guy who treats you like dirt, and everyone else but you can see it. You don't want to see it because you want to believe that they love you. You don't want to accept the fact that you put more into it than them, and you just can't let go. So you adapt to it, you expect it, and you live with it. Because doing that seems a lot easier than the heartbreak.<br>  As an outsider, you wonder what the hell they are thinking. You wonder why they put up with it, and you know that they would be better off leaving. But you are not the one that has to face the heartbreak<br>  it's a crappy situation, but the best thing to do is to let her go, support her, be there when she needs you.

It took my sister 11 0r 12 years and another pregnancy to finally get it through her head. She knew her man was lying and cheating, she even spoke to one of his females but nobody could make her see reality.  One day they got into a huge fight and he told her he had another daughter with some woman, and that the only reason he got her pregnant again was that he was getting revenge on her.  That pretty much took care of their relationship but it took a toll on her.  I am glad you are staying out of it because I didn't we did not speak for almost a year behind it.

I'm sure there's dozens of books that try to explain it.  I think most times it comes down to the fact that they still believe he will change and they still love him on some level.  <br>  She's the only one that can make the final break and all you can do is continue to stand by and help pick up the pieces.  You can give her your opinion but don't push it to the point where she breaks off your relationship with each other.

So your sister in law's standards are pretty low and she is afraid that if it's not going to be him, it's gonna be nobody 4 her! :(  Somehow she needs to see examples of how it COULD be for her..by seing other happy couples, by meeting a nice man. Maybe then she can see the difference between healthy and un-healthy.<br>  <br>  She is also insecure and needs to make a list of positive qualities and abilities that she has. Her friends and family must support her and encourage her in her activities. Only then her self-worth will ascend.Then she will see how undeserving she is of an unhealthy hurful relationship.

If this guy really loves you then he will come back to you and make sure he keeps you happy.... Things happen for a reason and right now the whole thing about him trying to figure himself out if just happening for a reason.... Just give him time and wait because you never know he might realize that you are the perfect one for him and thats the thing he didn't realize and needed time for...|`|3KdzluJNaa	Give him time to think. If he really loves you,he'' go back to you. Be patient.|`|BZOD8h71aa	If its past its past, no need to write an essay bout it.|`|QZ1siB8Qaa	Give him some space. With graduation approaching, he may be thinking about what his future holds for me without anyone else in the picture...He wants/needs time to figure things out before he can have someone else in the picture. Hence 24/25 you are starting your career, getting situated, etc. If he really loves you would want things to work out if you both were older, in time it will work out. But in the meantime, you shouldn't wait around because it may not happen...Sorry but thats life. Good luck!

764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	How important is sex to a marriage?? HUGE to some people otherwise, no one would choose to wait until marriage to have sex. If sex before marriage is such a big deal, how can it all of a sudden not be a big deal during the marriage? People downplay sex for convenience sake or to make themselves appear more wholesome than they actually are. Some people on here are exceptionally fake because I often see questions where, within a couple, one person wants to have sex and one person wants to wait and the common answer is for the person is to leave because that person doesn't respect you. How come that same respect isn't given to a married man or woman whose spouse refuses sex? The common answer here is that marriage isn't all about sex. But, wasn't it just about sex or rather not having sex, when it came to a couple who were looking towards marriage? There's a huge contradiction out in society about sex and I don't at all like it. <br>  <br>  So, in my opinion, divorcing over sex makes sense- only it's not divorcing over sex. It's divorcing from a partner who isn't willing to compromise and be reasonable. If it can be said that a person is within their right to withhold sex simply because its their body and they don't feel like it, the ONLY answer would be to walk away from that situation. You can't control anybody else, just yourself. So, if I was in that guy's predicament, divorce is how I would've handled it.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Not a legit reason in my book.  Divorce should really only be because of adultery, abuse, or abandonment.<br>  <br>  I would strongly advise this couple to seek medical help to rule out why no interest in sex any more.  There are other ways to satisfy each other, and both should make the effort to do so.<br>  <br>  What about couples who have an accident and can't have sex and yet stay together because they LOVE each other thru good and bad times?|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	it IS a legitimate reason TO MARRY so YES, lack of can be a legitimate reason for divorce.|`|7royFhIgaa	The marriage should not just be based on sex.|`|bO2rzfISaa	When I was 16 my mom told me sex wasn't that important. I told her she was wrong, and now I know she was. I suspect she was one of those women who withhold sex. That absolutely IS a reason to divorce. Sex is part of marriage, and those who choose to withhold should expect to be divorced. Male or female.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Being unable is different, though I think all options should be explored to solve the problem.  Yes, I'm sure 75% of women say it's a bad reason to divorce. I think they make up the majority of the withholders, though my personal experience has been with men.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I did just that. I was 37 however when that happened. No sex isn't everything but it was an important part when we got married and it was to me throughout the marriage. My ex made the decision herself to stop whether I wanted to or not. This is not how marriage works either. If your friend wants a sexual marriage or relationship then it's best to move on now while there are still women available who do. Trust me there are more than he'll be able to handle.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Sounds to me like it's more than just sex, but a lack of respect for his needs. The underlying issue would be selfishness on her part. Just because she doesn't have an interest in it anymore doesn't mean she should deny her husband of it. My husband has a much higher drive than me, but sometimes you just have to suck it up and please your man. What she is doing is selfish, not him.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Sex is part of the marital package...so much so that either partner can be granted a divorce over "loss of congress".<br>  <br>  Sorry...but i think it's wrong to expect someone to give sex up simply because you "lost interest."<br>  <br>  Your wife might see the other side of it if you suddenly stopped sleeping with her. <br>  <br>  Good luck to your friend.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	It is if the people involved believe it is a valid reason.  Most states allow lack of sexual intimacy as a reason for divorce, so even legally the answer is yes.|`|qeLikL8Haa	depends on the marriage i would say that's a very big factor in weather you two can work together|`|LVlS4y7Caa	If this couple still love one another, and frankly, it sounds as if they don't - then while their world doesn't need to revolve around sex, I believe she is making a real mistake in withdrawing from the intimacy entirely.  She apparently is WILLING <which understandably, leads me to believe she no longer loves the man...> to forego this part of their love life at a rather early age, why????  Is it just with him?  Could she be swept off her feet by another?  What GIVES here?  Methinks y'all only know half the story and one can't really have an educated opinion just knowing half...<br>  <br>  Frankly?  As most of us age, the libido often can too in the sense OTHER very valuable traits and gifts take over in the relationship sustaining the love.  While sex is still there, it isn't near as important as it was in our 20's/30's.<br>  <br>  Don't know what to say, except I hope she doesn't regret her decision to allow this, and frankly, I'd want to know the root cause of her no longer wanting to be intimate with him - because trust me, there IS a root cause...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|cHiv6eTWaa	I can see where men would divorce over it but I think this couple can save this marriage with some knowledgeable advice instead so I'll give a whirl. I am a women in my 40's so I understand where she is coming from. All woman in their 40's have decreased hormone levels as they enter in to premenopause which leads them to feel less like having sex and also makes them dry down below. Two things to do to fix this issue one is get hormone replacements from the OB/GYN doctor to increase the sexual desire and then get some estrogen cream to fix the dryness issue. With some hormone therapy and the cream all should level out and be back to normal and the desire will return. This is normal for woman at this age it's not a reason for a divorce it's a reason to go get some medical help that will fix the problem.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Anyone who thinks this is not a good enough reason is a mindless zombie regurgitating the same cliche that "sex is not everything". Lack of sex is no more or less shallow than infidelity or lack of respect for your partner. It's not an issue if both partners don't want it, but neither would be fidelity if both partners want an open marriage. <br>  <br>  If it is important to one person then it is important, especially if it was a part of the relationship before hand.  There are ways to get around this, but it is selfish to expect your spouse to sacrifice sex simply because you no longer desire it. The people pointing to medical reasons are missing the point. Not being able to do it and refusing to are 2 different things. If one spouse is injured and cannot work then you take care of him, if he refuses to work then no one is going to say "well marriage is more than money and going to work". Everyone is entitled to their opinions but some of these are mindless.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. Well I understand that there's more to a marriage than just sex, but guys do have needs, and if his needs arn't getting met its understandable that he may want to end the relationship. I think its fine. At least he's doing the honorable thing, and getting a divorce instead of cheating on her behind her back. I think that sex is very important to have in a marriage, its not everything, but its important. good luck.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	It's either divorce or he will start to look elsewhere.  I'm sure there are marriages where both parties agree to this kind of thing.  Sex is a huge part of any marriage and if only one wants it, it can lead to all kinds of tension and the arguments will eventually spill over into other areas. <br>  So, either she looks the other way and hopes that any women he finds are just for "pleasure" or she grits her teeth and "bares" it (pun intended).|`|pOTigVYPaa	My former husband was in an accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down.  We didn't have intercourse for 8 years.  Part of the reason for my divorcing him was due to the lack of sex because although his mouth and fingers weren't paralyzed, he refused to use them on me.  There were other ways to achieve a happy sex life other than his male genitalia, but you couldn't convince him of that.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	marriage is not about sex.  If it is, then the relationship is doomed from the beginning..  as a married truck driver in my late 40's, i "go without" for long periods of time and its no big deal.  my relationship with my wife is not based on sex.  Its based on trust and respect.  So i would say lack of sex is NOT a legit reason for divorce.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	They are still young!  Why isn't she interested anymore?<br>  She may need a Dr or some counseling.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think it is reason to divorce.  Unless of course both parties have lost interest.  But if one still wants it, well then they need to leave.<br>  <br>  Hey at least the guy is being straight up about his wants rather than cheating on her.|`|hCfjvfswaa	That would be a shallow reasoning. There is much more to marriage than physical contact. Out of a recent study done, more than 75% of married woman said that physical contact come's last out of the top ten reasons for divorcing/great marriage.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	No they should find a way to work through it, I love having sex with my wife and we do it often, but I love her more than I love sex, so no I wouldn't divorce in that case.|`|AqLwmafOaa	If you are a woman yes the courts will buy it. If you are a man with that complaint then you will be simply be labeled a monster. Sorry.|`|jUS9ATdMaa	Would his wife let him have a friend with benefits? If not she needs to have sex with him from time to time.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Yes i would divorce over that.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I don't know where in your vows it says that sex is a required part of a marriage. Sex is something you share with your spouse, sex is an emotional connection, it is something that, yes, is important in the relationship, but why do so many people but sex on the top of the requirements for marriage? Sex or lack there of is no reason to get a divorce at all. I understand there are needs that are not being met, but don't you think that there is a reason why they aren't? there are problems that go deeper than sex. She obviously isn't interested in sex anymore for a reason. But either of them want to figure out why.<br>  <br>  Marriage takes work, you can't just give up because things aren't going  your way, after 1 year or 55 years. If you weren't in it for the long haul, you shouldn't have made the commitment to begin with.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	If one spouse wants the physical aspect and the other completely denies them, it is selfish and the spouse should be offended & hurt. <br>  Its quite possibly for him to have a medical/hormonal condition that is causing this than anything else. Before divorcing, he should get checked out by a doctor to be sure there is nothing they can do. Also, they should consider counceling, since they've been together for so long...throwing 20 years away because of something that can be fixed is ridiculous.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I believe that this can be grounds for divorce. Sex is a very important part of a marriage. If he can't get it from his wife then what is he supposed to do?<br>  Although, I wouldn't just rush out and get a divorce. They need to have a serious talk with each other, and maybe get counseling. If they are still in love with each other then this is a problem that can usually be worked out. If not, then what other choice does he have. I don't think that he is being selfish to expect sex from his wife as your wife does. I think his wife is being selfish.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	So you obviously know that sex is more important to some and others..not so much. Before you marry someone who should be with someone whose on the same page if you know what I mean..example: I wouldnt marry someone who didnt think sex was important and I needed it a few times a week. Surely, yes, there are other important aspects of a marriage and after age 40 I'd probably be concentrating on those things more than anything else. With that said I dont know that I'd divorce someone after 20 years and due to lack of sex. The way I see it, you've had plenty of time for sex and other wild stuff in your younger days, now the wife is looking to settle down more. If the husband cant see it that way and is still very interested in the sexual aspect of a relationship than maybe a divorce is for the better, but its something I'd really think through. He should try coming to a resolution with his wife before he makes such a big life-changing decision.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	The problem in my opinion is not sex. You don't wake up after 20 years and don't want to sleep with the person you've been sleeping with all that time.  You just don't! There has to be other problems that they are not talking about. If is about sex, then one of their needs have never been met. Sex was performed out of duty and obligation. It's possible only one person's needs have been being satisfied all this time. And the other is finally speaking up. The sad part is why let it go on so long? When couples talk about what they need sexually from each other and receive it, divorce rates will go down. No pun intended. If two people work at pleasing each other sexually that's one thing they can cross off their list of problems. However, I am willing to bet you your money, it's something else!<br>  <br>  You two should learn something from this scenario. Never have sex without you and your partner being satisfied.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	One of the parts of the marriage ceremony I particularly like is the phrase "With my body, I thee worship."<br>  <br>  Doesn't sound like either of them has been doing much of that.  <br>  <br>  If all he's interested in his "need for just plain sex", then maybe he'd best learn about five-finger exercises, find himself an accommodating knothole, and/or maybe start treating his wife as a woman in need of affection and respect. Divorcing his wife and starting up with a bunch of chippies is an option, if he's willing to tolerate the family upset, as well as the stupidity, expense, and risks to his health.<br>  <br>  If she's using imposed celibacy as some sort of punitive display of resentment, she's hurting herself as much as her husband, and is in serious need of help, and her husband isn't the one to give it. If there are physical problems, she needs to see a physician - yesterday! - and to keep at it until things are in better shape.  If a second opinion seems at all reasonable, don't hesitate. No matter how professional a person may be, they still have their own opinions and prejudices.<br>  <br>  If they have any real commitment to their marriage, they need some counselling hope, soon.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	It's not about the sex at all, there's a deeper issue.  I think she has lost respect for him and maybe she's not being fulfilled, her needs are not being met and she can't give anymore.  Been there, done that.|`|nSbTnLsWaa	IDIOTS its not about sex! There are other issues! If she really wanted to be with him she'd just have sex with him but she let him go, why do you think that is? Cause she lost interest in HIM not SEX. Gee's louise its so obvious.|`|j9DwxVMxaa	NO marriage is not just sex, i hope|`|Sp5TjXqMaa	Usually when one person loses interest in sex (esp women) there is an emotional and/or psychological reasoning for it. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to blame either parties, but with my husband, I have been on both sides of the fence so it does suck all around. <br>  <br>  I DO agree that sometimes one partner has to suck if up and preform his/her husbandly/wifely duties, but often times if there is a chronic "I don't want to" there is a more serious reason behind it and the problem needs to be addressed. <br>  This is a situation where marriage counseling would have helped out immensely because they may have been able to work through their problems.<br>  <br>  As for my opinion on it...<br>  Divorcing because the other partner isn't having sex is a shallow reason. My guess is that there were more things going on to contribute to the problem and little was done to try and figure it out.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	As someone that is in their 40's and married to a man that can no longer perform his 'husbandly duties' all of the time, I'd say it's a bad reason.<br>  <br>  If it were you that could no longer perform, would you consider that a valid reason for your wife to leave?<br>  <br>  I disagree with what your friend is doing, but would also say there must also be a loss of love here and not just sex.  From personal feelings, I can tell you that I still love my husband even when he can't perform.  He's 10 years older, so I expect this problem to get worse over time ????  I will not leave because of it.  I see no difference in his wife and my husband.. other than men expect that a woman should always be able to perform because her only job is to receive... if you know what I mean.  If the sex drive isn't there, then it isn't there... even if all *she* has to do is lay back and 'enjoy' it.|`|hIrdaRdWaa	I think if its a problem for both of them they should attend marriage counseling.  I know allot of people think its cheesy but it can help.  And it might bring out any other undergoing issues that this couple have.  If after attending some sessions it still seems like there it no light at the end of the tunnel then the reason would be irreconcilable differences.  They shouldn't give up thinking that this is a problem that cant be solved unless they try, if they go to file for divorce without the counseling the judge might send them through mediation.  They need to be honest with each other as to why things are not sparking between them.  and be open about what they expect.  Good Luck to them both.|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	It isn't a good reason if you are silly enough to believe that sex is to make babies.  But sex isn't just for making babies.  It is about the emotional bond, shared intimacy, physical connection between two lovers.  <br>  <br>  It sounds as if this guys wife has decided unilaterally to stop providing any physical connection.  It is an emotional blackmail.  This left your friend with 3 options.  <br>  The first was to accept it.  Good for him that he has decided to at a minimum look out for his own well being.  Most studies suggest that this is rarely a successful thing.  The person always gives up.  <br>  <br>  The second option is to file for a divorce.  He has decided that he would rather try a new life.  <br>  <br>  The third option, which people don't like to talk about, would have been a series of affairs that are tolerated by the two people involved.  The emotional love/friendship is there, but the physical love.  So she would turn a blind eye to his affairs and he would preserve her respect not to have it flaunted in front of her.  <br>  <br>  He chose, probably the most mature and healthy response.  Good for him.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes it is a fundamental of a marriage, unless both partners do not want sex
urNgcpiBaa	That's deep...<br>  <br>  I have no idea if I'm good looking.  I have no way of knowing if I don't have someone to camair myself to.  Compaired to all my friends for instance.  My friends have zits and some of them have horribly messed up hair.  I'm zit free and people constantly tell me I have good looking hair.  Im really pale, my friends are tan.  I'm short, my friends are tall.  I'm funny, my friends are funny.  I almost have a 6-pack, my friends are all ripped.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think it depends on the person's taste.  Some girls may like tall and tan men.  Some may like short and pale ones.  Some may like Asian men.  But most of all, personality seems to effect how people view others.  If you have a great personality, it might make you look more attractive to people in person.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	hmm when i looked in the mirror as a little girl and growing up...i never thought of myself as 'unattractive', but i got the opposite feedback from other kids and particularly from my brother (growing up).  <br>  so, i suppose, internally i dont feel attractive. and when Im by myself, i dont really care whether Im attractive or not.   but, as i am attracted to what others might call attractive men and find no real difficulty in that department, i have to conclude that what others see is that I am somewhat attractive physically to others.   <br>  and as I am fairly nerdy I also find that being what others call attractive seems to me to be somewhat of a hindrance to seeing myself as a reflective intelligent person instead of a piece of meat.  hehe|`|OYGGdSLcaa	what i see in the mirror is what i am. i have confidence in myself, whether i look good or not to others doesn't matter, it's a bit egotistical but if you can think to yourself you look good, and show other you think you look good, then others will follow suit. confidence in everything you do is the key to the garden of many paths, you can choose which one to take, but the first thing you must do is open the door.|`|lwXGNizGaa	It's nearly impossible to be objective about your own looks so what you see in the mirror or a photo may not be what someone or everyone else sees.  What you see in yourself is too subject to your emotional state for you to be an accurate judge.<br>  <br>  If you really want to know if you're good-looking you can ask some of your female friends for some objective evaluation (another popular but annoying way of getting this is to post a picture on the internet and ask "Do you think I'm cute/hot/pretty/hunky...etc?" on Y!A)|`|UjRoYNCFaa	The fact is dating sites are usually over populated with males, which means the girls get hit on alot more...and this usually means you have to break the ice by doing or saying something interesting.

I think you should sit down and talk to him about how you feel. It sorta sounds like he's the kind of guy who might cheat on you. So just be careful. good luck.|`|46xuKWyEaa	This reminds me of the song Pina Colada's by Jimmy Buffet.  Honestly I know you love him but he's being kinda a douchebag and idk if he's worth sticking around for, especially if he's going behind your back like this.  I would start hitting on him on myspace and ask if he loves his g/f and see what he says...I'm sorry if things don't go good for you, but you should know instead of living in a lie.|`|4eWvvzE9aa	dammn. that messed up, ask him threw the other account. if he wouldn't mind a bj from u. or somthing sexual. if he says yes. then u need to break up with him and move on cause hes not in love with u no more|`|vzRBqU75aa	Hey hun.<br>  All i can say is if u feel like ur loosing him or he wants to get over u<br>  then he is. all i can say is hold on and hope i'm wrong:(<br>  best of luck to u :D!|`|RwEpGG4caa	look at his actions..reflect on how u feel about him or how does he makes u feel..u will get ur answers....stick to ur principles and dealbreakers..tell him directly what u don't like...if he repeats his mistakes then u shd move on...yes, u love him but do U feel that u r loved back?<br>  <br>  hope this helps
Uj5kuzoJaa	First of all how can you know that you love her unless you've talked to her before. What if she turns out to be a completely different person than what you thought? <br>  If she knows that you like her then why not just try to start a conversation. If she seems like she's interested and doesn't try to get away from you then she's either really nice, or she might like you back. But if you try talking to her and she immediately tries to get away from you, then she's probably not interested in you and it's time to move on. <br>  Just remember when you go up to her that the worst thing she can do is tell you she's not interested. It will hurt, but at least then you'll know that it's time to move on|`|AA10873763	You don't "love" this person - you don't even know her.<br>  She could be a psycho serial killer for all you know.|`|olMVfnljaa	Coming from a girl, lol, girls like guys to come and talk to them. Also it shows you're more confident, and no girl likes a guy who won't talk to them, and ignore them. Go and ask her if she wants to hang out sometime!|`|x7p8JuHxaa	hes right you need to open up. this guy was like in love with me and i knew it but i didnt like him. but out of the blue he called me and we started talking. idk how he got my number. and we ended up being best friends for a couple months. now we are dating and we are very very close. so open up!!|`|qeLikL8Haa	if you don't open up it will never happen|`|xgJbxZgfaa	just ask her if she wants to hangout sometime!|`|1771f0f24b90f964eee831c96eb1a6f6aa	You don't love her, you have what is known as a "crush". If you really cannot bring yourself to talk to her then you have three choices:-<br>  1. Write to her telling her how you feel.<br>  2. Ask a close friend to talk to her for you.<br>  3. Do nothing.<br>  <br>  If you do 1 then there is a risk she will show the letter to other people. (You don't know what she is like as you have never spoken to her).<br>  If you do 2 then she might not respect you as you were too scared to do it yourself.<br>  If you do 3 then you will be no better off.<br>  <br>  I know it is easier said then done but why not ask her out? If she says no then you are no worse off and at least you will know where you stand. Is there a way in which you can find a phone number for her? If you phone her then it will help your shyness as you will not have to look at her and you will keep you self-respect as you have asked her out yourself. Good luck.|`|OYGGdSLcaa	who cares what her friends think or know, the only thing that matters is her right? if she likes you then her friends can either get on board with it or shut up about it. if she doesn't like you, then oh well, it never hurts to try now does it? seriously don't worry about her friends, just worry about her.|`|HXBscLyvaa	how do you even know if you love this girl if you don't know her cuz you never talked to her. how old are you anyway. i think you need to man up and talk to her invite her to dinner or something.|`|SPu5kDX8aa	ask her if she likes snakes. <br>  <br>  trouser snakes....<br>  <br>  <br>  jk jk jk<br>  <br>  talk to her. you dont need to be alone to flirt with a girl and get to know her.<br>  <br>  you can hardly love someone if you do not talk to them|`|vZTV1J2Caa	number one. don't get involved with a girl who only cares what her friends think of you.<br>  number two. you don't love her if you have never spoken to her.<br>  number three. just ask her out, man.<br>  XD|`|NigoVXX1aa	If you are scared to talk then write to her.Sometimes a letter tells more than talking.Try and good luck.|`|1JVAZbt7aa	you. dont. love. her.|`|0EUBc2hRaa	You are in love with this person. Just man up and go ask her to meet you sometime. good luck!|`|wbQU7PIlaa	You're the guy & usually the guy makes the first move. Girls dont. They wait for you to talk to them. Go for it & talk to her. Just randomly start up a conversation if you need to.<br>  <br>  If you want to meet her somewhere, why dont you ask her if she wants to go to the movies or something?|`|9u5A8uriaa	Right you need to be yourself around her. Stay confident or she'll think your not interested! to start a convosation just be like, hey how are you? what you doing on the weekend. just anything like that. Then go on to asking her to meet you. your friends dont need to know just dont tell them about her. goodluck. x|`|IVjwr2gKaa	i've made the same mistake too mate, you have just got to get the courage to talk to her.<br>  <br>  you'll feel much better afterwards.|`|ZeEx9eYeaa	You don't love her, how can you love her if you've never spoken to her!|`|JxRe22Pgaa	ok this what i do. talk to her. tell her u like her. do u like her like her  breannawilliford1@yahoo.com|`|CS9bSThMaa	yu shuld write a note put it in her locker|`|SMxKzQcbaa	just ask her out what have you got to lose?
MexPGL2Qaa	well first you should get to know him and then tell him you like him but let him make the first move.|`|m4YoXNEMaa	Next time you see him ask him out.  Definately a public place.  ie.)  later a couple friends and I are going to so & so to watch the game, shoot pool, play darts, etc.  I'll be up there around __ o'clock if you want to come by.|`|O7inFMXVaa	you could ask a friend to help you in finding out if he like you too<br>  <br>  or maybe, talk to him about other stuff, anything that you can discuss about so that you'll have a chance to know each other|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Let him make the first move.. if he likes you he will.. the feeling may not be mutual.|`|kKG3C103aa	Walk past him...and all of a sudden you trip over a rug and into his arms...What a coincidence =D<br>  <br>  Then tell him u hurt ur hand, if he cant take a look at it and pass u a tissue. Then he'lll have no choice but to hold ur hand.<br>  Thank him by sharing a bottle of champagne in the evening, at your place. =D
AA10874773	well, the best thing you could do for yourself is remain single & not commit to anyone.  that way, you wont feel guilty playing the field, so to speak.|`|AA12041870	You aren't married to any of them, and that lets you be free to do what you want with whom you want.  Don't worry about them.  They will get over it.|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	You haven't messed up your life. Go with the new girl that you like.|`|FQeSo65Haa	If you call that "messing your life up", you obviously have had an easy life (lucky you).<br>  <br>  Just choose one and stay with that girl until you find someone you love.

They will eventually avoid you if you do.|`|AA11452643	My friend, you have no earthly idea of what a messed up life really is. You're dealing in petty teen games rather than real life.|`|QDxjDfSqaa	and youre telling us you messed up your life already?<br>  <br>  what youre going through doesnt event sound like a problem.|`|6VhcygKsaa	It sounds like to me that your not ready to just settle down with one girl.  You need to be honest with the girls and if they cant handle that its on them.  You also need to tell the one that loves you that your just not that into her yet to call it love... If you are not liking her that much then maybe you should not be going out with her.  If she is telling you that she loves you and you don't love her it's going to hurt her more when you tell her that you don't want to see her anymore...  Make sure that you make the girls aware that you are just in the dating mode and not love mode!!!|`|hizUz9rDaa	since your not really into you current gf. end it. no reason why you shouldn't. and go after the new girl
QqY8YgGDaa	Study food and nutrition books and teach it to her ,she will change|`|CqoTqEu6aa	you need to sit her down and tell her it has to shape up or she will be fired. Be a boss about it. it would be unfair to fire her without giving her another chance most workplaces have three warning policy and it doesn't sound like you have sat down with her and had a serious chat yet. Be professional about say "i know we are friends but right now i am speaking to you as a boss. Your behavior has been totally unprofessional and i am formally warning you that if you do not start coming to work on time, and regularly we will have to let you go." <br>  <br>  Give her a chance to shape up or get out. And perhaps let one of your superiors know that you are formally warning her, that way they will know that you are not giving her preferential treatment and that you do respect the rules of your workplace.|`|3wIumdJzaa	You've told her that you were disappointed in her behavior, and she apologized but hasn't changed, which means she really doesn't care. So the next thing to do is fire her. Listen don't ever hire a friend, because it changes the relationship. Unfortunately your friend thinks that because your her friend it's okay to not do what is required of her. She couldn't make it into work because what had a fight with her boyfriend come on. The girl needs to be fired. And to sum it up you feel sorry for her cause she really needs the money isn't it something that your the only one that thinks that. Does she feel sorry for herself no cause you gave her a job and she decides not to show up, she can't function when she has a fight with her boyfriend, but you feel sorry for her come on, don't feel sorry for people who don't' feel sorry for them self it's a waste of time.
oIFMohfUaa	I'm not sure how old you are, but I can say that it sounds like he has tried to "chicken out" of the fight...YOU know it, HE knows it.  <br>  <br>  NO-ONE can FORCE you to fight!  <br>  <br>  Be the bigger man and IGNORE him!  It's way harder than you'd think...but later when you look back, you'll realize that fighting was not worth it!  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if it comes to HIM hitting FIRST...you do have a right to defend yourself!  Just try to finish it quickly without making it look like an absolute a** beating.  Then you just look like a bully!<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|CqoTqEu6aa	wow sorry . . .do you have any contact with reality??? <br>  <br>  fighting is for six year old's in the school yard and even then its wrong and pathetic. If this guy doesn't want to fight you it's probably because all his synapses are firing and he is actually THINKING. <br>  A) it is illegal to fight - if you do beat him up he can have you charged with assult<br>  b) what starts out as a fight sometimes ends up as man slaughter you never know when someone could fall and hit their head just a bit to hard<br>  c) you think your going to have a fist fight what if he decides to have a knife fight or a gun fight? you never know what can happen  . . .<br>  <br>  if you cannot work a problem out with words then walk away. just put the man out of your life, do not fight him! anything could happen and either you or your family might end up regretting your decision to beat his *** for a long long time.<br>  <br>  and as to the comment above if he hits you first run or walk away . . . if the police break up a fight - and both ppl are throwing punches- both men get charged, and if its kids on the school yard they both get suspended. . . ps, if you are teaching your boys its alright to fight then you are fairly deluded to what if another child pulled out a knife?? !|`|fV2SYj60aa	Don't fight unless you can say it's self defense.  Fighting won't solve anything.  If he's being a **** he's just gonna be a **** no matter what, whether you kick his *** or if you don't.|`|hid5HDqfaa	Never, I repeat never resort to your fists unless he takes a swing at you first.
jofuVL9Baa	If your dream girl is going out with your best friend, then she is interested in HIM,  sadly, not you.  Its no body's fault because these things happen and "in love and war all is fair" as long as all the parties involved are single.  What good would it do you if your best friend didn't go out with this lady, if still she is not interested in you?  And, why is it o.k. for other guys to date her, and not your friend?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  If I were you, I wouldn't talk to him about this, as it is all pretty much defined.  It seems to me that this lady is not meant to be more than your friend.  If it is too hard for you, then walk away, both from her and your best friend and open your horizon to other possibilities with other ladies.  You might even have the love of your life closer to you than you think and you haven't even noticed!  I hope this helps and Good Luck!|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	good for your friend<br>  be happy for him|`|AA12077420	tsk!tsk!|`|3zG0HJxSaa	awwwwww. sad well just tell him that you like her and then..........|`|8momYAq4aa	you wasn't for her as a bf, you was her comfort zone. you cheered her up when she was down then she finds another guy quickly. when this don't work out and she comes to you let her no you is not in her zone anymore and hopefully you will have someone.|`|96jdzMmjaa	scalp him and show it to her, it is the only way to gain respect|`|fP1N51MQaa	Yeah who cares what he does... <br>  she's not the only chick in the world<br>  You sound like a really nice guy even id<br>  date you! If he does date her just move on! You're<br>  young! You have you're life ahead of you! This can<br>  be a stupid little drama story you can tell you're kids<br>  when you grow up!|`|zBC6n34Naa	You're both too young to worry about such things.  Focus on your education (especially your grammar, yeesh.)  Besides, in my experience, females don't have a clue until at least twenty five if they're lucky.  She's just not into you, and probably won't ever be, you're just not her type.  Harsh, yes.  Be happy for your bff and keep on lookin'.  <br>  <br>  Ancient Chinese proverb also say... "bro's before ho's."<br>  <br>  (and take it easy on the drinking and partying kiddo)|`|cyytemq5aa	Being that he's your best friend he should already know how you feel about her and the fact that he's still pursueing her, I think is a terrible thing for a best friend to do. That being said, if she's as amazing as you say she is he probably can't help himself. After all he's a teenage boy and we all know sometimes it's not the head that does the thinking when it comes to girls. Talking to him may or may not help, he might not want to pass up this opportunity for himself either. I would think it would be more important for you to talk to her. To tell her how you feel/have felt, yes you'd be putting yourself out there and that's very scarry, but for how long can you be the fall out guy that she turns to in times of need, I would think  that would get real old real fast, to always be second best. Find out what she feels if it's nothing more then friends then decide if you can deal with that, at least you'll know not to be pinning away for something that will never happen. The physical torment that you're putting yourself through is not healthy, do you want to keep feeling that or would it be better to just throw it all out there take what comes and deal with it all at once instead of feeling the pain over and over again! Good Luck!|`|kNtVENanaa	What your friend did was just awful dude. i couldn't imagine what your going through but i know that your hurting really bad. Yes, the best thing to do is to talk to your best friend about how you feel about her(in-case he forgot) , how you feel about them being together. You loved her and apparently she doesn't quite appreciate what you have to offer her. You just want to be there for her and never hurt her. i understand that and in the end she'd going to realize that she missed out on something great......when or if you become part of her past. Only time can tell for sure what's to happen but i know for a fact that i wouldn't be able to forgive either of them. But if you do forgive them and can deal with your dream girl and best friend together than your a better person than me.|`|pS5PhXtiaa	then he is not your best friend|`|TXeUeiPHaa	GOOD LUCK!!!|`|kKG3C103aa	Tell your friend how you feel, then tell her how you feel.<br>  OR<br>  Chase after another girl, and be happy for him.

She's not your possesion, you do not own her. If you're buddy wants to go out with her, well, so what. You're just jealous|`|xsVu6lOEaa	I'm sorry but your friend is wrong. you obviously really like this girl and for him to know that and pursue her is shady... she is also a bit skanky for going after your friend knowing how you felt. they are both your friends and their is a certain code that friends must obey and if they can't obey it then drop both of them. he isn't your best friend and she doesn't deserve your friendship... let them be "happy together" and you move on from both of them. one day you will find someone who loves you as you love them and a best friend who respects your friendship and feelings.

I am 16 & I know that 13 & 16 doesn't seem like a big age difference but it is. 16 year olds & 13 year olds are thinking about completely different things [most of the time]. Truthfully, I do not think you have a chance. Your Mom talking to them will not change your age. If I were you, I would back off. If her father has told you to leave her alone and you don't this could get nasty. If you really love her, wait for her. It'll be worth it in the long run if she really is the one.

If you do Ask permission from her father when she is older. Like 16 to 18 yrs old. You may find love again. Humans are love machines and have the ability to fall in love many times. I quote from a Oblate Franciscan  Monk retreat master. Do not try to sneak around family wishes they only want to protect their daughter. Boys do mature slower than girls. But you are 16. And liable of legal action.

GrwWH5XJaa	Everything happens for a reason. People change so you learn to let go. Things go wrong so you appreciate when things are right. You hear lies to learn to trust yourself and good things fall apart so that better things can fall into place. Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people who treat you right; forget about the ones that don't and just believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said that it would be easy; they just promised that it would be worth it. Maybe the reason we try and hold on to things so tight is because we are scared they'll never come again. Life is about trusting your feelings and taking chances. Losing and finding"|`|xgJbxZgfaa	if u want to be with him then be with him!!!|`|Ds5sow0faa	You have a couple of options here.<br>  <br>  1) Get a rebound (always bad for the guy though). A rebound is someone who you 'use' or 'get with' to get rid of feelings for the past guy.<br>  <br>  2) Get back with your boyfriend and tell him to wait until you're ready. You don't have to do break up with him just because you're not ready. If you're not ready, tell him and he should understand.<br>  <br>  3) Talk it out with your friends and peers. It's always good to say things out loud to other and receive criticism or feedback. If you keep things in, it just stays in your mind and you keep thinking about it.<br>  <br>  4) Get a break-up book. This worked WONDERS for my friend who just broke up with her boyfriend not too long ago who she was OBSESSED about. <br>  <br>  5) Carpe Diem. :)<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't get too  emotional.

Secondly, make sure he isn't already with someone else, and if he is then i would leave him alone because he is probably happy.

QvzkLBa0aa	You're 16, forget about it. You will bounce back eventually. Prison isn't that bad, he might be violated though. But, like you said, he is a Marine, so I think he can take it. Good luck, have fun.|`|GrCj35muaa	He very well could be screwed as far as his career goes. as for prison though, I don't think he will get in as much trouble since you are 16. it also depends on where you live. different states have different laws. look up the general laws in your state online for more info. I do know that being with minors is frowned upon in the Marines and he could get in huge trouble with that.|`|4b303962b3002f4b57b6d57b9f264f3eaa	Depends on where you live.  The laws are different everywhere.  He should be worried about getting dishonorably discharged if it turns out to be illegal.  Hopefully he's smart enough to know.

iMl6aonDaa	If she does have a boyfriend maybe you should just stay away.  You could always go out in a group with other mates as well and see if she talks to you??
DyHpuiR8aa	First of all - this is only my opinion, you shouldn't take it fully to heart, it's your decision.<br>  <br>  Your daughter's still young - she has a lot of nasty puberty stuff to go through, which can be particularly traumatic at the time.  If you throw in that the man she thought was her father is in fact - not - she might find it too much to handle and it could lead into something nasty.<br>  <br>  I think 18 is a good age, as she would have left school by then - maybe taking a gap year before pursuing college or university.  Stress levels will be significantly lower.  Plus, she'll be mature enough to handle any big information.  If she would want to see her father (which I've heard happens often in these situations) she can do, since she'll be an adult.  She'll be old (and wise) enough to make her own decision as to what she should do about it.  Some people would say "fine" and get on with it, since their biological father had no role in their upbringing anyway, therefore shouldn't be allowed in at all.  Some people would be more sensitive and believe that everyone deserves a chance etc.<br>  <br>  Basically - younger people can be erratic & make drastic decisions they may regret.  18 years is old enough, without being too old (if that makes sense)<br>  <br>  Considering your health condition, all I can say is that not all cancers do come back - so there is a chance that you may be fine!  However, I understand your concern, which is why all I can suggest is that you write a letter to her, should the worst happen.  As long as you state that she should only read it when she is ready to handle the information - either write another letter stating this, or trust the letter with your husband and have him tell your daughter that there is something she should know, but she decides when - given that she knows that it will change her life.<br>  <br>  However, I'm sure that all daughers would love to hear as much as they can from their mother - so write as many letters as you like.<br>  <br>  However, this is only if the worst should happen, and I truly hope that it doesn't.  Good luck.|`|ea688e0ee7ebc6fe5eaaffcf5e7e80e2aa	I have experienced something similiar, you willl know when the right time is. Always keep in your head you will have to tell her before someone else does, this is vital. A few weeks after was hell, as we answered the questions, felt the pain etc but 3 years on..life is great and she has a great relationship with the man who raised her and has great respect for him.|`|Y5P7P7eYaa	neber LOL!|`|vyfrNxeOaa	i can understand your ordeal has me and my son's father separated just before i found ou i was pregnant (we were together for 5 years ) but, i think it is to soon, having her father in her live is not gonna bring anything good especially because he has noting to offer apart from shame and bad influence.I would personally would wait until she is a proper adult,she is just getting near her teenager years and teenagers are so dramatic without the drama, that with something like that she may feel hurt and rebel, or worst try a relationship with her father and end up hurt.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|I3CNklLKaa	You tell her the plain unvarnished truth as soon as she's old enough to understand.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	My mother told me when I was 24 that my father wasn't actually my natural father and it was too late.  I believe that she shouldn't have told me at all if she was going to leave it so late.  I have spent a lot of time trying to find him and it has proved impossible.  I now feel that I don't really know who I am.  I would rather have been left with the thought that the father I knew was my father.  You need to either discuss this with your husband and do this before more time passes or make sure that no-one ever tells her.  I don't think you can ever change her birth certificate but you can certainly get a paternity test done if her natural father is willing.  I think a lot hinges on the love she has for the man who brought her up.  If they are close she will undoubtedly be devasted but it is better now than much later.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Sit her down and have a proper chat with her.  Explain that although her dad loves her and will always be her dad he is not her biological father.  Answer any questions she may have and be prepared for the fact she might want to see her real father.  <br>  <br>  You and your husband should do it together.  Good luck x|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	hi there as the truth seems to be very important to you, then tell her the truth.  She may not fully understand everything as children dont always understand the adult world properly at the age of 10.<br>  <br>  One thing I'm not sure about is how to tell her that he dad is a drug user.  What I would ask myself is it really necessary for her to know this one thing about him, at least just yet?<br>  <br>  Her world may come tumbling down so be prepared, I know someone who found out in their 50s that their dad was not their own and it caused him a massive identity crisis. <br>  <br>  Also be prepared that she may want to meet her natural father.  <br>  <br>  Make sure though that she knows the full story of how your husband took her on as his own and has loved her and cared for her like a proper dad. Put a lot of emphasis on this as she will likely feel very vulnerable and insecure. <br>  <br>  It could go lots of different ways so be prepared.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear that you have struggled with cancer and sincerely hope that it does not return and that you have many more healthy years ahead of you.  Be positive.<br>  <br>  All the best x x|`|cKwwt6xZaa	Firstly, tell your husband and make sure he is ok with it. If he's not, don't tell her. If he is, sit her down and tell her that no matter what your husband is always going to love her and be her dad. If you want to tell her, don't leave it too late. Let her know that it's not going to change her relationship with her dad and it is her choice as to whether she actually wants to meet her father. Make sure she has every opportunity open to her and try not to sway her decisions. She may choose to ignore it and go on with her life or she may want to meet him. Just don't pressure her and allow her to make up her mind however hard it may be.<br>  <br>  Also - just as a side note - my father's an idiot and he will never be my dad. My mum's husband is the one that raised me and he will always be my dad. It may help her if you think about it as her having a father and a dad. I don't know if it will but it helps me.|`|jhNUuz0maa	Its your decision. Your husband is not the biological father, but he has been there helping you raise your daughter. I would discuss it with him, but I am sure he will understand the need to tell her and to let her know what kind of father she really has. You don't need to bad mouth the ex, but you can say that the ex has made some poor choices in life and decided not to stay in our lives, but your husband stepped up and decided to fill in where your ex left. <br>  Make sure you daughter understands that your husband will always be a father to her, and she can still call him daddy. Nothing will change, but she should know her daddy is not her real father. <br>  <br>  The trick is when to tell her. I think she is too young to fully understand. If your cancer comes back and the doctors aren't able to get rid of it again, then you are faced with a time crunch. I think if the cancer cells come back and the doctor tells you that you have a certain amount of time, then tell her as soon as you can. With hope and prayer, you won't have to rush into this, and you can tell your daughter when you feel the time is right. In my opinion, I would try to wait until she is at least 12, but ideally 14.
AA10975867	The boutonnieres are part of the floral package paid for by the groom or the couple. The flower is pinned on the LEFT side of his lapel. The corsage for the woman is on her right and the man's is on his left. Florists and wedding planners give one tip to remember: think of a couple dancing. The shoulders are closer on one side as they waltz. The flowers are pinned on the "open" side so they will not be crushed. If the ushers are also standing up with the best man, they have bouttonieres as well. The groom's is usually different.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	the bride and groom pay for the flowers.

And as I said the groom, his best man, ushers, his father, brides father, and the couples grandfathers wear a bouts, as well as the MC.

Drop him, you are not married yet, quit while you are ahead.|`|GAmlREmsaa	Since you are busy studying, he should be able to go out with friends.  Be happy he is home by 8pm!  If you are controlling, he wont be happy.|`|fYv0dtUFaa	packing up and leaving rather than trying to work out the problem seems pretty immature to me...I think you both have some growing up to do before you get married|`|O5KOwhovaa	Leave him.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Yes and no. I understand what it is to be in a demanding program and have a partner who is not only not in school, but also has no clue what sort of stress you're under. It's annoying and you should be able to get space set ground rules ect. However, it's also not fair of you to act a little "holier then thou" just because he's not in school. He's fulfilling his obligations, he chose not to go to grad school, if he wants to go out for a beer with his buddies it's his right to do so. It would be a completely different story if he was a deadbeat or if he was a violent drunk, but he's merely annoying to sober people (most drunk people are)! Make some rules, for instance if he goes out drinking he has to stay out until bedtime. Move somewhere where you can have an office and shut the door. When I was in that situation I did most of my work at the library or a coffee shop, it was not ideal all the time, but you have to compromise. Good luck.|`|L6JUVtGZaa	Well if this is interfering in your life I understand your anger, however, you know he does this, he isn't changing and you don't like it so as far as I can see things you have 2 options....accept it or leave. This is what he likes to do and if its something that you can't deal with.....Remember though, you won't be in school forever so is this something you will be willing to put up with when you're done school? If so then maybe you should live separately until school is done.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	He has a drinking problem and this is already affecting your career and your relationship. If you get married is even going to get worse so i would suggest to get him help and think whether you want to deal with this for the rest of your life if you marry him and have kids. Who knows, one day he can cheat on you b/c he was drunk and he won't even remember and then what?. You are not overreacting, you did the right thing. Think about very well what you want to do b/c like i said this could affect many things in the future.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Why do you find it unacceptable that he goes out with his friends? Is this a constant 7 day a week thing? Or is it a once in awhile thing? If its not an every day things then maybe he's just getting out to be with friends, trying to give you your space. I'm not trying to make excuses for him or be a jerk about the situation. I think maybe you overreacted just a lil bit. I understand you are upset that he goes out. But shouldn't he be able to go with his friends? Does he work? Does he help with the bills? I understand school is rough for you. I think you should just chill let him visit with his friends have a drink or few. And use that time as a way to study for school and get homework done. Good Luck|`|UPhngg5Waa	You are overreacting.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Sounds like he has a drinking problem.  Seriously, I would move on.|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	of course you have the right to be angry! I would be pissed. I mean who want to talk to your fiance, if he's buzzed. Alcohol totally manipulates your real spirit, and if hes coming home practically every night buzzed then i think you have an alcoholic on your hands. Why can't he just have fun with out ethanol? <br>  <br>  You should tell him that things need to change if you want a healthy relationship. things have to work out for the both of you, especially if you plan on marrying him. doesn't h understand the stress your under? I suppose not, if he keeps arguing with you. but hun, this relationship seems in the dumps if you dint have an honest to god serious conversation with him<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|aNIBxQ82aa	unexceptable?  I would suggest you use the word "unacceptable" in this context. (grammar and spelling are important in grad school)<br>  <br>  I don't know if you overreacted. I do wonder if you are letting him distract you. Is your graduate program your priority? What are your goals? Have you discussed your values and what you have in common with him before? <br>  <br>  If his drinking is completly unacceptable to you, and if his behavior is completly distracting to your studies, then I would suggest that one of you moves out asap. Or can you live with it, and just tell him not to bother with you while you are studying. Only you can answer this.<br>  <br>  I was going thought college as an older non traditonal student, grad school and all, while my wife was having an affair. She then put me though a divorce while I was working on my masters program|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	look work can sometimes be overwhelming and all he's doing is having a few beers with the boys and 8 is a decent hour to come home AND hes not doing this everyday.  He's a grown up and as long as he's being responsible about everything and not acting violent or out of contro you shouldn't have a problem, i mean you can talk to him and tell him if he must to limit it but it shouldnt bother you as much as it does....go back home,,,remember that every moment spent mad at each other is a moment of happiness you wont get back,, i feel you as i am a woman myself but you're blowing this a little too much out of proportion|`|kc2WLdlsaa	I don't think anger is the issue. It sounds more like you are disappointed and feel as though he isn't considerate of you and what you are working towards... <br>  <br>  Here's the thing... If he were to stay exactly the same as he is right now - EVERY part of him is that who you really want to be married to the rest of your life? If he does this when you are working and have kids is that what you want? <br>  <br>  I'm not saying to break up but to truly ask yourself what kind of a life and partner you want. If he can be that man willingly without you having to get upset then GREAT! You need to give him the freedom to make his own choices and then observe which choices he makes and how you feel about them. No one likes being told what they can or can not do so he could just be rebelling. Allow him to be himself if that is who you fell in love with because if you are planning on marrying this person you marry all of him, the good and the bad. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kbz5S3waaa	if he's drinking every night then you need to get him help, this is called alcoholism...|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	I don't think he is really a fiance. If after 5 years you are not married you are just a live in girlfriend. So, put out of your mind any great ideas of marriage and learn to tune him out. You may need to stay for financial reasons now, but if you were to marry him you'll end up in a divorce. His priorities are much different than yours, so tune him out or dump him and finnish your education.<br>  I am sure you know the old saying "There are plenty fish in the sea" and you can do much better than him.|`|GvamTVqAaa	He's not asking you to quit doing what you're doing and he's not willing to stop doing what he's doing.  So your choices are either deal with this for the rest of your life or move on.|`|J4W68owgaa	You're overreacting sweetie. You said yourself, he isn't in the same demanding school set-up you are, so why should he have to live like he is? You guys need to come to some sort of agreement where a few nights a week, he's home, spending time with you so you can enjoy a sober guy, but a few nights he can go out with the boys and have some fun.<br>  <br>  It's not fair to expect him to stop everything because YOU have a demanding load, on the other hand, it's not fair for him not to be sober and spend time with you as well.<br>  <br>  There is a happy medium that can be reached here sweetie, you just have to find it. You need to go back home and work this all out.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Disclaimer: I accidentally got involved with an alcoholic.<br>  <br>  I don't think you're overreacting. You seem to find intoxication unacceptable, and you seem to be headed somewhere serious with your life. He, on the other hand, seems to enjoy drunkenness, and lies to you about it.<br>  <br>  No one has to agree with your opinion. You can make this decision all on your own. It's ok with you or it's not. He doesn't agree and that's fine. You don't have to stay with him if you disagree on such a fundamental matter.<br>  <br>  I wish I'd left the alcoholic I lived with the first time his drinking was unacceptable to me.  Instead I stayed for five years. I tried to have a normal life while he imploded beside me, and took me down with him. My transcript took a turn for the worse after he moved in.<br>  <br>  You are not overreacting. Good luck.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Look, you both have rights here.  He has the right to be treated as an adult so long as he's drinking responsibly and not hurting anyone.  You have a right to be left in peace to study.<br>  <br>  However, I sense he's not respecting your wishes as he's lied about drinking, now, and he continues to do it even though you've expressly asked him to stop.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you aren't respecting his rights; you're in college but that doesn't make you better than him.  Why are his wishes subordinate to your own?<br>  <br>  I think you should sit down and talk it out; try to come to an accord.  If you can't compromise on this, then your relationship is doomed.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10886262	it's not that you are over-reacting or justified; the two of you have different priorities in life.....yours are your studies and your future - working hard to obtain your education and subsequently a great job and future and  his are his buddies and having fun - immediate gratification; I can tell you if you do marry him, the differences in your priorities will only grow wider and you will end up divorced and you will end up paying HIM alimony cause you will be making more money.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Sorry tio tell you but your definetly over doing it. He he comes home that way why not jsut go into a diffrent room t ostudy. he needs to be able to enjoy life and it was your choice to live toether why taking on so much in school.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	It is a bad sign that when he texted you he was telling you that you overreacted, rather than apologizing to you.  This is the kind of self-centered, "it's all about me" boy who is NOT marriage material.  He needs to grow up.|`|GyrG1roTaa	i think youre overreacting|`|2I5XqMDzaa	ur overreacting. i mean thats who he is if u dont like it leave|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	You need to take a step back. Are you his fiance or his mother. I can see if he was going out every night with the guys and ignoring you, but it's only 1 day a week. The only issue you seem to have with it is that it's not on a day of your choosing. That sounds a bit ridiculous if you ask me. So they get together on a Monday instead of a Saturday. Would he be any less buzzed or any more cognizant if he waited until Saturday to drink? Let the man go out with his friends on whatever days suits him. Just don't try to hold any intellectual conversations on those days or discuss anything important. It's bad enough you left, but now you expect him to come crawling back begging for your forgiveness when he really didn't do anything wrong. You want to marry this man and you are making an issue out of something that really is such a non issue. Is this how you are going to act every time he doesn't do things your way? If it is, then you better rethink the whole marriage thing...|`|Czpfs8RLaa	try making a deal with him like 1 day or 2 days a week he can go out with friends but you pick him up so that he will not drive drunk, work it out so that you are both agreeing on the issue, sometimes guys just need to hang out with thier "buddies" but if he did not do it every night that would be better and on the nights he does then you would know to expect it, and call him, tell him that you both need to communicate without anyone saying thing like "your overreacting" or "thats a dumb idea" no hurtful words just simple communication|`|cGbTJobeaa	It doesn't matter if you overreacted or not.  You both need to be close to 100% in agreement on core issues. On this issue you are not compatible and your fiance is not willing to find a compromise position.  This should be a non-issue because it is so easy to find a workable solution.  If he cannot work with you to find a solution on something like this, how are you going to resolve conflict for the really big things in your marriage?<br>  <br>  It does not matter if everyone else thinks it is ok to go out for a few drinks after work during the work week.  No one else lives in your home; they do not get a vote in how your home is run. You should not have to compromise your standards in your own home.<br>  <br>  Either your fiance is willing to find a compromise solution that works for both of you, or he is not. Let's say the compromise is that he can stay out 3 hours but only have 1 beer.  So...he gets to go out, be social, have a drink while you're studying. And you have someone who is 100% there when you are done studying for the night.  Right now, he's the one having the hissy fit and being immature.  "I don't care if my drinking during the week upsets you!! I'm going to have a few drinks. I'd rather argue with you about it than respect your opinion and find a solution that both of us can accept!"
wRHhpanmaa	lol I met my husband the day i turned 17, and knew by the end of the night that he was the man i wanted to be with the rest of my life. I was really nervous when telling my parents,( i expected the worst possible reaction) but my dad was actually calm about it and very understanding. I just stood there with my mouth open in awe. lol. you should broach the subject with them, without actually telling them, and find out what their reaction is. If they react negatively, than elope, but if they consider your feelings, and are supportive, then tell them of your decision. You want your parents there the say you get married, end of story. Just tell them that whether they agree or not, you will be getting married. My husband and i knew each other a total of 3 months before getting married. lol. Like you said, no point in postponing the inevitable. When you know you are in love, you know.|`|ZpA0Rgogaa	it's your choice whether uu want to get married faster or what.. about your family..in my opinion, u should tell them about your dream to get marry with your beloved bf..it's not fair 4 them if u juz ignore them like that..they supposed to know this thing..they was ur family..they must be love u so much..i'm sure u don't want to hurt them..i know u love your family so much..be brave..if you feel that what you want to do  is right,DO IT!!don't be scare..just tell your family the truth...|`|dFUqPcWKaa	On one hand, you could tell your family out of respect, knowing that they will more than likely want to attend any type of wedding ceremony. But, chances are, they won't approve (because they very rarely do).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you could just do it and not tell anyone until after. Doesn't really give them an option to attend the ceremonies, but it saves you both the pain of hearing how you're "not ready to take such a big step".<br>  <br>  I'd say option number two. It worked for me.|`|krQiDGCHaa	You just tell them, what's the big deal?<br>  <br>  If you love this man so much and are going to marry him no matter what, then what does it matter what your parents think?  Sure, I can understand you wanting them to approve and be happy for you, but answer this -- does it make a difference if they don't approve and aren't happy for you?<br>  <br>  If your answer is "yes" then you probably aren't ready to get married anyway.  When you marry, your spouse should be the single most important person in the world to you.  If you're going to make a decision to marry or not marry based on your family, then you're not with the right person.  He needs to be your everything once those vows are said, so make your decision based on the wants and needs of the two of you, and not everyone else.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD ON:  Good for you! :)  i would have married my husband whether my parents approved or not as well, because I love him more than anything in this world.  I can definitely understand where you're coming from though , saying it would be ideal if they were on board -- of course it would!  I really do wish you luck, please let me know how it goes!  And congratulations!|`|VAI6MtPIaa	Your family will be concerned with the quickness of your decision. Don't ask for their opinion but they will give it to you once you tell them. The best way I would handle the situation is have a family dinner of some sort and have the guy ask you in front of all of your family. You say.. "Yes" and then start preparing the wedding. They'll be less shocked by the reality of seeing him ask you to be his wife than coming back to them saying that you are getting married to him. There doesn't need to be an engagement ring either, not unless its what you both want. <br>  <br>  <br>  My only other advise would be to wait at least 6 months before deciding on getting married. My recent bf and I were together for 3 months and planning to move in together and get married and a lot of other stuff. We broke up because the reality started to kick in and in the end we weren't very compatible (we were but in other ways we weren't). Things can be perfect for a while ... then all of a sudden you start seeing more and more of this person and they might not be who you thought they were at the beginning of the relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, I do have a question. What if you learned that he molsted a child 8 years ago or that he abused one of his ex gf's enough to put her in the hospital? What if you start learning all of these things about his past and you are all ready married to him... scared for your life? My parents have been married for almost 35 years and they still learn new things about each other.|`|5r48jn7iaa	i agree, why wait you know you love each other. but they will think its to soon, but doesn't it only really matter how you two feel?? its like when people say that 20 year olds should wait till they're 25, that's just wasting 5 years of a good marriage.|`|e8bf4cd0733c71e8557b69243c277c8eaa	as long as both of you are sure this is what you want go for it. just be honest with your family and consider letting him at least putting an engagement ring on your finger.|`|xgvPCQXsaa	That true if your family with you yea but forget the friends cause family will alway be around.|`|xGshAiXOaa	You will regret it if your family is not a part of what should be a joyous moment in your life.  Your family will too, believe me.  My father still holds a great deal of resentment towards me, my husband, and my marriage because we did not offer him the chance to be there to give me away.  He said he wouldn't have approved, but that he still would have been there to support me and witness that moment in my life.
f4126b0baa297b82a91a07ad7af89bd0aa	it depends on the situation you are in, the living conditions, etc.<br>  <br>  Its sadly not your choice. If your mother wants to give him custody, it would be easier, they have to see if he has suitable living conditions for you.<br>  <br>  Other then that, are you ready to move into someone you barely know (assuming the past year u have been in touch with him). Its a total life style change when you move in with someone new, there will be new rules nad boundaries, maybe favorable at first, or worse... are you ready to really depart with your mother, is it realy that bad for you?? there is alot more to it when it starts happening :)|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	What do you mean? Now that you can't get along with your mom, you want to get out and be with your dad now. I've heard that so many times and every time it ends up going sour when the move is made. <br>         Your dad doesn't want you after he hasn't made an effort to see you in 15 years. Can't you get it? Now you want to act like a child and for the last couple of your years at home you want to leave because you think the grass is greener on the other side. You have a surprise coming.  The best thing you could do is to stay at home and finish your HS education and then think about going out on your own.|`|MWfWPunqaa	Say what, Im 16 too... Well, PRAY. Dear, if you keep on praying, I am very sure that God will shows a sign that you really need in your life. Remember, good or bad, he is still and always be your dad. Don't be frown always k, enjoy your life and be who you are! XoXo ^,^
6mLQvA7iaa	Eh... just ignore them.  They're immature and they're sore that they can't get a piece of *** their own age.  <br>  <br>  I get hit on in my tennis skirt.  Guys just do it.  Ignore it.  You're better than that.|`|U1I2vEM9aa	Your best bet is to ignore them.  Don't even look up or acknowledge that they even exist.  Guys that don't know better are so disrespectful nowadays and will do ANYTHING to get a girl's attention because they can't get it any other way.  They are sad, really!  (o:   I wouldn't flip the bird, because you never know who the guys are, and it can set them off and you could end up getting hurt.   You could think that is silly, but times are different now.  You do the wrong thing to the wrong person and they can snap.  Be careful.  Better to ignore them, that makes them even more crazy!  They want you to react, but don't play their game and stoop to their stupid levels!  Watch what you wear, but mostly just ignore them and don't make eye contact!!

NtSQcyHLaa	If you truly like her and want the relationship to work out, then it shouldn't matter. That "baggage" can be left at the door if you really care for her. But if you have any doubts, then do not do it. You could really hurt the girl if you mess it up, and she's already depressed so a failed relationship is only going to push her down further. So if you don't want to go out with her, then just stay with her and be the best friend that you can be, because that's what she really needs right now. (PS, My answer for everything relationship-related is prayer. It really helps.)|`|6Tj70Xv5aa	Honestly, no. I wouldn't mind having to cheer my girlfriend up once in a while, it's something I would probably enjoy doing actually.

sGP6s7uraa	You do what you can afford.  I usually get something for the shower off the registry and then get a card with best wishes for the wedding.  If I don't attend the shower, I bring a gift to the wedding.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Yes, if you are invited to both the bridal shower and the wedding, you are supposed to bring a gift with each, but the shower gift can be a lot smaller and less expensive than the wedding gift.  Most people go off of the couple's bridal registry to select a gift for the shower, and then lots of times they give a cash gift as their actual wedding present.  Look at her registry and see what you might like to get her.  Depending on your budget and how close of a friend the bride is, I would suggest getting her a small kitchen appliance like a toaster or a blender for the shower, and then getting something else that is a bit more expensive off the registry, like a bedding set or flatware, for the wedding gift.  I personally feel sort of awkward about receiving cash gifts from friends who are my peers.  I have no problem with cash gifts from relatives or family friends who are my mom's age, but I'd feel strange if my friend from college handed me a $100 bill, you know?<br>  <br>  Also, I forgot to mention this, but if you are going to the wedding with a date (like your BF or husband or whatever), it is perfectly reasonable to expect him/her to pay for half of the wedding gift, since he/she is a guest too.  It's also always OK for a group of friends to chip in together on one slightly expensive gift, like a really nice mixer or an area rug for the living room, so if you have limited funds, this might be a nice way to still give your friend a quality gift without breaking the bank.|`|Xa2HfiL9aa	You can get one for the bridal shower and another for the wedding, i always bring one for each event but its not required, someone gave me this for my bridal shower and i couldnt have been more greatful..plus i think its affordable|`|GvamTVqAaa	You only have to give 1 gift.  If you go to the shower bring it then, if not then just bring it to the wedding.<br>  <br>  Get her something off their registry.  You can't go wrong because they obviously want/need it!|`|ypuvatS2aa	k im 14 i know alot! u should buy things 4 her that she will need in the house such as pans, pots, towls, bowls, plates, and any other things u see around the house! remember dont be cheap i live in a house that is beautiful and im never cheap even in cloths! soo good luck:)<br>  <br>  try going to the mall take her with u and what ever she sees that she would like for the house buy it 4 her. but dont tell her just say that ur looking at stuff 4 ur house!!!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	generally you buy a gift off the registry for the shower, because she'll be opening it in front of everyone at the shower.  for the wedding just get her a gift card to the store where she's registered, that way you don't have to haul a big gift to the wedding wtih you when your'e all dressed up, and she can buy whatever's left on her registry after the wedding.|`|AA10975867	If you are invited to a shower, you take a gift, usually a kitcheny thing or bath towels, etc. Then for the wedding you give them something more substantial. If she is registered you don't need ideas from us. go to her registry, buy her one smaller item, like around $20-$25 and for the wedding something bigger. Sometimes people see that a bride has registered for bedding and they buy perhaps a beautiful pillow for the bed and then sheets sets or a blanket for the wedding. Or, I often buy a bath mat for the shower and then huge bath sheets and matching towels, face cloths for the wedding to match. If you do use her registry, be sure you tell them at cash register so they take the items off the registry.
tZUSVuUvaa	True sometimes but not always. It's not always about competition over men either - very beautiful women get advantages that those of us who are pretty or average don't in many areas, not just relationships. There are a lot of women who are always cutting down anyone that they think might be even remotely attractive though, due to their own insecurity. We aren't all like that. It really irritates me when women act like that towards each other.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Still false for me (just like the last time you asked).  I don't go around worrying about how other women look.  There will always be someone more beautiful and I see no reason to make this a problem for me.<br>  <br>  No man is going to put up with me based on my appearance alone, anyway.  I'm way too complex.  lol|`|krQiDGCHaa	I can't really speak for other women, but I'm not jealous of beautiful women because I view them as competition.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't want to be with anyone who would see me standing next to someone else and choose which of us they wanted to be in a relationship with based on looks alone.  That is shallow, and not the type of quality I would want in a boyfriend or husband.<br>  <br>  I do know that looks are at least a little important because you do need to be attracted to someone, and because of that I work hard to take care of myself and look good.  At the same time, that is not what I want to be judged on.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	FALSE!!!! The REAL reason is because they are insecure with themselves. They think they are less then next to a pretty person because they don't feel good about themselves. OH by the way>>>MEN do this too. So if you think they don't, then your a FOOL!!! Not only woman are insecure with their looks???? But NO I would have to disagree with you on this one. It's all about how secure you feel about yourself!!! It's really not about looks??? Baeuty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	No, I'm married and not looking to compete in the dating world. I get jealous when I see a hot girl though. I'll be like "damn, I wish I had that _______ (body part/hair/style/etc)". I'm not mean about it, just envious. Sometimes I'll even compliment =]|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	When I feel jealous of a cute girl, I am not usually thinking of men. I am usually thinking that I wish I had her long legs or her pretty hair or smooth skin. I am not ugly by any means, but I compare myself to most girls.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I don't think being "pretty" in and of itself is the trigger.  I've seen many attractive woman get a long well with other attractive, average & not so attractive women at work, clubs, gyms etc.  <br>  <br>  I think it is the combination of being "pretty", flirty, and dressing in a manner designed to draw male attention that brings forth the jealous behavior and think they're in a competition.  In a way, the attractive woman that flirts / dresses in revealing non-conservative type clothing IS putting out singles (to men & woman).  In that case, other women will indeed think it is a competition (especially if there is a guy they are attracted to / have an interest in).<br>  <br>  Now when the woman is happy in another relationship and has no interest in another guy at work, the gym etc. and the pretty attractive girl arrives, she often isn't threatened at all..even if she is being flirty, dressing in a flaunting manner (though they might think she is in general a skank or trying WAY to hard and laughing behind her back).  It's not being jealous, just amusement.|`|3iNobwVraa	Well, I'm not going to answer for 'most women', but I will say for myself, and the women I know (family and friends) that would be a big False.  Do we sometimes joke around with each other, (ugh you're such a B, your hair is so gorgeous) definitely, but it is just a teasing way of complimenting one another.  And, we all appreciate beauty wherever we see it.  As far as competition for men, nah, sorry.  That's a WAY outdated perspective.  The women I know are not the type to compete for a man.  (which is to say, they are emotionally older than 15, and are not shallow!!)<br>  <br>  Next stereotype?  Come on, pitch it to me, this one was too easy!  Curve ball anyone? :)|`|Yby3loNEaa	well it is true and it is false, i find women Beautiful, all shapes and sizes it is the way you carry yourself. i think i'm pretty, and i notice pretty girls all the time and i don't sit there and think oh my god she is better looking then me i hate her!!!!!!! no if you are like that i feel sorry for you there will always be someone that looks better, i really think women would rule this earth over man any day but we are fighting over men and they are enjoying it every chance they get i mean women are fighting eachother for one guy that is lying to them both and the girls want to fight eachother are you kidding me. Girls are judgemental towards each other if we came together we would have guys were we want them and they will be stuck. but that will never happen because women have a problem with other women looking good|`|xGshAiXOaa	False.  Pretty has little to do when it comes to getting quality men who are interested in more than just looks.  I'm no dog, but I'm also not a bimbo that only relies on my body to reel them in.  Beauty is temporary.|`|xgvPCQXsaa	Yea that true way some people is jealous type.|`|fVPIP5dgaa	True, they want what they cant have.
imEV2iKGaa	How is your relationship with these friends? Are you all getting along? these are the questions you have to ask yourself. But i supposed you are getting along with them if you initiatively sat beside them without them inviting you.<br>  Well, did they tell you why you leave, if not i supposed you may have interrupted their discussions. They may be discussing something that they did not want you to hear, i mean they need privacy. They did not reject you sitting with them cause well  if u had asked them, i dont think they will reject as an act of politeness.
XIuQyB7oaa	Older teenagers tend to do pretty much what they want and it's usually because they want to be seen as grown ups. Punishing your kids by taking away their privileges at this age is probably unproductive as you found out. My only suggestion is that you probably tell them that you will treat them like adults when they start behaving like adults, until then, you'll carry on treating them like little kids.<br>  <br>  Ask them if they want to be treated like adults and also tell them that if they want to be treated like adults they should learn to respect people and situations and then they will get the respect they actually want and people will start to treat them as adults too.<br>  <br>  Just explain to them that they are making a viciouscircle for themselves. I realize you want them to do well at school, but that will sort itself out when you've sorted out how they perceive other people and situations.<br>  <br>  I do hope that you can sort out the problem. I would love to hear how you get on.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	you did this for 2 and a half years and it wasn't working. why did you keep doing it?  don't punish a kid for a bad report card, find out why and then try and fix it. obviously the wrong approach to your problem has created the nightmare you're living in.  when your mean 17 year old reaches 18, kick him out of the house.|`|ZodtrOtCaa	after awhile they get use to us taking privileges away it gets old. my daughter whos in 8th grade gives me problems here and there. You should go with him and sit and talk to his high school counselor see whats going on tell him your doing it for his own good to have a good life friends will come and go you'll go through education one time in your life don't waste it. I know sometimes friends lead them in the wrong route Good Luck.
zjxr6fRsaa	lol, that'd be funny, but i think u should know "your sister" better than us (since we don't know her) and don't u think she'll probably tear it up right away...because  of all you've done to her?..just saying.......|`|5qrhGlgJaa	Depends how old she is, if not you can give it to me, lol|`|Q5tSMKQfaa	i think it would be funny as hell but a calender is really a dumb birthday present|`|ZodtrOtCaa	a picture of you on calender for a sister aaahhhhhhhh i think it's a bad idea.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Get her better gift.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't understand why a statistic makes you feel bad.  If you read a statistic that said that 22% of people prefer to buy blue cars, would you be saying, "They make it seem like we are just a group of blue car lovers taking up precious space."?  A stat is just a stat.  It is not a judgment.  I don't think the stat made you feel bad - I think you already feel bad about not being married.  You should seriously try being less hard on yourself, though, Britney!|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	I have to disagree over the single men not having the same stigma especially when it concerns age. I think it is worse for men if they are older to never have been married cause they are stigmatized that something is wrong for why they are single not that its a choice. Now when I see a woman that is single that is older say, 35 or older without kids thats never been married you think she is independent now if she has kids and never been married you think she is irresponsible and if she has kids and been married before you assume her husband cheated or something happened for why theyre divorced. Aside from all this though **** happends really so you could skeptisize all day over what people think of what but I think that it comes down to what you want. Do you want to obsess over statistics and why marriages don't work and what people might think of you if you stayed single? I sure wouldn't thats sounds just as miserable as a failing marriage. I think you should just do what makes you happy and not worry what people think or worry about a statistic.|`|gwrrkYV3aa	I don't really know how to answer you but I agree with everything you said lol.|`|xgvPCQXsaa	You know that just way people think people need stop think about stuff like that I think.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, you make some very good points. Why would an
WbZ0LbQ9aa	she is not happy now and never will be. her marriage was built on the wrong reasons. sounds like she loves you. the shock of her possibly not being able to have kids made her make some rash decisions. it sounds like she's regretting it.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I hope she can be happy but somehow sense, that she won't. She seems to have big time self esteem issues that she has to deal with. It's sad and pathetic, how she has handled herself and you. It's like those people who divorce and immediately start dating, without allowing themselves to have a clear picture of what just happened. In order to be happy in a new relationship, you have to have had the possibility to heal first from your previous love. Common sense ! <br>  Your ex, is confused but she has chosen her battles unwisely. You should move on and wish her the best.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Probably not...but it sounds like you dodged the bullet on this one. Marrying and having a baby quickly simply because she thought she would have to get pregnant fast is the second dumbest reason to marry.<br>  <br>  She let the news melt your relationship...and her marriage is now contingent on her having a child. If she can't, shell leave him and try to find another "sperm donor"...but if she can't have a baby no one will ever make her happy.<br>  <br>  And that is trouble you don't need.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7937ad765fa4fb5c3d072fbc563e1127aa	Sounds to me like your ex only thinks of herself, so the answer is, she will never be happy, with her hubby, you, or anyone.... just cut the strings, & get on with finding your happiness hun, cos she will mess with your head big time.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|5V2VClqQaa	I hope she will. She relates marriage with love, and you failed to show your love in her aspect. Sad, isn't it?|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Who knows! The only thing I can tell you that a birth is not what makes a marriage. Marriage is about two people learning how to live together. A baby grows up into an adult and will eventually leave you. Yes, it is true that a good marriage and a caring mother shelters a child and is absolutely essential to the child's well being.<br>  <br>  But it is essentially the parents and how well they function together that will show by example what a good marriage is all about. Yes, marriage is not solely for making babies. Check out my source for more info on relationships.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You are asking a question that cannot be answered by anyone, not even your exwife. I think you are really asking is there any chance you two will get back together.........another question that cannot be answered. You are  torturing yourself with this kind of thinking and by communicating with her. There are choices she could make, stay in her marriage or leave her husband to come back to you. It sounds like she will eventually leave her present husband but it may not be to you but to another man who she thinks could make her pregnant. This obsession  either having a baby has  evidently lead her to a ridiculous length. If the problem with pregnancy is with her and not the man  switching partners probably makes no difference. As long as this obsession lasts I don't think getting back with you would solve it. You should encourage her to get some therapy so she can learn to see, think and act rationally.|`|eZ4qfnSQaa	She could be happy if you let her end the situation between you to.  If you love her then allow her  to work on her marriage…you all need to honor her decision.  I know it hurts and it is going to be hard but you missed the boat.  Let her live with the choice she made.|`|GU4S78ejaa	She might be happy, if she allows herself to. She should probably stop calling you & try to get over you! I get why she did that. She was scared! Most females, their main goal in life is to be married & have babies. I wish you both happiness in whatever it is!|`|KEUFaCkUaa	you should be on your knees thanking your lucky stars you didn't marry that whack job.|`|5brlJBGRaa	I do not think that the marriage will work out if she still has feelings like that for you. I think in your case if you really loved her and knew you wanted to be with her and she was scared of not have kids or getting married then you should have givin her one or the other and promised her down the road then you would do the other. It would have made her stay I mean if you really loved her then what is so wrong with marrying the girl?|`|AA10353286	The answer is:<br>  <br>  Most married people will not be happy with their marriage at some point. So much so that 50% of all married people will actually get a divorce, and the other 50% who stay married, cheat, lie, pop Zoloft, and generally stay miserable because they don't know what else to do or how to get out of the knot they are tied into. It sux, but that's reality. Few "stay marrieds" stay happily married. So there is a HUGE glimmer of hope for you, maybe.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, she is married right now. So leave her alone right now. If and when(which is more like it), she does eventually get divorced, maybe you'll still want her, be available, and have no children yourself. Maybe not. Only time will tell, but at least give it that.<br>  <br>  Also, having children is a liability and a major responsibility. It's not fun and games all the time(or even most of the time). It's taking care of another human being. It's constantly being asking of. It's giving without getting much in return. It's also expensive. Children are great, but I discourage having children just as much as getting married. Both can be wonderful, but for most people, neither are. Just Google difficult parenting, difficult marriage. Seriously. Neither is a fairy tale. You have to be realistic about things if you want to be happy.

Otherwise, they wouldn't get to say 'all guys are jerks.'|`|AA12159712	Just because a guy goes out with a girl doesn't mean he can't see other girls. It takes a meeting of the minds of both that they are in a committed relationship to each other, exclusive to them alone.

AA11286455	What to do?<br>  <br>  Allay has the right idea.  It's important to explore, meet new people, make new friends, discover more of yourself--what other talents and skills do you have BESIDES being good at waiting around and BESIDES just being your bf's gf???<br>  <br>  What instrument did you always want to learn to play?  Did you ever dream of being a stand up comic?  Ready to conquer your fear and hit the ski slopes?  <br>  <br>  Interested in being a candy striper and helping someone else, focusing on someone else--except you and how life-less your life is or how dead your life is when HE'S not around to focus on YOU?<br>  <br>  Sometimes, life doesn't GET interesting and you are not personally interesting (or interested) until and unless you MAKE it/yourself interesting.  <br>  <br>  For girls and young women, I think its vital to "get to know you" and to develop your personality and value system OUT of a guy's "orbit".  Elsewise, his life overshadows yours and you become boring...even to yourself.  <br>  <br>  Because you have no real life of your own, are constantly dependent on him socially and emotionally, you can get clingy and still find yourself (essentially) alone--even though you're "with HIM".  <br>  <br>  Life doesn't necessarily improve bc you've got a bf.  Nor does it while you wait around for him to give you attention, to give your life meaning.  It just means you're wasting your life.  You're wasting you.  <br>  <br>  This is an age-old problem for women.  It's up to you to change it for  yourself...and your daughters.  <br>  <br>  Get Busy.  You've got places to go, things to do, thoughts to think, experiences to treasure, personal challenges to conquer, AND people to meet!|`|gErOzwQWaa	Try going out more. Explore your city and look for places you might enjoy. Try making new friends online. I could talk to you if you need someone to talk too.

AA11693263	Well, I am involved in a situation just like yours except I am the Mom of the girl who's boyfriend we don't like. She started dating him when she was 16 and from the very start there were nothing but problems with the both of them. She is now 18 and our relationship has mended from all of the heartache that they have both caused but she did move in with him. I am doing my best to accept her decision but if her boyfriend had not had the same thoughts as you, it would have saved her a lot of heartache too. My thoughts are that if YOU really love her it would be important to you to earn her parents trust and respect. If you do that then your relationship will be easier on the both of you. It is really hard for a girl to be in love with a guy that her parents don't trust/respect. It causes so much strain on all sides. My daughters boyfriend treats her harshly, bosses her around, deals and does drugs, and has no problem with the fact that we have no respect for him. <br>  You have to try to put yourself in her parents places. It is very hard to let your child go in the first place and it's even harder if it is to someone who we think isn't quite the right one for her. This has been one of the hardest things I have ever had to go through in my life and if her boyfriend would just understand that I only want what is best for my child and to show me that that is what he wants too then I could handle their relationship better. Ask yourself truthfully, have you done things/said things to her that would upset you if someone did them to your daughter/mother/sister? If the answer is honestly yes, then if you truly care about her, stop doing those things. Like I said, respect her, show her parents you respect her. Ask them what you need to do to earn their trust. Tell them you know that you have made mistakes in the past with her but you are growing up/maturing and you want to prove to them that you are going to treat their daughter well and love her like they think she deserves to be loved. Its just a matter of they love this girl more than you could know right now and they need to feel secure in the fact that you are going to love her that much too. If you do love her that much you will do anything you need to do to have a good relationship with her family so that she can continue to have a good relationship with her family. That is very important to a girl. She will love her boyfriend/husband with all that she is and will give up everyone and everything for him if she has to but she would rather not have to. She will be a much happier person in the long run if she can have you and her family, too.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Since she 17 and the in laws are out laws.

If she did, obviously she would still see you no matter what her parents say. I suggest you find a girl who is more into you. It will be much more satisfying.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sounds to me like her parents are trying to protect her.<br>  <br>   Maybe they don't think she is ready for anything serious yet ( and they are right!) or maybe they feel that you are not mature enough to handle a proper relationship... and you might hurt their daughter.<br>  <br>  Besides, she is a minor and she lives under their roof. That means she must obey the rules they set in their household. A person can decide how to live his or her life when they are older and financially independant...and this is not the case here.<br>  <br>  So...She should stay home, obey her parents, and decide if she wants to see you or not. You should try to see you cannot control things....and you should try to see things from a different perspective as well.<br>  <br>  You are still very young. You have your entire life ahead of you. Take it easy and focus on studying and on getting prepared. Life is not easy and it is not fair, either.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	or. or. or. she's 17 and is finally noticing you are kind of a chump and seeing that her folks are right about you.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i see why her parents hate you...  i'm shivering cuz you might delete this answer...    lol.|`|9hkcBmzAaa	well do not take this ignorantly but it is kind of mean for you to sit there and say she should just disregard her parents rules. If she were to do that than they would probably not want anything to do with her. SHe kind of seems a lot like me on that way because when it comes to my parents if they do not like my boyfriend than i wont be with him. They have to give me a reason they cant jsut say i dont like him but i trust my parents and i know they know whats right for me. Now instead of going about this a bad way if you really love her or like her or whatever and what to spend your life with her than maybe you should try getting along with her parents. Even if they are difficult. If you go out of your way to show them what a great guy you truley are than they will like you. maybe you just did something that they didnt agree with and now they dont trust you and think your bad for her but if you show them differantly than you all can be happy. I understand how you feel because you think that if she really loved you and wanted to be with you she would do anything but also you have to see her point of view as well. and im sure she does love you or whatever and by doing this for her she is going to love you that much more.<br>  again do not take any of that ignorantly i was not trying to be mean. <br>  I wish the best of luck to you and i hope everything works out between your guys. :]|`|AA11865280	If she lives with her parents and under their roof then at least for the moment she has to abide by their rules. One of the solutions to your problem is that once she is able to get out from under her parents and be on her own then she will be able to make decisions independent of her parents which may mean if she is working now to at least save some $ to get her own place or when she goes to college. The issue is living with her parents and being dependent upon them and her not being the age of an adult. It may not be the wisest course to take for her to rebel against her parents, but she can in a respectful manner tell them how she feels about you. She should respect her parents yet at the same time, it goes back to her living within and under her parent's domain. Don't pressure her as this will only increase tension between you and her parents. Be patient, keep your mind clear, focus on what you need to do to be able to take care of this girl for the future, like are you going to college, having an income to provide for her, getting your own place, because once you get your own place and she becomes of age, then you and her can make your own decisions and you could possibly marry her regardless of outside opinions|`|OHfZFR31aa	She is only 17, not legally an adult, so it's normal that she would listen to her parents. And most parents require that if you are living under their roof, you have to follow their rules<br>  <br>  Wait until she is 18 and old enough to move out and be on her own. Then it will be her decision whether or not she wants to be with you.<br>  <br>  As for arguments and disputes, too many are not normal in every relationship. If they are getting out of control or happening all the time, that's not a good sign for your relationship. If you can't disagree without screaming at each other, then there are problems in the relationship - especially if you are getting into disputes every week or several times a week.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	What I think you should do, as the so-called adult, is speak with her parents.  Invite them somewhere for lunch (you pay), just the three of you, perhaps.  Then, speak with them, grown up to grown ups.  Ask them for their honest opinion of you.  Ask them what they think you would need to change in order to become an good boyfriend for their daughter.  Explain to them that you are willing to hear them out and heed their advice, for one more chance at proving that you can be an exceptional boyfriend to their wonderful daughter.<br>  <br>  Or, you could just try complaining on Y!A like a little boy...<br>  <br>  PS - You can't delete answers.

XIuQyB7oaa	I think you are finally growing up and that's the changes and feelings you are feeling. Your way of thinking is becoming more mature and to be honest it sounds like your sister is not quite mature enough to understand this and your mother sounds like she relies heavily on you. I am a believer that family's should still help each other, but it sounds like your mom needs to help herself a little more.<br>  <br>  I can understand that you feel obliged to help, but put this all into perspective. You are the kid, she's the mom. She should be providing you with the support and with the care. It does not matter how old you are, a parent's responsibility doesn't end because their son wants to fly the coupe. It actually becomes even more important, showing them the ways. So I think you should have a word with your mom and explain that if you had to pay her mortgage you couldn't live for yourself.<br>  <br>  Even though you have suffered with clinical depression, it is not because you have no ambition or love for life, it is your situation. I do think that you are old enough now to find yourself as you say. I also think that your mind will get better once you are on your own. You will find that you can make friends easier and find that freedom to do what you want when you want, actually is helping your depression to keep in check.<br>  <br>  I think it is excellent that you are considering bettering yourself. That will enspire you to find your interests. You do need to change your way of thinking a little though, you should think of life as a challenge and enjoy doing it. Because with every little hurdle that you've jumped, you will feel the rewards very quickly and that will inspire you to do more...<br>  <br>  Good luck with your challenge and I would love to hear more about how you are getting on. I run a website where you can email me from, I know that you are not a baby, but there is some good information on parenting, and how parent's need to parent.|`|GFEWLxeiaa	You need to go back to school and finish your education.  You'll never be able to be independent without completing your education.  You can go to night school.<br>  <br>  Then, you need to see a psychologist.  You are being manipulated by your mother and sister.  Talk to a psychologist.  He/she will help you come up with a plan to become independent.  <br>  <br>  Your independence will not happen over night.  It's going to take alot of hard work, both school and psychological.  But you can do it if you're willing to work hard, and put in the time it takes to get educated, and develop self esteem, and a plan for your life.|`|qLhPXRpUaa	Aye get off the pity pot and get back to counseling! once you get that solid foundation with counseling head back to school! sit your a** down and take a look at the lil things in life you have your taking for granted! if you could wipe your own A** your doing hella good bro. can you see, smell, feel, walk, talk, hear whats up bro? what about your medication for that depression? you gotta get it together today! all this shi* your going threw now will make you a stronger person in the long run.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	you are allowing yourself to be a doormat. if you choose the behavior, then you choose the consequences. if you don't like your life, it is up to you to change it. stop being such  a cry baby|`|ZodtrOtCaa	how old is your sis and mom?<br>  then your sister should work part time that way you can go back to school too.

zBC6n34Naa	Different strokes for different folks.  For guys, a change in their woman is nice now and then.  He may prefer long hair, but that doesn't mean he doesn't like short (and you probably look great).|`|74gPuaXMaa	I can do short hair. I prefer it over long hair, but long hair works too. Brown eyes get me for some reason. Dark hair too. :)
Ey8CFhjMaa	Take a day off.<br>  <br>  No homework, school, friends. Just relax at home.<br>  <br>  Take a soothing bubble bath, dance/listen to your favorite music. Watch some hilarious comedies. <br>  <br>  Or express yourself through words on paper or drawings.<br>  <br>  Or cry it out, I always feel better and end up laughing at myself since what I cried for was so ridiculous!
VHCuxyCUaa	I'd finish college. Perhaps he can study at your college to so that you can live together? Then I'd move to Sweden or make him move to America. :D
Utp2nM8waa	Your Mom knows of him?  Well just invite him over for dinners and stuff and give your Mom a chance to get to know him. . . . . . .as your friend.  This young man, if he's a gentleman, will gladly put aside the boyfriend title and just be himself in order to give your Mom opportunity to see his good qualities, and when your Mom sees what a nice young man he is, she might lighten up.  Sneaking around will only validate suspicions. <br>  <br>  Now if that doesn't work (and it may take some time, but a nice fella will stay the course) you may have to assert yourself.  In the meantime ask questions about her feelings, share yours and pray, pray, pray.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Your mom doesn't want you to live on campus? She doesn't get to decide where you get to live. You say you are 18, but you do not act like it. Sneaking around is something stupid high school kids and younger do. It's time to come clean, no matter what. You risk loosing him by keeping this a secret.|`|ZodtrOtCaa	OMG that sounds like me what i'm going to be doing for my 3 daughters i'm already am with my 13 yr. old. With the boyfriend thing tell your  mom you should know that way i don't sneak behind you and things get worse that way  you'll get to know him too". with school campus sorry but I agree with her.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	If she is paying. Then if you don't do what she says she can cut off the money. Legally your old enough to do what you want. But with the freedom comes the responsibility as well.|`|0DfaG508aa	These things take time..wen i was 18 my mother was same like urs over protective and gv me absolute no freedom<br>  <br>  for now..meet ur boyfrnd outside the house only..<br>  <br>  once you are on own and get a job and stuff..things do change

Let me do the raising of her and if I need your advice I'll gladly ask.  Hurray for you being the nice aunt you are.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	tell your mom that if she thinks she can do a better job, then she can have Alexa. if she isn't willing to do that then tell her to stay out.|`|AA10776535	You don't owe her an explanation.  You will not be able to change her mind.  I have guardianship of my nephew and conservatorship of another who is 20 and autistic,  Its hard raising kids on your own, just do the best you can and don't worry about what mom says.  My mother always tried to defend them when they did wrong, i pull her aside and tell her to shut up basically.
6x2fLyvMaa	Either he's not strong enough yet to SAY it to you or he doesn't mean it.<br>  <br>  You can't be so sure yet - just give it time, and if he still doesn't tell you he loves you but he does only in texts, ask him why.<br>  But don't ask in a mean way - be polite - just ask him why he can only say 'i love you' in texts. see what he says then.<br>  <br>  If he says something like 'ok then, i love you..' in an annoyed way or something like that, he definitely doesn't mean it, and he's not worth your time.<br>  <br>  If he is honest with you and tells the truth, (like he isn't strong enough or something like that), then decide wether you think he means it or not and weather or not you still want to be with him.|`|OBT3C4zHaa	You haven't even been going out for a month. I highly doubt he truly means it, especially if he doesn't say it. It means he's not comfortable saying it. You shouldn't force him to say it, and he shouldn't be texting it if he doesn't mean it. Girls have issues with this too, it's not just a guy thing.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't make a big deal out of it until you guys have been together for a long time. Plus you said the relationship is "unofficial" so the word Love shouldn't even yet come to mind.|`|ise05jjUaa	Come on now you don't really believe that do you?  Especially after 5 days!  Have you slept with this dude yet?  If not it may just be a ploy to try & get you in the sack, but most times when dudes try that tactic they usually say it to you verbally.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Um, you can't love someone after just 5 days. And it means he doesn't really love you. At least not yet. Love grows, it doesn't just sprout as a flower right away. It starts as a seed and grows.|`|aPSjJqynaa	unless you knew eachother for a long time prior to when you actually started "officially dating" then I don't think anybody should say i love you to anybody that soon, cause then it would just be fake or immature. Thats not love girl, thats lust! You might think it will feel good to hear from him right now cause everything is new and your in that "Lovey Dovey" stage but trust me nothing good can come out of a speedy reationship. So take your time and for fun just text him back all the cutesie stuff cause texting keeps it not so seriouse.|`|tcEyuvlxaa	you have been dating for 5 days! you two don't love each other im sorry... he probably says it in text because it's easy to do and he doesn't have to actually say it to you. people say a lot of things in text that they wouldn't in person. just lay off until you mean it.. or if you want to know be a big person and ask him !|`|YeXP0FU9aa	That guy probably has commitment-phobia and doesn't really love you. At least, not yet.<br>  <br>  Ask him flat out why he refuses to say the L-word. If he becomes evasive, then you know he's not for real.|`|qO6EbH77aa	sorry but if its only been 5 days since youre "dating" i really cant see how it can be "love".... i think its just something he says nonchalantly, dont take it to heart.|`|cKugDkU2aa	He's probably not shy & comfortable. Give it time & patience. Then his I love yous will be all the time.|`|PGFD3IPGaa	no its not a guy thing. NO GUY (if they actually love the girl) DOESN'T SAY I LOVE U BACK. but there is always a chance of being very shy so its either way.|`|VwCzyJrPaa	hes gay|`|wZ9YQc3Caa	he doesnt truly love u if he is too embarrassed to say it out loud|`|1FAggU5Zaa	omg u guys bearly have what less then a month & u already want him to tell u in the face calm down... let him be for now after at least 2 months he will come out..|`|psLk5fDGaa	Because he doesn't mean it.
iE7k6Vzraa	His business- he works all the time but we barley make any money and its been that way for a few years.|`|u53ISZoXaa	Our fights usually start over money issues or over how we feel that the other person doesn't help out enought around the house.  Then it escalates into how he doesn't have to "take this crap" and that he could leave at any time.  blah blah blah.  Then we go to bed and everythign is fine.|`|QruXkDncaa	Just him being an asshole.<br>  Never telling me anything.<br>  <br>  It's pathetic.|`|aPSjJqynaa	Insecurity on both sides, because we both know eachothers past. Oh and I hate when he goes out with this one friend of his because I feel that he is a bad influence on him, and even though he is his own man there is always that one idiot pushing him to do something stupid, and he's disrepectful towards me to boot.! So we argue about his dumbass friends ALOT!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Friends!!  They try to change your mind about things or get you to do things your significant other wouldn't want you to do...  When my husband and I started dating, we found out who our true friends were.. EACH OTHER AND FAMILY ONLY.  Now we've been together over 3 years and married for 1 and everything's great!|`|kMHNuxi6aa	who cares, dump the loser.|`|6RDCSG9Gaa	Being insecure with each other. He gets uncomfortable when I'm around other guys who are really friendly with me, because they're usually flirting. He gets upset, I comfort him. I do the same sometimes too. Jealousy is a funny thing.<br>  <br>  We always get through it because we know no matter who was hitting on us, we're there for each other at the end of the night.|`|1oUF8AHAaa	The only thing me and my g/f argue about is her not talking to me about her problems and stuff. we've bin 2gether for ova a yr and thats the worst thing. whenever she feels depressed or shitty she just blocks me out and doesn't tell me why she's all shitty.<br>  But i still love her, FOREVER.|`|MMqGXkytaa	Him being unreliable and irresponsible. If you say your going to do something, call or be somewhere then do it, pick-up the phone and dial and be there. Nothing worse then waiting around and being stood up because someone else gets sidetracked.|`|81J81DGqaa	In my position, whatever my girl didn't get, we started to arguing. And when she had enough, she found a new boyfriend. That's the main thing for me.|`|amkvqb87aa	we dont really have huge arguments like that...<br>  hes a vegetarian and he gets kinda mad at me when i eat meat lol|`|tCTmtCUCaa	other people|`|qO6EbH77aa	i have not.
558BFdfTaa	It sounds quite healthy to me.<br>  <br>  try looking up femdom on the Wikipedia website|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	oh yes|`|pG9cufuHaa	there is a lot worse things out there (like people and animals) I mean human nature is just into some odd sexual fantasies, so I mean I would call it normal for you.. if thats what your into than why not.. me personally I am just a regular guy, wouldn't catch me doing it lol.. Maybe you just have a fetish for dominating a man.. pretty normal actually (especially in women)..|`|MMqGXkytaa	Who can really say what's normal to begin with and considering what's normal to one person may not be to another that's a question only you can answer. But as long as your not hurting anyone in the process go for it and enjoy yourself.|`|aPSjJqynaa	i think if it's out there and people are already doing it then it's normal, it might not be right but whatever now a days nothing is right and everything's accepted as normal. To each is own. So beat on buddy and get your Blue balls!|`|JaeIZZKRaa	Yikes!!!|`|AA11141163	Wow! That is completely cruel and so erotic at the same time.

tU5NJVL3aa	Whenever Mars is situated in 1, 4, 7, 8, or 12th house of a lunar chart it is called as "Manglik dosha, Kuja Dosha, Bhom Dosha or Angaraka Dosha, or Manglik Dosh".<br>  <br>  So if you were born on a Tuesday do not worry for you are not a manglik (Mars dominated native) as said by some Astrologers.  Mars in any other fiery sign, or also if in addition to Mars there are planets like Saturn, Rahu, Ketu in the above mentioned houses then also mangalik Dosha is rendered ineffective.<br>  <br>  Also note that there is no such term as Double Manglik.  It is a term coined by charlatans for their own benefit.  Mars in its own house, or in exaltation, will considerably reduce the ill effects of the Manglic Dosha.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Mars represents Self Esteem,Respect,Energy and Ego in a native. If manglik Dosha is there then it can make a natives temper volatile. Such natives have troubles adjusting with spouse and can sometimes become ruthless.<br>  <br>  Mars dominated natives have a tremendous fire like energy and if this energy is not utilized in something constructive then the above related problem arises.  Manglik Dosha generally affects the marital life. Effects of Mars/Mangal in the houses are as follows:<br>  <br>  Mars in the 1st house(Ascendant):It will have a drishti on (i.e.) it sees the 7th house.7th house being the house of spouse Mars will create quarrels on even minor issues. Here it indicates physical violence and sexual abuse. Because of cruel behavior such a native will be despised by society. Will not be able to gain assets.<br>  <br>  Mars in 4th house: This house also represents happiness. This also affects the work area. Will frequently change profession and jobs. Will not be economically successful. No job security .<br>  <br>  Mars in 7th house: Here it causes great anger. The native possesses extra energy. Will never be sexually satisfied for the partner will not be able to match such a native. Therefore it is possible that the native has a lot of partners or has an abnormal interests such as domination,fetish,bondage.Also will have differences with family members.<br>  <br>  Mars In 8th House: Loss of paternal property and bad relationship with the elders of the family. Will be lazy. Here brothers will also not help. Will vile away the time and will expect the spouse to earn.<br>  <br>  Mars in 12th house: Sudden financial losses are indicated in this house. Lot of enemies and the enemies will always trouble such a native. Will have lot of mental problems and anxiety.|`|cWuumdy7aa	please note to be manglk is not a sin so please do not worry. 50% of the world population is manglik so what happens. You need to get your horoscope matched with non manglik also as you may be manglik with the effect of mars getting neutralised due to placement of saturn and jupiter and other planets. many time your chart will not match the manglik but will match with non manglik as saturn in his chart can neutralise the manglik effect. consult a good astrologer. you can give your and boys birth detail to check the compatibility.|`|AA12346188	Dear Namita,<br>  I am very sorry this is happening in 21st century.<br>  I am at a loss to understand while nobody is following such non-sense in the world, why these Hindus are misguiding people with such nonsense.<br>  Whether your parents are educated brutes or illiterate fools?<br>  If they continue to follow unreliable and unscientific things, I will advise you to search for a person and marry and leave this people to their thinking and destiny.<br>  The life is very short on this planet, and why can't you become independent in thinking and living.|`|odMamtlKaa	Namarta,<br>  You will get married within a year ie till 2009.

BXd4I9mmaa	Yeah brokeback mountain - for sure|`|WvOvoxLxaa	The next time he says that, then respond with "you know I would sure like to know him, if he knows you better than I do, then I want to know this great guy. If he can make your life so happy then he should be my friend also.   Of course watch his face when this is said to see his reaction.  I wonder where he meets Joe, and what they do while together, I guess I would have someone follow him to find out.  I am with you it doesn't sound right, and if it is the gay thing, then you need to be protected.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Tell him you want to meet Joe.  He's an important part of your husband's life and you should get to know him.<br>  <br>  I'd be a bit curious to know whether he and Joe discussed you and so I'd ask him that.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Give the dude a break.  I have a couple of female friends that I would drop my world for and they would do the same for me.  I even have one friend who I am going to live with when we get old if our husbands don't last as long as we do.  This doesn't make me a lesbian, it just means I have really really good friends.  I think it is a blessing.|`|t81MEJ82aa	You are a woman so any and everything bothers you. Unless he lives out of town you should already know him so meet him already and get it over with.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Sounds to me like he has a man crush.  It's not necessarily gay, but it could be.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	It's just a close bond between two friends. My female friends and I are like that as well.|`|bDoJuBEkaa	It doesn't seem gay at all. Men have buddies that they are tight with, that they express 'man things' to cause well we don't really get it. <br>  <br>  As far as you knowing him better then anyone else that is a statement I would never make. You know him different then others but I learned a longtime ago when my sister-in-law said this about my brother what a ridiculous statement that is. Your saying you know him better then his mother, father, brothers, sisters or others who may have been there his whole life and shaped who he was long before you ever met him? I doubt that seriously. You may have different components to your relationship but that doesn't mean you know him better.|`|VAI6MtPIaa	They seem to be really good friends, like adult best friends. Ask your husband to invite "Joe" over for dinner one night so you can meet him. <br>  <br>  It is a little strange he would think this guy knows more about him than you do. Invite Joe over to dinner and see how they act to each other. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	I think that you already have this answer.  There has to be reason that you would be suspicious.  I am sure he has had other friends and something about this friendship isn't clicking with you for some reason.  I would meet Joe and have a long talk with your Husband as to how this looks and why.  Good Luck.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I always find it significant when a man's WIFE suspects him of being gay. You are the one who should have no doubt. Try to ask more questions. Tell him that you are getting suspicious of the two of you and see what he says.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Don't you know this friend he is so close with?

HSaG98QYaa	Why not both? That way you can use two different flavors. <br>  <br>  I suggest not using ice, though. Don't want to bruise her.|`|884v4VhGaa	Depends. If it's red Gatorade, do it right before they leave, it will hide any unfortunate lack of stains.<br>  <br>  If it's clear, the wedding is fine, because it won't show. She'll dry off her dress chasing you around to hang you from the tallest tree she can find, so it won't show at all. <br>  <br>  Any other colours save for once the dancing starts.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Douse her when she's walking out of the church - but make sure she removes her headphones so the people in the booth upstairs don't hear shrieking.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I hope you are kidding. Wedding dresses are expensive and no bride wants to be covered in Gatorade on her wedding day.|`|639298948c4890d7ed4e8f0489680e46aa	That certainly wouldn't be so expected, like when the bride and groom smash cake in each others faces.  That's so played out.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Right after you sign the loan papers, for the money you'll need to repay her for her dress.|`|TJrRPIFLaa	LOL - Probably never.

Maybe as she's walking down the aisle?<br>  The traditional and respected 'Gatorade dumping' is my favorite part.|`|w1necKzYaa	you don't! this is like the retard that threw custard on the bride then wondered why she was mad! those dresses are expensive!! like 6-1600 dollars!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I would wait for the reception, funny enough she just asked the same thing so watch out......|`|sGP6s7uraa	I agree with the first poster.<br>  <br>  Don't do that unless she agrees to do it.  WEDDING DRESSES COST A LOT OF MONEY.
djUMvICoaa	At least you had some decent connection with her and I'm sorry it ended the way it did.  Your head knows it's over and you can't trust her and she seems to have moved on anyway.  Your heart on the other hand is having trouble letting go.  That's normal and healthy as long as you don't let it rule your mind.  You have gone through the same thing as a death in the family, because you did lose something.  Now you have to grieve it and that process can take several months, until you get her out of your head.  The question is how is seeing her going to affect you, is it going to keep you at square one or pulling you back to it?  Then your process is going to take longer.  Once you come out the other end your head will be clear and you will be able to make good choices in a partner.  Until your head is clear you end up trying to replace her just to have someone in your life.  That is just a trap waiting to take you through the same process.  good luck|`|AA12382198	For a while use a close friend or family member as an intermediary.<br>  <br>  Use this person to drop off and pick up your son.....make sure you give each other 15 minutes so that you won't accidentally bump into each other.<br>  <br>  It's understandable how you feel.....make it easy on yourself until you feel stronger.|`|3vbHZBioaa	It's great you still want to be friends with your X that will only help your child in the long run...how you feel about her is normal you still loved her when she cheated on you but in your heart you know you would never be able to take her back..time will heal this pain just remember you are friends for your son and keep doing what your doing. I would advise talking to a counselor or close friend or family member to help you threw these hard times..You need to look at her as the mother of your child and that's it..Time will heal the pain.. Best of luck|`|82EM1kRJaa	It's kinda hard to get over someone. I think the reason is because you still mad at her because she cheated on you. The good solution is the face it. Just acting normally like you used to do. Just stop thinking about it by doing something you like when meeting her.<br>  Time passes by and soon everything will become normal to you. <br>  Only time can heal pain.|`|6BSHkiugaa	If she cheated on you there was somthing emotional missing from your relationship.  Maybe it is possible to find out what that was and work things out with her possibibly with therapy.  My spouse cheated on me and we are still together.  However, there are issues worse than the cheating itself. In my case it is abusive name calling and control.  If the two of you still care about each other why dont you ask If she wants to give it another try?Good luck!!|`|X6C6kZKKaa	you will get over it in time. as for being friends. if it works fine. you will move on. as time passes.|`|AA11416474	First of all time, will heal your hurt.  Been there..<br>  2ndly, does she want to get back together also???  cant chase her down if she isnt interested..  your what if's may not ever go away..<br>  If she is truly sorry   I mean, she should be begging you at your doorstep for forgiveness, not seeing that man anymore, regretting what she has done and feeling humiliated..  If you dont see those signs, then no I wouldnt get back together..  If you do.. Why not start dating again, and see what happens.  Look Ive been there.. And, I am back together with my hubby.  This was 6 years ago that it happened.. Its a rough rough road at first.. In time the trust gets easier and the hurt lessens.. You wont ever forget,,but the pain lessens.. He was remorseful.. IS she??   I am happy we are back together, and wouldnt change that one bit..  Goodluck.|`|p6QizgmRaa	It's going to take time. Keep reminding yourself that she abandoned your vows. Being friends is a good thing. Don't try to change that. And remember, she may very well still be messing around with other men.<br>  You'll move on in time. Unfortunately, we don't have an off switch when it comes to our feelings. Keep your focus on your son and his well being.|`|7V0zpsgOaa	You already have the answer.You said so yourself that you doubt the problem can be resolved.With no trust there is no relationship,do you want to keep wondering if she is doing what she says she is doing or if she is dong someone else?Just stay friends.|`|zGd6c60kaa	I honestly don't know how you could still be friends with her after what's she's done to you....I would get a 3rd party involved on arrangements when you see your son .... If willing, some therapy could help you through this.|`|O6utfwshaa	There is no easy way.  If you can start dating again that will help.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	You need three things. One you already have, and that is to recognize that you could never trust this woman so she is not good for you, regardless of how you feel.<br>  <br>  The second thing you need is someone to talk to and work your feelings out. If you don't have a close friend, see a therapist. That is what they do, provide you with someone to talk with until all the resentment and hurt disappears.<br>  <br>  The third thing you need is time. Believe it or not, the old adage that time heals all, is true. With therapy and time, you will be just friends with her.
3reHk4I1aa	as long as its just a friendship nothing else now if you were like secretly dating then it would be wrong but being friends with a guy that your friend likes there is nothing wrong with that i think that you feel bad because the guy hasnt done anything to ask out your friend|`|uJNVAA3saa	If it's just friendship then you shouldn't feel guilty.

unVj43Xxaa	I'd sit down and write him a letter telling him exactly how you feel and what you've been doing and how sorry you are (What you wrote here would be a good start). I'd also list some possible solutions and pick days or times to spend together. I'd also get counseling mainly for you but both of you will benefit. I'd give him the letter or email when your heading to work so he can have an argue free, quiet time to think about his response to you. If you married him then you shouldn't feel afraid to tell him things. Chances are he already thinks your crazy but that maybe something he liked about you.|`|AA12048821	you should ..and while you're at it , you should also tell him that you feel lonely, bored and scared.<br>  if you dont all this yelling and fighting could drive him away forever and then you'll be lonely forever.<br>  <br>  he wont think you are crazy if you tell him the truth. though he might think you are crazy noiw.<br>  <br>  if you are that bored , take up a hobby, buy a pet...it'll keep you too busy to fight|`|a2edfpedaa	well is there anything you like to do even if it is just knitting or fixing stuff or whatever there is always time for a little me time and for your family but i doesnt require arguing this is not his fault to tell u the truth its really ur thoughts and feelings that are getting in the way but yes you need to tell him or this could turn out bad|`|rQ7dI88Maa	Pick up a hobby that you can do and look forward to doing that.

Sounds like he's crying because he really loves you and doesn't like arguing with you.  For starters you two need to sleep together so you can feel closer to him.  <br>  <br>  When you're at work try to send him little text messages or leave him love notes in the morning.  Try to leave him special meals that you've cooked for him so that way in your free time you feel more like he's with you or you're doing things for him.  It should help combat your lonely feelings.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You schedules just aren't working out for you. You need to talk to him about that and explain that you hate how much time you have to spend alone and you want to fix it before it makes you crazy! I'm sure he probably feels the same way too.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	You don't have to stop or even know how to stop. <br>  <br>  When your husband gets tired of it, he's going to stop it for you. There are only so many times that you can start an argument before the other person stops caring to prevent the argument or just up and walks out and let you argue by yourself. To any normal person, arguing is a sign that something is wrong in the relationship and when arguments keep happening, they (smart people) figure it's best to end the relationship because you two obviously can't get along.|`|t81MEJ82aa	How joyously miserable and selfish you are? Since you are married I assume that you are an adult and have some skill at resolving problems. Simply tell your husband that you 2 need to come up with a way to spend more time together. Instead of creating problems in your marriage come up with a resolution. But you sound needy and very immature regardless of a solution. Try getting a hobby and a life.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	From the moment he walks out of your door, you'll soon realize, how to stop ! Communication is the pillar of a successfull relationship.

AA10353286	Personally, I'd try and get counseling. Talk to him and let him know his religious trip is not helping your relationship, but I wouldn't just sit back and hope for the best.<br>  <br>  Most marriages don't last, so don't stay just because you're trying to win the marriage marathon. Also, don't stay for the kids. Trust that they can sense your unhappiness, and you and their father are not showing them what love could be like. <br>  <br>  Nothing is perfect and marriage is no fairy tale. Frankly, at least in my experience, it sux quit often. But also, there is a lot to be learned from it. My husband and I have been married 6 years and together much longer. There were YEARS that I felt as you do, and with two kids, considered leaving. I have learned to be completely open and honest with my husband, and to also take everything one day at a time. Projecting into the future makes you sometimes feel as though your life is doomed because you wonder will your life always be so miserable. It will if you let it. So don't let it. <br>  <br>  Again, take things one day at a time. I have told my husband that there is no guarantee that we will be together forever, that that is not a promise I can keep, but that I will do everything to ensure that we are happy while we are together-and hopefully that will be a very long time. Since then, things have been great between us.|`|FVds9xiWaa	I write a blog about relationships, you can check it out here: <a href="http://mending-broken-relationships.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mending-broken-relationships.blog...</a><br>  <br>  I want to wish you the best of luck in trying to save your marriage.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	What in the world makes him so high and mighty.  This man breaks a commandment and now he walks around like his s**t don't stink.  I hate it when people do this.  I'm sure God has forgiven him but he probably hasn't forgiven himself..and that's the reason he has taken this faith thing as far as he has.  It's crazy how the mind works.  <br>  You must be looking at him as in "who is this crazy person in front of me".  I know I would.  It sounds like you may to get some counseling, marriage counseling.  You are going to have to tell how you feel and that you don't like living in that house anymore with him.  If he refuses to go, that is when you start looking and thinking of other sources.|`|lqtA2qhAaa	Oh my gosh!  Im going through the same thing with my sister in law at this time.  <br>  <br>  It sounds to me God is an excuse to be harmful and controlling over you.  Just because you do not attend church, does not mean you are not christian or religious, whatever your views may be.  You probably need to seek professional licensed counseling from a professional immediately.  Dont just get advice from people who really arent trained in giving advice.<br>  <br>  It sounds alittle absurd to not allow your children to trick or treat- I know some religions follow this, but it still seems alittle crazy to me.  When people start trying to control or preach religious scriptures to me, its a complete turn off.  I have my beliefs and simply I feel people try to twist bible verses into their own belief and try to "mess" with others minds.  You apparently see through this.<br>  <br>  My sister in law is not seeing through this at this time, and therefore she says all this crazy religious stuff to me that God has done this or God has said that, and its like what are you reading!?  People just twist Gods words.<br>  <br>  If hes cheated, treats you ugly, I would just be done wit hit.  Can you imagine that your child will see this and think its approriate to act this way towards their spouse if you stay?  <br>  <br>  It seems like you have tried everything you can, and at this point, its not working.  Try visiting a therapist together and alone before you give up though.  This may help save your marriage.|`|unVj43Xxaa	Leave. That's what I'd do and have. I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life being unhappy and showing my children an unhappy family life either. Even if you don't fight in front of them they are old enough to see there's no love which will only hurt them as they grow up and try to make good choices in a partner. I'd go and spend sometime being single and learning who I am again and being "me" and not "us".

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|qC9rN17laa	Hello i think you should consider counseling, this will support you with relationship issues and sex and intimacy, it is important that you talk to someone if you want to sort things out,<br>  most importantly for yourself....<br>  <br>  i recommend the online counseling service<br>  <a href="http://www.onlinecounsellingservice.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecounsellingservice.co.u...</a> - thats the uk site<br>  <a href="http://www.onlinecounselorservice.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecounselorservice.com</a> - that is the usa and international site<br>  <br>  good luck

How's it coming with the in laws by the way, you'll have to email me and let me know, keep me posted.<br>  I'd sit your Mom down and explain to her how truly sorry you are for forgetting her special day.  Pick up some flowers and a card, and have them waiting for her.   Maybe a little gift that you know she'll enjoy.... like a gift certificate for a massage, or a brunch, or even movie tickets and you two can go see a chick flick.....but really what will count most is the acknowledgment that you forgot and that you are deeply sorry.  You never meant to hurt her feelings, or alienate her, you've just had alot going on in your life.  Share with her whats happening and I'm sure she'll understand.  Mistakes happen Loo, you are a lovely daughter just for being so concerned with your Moms feelings.

With health issues with both your husband and son plus stress from the in-laws, it's lucky you remembered where you put your head.  <br>  <br>  How about doing something special?  Maybe a spa day for the two of you if she likes that sort of thing.  If money is an issue, look around for coupons or b-day specials or just check out what they have to offer and pick one or two things you can afford.  If she likes a particular type of food, make it or go to a restaurant that serves it.  I'd get her input on this.  She might have a favorite or one that she knows she doesn't like.  <br>  <br>  You don't have to go overboard financially or even in show.  I think a simple explanation telling her why and that you are sorry, and then something that she really enjoys (even if you don't) or some pampering should do the trick.  We all forget things, even the big stuff we never thought we would, from time to time especially when life bites us in the @ss.  I'm sure she'll understand.  I think she's probably just really waiting for some acknowledgment right now.  To ignore that you forgot is worse than the fessing up to it.|`|AA11955093	Well-In India we say God-couldn't be everywhere so He made mothers...<br>  It seems you had a pretty rough patch recently...<br>  Just confess to your mom that you forgot.Take her out for coffee or something and relive the pleasant past.<br>  Bottom line- You too have kids and would you forgive them if they forgot your birthday- while going through that you have gone through?<br>  You would I believe and so would your mom!<br>  Best of Luck!|`|DIKR2UUoaa	no idea, thats tough...

Just go grab the points. :-D|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I don't keep track of how many questions a person asks...
uij93NOjaa	The first thing you need to do is talk to her. Try and figure out what has changed because if you think by taking her out or, doing something romantic is going to cut it, it won't! Maybe when you two are just sitting around doing nothing, try and push a talk. I know it will be hard but it really has to be done first! After that and if everything worked out try and do something like plan a dinner. Take her somewhere, where you guys first hung out. Take a weekend somewhere, it can be local........ the whole point is just getting away and getting to know eachother again.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Communicate, tell her how you're feeling and see what she thinks too. You can do things "new" couples do like make a good meal together it involves communication and understanding. Go on a small weekend vacation maybe, me and my fiance will stay in a nice hotel once every other month just to get away from the regular routine. You got to mix it up a bit but remember to always keep close, shes not your friend shes your wife, touching her often lets her know shes desired whether its just holding her hand while you're walking or laying your head in her lap when you're watching T.V. Just looking at her with a little smile till she says, "what?" and you tell her how beautiful she is. I kin'dve see how it may get old or cheesey, but these are small things that make us secure when the relationships first start out. That's why people say they "wish it was like it used to be". You have to be like you used to be in order for them to be too right? BUT, communication is key, always ask how shes feeling about things, and tell her how you're feeling. Good luck with that.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Move your marriage up your list of priorities. Flirt with your wife. Spend time focused on her...even if it is just taking a walk around the block every few evenings.  When she is getting changed, give her a wolf call.  When you have behaviors that show you are a devoted husband who is in love with his wife, everything else will follow.<br>  <br>  You are a good man for recognizing that a void is developing between the two of you and wanting to be proactive to address it.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	You don't. All relationships go through phases. The best thing you can do is live in reality and realize this....but never stop romancing her no matter what! You'll never feel that "new love" feeling with each other again, at least not with the same intensity, but you can come close if both of you try to keep things exciting once in a while instead of taking advantage of each other and thinking "I already have her/him, so I don't need to try anymore". That's what goes wrong in most marriages.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Try to do a few of the things you did when you first met.  Go to a place that she loved when you guys first started dating.  <br>  <br>  Do spontaneous things with her.  Play her favorite slow song after dinner and dance with her.<br>  <br>  Try something romantic and fun.  She'll be flattered.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	TALK TO HER!!!!!!!! Tell her what you stated here. You need to communicate on how your feeling. She may be feeling the same way. The only way to fix something is to meet it half way and deal with it. TALK TO HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... NOT US?????|`|GU4S78ejaa	You both have to be completely dedicated to this relationship. I've been with my husband for 11 years & we've definitely had our ups & downs but we're the happiest we've been in a really long time. Try spending time together, go place, do things, talk about when you were first together, talk about all the happy times & memories you have, try to make new ones! But most importantly, make each other laugh & smile! That's the best feeling! Oh yeah, compliment her & make her feel special, loved. Good luck to you guys!|`|BgouZaeSaa	Hi try to talk with her and find a solution.If you don't want to talk,try to do things that you and your wife used to do and have fun.Make her surprises,ask her to go out but meet her in the restaurant like a date.Try when you are at home to have a nice time,drink wine and talk.Make her to feel that you flert her again.She wants to feel that you still want her and hunting her.I wish you good luck|`|Z68zEZmmaa	tell her you love her and how she means the world to you. Show her . Flowers, go on dates like you once did. talk about when you first meet and what attracted you to her. tell her she looks beautiful all the time. Be more affectionate
ySqErfn1aa	It just depends really.<br>  if you argue  A LOTTT,then that's not a good sign AT ALL.<br>  <br>  but if you have little differences,that can be good. <br>  Yall learn too love eachother with every flaw that either of you have,.|`|G9I9c9x9aa	HELL NO!!!

It's really embarrassing. Usually he do it around the house. If it's public, he'd make sure no one is close by, and let it rip. One time, someone totally came out from the corner at the street and heard it.

zYXCKhulaa	hey! it just happened a week ago. I got selected in the maths oltmpiad(MTG) first level. I got the hall-ticket for the next level two weeks b4 itself. It was written that one should get the sign of the principal with the photo attested. I forgot it almost completely. The day before the exam, only when I saw the hall-ticket I remembered. I could not do anything bcoz the next day I had the exam and I did not get the principal's signature. They won't allow me inside the exam hall for it. When I went to IIT institute that evening, everybody had got the sign with their respective school seal. I was too much embarrassed. It was more than a shame for me. When he asked me the reason for not getting the sign, to make the matter worse, I lied to the teacher that the principal was on leave for a week. It pricked my heart for lying that day bcoz I think so he discovered that I was lying. Then my mom went to school( it was sunday), she discovered that the principal was really on leave for a  week( she had gone out of station). So she looked out for the vice-principal. But he was not there. Then she went personally to his home, and got the sign. Poor mom! She strived hard, all bcoz of my utter carelessness! I learnt a huge lesson that day.|`|W5wCArLqaa	I was doing Tai Chi with my husband and I farted. It was really embarrassing to me. But funny too.|`|TwPF7EzYaa	I have none..but even if I had, I wouldn't say it to anyone especially here lol...Because this is embarrassing...<br>  <br>  how about you telling us, if u feel comfortable enough though|`|R2JSwpyVaa	hm...i wouldnt say it here...
13aQ6sA4aa	THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION...BUT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT IDEA ABOUT TALKING TO HIM. SHOW HIM THAT YOUR THE BETTER PERSON BY TALKING LETTING HIM KNOW THAT IT BOTHERS YOU WHEN HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THIS. BE THE BETTER PERSON AND MATURE. DONT FIGHT. COME ON WE ALL KNOW IT DOES NOT RESOLVE ANYTHING. IF ANYTHING IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE. IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE THEN AFTER YOU TALK TO HIM IF HE DOESN'T TRY TO CHANGE OR MAKE IT BETTER THEN I THINK ITS TIME YOU FIND ANOTHER DRUMMER FOR YOUR BAND. <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	he may not understand your disorder and may be just would like you to lighten up ,but your disorder wont let you .may be explain this to him it will work better then threats

e4ffd05d5175695c64fc913b628c28a3aa	May be he wants to show you he can have relations with anyone... irrespective of the age, size color or whatever. ha ha ha. He's a ........!|`|QHpq3QpAaa	He probably wants to show how much other women want him. He sounds like a dumbass.|`|AA11989999	Those might be the only pics he has, and he's unwilling to buy a webcam or camera to produce new, more current pics. That shows he's possibly cheap, lazy, and careless about the impression he gives others. Clueless about women.|`|Fx4ILfadaa	If he blackened out her face maybe he is tryng to say that the girls he is dating will get to be passionately kissed like that. he crossed ehr face out to show he doesnt care bout her anymore and thats what yo girls are missing out, a very happy passionate kiss.<br>  <br>  but i agree it is pretty dam stupid|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	What Melanie said.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	He's stupid. End of story.|`|rk2LknI7aa	jealousy...that it lol<br>  some girls get jealous easy and guys like it<br>  and maybe he like the picure<br>  or maybe the other girls right and hes just stupic which is what i think lol|`|mfmdFhsjaa	may be he wanna tell you ..<br>  how much he is in demand..|`|QI4uBnPUaa	waste of time|`|fNZaQwEDaa	You said it!

tpfxZZADaa	How is it creepy?<br>  <br>  Most women have a picture on their profile of themselves with friends (usually better looking than them, or male). <br>  The girls are his daughters, and the photo with the ex may be suggesting the sort of relationship he wants you to picture yourself in with him. It at least shows him happy, and not a piss wrecked yob.<br>  <br>  Sure, it is not a picture of him drinking milk and looking tough and manly, but actually not many guys like those sorts of photos of themselves.<br>  <br>  The idea of using a photo of yourself being happy with another woman in the past, sounds to me a good one. It may even spark some of that primitive jealousy women like yourself are driven towards guys by.|`|yFDHSzXCaa	mayube its a showoff picture lol|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	Maybe that's all the pictures he has... Or maybe he's like" yeah you could have this.."?|`|prdLQhAdaa	Because he is a) clueless (dumb)<br>  orr<br>  <br>  he is insecure and left the picture of him with his ex to prove hes not desperate & he can get chicks just fine... believe me guys do this... it makes them feel better about being on a dating site.|`|AMP2y4JVaa	maybe its to show that he's a good kisser and not intimidated or anything like that...but if hes on a singles website and blocked her face her out, more than likely over her... <br>  good luck (:
v4MguQ3iaa	You need to ask yourself these few questions to be able to narrow it down:  Do you want to site see and travel?  Do you want to relax and lay on the beach?  How long do you want to go?  Do you care what the weather will be like?<br>  <br>  If the answer is site see and travel I would narrow down your places that way.  The hard thing with Europe is that it is going to most likely be over $4K because you will want to stay longer and see more things.  <br>  <br>  Historical places in the U.S that I would suggest:<br>  <br>  Maine- We went on a wonderful 5 day lighthouse tour a few years back and it was fun and romantic and you got to hike and be outside the whole time<br>  Charleston, S.C it is beautiful and you can stay in some historic hotels /spas<br>  <br>  If you want to relax on a beach you can go to the Caribbean for $4K and you can probably get an all inclusive place.  (Depending on the time of year you are going) <br>  You can always make your honeymoon shorter and save money that way too.<br>  <br>  Lastly I really think the best thing to do is to meet with a travel agent and they can give you their recommendations. And contrary to belief they can get you really good deals with the hotels and resorts they work with.  (When we booked our honeymoon we also checked orbitz and all of the online websites and it was more money to book with them)<br>  <br>  Just some ideas!|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Flying to Europe will be the most expensive, and with the inflation you would definitely spend over $4000. Willamsburg and dc are nice and would be cheaper. Hawaii is going to more expensive but personally I love the beach so that's where I would go. Or what about Mexico? Cabo is gorgeous and flights are much cheaper than Hawaii. Hotels too.<br>  <br>  Use a travel agent to help find some good deals. Also be sure to tell the hotel you choose it's your honeymoon because they will usually give free perks and upgrades|`|YTEuq1fYaa	If your looking for romance you could try Italy.  It's filled with romance and love and art and fun!  Take a look :)<br>  <br>  BUT if you want something on there...<br>  Washington DC and Colonial Williamsburg is BEAUTIFUL!! I've been there and the sights are amazing.  I would definitely go there :)|`|EGpFJXDhaa	I got married and had my honeymoon in Hawaii. Both of us had never been there before. It was amazing! I would recommend. We went to the Big Island of Hawaii. We hope to plan another trip soon, this time to experience another island. Best of luck to you.|`|CQsD09D6aa	France, especially Paris, is very romantic.|`|Foep58JUaa	Go to Hawaii. Not Oahu though. I would suggest Maui or Kauai if you want to feel like you are in paradise. There are breath taking views of the mountains and ocean from most places on either island. The reason I say not to go to Oahu is that it's really busy and there is traffic to deal with and buildings blocking the view of the ocean. However, if you want to be able to go out to a "club" go to Oahu as there aren't any on Maui or Kauai. Because the economy is going through difficulty everywhere the price of tickets and hotel rooms are very reasonable right now. <br>  <br>  Another suggestion is perhaps you could go to Fiji or Tahiti. Maybe Bali? I just think that they'd be beautiful locales. Good luck in making your decision.|`|OL2zBhddaa	You should go to Corsica (part of France) for your honeymoon.  That is where I am going.  It is a gorgeous island in the Mediterranean.  That really is the main attraction is just exploring the island.  How much it would costs depends on alot of things.  When are you going?  During the summer, flight prices are much higher.  If you leave in September, they will be much more affordable.  Where will you stay?  Will you not accept something less than 5 stars, or would you be willing to stay at a 2 star hotel?  Where/what do you expect to eat?  An expensive restaurant in a touristic area will cost 10X more than if you had a picnic of bread, cheese and wine from the grocery store/bakery.   If you stayed one week:  I would say that you could spend $4,000 if you came during the off season and did not spend excessively.  However, if you came in August for a week and wanted to stay at expensive hotels and eat at expensive restaurants for every meal, I would say you would spend $12,000.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I would do either France or HI.  instead of a big 10 day trip staying in 3 star hotels, why don't you just go for 4 or 5 days and stay in wicked nice hotels?  that will be more memorable than mediocre service and room views I would think.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	I would want to go somewhere warm and beach-y . But that is just me.  Having lived near Washington D,C for a long time I wouldnt say go there for a honeymoon, but it all depends what you like personally.  My parents went to Bermuda for their honeymoon and they look back on it a lot and smile. :]|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I would go to the South of France, it is quite expensive but it wouldn't cost anywhere near 4K.<br>  You could visit Paris (the most romantic city in the world) and rent a little cottage to stay in.

Tonnes to see and do.|`|yrxENGqbaa	5) <br>  BERMUDA is beautiful <br>  <br>  if you go to horshoe beach it is absoloutley beautiful <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&ei=HaquSYLSItCCtwf__O2EBg&resnum=0&q=horseshoe%20beach%20in%20bermuda&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&ei...</a> <br>  or even France/Italy|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I think france will be more romantic you can also get a package to go to other european countries too..they are about 1500-2000|`|8fT10Lvbaa	France

I can "google" just about anything and find out information about it whether the information is made up or not is another story.  It all depends on what source is providing that information.  Whether or not it is credible or not.  It's the same as if you "google" aliens or UFOs.
545c8190dd574a20dff4291cb029a8ccaa	These are all approximate prices, based on experience being married to a foreigner.<br>  <br>  Minimum 1 trip to meet her in person:  $3000<br>  (1 week to her country, airfare, hotel, food)<br>  Apply to USCIS for visa permission:    $1100<br>  Medicals for her:                                $100<br>  Visa application:                                $130<br>  Her flight home:                                $1500<br>  Apply for green card:                         $1000<br>  <br>  These are minimums, if you are lucky (I'd even make the minimum $10,000).<br>  <br>  Figure that realistically, you'll have to fly to her country 3 or 4 times to prove to the embassy that you have a relationship.

How happy they are when they're around you can give away the clues.. You just have to keep trusting him. And if he's getting married to you, I'm sure he would try his best to fight off anyone who tried it on with him, no matter how drunk he might be at the time.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	We all get those feelings sometimes. Try to control those negative thoughts alitte more. Remember, he's with you. He doesn't want anyone else. So, take pride in that.|`|eGNC29v5aa	when people say "i trust him but not other women"... they actually dont trust him because no matter how much a woman literally throws herself at a man he is physically able to tell her to get lost and walk away! <br>  <br>  BUT, he just sounds like a normal bloke drinking with mates! unless you hear something or see something then i really wouldnt worry!<br>  <br>  At the end of the day someone could cheat and lets face it the other half could never find out so you will nover be 100% sure.
kv8ZFPP1aa	my middle name is marie. i don't think you have to give your baby a middle name, but it would be nice.|`|POHWTDPRaa	It is literally the middle name. After the first and before the last. No, it is not necessary.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	no, it's not necessary to have a middle name.  It's just traditional and another way to help distinguish between two people with the same name.|`|ke0dsgkkaa	A middle name is another given name. I've known plenty of people with no middle name, mostly elder. Lots of people may even give a maiden hyphenated name with married name to a child. Don't think it's necessary, but persons are more identified with a specific middle name.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	No, it is not necessary to give your baby a middle name. In some cultures the childs middle name is the mothers maiden name. I think that may be the way middle names started, but Im not sure.
VG2X9Ihkaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  There is only so much you can do for a person.  I understand your feelings for her making it harder for you to see her getting hit. But until she realises that she is in a bad relationship, there isn't much you can do for her.<br>  <br>  If you really care about her this much, you can stay as a friend but in sense of relationship, I think it would be best for you to move on.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.|`|1jHnQVvnaa	don,t change ur number bt stop to talk with her if she says something very bad to u don,t respond 0nly listen and tolerate be coll with her|`|H2zVWTFOaa	if you talk to her tell her that she needs better.|`|rAWQeHVKaa	No don't change your number.  I know things can be tough.  I was there at one time.  <br>  Just move on.  If you are intrested in this girl and if she sees you hanging out with somebody else, she may get jealous aand discover what she is missing out on.  Not that I am telling you to use somebody to get her jealous, but if she thinks you are "seeing" somebody else, it may turn her towards you!  <br>  <br>  Give her time and back off although I know it probably hurts you to see her get hurt by her bf.  She will come around!|`|JwnHKTabaa	Just move on, it'll save you more heartbreak.
dc776d2d94bba631445dca2196c0a858aa	Maybe she is confuse....cmonn she is in a situation where her guy kicks her ard and she lost her virginity with him...when a gurl lost her virginity with a guy, she has this feeling that other guys wont want her anymore...so she must have this feeling that she has to stick with this *** HOLE who does drugs and stuff...<br>  <br>  Anyway, tell her straight to her face that u are nt jealous..u just know that she doesnt deserve *** holes like that...and that u still have feelings for her..and if she finally made up her mind to be with u and be strong to go againts this *** holee....prob she could call u thru ur number...<br>  <br>  Move on..but dont change ur number..dont totally lose contact...u never know when she might change her mind...|`|EZ4gSX0laa	Kill the kid thats treating her bad.<br>  <br>  problem solved.|`|ZrS4I4lNaa	I was in a similar situation a while ago with one of my friends. <br>  <br>  I got sick to death of bailing her out every time he beat her up or abused her so in the end I had to stay away.<br>  <br>  I told her how I felt and that if she changed her mind I would always be there for her but that I couldn't stand by and watch someone hurt her like he was.<br>  <br>  2yrs on she's finally realised, moved back home with her parents and we're back in touch. <br>  <br>  It's a hard situation to be in but it has to be her decision to make. If anything, everyone saying he's no good for her will only make her closer to him. She'll grow up eventually and move on but for your own sanity I would say steer clear for a while x|`|nru7H9e2aa	Be with someone that respects you. There are hundreds of girls who think you are cool. Leave this girl out. She is just using you to get to him. Once you are out of the picture she will come hunting you down. But then simply show her the door. Find new experiences and new happiness. You will feel much better and not be this miserable. She and her mom, sis everybody can take care of her. You are not responsible for her. So just take all of them out of your life and smile. You will find relief and happiness.|`|gXedjLFiaa	Man that girl is coco.  Going out with that kind of guy for that long I think you would be way better suited for her. But don't change your number that is unnecessary. Also if she still really just thinks of you as a friend you should fing a girl more lke you and not turn you down like that.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Move on tell her if she ever needs someone to talk to you'll be there, but you just cant do this anymore..Good Luck|`|ke0dsgkkaa	You're a good friend to try to step up for her! Sadly enough this happens, I know I wouldn't put up with it. It seems some just can't leave a relationship, even when it's harmful. Sometimes it has to even get worse before they realize it, and think about getting out. There's something about a bad guy (so to speak) that attracts some girls, hopefully it's not too late and she ends up in trouble or worse. She thinks you're jealous, but she's in denial. It would be hard to not be a friend, but if you have to talk to her and see her less or at all for a while, maybe she will grow up before things worsen. You are again a true friend, no matter what anyone thinks, best to you all!
a6v7XnJwaa	i think u should move on like she did! or u could jst ignore her till u get her attention. we girls hate getting ignored! :-)) gud luck hope i helped!!
uIg6an6Jaa	yea change your ## and you email and junk like that <br>  <br>  get her out of your life <br>  <br>  if she is talking smack and all that then she is not a good friend and not worth it. plus you are what you surround your self with. so if you dont want t get involved in drugs and stuff like that then leave now|`|uij93NOjaa	Change your number!!! She is just stringing you along, girls like the feeling of someone wanting them. She is young and playing games with you. Move on and maybe even get a new girl to show her that you did. It would be a good idea to just cut her off all together and she will see what she missed out on!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	If you are sick of the whole situation, then I would move on. Why don't you just give her some time and see if anything changes at all. Stop talking to her and answering her calls for a while and see if that gets her to start thinking more clearly.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	YES!|`|6dQT8uM3aa	Tell her plainly "i dont need friends" and finish with her and her drama forget her and avoid her totally, finish with her. there are some other girls with whom to have a friendship or a loving relationship without the drama.|`|9hkcBmzAaa	I definatly understand why you are upset. And i would be too if i was you. I dont understand why she is still with him i guess maybe she feels that since she had sex with him she needs to be with him idk?.<br>  But i think you are just hurting yourself by putting up with her. I mean you did all that you could do to help her and she is still hanging out with him. Shes being stupid and you cant help someone who doesnt want to help themselves. I guess it is just up to you and how you think you should handle it. Maybe have a serious conversation with her maybe she jsut needs someone. But then again for her to sit there and say your JELIOUS thats ignorant. Ya you want to be with her but your not jelious. Tell her why would i be jelious of someone who abuses girls and does drugs and is messed up.<br>  but if she just continues to upset you than just forget about her and move on i guess. It sucks thats shes acting like this but i hope she comes to her sinces because you seem like a great guy and you would treat her with respect! unlike him!<br>  well ttyl hope everything works for ya!<br>  <br>  and turn that frown upside down i dont like to see people sad. Even if its an avitar. lol :]|`|Xf7u9P0Maa	YES!!! DEFFiNATLY i mean someone who wont see you for who you are then its not worth it she is just playin around with your head you should just move on to better....there's a lot of girls and you should just forget about her i mean if you wanna be her friend then you can but dont get with her cuz imagine if she kissed you while she was with her bf imagine if she is with you wat kind of things she would do behind your back ...soo my best advice is to move on !! :) good luck|`|Yby3loNEaa	you sound like you really like her a lot. but she to me seems like those girls i stayed away from when i was younger. she is playing mind games with you that's all and she isn't your friend. i went out with this guy in hs and it was going good we were together for 8 months and told me that he loved me and all that, well his ex who is a S*ut that saw that we were together, and one of our friends wake. she wrote him a letter and took him away from me and she only did it because she wanted to just take him away. stop the pain and move on and find a really person that wants to be with you good luck|`|nMDh2ze4aa	That is the best thing to do. (change your number and move on)<br>  Sounds to me your a nice guy, you deserve better than a gf who cant put down drugs for you, or choose already. You or the other guy and drugs. Honestly to me, (if I were in her shoes) it would be an easy choice to make. Move on, someone else somewhere can give you the relationship your looking for, and mostly an honest one.|`|AA12048821	you've told her how you feel..she refuses to listen to you and is still with this other guy...<br>  <br>  tell her that if she wants to destroy her life she can do it by herself and that you dont want to be stand by watching. <br>  also tell her that if she finally decided that she likes you and just you, you'll be around but that you will be moving on.<br>  <br>  some people take a long time to recogonize their mistakes and they need to understand it themselves.|`|uwZ9AL38aa	You should stop talking to this girl and move on. Don't try to have a relationship with a girl that talks smack abot you. Change your phone number, meet somebody else.|`|94cb9b0a3675595219bfab181ba4f42daa	Move on!!  You aren't going to get anywhere with this girl and she doesn't like you anyway!! Get on with your life and find a girl who wants you!!!|`|CysVPqXsaa	If you really like her and have feelings for for, then continue what you are doing to save her, but don't say anything to her about your feelings since you know that doesn't work with her. Just be patient, she'll soon come around, and when she breaks up with him, then you should speak to her see how she feels, tell her how you feel about her, tell her what you would do for her, and just let her know everything, and tell it's not because you are jealous, it's just that you really care about her, and want her to have what's best because you really care. She might come around, but just be patient with her (her mother seems to think you are the kind of person for her, and that's a good sign).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!! Good Luck!!!!!|`|aErUKUvVaa	u should get out of town fast.  first off you both 2 young to be in volved in a situation like this.  2nd, she needs to steer clear of this guy totally, but if uv trie to help her do that, and no reply or response, get parents involved.  again and again and again if need be.  someone's gotta help this girl before she makes a habit of getting involved with the wrong crowd for life.... it doesnt turn out pretty if that starts at y'alls age.....|`|O3fcLsKMaa	The best thing you can do is permanently cut all contact with her.  I say permanently because some people think a couple of weeks or months, I'll be over it and we can be friends again, NO.  You have to stop talking to her for the rest of your life and move on to someone who isn't as dysfunctional as she is.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Didn't you ask this the other day?  If you don't have an answer for yourself on how you would like to be treated, then why ask strangers.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	If telling her to leave him doesn't work, then leave her syupid ***.

Don't beat around the bush.  There are many tough decisions when it comes to weddings (making commitment to one another, for example.)  You have to limit the number of guests, the amount of food, the size of the band, etc.  So, to say that you only want one or three bridesmaids is your decision, albeit tough.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	that's too bad, maybe your photog can photoshop the tatts off of her in your photos but if she ever sees the photos like that, she'll be pissed.  it's hard but you shouldn't have let her invite herself into the wedding party,there's no way to kick her out now unless you're willing to ruin your friendship forever.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Make her wear a dress that covers it, or tell her to wear cover up!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	It wouldn't bother me so long as they were covered up during the ceremony in church.  My own tattoos won't be showing in church, I was raised that it just isn't appropriate to have tattoos showing in church.<br>  <br>  After the ceremony, I wouldn't care because even I will have my own tattoos exposed.<br>  Although, I might wonder why she would tattoo pistols on herself - - - they aren't a very feminine design IMO.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Yeah, just be straight up and honest with her.<br>  <br>  Don't mention the tattoos to her, b/c it will just add fuel to the fire...<br>  <br>  <br>  Say exactly what you told us here...

She'll probably be hurt, but she will get over it...|`|sGP6s7uraa	If you don't want her in the wedding, politely dump her because she is a drama queen (as you said).  You don't need that.  As for the tattoos - cover up if she'll have it.  Tell her it's your wedding and when the reception starts she can wash it off.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	As she volunteered you are at liberty to change your mind, if she is only a borderline friend then you should not feel embarrassed to make up a little white lie about numbers or something.<br>  If you cant do this, you should insist that she buys a different dress that covers the front of her and be blunt about her tattoos, tell her you have nothing against them but you would rather not have them showing in your wedding pics.<br>  If she doesn't compromise then you will have no alternative but to say she cant do it.<br>  This is supposed to be the most special day of your life dont let it go wrong because you cant speak out.<br>  My matron of honour has a huge back piece tattoo and she is wearing a shawl/warp in church so its not seen, not once did she take offence and for me I have two large 5" x 6" tattoos on my shoulder blades which I am covering up with a satin bolero jacket for the ceremony.<br>  It has to be done in good taste for the church surely ?|`|mKWwz1uUaa	This is your wedding and sounds like she has takin over!

But it wouldn't make me demote her from being a bridesmaid. <br>  <br>  If it really bothers you though; you can photoshop it out ;)<br>  <br>  EDIT - apparently everyone here thinks that tattoos are beautiful. All I meant was that I don't think they're particularly nice to look at, and that it would irritate me a bit if I'd chosen her to be a BM and then she gets huge pistols emblazoned across her chest. I'm not a shallow bridezilla; I would never dream of judging anyone for their appearance - my FIANCE has tattoos - I would certainly never not allow a friend to not be a BM because of her tattoos.

lPR2NZSZaa	A traditional grounds for divorce include; adultary, physical or mental cruelty, abandonment and irreconcilable differences. If you have DNA that proves the baby was not your this fits under the adultary exception and can ask for a divorce on thoses grounds. In many states, couples who both consent to the divorce can submit what is called an uncontested/joint divorce petition. You can usually only do this if you agree on all aspects of the divorce such as martial property, support, and custody. Some states also allow you to get a divorce even if some issues are not in agreement. Remember you do not need the other spouses consent to a get a divorce. Some times it pays to get your divorce done by a Legal Document Preparer (LDP) and not a Lawyer. A LDP can usually do it cheaper because they only prepare the paper work and do not go to court. That is where lawyers charge you the most in court appearances. It could be a lawyer is padding his bill by wanting to make an appearance. To be fair your state may make it procedurally necessary to go in front of a judge even in a no contest situation as a safe guard against fraud or duress in the divorce process. It takes about 9 to 12 months to complete the process. It may pay to consult an attorney or go online to the National Association of Legal Document Preparers (NALDP) to find a LDP who may be able to answer your specific question.<br>  .|`|tCiVuFK9aa	DNA proves she committed adultery and she moved out abandonment. Both grounds for divorce if you live in a state which requires grounds. Most states don't require any grounds these days.  That's why it is so easy for people to just quit and get a divorce.

DNA from a child she had while you were married would be adequate proof. The more proof the better, just to make the case very strong and not allow her to claim you were separated, or give any other reason.<br>  I would include a copy of the DNA of the child, the DOB of the child, etc. However, any other proof (emails, texts, witness accounts, phone calls, etc) would be beneficial as well.|`|eqkiNvoQaa	um.. absolutly, i would just say get a good lawyer do your homework/research. and obviously you  have proof that there wasa cheating, so ir sounds like you have a good case,|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	So you have proof of infidelity and are still going to ask if that's grounds for divorce?

xGr2QYWDaa	Yes, you can develop long lasting friendships that may lead to you wanting to meet the person. <br>  <br>  Depending on how much you chat or e-mail or keep close contact with others, you build strong relationships and this helps when you are thinking of meeting face to face. <br>  <br>  By the conversations that you have and the things you have in common, and talking back and forth and asking each other for advice, you could take a strong liking to another person and eventually fall in love or become infatuated or be obsessed with them.<br>  <br>  You might exchange pics, but who's to say they're real? The person on the other end might not want you to see the real (pic) because maybe they are afraid of rejection, so they'll tell you they look a certain way, but in reality, they are the opposite or they are what they wish they could look like.<br>  <br>  So....use caution with net friends/relationships because they may already be married or underage and if they lead you on, you may fall into a disappointing situation and may get hurt.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Yes i do. but of course need to be extra careful.|`|ji8J9k6Baa	A.M.~ <br>  Im going to start my answer off to your question with a question of my own....why would there not be?<br>  <br>  The key word you wrote in your question was "friends"~ the next most important word "feelings". <br>  <br>   The object that they are 'net friends' is irrelevant. They could be friends in any type of condition,and it would not change any thing at all.<br>  <br>  Net/computer friends, friends at school, friends at work, friends who only see one another on the bus, friends who only see one another at the coffee shop.<br>  <br>  They could only be friends by correspondence,<br>  by email, by  texting, by ham radio (back in that day and age). <br>  <br>  Any time two people come together and form a friendship, there is always the possibility of feelings forming. <br>  <br>  Weather they are feelings towards a deeper form of friendship, or love, or they could even be feelings in the opposite direction, towards anger and dislike. <br>  <br>   Any time friendship is formed so are feelings.|`|WhYTUzMuaa	yes why not as i believe feelings won't develop with looks only<br>  you can have feelings when u understand each other and when u feel comfortable with each other,you can trust ,care and share whatever u like to|`|ZJCjgOPuaa	yes there can be feelings between net friends<br>  <br>  i would like to tell u that i met my love on net itself.|`|eE9PczZBaa	yes|`|KljiuCH0aa	Well yeah..you can be really close...talking to each other everyday and having so much fun...you trust the person and you count on him/her and after a while you CAN have feelings for each other but be careful...things may be different than the way it seems =D|`|1jHnQVvnaa	wen it will take a long time and wen both r interested to know everything about eachother then there is chances of feelings|`|AA10222783	there can be feelings between net friends, phone friends, pen pals....so the answer is yes|`|d222d3f47043def4bb4ae3e895ef58c1aa	that is so possible ... i met people who became my friends too ... just stay away from perverts!|`|H2zVWTFOaa	some times there can be and sometimes there can't.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Yes as human have feeling.|`|3reHk4I1aa	sure

JDUhhAQyaa	I know what your saying and am sorry it all worked out that way.<br>  But even if you don't need his money, you can put in in an account for his and your daughter as she will want to go to University one day time<br>  to start that for her and make him pay for her,for when she grows up you can tell her her father paid for her Education that's one way for her to feel better about her father later on in live (thinking of your daughter) and her feelings later on in her life.<br>  As for you hon you know he's a loser is trying to dismiss the fact he has a responsibility to his child make him live up to it,if not by being a father then with his $ for her schooling.<br>  Now as for you my dear I have been separated from a man like both your first ex and your father of your child. I had 2 in one that's when I decided to spend some time with my children and myself for the passed 2 yr.s it was easier then I thought it would be, mind you there was many a times I cried but I am mostly happy now that I have done this.I got really into my bible and spent my time working and with God.Today I am a complete independent women that loves me and my family .If I meet a really nice man then I will probably wait and see if he's date worthy of me not just jump into it, like I did before 2 times.I think your lonely right now and if you don't mind my saying have a little after birth blues.I can tell you I did have the same thing after my daughter was born and found later it had nothing this had nothing to do with rejection as it was me that was causing all my problems as I didn't really know myself to give into any good relationships.So to answer your question time out with your daughter will be your best bet like I do.Good luck and I sure pray you stop picking losers! I did.And find the beauty in you.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	bla bla bla way to long|`|GU4S78ejaa	I have no clue going through & won't pretend but I think you should focus on your daughter & quit wasting time or energy on that jerk! Since your daughter won't have her father around for her, you need to be there even more. My dad wasn't around but it helped that I had & still have my mom there for me, still as an adult. 1 day he will realize what a huge mistake he made or maybe he won't. Either way, your daughter will be ok as long as she is sorrounded by people who love her. You or her don't need that in your life. You deserve someone who is going to be there for you's. I wish you love & happiness!|`|Zca1PGERaa	you must stop this self torture it is killing you dont let him come back your daughter doesnt need to go through what you are going through being picked up and dropped like a toy<br>  <br>  stop seeing him and start thinking about meeting someone else|`|5UDNR37raa	I will put it to you like this. What your daughter deserves is for her Mother (who could very well be the only parent involved in her life) to be strong and stop concerning yourself with ANY man for awhile. You have not allowed yourself time to get to know YOU and reinvent YOU!  <br>  <br>  I cannot say that we've been through the same thing, but I am a divorcee for 9 years now. I was celibate for 6 of those years. When God saw that I was ready for love again, he blessed me with a wonderful Guy. Our relationship is all that I dreamed.  I brought a daughter and He a daughter and son into the relationship. I was married for 7years and he for about 12years. We've been together for 3years GREAT<br>  years... (AND NO!  WE DO NOT LIVE TOGETHER)<br>  <br>  You have to figure out what you want!  You sound like you need to love yourself more so that your daughter will not miss out on the BEST of you! Believe me, your child will<br>  suffer because of your MAN issues. (I AM NOT SAYING THIS TO BE HURTFUL)  <br>  <br>  As for her father. Take a stand!  Do not allow him to play games with you. You have to be like a LIONESS to protect your daughter. Do not allow him to have any control or play any games. If you must, get a child support and visitation order in place. Otherwise, he will just show up whenever he wants to see what YOU are up to. But hopefully he will be <br>  as great a father as my dad and brother (LLOYD SR & JR)<br>  who are in Heaven now!<br>  <br>  I hope my advice helps you.  and God bless|`|lqtA2qhAaa	You seriously need to seek PROFESSIONAL counsel from a licensed psychiatrist or therapist.  <br>  <br>  You need to think of the daughter involved- and if that means taking him to court for $$$ then thats what you got to do.  Forget about yourself.  Youve become self indulged if you are not thinking of your child at this point.  Your feelings are completely irrelevant.  <br>  <br>  Take him to court whether you love him or not, get the dough, and peace out.  If he doesnt want to be there for your daughter, find a man that will.  Because believe it or not- there are men who want families, and finding a woman who already has one is not a deterant (sp?).  <br>  <br>  Take advice from your friends and family- they are helping you whether you chose to believe it or not.  They only want the best for you.  They dont want to deal wth the hurt or pain either.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	You need to focus on yourself and on getting well...Your child needs you. <br>  <br>  If you were alone, you could dwell on self-pity for years if you wanted; but you are not alone anymore. You have the responsability of this child in your hands; so do what is right, and seek professional help.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Be patient and try to work out your issues. Ask God to heal you and guide you.|`|gb9REJN4aa	I'm really sorry you're hurting so badly. Listen, you need to get over this man. He is not good for you, and he doesn't sound like a very good man, either. Your daughter will not have her father at home, which is indeed unfortunate. Nonetheless, there are many one-parent households where the children turn out great, and you need to do the best you can for your daughter.<br>  <br>  I think that probably means NOT being involved with a man for a year or so. It gives you time to get over the men of your past, is what I've found. Then you can go out and start fresh with somebody new, who will be a good father to your daughter and who will want to share in your life without causing you such pain and grief.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

I mean i dont know what height u r, but 8st 5 sounds underweight not blady overweight or fat! Dont worry, ur a loverly size, and u shuldnt need ur mother in law pointing out the obvious of u putting on some weight. This just puts to the point that people like skinny people. Its disgusting. Ignore her, i would flip too. Tell her to stop it, and that you dont appreciate her comments. Tell your husband to step in a little too, its his mother! And ur his wife, he should stick up for u|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	U could politely..tell that u noe whats ur weight and that u don't really feel comfortable being reminded all the time.

My mum used to be the same with me she would tell me how wobbly my belly was and how I look disgusting. I think it is probably due to jealousy either of your looks or that you are a female threat to her by taking her son from her in a way. I would say something either say it back to her or tell her that it upsets you. If you get on pretty well just sit her down and say "I have weight issues and I would really appreciate if you didn't bring it up anymore because it hurts my feelings" this won't upset her or you.

And shed realize that in the end youre always there for her and that youre the guy for her. its an idea. But i bet its hard for you to see her and not be dating yano? ugh im glad my bf broke up with me n just left it at that, its been 8 months and i havent seen or talked to him. its been easier that way. But i duno about 7 years..youve gone through alot itd be crazy to just delete eachother out of your lives. yeah have fun with her until she comes around i guess...but if time goes by and you still see nothing with her then..move on and find some one new? good luck hope i helped! youll be okay though! keep your head up!! <3 isabella|`|XZEaQ4Myaa	you can also try to be just friend of her.<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN<br>  Hannah|`|1Dxu2375aa	That is a long time 7 years she just want to be ur friend my boyfriend broke up with me and he siad we can be friends to and yr not he want talke to me any more becaues i find a boyfriend|`|OS24ICPRaa	well she obvoisly still loves you because you guys were together for so long and she still calls you and wants to hang out with you so maybe she is waiting for you to get sober. she may have broken up with you for good becuase she doesnt want to say "we are over til you get sober" because she doesn't want to get her hopes up, or she wants to prove a point, or maybe she just cannot be with you until you get sober on your own......i dont know what you need to get sober from but i advise you doing it not only for her but for yourself and if she doesnt wana be with you still then you'll be able to find someone who does easier becuase most nice girls would prolly also like you to be sober|`|tkFMTz60aa	I think that she wants you to get help for your drinking and whats she is doing is taking herself out of the picture.

XQe8rlH7aa	Your definitely right, it's the little things that goes a long way, especially with the length of time you've been married, sometimes we forget how to "date" on another.<br>  <br>  The key to a woman's panties is not so much the physical but the mental/emotional.  Women give or withhold sex based off of how we feel.  So your job would be to change how she feels.<br>  <br>  I would suggest having a conversation about her, find out if there is something concerning her, how she feels about the direction her life is taking, things like that.  <br>  <br>  Change things up a bit, court her similar to how things were 13/14 years ago.  When you were pursing her you studied her, found out her likes and dislikes, what made her smile or cry, you noticed the slightest change in her lipstick color, how she liked to wear her hair...you have to study her and find out who she is today, the good thing about it is, you've done it once so you can do it again.<br>  <br>  I hope all works out well with you and your family.  Good luck!!|`|bDoJuBEkaa	Well first off people don't seem to get that your probably a guy since you ask ladies what would make them feel special.<br>  <br>  What are some of her favorite things/activities. Try going out to a play, a small quiet jazz club. Come home early occasionally (if possible) and fix her dinner. Leave a little love note in the bathroom telling her how you feel and how much you appreciate her. <br>  <br>  Mostly it boils down to letting her know in little ways that you love and appreciate her.<br>  <br>  Yes if you work on the closeness and intimacy the sexual relationship will follow.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Put Viagra in his food.

So, if a teacher has her specialization in secondary ed, even if she is right out of school, she works in secondary ed.  <br>  <br>  They should use only older, uglier and more experienced teachers for high school grades, not good looking young teachers.

bNuuxJv1aa	There is nothing wrong with having sex alot but just make sure that is not just what he wants out of you. If you two seem to have a pretty good relationship then I don't think it will come in between the relationship.|`|AA11632061	No! it is normal, you are not 11 any more. It is normal sex in not between a relationship but PART of the relationship. Enjoy your self and make the best of it.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|2h2fsOOvaa	no its not a bad thing sex is fun but if u want u can just cut back many half on how many times ur doing it now|`|YBIiEF3Paa	enjoy while it lasts!|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	consider that a plus sign in the relationship.  Rather have more than not having anything at all.
VAI6MtPIaa	I feel so bad for her but she needs to finally be able to say enough is enough! She hasn't reached that point yet in her life to stop dealing with this guys crap! The simple fact that he talks down to her and cheats on her is why I would advise her to divorce him. <br>  <br>  Most daycares (preschools or whatever) will open earlier for a person if they ask them to. There is no need for her to allow him into her house for that half hour after he left. She can explain her case and arrangements will be made. I mean, why can't he wait in the driveway and she'll bring the child out ready for daycare.. and he can take her to school or wait outside in his car? That situation sounds fishy. <br>  <br>  Now, he is starting to see her live her life the way she should, without him.. and he all of a sudden wants her back? I really hope she realizes befoer its too late. If this guy has seen "God" then maybe he needs to be going to church.. praying to God and all of that matter instead of acting like the jerk he is. <br>  <br>  He somehow created her to be almost like a servant to him... doing what he wants, acting how he wants her to.. jumping through the hoops he needs her to go through. It's sad and I know how it feels to be put through that. There's nothing you can really do right now. She had to see the darkness so she can help herself to get into the light. What I would do would be to invite her out to lunch. Take her out away from her controlling husband and talk to her. Explain how you feel about everything because even if your husband sent the letter.. it doesn't mean she recieved it (the husband could have interceeded it). She may not know there is a way out and away from him... most women feel they need to stick with the person and I'm sorry to say but that is how this sounds. At lunch bring her divorce papers or plans to get her out of her situation. Maybe, just maybe, her husband did change (but more than likely not). She'll want out after he's put her through enough. She might feel obligated to stay.. it's uncertain. <br>  <br>  My family is a lot like yours. We defend our own and if you mess with one of us.. someone will be going after you. Its always been like that. I think it was smart of you and your husband to want out of it considering it was beginning to hurt your marriage. Your marriage is important and should be your most important thing in your life even if your sister is having all of these issues that you can't help with. <br>  <br>  I really think you should take her for lunch and discuss it all with her. She's your family but you can only do so much. <br>  <br>  <br>  *Btw.. by the term sister I mean sister in law|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Please understand this statement:  "It is not wise to drink to deeply at the well of another man's sorrow"!<br>  <br>  You are in a place that you choose to be and it was never your problem.  You can not assume all families operate under the same principles and guidelines.  Your energies should be to your family.  What you are calling help is keeping you nose in their business regardless of what motive you identified.  Leave them to their own mess.  Her husband is not your husband and she is not you.  Her father does not have to be the same kind of father that you have had. You have reaped the fool's blessing in your physical body because this has been a play-by-play drama/excitement for you!<br>  <br>  Stop it and live your life independently of others.  If you be honest with yourself and stay forcused on yourself, there is enough work there to be done to take a life-time.<br>  <br>  You are out of place.  Spiritually and emotionally.  That is not your marriage.  Act like it.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You are all way too involved in this (maybe because you seem to be from a mob family). They are adults, making their own poor choices, and it's none of your business. It's shocking that your husband is a counselor and his idea of appropriate is to write her a four hour letter. It's none of his business.<br>  <br>  Stop letting her talk to you about the three ring circus of her life. You know entirely too much. You also seem to be having panic attacks over someone else's life? That's so dramatic.<br>  <br>  ps If he won't stay faithful, it's unreasonable to expect him to keep his word on mowing the grass.|`|6YTSD3pdaa	Just let her go... she will in her own time know what kind of a man she has, and she will be sorry she didnt listen to you. She will learn the hard way, and  that is the only way she wants to go, so let her be. you and your man just move on b4 you guys start having problem bcuz of this. good luck..|`|7YTiooX5aa	Wow....I don't blame you for going on with your lives without her involved however why can't you just tell her that until she sees the light you no longer are welcoming him in your household and no longer will do anything for her while she is with him but leave your niece out of it. You should still be able to see her and she is probably going to need someone in her life that makes since. Surly you don't want her growing up to think that it is okay for a man to treat her that way. She is going to need someone supportive in her life and I hate to say it but from the way things sound it won't be her parents.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	The only advice I can give you is to MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!!!!!!! I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm trying to tell you there is nothing you or anybody else can do about their situation!!!!!!!! It's their business I guess. If she doesn't want to listen, then your just wasting your time!!!!!! this doesn't really concern you. I think it is a very sick situation also. But if she doesn't want to help herself, then you need to take a step back and STOP trying. Because it's going to get you NO WHERE in the end!!!!!!!!! Concentrate on your own family.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I don't see the issue since you and your husband decided to move on. There's helping someone and then there's taking on their problems. Your sister-in-law has her own problems to work through but you cannot force her to change her perspective. If you 2 need to step back and not have contact with her then do it for the sake of your own family. If you want to help her then simply lend her assistance but do not overstep your bound. You shouldn't butt into other people's marriage anyway. <br>  <br>  For example, if she needed a ride to a job interview, instead of simply dropping her off, it seems as if you 2 are getting her the application, pulling strings to get her an interview, doing her resume, etc. Of course that's going to wear you down after awhile.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Just cut her out of your lives until she gets the point. Don't go where she (and he) will be, don't give her any help. Sometimes the only way to deal with this kind of thing is to not deal with it!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Honestly, I think you got too involved in this. This is between him and her. You decided to save a woman that didn't want to be saved. I'm surprised your husband doesn't get it since he is a counselor. he should know you can't help a person that refuses to see the problem. This woman, for whatever reason, doesn't think she can make it on her own. She has decided to look the other way and get her life back to "normal". YOU guys will come out of this looking like the bad guys, not him. I suggest you take a couple of big steps back and disconnect from this. It's not worth the stress it causes you. Especially when it isn't even about you. Stop wringing your hands over this and let it go. He's going to be around for a long time to come. I guarantee it. Even if he leaves again, he will be back. The best thing you can do for you is not to get involved again.<br>  <br>  My sister was in a similar situation. My mom gave her the money to dovorce her abusive, lying pig of a husband, but my sister always took him back. This went on for 19 years, before she finally ended it for good. My parents couldn't stand him, but still welcomed him over for gatherings so they didn't alienate their daughter. My husband and I didn't like him either, but also put up with him. We didn't live with him and could ignore him for a few hours and leave.<br>  <br>  I have a cousin also in a similar situation. She divorced her husband, but he still has been in and out of the house ever since. This situation has been going on at least the last 10 years. My family has had enough and doesn't help her out anymore, BUT they still put up with him at family gatherings, because like it or not, it's her life, not theirs. and that is what you need to do...|`|6dQT8uM3aa	Counseling would be the answer, she needs counseling to assert herself and get out of an abusive relationship. You all need to participate in similar counseling since you can not detach from her, but eventually everyone has a life to live. your brother in law has to be driven out to seek counseling himself i do not believe he enjoys life as it is.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	You have to detach from the situation....as in learn not to care so much. It's not YOUR life. It's theirs. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. Your sister in law needs counseling. You should also get meds for anxiety if you don't already have them. (I take celexa which helps a lot). You can still have your sister in law and niece in your life, just learn to put aside what goes on in her private life because it's her business......and if she tries to vent......tell her she should really get a counselor. You can always change the subject too. As far as her husband, he's a loser and she's crazy to take him back, but again, that's her business. <br>  <br>  There's wackos in every family. Best policy is to treat them cordially, keep a distance, but don't make the children pay for their parents crazy behavior. You may be the only stability your niece will ever know!|`|eWMn7dhKaa	1) Stick to your guns and both (you and your husband's) viewpoints in this matter.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2) Do an about-face, rescind the letter and try to support your sister-in-law and her daughter.  Nowhere was it written that you have to have contact or relations with the ex-husband.  He doesn't need to be in your picture and should not affect your marriage.<br>  <br>  Those are about the only 2 real choices I see you having in this situation.  Do whichever one your family can live with, since they are priority #1.|`|uij93NOjaa	I believe by cutting her off,cold turkey, like what your doing is the only thing you can do. She will not learn by people giving her things and supporting her and taking her in. She is being a child in this situation. You and your husband are doing the right thing.<br>   Maybe you can talk to the family about this and they can do or, try and do the same thing you are. It's going to be very hard because it is family but, it truly is the best thing to do. When she realizes that family doesn't support her and there is nobody to cry to when he cheats, hits, and leaves.............I think there is a possibility she will cut him off.<br>   Another thing, I think a big part of her staying with him is being able to take her to daycare. So, if there is anyway for someone ( not the in-law) to take your niece to school that will be a big jump.<br>  Good luck, you and your family are in my thoughts and I really hope everything works out.|`|wwB3csfYaa	My sister is in the same situation. She lets him in the house knowing full well he'll hold her down and be abusive. I have no clue WHY??<br>  I am emotionally worried all the time. My husband and I decided to move 12 hours away because we can't stand it anymore. She even lives with us. So I'm sad but I believe moving on will help us and we can't be involved anymore|`|61a706a96992f304450dbded47628ddbaa	Never butt in someone else marriage. What God has brought together. By being there and listening you are doing the right thing. I understand that he is a total loser, an awful husband AND father. Guiding a person requires you to place your personal views aside. She will see him for who he is on her own, she probably already does. Pray for them and let God do the work, and remain a good friend and sister in law by continuing to be there for her. This does not mean you condone what he is doing, it means you love and care for her.<br>  <br>  By giving up on her, you are doing exactly what he hopes you'll do. Leave her without any support system so he can continue his abuse.|`|AA10243483	Why are there millions of people in the same boat? I understand you care  but seriously you need to step back and just let people make there own decisions. Right or wrong. You have already gave your opinion and showed love by being a supporter now its up to them . My mother and father allows my sisters husband to site at family dinners weeks after my sisters husband beats her .I can't understand it. All I know is when it comes to my house he is not welcomed at all and if my sister dont like it then so be it. I might not see my sister often but I know she knows deep down inside I love her and I'm letting her know I DONT LIKE IT.<br>  Take care of your family and if any man walked in my house and disrespected my husband he would never come through the door again but might go through it going out with a foot up his rump. Your Husband should not have to deal with someone else problems or be in his own home and get disrespected in no shape or form. You need to tell them all how you feel and that you dont agree and your not being part of it because its wrong. Find some friends or better yet do more with your family and they will come around.Your sister needs tough love and needs to grow up.|`|FFJeaHX5aa	I know a guy who knows a guy who can take care of this if u get my drift. <br>  <br>  People make mistakes and its hard to watch and not be able to do anything but move on and dont see them.|`|tGCtjWwqaa	NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT TYPE OF DISRESPECT.  THIS MAN SHOULD NOT EVEN BE AROUND YOU OR YOU FAMILY.  ONCE A CHEATER HE ALWAYS WILL BE.  HE RESPECTS NO ONE OR HIMSELF<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SWEET MILDERD SENT ME TO HELP YOU|`|tiPnWYHQaa	The bible says to forgive and forget. She needs you in her life. Weather you approve or disapprove of him. I think you should tell her that the only way you allow him to be around you is if he apology's and repays everyone that has help her out when he was going though the mess.
MejdEPF9aa	I would sit back and take a few deep breaths and remember why you split up in the first place, then wonder why on earth you want to go back over old ground. If he left, then he could do the same the second time around. I would have a long hard think, then if you want to answer his calls, wait for him, but don't wait too long, get yourself back out on the singles scene! Good luck!|`|QHpq3QpAaa	Why does everyone PLAY? What is wrong with just being real?|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Don't call/ text  him at all, just ignore him and live your life and be happy.  You might find after awhile that you don't even want him back. If he calls you be polite but not overly friendly/ familiar.|`|ze4Gt1araa	Yeah that's a good idea play hard to get.<br>  <br>  Don't text him and don't call him let him text you and call you. Make him want you so he can realize what he had since he lost it even though if you still like him don't make him feel special.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|ubdEwzcoaa	if he want you, don't get to cocky or to confident because than you might push him away by playing to hard. you might give him the assumption that your not interested.|`|8uvLG8Lbaa	why? <br>  besides, thats risky depending on what kind of person he is, and how he'd take it.<br>  i'd move on if a girl acted like she wasnt interested because im a serious person.|`|oYGtkVwOaa	it sounds like he already want you back so why would u have to play hard to get.|`|JgTQh90kaa	haha i feel exactly as you do girl!(:<br>  in my opinion,<br>  text him less, and just dont call him.<br>  if he wants you back, hell cal you and be the first to text you.<br>  <br>  dont text him first, wait til he texts you, so you wont look desperate. <br>  unless he's sick or something, then you can call.<br>  also,<br>  flirt with other guys,<br>  but dont be TOO big of a flirt, cause itll give him the wrong idea.<br>  <br>  also, show him youre having fun.<br>  never look sad in front of him.<br>  <br>  yes, i know you probably want to to make him feel bad,<br>  but trust me, it doesnt really work that great.<br>  <br>  ive had the same guy screw me over for the past 11 months of my life,<br>  so ive learned a lot!<br>  <br>  hopefully my tips will help!<br>  <br>  goodluck(:|`|MVJdwyIkaa	My guess is that you are not going to like my response! If you have to play hard to get then it isn't worth chasing after. If you have told him how you feel about him and he did nothing then save your self respect and move on down the road. I know it seems harsh but if you subject yourself to chasing after someone or trying to make them want you in the end you will regret ever doing so. I would have saved myself a lot of grief if I had taken that advise at your age. Good Luck!|`|B1COLthhaa	Well he already wants you back so I don't think you really need to play hard to get...just dont be the first to text him, have him text you first
jCdC5BUdaa	well first of all thanks for adding me.well us girls we need to protect  ourselves from from the boys,if you dont feel solace about it then dont.girl sometimes your gonna have to learn how to listen to that still small voice.sweety life is filled with temptations.please becareful with your decision makings.but if you really need to see himthen dont go to where he told you to meet him.ask to come and meet you in a very crouded place like malls and occasions.or if not ask hm if he could come over.thats if your prents are cool with it.that will show you that he really loves{NEVER EVER EVER.GO TO A PLACE WITH HIM ALONE}take care holler|`|AA11724052	He appears to be overly anxious to meet you. I don't know how old you are, but I would be very leery of the sexual predators that prowl the internet looking for victims. You might test him by telling him that you would need have your father drive you over for the meet. His reaction should tell volumes about his intent.
237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	I 100% agree with Tricia T. She is dead on. I understand as well the feelings that you are experiencing. I know you feel petty, and somewhat you are, but we all are petty a time or two. We are only humans! <br>  <br>       I think the entire thing is boiled down to the fact that you wish that you were engaged, but are not. I get that. ( I have been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years and still no ring) You find yourself in an odd place, and you are feeling these feelings of sadness and are being down on yourself when there is no reason for it. I think you are upset about not being in the weddings is bc if you can't have your own wedding your wanting to be part of someone else's wedding. As a short term fix of your wedding blues. But trust me, you are so lucky to not have to deal with other peoples weddings or especially be a bridesmaid. Girl,  I just bought my 12th bridesmaid dress (I'm only 25)  Trust me,  as the proffessional bridesmaid, it's overrattted!<br>     <br>  You need to focus on other things. I know you want to be married, and it will happen one day. But you should focus on just making the relationship even as just a girlfriend the best one you can make it. Just be glad to have a man that loves you and says he wants to marry you. That should be enough for now. If  you can't keep your mind off the wedding blues, take up a hobby or take some classes. Something to keep your mind off the petty things. Life is too short.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	You are "going against the flow." Listen, I got engaged to my wife last year without a ring. I had no money for a ring. We became pregnant a month later and you can pretty much imagine how THAT caused some financial stress. We saved what little we could and bought a set of wedding bands at Sam's Club for a TOTAL price of $378.00. We went to the Justice of the Peace and the liscense, ceremony, copies, and fees cost us $90.00. All together our wedding cost under $500. Oh, right now we have over $6,000.00 in savings and every penny can be invested in our daughter. Are you being petty? I don't know. It depends on where your priorities lay. I think you are making a mountain out of a mole hill. Take a deep breath, step back, and ask yourself what is REALLY important in the grand sceme of things.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	You can't help the way you feel, all you can do is control the way you handle theses things and the way you react to it. Choose your bridal party as if they had never gotten married. If they hadn't, would you want them with you on the big day? if so, have them in it. Maybe they just had a ton of other people to choose from that they were a little bit closer to, or they had known them longer, etc. Don't stress about it.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	The first responder said it best.  You can't help how you feel, only how you respond to those feelings.  If that's how you feel, that's how you feel.  There's no point in beating yourself up about it.  Honestly, I would be feeling the same way in those situations.<br>  <br>  As far as who to have in the bridal party, you need to do what's right for you.  You really don't need any bridal party at all, let alone multiple women standing up there with you.  If you don't want to include them, you definitely don't have to.  Just make sure it's what you truly want for yourself.  Are you sure you're not going to feel cheated out of the experience of having a larger bridal party if you don't include them?<br>  <br>  I went through a similar dilemma.  The people we wanted as our maid-of-honor and best man had not chosen us to be the maid-of-honor or best man when they'd gotten married.  I had felt hurt that we had been slighted in those instances, and wondered if it wouldn't be better to give the honor to somebody else since we didn't owe it to either of them.  In the end, we decided to have them as maid-of-honor and best man anyway.  Looking back, choosing them was the right decision for our situation, and I don't regret the decision we made.|`|meKSppblaa	No. I don't think you are being stupid. Maybe they did not realize you wanted to be a bridesmaid.Or they could just be being bitchy.|`|AA11380378	Oh, for Pete's sake, grow up. <br>  <br>  His cousins and sisters owe you nothing and they are not obligated to include you in the wedding festivities reserved for the bridal party, because you were not in it. Get over yourself, can people be close to their own friends??? <br>  <br>  Envy is a bad counselor and jealousy will guarrantee perpetual unhappiness.<br>  <br>  Is not all about you, ya know?<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  PS/ Being jealous of a broke couple that had a cheap ring on layaway for years??? Geez.|`|cGbTJobeaa	You are not stupid or petty for feeling this way.  It's natural to have those feelings.  It's emotionally difficult to be with someone you love and want to get married to them and not have it progress.  I have had that pain before and it HURTS.  Being in that situation, it is so hard to be around other people who are getting married when you aren't.<br>  <br>  Your bf's sisters like you. However, they are treating you like "just a gf" and not "fiance or wife" because that's what you are.  You were invited to the showers as a courtesy because you are the gf.  Don't take it personally because it was not meant that way. It just is.<br>  <br>  You were not invited to the bachelorette party because it was limited to the wedding party, family and the bride's friends.  You are not the bride's friend. You are an acquaintance friend of hers and not one of her people. If you and your bf went your separate ways, you would never see the sister again.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	You are waiting to get it done right and you are seeing other people do it anyhow. Just think of how much better your wedding will be because you waited. Maybe start putting a little money aside every month just to get there. If you already are, great job! Being jealous is a natural thing, but don't let it run your life. You will get there.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are more hurt than anything. When the time comes and they are still rude to you, then don't have them in your wedding. Or have them as seaters or another small job.<br>  <br>  That was a little rude to take you shopping then talk to her friends like you where invisible. Just because you are in laws doesn't mean you are close.

What I mean is this: Friends, over time, make lots of deposits into this "bank account": Doing favors for you, being there for you, etc. Then this withdrawal comes: They let you down one time.

LRJmHA7vaa	Wow, thats a real problem. I am assuming that you have spoken to your wife about this. Unfortunately, most of us Moms will back our children over a man any day. This being said, if you truly love your wife, then maybe you and your step son could sit down together an make a plan. One that will have him on his feet and on his own in a timely manner. If they refuse or don't hold up to there end of the bargain. Then leave. Its a tough situation no matter what.|`|eJIucizyaa	I gather from your details that your relationship might be the best.I feel that you should be supporting one another and not a deadbeat.I am assuming that her son is twenty one.I think that there might be a lot of resentment towards you for trying to correct him. <br>  Most of the answers that I have heard from younger people is I am eighteen I can do as I want.That shows you how darn smart they really are.<br>  You and your need to see a counselor and you and her need to work things out first.She needs to put her foot down and tell him like it is because there are three more to go and it can get worse.|`|AA11797994	Here's an interesting article you may be able to relate to:<br>  <br>  <br>  DEAR ABBY: I am living with a great guy. "Phil" is a sweetheart. He has two nice kids, a good job and we are talking about marriage. We travel, have fun and I have never been happier.<br>  Here's my problem: My son, "Danny," a college senior, will most likely need to move back home in May. I love him, but I must admit he is self-centered, depressing and uncooperative. I suppose much of it is his father's and my fault. <br>  Phil does not want Danny to move in after graduation. He feels the decision is not about choosing between him and my son, but about choosing between my son and me.<br>  I can envision a wonderful future with Phil, but I can't imagine telling my son that he is on his own. My heart tells me I'm a mother first and must provide for my son no matter what. In the back of my mind I suspect that if I don't, I'll regret it forever. I see no middle ground. Can you? -- CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE<br>  <br>  DEAR IN THE MIDDLE: The first thing that comes to mind is that Danny should move in with his father. If that is not feasible, then you, Phil and Danny must sit down together and talk like adults. <br>  <br>  You stated that you live with Phil -- not the other way around. If it is Phil's house, he is under no obligation to have your son as a long-term houseguest. If he does agree, he has a right to know that Danny will be there under certain conditions, for a limited period of time and have it in writing. <br>  <br>  Among today's realities is the fact that the job market is difficult, and not all college graduates are able to find jobs in their chosen fields. A certain amount of compromise will be necessary on all your parts.

When she needs a hug or someone to talk to be that someone. The girl that I am friends with is actaully older than me so she doesn't think she can tell me these things yet I know them anyways because our mom's are best friends. Anyways I am sorry I can't give you the best advice because I myself am not sure what to do. But like I said when she wants to talk to you be there. Show her you care about her.

Her physical abuse and abortions has really affected her mentally.  I think because of her past experience, her mother doesn't understand your friend and behaving in this manner.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if it possible for someone professional doctor/school counsellor who can speak to her family about their daughter's mental state.<br>  <br>  I take it that you are in America.  Is there any charity organisations or agencies, who take in physically and emotional abused girls?  Because this would be the best choice she has.<br>  <br>  If possible, do you think your parents will accept her to stay with you?<br>  <br>  I am really sorry to hear about her.  I hope she finds a way out of this.
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I'm not really sure what to say here.  I mean he proposed and right afterwards was cheating.  He then broke up with you when he realized you weren't the type that would take his cheating.  STOP TALKING TO HIM.  He should have no place in your life.  I know there are different rules for friendship and relationship but after being engaged I just don't think it's possible to become friends especially with a cheater.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't take him back and he is viciously trying to hurt you.  Consider yourself lucky to have found out this cruel streak before you said I do.<br>  <br>  As you said you know he is lying.  You don't want him back and plan to move on.  But you'll have to realize that you will NEVER have understanding.  He will never be honest and you will never really know what was inside his head.<br>  <br>  But if you continue to talk to him you will discover he will continue to say vicious things with the sole purpose of hurting you.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	that's right, move on and forget him.  give him back the ring and have his # blocked from your cell.  don't answer or read his texts or emails anymore, and don't take his calls.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	He's just backpedaling and trying to move your focus away from him and onto your cousin. My advice would be to stop responding to him completely.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Maybe he is trying to stir the pot a little and have your anger drected towards someone besides him.

Remind him that he has no business calling or texting you anymore.<br>  <br>  After that, cut him off completely even if he continues to try to contact you. Pretend he doesn't exist, and find someone who will cherish you <br>  <br>  Good luck and stay strong!|`|QrSFskUpaa	He is trying to give you reasons why you should trust him (because he did not sleep with your cousins and he loved you). If he really loved you, he would not cheat on you, especially when you guys are planning the wedding. See the good sides is that you did not get married with a liar, a cheater and did not spend money on the wedding. Go celebrate your "celibat" with your friends!|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	He's trying to make himself seem credible again by saying "oh so someone tried to sleep with me but just so you know I said no because I'm a good guy!".  What a joke.  I'm glad you're going to move on because this guy's a real jerk.  At least you found this out before the wedding!|`|EfuT8y4Gaa	I would leave him...change your number and forget about him...he doesn't deserve you..you can do better|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	He is just proving that he is a bad person. I am really sorry that you have had to go thru this, but I am so grateful that you were able to get out of it before you were more committed. Imagine if you had kids with the man! He is obviously no good and has some serious issues that need to be tackled. But it's not your problem anymore. I commend you for knowing to move on from this jerk. You deserve so much more and one day you will get that. Just keep on reminding yourself that you are a strong beautiful woman that deserves the best! Good things do happen to good people, just sometimes we hit a few bumps or come across some toads. He has what is coming to him, trust me. Karma's a *****. Keep your head high girlie. Keep yourself surrounded by good family and friends and it will make this easier for you. Good luck hun.|`|AA11865280	You desire understanding? A girl had been telling me for a whole year that she loved me, would marry me at any moment, would never cheat on me and then I did not hear from her for 2 days after talking to her for over a year. So I text her and asked her was she alright and then I said, "either you have been with another guy, you like another guy, or your telephone is broke." Then I said, "is this true?" Her response was, "yes I'm engaged!" Can you believe that? Unbelievable! I deleted all contact information with her except my e mail address, changed all my numbers and then when I got back home last night she had sent me an e mail saying "I need you, you're still a friend, right? I know I just lost 2 of the best things that have ever come into my life, you and (a person who just passed last night)" and then she left her number for me to call her. I have not called her, I kind of want to text her but then she will have my number again. I do care for her, but I keep thinking about how she LIED FOR A WHOLE YEAR!. I may eventually reestablish contact with her because to be honest I don't even think she is engaged. To me, if she was, why would she call upon me? Her fiance would be the man to call upon now, right?|`|Mkn6vYO0aa	He's a loser! and a liar obviously!! Trust your instinctss hunny. And if you recall the text message, at the end he said he LOVED you do you see the (ED). He obviously doesn't care about you if he had to lie and say he was at work meetings. And if you don't believe your cousin would do something like that, ask her and find out. But don't really ask her, play it off and be like " blah blah blah, told me wat you did that week we went out of town with you guys. And see how she reacts. Just play it off and be like "Don't lie to me, he told me everything. Id she looks like she really doesn't know what your talking about then he was lying.|`|UM9LlPWDaa	I agree. It doesn't sound like he is getting cold feet about the wedding. Sounds more like he just doesn't want to settle down. He is diverting your attention to your cousin thinking he can distract you long enough to get back in. If he didn't contact you for 4 days and then said that I would assume he could care less...<br>  <br>  You deserve better! Good for you for not begging him to come back to you and for being the strong one in the relationship.
JhvqUvlsaa	I think you might have to let her go; it sounds like she is obeying her mom's wishes to stay away from you. I do not think your mom talking to her mom about marriage is the answer; I think you should let her live her life and find someone who is free to love you without their parent or someone else interfering. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck; I hope this answers your question.

I'm honest when I do, though, and if I can, I will say what I think of them to their face. <br>  <br>  Anyone I have ever talked about was exactly what I said they were. The ones who refuse to believe they're as stupid as I said they were are always the first to backstab me. I had a similar thing happen to me before, and it always involved the same person talking to different people. I don't let it get to me anymore. I just test my friends because they should know how I really am. You have to be prepared for disappointment, though. <br>  <br>  you do not always become a victim. Some people are great at staying on top of their game, and if you stick with most of the same people all the time, you'll see who they are. People do it because they like to cause problems. If you have ever noticed, many times the person is being talked about is the only one who loses something. If I were to talk bad about you and get caught, lose friends and anything else I care for, this would make me not wanna do it again, but the fact is that most people do it because they know they'll still have friends and credibility. It's just a matter of knowing who to mess with. <br>  <br>  I say, when you have friends, make sure they know that you don't want any drama. If you're in high school, this is tough, but if you're an adult and still having these problems, there has to be someone in your life that needs to be thrown out as soon as possible.|`|f1TXfTMVaa	Everyone talks about people behind their back. I do, but then realize I did, then it comes back and bites me in the butt. We gossip because it makes us feel like we are better than the person we are talking about. Also we gossip for another reason too. For example you are sitting at lunch and the people you are sitting with are talking about trash about your friend, then you are under the pressure to talk trash about your friend too. So you do. Then your friend finds out and she is now mad at you. Do you see what gossiping does? It leads you into the wrong group of friends.|`|d222d3f47043def4bb4ae3e895ef58c1aa	i did gossip but never backstab... 2 different things|`|xtg4nFeEaa	I see it like this that people are always gonna talk bad about eachother and backstab one another. I'll admit that I have said some messed up stuff about people. But, it was only the truth and unlike other people after I feel bad sometimes or I go up to them and say it to their face :) I'm a very blunt person and backstab no that's just stupid to me. I have been backstabed by many people in my life. It hurts especially when you thought you could trust that person with EVERYTHING. Just that's how people are but, in a way it's good. You learn who you can and cant trust.
vHxauOyeaa	watch lez porn, be faithful. <br>  It is good to explore, but your time has passed. <br>  I'm just saying this because it sounds like you should respect your husband... that is what marriage is for after all.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	You are MARRIED. You should not be interested in anyone else but your husband. If you go "experimenting" you will be cheating on your husband. It isn't fair to him. You should have thought about this BEFORE you got married. Don't do anything. If you really want to, divorce your husband so he can find someone who truly cares about him.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Wow.. you certainly are in a tough spot. If you were bisexual- meaning that you were certain that you had equal attraction and affection for both men and women- then I might think differently because then your husband (unless you hid this part of you) would had to have accepted that part of you in accepting you, as my husband did with me. When I met him, I already knew that I was bi so there was no curiousity I needed to fulfill. There was no stepping outside of him to satisfy that curiousity (as you're trying to do) and then stepping back into my marriage in case I found that I didn't like bisexuality. It would even be wrong to think about it because you didn't marry your match, so you couldn't even discuss it with him, if you wanted to. With him being old fashioned, that means you literally have to bury the curiousity inside you because it goes outside of what he would agree with. That's not his fault. It's more so your fault for marrying an old fashioned man, when you're not. That is a situation that, to me, is a receipe for disaster. Even in marriages where the two are swingers, everything is based on agreement, so you don't even have that in your favor.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you may be more emotionally connected to women than sexually connected, it would be best to end the marriage anyway because no matter who the man was, you'd still feel unfulfilled. So, this isn't even about your husband as much as it's about you knowing and accepting yourself. You owe it to your husband to either discover yourself honestly and put an end to the marriage or (if its just a sexual thing) to tell your husband where he's not satisfying you and what it is about a woman that makes you think you'd enjoy her sexually. I belong in the latter group and my husband has always known it.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Should of married someone more sexually adventurous, you're stuck.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Its still adultery.<br>  <br>  Geez, the moral fabric of society has gone down hill and FAST!|`|4HoVVCenaa	You may want to just experiment in your mind.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	If your husband were bi curious, what would you suggest he do? Would you feel like you aren't fulfilling his needs? Would you feel jealous? I'm sure the feelings you would have would be the same as if he wanted to cheat with someone of the opposite sex. That being said, once a person goes there (being unfaithful, even if she/he refer to it as experimenting), there's no taking it back and the guilt lives with her/him for the rest of her/his life, so really think about what the consequences would be. <br>  <br>  You really aren't missing anything, but if you keep thinking about possibly being bi, you are better off getting a divorce and figuring out who you are before you commit to someone new (male or female)...because you aren't going to convince your husband to be cool with it and cheating on him would be wrong and would make you feel like crap about yourself.|`|6dQT8uM3aa	go to craiglist.com you'll find a lot of people in the same situation looking for a friend with whom to find relief. don't feel bad about experimenting or fulfilling needs that your husband can not meet,  just make sure to be be aware of what you really want so you don't hurt no one or put yourself in a difficult situation.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	You should do nothing...if you did while you are married it will be cheating. If it's really that important to you, you'll eventually divorce and try it out...or you'll cheat, get found out and divorce...either way if you really want to explore this, you're looking at splitting up.|`|X3MVUemWaa	You made a commitment to him so just drop it. People have curiosities, urges etc BUT it does not mean you act on them. You took wedding vows so that means your focus is your husband and making it a good marriage. <br>   It is called self control and keeping your promise.|`|krQiDGCHaa	You don't experiment.  You're married.<br>  <br>  Being bisexual is a license to find members of both sexes attractive.<br>  <br>  It is NOT a license to cheat on your spouse.  Same sex is still cheating.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	He thinks it's wrong and considers it cheating, as should you.<br>  How bout just renting some girl on girl flicks?|`|BMEMH7JLaa	You have a good husband honor his wishes or leave him.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Watch Bi-porn.|`|4WZzPKXvaa	Well, one of the people that have answered here already does have a point.  Being Bi-curious means that you do have attraction for your opposite sex as well as your same sex but doesn't mean you should cheat on your husband.  Even if it with the same sex, it is still cheating.  <br>  <br>  I am a lesbian and I personally don't think there is such thing as Bi-curious.  You are either bisexual or homosexual.  Some consider their selves to be pan-sexual and asexual, but that is a different story.  Everyone is born that way, some just take longer to realize it, in your case.  First off if you really do want to experiment, just talk to your husband about it.  I understand he can be old fashion but he can't be immature about it so talk to him.  I don't mean like randomly bring it up, I mean like sit down with him and take some time out to just talk about this.  Maybe at night when you're both in bed or something.  <br>  <br>  If he agrees on you experimenting with other girls then go for it.  Some guys don't consider this cheating and actually consider this really hot so even if he's old fashion, bring it up and who knows.  I still consider it cheating, but technically cheating would be if you're husband doesn't know and if he does know bothers him.  Cheating is tricking, but if he knows and is comfortable with it then it's not cheating.  Some Couples go into orgies of many people and stuff.  <br>  <br>  If you no longer have feelings of ryour spouse then just cut it, if you want to keep looking and checking out other people than include girls.  Don't break his heart.  For how long have you been married with him and how good is this relationship.  I would recommend you this movie<br>  <br>  "Imagine me and you"  <br>  <br>  Has a lot to do with what you're goign through so check it out.  Watch it.  I have to go to class.|`|2j2C44FDaa	If you knew for a while that you want to experiment, it would be unfair to your husband to have married him. Just because people "want" something in life, doesn't mean they always have to act upon it. If you love your husband you have to compromise, if you go out and experiment with someone else without him knowing, it is cheating you know.<br>  If you are so desperate and your husband doesn't agree, you have to think about what is more important, your marriage or your fancies.<br>  You owe it to your husband to be honest and if he bores you so much then don't drag him along. <br>  However try and compromise first, explain to him, ask him how he would feel if you had a one night stand with a girl. Its called communication. If he still doesn't want to know you have to decide.<br>  Fancy or divorce.|`|fOZTNTLnaa	my sister's girlfriend's name is andy. she was married before my sister. her and my sister hit it off and have been together for 2 years now. andy's husband wasn't too happy about it. <br>  try talking to your husband. <br>  maybe you two can "experiment" together. <br>  or if you really think you are then try kissing another female that you think is attractive.

He thought you were more serious and the type of person he wanted and maybe she's scorned because of that. <br>  <br>  It seems like he wanted you and he loves you.

What is the big benefit in knowing all the little details of his past relationships? It is simply meaningless to continue to badger anyone about information from a past relationship, the only thing you are doing is setting the stage for dysfunction in your marriage. And how did you expect your husband to respond? Not many men like to discuss their past relationships, as it is a bit awkward and judging by your personality, he might be fearful of telling the truth as you may blow up? Your best bet would be to close the door on his past, as it is not going to do you any favors with the here and now, today.|`|HamL63Dtaa	Dear friend.....I understand what u r going through....Now is the question...do u love ur husband? If yes then dont listen to crap told about him. See we also talk crap abt Bush, Obama etc. Does it affect them? Dear u r a really nice soul. Trust HIM...and life will be amazing for u. And please, if the ex tells u again anything....tell her...its none of ur matter....and just get lost...dear u need to be mentally tough just like Joan of Arc....trust me ur husband really lovez u....start trusting him...Saw the love story in Slumdog Millionaire??? Make ur love story like that...bye dear. tc.|`|MYU46ap5aa	His ex is not your friend so don't give into what she says or writes.  Since he won't leave you because he LOVES YOU (not her) she's trying to find a way to make you feel insecure and leave your husband so she can try to pick up the pieces.<br>  <br>  Convince your husand to get an order of protection against her so she has to stop contacting you/him.  She's crazy.|`|AA12048821	tell him that you dont care whther it is serious or fun...you just dont like this and that this has to stop once and for all. <br>  <br>  as for helping you, you have to decide what to do..you can contact this girl and tell her to stop contacting your husband too but hubby may not like that|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Its not based on lies. He love you and wants to be with you. He left her obviously because he found the love of his life, and no matter how he felt about her, he couldn't help the fact that he found his soul mate. Maybe you should appreciate him.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Easy! We all had lives before we got married. What does it really matter that your husband had a relationship before you? Apparently it's over. You can not hold this over his head.<br>  <br>  Check out my source.|`|AA10236778	He did marry you............it seems it's not important enough for him to dwell on.|`|doTbLM4Xaa	it's in the past, let it go|`|wRHhpanmaa	Perhaps she was more attached than he was, and being spiteful because you were the one who married him.  Don't let a jealous ex ruin a perfectly good marriage, if you are happy. It sounds like she is just jealous, and he is blowing it off because he knows how she can be. Don't read too much into this. It sounds to me that she is holding bitter resentment towards you for taking her man and marrying him. Some women are silly, they fall in and out of love on a whim. Maybe she "fell in love" but he didnt. Perhaps he didnt see her that way. Now, she is trying to get in the way of your marriage. He didnt want to say anything about her because he didnt want all this extra drama to ruin yalls relationship. Or perhaps he was single afterall and she is trying to start problems. Don't believe your husband's ex over your husband. Women can be the most conniving back stabbing people on this earth.  When they want something, they dont care who they have to hurt to get it. don't let your marriage be ruined because some stupid girl can't give up an ex boyfriend.|`|zzfCPTiQaa	He can feel like it was just for games, and she could consider him her first love.<br>  Love doesn't always have to be mutual.<br>  She may have had more feelings for him then he did for her.<br>  If he said he married you for a passport, he doesn't love you as much as you think.<br>  A marriage based on just getting a passport has NO foundation whatsoever.<br>  Not all marriages are like this though, maybe you should talk to him a little more about it.<br>  Normally if you feel as if he is lying, you are right.<br>  Think about whether you should put up with this or not?<br>  Whether you should respect yourself and not be lied to or not.<br>  Marriage and relationships in general should have lots of trust and it doesn't seem like this one does.<br>  What is love without trust?  NOTHING.|`|xGV0ooCHaa	Your right, Marriage is based on trust, not lies.  You need to start trusting your husband and leave these questions of doubt behind. We have all been in relationships where we felt we "loved" someone, but outgrew that relationship. He is with you because he loves you and he shouldn't have to explain a past relationship (that is why it is called past).  If you don't feel you can trust him, or these lying issues go deeper than this, then you should consider marriage counseling.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|d222d3f47043def4bb4ae3e895ef58c1aa	trust is the foundation of any relationship ... trust him now and let go of the past.|`|O3fcLsKMaa	Some people just don't explain past relationships.  I was in a relationship once with a guy who his ex kept calling him and accusing him of ruining her life.  She made all these accusations about what he did to her.  Some people are just crazy and can't let go.  <br>  <br>  The difference in my situation though is that my bf at the time told me about her.  I even talked to her myself and it was clear she was out of her mind.  The best you can do is casually and calmly bring it up and suggest that he stop being contact with this woman.|`|HctybHFvaa	because it's awkward
VaZGN8P9aa	You could always just do a simple party with a theme. Some theme ideas are:<br>  Lingerie Party<br>  Luau<br>  Casino<br>  Western<br>  Fiesta<br>  Mardi Gras<br>  80's style<br>  Red/kisses<br>  Naughty Princess<br>  Girl's Night Out<br>  <br>  I'm going to have a girls-night only sleep over with just my bridesmaids (4 of them) because two of them are out of towners. We are going to eat really good snacks and stuff, cook dinner (or go to a restaurant), and watch a bunch of romantic/wedding/funny movies. =) We aren't the partying types either, and one of my bridesmaids is 15 years old (groom's neice) and I want to involve her, so we think this will be a whole lot of clean fun. =)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sGP6s7uraa	You could do a slumber party.  First, go to a shop and each find the best pair of pjs you can.  Second, go to the store and buy all of her fave munchies.  Third, rent movies that really take you back and the ones you absolutely love.  Dress in your new pjs, eat the food and drinks and watch movies.  While you're out and about, have fun with it.  Bring board games, play truth or dare, paint each other's toe nails, do each other's makeup and hair.  Do all the kid stuff since you're about to "become an adult."|`|seU9VwIJaa	My bachlorette party is actually going to be a spa weekend. Have you considered anything like that? The bride will get pampered and nobody will care if you can't drink!<br>  Have fun!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Dinner and a theater show. Take her to her favorite fancy place or do pizza at home, whatever you prefer. Then go to a play or concert or musical or theater show. We had 2 pregnant bridesmaids and 1 who doesn't drink and we are not the partier type either. So we had pizza and junk at the bride's house and then drove into the city to see Cirque du Soleil, which the bride was talking about seeing forever! <br>  <br>  There are tons of options:<br>  - paintball<br>  - laser tag<br>  - girls stuff like spas or shopping<br>  - fancy dinner and dancing<br>  - county line dancing<br>  - sporting event (depends on season)<br>  - paint-your-own pottery studio session<br>  - concert<br>   Or a bunch of those things together!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KHwY8seCaa	you could rent a limo, and get a guide to take you to haunted places....if your in to that kind of thing a themed party. or  a pj party with the ladies Send each guest a small teddy bear with a veil made out of tulle attached to its head. Tie a string around the bear's arm or leg that has the bachelorette party invitation attached to it. Provide all the necessary details and whether or not you want each person to bring her own pillow.<br>  <br>  Another fun idea is to find children's invitations that are specifically for a sleepover party. After all, wasn't childhood where sleepover parties originated? Tell your guests to make sure to bring their favorite stuffed animal and a snack!|`|eRBn7orfaa	My sister was under-aged at her Bachelorette party too. We went to Dave and Busters and played games for awhile. It was fun and she was happy because everyone enjoyed themselves even though it was not traditional. <br>  <br>  Might also consider doing some type of spa day. It would be nice and relaxing for all.
gLH0gcXtaa	Tell her plainly that while you care about her, you don't like the negative drama between her and her ma. If she doesn't respect that about you, then take a break from this friendship for a month or so. Then she'll realize you are being real about it. Otherwise she'll take what you're saying for granted if you keep allowing her to cause all this drama. Don't worry. You're just being a good friend by temporarily separating yourself until she gets her act together. In the long run, you are helping her (and yourself) regain some sanity.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	Cut the ties. Drama sucks.
AA10684513	Well since I live in NM I can say, she has to be here 6 months in order to establish residency.  But if you want to make sure your daughter is in your life no matter what then I would go to the court where you live and file a parenting plan.  Not a divorce or seperation but it will make sure that you have visitation.  Good luck.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I'm not sure why you think filing for divorce would ensure your daughter will be in your life any more than waiting will. Your wife is already in another state. You can file for divorce, but all she has to say is she has nowhere else to live and she can't support herself so she needs to live out of state. your daughter will still be in NM. I think you need to work on trying to fix what went wrong instead of trying to get a one up in your divorce....I can almost guarantee filing for divorce won't bring you closer, it will alienate your wife even more and give her parents more fuel for their fire....|`|8NbpkRpEaa	Yes, she can take her to another state until your legally divorced and you get a the court order that states that the ex-wife cannot live more than 100 miles away from the biological father with your daughter. Even then -she can ignore it and you'd have to take her to court to get it enforced. So, all in all it will take you tons of money in lawyers and court costs to see this daughter. That's why most men just give up (like my brothers did). Then in the long run, the longer the daughter is away from you her mother and her mothers family will poison her against you and then when oppurtunity arises for you to see her she (your daughter) wont even want to visit you. She'll be scared of you because of the garbage lies they fed her  and because they always hated you and don't want to share her with you anyways.Sorry, that's just one senario. I hope  it don't happen to you, but I was just letting you know before you spend all this money and still wont be able to see that kid.|`|VAI6MtPIaa	Her parents have little say to whether they want you in their daughters or their granddaughters life. You are HER father and will always be her father. They can't do anything to change that-ever. You need to talk to your wife about all of this. Her parents could be putting things into her head to get her to believe things that aren't true about you. <br>  <br>  If you love your wife stay married. There isn't a reason for a divorce if you both love each other and want to remain together. Try a non-legal separation (a lot of states don't have separations anyway). If you don't think you can be with her anymore file for divorce and custody of the child.. maybe not full but partical that way she can't ever take your daughter away from you (or try to).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that you should sit down and explain this to your wife. She can take her to another state if the courts allow it. She can't just take her without your consent because that would be kidnapping.

qtlzdtMVaa	Yeah I'm the same. I've always liked older men, only because people my age are immature and stupid. <br>  <br>  I've always had a father figure in my life so...that has nothing to do with me I suppose.<br>  <br>  I'm not quite certain about what you want until you know yourself, but it might be because you want to be with someone who takes you very seriously and who would love you dearly etc, or what I said (top). GL =D|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	You could want this for any number of reasons, maturity plays a big part too. Or you could just be developing a thing for older guys. Its really a question for a therapist to answer. I suggest you do your best to resist doing this until your 18 or older and be careful, most older guys will just want to use you for sex. I’m sure that’s not what your after.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	it's the attraction that you have with a man, i don't think age really matter as long as you're both compatible for each other which keep the relationship fun and growth.  Respect each other in a relationship is the key to make the relationship last.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	As long as he's under 18, fine. Other than that, you are risking putting that older guy in jail.  <br>  <br>  Older guys normally want one thing from young girls - and if you want to give that to him - you need to think about your morals and self pride.  <br>  <br>  Older guys are always appealing.  But sometimes you have to do what's right (and legal) even if it's not what you WANT to do.|`|1c2ff0589d655a36a936d6af96fb7116aa	Older men tend to be more experienced about life, depending on how older you want , and consider this , since you are only 16 an older man may not want much to do with you because of your age. Why not trying to give yourself a few years to grow or become more mature. If you're looking for this guy to be with you and or for you like your dad , its rare. The worst thing you can do is compare these men to your father/|`|kFwv57j4aa	most girls want older guys|`|qd2Cauvwaa	Usually because you find the stability and maturity attractive
zkpEX8mvaa	Bottling up feelings is a serious thing that could lead to serious health issues. It is best to get your feelings out in the open. If you can't tell your friend your feelings in private it is OK to have other friends present.  As a matter of fact some people are helped by a public situation (think doctor phil, or oprah)
bO2rzfISaa	I've heard of judges ordering the non-criminal party to take the child to visit the criminal. However, that was in cases where the criminal would eventually get out, and presumably return to a relationship with the child. I suspect it would be different if the criminal wasn't ever going to get out, based on the choices he/she made.|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	He should be more concerned with protecting his cornhole in the showers.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|tGCtjWwqaa	The man has no rights since he commited murder.

5UDNR37raa	I am speaking from a woman's point of view who grew up with all brothers!  I would say you probably should not worry yourself so, (unless you have other reason to). Hopefully you trust your wife. Maybe you guys SHOULD go out together. Get a feel for what this guy is like. See if he has other intentions. Also, let your wife know how you feel about it(WITHOUT AGRUMENT OF COURSE). Take her out to dinner and discuss it. It ALWAYS work for me and my boyfriend of 3YRS. Don't try to control your wife, but do let her know that it bothers you, but you are glad that she is anxious to introduce you to her old friend.<br>  <br>  I think it is cute that you are Jealous, but don't let it get the best of you.|`|aQXgxTggaa	Yes.  SHe has told you about him and even wants you to meet him, she isn't doing anything behind your back.  You should meet him and give it a chance.  However, if after meeting him you are still not comfortable, you should talk to her about it and make it clear, and she should respect your feelings.  However, I think you are being a little insecure.|`|QilfSBfsaa	I don't think you need to worry about your wife as she's honest to you, but you need to watch her male friend as you don't know if he has any intention, the best way to do is to go with wife everytime they meet, if he really has a bad idea he will quit.|`|Z68zEZmmaa	Yes worry! If your giving her all the attention and love and intimacy she needs , Nothing will happen but, If your the kind of man that ignores her while watching the games and loves to notice other woman too , then be afraid and worry!

You already know that the two of you share the same good taste in women.  Build on that and make sure that your wife sees that she made the better choice.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Just relax and enjoy the club hopping. Maybe you can make a new female friend to text and e-mail regularly, and take to dinner. Then you can invite her and she how much she enjoys being on the other end of the equation.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	That she wants you to meet him shows she's hiding nothing.<br>  You should relax a little.<br>  When you meet him, say to him in front of your wife, that the situation made you feel uneasy.<br>  Point out that you don't mind their contact, so long as it remains totally platonic and above board.<br>  If just one time they try to go beyond those limits, they'll both witness a completely different side of you, then it'll be kick ***, big time.<br>  Look both of them in the eyes when you say this.<br>  Then offer them a drink.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	Do not be so insecure. Humans are social beings, even you have to socialize time to time, yes, with ppl who know your wife earlier than you. Go out with that buddy, be friendly, have some drink together, and at the and propose an other occasion to see each other. These "school friends' meetings", independently on the gender, start very franticly, because of the memories, but then the life returns to the everyday routines. Be happy with some mix up.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	You have every reason to worry about your wife and her high school friend. Your wife should not be wanting to see any high school friend and he should not be asking her out.

They crave male attention, and never want to put their past relationships where they belong, in the PAST.<br>  Only she knows her intentions, she could be showing you off, rubbing it in his face that she moved on. She might have unresolved feelings for him. If he is truly unimportant to her, she should have no problem putting him behind her. Just be rational, and explain to her that you are not comfortable with her spending time with him. Don't be accusatory or judgemental when you tell her this.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	If he was just a high school friend, then yes, you're being over the top. If he was a boyfriend, then they need to cut it out. <br>  <br>  Sounds like she doesn't have anything to hide though since you know about the possible lunch and the texts and emails....AND your'e invited to meet him.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Sounds like a chance to finally meet someone new.  You just may like the guy.  You might not.  You won't know if you don't meet him.  Your wife knows him, so he can't be all bad right?<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure your wife knew a lot of people in high school, I would be willing to bet that you did too!  Reunions are always kinda cool... kinda awkward... kinda crazy and kinda fun.<br>  <br>  Plus you may get some juicy information from this guy that may come in handy later.  ;)  j/k about that, but it COULD happen.|`|TZpFcx47aa	Dayum. Did that guy have no farking life before 2 weeks ago?? Geez. Tell him to get out of your wifes skirt. I say no way no how to the meeting in the club thing. He needs to back off. Texting, emailing, lunch, gimme a break. You arent being insecure. He is moving in on your woman dude. Put an end to that little reunion asap.|`|uij93NOjaa	Yes, maybe he's gay? You don't know how he will be  until you meet him. It's okay to get jealous a little because he is a mystery man. You should just be happy that your wife wants to introduce him to you.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Why are they emailing and texting? Makes no sense. Are you that stupid? Why are you ready to whip @zz. Your wife is the problem.|`|wwB3csfYaa	Until I read the part where she wants you to meet him, I was worried. <br>  Nope she want's you guys to meet so they aren't up to anything.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Tell her you're not comfortable with the idea of them hanging out alone or the 3 of you hanging out and she should understand/respect that.

Not a good idea.  <br>  Why don't you go with a small group of friends out to dinner and bowling, and then hang at a friend's house and rent some movies and eat some cake and popcorn.  Make it really casual, just a hangout.  It's the company that makes it fun.  It doesn't have to be St. Pat's night, you could save it to celebrate on a weekend night before your birthday or the weekend after it.

I hope that everything works out for the two of you.|`|AA11103493	Go for it, the worst that can happen is that she says no.  <br>  <br>  Just please be aware that long distance relationships often don't work, especially when people are going to uni for the first time.|`|448d8047868dad85a78f45806967142eaa	talk to her<br>  <br>  - schooling and all that actutally doesnt make much difference..|`|MVJdwyIkaa	John, Seriously!!! if you want this girl then step up to the plate! You need to change some things about yourself. My brother in law was dating a girl in high school and she went on to a major university and he went to a party college and all he did the first year was party!! she let him know real quick if he didn't get his grades up and grow up that she would end it with him. So, needless to say he did and graduated with honers and now owns several fast food restaurants and they have three awesome children who are extremely driven as well! Do this for yourself and if you want her make yourself worthy! Good Luck to you, make a good choice your life will be much better for it! You can do it.|`|lymCWLcaaa	Your obviously smart...yeah u didnt solve any algebraic equations in that question but im a good judge of character and i can tell from that question that u put alot of thought into life...making u clever!! Try giving her a compliment say she's "hardworking, smart,cute pretty" just like wat u said and see how she takes it..smart girls like to be told thr smart!! i dont like datin "stupid" guys but it never has anything to do with thr grades i just want them to be able to hold an interesting convo!! if she takes the compliment well and doesnt have to ironically go soon after u compliment her...then ask her to go somewhere with u ....cinema or something|`|rj004nrlaa	Hay John,<br>  <br>  Just because you don't have high grades doesn't mean you're not good enough for this girl. If you like her then go for it. Whats the worst that can happen, she says no! well then you've lost nothing and you wont spend your time wondering 'what if' and if she say's yes, well then your sorted.<br>  <br>  Take a deep breath, suck it up, man up and go for it. You have to put yourself out there and take a risk every now and then.
g2QUNwZzaa	say no. its not that hard. im a guy. i get rejected all the time. WAY more times than i succeed. we expect it sort of. the thing is though ppl in high school think its the end of the world if that person they have a crush on rejects them, that they will never feel like that about anyone else ever in the world. but its not true. you will. hey ill admit i was guilty of the same thing not even 2 years ago. (slighty different situation, we actually dated but then she broke up with me) but i realize that i was stupid at the time|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	You say no! Why is this so difficult to figure out? If you are not interested in him do not waste his time or yours. Simple!|`|FHi0v36eaa	Say no! Don't lead him on by saying yes and then break his heart! That would be a horrible thing to do. Just say that you are flattered but that you don't feel the same way. Its better to do that then to go out with him and make him think you feel the same way when really you don't.|`|cHF1PwRdaa	You don't have to be in love to just go out with a guy.

No matter what you say, rejection is pretty harsh but you don't have to make it worse than it is.  Just tell him you enjoy being on your own right now.  Or tell him that his friend had asked you out and it would be too awkward to go out with him since that happened.|`|QvxzEjoZaa	say no  i understand that you want to be nice but but do you really beleive that you rejecting him is just going to devastate him ? Not that you're not a wonderful/terrific person but if he gets really upset over that it's not really about you. It's more of an insecuirty, which is his problem not yours.|`|n0jJc7hFaa	i would of course reply im not interested in u as more then a friend im sorry, i dont like you in that way and i hope you understand.<br>  <br>  thats it..nothing mor, because if they realli liked you they wouldnt mind at all just being friends.<br>  <br>  when a guy takes the chance in asking you out they are ready for rejection..so dw. do what u have to do.<br>  <br>  X]|`|FB1zwZkMaa	You have every right to say no.

You said it yourself she just broke up with her boyfriend. You gotta give her time because right now all she needs and seems to want is a friend. The fact that you two talk at school and online shows that she likes you but not on that level yet. So you need to give her time and become her friend. If you  keep asking her all that is going to happen is exactly what she said, which is that shes going to end up hating because she wants you as a friend right now and all you keep doing is asking her out.

That's probably not what you want to hear but it's true.  There are different types of personalities and some personalities like predictability and some don't.  <br>  <br>  Take me for example, I am a type A personality which makes me VERY unpredictable this being the case I needed a predictable person in order to keep me grounded and routine to a degree.  <br>  <br>  Being predictable is neither good nor bad.  The trick is to find a person who needs a little predictability in their otherwise unpredictable life.  It's a match made in heaven.|`|JFJF3GPWaa	It depend on the situation and the person.<br>  <br>  |Sometimes boys prefer the unpredictable type because it keeps them guessing and they find it exciting because they never know whats gunna happen next. Some friends prefer unpredictable especially if there go out every night and party people.<br>  <br>  But sometimes boys and girls prefer predictable because they always know where they stand with you, they know they can trust and count on you always being there.<br>  <br>  So it really depends on you opinion but i think a bit of each is probably best lol<br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|aSih8i3Caa	Bad.<br>  <br>  No one wants a person with zero fire or passion to them! Being unpredictable is sexy, guys never know what hit them! You're obviously more exciting in the bedroom if you're unpredictable, and every aspect of you will keep people excited about you, and interested.<br>  <br>  Being predictable is only good when it comes to keeping inside deadlines,lol!|`|1OzuuDcpaa	Well it depends on what your partner likes lol. I am extremely unpredictable and my girlfriend loves it! She says it keeps things original and fun.<br>  <br>  But that's just my girlfriend. I know other people who can't stand spontaneity. My friend is the real quiet type and her boyfriend is just like me - unpredictable, loud, spontaneous, wild, etc lol. They both love each other very much, but my friend gets annoyed with her boyfriend alot because she personally likes peace, comfort, and security. You know what I mean?<br>  <br>  But by no means does that mean you should change yourself for any guy! Just be yourself, and I promise you will attract a guy that likes your attitude whether you are predictable or unpredictable lol!|`|3g9Sq0ICaa	I personally don't like predictable people. It just takes away any mystery, it's less interesting, exciting. If you're talking about friendship I guess it's OK, but in romance predictable is kinda boring. Sorry if I disappointed you.|`|07c9c8887a2079668fc6b70291da5a98aa	it really depends on the situation example of good is that someone is trying to get you to figure something out bad would be a surprise for you and someone wanted you to just be surprised.  you know! be spontaneous!|`|unHX8Oyraa	it is normally used in a negative way|`|uA4tJuZbaa	Nope|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Not very good, like Yahoo predictibly messing up again today.

R5sMFDRoaa	If she doesn't feel the same about you, it very well might make her feel uncomfortable. She might worry that the things she says or does will lead you on or she may think you're constantly trying to pick her up. If you guys have been friends for a while, telling her you like her could change the entire structure of your relationship. <br>  <br>  But, if she feels the same way, you could finally take your relationship further. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would tell her how I felt and see where things go from there. Girls appreciate honesty. Just make sure, no matter what, you openly communicate with her. That way, if she doesn't reciprocate your feelings you can both come to some agreement about where your relationship stands.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3g9Sq0ICaa	If she is shy then she will certainly feel uncomfortable. If she's not then it's perfect, just tell her! Of course you understand that even though you will feel more comfortable around her if you didn't have to hide it from her all the time, your relationship with her will change.|`|1e8PheFkaa	I say tell her. At least it would make you feal better and maybe she will feal the same. At the minimum you would feal better right?

1tx9PvzJaa	It means that she doesn't want you as her friend. Try to be more understanding. She only looks at you as mother not a best friend|`|CrdMxdIKaa	Kids say the darnest things. I agree. Your child is probably upset at you for something recent. I would just ignore it this one time (as harsh as that sounds). Kids usually don't mean what they say.

My sister was the same way to my mom and now that she is going away to college, she is my moms best friend.|`|yQCg9Kemaa	She needs counseling.. and the best person who can counsel her is YOU!!  she might detest talking to u so what u can do is leave a note in her bedroom writing how u felt hurt and how much u love her and want her to understand u.. ask her for friendship... there are times when u have to change role and act like a friend rather than a mom !|`|vkYlr8oNaa	hahah! dont worry!<br>  my lil neice told her mommy yesterday this:<br>  mom: Emmerson i want you to make good choices at preschool today.<br>  emmerson: No mommy, i dont feel like it today, thank you thouu.!<br>  <br>  it was soo funny! shes a kid she doesnt mean it!|`|rqASGeevaa	Don't worry, if she's a teenager she's probably just being stroppy. Either way when she is older she'll be more respectful.|`|Xo4sQVbraa	Tell her to L2English|`|645b253bfedbc612cd086feab9c1be89aa	huh.|`|BImAj5WIaa	HUH you you make no sense woman|`|JqA5x1qiaa	u make no sense.|`|vXa7IeDiaa	maybe she thinks ur just going to ur friends house just to drink their coffee..|`|AA12041870	You are a successful parent if your child is hating you right now.  Don't worry.  The older she gets, the more she will need you.|`|jgedIY8taa	Kids in an attempt to appear independent, flip, wise, resolute, clever, or any number of other things, will often say things that are inappropriate, hurtful, stupid (and SOMETIMES even wise and clever).  Don't let it bug you.  I would have suggested saying something like "Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Sweetheart...I hope you change your mind someday." and then LET IT GO.  Part of why kids say things like that is to also get a rise out of you, and when you ignore the bait, you give them some small example of what it means to be an "adult."|`|cB2VGhLgaa	You should be happy she's just drinking coffee. But really, I hate parents who can't control their kids. They are usually the ones w/ the biggest brats for kids, and it is your own fault. You have to put your foot down.|`|pZVEBEmLaa	Are you giving her enough attention?|`|ib00OjJXaa	how old is she? lol<br>  <br>  kids will be kids<br>  and say nonsense sometimes|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	I think it's pretty clear what it means. She says that she doesn't want to be your friend when she gets older. Now don't be too upset about this. She was probably just mad about something and wanted to hurt your feelings. My mom wasn't around when I was growing up, but my dad was and I have said many hurtful things to him when I was young and living with him. If you would have told me when I was 13-16 years old that I would eventually like my dad and be good friends with him, I would have laughed in your face. When you're young, you can't see where your parents are coming from when they punish you, etc. But it's a part of getting older and realizing that your parents were just looking out for your well being. Don't be too upset. Just give it a couple years|`|SSeWnDPkaa	She probably heard someone say something similar whether it was from TV or real life and is just copying the cadence and tone because it amused her.  No need to worry.|`|GqTSa85daa	Not to worry, she'll come around and won't even realize it happening.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It means she does not like you much.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	I think she's mad at you for something and she wants to hurt your feelings|`|yyIVrngcaa	means she doesn't feel as close to you as she should..|`|qeLikL8Haa	she just wants to talk later|`|Xtqq71KGaa	sounds pretty childish.  how old is she?
1Y0yPiSvaa	Yes, you have to have some sort of proof as to his drug use. If you can prove to the court that your ex is an avid drug user then they will probably make him go to rehab before granting him any visitation rights. I must warn you though that these cases usually drag out and are very expensive. It sounds like your ex would not be able to afford this unless he represents himself. In any case, if you fear him then I would start with a restraining order.|`|mpcbHTDRaa	you would and you should explain how unfit he is but allow him visitation rights maybe seeing the child he's missing will make him wanna change if not, he's a person that cant be changed|`|50c48696b7488dc525798f3a4b51347daa	This is more a legal question but having worked with cases like this, most of the time the drug addicted father doesn't care about his kids.  If he does fight it, then do bring up his addictions and your concerns so that visitation rights can be negotiated accordingly.  You would have to prove him unfit for shared custody and you would want to check with a lawyer in your state to find out the laws about that.  Typically when the child is an infant, the infant stays with the mother because of the bonding and there is typically no overnight visits.<br>  <br>  If he does get custody, which I doubt, then yes, you would have to pay child support.  If you keep custody however, no matter what his income is in relationship to yours, you can still get child support from him.|`|AA10353286	If he doesn't get custody, you should at least take him VERY regularly to see his children when he isn't high. <br>  <br>  You are the one who got pregnant by a drug addict, so you are no more "fit" than he is. Those are his children just as equally as yours and you have no right to have had sex with a drug addict, and now say that he is UNFIT to be the father that he is to his own kids so long as he is not hurting them. His income has nothing to do with his relationship to his children. <br>  <br>  Women like you make me sick. You sit there and get pregnant by a man who you know has problems, and then have the nerve to try to play the self-righteous role and then and even further nerve to try to take him from his kids. Unbelieveable. Again, you are just as unfit as he is. Poor kids.|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	well, I would prepare as much information as you can. As long as it is done out of concern and safety for your child and not out of spite for him. If he is truly unfit, you better do everything in your power to prove it. From what I see in the courts and government, it's not always fair, so be you own lawyer in a sense and take care of business. Maybe supervised visitation will suit you, or random drug testing to prove him fit to visit. The custody and payment is something you will have to look up for your state or province because it isn't the same everywhere. <br>  Good luck.|`|S5x6KNHraa	yes u will have to prove him unfit and if he is on the birthcert the can keep the child and u will have to fight for custody u have to let the court handle this case good luck and yes he can get visition
wlCMlFSEaa	I would like to remind you that there are people with REAL problems out there. <br>  <br>  Many people in the world have never seen a designer watch or even smelt Flowers. Get over yourself you selfish 'princess' tippy toes. <br>  <br>  PS. You talk too much, its no wonder your Husband backs off and doesnt speak to you. <br>  <br>  PPS. instead of trying to bribe your Husband to get a Spa day of him why dont you do some good in the world???|`|ZIriZYDwaa	My man is a bit like that and its not right and you don't deserve to be treated like this.<br>  <br>  Book a spa day but go with a friend you probably have a better time.|`|Nq4vCxAUaa	Suggest the two of you sit down at a quiet place, no children or distractions, and talk about this trend.<br>  You folks need to talk.|`|VzX1ozl0aa	why do you want him to give always gifts for your birthday?|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	You make it sound like you are the only one wanting to go to the spa and you're the only one disappointed you don't get to go.  Wouldn't it be better to go when you both are in the mood for it?  Don't push him to do something nice for you.  You'll get "rewards" when you deserve them.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	You certainly do seem like a sulker. You got an expensive watch and flowers, that's a lot after being together 16 years. <br>  As for why he;s mad, maybe try not undermine his authority in front of the kids? That would p*ss me off too!|`|zeTGmB3faa	Something is bothering your husband and it may have nothing to do with the family. Unfortunately, it is human nature to take it out on the ones we love the most. He may be going through depression. <br>  Tell him in no uncertain ( but nice) terms that his attitude is going to stop and if something is bothering him so much that he is depressed, he needs to see a doctor, get counseling, medication and whatever he needs to get it fixed. Tell him that his outbursts are becoming more frequent and this is unlike him. Now when he does say something to the kids that you don't like, talk to him in private, not in front of the kids. Good luck to you. Men are like that, yeah they are!|`|c6g92RRVaa	Hmm it sounds like he is worried about money after the expensive gifts, maybe he feels that wasn't enough for you or that you weren't very greatful. People don't just get annoyed for no reason.|`|BEqAhXBlaa	"We've been together nearly 16 years and he still confuses the hell out of me."<br>  <br>  Blimey you should try and figure women out then ;-)|`|U3qTwOOIaa	I'm lucky my other half doesn't get into a 'mood'|`|AA10478980	I think your husband has a few serious issues, and you should first get counselling for yourself to figure out what to do about it.  You cannot fix him and make him the person you would like him to be, but through counselling you may be able to work out ways to lead him in a direction that will help him help himself.  You need to do this for the sake of your children.  No child deserves to be yelled at and called names by her father.  He is acting like an immature and insensitive and selfish child and it is time for him to grow up.|`|hPgRvmTUaa	It could be a lot worse by the sounds of things. Just ... I haven't a clue. Tell him the watch doesn't tell you the time right or something and see what he has to say. You sound like a very agreeable person.|`|TZpFcx47aa	Tell him to shove it up his a**. He is all pouty and mad and wont tell you why? What a tool.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Did you marry a man or a 2-year-old?|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	Wait it out and suggest it when your both in a good mood.  <br>  <br>  He does sound like a bit of a jerk, but you're clearly committed to the relationship.  Could the two of you arrange to spend some time together just to talk about things and find out if there's anything bothering him?|`|IRFbj0G9aa	Sorry to hear your Birthday was ruined like that.  Now what I am about to say is very subjective, but isn't it always.  I mean my reaction to your husbands behaviour would be alot worse.  Unacceptable after 16 years together for someone to ignore you and hold a grudge. And I am sorry for what?  Afterall your fight does not sound like it was about something, how shall I put it "make or break" serious.(I am not trivializing, but anyone in a relationship can understand that you didn't do something god awful)  In my mind, someone being cruel like that is unacceptable cause we are adults here and should be able to express our dismay as opposed to acting out like that.  I am not trying to be insensitive, honestly read what I am saying carefully and you will understand that I believe two adults should try hard at overcoming the urge to lash out to make ourselves feel better.  I am a strong believer at getting to the root of the problem.  So what would I do?  I would confront him!  Totally, don't you dare let him get away with this.  Ignore you since Sunday?  What example is this for your kids?  Or is it "do as I say not as I do?" approach?  Would he like them ignoring him and berating him with choice words?  Demand an explanation cause I think it lies deeper than this... you say he has been doing this more and more often lately?  What is going on with him?  Find out, don't let things just resolve themselves without an understanding of what triggered the outburst cause that is what it sounds like. And rest assure it will happen more and more and more intensely.  The more you stretch the boundaries of what is acceptable the more you risk allowing behaviours that well....  Let's just leave it there for now.   Honey, people only treat you the way you let them treat you.  You must feel like sh** when someone calls you names, don't take it! But don't do it either.   Stand your ground and declare that you will not have it, or else it will never stop.  And if you wont do it for yourself, do it for you daughter, (you mentioned you have a daughter) would you like your daughter's future partner to treat her like that?  Highly likely she will be, cause she unconsciously will be accepting of it cause that is what she has seen all her life.|`|X9qrMXQiaa	well he is going to say no right now. I would wait till he calms down more then tell him how it hurt you. Or say f*ck it, get a babysitter and take yourself to the spa|`|jaZazNzZaa	Okay, forget all what happened, take his hand, look straight into his eyes and say "can we please talk about this?". Wait until the kids aren't around so you can have a one to one with him. Don't mention why it got this far, just try to find out what's on his mind. He could have had a very stressful day, or there is something bothering him, show him you care and want to talk.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	He made his daughter CRY and now YOU feel bad? Wow, what a master manipulator. In this case I say just act like you don't care about the spa weekend...it confuses the heck out of guys like that.
AA10661001	You get the license from the County Clerk's office.  Change of name will be done with Social Security.  I think the license is only good for 30 days, so you are too early at this point.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Too early for the marriage license.  After April 3, go to the Register of Deeds office, and apply for your license.  Both you and your fiance have to be present.  You will pay your fee (ususlly $50) and get your license to take to the ceremony.  After the ceremony, your officiant will sign it along with 2 witnesses, and the officiant takes it back to the Register of Deeds office for recording.  You will get your official marriage certificate in the mail within a few days, and then you take that to the social security office and the dmv to change your name.  There is no specific paperwork to send in anywhere to change your name when you get married, the marriage license is sufficient.  As to when you can do it, not until after the wedding and after you get your marriage certificate.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I guess the thumbs-down patrol is out in force today.  I've gotten several thumbs down for correct answers.  Oh well...I guess ignorance is bliss, huh?|`|bO2rzfISaa	A marriage license in TX is only good for 30 days, so it's too soon.<br>  <br>  After being married you go to Social Security and the DMV after you receive the official Certificate of Marriage back from the county and you take it with you to prove your new name.<br>  <br>  It's really all very simple. Relax, don't drive yourself nuts.|`|GvamTVqAaa	It's only good for 30 days, but there's a 3 day waiting period so don't wait until the very last minute.  You can just walk into your county clerks office and get it, but both you and your fiance must be present  <br>  <br>  To change your name just bring your marriage license to the SSA and they will help you change your name on your ssc.  Once you get the proff of name change you can go and change your license and other things such as bills, etc.

Move back home get your life together and if you are a man get ready to pay child support and if you are a women take the baby and tell him you need time to think and maybe that will open his eyes and he will either treat you better or let you go.
Uj5kuzoJaa	It sounds like you need to sit down and have a talk. Try to figure out what you are feeling on the days where you feel like there is no future together. What's the reason behind feeling this way? If things just aren't working for you and you feel like you're losing interest in the whole relationship then it might be time to move on. If you want things to work out with the guy then it's time you two talked. Tell him how you're feeling and what's going on in your head. It's not uncommon for the spark to go out of a relationship when you've been together for awhile. Try to figure out what's bothering you, and I will try to help you again.|`|0EUBc2hRaa	You know it's time to move on when you're asking these questions on Yahoo... Move on. It's over.

Some people I look the other way and avoid cause it would be akward after so long, BUT if was a long time friend or a best friend I'd say Hi How are you and catch up for awhile before saying I'm in a rush would love to keep in touch and call me sometime and give them my number.  That way it leaves it in their court to pursue our friendship.

TTfTTlcCaa	You are taking his answer too personally.  Stop reading into it.  That's a girl thing, he meant EXACTLY what he said.<br>  <br>  He did not say he would have sex with her.  He didn't even say he WANTED to have sex with her.  He said he sees a hot girl, and he imagines having sex with her for a split second, and then he moves on.  So "it's too intimate and why would I want to have random sex with someone ... you don't even know how clean they are" is irrelevant. You are bringing real-world issues into a fantasy that doesn't even last more that an instant.<br>  <br>  You aren't weird, and your boyfriend and yourself are not incompatible.   I think you'd be hard pressed to find a man on the earth that doesn't do this same thing. You said it yourself, you are insecure.  That doesn't mean you are frigid.  So knock-off calling yourself names.<br>  <br>  Tell your boyfriend you are feeling a little insecure.  Ask him for some extra reassurance.  He was honest with you, now you be honest with him.  He can't give you something if he's not aware you need it.<br>  <br>  Your insecurity will lessen with age.  It also helps if you are supported and feel cherished in your relationship.  He loves you, right?  He must think that you are hot, because he is with you.  There are a million hot girls in the world, and even if you were the hottest one, he'd still be looking at the others. It's the way they are wired. But that doesn't take anything away from the way he feels about you.  And as long as he treats you right and is faithful to you, let him have a little eye candy.<br>  <br>  The more secure you are with yourself, and the more secure you feel in your relationship, the less this will bother you.  You can even get to the point where you don't care at all, I promise you.  It's not something to be worried about.  Don't be sad.  He's not trying to hurt you.|`|AA11501437	you forced him to answer a question that should have been left unsaid.  how were things before this question was answered?  there are a handfull of things that we really don't have the right to know if we can't handle it - that was one of them.  others include but are not limited to:<br>  <br>  do you love and or still miss any of your exes?<br>  do you think any of your friends of the opposite sex are hot?<br>  how often are you hit on, get flirted with?<br>  what things did your exes do that were better than your current companion?<br>  do you have sexual dreams with anyone else?<br>  <br>  Consider how good / bad things were before you knew the answer to this.  If things were great, you gotta quit worrying about what hes thinking all the time.  Good luck!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Honestly, men and women are just different. Everyone sees other people as attractive, even if they are in a relationship. The fact that he's imagining himself having sex with another woman would make anyone feel uncomfortable...but he's not actually going through with it. He's brushing it away and saying, hey I love this girl that is walking next to me. (YOU) <br>  <br>  The reason why he's not thinking more in depth like you are (like how clean they are) is because he doesn't see it becoming a reality. It's just something that pops in his head, then brushes away. It's harmless. Instead of thinking, oh great there is another pretty girl and he's going to be envisioning sex with her....think yeah, she's pretty, but this is my man and you'll never have him. <br>  <br>  I think that worrying about this has to do something with insecurity issues. I would try working on getting some more self esteem. You have to know that this is an issue with you, not him. The more you think it's him and say things to him...the more you'll push him away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|9a8pPJaLaa	You have to realize that most guys think that way.  We're visual oriented.  However, thinking and doing are different things.  He just has a flash and moves on.  Most guys think that way.  If he otherwise is faithful to you, just brush it off as "he dating you, he isn't dead".|`|FgSTHArKaa	accck i used to be like that<br>  honestly, dont worry abot things you dont know<br>  and you shouldnt try to get him to asnwer things like that either|`|LtMGBsI2aa	You are comparing apples and oranges!  Women are very emotional and men are very physical it's the whole basis of the men are from Mars, women are from Venus book.<br>  <br>  Guys look at women and think about sex or rather whether or not they would have sex with them.  Where women look at an attractive guy and simply think he's attractive.  Although some women do actually think about having sex or whether or not they would.  <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with either of you.  It's a chemical reaction that can't be controlled.  A person is not defined by what they think, they're defined by what they do.  Guys think about sex and some even go as far as to have sex with as many girls as they can.  <br>  <br>  If your man is being faithful to you then you are obviously the one he really wants.  Does it really matter what his hormones make him think of???|`|8KvIW8YLaa	If you realy like him, give a head when you think he is sexualy dense.<br>  Even if you are cool sexualy, you are not fortunate to like a correlate gender with different temperament other way like oral.|`|xVMPH7Bbaa	Jen, Jen, Jen. This is a normal thing for guys to go through. Every male has thoughts of having sex with every "hot" woman on the face of the Earth. It's a phase.<br>  <br>  Although It's not the best strategy it works more often than people think, take him out, and remind him of why he fell in love with you. If you have to, resort to the bedroom and show him how hot you think you are. Get some sexy lingerie, sweet candles (on the dresser across from you bed), and maybe some soft music. Show him you have true confidence in yourself, but be sure to let him know you want him to be faithful to you, and you want to be faithful to him. I know it's a long shot but men do like to be taken advantage of. So like I said before, take HIM out. Don't make him take you out. You don't even have to do anything fancy, a movie and a burger. A picnic at the park. Cuddled up in the truck watching the lake or ocean. Something simple, yet romantic.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, you see who he really is, and how he is only attracted to others by looks, rather than the person they are on the inside. <br>  <br>  Sorry this was so long.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

Hopefully he remembers without you having to tell him but be prepared if he doesn't. <br>  <br>  <br>  My father is HORRIBLE at birthdays but knows when his anniversay is.. so I guess that is a good thing, right?|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Either way, it will still be your birthday and it seems important to you so, say so!|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Suppose rather than go out, he opts to buy you flowers, a card, and bake you a cake? He will still have remembered but would you be as satisfied with that, as if you guys go out? If so, then no don't say anything because gift giving is supposed to be about the thought rather than the actual gift. However, if you would be disappointed, it would be best to tell him exactly what you want. <br>  <br>  Saying, "you know what? I'd like to do __________, __________, and/or _________ for my birthday this year. "  isn't the same as, "you do remember that my birthday is _________? don't get me those same old _________ that you gave me last year! I'd be surprised if you didn't forget". Asking for something specific isn't the same as being pushy. You just want him to know what you'd like. What's wrong with that?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Depends on the husband.   Some wives buy themselves a gift for their husband to give them, some remind them, others do nothing.   If you remind him he will rely on you to do so in the future, if you don't he'll probably forget but feel really bad this year and work harder next year to remember.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I remind my husband of every occasion I want remembered - anniversaries, birthdays, valentine's day. Of course he loves me, I wouldn't still be married if he didn't, I just don't want to set myself or him up for a big let down. Remind him.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Why set yourself up for unnecessary drama? Because if you're here, then I'd imagine you would act petty if he forgot. Sometimes I forget when my own birthday is coming up so I don't see any harm in mentioning it.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	you just had a baby 4 months ago...his mind might not be on your birthday.  If you want to be recognized on your special day I'd remind him.|`|krQiDGCHaa	This whole thing really baffles me.<br>  <br>  My husband has never forgotten my birthday, and I cannot understand how someone can forget their spouse's birthday.<br>  <br>  By the way -- if you don't bring it up, that's fine, but then you can't be mad at him if he doesn't remember.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	I don't forget my wife's birthday and she doesn't forget mine, it's inconsiderate and rude and implies you don't care. Thanks to the stereotype about men forgetting birthdays it's been made almost comical so people accept it =/|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I'd say "Hey what do you want to do on the 12th" and see if he even realizes its your birthday. If he doesn't realize it remind him but if he does consider yourself lucky. I love my man but I have to remind him of his own mother's birthday.|`|98181102c394b59c9cbd53b723ee58dfaa	well as for me i do remind my husband ,cuz if he forgets i would be very up set. so why do i want to get mad on my birthday? so for it not to let that happen i remind him, not  every hour lol . maybe once. on the week before my birthday .|`|qsLhVZd8aa	What's the big deal about reminding him?  If you don't and he forgets, I imagine you'll be all upset and cause problems.  Do you really want to cause a bunch of useless drama over a birthday?|`|QY9vjyBlaa	Remind him. Right now, I'm counting down the days to my birthday to my husband, it's in 10 days.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You think he won't remember!!!! that would be very odd.|`|USooqQlWaa	I didn't tell my husband and went almost the whole day keeping the secret.  I'm older now so don't really give a rat's a** about my birthday.  I had some fun with it...my bff was gonna call the day after my birthday and ask him if she could take me out.  We were SO wanting him to forget so we could see the look on his face the next day but he remembered later that evening and scribbled a Happy Birthday on some paper and gave me $20.  It was funny.  Don't make it a big serious issue...men are horrible about these things and once we're adults it doesn't really matter anymore.<br>  <br>  Have some fun with it.|`|fELUJmkvaa	If you've been married less than 5 years he should remember...more than that men don't remember much ha ha!  Put a big star on the calendar on your birthday.  Maybe that will jolt his memory.  Also depends on if you want to have a nice b-day or a b-day where you're mad at him for forgetting....Happy Birthday!!!|`|TWCQCSfRaa	It's not pushy to suggest going out for dinner on your birthday.  Do you really want to put your spouse in a situation to forget your birthday?  It'll just ruin your day if he does.  Skip the fight, suggest dinner, and then enjoy yourself!|`|EbUSYjLRaa	take it from a guy, guys are stupid with dates, you will have a better birthday if you tell him about it and even tell him what you want ( i love it when my wife says  buy me that ) my wife tells me the month before and then every week, my wife rocks|`|fKOnp43Maa	I say let him remember. If he remembers your birthday then you know he is thinking about you. He may already have a surprise for you. Oh and have a wonderful birthday!|`|YUkzmz1daa	Remind the poor guy. I have to remind my husband of HIS mothers birthday. Its just a guy thing.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	See is he remembers, if he has not mentioned it you never know he could be planning something for you. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!:)|`|TZpFcx47aa	Just go on and remind him. Why tempt drama??|`|RgINbeNFaa	im a guy, remind him

QZ1siB8Qaa	The weekend before is a great time for a party...Its easier for everyone to attend...The night before isn't a good idea, hence drinking will be involved, don't want to have a hangover on the BIG day! <br>  We decided to share the party-that way all our friends could get acquainted with one another before the BIG day...The girls went shopping during the day, went to a spa, while the boys went golfing, etc. Once the evening came, we all went out for a night on the town. <br>  Everyone enjoyed it. It gave everyone a chance to share stories about the bride/groom-to-be, share laughs with everyone, etc.

Wait until you see her alone in the hallway if you're nervous, and then approach her, confidently. Say something like, "Hi. I was wondering if you would like to go to Prom with me." It's simple, it's honest, and girls like it when you make yourself vulnerable. Don't have your friends ask for you or try to get her to guess what you want. It also wouldn't hurt to have a flower or other small token of affection.<br>  <br>  If you really can't get up the courage to ask her face to face, you can always go with the classic note. Write something heart felt (but don't over do it here), and either hand it to her, or put it in her locker.

UBdt4Wm0aa	If it's over, why does she feel so comfortable sending a personal email? He must not have made himself too clear.  I know he can't control what she does, but he needs to put her in her place and let her know that under no circumstances will he ever get involved with her again and she needs to respect that he's working on his marriage. He should ask her to go to coffee to talk and you should GO WITH HIM. That way, she sees you two as a married couple who is a united front that won't be broken. Don't settle for a phone call or email that he sends in reply to hers. Do it in person so you know she'll get the message loud and clear. If he isn't willing to do that, then he isn't worth your time. I know it will be uncomfortable, but it will work! Your husband should be willing to jump through hoops and comply with whatever it takes to win your trust back. I would think he would look for a new job too, since she's there and it has to make you wonder if he's still talking to her, etc. The economy sucks though, so that might not be practical. <br>  <br>  No matter what, your husband needs counseling and he should thank God he has a wife like you who hasn't strung him up by his b*lls. I don't know if I would be nearly as understanding.|`|TI65WNunaa	I agree with Underwater Angel and others here YOUR LOUSY *** HUSBAND is the one who brought an insider into your marriage. even if he finds another job he can still cheat it was the chance he was take.  As women we usually lose ourselves in our men, and forget that we are also individuals who enjoyed life.  I know exactly how you feel there were times when I wanted to go to the little b-itches job that was messing with my husband catch her, and beat the sh-t out of her or worse.  Then there were those thoughts of doing the same or worse to my hubby.  I would have nightmares and everything, my emotional and mental state was not good.  It was when I actually considered suicide that I woke up.  It hurts like hell, but he is not worth all the anguish you are going through.  Nobody is perfect but I wish mine had left instead of cheating.  You are stronger than you think don't let this mans horrible behavior and betrayal of you define who you are.  Find a counselor or a pastor to talk to so you can gain the strength to pull through all this.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Ok sweetie, its not her fault....hurt him not her! He is the one making the choice. He can put a stop to it. He could delete his email....only share an account with you.  He could change his cell number....he could get a restraining order against her. <br>  You have got to know this is his job to stop not yours....<br>  check out these sites:<br>  www.truthaboutdeception.com<br>  www.signs-of-a-cheater.com<br>  www.chatcheaters.com<br>  www.womansavers.com<br>  He has to cut all ties with her....even if it means finding another career.<br>  Otherwise you either share him or have to do the hard thing and leave him. <br>  Im sorry you are suffering through this.Its very heart breaking.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Confront her! Tell her to back off your husband. Confront him about the email and tell him he needs to start looking for a new job. I know the economy is bad right now but he can at least try to find something else and if he wants to save your marriage he had better get on it.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	tell him you found the email, tell him to ask her to stop contacting him.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Did he respond back to her?

Also put Nair in his shampoo.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	Tires?  screw the tires. i'm thinking her throat.. and his too.|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Dump him.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Have your husband call her while you are there, and have him tell her that he wants NOTHING to do with her. And for her to not contact him in any way for any reason. Make sure that he lets her know that he wants this, and that he's NOT doing it because you are making him<br>  <br>  <br>  Then, if she doesn't stop trying to contact him, then you can go file for a restraining order, and possibly file charges on her for harassment.<br>  <br>  As far as emails go, you can block her so she can't send you any emails. And as for your home phone, grab your phone book at look through the front pages, or the back. Most phone books have codes that you can enter in to your phone to block people from calling you and to also set it so they can't call your phone with blocking their number from shwoing on your caller ID.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	he should show you and tell you how he is handling this so youre not all stressed out.  yes, that stress can make you physically and emotionally unwell.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sorry to say this, but you are focusing on her....and you should be more concerned about him...<br>  <br>  HE is the one who is married to you. HE is the one who had an affair. HE is the one who decided to fool around. HE is the one who has broken your trust and vows. The woman is just a part of the mess.<br>  <br>  I think you should decide if you want to live like this forever...or not. <br>  Your husband should talk to this woman and tell her to leave him alone. He should actually do it in front of you, if you think it would make you feel better.<br>  <br>  But remember...It takes "two to tango." <br>  Just as it takes two people to have an affair, it takes two people to make a marriage work out.<br>  <br>  Go to counseling or therapy if you can. You sound very stressed, hurt, confused, angry and sad. Get help. Soon. You need it.<br>  Good luck.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Tell your husband he needs to look for another job. Change email addresses, block her from your phone. If I was you, I would call her from my husband's phone. Or reply to her email as him saying you want absolutely nothing to do with her. You could also report her to HR for sexual harrassment. Don't know if it would work, but it's worth a try.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You should feel like hurting HIM real bad, not her. He is the one who needs to make it clear that it's over. He has a choice of finding a new job if he feels too tempted by her. She can't get him back if he's not willing to get back with her.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	confront the ******

MVJdwyIkaa	Wow, this seems all too familiar! You need to have a quiet moment with yourself and yes let go of the past, make a promise to yourself that you will let the past go and not waste time on negative thoughts! It sounds to me that you have a wonderful life with him so count your blessings and enjoy your family and look to the future for many more wonderful memories!|`|4DDSD9Syaa	I used to be like that. Advice: You will never be able to move forward happily if you continue to hold on to the past. Let it go. Check yourself when you start getting or thinking about the negative thoughts/feelings stop and think Why are you doing it? Live for right now, look at your present life right now, you say you love going home to your family. That is it, continue to feel that way, put everything negative aside. It is the past, what is done is done. It seems like you have a great man. And men do not like drama. They are very simple creatures so keep it simple, love yourself, him and your family :-)|`|VPOVFc6laa	i dont know...am in the same situation, but i know you need to let it go! but with time you will, just dont think too much about it.|`|W9z9Al4Oaa	you just have to let go. When my boyfriend and i first met things were really bad too. There was another girl involved and i felt betrayed to, but now we are together and in love and every things going great and even though when i think of the past it hurts i just have to make myself let it go . You have to make yourself let go to and just brush it off because maybe if things didn't go wrong back then.... you guys wouldn't be as strong now.... so think about now and not then....
a984cQjKaa	if you both enjoy it, who gives a damn?|`|fqSFA1Gzaa	Bedroom activities behind closed doors are all good as long as they fit under the safe, sane and consensual umbrella. The offbeat stuff, IMO, add to the intimacy and trust of a relationship but can backfire later if the relationship starts to come apart. Secrets can come out as people who once loved each other try to hurt each other but I wouldn't let that intimidate me.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Wow that is a little odd. Are you sure your not gay? Did she ask you to do this or did you start doing it by yourself? This just doesn't seem normal, maybe she is a closet lesbian.

That just creeps me out. I read sexual stuff on the 'net sometimes too, usually when I'm bored of porn. The girl-on-girl really doesn't do anything for me, but it doesn't gross me out or anything, same with guy-on-guy. Oh, I am not a big fetish person.

Women do NOT enjoy making porn movies and a closer behind-the-scenes look will show you several reasons why. <br>  In the world of hardcore sex, an average day on the set for a porn actress is a long and tedious process. Women are told to come in around 8 am for makeup but it's only to make sure porn actresses arrive on time to work. Porn stars have a nasty habit of arriving late because they're often hung over from drugs or alcohol from the night before. <br>  After make up, porn actresses usually wait around long hours until it's their turn to do their scene. Some scenes take an hour and some take several hours to film. It really depends if the male actor in the first scene could "perform" or not. It also depends if female actresses have to stop the clock because they can't handle the pain of a hardcore sex scene. <br>  While waiting around, jaded porn performers usually end up in the rest rooms with bottles of alcohol and lines of speed or outside in their cars for a heroin fix or gathered in the back yard with other actors to smoke marijuana. <br>  To add to the mind-numbing process, women are never able to experience sexual pleasure because of the continuous cutting during sex scenes. In the background the director constantly yells, "cut" and the flow of action is interrupted in order to get a better shot, adjust lighting or to wipe up bodily fluids. Repeatedly pornographers stop scenes and ask actors to "freeze" in position during very hardcore sex acts, which causes great physical and emotional pain for porn actresses. <br>  I speak from personal experience when I say to be in the middle of a hardcore sex act with several actors at the same time and told to "freeze" in position for several minutes while lighting or cameras are adjusted is extremely painful and degrading. It's also very humiliating when scenes are stopped in order to wipe up bodily fluids such as semen, feces and blood. <br>  Despite the fact women do not enjoy making porn movies, they continue to lie to their fans and proudly insist they enjoy making porn movies. Of course they do. They get paid hundreds and thousands of dollars to lie because this is their occupation. Porn stars are paid professional liars who know how to "act" and they do it well. In fact, because porn stars spend a great deal time in front of the camera and never step out of character, they usually have greater acting abilities than mainstream Hollywood actors. <br>  I used to brag endlessly to fans and pornographers about my extreme "Italian" sex drive and how I loved making porn movies. I would go on and on about how I needed more and more to fulfill my insatiable appetite. I lied 100% of the time to 100% of the people. Lying is the native language of porn stars because they can't afford to tell you the truth. Not only would it ruin the fantasy for their fans but more importantly, it would ruin the amount of their paychecks. Don't believe porn actresses when they proudly proclaim they enjoy making porn movies. They're ACTING.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Okay... I'm guessing all the "ews" are from younger members of Answers. <br>  <br>  I am a 26 year old, professional, responsible adult.  Ive never had issues with drugs or alcohol.  I've never been pregnant, and I'm in a committed long term relationship with a man I plan on marrying.  We watch porn together, and I sometimes watch it on my own.  When we lived far apart, I would use a combination of porn and masturbation to get me through the weeks we couldn't see each other.  So did he.    <br>  <br>  It's a safe alternative to casual sex, and all of the people involved are doing it by choice.  My boyfriend and I now use it to stimulate our sex life, and keep things interesting.  I've never understood why people are so afraid of pornography.   I like the "normal" stuff (no girl on girl though)  and there's nothing disgusting about it.|`|R46f2nn9aa	One time, I was in an apartment at like 3 in the morning with me and a bunch of my guy friends (I was the only girl) and they turned porn on, that was the only time I watched it, and it was only like, a part of one scene, then I got too uncomfortable and went to The kitchen and talked to some of the guys that weren't watching it.<br>  <br>  PORN IS DUMB AND DEGRADING AND GROSS AND DEGRADING|`|8vfCRg7Caa	the girl in this photo i have watches porn. i gave her one of my porno dvds and ive also gave some of my neighbors in the past some. And they were women. To be real honest all where young and had children. like 18 19 and 20 young. Some do most dont. Girls have sex anytime they want, so that is that. But then again these girls drink and smoke. So go figure.
vvdc5EnTaa	well, I'm on my husband's account. My name is Amanda Frazier. My husband just returned from a tour in a Iraq and let me tell you, that is very hard to go through. We've been together for ten years and it was really hard for even me. A lot of people don't make it. Six months isn't really that long because a person can still have some qualities that you might not like that haven't yet surfaced. You need to give it time before thinking about marriage and I would say the relationship isn't doomed unless you have given up on it. Stay strong, stay loyal, stay loving. If he does the same then I say it has a pretty good chance at working out. <br>  Best of luck to you guys. I hope he stays safe and hopefully isn't there for long.
xxxu1wxQaa	In my personal opinion, a BBQ is going to be too expensive for your budget and not to mention too time consuming. The people suggesting that you have family members and even FATHERS man the grill haven't thought that through. I know I wouldn't want to put my family to work all day, they won't even be able to enjoy the special day with you. Another thing is that you must also buy propane and or lighter fluid, charcoal tons more than just "food". My suggestion is to do cold shrimp platters that you can purchase at local grocery store for $10 that come with cocktail sauce. Also some mini sandwiches cut with cookie cutter hearts. Do put the covered sandwich trays on ice (ice chest) until ready to serve. You can "fancy" them up by adding romaine lettuce and spreads maybe roast beef. Do another tray of wraps cut into smaller pieces. I get the flavored tortillas (sun dried tomato the best!) and get softened cream cheese to spread on the entire tortilla very thin layer and then sprinkle dry french onion or ranch dip packet on top (just a few sprinkles) then a piece of lettuce and a turkey sliced thinly, roll it up and cut into small pieces. Have a TROPICAL fruit tray magos,passion fruit,coconut,  kiwi..etc nothing simple like apples. You can have the fruits cut into nice shapes if possible stars. Do a "gourmet" cheese tray. Go to the cheese section and buyed blocked cheeses (pepper jack, sharp cheddar, muenster) and cut them in blocks yourself! Such a money saver. Another thing that I do that looks like it costs a ton is the lil smokies in croissaints. Can make about 25 for $4. Get the pillsbury croissant dough and rip it up roll a lil smokie in it. You can use about 4 pieces out of one croissant! They are perfectly fine served cold. Also a cold veggie tray. If possible have the food under a pavillion or tarp. Last but not least, have fun! Don't worry about anything but your husband and yourself on your special day. I bet you can use all of my tips and save hundreds of dollars!! Good luck|`|rzPIO1aQaa	BBQ is a great idea. You could have your father or his do the cooking or even have another person do it who wouldn't mind. Most people wouldn't care to help out with it considering they will be eating it. And you can have each family member bring a dish that would go along with the food this saves you time and money. They could bring beans, potato salad, cole slaw, banana pudding, the sauce,etc. It would be great, taste good and not put you over budget. Good luck and congrats|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I think what others said about the BBQ is a good idea but also consider a Clambake/Sea food bar. It might be a nice little addition. You can go to Sam's Club/Costco like store to stock up on a lot of the fish and shrimp. It won't cost you too much. The cool thing about the Sea Food bar, once the food is gone it's gone, you won't have to spend to much on the idea but it would give your guests some variety.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	How about shish kebabs?  They are easy to make and they always look really impressive and colorful, plus they'd be the perfect thing to eat at the beach.|`|Y9djVW1Naa	Have a selection of cold foods that can be made beforehand:<br>  Sandwiches<br>  Sushi rolls<br>  Quiches<br>  Wraps<br>  Bruscetta<br>  Cakes/muffins<br>  <br>  Then have your bbq as well.<br>  Is there a family member that will be happy to help? You might have to hire someone to work the grill, perhaps from a local college or something...|`|mdIiomjNaa	A BBQ would be a good idea, as long as the weather holds up for you. Then you can cook whatever people want. Salads, Sandwiches, chicken legs, sausage rolls, e.t.c. Bananas and Pineapple on the grill are gorgeous! Allot of people don't like fancy food anyway. Good luck for your big day hun. x|`|hizRPh9raa	How about a seafood buffet. You can still do it yourself by prepping a bunch of different seafood items (crab, sushi, oysters) and let them set on ice set up on a table. Other than that, finger foods are the way to go.|`|xuiSfzgraa	If you could find someone to do it for you, you could have a pig roast...the only problem with that is you would have to have someone willing to be there all day roasting it...But it feeds quite a few people, and is not too expensive.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	You can't go far wrong with a BBQ, which will fit perfectly naturally into the beach atmosphere.  Anybody could, in theory, man the grill - perhaps a few volunteers taking in turns.|`|QsC3qGkOaa	in beach wedding<br>  you should serve seafood like: fish/crabs/shrimps/squids etc.|`|FzFSzilmaa	preferably something that won't attract wasps... *shudder*|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	BBQ sounds great for a beach wedding. You could serve burgers and brats or chicken breast. You can get those in bulk inexpensively at Costco/Sam's. For sides, you could go with potato salad, pasta salad, baked beans, fruit salad, condiments and veggies for the burgers, etc. <br>  <br>  As for someone to man the grill, preferably not one of your guests, otherwise they won't be able to enjoy the reception. Do you know any teenagers who would like to earn a few bucks but you wouldn't be otherwise inviting? They could do it for you.|`|zSABr7praa	I think if you could rent a giant grill that would be AWESOME.  I went to a beach wedding in NC last summer, and the couple rented a large grill.  The bride had her uncles or cousins sign up in advance to take shifts manning the grill.  They actually took a lot of pride in it, walking up to everyone and asking "HOW'S THE BURGER?!  HOW'S THAT STEAK!?"  It was cute.  I would do hot dogs for the kids, and chicken, burgers, brats, and or steak depending on what kind of set up you have.  (You don't want to be serving food you need to cut it you don't have tables for everyone).  If you buy meat in bulk, it's cheaper at Sam's, Gordon's, or Cosco.  I wouldn't do flimsy plates though, the beach is very windy.  Pasta salad is always a hit, and it's very easy (and doesn't require re-heating).  At the DIY beach wedding I went to, the only hot food they had was the grill, keeping food warm is a hassle unless you have the buffet warmers.  Best of luck, beach weddings are a blast!
y4SUDnpaaa	Her threat to press harassment charges against you is just absurd. However, if she called you 45 times in one day you do have  valid reason to sue her for harassment if  you wanted to. I agree with everyone who said let him instigate the visitations, you're not obligated in any way to make him see or care about your son, that's his decision. If he's at all   interested in the child's welfare he could easily call and talk to him. Don't go to his job and don't call.  Don't put up with this drama anymore and cut stop instigating any  communication with him. I would check your divorce decree, because you may be obligated to notify him, whether he's interested or not, when your child has a medical problem. If you are obligated send email, make it a priority email to him and inform him about the illness or accident, what is being done and say good bye, don't ask him to do anything, that's his choice. I also agree with the one who said it would be better for the child to keep him away from the step mother, who knows how she treats him or tells him about you. Since his father is taking no interest in his son's life the idea of co parenting is absurd. You've put the ball in his court, and for you and your sons sakes I personally hope he just lets it lie there unless the gf is out of his life. I think you are doing your son a disservice by trying to force his father to care for him. Evidently he loves his psycho gf more than his son.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Of course you can phone him to discuss issues related to your child.  You're part of the problem because you are allowing her and the rumours about what she says to dictate how you conduct your own life.<br>  <br>  If your co-parenting causes her to freak out on him, that's his issue, not yours.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps the best thing to do is sit down with him and tell him that until she can treat you in a civil manner, you will have no choice but to terminate any contact with his household.  It will be up to him to work out how to deal with her and still be a father to his child at the same time.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Well, this has a simple explanation....<br>  <br>  She took what wasn't hers and now she knows that because he would cheat on his wife, whom he also had a child with... (cheating with her, but still he cheated on you) she knows she can't trust him. So, she is going to try to do everything in her power to make life unbearable between the two of you - so that she can rest a bit easier knowing he isn't fooling around on her with you....<br>  <br>  That's why she is pretty much a phsyco! <br>  <br>  You can't trust a cheater, even when they cheated on their spouse with you... Because who is to say that you wont get cheated on... right?? She knows. :-)<br>  <br>  All I can suggest is telling him that you and him need to communicate whether or not his GF likes it. Because it is about your and his son. PERIOD. Tell him he needs to get his own cell, or heck, even a pager. At least if he had a pager, you could page with 411 or 911 to let him know if it was about info or if it was IMPORTANT and need to talk to him ASAP.<br>  <br>  Other than that, they both need to grow up... but I know there isn't a way to help them there. Sorry.|`|8txWayVnaa	This is not a problem you can fix.  Your ex-husband has to fix it.  Doesn't your ex have a cell phone?  Problem solved.<br>  <br>  If you have sole custody, then you need to be prepared to raise your son on your own.  Obviously, you should require your ex to pay child support.  However, you should tell your ex that you are not going to deal with his GF and her threats.  Tell him that he is free to see his son, but he will have to do the initiating and make the effort.  <br>  <br>  Leave the door open to a relationship with his son and let him walk through it.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she knows what she did to u, and she does see u as a threat, because of problems she has with her own self esteem. so she will keep u away, and your ex is allowing it. nothing u can do, i ran into the same problem, and u know what he never spoke up to her, never saw his daughter, nor did he support her. she seems to dislike u just because u exist, and was the woman before her. my ex husbands second wife would not allow him to ever communicate with us, and its still this way after all these years.so the only advice i have is to be glad he isn't with u, and don't include him in your son's life. because he's just blaming u, and not the person who is causing all the pain. this woman knows what she is and what she did to u, and its not comfortable to her emotionally to even acknowledge you or your sons existence. she will always do this, it will never change, he will always let her run the show, and its your son who will be cheated out of a normal life with his dad. and when your son gets older this woman will vilify u, tell lies on why his dad left, to justify what she did to u. distance yourself from your ex, if u have full custody u don't need him to make decisions.u can't expect him to step up to the plate, because this man is a coward who was pursued, given ultimatums, and controlled by her and Will always be.|`|bO2rzfISaa	If you want your ex to get along with you don't send him emails telling him to quit hitting on you.

There's a ten foot wall up.<br>  <br>  Call his cell phone or better yet text him ONLY about the child.|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	get a lawyer in Between|`|8PDzaAJcaa	So how do you know SHE is saying all of this or throwing these fits if you have never talked to her? Maybe he is making that part up so that he can say or do whatever he wants and not have to take responsibility for his own actions.  If he truly wanted to communicate with you about your son, he would do it and put his foot down with his GF, if he was abusive and controlling with you, don't you think he would be the same way with her and take charge of the situation? I would wait for him to make contact with you and in the mean time, go about your own life.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	My girlfriend had similar issues - she finally resorted to keeping all communication to e-mail.  This way it is admissible in court (keep that in mind...) and shows that you made attempts to communicate with him.  Also, contact your lawyer and run it by him/her and see if they have any other suggestions - that's were my friend got her info.  So she and her ex did the e-mail thing for about 6 months until he decided it was kind of stupid and pulled his head out of his butt...now they communicate civilly.|`|a984cQjKaa	tell your ex if his son isn't important enough to him to keep his ***** under control, you'll make sure he doesn't have contact with him.   that may be enough for him to straighten up.  if not, well, it's not like he's a wonderful human being anyway, so your son is probably better off without him.|`|b8VRlStoaa	Sadly, your intentions are well placed, but you will have to eventually accept the fact that communication with your ex for the child's sake may not be possible. And as your son gets older and becomes more aware, you trying to communicate and always causing trouble at his dads house may make you the bad guy. Do the best you can with your son as his mom, and leave his dad alone to be his dad as long as it doesn't endanger your son. Otherwise you will be the one whose seen as interfering and causing trouble. Your divorced, it's not up to you to make him a good dad anymore.|`|djUMvICoaa	Yeah, she knows about cheating spouses, she has one and she can't trust him.  And good for you for throwing him out.  But now she's the one with the insecurities, that he can still love two men, justice is served.  But that isn't helping you.  First off, she can't do anything to you for calling to talk to him about your child.  That's crazy talk.  But she would make it difficult anyway.  It's amazing how he is O.K. with you but when she finds out he even has to take it out on you, must be a lot of fun in that house.  She's controling and abusive.  You may have to tell your ex it's going to be up to him to call you to see if there is any information that he needs to know.  You shouldn't keep putting yourself on this gals firing line.If anything you could try a restraining order against her so she would have to let you talk to your ex, but that could be bad too.  And for what she might be spreading, I came from a small town and you can't buffalo the people,if you're the one blowing smoke because you spent your life blowing smoke, they know it and know how to take what she says.  It's your ex who needs to get a backbone in this situation, it is the bed he chose to live in he should at least fix it enough to ensure you that you won't come under fire from her.  You are smart in keeping her out of the mix for now, but if she had any smarts at all she would want to be involved which brings me to my next question, how well do you think your child is being taken care of over there?  Do you think she is abusing him at all including verbally?  If so you should cut off all visitation until that gets resolved.  Even  sending a child into whatever mess they have going on scares the heck out of me, it's going to affect him the rest of his life too.  If you need a little extra support or kind words write, I'll try to point you in the right direction|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	His girlfriend sounds like a complete psycho.<br>  You guys have a child together and he needs to man up and take responsibility for your son as a father and not have his girlfriend acting like an idiot.<br>  She should respect you and you her because of the fact that there is a child involved.<br>  Talk to him and stress the importance of you guys communicating for the sake of your son. <br>  And be glad you're not with this abusive guy anymore. She prob is putting up with all his bad stuff now.|`|p6QizgmRaa	His new girl has a trust issue. She got your ex by him cheating on his wife. Don't you think she is paranoid he will do the same thing to her? She deserves the misery she is now living in (not being able to trust him).<br>  I wouldn't email him or go to his job for any reason what-so-ever. I would call him at home, just as you should. Any court would laugh their a*s off at her about harassment charges if you are in fact calling about your son. Unless of course, you are calling numerous times a day, every day. That truly is harassment and it would then be for your own pleasure rather than the child's needs.|`|2uZivThaaa	She sounds like a freaking nut job! Honestly what I would do if you guys are still doing the court thing maybe  you should bring it up to the judge that his girlfriend is making it very difficult to have shared custody with you and your ex-husband. If not I would tell your ex that if she does not stop being a nut job you will stop bringing your son over to visit him, which is horrible I know, but what other choice do you have? Shes going to make this whole situation a living hell for  you and your son! And the way you descirbe her, she sounds like shes not that nice to your son, especially when she wont look after him on the weekends! You don't want that nut job influencing your son! Another way is maybe...go to the police and file a complaint, because it sounds like she is harassing you! Im really sorry that is a tough situation and I wish you the best of luck! I hope my advice helped you a little bit!|`|64966f431eb7c4148256720cef5f2654aa	To begin with, you can't just press charges and *poof* you're guilty - there's needs to be proof, and if she keeps contacting the authorities, they will just consider her a nuissance.   You calling the baby's dad to keep him informed of your child's health is not harassment, and no authority would consider it so.<br>  <br>  Take into account that once she has the baby, it might get worse, because she seems like she's the type to give preference to her child over yours and make your child feel second-best.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're just bringing stress on yourself by trying to reach out to him, even if it's the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  If you have sole custody, then you don't have to give any information to your ex.  If he wants to see the baby, let him call you.  If you need to explain how to give the baby the meds in detail, then email him and copy his girlfriend and any other relative who watches the baby - that way they'll both know exactly how to do it, and no one can claim you didn't explain it right.<br>  <br>  My cousin married a guy who had a psycho-ex and caused all kinds of problems at the beginning of their relationship.  She's mellowed out, but it's taken years, and a lot of help from the in-laws.  But everyone has to get a spine and stand up for what's right, or else she's just going to keep on with her behavior, and you can't be expected to do it alone.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	This sounds like your Ex doesn't want to communicate with you, but you are forcing him to communicate with you. If you continue, you will cause him to hate you and terminate any chance of having a civil relationship. If he wanted to communicate with you, he would communicate with you despite his new girl friend.<br>  <br>  Stop. The ages between 2 and 4 are when a child is socialized. It is done by imprinting. What he sees and hears at this age will determine how he acts as an adult. You are teaching him to be controlling and demanding.<br>  <br>  Do like other parents. If the ex spouse needs to know how to administer meds, write it down and give the note to the ex- spouse when they pick up the kid. Going to his work place having him go to the Rx with you is out of line.<br>  <br>  Limit your communications to necessary things like not being home when the ex comes to pick up or drop off the kid, or there has been an emergency.|`|Z2YgGifCaa	I would suggest family counseling for everyone involved and if they (the ex-husband and his gf) don't agree, then go back to the original court order and don't allow him any more than what is ordered by the courts because the situation as it is isn't good for anyone involved, especially your child.<br>  <br>  If your ex really wants to keep his relationship with his child in tact he will start acting on his own behalf and stop being a programmed robot for his gf because it will end up costing him dearly in the end.<br>  <br>  Also, you might want to check with your caseworker through the court and see if there are any legal remedies through the court as I know they often times offer counseling, mediation, etc. to help with issues such as this. I know from experience as my ex-husband and I had to go through this due to the fact that the mother of his children was using her new husband as a means of preventing their father (my husband) from being a major part in their lives.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, document everything you can, even if it means keeping a journal or log of some sort of what happens and when (phone calls, meetings, doctors appointments, etc.). If you end up having to go to court it might come in handy and while you may never need it, it is better to have and not need, than to need it and not have it. ;-)<br>  <br>  But definitely look into it and keep in mind that your child is the only one that's truly going to be effected by how everyone gets along.|`|gnqJ1gq3aa	i too think you haven't moved on.  why is his gf an issue to you?  the only reason she hates you is because it's obvious your communicating more than you should.  whats happened in the past - you meeting with him after work is completely f9cked up.  he should be responsible enough to read instructions off the prescription and its a lame excuse to see him - i think.  i hope you get your own man to worry about and for christ sake the child is only 2.  what is there to talk about?  i think you should only call for pick up, drop off.  good luck to y ou.|`|nbfxnw9Yaa	I didnt read it all - its long!<br>  <br>  However i did skim it an basically got the story. <br>  <br>  About that email it would of shown that it was from his address so u can prove she was lying about that. <br>  <br>  She cant get you done for harrassment because the police have no record of you troubling her in the passed so they wouldnt do a thing. <br>  <br>  Is your ex husband really interested in seeing his son? its so wrong of her to react the way she does, she is so insecure an jealous of you. what happens when her baby comes along - will your ex really have time for your son? <br>  <br>  i think you should send him an email, you cant be doing with all the stuff you said an he needs to make a desision as to whether he actualyl wants to be a part of the childs life its either telling his gf straight that she cant stop him or he has no involvementyou have custody an you may think its nasty on your son but when hes older would he really want a father like that in his life?you cheated on you bullied you! he doesnt understand the pain you went through but when hes older it'l hit him an im sure he will have some sort of resentment towards him. <br>  <br>  or you can carry on an wait till her baby is born, have a mother to mother talk an ask her how would she feel if her baby couldnt hardly see his/her father because someone getting in the way xxxxx|`|tkFMTz60aa	I personally wouldn't waste time trying to communicate to him. Let him make the effort. That way you can't be blamed for anything. I don't even think that its such a good idea to have your son around his girlfriend because you never know what she could do to your child out of spite.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	I'm not sure why you have to tell him every detail of your son's life.  If it's not an emergency then you don't need to be bothering him all the time.  Your not together and not raising your child together so you should probably stop making him a part of your life.  I would be upset if I was the girlfriend too.  Raise your child and let him have his parenting time but "not together"  Grow up and make decisions on your own.

vn2Lq7hIaa	I'm sorry I can't give you any advice that will help you with hubby.I do understand how disappointed you feel, and I don't understand how he can't see it too. You have more than put your fair share in that situation for far to long without respect or even a thank you. Are you sure you want to live the rest of your days waiting on him, doing all the work, without a pittance in return. You are the kind of woman most men dream about having for a wife, but never find. So if you ever plan on getting out of that rut he put you in, let me assure you there are plenty of takers out there that will give you the respect you deserve.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|bO2rzfISaa	Though I think your husband is being an ***, I think you're taking it all a lot more seriously than is necessary. Do the dishes when you feel like it, and don't get so worked up over it.

Which means for you NO MORE P*SSY until he starts helping on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  So you don't have sex for a month or two. Hell most women can do that standing on their heads.

This could be my house, almost word for word.  The twist to my story is that yesterday, I caught my ****** of a husband cheating on me.  Unfortunately, I don't have an answer for you.  Normally, I would have said head for the hills as fast as you can, but I'm finding myself on the fence on staying anyway.  How stupid am I?  Anyway, to your question.  I guess you could ask yourself how important he is to you.  Do you have kids, a house, other issues that are important if you were to leave?  Are they more important than wanting help from your husband?  I think you have to pick a breaking point; you can only tolerate so much for so long.  Good luck.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Nagging won't get thru to his head. Silent treatment is the worst. Not only is it ineffective, it's extremely immature. Men are the same, until you TELL them what to do, they won't budge. So stop trying to 'give him the hint', and spell it out to him just as it is. Don't 'could you please this and that', you're just begging and pleading him. If he cannot show respect to you, return the courtesy. Start buying your own groceries, cook your own meal and do your own laundry. Tell him if he wants a share in all this, start doing it together. Marriage is after all, a partnership. You go thru everything together.|`|a984cQjKaa	if he's such a lazy jerk, and you only do things for him out of obligation, why don't you just leave him?|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Maybe this would help.  Quit expecting him to be like a woman. That seems to be the real reason for the problems. You expect him to "read your mind, know how you "feel" and it just doesn't work that way with us guys...You should ask him, and then later ask him again...not with attitude, lovingly, and then ask again...i know that sounds weird but bear with me...When he does the least little thing, praise him like he moved mountains ( we love that)...He will be more willing to do something again. I "expect" something. Guys just aren't "wired" that way. If your confrontational, it makes us dig in more.  My wife has trained me well. It took 16 years, but she did it. I found myself putting away dishes the other day...and I wait to see if she noticed, she came in clasped my face and said, you're just a great hubby"...hehehe loved it, like a puppy, what can I do now....she still asks 2 maybe three times but not NAGGING ( asking with attitude, you know, rolling the eyes ect...) And I get it done. You really don't know the power a woman holds until you do it right...and realize guys don't think like you.we are not complex...which is what you may think , we are really, really simple, ...perhaps you should change your approach and let me know if it works...|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Marriage is a partnership. Is he doing his part providing for you, or do you work also?<br>  <br>  If you both work, then you both share the house work also.  If only one works, then the other does the house work. It is called division of labor. <br>  <br>  At any rate, you have a lot of resentment that indicates you do not feel you have a caring relationship. Also you don't accept him for who he is, you want him to be someone he is not.<br>  <br>  You should consider separation and see how you feel after a time apart. I think you will find that once you are separated, you will want to find the person you really want.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sit down and talk about the chores and responsibilities around the house.  Create a chore list (you don't have to post it or anything) and divide up the chores...<br>  <br>  In my house - the rule is - if you cook supper - you don't do the clean up.  My husband does the laundry and I do all of the grocery shopping (the two tasks we like least we traded...I hate laundry!) - and so on and so forth...<br>  <br>  It will clear the air and set you both on the same page...If he doesn't follow through - remind him - when you've reminded him at least three time - go on strike!  One way or another - he'll eventually get the point.|`|bmWKETgWaa	This will take planning.  What you do, is you set up a teeny, tiny task that's right in his way, and if he doesn't do it, it delays or prevents something he wants.  For example, "Would you please put the forks, knives, and spoons at our places for dinner.  I've got to watch this frying pan every second so the food doesn't burn."  If he gives you static, let the food burn while you place the silverware.  You can give him the blackest portion. <br>  <br>  My husband has begun washing the pots and pans after meals.  He does this because the detergents make my fingers crack and bleed.  I make sure to tell him frequently how much I appreciate his doing that.  I load the dishwasher and empty it afterward.|`|djUMvICoaa	He wanted a maid or a second mommy to take care of him and you are.  Why should he change.  But I bet you saw all this before you were married didn't you?  But now you know he won't change, he laughs at a simple request and you are dying inside, you can't even find that love you once felt for him, it is already gone.  Time to get out of it.  You can't carry the load like that.  Any man worth a hoot would have at least pitched in when you were unloading about helping instead of laughing at you.  He has bullied you down, abused you mentally and you just threw out a life line for help.  Here it is, get out, you can do better and you deserve better, but you won't get it from him.  If you  have more questions write me.|`|xVecKF26aa	Sounds like my husband. lol He is like that too- I love him to death, but he just feels that it is my job to do everything in the home while he goes and works.  I understand that and took that responsiblity..but now we have a new baby and all my work seems to have doubled!<br>  It is very hard to manage EVERYTHING in your home and take care of him too!<br>  Next time he demands you to do something while you are busy just say, "I am sorry, my hands are full at the moment.  I can help you in 5 minutes." (Or however long)  He will probably just do it himself (if he is like my husband, he will grow impatient and do it himself)<br>  It is rough to be married to a man like that, I know believe me!  I also hold my feelings inside...Honestly I feel like I wrote this question! LOL<br>  <br>  I guess what we women need to do is to stand up for ourselves and tell our guys that marriage is a partnership and is a two way street.<br>  Explain that we need help too and we expect to be respected.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!|`|tlxG2q04aa	Does he have a job?|`|7V0zpsgOaa	WOW: WHAT A LOSER,did he come from cavemen or what?I have been married to the same women for the past 15yrs.,if i even thought about being 1/2 as rude i'd hope she would hit in my head!Have you tried talken to his parents?Maybe there the same.
Q7ALl9zeaa	Well, if it is a tradition to do things this way, at least they are not doing it because they don't like you. Wowzas though, it's a tough situation. If the bottom line is that you guys could not make it without his parents paying for what they do..then do what they are asking. In 2 years he is done with school, gets 30,000 and that will be a good down payment on a house..so why not move in together then? Can you stay with your parents or get a roommate, and maybe actually end up staying with your man part time..sneak some days and nights in here and there with him? I'm sure it's frustrating, but take it for what it is, and don't let it come between you guys. his parents seem to really care about his future success, and he is very lucky to have that. You and your man should maybe look ahead and also see the good that could come out of it. I agree that you don't really know someone well until you live with them, but it could be worse..they could demand you two never see each other or else. Good luck and just love each other no matter what.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	that is why i never asked my parents a single dime, and i moved out when i turned 18. <br>  <br>  tell him to try, it builds character.|`|2IUZ62NCaa	sorry the parents call the shots in this relationship...very familiar to me my parents use money to run my brothers life and mine.  Unless he's going to get some balls your out of luck...if he really was going to marry you he would put his parents in their place...also, why would you want to get married at 23 that's way too young?  and why would you want to marry a guy whose parents don't like you??  too many problems...|`|5brlJBGRaa	First it is not too soon for you guys to live together, you have been with eachother for 5 years now. Damn me and my man were living together after 3 months. My mom was the same way wanting me to marry him and his mom was against it (afraid of losing her son) But he loved me and we wanted to be together so we got married and his mom then had to deal with it because it was up to me and him not your mother or his mother. I would just talk to ur man and see how he feels about it, and if he really loves you and wants to be with you he will have your back and tell his mom what is up. I hope this helped... good luck|`|82oTjLCAaa	..well..not only that his parents doesn't allow him to marry unless he graduates but thier son also probably doesn't.it is not fair to live with a woman without being married..and a man s hould be able to understand if that is the woman he needs.but manny men don't care if that is the womna they need..they need the most and best and beautifull and intelligent..and don't give up..but put him to a test.ask him to marry you now..you need a wedding dress you can have it done by a private little fashion designer..etc..and you need a friend to give the house and garden for a day for wedding..you buy the food is not expensive and is far beter a wedding at a house then a wedding at a restaurant ..like is habit here..and with the money you received at wedding from guests you could buy a house somewhere at countriside..where no rent nor 1000per month.and you have where to go without spending fortunes in week ends.in town you can lend with less money around 200$a monthin a quiet nice place and find a job near your home..so you won't travel the whole city.to get home..my fiancee also said after i said yes..he said that actually his parents wanted him to marry at 30..such a clumsy man how could he say such a think..i should have left him that moment especially that we haven t slept togheter by that moment ..i mean making sex...when a man marries..he leaves his parents so is in the bible..if he loves more his parents then you that is not a man for you you need smn to rely on him who can wear you in his hand..such a boy,,,he wants a woman wants to sleep with her..but as for marriage doesn't matter when and lets his parents insults you..i would leave him..for smb with the head on his shoulders|`|8zvLL0qMaa	i would ask is parents why they dont get along with you soooo much anymore. i know u dont want to hear this but maybe you should respect their wishes too i mean they are paying 4 everthing. my sis got pregnant at 14 and my mom was pissed. to this day they dont like her husband. she married him when she was 18 and even though my mom loves her she was looking out for her best interest. maybe its a religous thing idk but i think you should talk with them and try nd work something out cause in the end it helps.|`|9W48OvAraa	Well your situation is a tough one!<br>  As for how his parents are treating him and you I would guess they want to be sure he graduates above all else and are providing the carrots and showing the stick to be sure he does. This is known as loving ones child and doing what they think is best. As for their apparent lack of "love" for you I would say it has nothing to do with "you" but rather they would be that way with anyone who posed a possible "threat" of their so not finishing school. Perhaps for moral reasons they choose not to allow you two to live together first. An FYI-Couples who live together prior to marriage actually have a high divorce rate that those who do not. Really!<br>  I know none of it seems fair but the truth is people are allowed to do whatever the heck they want with their own property and money.<br>  As for setting boundaries etc. if you two stay together around families the two of you will need to decide what works for both of you PRIOR to being married. I promise that being married to someone is much different than simply dating them or living with them.<br>  I wish my much luck on your journey!<br>  <br>  BC|`|kbz5S3waaa	unfortunately, they're not going to be out of the picture until he tells them he doesn't want them to be apart of his life, or they die, whichever is first....|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	*You* cannot do much; like it or not, you are an outsider in their family - even if you may be a well-liked outsider. Your fiancé is the one who should be dealing with the situation. If his parents acted as if they liked you one minute, and then turned around and now want you to stay as far away as possible the next - he needs to have a talk with them and find out exactly what's going on. He is their son, and he is the only one who can possibly make the situation better by being diplomatic with his family; there's really nothing you can do or say.<br>  <br>  Something to keep in mind - the ONLY way to do whatever you feel is right for you two is to be financially independent. For as long as there are purse strings attached, your fiancé will not be free to do what he feels is right in his situation. Both of you have to choose: obey the parents' wishes and keep receiving financial assistance, or strike out on your own, do whatever you feel is right for you (live together, etc.) and forego the parents' money. This really what it comes down to.<br>  <br>  If you're independent, and you choose to do something his parents don't approve of, it might not be such a big deal after a while. They may be unhappy initially, but if they're normal well-adjusted people, they will get over it eventually if they see that your relationship is going well and whatever you're doing is working out for you. You'll just have to weather the initial storm. But with money involved, it's more complicated, and you will have to struggle financially if you decide to do things on your own and they withdraw financial support.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	His parents are well within their rights to do these things. If he doesn't want to do what they ask then he can find his own place, buy his own car and get a school loan. That way he can do what he wants. You'd be wise to try and get along with them. They are in his life forever. You may not be.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You are going to have simply accept their wishes.<br>  Since you are form outside of their culture, anything their son does that displeases them will end up being "your fault".<br>  <br>  Don't rust to marry...but until you do, you're just "the girlfriend", and therefore not their concern. <br>  <br>  I suspect they are also catholic...and when you went on that vacation, I am betting you slept in separate rooms. You don't have to do what they wish...but you also can't force them to give their son what was promised unless he abides their wishes. <br>  <br>  Remember...these will be your in laws.<br>  They can make you life miserable...and they will if they feel you are leading their son away from their "traditions".You and your fiance can do what you wish...but there will be financial consequences if you do...and you know ahead of time.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.|`|bO2rzfISaa	So, your "fiancé" can easily be controlled by money and things (car, house). This will never end. When he grows up, they will help him buy a house and they will dictate terms to him about that. <br>  <br>  You are too young to marry (WHAT is your mom thinking?), but imo, he is to much of a child to refuse anything from his mommy and daddy, and that makes him too much of a child to be anyone's fiancé.<br>  <br>  They have plans for their little boy, and they don't include you. He's willing to accept all they want to give him. Don't you see how pathetic that is?<br>  <br>  You're a real, grown up threat now and that's why they've changed their opinion about you.|`|krQiDGCHaa	He needs to stop accepting all help from his parents.<br>  <br>  It will be hard financially at first, but he needs to tell them that he loves you, and lay down the law.  You two are both adults, and if you want to live together, you have every right to.  You have every right to do whatever you want.  Find a cheap studio apartment and be cramped for a few years until you can afford everything on your own.<br>  <br>  STOP relying on his parents for anything.  He needs to put his foot down with them and tell them that if they don't approve of you, that's too bad.  Honestly, I think he should stop talking to them altogether if they cannot show you a little respect.  You're going to be his wife!  He needs to tell them how it is and let them know that he will not converse with people who treat his "wife" poorly or talk poorly about her.<br>  <br>  My husband had to lay down the law with his mother when it came to me.  It was hard at first, but things have settled down now, 2 years later.  I still dont' like her, but I'm nice to her for the sake of family peace.  I DO NOT take any of her crap, though -- and you and your fiance shouldn't, either.<br>  <br>  (By the way, Fiancee is a woman, Fiance is a man) :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Unfortunately, when you marry this guy you will also be marrying his family, and he yours. That's simply how it is, so try getting along with them for all your sakes. Just be the charming, intelligent girl that your finance fell in love with and his parents are sure to follow.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Tell your fiance to grow up or he won't last in marriage that long. He's a big BOY now and he should not be accepting things from his parents specially when they are trying to manipulate you two. I know this is hard but just wait till you get married things are going to be even harder.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	They are Filipino and if that is you in the picture you obviously are not. Are they hoping he will marry a Filipino woman?|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	be polite and diplomatic<br>  good luck!|`|AA10874773	first of all, you dont need to do anything.  your fiance on the other hand, should tell them you are engaged and that if you cant live there, he wont either.  simple as that.  they changed your plans, he can change theirs  - as far as what they will do with the house now.  good luck!|`|FsmcCXlvaa	This doesn't look good for you. His parents own him right now and unless he's ready to cut financial ties with his parents he's giving them the green light to call the shots. This isnt up to you, it's up to him. His parents know exactly what they are doing and they are getting exactly what they want. As long as he accepts the money and support from them, he's accepting the 'rules' that go with it. He basically needs to choose between having the money and going with his parents wishes OR cutting financial ties with them and doing as he wishes with you. If his parents pay his school, car, living expenses... he's basically bought and paid for by his folks. Not much for you to do about it unless he's willing to walk away from their support. If he's worth the wait then you have a decision to make about how you'll support yourself and where you'll live. This is just the beginnng with the future in-laws and it isn't pretty. You are very young and maybe they think they are doing you a favor. But if this situation is going to change it's your fiancee that will need to make it happen. He needs to talk to his parents and let them know what he wants and see if they can compromise. Otherwise you're looking at plan b.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Just do it. Remember when you were younger...a little girl, and you hated your parents telling you what to do? You are a young adult now, and being told what not to do for your own good. "His" parents know what they are doing, and feel that education comes first. Bite your lip...say nothing, and do what they feel is right. If you follow through they will look at you as a good person for their son. Don't worry. Time will come, and go...eventually you will get married, and you guys will be making the rules. This is something that I went through and did what I felt was right for my now wife (nine years) and all is better. It was tough...I have stories to tell, but I made the decision to keep the peace between me and my mother in law. She finished school, got her degree, we bought our house...etc...and still there were other challenges to overcome in life. Don't worry, you'll be fine...GL|`|s7seaaPkaa	Wicked Ways:: that is so wrong.<br>  anyways you marry him not his family my mother in law does almost the same things .<br>  all you should do is always be polite you need to kill em with kindness.<br>  and also so they never have anything bad to say about you.<br>  then your fiance needs to step up and let them know hes gonna marry you one day and they have no say in it.<br>  so they except both of you or none at all.<br>  thats when my husband did.<br>  but my M.I.L is so stubborn she picked to leave us behind.
dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	She did this and she did that.  Sounds to me like your dad allows everything that she did/does in exchange for companionship.  <br>  <br>  feel sorry for him instead of butting heads.  call him to arrange one to one visitation with your dad who allows the woman in his life to be separated from his kids.  remember, he ALLOWS it.<br>  <br>  It's always sad when a parent behaves more immature than his children.  But I'll bet your mother took care of him as if he was a baby.  His weakness following your mother's untimely death made him prey to a controlling woman.  But the bottom line here is that if he cared, he wouldnt allow her to separate you from him.  <br>  <br>  If you dont continue contact with your dad, she wins.  And he's too weak to care or do anything about it.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	respect that he is a grown man that has chosen his life situation. you should get him out for walk to talk. tell him what & how you feel. then listen to his response. if your worried about money you should have your own. well i wouldn't want my kids having keys for my place to invite them selves over when ever they wanted either.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	let no one come in between you and your father.  Shame on him for letting this woman do these things.  Get together with him and put yourself back into his life.  If she doesn't like it, well say goodbye to her!  She sounds like a self absorbed money hungry byotch!|`|7q4BVzvJaa	no you are always suposed to respect your father no matter what because deep down he loves you no parent will ever disrespect you.|`|78KkLagGaa	you should respect your father.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	My dad recently got married and she has tried her best to block us and him. I know how you feel it is so sad.<br>  <br>  Just stay stong and be there no matter what.
RLT5ArT8aa	Men admit time and time again that they are in general not very good with remembering dates, being romantic, cleaning up after themselves, etc.  At least when a major holiday is coming up like Christmas or Valentine's there are decorations everywhere, commercials, and tv and radio shows bringing it up constantly and doing a countdown.  Even the most forgetful of men cannot escape these occasions.<br>  <br>  Your poor husband clearly needs a helping hand, he is after all your sidekick.  All women have to be the superheroes in their relationships.  So just ask Robin if he wants to spend the wedding anniversary with you.  Unless he's suicidal or suffering from stupidity, he will not say no.  If he does there is a quick remedy to jump start his brain and that's a swift kick to the crotch.  It quickly reboots the male system and you can reprogram him.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, do not withhold your true feelings from him it only hurts the both of you.|`|b9fgNm8taa	You should not have to remind him but guys are awful with dates. This is your husband of five year, you should spend your anniverisay together but you dont have to. If it is bothering you talk to him about it. You been married 5 years dont hold back. Your not being pushy your telling how you feel and you would hope he would understand that and want to be with you that day. Be honest and don't hide your feelings away this is your husband.. *hugs*|`|6DwBz05jaa	Lots of men forget important dates. Put a calender up somewhere he won't miss it, with the date circled (in red) and "5 year anniversary" written clearly. <br>  <br>  My husband told me years ago that he was terrible about forgetting birthday etc. He asked me to please remind him, and I don't mind.<br>  <br>  Playing games is never good. I wouldn't advise waiting till the night and giving him a nice gift and card with the intent of making him feel like a jerk. <br>  <br>  If you remind him and he STILL wants to watch UFC, gather up your friend and go to Vegas! :)|`|46xuKWyEaa	I get what your saying, but honestly that's f-ed up.  It's your wedding anniversary!  I mean if it's like the 2 month anniversary of a kiss at Jiffylube that's one thing, but your wedding anniversary! He should know better.  And you do have a right to ***** him out...you shouldn't have to remind him about your wedding anniversary, he should remember.  If I were you I would tell wait until Friday, wait till his friends got there, and then give him something small and be like "happy 5 yr annivesary sweety", give him a kiss on the cheek and tell him to enjoy his night, and go do something w/ your girlies.  It may be a total ***** move, but trust me it'll work and I promise you he will never forget again!|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Awe... <br>  Has he remembered every other year?  Listen, if he really did forget you have to forgive him.  One day you will forget something important to him.  When he says something about his plans for that night - say, "oh that really stinks, it's our anniversary" (very casual).  You can say that nicely and suprised like. :)  He may feel really bad for not even thinking about what date the game fell on.  Say that and then say, why don't we do something special that day before the fight or choose another day.  That would be pretty sweet of you!  Soon enough those silly UFC fights will be over.|`|gIqRs5buaa	Ok so people forget stuff, I do even if i really don't want to. So just because he's forgotten doesn't mean that he's done it on purpose. I think you have to be honest with him, and if you don't want an argument just joke with him. <br>  <br>  Say something like 'Oh so you're going out with the lads on our wedding anniversary!, you better have a big surprise waiting to make up for this one!'<br>  <br>  But he may well have forgotten on purpose which is a little more tricky, and you may have to have a serious talk with him, maybe say you dont expect a lot but want to at least spend some time together on your special day.<br>  <br>  Hope you resolve the situation.|`|l50LNHYKaa	Your husband has to understand he married you you are his wife and he has to understand moments like parties anniversaries and other things will come along and he cant just blow them off. celebrating an anniversary is a very important thing in marrige and by him acting the way he is is showing that he doesnt care which is unfair to you. you need to let him know that its ur anniversary and you want to go out and do something to celebrate it. if he argues then do something with ur friends, but then find a way to punish him for it like mayb no sex, or accidently dissconect the cable, or mayb dont even clean up after him. thats kinda what i did with my boyfriend and when he saw i treated him the same way he treated me he got his act up together and started acting like a man.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Most guys are bad at remembering dates. Help him out and remind him. It's not pushy and demanding. You're his WIFE, you're allowed to remind him that his friends come second. So tell him to spend Friday with you, he can drink with his buddies another time.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you're going to stew and be all passive aggressive toward him and "punish" him for doing something else on your anniversary, then YES PLEASE SAY SOMETHING TO HIM AND REMIND HIM ABOUT THE ANNIVERSARY.  Men are clueless and self absorbed when they get focused on something like a sport they are interested in.<br>  <br>  If you really don't care if he does something else on your anniversary, then go ahead and make your own plans and go enjoy yourself.|`|oojO4WAraa	Go out with your girlfriends.  Have a good time.  Spend the night over at one of their houses.   Leave him a card or something so when he comes home to an empty house he realizes what an *** he is.  Then he will probably want to take you out to dinner on Saturday.|`|StJGeiFyaa	maybe he does remember and he is trying to surprise you. don't make plans and give him the benefit of the doubt. if after that you realize he really doesn't remember, then do something else.|`|IBKtma8Jaa	You should let him know how you feel.  He is hurting your feelings, but may not even be aware that he is doing it.  Make plans to do something fun for both of you and talk to him ahead of time.  Treat it like a first date, with you being the one who asks.  If he doesn't play along and still wants to drink with friends...well...there are too many fish in the sea.  Respect yourself, girl. But don't expect him to read your mind.|`|uzGIdiFdaa	To start off I'll say this, sometimes we forget, but most guys know what month it's in or about what date. Your husband sounds like he didn't forget, he just doesn't care, or both. You can make him feel real bad by buying something really nice, something he's always wanted, then give it to him just before he goes out. That coupled with a real sweet and loving card. He'll be shocked. The look on his face will be worth it, and he'll feel like crap the rest of the night, or he might just feel so guilty that he'll decide to stay with you. If he looks shocked and cancels his plans with the boys then he just forgot. If he says thanks and goes out anyways then he just doesn't care, and if that happens you need to talk to him and find out whats going on and maybe consider counseling. I'm sorry you feel so bad, but this really is the time to talk. Good luck
FZKFLTyLaa	Am i setting myself up for failure? should i even bother?<br>  There's no way we, as readers of this question can determine that. You may make whatever effort you feel worthy in this pursuit. If it's genuine, and not just an infatuation, you should at least try to find her.
jiqcLFdvaa	I would make amends and feel a little guilty if you were actually a good guy...and I would also have beaten up my boyfriend and probably pummelled him near to death..lool. but I wouldn't come to you for your money, because I am the person who looks beyond money. Just don't flash your money around because then you won't kno if she does act interested in you.|`|lbHSs5UGaa	it would really depend if i loved him or not.<br>  if i did, i would try and find you again, but i would be wary that you really would treat me like a queen because i had been treated badly before.  I would be hurt that you didnt try and get me away earlier.<br>  if i didnt love him, well too bad.|`|rtk02g0gaa	i persoanlly think she has no cofidence obviously if she is going to let some guy hit her.

ze4Gt1araa	I woulda dumped the stupid guy that would hit me and be with the nice guy but I'll be with the nice guy for HIM not for his MONEY. Make sure if you start talking to her that she likes you and wants you for you NOT for the money. Watch out!

I mean, that means you're doing something right. If I were her, I'd be sad because that would mean you could take care of us, (and a future family?)<br>  Plus she left you for a jerk! I would probably feel pretty dumb and hurt and prideful. I'd be too afraid to talk to you 1) bc I treated that way, why would you want to talk to me that way? 2) I would feel like you deserved much better than the way I treated you in the past (even though people change, we still judge others on what they have done to us in the past) 3) If you were really my friend the issue of money wouldn't be why I'd probably be attracted to you, but it would be extra motivation I guess.<br>  4) Saying she isn't interested any at all in you, the worst thing she can say to you is "I don't like you,never speak to me again."<br>  Lets face it, if she's that terrible, there are other girls who will love you for who you are, not what you do for a living, how much money you make, or what you've done in the past.<br>  That's how I would feel. I really don't know what I would do, its a pretty sticky situation.|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	well i would have realized what i missed by now and say to myself<br>  damn why am i so flippin stupid i could have everything i wanted but no im stuck with a flippin idiot who doesnt give a sh!t about me~<br>  well thats what i would say<br>  hope it helps in anyway|`|w6DJj1a8aa	if i was her and you were my ex and i saw you in your car or whatever i would be very happy for you and second run up to you and give you a really big hug and hold you for a little bit and cry and just i don't know what else i would do next/
QhRO0kcMaa	There are several types of people. Some are leaders and some are always led. As for me, I usually let the other lead if they seem capable. As for you, since you couldn't stand up to your friend, you're more like the introverted, conflict-avoiding, goodie goodie girl.<br>  <br>  You have to learn to get a hold of your courage.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to stay away from a friend like her. Personally, I don't know how you treat someone like that a friend. I'd just ignore the hell out of her and shout at her if she starts nagging like that. And you can tell her, "You're being a b*tch right now, you know that?" It would be offensive, but you're also doing your friend good, since if you don't tell her, she won't know. And she'll end up as a 60-year-old grannies who always yell at their neighbors. :)|`|ugCaMO3saa	just be straight forward with her.

Uj5kuzoJaa	A lot of times when a girl stays with a guy even though he's not treating her right, it's usually because the girl doesn't want to be alone. Here in America a lot of people are afraid that they'll be lonely their whole life and die alone. I know it's ridiculous but it's the truth. She also might really love him and is willing to accept the things he does to her. It's most likely NOT about sex, but more about how she feels. Maybe she likes all the attention she gets because of it even if it is negative. He also might be very convincing when he tells her that he'll never do that again. Many girls believe these lies because they don't want to be alone and they love the person. But they need to realize that no matter how much you love someone, there is no excuse for them to treat you in any way other than how you want to be treated. Let the girl know that there are other guys out here who would treat her better and love her more than her current boyfriend. Be careful when you talk to her because she might not want to listen and might get mad at you. Just try to be there for her and convince her that it's time to move on and get in a healthy relationship. If you have any questions for me you can email me at<br>  <br>   my_heart_is_urs06@yahoo.com<br>  <br>   instead of here on yahoo answers.

cjaEHwEvaa	I do not agree that this is fair. It was incredibly selfish. To get back at your wife you potentially ruined their relationship. You should have divorced her or tried to save your marriage. <br>  <br>  A 46 year old should be above going online to seek approval for such an act, using words like "masterful" and telling us just how quickly you came. <br>  <br>  If you want a high-five, you can f**k off elsewhere.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	EW. You are related by law and that is disgusting. <br>  You all need serious help. A marriage is not about retaliation, its about working out issues. <br>  Obviously you had a big issue and decided to be a pervert about it. And your step daughter was embarrassed, so I'm calling sexual abuse on making her give you a hand job.|`|AA10496297	good fantasy, I guess - if that's what you are into. But to make it even better - you should have added the wife caught you and the step daughter in the act and joined in.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	That is wrong on so many levels. You, your wife and your sexually disturbed stepdaughter are all mentally disturbed and need to seek counseling.<br>  <br>  Not only does this have "Jerry" writen all over it, Can we say creepy Lifetime movie!|`|HQ4t7JfGaa	this is funny to read haha   guys read it all is funny <br>  <br>  erm lets get back to the story <br>  dump ur wife go with the her daughter end of story|`|cMsC5a14aa	I see an episode of Divorce Court or Jerry Springer in the making|`|3gljWitCaa	you both are sick<br>  and totally deserve eachother :)<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|5Lw7feUkaa	You're both as bad as eachother... in fact you could be worse... 19 year old step daughter?

I am speechless.|`|mldo1vxYaa	This cant be a serious question, no it is definitely not '' fair '' !!! You have slept with your step daughter, someone who you reared since at least the age of 12 obviously younger as I assume you didnt marry the mother as soon as you met her. This is all too sick and you have created something which you can never come back from, you now have no choice but to walk away. Her daughter is still only a teen, how could you do that?|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I think you're dreaming.  none of this happened except the part about your wife cheating on you, and I can't blame her.  do her a favor and get a damn divorce.|`|0Id85yiYaa	you and your wife deserve each other|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wow....the proper thing to do would have been to just leave.  any chance of you guys EVER getting past her cheating is now gone, null, and void.<br>  <br>    though at this point id say your both so sick you deserve each other.|`|AA10873763	You're vindicated, the daughter needs therapy and your wife will never be able to look her in the eye again.<br>  Good job.

On another note:<br>  <br>  Take a min and think, is there anything that your spouse could do that would make you leave them?<br>  <br>  If you could think of even one thing you do not unconditionally love your spouse.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a disgustingly disfunctional family to me.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Oh.

No, that's disgusting to me.

2KC467tFaa	You know your options. I have no intention on swaying your decision. I will advise you to do things that make you happy. It's our job to make ourselves happy. If both of you work on yourselves, things will be much better when you do talk to each other. If you feel like you need space, take it. True loves don't leave or will boomerang back to you. Try to get into yoga or some form of meditation to help with stress and low tolerance levels. You could also take a step back and focus on the friendship aspect of the relationship. It's much easier to talk to people if you know they're your friends. Maybe there's too much pressure on the relationship. Work on yourselves, and go from there. Pick up a new relaxing hobby. Learn how to make pottery, paint, knit, or whatever will help you relax. Stress does immense amounts of damage to our bodies, relationships, confidence, and life. Try to find inner peace. Things will "fall" into place once you feel contentment. Good luck!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. I understand how you feel. Relationships do take a lot of work. I think the best the for you to do, is to find some time to have a long talk with your bf and see how he is really feeling, tell him how you feel. Im sure you guys can sort it out. Maybe he feels the same way you do. Are you sure also, that you are happy having a long distance relationship? I think they are fine to have, as long as the couple is very in love and willing to make the relationship work. Are you two willing to keep your relationship strong even though you live in different cities now? These are all things that you two need to discuss. Good luck to you. Everything will work out the way its meant to.|`|OauZKhKVaa	I'm sorry to say it, but long-distance relationships rarely work. You both might be happier going separate ways. Good luck with everything.|`|0756dc620f7e85830cd5e318d021d602aa	When you visit him, sit him down and talk to him. Make sure you get your point across.|`|prDi2u4faa	It sounds like your not his top priority, which isn't good. In a healthy relationship you should be number one. If that's not so you need to break it off. I understand it'll be painful because it seems to me like you really love this guy. But it also seems like he slowly drifted from you, so you need to drift away too. Don't keep hurting yourself with wondering if he's the one or anything. Just think, if you couldn't see yourself marrying him like this then why waste your time lingering.|`|wZb7zilKaa	Work on yourself and your personal issues.  He sounds like a good hard working guy and that he has a lot on his plate.  When you go to visit him in a week try not to fight with him.  Try to be peaceful and enjoy the time you are spending with him.  It sounds like he is under a lot of pressure and you should do your best to not add to it.

6VhcygKsaa	Well it sounds like there should be and intervention on her part. Sounds like she is just throwing away her life to smoking pot...If your a true friend you would talk to a counselor or even her parents.. She may not like it when you do, But she will thank you for it later..... I have been there. Don't let her throw away her life and that's just what she will do..  You see it has already affected her grades.  And it seems to me that someone has gotten to her to smoke pot. I would try to find out who that is....  They are not a true friend... Hope she gets the help that she needs before its too late|`|3wIumdJzaa	If you're a real friend you'll bring it to the attention of her parents, don't look at it as telling on her but making sure that they do something to help her, if her parents are not the type of people that you can talk to bring it to the attention of a teacher or someone who can get her the help she needs. look at it this way if you do nothing and she get behind the wheel or something wouldn't you feel bad that you could have brought it to the attention of someone who could have gotten her some help be a friend and do the right thing.|`|3lrUuuroaa	hi, i have actually been in tha place of your friend. It took my little cousin to tell me that i was scaring her before i changed. i just had to realize that what i was doing was really hurting me, and not making me have fun. try to be understanding because i am sure your friend doesn't know what to do. these kinds of things can get addicting. I would be serious with her, and tell her how you feel, and that you are worried about her. she might be mad at you for a little while, but she will thank you in the end.|`|9W48OvAraa	That is a tough situation for sure.<br>  Have you tried talking with her alone and letting her know how much you care for her and ask how you can be of support?

You can also find help through a school counselor or online-<br>  Good luck with your friend<br>  <br>  BC|`|k29um5Phaa	talk to her..let her know you will help her whatever..<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  can u answer my qestion on my profile..please|`|0myrXJKMaa	This is going to be really hard to do but my advice is to confront her parents. Since she is in high school (most likely a minor) it is really your best and most effective option. Call her parents and set a time to meet them somewhere. Bring your other friend along for support. Tell them you are doing this out of true concern. It is hard for parents to hear bad things about their own children so do not be suprised if they are on the defensive. Write down everything you want to say before you go, so you have it in writing and avoid getting side-tracked. Then it is up to the parents to confront their child and get the proper help. Good luck I hope it turns out ok|`|Y9eSvxzQaa	Trust me I know how difficult it is when someone you know is going down a bad path.  I don't know the number off hand but there is a drug crisis  number.  Ask your guidance counselor for that and more information.  You should also talk to her parents and let them know what is going on with their daughter
AA11356977	He was never into you so why go back and waste time on something that is one sided and dead ended. Its just a part of life time to move on and find a guy that is into you. If you txt him you will only feel ilke a looser.|`|SPhq1BFUaa	Oh yeah totally, there's no harm in sending him a casual text message. Just text him say something simple like "Hey, I haven't talked to you in awhile and I just wanted to see whats going on" and just carry out the conversation. If you find out that hes not seeing anyone then just ask him if he wants to go out for a coffee (or whatever lol) or if he wants to grab a bite so the two of you can catch up. See if you still actually have feelings for him and if you do then start flirting up a storm, and then if you feel comfortable at some point tell him you used to like him a lot and those feelings are starting to come back now that you've seen him again.|`|JNwkb66Naa	Go for it! You never know, things might have changed. But at the same time be careful because if they didn't, you don't want to get your heart broken. If you don't text him and see how things are between you two you'll regret not knowing what could have been.|`|QZ1siB8Qaa	Text him. If you don't, you will always wonder 'what if' You may come to find out, that he has been wanting to text you as well, and has the fear/hesitation of doing it. Send a casual message, if he doesn't respond, you'll know. Good luck!!
mydVjC4xaa	Well, love is a very important emotion. It's also important to be past all those bubblie feelings when you're with your love, your soul mate, the one you want to spend the rest of your life with. Sometimes I have a low self-esteem and so he tells me everyday how beautiful i am and how much he loves me. We are each other's first, we waited until marriage. I am he first and last girlfriend.<br>  So now we are married. It's been a month now and we are still good. Some say that it is hard to get over the first year but I know we will make it because God is at the head of our relationship. It is very important to have your relationship with God and through God.<br>  Take a look at all the hollywood stars who get married and end their relationship so fast and over stupid stuff and cheat.<br>  It's because they got in the relationship for the bubblie feelings and the fame and the money, nothing more. God is not with them in that relationship.<br>  When you marry, it is for life, it is not to be broken.<br>  Anywayz our relationship is great.<br>  On Valentines Day he bought me a car and a diamond necklace! I had to work that day but when I got home I found our room redecorated with a new, bigger, more comfortable bed with a beautiful bed spread. It was so nice. He hasn't done anything that big for me before. I usually don't make him buy me anything or even ask for much. He just did it. I love my husband! But I love him for who he is not just because he buys me stuff.|`|RiIy8JQCaa	I love my boyfriend so much. He's so hot and he's even got a six pack! We're both seventeen and he treats me as if I'm the only other person in the world. He loves me for who I am and doesn't try and change me.

f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	I don't share my partners.  But if your boyfriend said it, rest assured he isn't playing and he wants to try it. That doesn't mean you have to do it.  Honestly think about this... do you want to share your man with another woman? And how will you feel when he starts being more attentive to her in the sack? It's just a bad idea if you are in a relationship in my opinion. Ask him if he would be open to having another man join you in the bedroom.. I'm guess he will say something like "i don't' want some other dude nailing my woman!"  so the question is do you want your man nailing another girl while you watch?  I think it shows a real lack of self respect and loyalty to go through with that if you are in a "committed" relationship.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Yeah its fun but choose the people you do it with VERY carefully. Most guys will prefer to do it with 2 girls, rathen than a girl and another guy. Make sure all the people are comfortable with eachother and not attached to eachother emtionaly. This can cause allot of problems during the proceedings! haha. I have always wanted to do it with 2 guys (im a girl) but its hard finding 2 guys who wont mind seeing eachother naked. Bisexuals or gay guys are great for this but I don;t know many that are willing to have a go! haha|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I've been involved in a few. There lots of fun but its best to be single when you partake in one. And if you or your partner is the slightest bit jealous it can ruin your relationship. I have seen couples break up over threesomes so be careful and have fun, lol.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	I would have considered it before I met my boyfriend. Now he's the only one I want to share that level of intimacy with.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	It can cause a lot of problems.  Yopu have to be very mature and have a high level of communication with your partner before even deciding to take on something like a 3some.  Rules have to be in place - like who can touch who & where.  Think long & hard (no pun intended) before even thinking about trying something like that.|`|8uvLG8Lbaa	would cause problems in a serious relationship<br>  either way.<br>  those who agree with it.. 2 girls 1 guy, both usually enjoy it.<br>  2 guys 1 girl, girl enjoys it, but it sucks for the guy.<br>  unless you know how you both feel, its a dumb idea.|`|AA10266072	Me and my ex had quite a few of them.

Oral with the other girl was ok but no intercourse.<br>  <br>  The other rule was that we had to be drunk too!  Haha.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	I've often wondered, but never had one.

When there's another woman involved (which it is usually) it can be quite daunting watching your partner get excited over her, touching her etc, seeing how much he's enjoying it. And some women will get a massive inferiority complex after that, that they'll never get over. Others though, can see how much fun their partner is having, and find that a turn on, because they know their relationship is so secure. <br>  Just try to picture him with another woman and see how it makes you feel.|`|BwGOjB1Raa	Wouldn't you feel weird having sex with a random person that doesn't have you emotionally?  Wouldn't you feel wierd letting your boyfriend see another guy have sex with you?  Wouldn't you get angry if he was enjoying another female's sex in front of your face?  He doesn't have a problem with a extra female but i bet he would with an extra dude.  Don't do it and thats coming from a male.|`|AD5cue8Waa	well if you think you can handle your boyfriend and another boy/girl at the same time then go for it. but dont expect that to help your relationship with your bf. because it could possibly make him want to keep doing things like that and not be satisfied with just you. but maybe not. who knows? if your serious about your bf then i wouldnt do it. but if you just want to have fun go for it.|`|F3ysG4Zzaa	Mmmmm...too weird. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I like the idea of sharing it with just one person. I'm going to sound like such a girl, but I think that it would make it more special.<br>  <br>  But, if you're into having a good time and trying things that are new and slightly crazy, then go for female-female-male.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I think that's really low.<br>  <br>  That means that you don't satisfy him enough so that's why he needs a 3rd person to satisfy him. Also, that means he doesn't love enough asking you this, because a guy that really loves a girl wouldn't ask her this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OS24ICPRaa	that could cause jealousy...would you be okay watching your bf get turned on by another girk and touching her intimatly? if that wouldnt make u upset then maybe if it would, then dont do it you will regret it.|`|CHazGLY3aa	i think everybody thinks about it but not many do it...i'd like to do it but it would have to be with 2 females i knew and trusted...if you want to do it then go for it but be careful|`|7Rd2SYdtaa	Well if he really wants it, would you want to share him with another girl?<br>  <br>  or is he doing two guys and you haha..? if that then, well forget about it|`|QI4uBnPUaa	Id never share my boyfriend, thats just a way for him to cheat while you being a part of it|`|MmSGeD2Eaa	if your okay with your boyfriend kissing up on some other girl and **** then thats all on you ;)|`|z9hyTp0jaa	we cant tell u weather to have a 3sum or not as we all have different opinions on  it.|`|6Nuaqihpaa	I don't know if I would do it, but I have nothing against them.|`|tlxG2q04aa	I'm in favour of it.|`|WvevK4n0aa	I would never do it,i'd never share my partner with another|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Yes,it is a lot of fun....but its also the fastest way to ruin a relationship.<br>  <br>   The only 3some I will ever have in the future is ME+my GF+ our bed !|`|IPS3hWweaa	Great!

88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Since everyone invited to the shower should also be invited to the wedding, they will be anticipating a wedding invitation.  It makes no difference if they get it before or after the shower.  Send the wedding invitations out in enough time for people to respond so you can get final numbers to your caterer.|`|sGP6s7uraa	You're supposed to get shower invites before wedding invites.  Shower invites usually need to be sent 2-3 weeks before the shower date so it gives people more time to buy you a gift (if they so choose) and to make accomodations for that day (if they have kids, appointments, etc).|`|eSkNDqLKaa	Well, you didn't say what the wedding date was, but I would have to guess it's possibly in May??? Why not send out the invitations on March 12th or 13th, although it really doesn't matter as I'm guessing that anyone receiving a wedding invitation will have been invited to the shower and if they hadn't, so what!|`|FnskUYpqaa	I think most people send out wedding invitations before the day of the shower. Because the shower is usually 1 month before wedding and your supposed to send out wedding invitations 2 months before the wedding. So it's fine to do it now before your bridal shower.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	Ideally you want them to go out after your shower thank yous.  I would quickly send out the thank you's and then a day or so after that send out the wedding invitations.<br>  <br>  Sending out the invitations prior to the thank you's is like saying "great, now get me another gift".|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Have your guests e-mail or call you for their RSVPs.  Don't wait for them to respond by mail.  You would need to call them.<br>  <br>  Weddings are romantic and things are done in an elegant and easy manner (on the surface, of course.)  We all know that planning a wedding is very stressful and you don't have the time to make phone calls.  However, in your case, you are going to need to speed things up.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tqFdbFPNaa	The shower invites should be sent out 2-3 weeks a head of time so people can plan around them. also wedding invites should be sent out 6-8 weeks a head of time so people can plan around them as well.
3gljWitCaa	if you have to ask then yes its too young|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	age is just a number.  if you're ready to be married it depends on the maturity of yourself and the relationship.  there are people who are twice your age who aren't ready for marriage, but maybe you are.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Nope... I was 23 (only a week before turning 24) when my fiancee popped the question and I'll be 25 when we actually get married.  He will be 27, going on 28.<br>  <br>  If you feel you are ready, then go for it!! :)  It doesn't matter the age, as long as you know you are ready to commit to this person for the rest of your life :)|`|29I8PWrxaa	If you are asking then to me that means you aren't yet ready.  But I can tell you that my fiance and I are 23 and 24 right now and getting married next June by which time we will be 24 and 25.  When we got engaged in December 2008 we had been together two years and living together for one.  No one has given us a hard time or said we are too young.  We are both mature and have a plan for the future as far as how we will be supporting ourselves and such, how long til we will have children, how we will be paying for the wedding, how we will be paying off student loans, etc.  If you don't have a plan for those types of things, then it doesn't matter how old you are, you aren't ready.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Everyone is different and everyone's maturity and readiness for marriage in their relationship is different. I have met men in their 30's that were no more ready for marriage than a 16 year old teenage boy. You ages are fine. I am 20, will be 21 when I get married and my fiance will be almost 27 when we get married. Everyones readiness is gaged differently. If you feel ready, most likely she is too! Good luck!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Nope.  I've looked at a few different studies which look at how your age at the time of your marriage correlates with your likelihood to get divorced and to have a satisfying marriage, and 24 is generally a pretty good age to be married.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i was 23 and had been with him for 1 year when we got engaged. so, i'd say no.|`|Bm4cPW8naa	Absoluetly not! I personally view it not about the age but about the committment to one another and how you feel... it also sounds like you have been together a good amount of time and you thought it through... good luck, hope she says yes!|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	My personal age is 25. But I think that you guys will be fine. Especially if you have been together for almost 3yrs at that point and have been living together for so long. I think you are on the right path.Good luck|`|EZzZE544aa	If you have already lived together that means you know each other well enough.if you can afford your living why not then?<br>  A happy married life is the best thing in the world|`|5dd9437d2887d5800d393adb8a4b516faa	I don't think so at all.  I am 24, turning 25 in mid-aprila bnd getting married end of may|`|tqFdbFPNaa	no its not to young.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I'm 21. So no. I don't think it is.<br>  <br>  Side note: Caps just make me think the person is immature. So annoying.|`|8fT10Lvbaa	no at all......|`|c62dd304bac916a0f0b3ead296d41785aa	That's a hard question, but at the same time I feel like I wished I had waited. In my 30's now and feel like now I maybe ready. I think people get married to young. You may not think you are to young, but after you get older you realize all that you want and need from a mate in all areas. You just don't marry, because your in love and disregard any issues you may have. You think about the little things that get on your nerves that the other person does, because right now it seems small, but later it is a big deal to you. Good luck and I wish you the best.|`|q6GnofENaa	The first thing I noticed is that there's all these numbers and calculations in your question. Personally, I think that if you know you love some one and want to marry them, marry them.  Whenver you want to, you should.  I'm 19 getting married in about 6 months, yes my fiancee is 26 and we're both financially stable and responsible for ourselves, but still it really doesn't matter. So don't think too much and just do whatever your heart tells you.|`|gk0fao0Saa	only if your a virgin.|`|AA12038794	No ask her///if you have prayed and feel she is the one
iPNOVR6Gaa	What's bizarre to me is that while you apparently do recognize that he's a momma's boy, you are ignoring the fact that he is a bigot.  I cannot imagine how in the world it is possible for you to be OK with being called an immodest, uncultured slut.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Do you not see the red flags in this relationship, hello!  Why are you wasting your time on this guy.  I not only would leave this relationship I would run away as fast as I could.  You never want to get involved with a mommas boy, you need to be looking for someone with the same goals in life as yourself.  So bail out now, stop all contact, and go out with your friends and live life while your young, you will have plenty of time to spend it with someone that compliments your personality and lets you grow into the person you wish.  Good luck.|`|m81dfyOYaa	If he treats his mother like that, that's how he'll treat you. He wants you to be like his mother so that you can be a servant for him and he can hurl abuse at you when he feels like it. Mommy takes it, wifey/gf should. You know you should get out of this relationship, love doesn't conquer all. Start making new friends, go out with your old friends and try to phase this guy completely out of your life and don't look back. Good Luck.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	You weren't insulting his mother, he clearly has NO respect for you or any women for that matter. How can a self respecting "man" allow his mother to feed him like a baby? That is ridiculous. If I were you I would drop his *** like a bad habit, you deserve better.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	These are all signs of thing to come in your future. The suggestion that differences in culture might be obvious should be seriously considered as a  valid point of dissension between you two.<br>  <br>  Try to imagine you, doing for him what his Mommy does for him because that's what he wants from you. In fact, if you look closely at her, she is what he wants you to be, plus the sex.<br>  <br>  It's actually not uncommon for a guy to marry someone similar to his mother (and I doubt that you qualify or would want to), but there are such major differences between how you were raised and how he was raised that I can't say there is much hope for long term stability in this relationship unless you both make concessions and are able to meet half way.<br>  <br>  His mother's opinions of 'white' people is not a healthy attitude and that has and will continue to be an issue. He has internalized that attitude and unless he can or will change (his attitude) then there is little hope for a positive and healthy relationship here.<br>  <br>  You could make every change to yourself possible, and nothing you do will ever be good enough. He sounds to me like an abuser in the making. Thank his Mommy for that.<br>  <br>  You would definitely be better off single.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Here's the thing. Love is not enough. In order for a relationship to work, you have to be compatible. Also quit ignoring red flags just because the sex is great and you loooooooovvvvveeee him.<br>  <br>  Let's look at the red flags, shall we?<br>  1. There is a huge void between us;<br>  2. You're white and he makes frequent negative comments about white people.<br>  3.  He hangs up the phone on you.<br>  4. He says white girls are sluts.<br>  5. He has qualities that are unattractive to you.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can be so proud of yourself and how socially advance you are that you dated a Muslim man. Congratulations for your political correctness.  Yippee for you.<br>  <br>  But you really need to be much more selective in choosing a dating partner compared to a friend.  You should evaluate each dating partner as though they were a potential marriage partner because otherwise you will continue to date a whackadoo and then you're so in looooooovvvve and it makes it more difficult to break up. A friend you see at your convenience. A spouse is with you 24/7 for the rest of your life. Be more choosy in your choice for spouse.<br>  <br>  Fast forward 5 years and you are married.  Imagine your life with him.  OK, besides the great sex part. You can have great sex with anyone so take that out of the equation.  He is from a culture that treats women like servants who are expected to wait on their man on hand and foot...and that's how he treats his mom.  Do  you want that kind of a marriage? You will have to do everything in the home...and without praise, support or thanks. He speaks poorly about white people and you're white.  Would you want to invite that attitude into your own home for an every day kind of an existence?  He wants you to be more modest. It's one thing to not be wearing micro minis or displaying your cleavage. He would expect you to dress as conservatively as his mom.  Is that acceptable to you?<br>  <br>  It's not that hard to get rid of someone.  After you break up with them, you stop answering their calls and e-mails. Just because the phone rings, you don't have to answer it. The two of you are simply not compatible. Just say goodbye.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	End it. TODAY.<br>  I mean it.<br>  <br>  This "relationship" is totally toxic.... and it is a recipe for a disaster.<br>  You do not respect or understand each other, and your backgrounds are different as well. <br>  <br>  Please be smart and understand that some things are just NOT MEANT to be...like you and this man together.|`|uF5Xgtgraa	Why would you want to stay with a Momma's boy who's family bashes your own culture?  Or a relationship where you will be looked upon as a second class citizen by a man?<br>  <br>  'i love him too much' -What?  Do you know what love really means?  Obviously you do not, if you are willing to put up with this BS.  <br>  Stop all contact and get that @$$hole out of your life forever.  Let his Mommy take care of him...|`|M43M4KZxaa	you didn't insult his mother but you are insulting your worth as a woman.if in spite of he being a mommas boy and disrespectful.and to add your differences in culture you still love him?then what more can i say?go ahead and cling to him.|`|oJTxk2cDaa	He is obviously living in a completely different world to you, so tell him that if he doesn't respect you then you no longer want to be friends with him.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	You're not right for each other, you need to break it off and get out.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	He's isn't mad you insulted her, he's mad because you insulted him. Why on earth do you want to be with a man that lets his mother feed him and has no respect for women in general but seems to have an extra large chip on his shoulder about white women in particular. Since you are a white woman, I'm left wondering what is lacking in your life that you feel you deserve a man like him..<br>  <br>  Added:<br>  You don't love him. You are hoping to change him. To show him you are worth it. He won't change. He meant what he said. It's been my experience people don't say things they don't mean in the heat of the moment. They say things they want to say, but don't have the courage to say when they are thinking rationally. When they are angry, they lose their filter and it comes out.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	I'm sorry hun, momma's boys are impossible. I didn't even bother reading this b/c from my experience, there is just no winning with them. You will literally wear yourself out. It is not worth it. Trust me, there are sooooooo many men out there. Why put up with the nonsense from a momma's boy? Let him have his mother and you go find a REAL man.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I'd get rid of him.  First off, he's a Momma's boy and if he's going to put her before you that's a problem.<br>  <br>  Second, he verbally abused her.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I need to tell you a story. My husband and I were watching a Celtics game and they showed this ring with a big letter "C" on it.  My husband was like "The ring has a picture of a giant C on it." to which my immediate response was "Yeah, but who would want to buy a ring with a picture of your Mom on it?"<br>  <br>  Her literally BURST out laughing.  He knew it was a joke, and it was funny.<br>  <br>  By the way, I DO NOT get along with my husband's mother, and it's a problem.  However, he always puts me before her.  If he didn't, I wouldn't have married him.  Just my opinion.|`|lRcQ8sXJaa	First off, noone should ever talk to their mother like that especailly if they are 21.Its is VERY UNATTRACTIVE and makes him look like a pig.Secondly, You werent insulting his mom, you were stating whats right and he shouldnt have reacted like that.I say..hell yeah you should get ride of him|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	I don't know if you can handle the ignorance from this family.  Muslim culture is very different from western thinking, so I will suggest you study or try to understand where he gets this thought of thinking.  Also, I think you can get a better man to treat you right.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	You didn't insult his mother you insulted him and for good reason. He's a verbally abusive Momma's Boy. I can't imagine what it is you see in him.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Run, honey. Run as fast as you can, in any direction that isn't TOWARDS him. And do it NOW.|`|qAR26vRFaa	Get rid of him, he sounds like he has some serious issues.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	tell him if he wants a woman servant as a partner, go find his own kind.|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Dump him and his mother.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	DEFIANTLY....Get rid of that one quick.|`|E638ukebaa	What are doing with this idiot, dump him asap|`|TZpFcx47aa	ODear. Get rid of him like yesterday!!|`|FBRQq5sBaa	How you find this guy lovable is beyond me......<br>  By the way you should dump him|`|34ikhhtMaa	I think he is nasty for talking about American women like that and I would sooo leave him. He is controling you and it"s wrong. And you never disrespected his mom, he did that himself. My advice is to leave him and find a real man.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	K, this is how it goes.. learn from this advice pleeeease, the way a guy treats his mother shows a lot on how he will treat the woman in his life. If he doesnt respect his own mother what makes you think he will treat you any better? He's already disrespecting you. My hun is a mamas boy, he's 39 years old but he takes care of her and respects her and gives that great love and respect for me as well. Yes get out of the relationship, and dont EVER tolerate a guy to disrespect you, EVER.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|72MtoWxRaa	Well I married a mommas boy. Its horrible and it will only get worse., He will never chose you over his mother, he will never take your advice over his mother and he will always do what his mother says, even if it means getting rid of you. Every choice in his life will never be whats best for you and him, but what is best for her or what she thinks is best for him. His life will never include decisions for YOU AND HIM..  The decisions that he makes will always be in the best interest of what mommy thinks is best for him and what will ultimately make him get rid of you. BEcause you have been accepting this, in his eyes, you will never leave him. He knows this and so does mommy. Its disgusting but I have walked in on my mother in law washing my husbands back in the bath. I expressed the inappropriatness of that and I was told that he came from her and long after Im gone, she will be the one there for him. She raised him on this theory, "WOMAN ARE LIKE BUSES, ANOTHER ONE COMES EVERY 20 MINUTES. YOU MISS ONE, THERE ARE ALWAYS 10 MORE THAT COME AFTER IT."  and also "YOU HAVE TO CHEAT ON WOMEN AND HURT THEM BEFORE THEY HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO IT TO YOU BECAUSE WE ARE ALL WHORES AND SHE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT ISNT..." what a mother right?  She also told him that he should leave me because like all the rest, I will leave him too and as always, she will be the only one there in his life.  When he married me, she tried to get him to leave me at the altar telling him that I will hurt him and cheat on him and that if he wants to go she will explain to me that it just wasnt right. When he said no, he wants to marry me, she then came to me and told me that he will never be faithful to me and to save myself hurt, i should just walk away and she will explain to him that i just couldnt do it. Mind you, she is the one who even paid for our wedding, she offered and then tried to not let it happen. My husband has other children with other woman so she is constantly telling them our business just to start fights between all of us. We have a daughter together and the whole time I was pregnant she was feeding into his head how our daughter wasnt his and that when she is born SHE wants a paternity test. But then when she came out she was the spiiting image of my husband so for her to request a paternity test would be obsurd and she knew it. Right now he is living with her. She convinced him that he needs a break because our daughter is 8 months and we have been fighting alot because im tire dall the time and I just want him to help a little with night feedings, etc. She told him that I dont need the help and that he shoudlnt have to help since Im the mother so she convinced him to move in with her for a few months and proceeds to tell everyone that we are seperated which we are not. SHe is even inviting woman over the house trying to hook him up with them knowing that we are not seperated and have no intention on being. It started out small like yours, and through the years it got worse because i accepted it. I cant say anyting bad about her because he will snap on me. He has told me many times, she is number one and always will be regardless that he is married and regardless that he has children, MOMMY is always number one.  I have tons of experience in this so if you want to talk more about htis, you can email me at tracy_112011@yahoo.com    i would definitly love to talk to you...|`|abcef21f35c1b7e1c21c4f95d70f6632aa	Why waist your time here,  yeah yeah you love him  but you can love anyone.  Do you want this forever?  I am telling you people are who they are and nothing will change them.  I can't imagine why someone would waist their time in a relationship like this.   So are you going to continue in a unhealthy relationship because you need someone,  love him all day long but in your heart you have to know that this is not what you want.  Ending a relationship is really hard but sometimes it is the best thing.  It sounds like there are some real nasty habits that have developed and trust me they are harder to break than you would think.  I would move on personally.  I have been married 11 years and the nasty stuff does not get better with time.  If you are not respected now then you won't be respected later.  You can't teach someone to respect you,  this guy is who he is and respect is not in his vocab.  Don't you think you deserve something better, don't you want better.  Here is what you should do before you decide to end it.  Make a list of every name he has called you, every ugly thing he has said, and the times he has disrespected you.  Look over the list and say,  even though I make him mad, even though I say things, even though I can be difficult and unreasonable,  do I want this and is this healthy,  You can't change him or make him see it your way.  That should make your decision easier.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Wtf? What sort of 21-year-old behaves like that? Eugh.<br>  <br>  PS. He swears at you and insults your race? Wow. Imagine the tables turned at you yelled at him like that and called him the N word? How long do you think he'd tolerate you for ? He wouldn't and shouldn't have to, and neither should you.<br>  <br>  You should end it of course, but not before making some anti muslims jokes and hanging up the phone lol, that's what I'd do. <br>  <br>  "Does my bomb look big in this?"|`|Nq4vCxAUaa	Read what you have written.<br>  You SHOULD see that the answer is obvious.<br>  You are not wrong to get rid of him.<br>  Unless you fancy being an enabler to someone with some MAJOR codependency issues, feel no guilt.|`|Yn1XKXMSaa	Im sorry but if i was in your relationship, if i was you. Id leave him and find someone who respected me|`|f1907Oehaa	First of all, you can NEVER love a person until you live with him. DON'T FORGET THIS.<br>  <br>  Secondly, as a muslim, I know muslim families don't like to get involved with non-Muslims entering their families, because a lot of issues arises from this. If you were white and muslim, then it might be different. In Islam, boyfriend/girlfriend relationships are wrong, so he's probably doing this relationship behind their backs. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I think your 'boyfriend' is pakistani? Pakistani mothers are CRAZY about their sons, especially if he is the only son. If I were you, I would forget this relationship, especially when you know this type of relationship is wrong in his religion and his family disapproves of it. Especially when his mother and family doesn't approve of you, how can you ever get married to him?... it will be hell for you. Unless, you become muslim.. learn about Islam, and his culture. Show him through the knowledge of Islam how he should be in his religion; it is not allowed for him to swear and talk bad etccc.|`|fELUJmkvaa	If you want to stay with him, be prepared to be disrespected.  He's already cursing at you, hanging up on you, walking away from you.  He obviously has no respect for women (American women particularly) including his own mother.  This could be a cultural thing.  But unless you demand total respect NOW this will be a losing battle.  Likely he looks at white women as loose/easy and to be treated as such.  Good luck.

gO9tl2uhaa	No you're not picky, you're very normal.<br>  <br>  A LOT of guys are, what I call, wusses: clingy, desperate, not confident and all that crap.<br>  <br>  Honestly, in my opinion, you're on the right track. You have to date A LOT ( I seem to often capitalize A LOT when I answer - it's my thing...I guess..). <br>  <br>  The fact is there aren't many "perfect-for-you" guys around. They usually end up in a relationship really fast. So you need to keep looking, because if you give in for a guy you're not attracted to (physically and romantically) it'll never be true love.<br>  <br>  Trust me, if more girls (and guys) like you did what you do (date a lot), there would be a lot less cheating and we would have a lower divorce rate in North America. <br>  <br>  Keep hunting!|`|xgJbxZgfaa	oh my gosh girl, i have the same problem!!! let me tell ya, NEVER EVER SETTLE!!! don't worry, we'll eventually find someone that we'll connect with in all ways, just be patient =)|`|2KC467tFaa	Don't lower your standards.

The other person could really feel for you and be hurt, and you could be missing out on a great relationship since your already in a not so great one.<br>  <br>  I think you probably just haven't met the right guy yet. If the places you're meeting guys is limited, maybe try branching out and trying someplace new. There are pleanty of options for where people can meet. I know a lot of people who only look for dates online, or only try to meet people at their local bar or club, or through a friend... but why not try them all?

Goodluck & God Bless!|`|aGAdZSNDaa	okaii well i mean it sounds like you both like eachother. and listin i would jus try and work things out. noone says u have to rush into marriage. because yr still young. and so date and see where things go. and i totally agree abut havin sex after marriage. cuz im 18 and still a virgin. good job and good luck.|`|SGa8ruXdaa	racist!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|h4rzhqCuaa	every guy looks for sex when they meet a girl cus if they lookn for a relationship to settle in then they lookn for passion and romatice with a partner but uh i belive go head and ask her for her name and number see if she can have male friends and if she seeing any one but if she dont reject you  then you ok go for round 2 if she do reject respect her you may get luckly. most of the time when someone is rejected by someone they really like and that person dont even  tempt to pay them no mind any more the person that has rejected will start to like that person to. so u may b luckly. be your self and see what will happen man gud luck.....|`|3wIumdJzaa	Well first off, you are only 17 years old, so I don't think your going to be getting married any time soon, I'm pretty sure you have about 15 to 20 years before that. The fact that she's from a different nationality shouldn't matter, if you like her you like her for who she is, she has 2 arms 2 legs, two eye just like you do does she not. Think of all the interesting things you can learn from each other, give it ago, and don't worry about what others have to say, as long as she likes you and you like her just enjoy the process take the next step good luck.|`|olMVfnljaa	Don't worry about marriage yet, you're only 17.

You should find a way to get her to cook them as well. <br>  <br>  domestic violence might also be an option in getting her to cook for you.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	When she gives grandma her dinner take it from her.<br>  The fact that everyone is taking this question seriously is hilarious.|`|GsSRY7quaa	you are an ***. how did you eat before you got married?  get off your lazy butt and do some stuff around the house! clean up something, vacuum the floors/carpet, wash  the dishes....WAKE UP MAN!|`|PWN5rqgxaa	dude when you make your lunch just make double so you can have some for supper|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Troll...you can't be serious.|`|doM7kDUDaa	kick to the face usually does it.|`|xVecKF26aa	WOW- You sound like my husband!

YUkzmz1daa	That's a hard one. Usually if you have cheated once you will do it again, especially if you did it for selfish reason and got away with it like you did. You will end up having that urge to do it again, even though you think you never will. If you truly are sorry for what you did, maybe your husband will forgive you. I think if you don't come clean about it you definitely will do it again. People do make mistakes and if you don't come clean to someone it will eat you up from the inside out. You will start acting strange, then that secret will eventually ruin your marriage anyway.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	And what philosophy tells you that "doing good" removes the intent of your motive?<br>  <br>  The other man may chose to tell and there is nothing that you can do about it so it is very possible that your husband will come to know.  The other man has motive, too.  Perhaps you have met you just desserts.<br>  <br>  You would benefit from counseling for your "selfish reasons" and "adventure".  There is no reason to think once is enough.|`|ygimTNzoaa	I feel it's necessary to tell him what you did. I could not respect myself to look or touch my man again after I cheated on him ONCE let alone repeatedly for months. I'd think, I am not worthy of him unless I get his acceptance and forgiveness. But, I'd not expect it. Feeling bad is not punishment for the wrong you've repeatedly done. Taking full responsibility and confessing it is. Good luck with that.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	The guilt will keep eating you away until you tell him.  He's your husband so I'm sure he knows that you have self esteem issues.  Get on some anti-depressants or something so you don't have to be a tramp.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	You knew you were cheating so your lame A $$ "i've admitted to myself what I've done" is PATHETIC!!! The only way you'd be truly remorseful is if you fessed up to your hubby and paid the consequences of your actions.<br>  <br>  While you are right that what you did does not define you. how you handle it DEFINITELY will define you.  Only a lying, cheating, sniveling whimp would compound their infidelity by ommitting the truth from the one they've betray and that, my dear, goes straight to the heart of your moral character.  If you're not interested in owning up don't waste our time with your half baked attempt at remorse.  We aren't buying it!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	It's good that you know what caused to you feel the need to cheat. That's the first step in putting all of this behind you. <br>  <br>  I will admit that I'am a little like you, I know that I'm not 'ugly' yet I don't think or feel that i'm 'pretty' either. My husband always tells me how gorgeous I'am, but it's just so hard for me to believe that. I don't have much self esteem when it comes to my looks. I'm not shallow and I don't need others gradification to think that I'am, but I do need to really know that my husband finds me attractive. So I understand what you are saying about that.<br>  <br>  The best thing I can say, is think about AIDS. STD's... My sister works in the hospital. She tells me everyday how many people come in there and are tested positive for AIDs, not including all the other STD's, she said that If everyone could see the extremely high number of people who are positive for AIDs, she said NO ONE would have sex with anyone. That's a scary thought, that it's so wide spread like that. <br>  So just remind yourself, if you ever get the urge to cheat again, remember just because he looks 'normal' doesn't mean he's STD and AIDS free. And that little bit of gradification isn't worth your life, or your husbands life.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I went through that phase myself and it can lead to very destructive spiral.  The worse I felt about what I was doing, the more I needed the satisfaction or as you put it ego gratification.  I finally realized that I was destroying everything, myself, my marriage, the other people that I was cheating with.  I sought professional help, and was able to save myself, although the marriage was ruined and eventually dissolved.  I can say that there is a cure and you can do well.  So look for a therapist and hopefully you can save your marriage and your own personal wants and needs.  Good luck.|`|t81MEJ82aa	It's as simple as not doing it again. If you really have this problem then why not seek therapy for yourself to sort everything out. I agree with you though that if you aren't going to do this again just keep it to yourself. Don't tell anyone, not friends, family, a co-worker, etc.|`|B359bLqsaa	I dont think you should admit it to your husband because it will only hurt him and cause too many problems.  Just realize what you did and never make the same mistake again.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Hope you don't give your husband an STD because you were an emotional cripple.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	While in counseling - I learned that when a person has an affair because of neglect in a marriage, he/she will NEVER tell anyone!  They did it for their self, not to hurt their partner. Those who cheat, tell some one, because they really want to get caught. It's more the "thrill of living on the edge"...  <br>  <br>  You just told a forum of strangers.............. wow!|`|2JPRTMIJaa	I'm sorry, but I have no pity for you at all. Just because you can "admit" it now is not worth a thing. You are going to hide it and lie to your husband, so who cares that you admitted it to yourself? What's that worth? NOTHING!<br>  You will cheat again, guarenteed. You got away with it, and you are still making excuses for it by saying things like you were "adored". <br>  Why do women cheat and say they needed the attention, to feel important, etc.? Guys have it rough in marriages too, and statistically women cheat more. <br>  I hope your husband wakes up one day and sees what kind of a person he married and runs as fast as he can, because he deserves better than you.|`|EMKuBql8aa	So basically, you want people to tell you it is ok to not be honest and have open communication with your husband and to continue living the lie because even though there is no more relationship going on, it is still a lie you are living with.<br>  <br>  Sorry, it isn't going to happen from me. You need to come clean or get a divorce, anything else is just kidding yourself, he will find out one day and then he will be really angry by your lack of honesty. <br>  <br>  Just so you know, people like you disgust me.|`|FXCoGD44aa	It's good that what you recognize what you did, the fact that it was wrong, and acknowledge and own your mistake. Whether some people on here agree with me or not, that in itself is commendable.<br>  <br>  I think the next step for you to do is to stop beating yourself up about it. You can't and shouldn't feel like sh*t for the rest of your life - no matter what mistakes you make. You may want to seek counseling for professional advice on how to get over it. A counselor is completely neutral and confidential - he/she would not contact your husband.<br>  <br>  In the future, if you find yourself crossed with another "opportunity" - remind yourself of exactly how you feel right now. Look down at your wedding ring and really THINK good and long before you act.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Well, you told all of us about it, how do you know that your husband can't access your Q&A account here? As for what you plan to do about it, it will eat you up on the inside, carrying that secret around with you like that, especially as more time goes by. Your just gonna have to keep tight control of yourself if you meet another man who adores you, you need to stop seeking those type of men out. Start putting more effort into your marriage instead of sitting around fretting over your past mistake.|`|m84Ml3Opaa	If you really want to put this behind you, you should stop thinking about it. I know easier said than done right! But if  your goal is to leave with this secret and not destroy your marriage you should figure out what it was that this other did for you that you felt your husband wasn't doing that made you risk so much for this fling. Maybe you need to feel adored by your husband. I know men tend to be awesome at times but at times they forget about what it was that made you want to marry them in the first place. They feel like once they've got you all the pampering and such should stop and they shouldn't have to try so hard. Talk to your husband and find ways he can make you feel like then center of attention and just better than any other woman. I struggle with self-esteem issues too, and I have to remind my husband that's why I need so much reassurance from him. Make your marriage work.|`|wia9SXCPaa	I'm not going to tell you what is right, but I will share my experience with you.  I cheated on my husband 5 years ago.  I was like you ashamed and afraid to tell him.  So, I buried the truth.  Somehow he did eventually find out.  He confronted me but I denied it (i was stupid) and he believed me for a while.  But this ate at him and when he had more evidence and was sure he never told me.  Instead he went looking for someone to love him.  He ended up having a 2 1/2 year affair.  He fell in love with her and finally came to me to tell me figuring it would be finished when I kicked him out.  But I didn't and we have one big mess that we are sorting through.  <br>  <br>  What I am saying is if I had the guts to be honest in the first place we probably wouldn't be in the situation we are in now.  I know you are convinced you shouldn't tell him, but if he finds out look at what you are going to have to go through.<br>  <br>  The other thing I learned here is not to give a lot of detail if you have to because it will hurt him and haunt him later on.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking for closure without telling him, I don't know your religion, but I went to confession and shared with God my mistake.  It has helped me heal and move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and God Bless|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It was not a mistake. A mistake is perhaps a one night stand, several months is planned, lied about and sneaky. You clearly have the ability for all 3 of those things and since you got away with it will likely do it again. You should leave your husband so he can get a trustworthy wife.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	it's not fair to not tell him. why is divorce out of the question cause you weren't thinking that when you were being "adored". Your still being selfish. I really don't know what to tell you about how to make yourself feel better, I don't think you will until your honest.|`|X9qrMXQiaa	Tell your husband, if you truly want to know you can't get away with it then let him make the decisions on whether he wants to be with a cheating skank.  You need to deal with the consquences of your actions|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It has happened.  There's not you can do.  You can not reverse the hand of the clock.  Just put it off your mind and move on with your life.|`|NOYxalJ6aa	Yeah, that sucks. How can you ever trust yourself again? I suggest you divorce yourself...|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Stand in a corral full of bulls. That's what you do.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	OK....I won't judge you. <br>  But I do think cheating is a horrible thing, and if your husband has not abused you in any way, it makes your actions even worse...You have done something that is harmful in many ways and in different levels; and that is why you feel so bad now.<br>  <br>   I would seriously suggest you go to counseling or therapy ASAP. I mean it. You cannot undo what you did already; but if you are sorry and you don't want to do this again, you need to seek professional help. <br>  <br>  You did this for some reason....So you need to find out WHY and address the issues immediately. Sounds to me like you need to work on your self-esteem; and also on areas that concern control, risk, commitment and trust.<br>  <br>  Unless you work on finding out what happened and why you did what you did, chances are you may end up doing it again...So stop... and get a trained professional's help today.<br>  <br>  Guilt is a very powerful feeling....but sooner or later it will harm you, so you have to learn to forgive yourself. Ask God to help you and guide you. Good luck.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	Tell your husband. If you do please understand that at that point it is about making him feel better not yourself. It was a selfish and cruel thing. Im glad you have finally admitted to yourself the gravity of what you have done. Maybe not fully, but you are heading in the right direction<br>  <br>  How to avoid it in the future? Dont put yourself in a position where you can be vulnerable to another mans attention. If its at work and you sense things could potentially get out of hand, you need to immediately distance yourself from that person. Be professional and dont get personal. Think of how you would feel if your husband were doing to same thing to you?Not good I imagine. And rightly so.<br>  <br>   Tell him, and give him all the time he needs to heal, maybe a counselor for you and one for the both of you would be a good idea.|`|RgINbeNFaa	Thats the problem isnt it?  youre guilty and you don't want to fall prey again but you won't admit to one you claim to love.  so you most likely will do it again until you get caught, and you will.  there is know "doing something good" to make up for it.  there is only doing whats right.  you werent afraid to do this to your husband so you shouldnt be afraid of him leaving.  in a since you don't really care if it ends anyway|`|VAI6MtPIaa	You need to sit down with a counselor and talk about it. You'll keep it so bottled up until you explode and it won't be pretty. Only you know if you will be able to control yourself in the future. Why don't your husband treat you the way this stranger did? Doesn't he treat you the way you want to be treated? <br>  <br>  Why is divorce out of the question? I can see why you want to keep it from your husband but I don't know if that is a good idea either. Maybe marriage counseling would be suited for both of you so your husband can hold you up on the pedestal sometimes.<br>  <br>  You are being selfish and not looking to how this will effect the marriage.|`|ZEitfScGaa	First off end the affair if you haven't already. You won't be able to forgive yourself if you don't. I know that this is hard. I am dealing with it also. I cannot take the fact that I did what I did, and that I have caused so much pain to the one person that I truly love and care about. It makes me sick to my stomach even thinking about it now. <br>  Just focus your attention to your husband. Work to make your marriage strong, and you stay strong yourself. I know that the guilt and pain that you feel is horrible, but you caused it, so you have to deal with it, and the consequences that may come along with it. It has been a year since my wife found out, and we both still struggle with it on a daily basis. Its hard, but we have stayed together, and in someways we have become stronger. We both still hurt though, my wife hasn't forgiven me, and I don't think that I will be able to forgive myself until she is able to do that. <br>  Just learn from this. Realize how much you love your husband, and this is making you feel. And whenever temptation may arise again think back to this, and realize that its just not worth it.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	So you feel guilt and shame. Step 1 complete. You don't want to do it again. Step 2 complete. You plan to take this secret to the grave. Step 3 complete. You are almost there. What's step 4? Don't do it again. That's all there is to it. There is no point in having guilt and/or shame unless it motivates you to do something positive. So if you are motivated to do the right thing, there will no longer be a need for you to feel guilt or shame over this. Let it go. You cannot change the past. Do not let these feelings burden you anymore. Good luck!|`|cDRXtuJCaa	Your still being selfish for you not admit it to your husband because your afraid what you loose but if you want to make it right tell him the truth he probably knows anyway,let him decide if the marriage worth saving <br>  As for the next time your bored or self esteem issue take up a sport or a hubby that does not involve laying someone just because you can <br>  remember your action hurt other if your hubby gives you another chance you need to really make amends|`|krQiDGCHaa	Do you feel if you tell your husband that he will divorce you?  You say your husband cannot know, but I think honesty is the best way to go with it.  If it were a stupid one night stand hookup, I'd almost agree with keeping it to yourself since it was a one-time f*ck up.  However, since you had an ongoing affair, I really do think you should be honest with your husband and tell him the truth.  He deserves to know.<br>  <br>  I know you must feel horrible, and I won't go on a tirade about how you should feel awful, etc, like I know a lot of people will probably do.  You made a mistake, you're sorry for doing so, and you recognize that it's wrong.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you have to realize the depth of your mistake.  I'm sure you do considering the way you're talking about it.  I still do think being honest with your husband is the best route to go.<br>  <br>  Let him know what you did, why you did it, and how sorry you are for what you did.  I also think some counseling may be a good idea, for your self esteem.  Maybe a therapist can enlighten you on why you had these issues, and how you can avoid having them again.<br>  <br>  Just remember:  If your marriage is truly the most important thing in the world to you, do not throw it out the window over sex with someone else.  Your husband can make you feel good -- LET him make you feel good.  Tell him about your self esteem issues, and I'm sure he'll do his best to make sure you never have a low self worth again. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|p9gOEkSPaa	don't listen to all the negative comments. it'd only make you sink deeper into despair. i think you're a GREAT person for admitting your mistake and for realizing that you did something bad. Next step is to just NEVER DO IT AGAIN. thats all there is to it. thats all you or any one can do. and for all the ppl who gave harsh comments here. DON'T JUDGE A MAN UNTIL YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN HIS SHOES.... we all make mistakes, and the best thing we can do is realize the mistake and make amends. If you stay clean from now on, i think you'll be just fine. but for now, you should address the issue that made you cheat in the first place. why do you like being "liked" so much that it can make you cheat?? join a support group or see a therapist for that. second, make sure that you're clean and have no std's. then finally, focus on your marriage and husband. whats missing there?? what made you wander? is your husband boring or too busy or just not very vocal about his feelings? try to communicate with him as much as possible. talk and talk and talk. therez no way anyone can know what you need unless you tell them. a mother wouldn't know what her kids need if they won't tell her. then how can a husband know what his wife needs. you have to SAY THE WORDS. if you want admiration, TELL HIM. he has no other way of knowing. this is real life honey, not a novel or some romantic chic flick. Finally, i think your husband has a right to know but if you're not comfortable abt telling him or if you know it'd only damage your marriage or hurt him and kids then just stay quiet and be very careful about posting such questions here. my other account got hacked recently and i know the misery i went thru. anyway, take care and good luck!|`|z3FDnKXQaa	the bottom line is do you still really love your husband?  If you do then you can face your mistake admit it was a mistake and try to put it behind you and move forward.  I wouldn't tell your husband but make sure your feelings for your husband are genuine because if your feelings have changed this behavior might manifest itself again.  Time to sit down and reexamine your marriage.  Best of luck!|`|YYAUr8t9aa	I don't care what you do. I hope you get fed to the wolves.

Its admitting that you did it, knowing that it was wrong and being truly sorry it to the point that it will never happen again. God forgives those who are truly sorry. I dont know what religion you are but I would go to chruch and confess to a priest what you did. Seek guidance, explain why you did it to him as you did to us. I wouldnt tell yur husband because he will leave you and I think that you know it. I get in the same boat. I am 27, married with kids. I often need to feel the ego gratification from others especially after kids and being with the same man for so long. It gets rough thats why I cant condone anyone for their decisions. If you want to talk more about this you can email me at tracy_112011@yahoo.com because there are things that I have had experience with that i will not put on blast on public answers so feel free to email me and we can talk more in depth..|`|AA10353286	Hmm. Something tells me this will come up again, either because sometime down the line your husband will cheat on you and you will find out and tell him that you cheated on him. Or, the guilt will eat you up and eventually this will come out. Or, he will start questioning you and you will admit it. I mean, these types of things always come out some sort of way. The energy between you and another person is hard to hid forever because humans are social creatures. We pick up stuff like this.<br>  <br>  In any case, nobody is perfect and you need to do what you think is necessary to remain monogamous in your marriage if that's what you have promised your husband. Personally, I don't believe in life long monogamy(I'm in my 20's too) and I don't moralize the issue, but that's just me. I believe in honesty and full disclosure in a marriage though, and if I were falling into an affair with a man, my husband would absolutely know about it. <br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up about it. You aren't helping anyone. You're not a dirty skank. You're human. Most people will cheat on their spouse and/or get divorced. You're just like the rest of us. Marriage is not a fairy tale. There is nothing "perfect" about any relationship with another human being, ever. If you think it is/was, then someone is doing some really good lying, but somewhere down the line maybe even 40 years-the shyster will hit the fan.<br>  <br>  Again, just be honest. Tell your husband what's going on with you. You owe it to him. Also, get tested for STDs before having sex with him again.  You OWE him that as well.

Anticipation is a great beautifier.<br>  <br>  If you both work,  and rely too much on carry out because neither of you feel like cooking, offer to cook a couple of nights a week, and make something healthy to share.<br>  <br>  If you eat at different times, graze instead of eating regular meals, or go off into your own little corners at meal time, schedule a time when you can both be available for dinner, and sit down at the table together.<br>  <br>  If you notice she seems to have dropped a couple pounds, take her out shopping for a new outfit.  Don't tell her that's why you're doing it, just take her out and show her you think she's beautiful.  If she notices increased interest coinciding with the loss of a couple of pounds, it will motivate her to work harder on it.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of other ways to approach it, but the bottom line is if you go about helping her to lose weight in various sneaky ways like this, not only will she look better, but your relationship will get better too.  Put on your thinking cap, and think up sneaky ways to get you both in better shape, and share more quality time together.|`|nrXCCf76aa	Make her catch the people and WALK them to the jail/prison, Dog.<br>  <br>  She'll be thin in no time:P|`|BjyXKFpRaa	just sit her down and talk to her .|`|6jaovqZtaa	no by all means u have to tell her, if not then your love will probably fade. marriage = honesty do not lie to her just talk to her. tell her that you would like to tell her something that has been on your mind and because you love her you want to let her know that you want her to be around forever if possible and u think that you both should do a lil walking to keep... just let her know she should be your friend as well as ur wife|`|0EUBc2hRaa	You need to just have the talk. It's not about being mean, make it about her health. Be polite but be honest.|`|Pe4wijKkaa	Leave her alone. She probably knows and doesn't need you telling her.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	She knows.  Just ask her if she is eating more due to some emotions that she is afraid to express. Or has her metabolism changed?  Does she want the 2 of you to start taking walks together?  If you have supper after 6 pm then that will add lbs.<br>       Have you told her you love her? This is not a subject about looks....It is about HEALTH and obesity leads to many life-shortening conditions.<br>  Tell her that you want her around for a very long time and the weight will prohibit that dream.  Good Luck|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Make it more of a conversation about health concerns, not about being fat.  Then make a plan to work on thing TOGETHER.
CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sorry to hear about this.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you feel like you do because she has managed to MAKE you BELIEVE you are not a good person....and deep down you know you are. So you feel confused....Who wouldn't if they were in your shoes?<br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest you consider leaving....at least for a couple of months. Be on your own and re-evaluate things. Sometimes we need to get away, to back off, so we can see the entire picture. (When we are in too deep, we tend to just see parts of the problem, not the entire scene.)<br>  <br>  It sounds like she is taking you for granted, and also allowing her kids to act like delinquents. This is not right. So for your own sanity, consider putting some distance between you and all of them.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Sometimes people realize they had something good or valuable when they no longer have it.|`|DKGiGbxGaa	Why do you put up with this. I mean i trying to understand when you say you love her and her children. But she (Tracy) always throw in your face that you need to mine your business and that she is their mother. You need to man up  and put your foot down and tell Tracy she have two grown a-- men. And if they choose to do what they doing that the choose they made, and that not the life not  want for you and your wife  But Tracy  have to made up her mind that she have to  move herself way from them and she need to understand she have a great husband  and she might lose him because she is not right. Also why don't you two try and move away (like across town) do not give the men your new address only you all new number and Tracy still don't see  things your way, tell her baby bye.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Wow im sorry! First off dont feel like a failure, she is the failure and so are her kids. Shes protecting her delinquent children, WHY becuase she feels bad for them. If she really loved them or you she would do the right thing. Get out of this relationship before you waist your whole life.. Same thing practically happened to my father but hes still with her and MISERABLE!|`|fKOnp43Maa	Sounds like she has "all about me" syndrome. I have a husband like that. You are going to either deal with this the rest of your life or you need to let her go so you can be happy.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you: quit doing it. Let her see how it feels to be ignored. You really don't want to be 60 dealing with all this emotional trauma in your life. Get rid of it! I am!!!!|`|t81MEJ82aa	You're a p*ssy, and that's why you have all of these problems. Kick all of those freeloaders out of your house and dote on a woman worth your time. If your situation is truly this bad, then it doesn't seem like any amount of talking or reasoning with them would make a difference. Stop wasting your life and man up.
IwqTI7Rfaa	These problems of your friends are not your problem, though it shows you are a good friend to worry.  I would give 30 days notice if possible-it would be the proper thing to do so they can locate some more roommates.  They may still be mad but try and ease the tension by having a little party at your new home with refreshments or whatever (dinner,?) sports on PPV if you like it, and try to have a good time.  Tell them they don't have to bring ANYTHING cause they are probably strapped for cash.|`|W8hvEmFlaa	Say this, "Friends, I'm moving out!" then get your stuff and leave.|`|ZKw46efXaa	i dont spose your boyfriend could move in with you there? it would save them money too as they would be getting more rent!!|`|RDQittNDaa	Wait until your lease is up and then move out...don't bail halfway through, that's bush league.|`|HGK3Fb5aaa	why not help them find new roommates!  Give it enough time that there is no lapse in rent money.  and then move when it's appropriate.  also you can have you BF move in with you untill it's time for the move you might find that it's the better option.  If you go move into a one bedroom you will pay more and you won't have all the same things that you get in a house.  :) good luck|`|gIqRs5buaa	The best advice i can give is to be honest with your friend, you cant stay there just because you feel bad. To soften the blow you could suggest helping with finding someone to rent the room, if you find someone then there wont be any money problems and your friend can stay. You could even increase the rent slightly, try advertising online. Hope this helps.|`|f46d7715219180bc009af5394dfa63e8aa	just tell her as soon as possible ,the sooner the better ,let her know you know this may not be what she want to hear but if you can help in looking for another tenant will help ,seems like its no real easy way ,it may mess up your friend ship but the sooner the better.good luck|`|fibLXDXuaa	Just my brother is in the same problem because one of his room mates is well this is about you! so just say im moving out and tell them why and when and it has nothing to do with you unless it does then just dont metion it because its best not to lie...|`|nMhbzKuJaa	I noticed that your other friend moved out and it doesn't seem like they've been replaced...I'm sure that didn't help at all. Make sure you give sufficient notice, and if possible, help find a replacement.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Obviously it wasn't going to last forever. Everyone moves. I would just tell them so that they can try to find another room mate.|`|oTmylEGUaa	Three words.  I'm moving out.|`|5rRgcedhaa	how about ..."im moving out"|`|zeTGmB3faa	Since all of you shared the rent, it would only be right to give them a two months notice so they can find another roommate or two to fill the void. It is your problem because you all got in it together and friends don't leave other friends in bad situations when it can be prevented.|`|653j6x9maa	I think you should find a roomate to take your place first, then tell them
VAI6MtPIaa	You need to go to the doctor and explain this to them. Take a pregnancy test because that's important. If you are pregnant.. DEAL WITH IT. Don't kill the innocent child that YOU and your husband brought into this world. The child didn't ask for it... You should have used protection to ENSURE that you wouldn't get pregnant. Shame on both of you. <br>  <br>  If you don't want it.. Give it up for adoption. <br>  <br>  I don't know what is up with all of the food you are eating.. but did you ever think that you are stressing out about a lot so you are gaining weight.. and eating yourself to an early grave?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You had unprotected sex.  You havent' had your period in nearly three months.  You feel pukey and you're eating all the time.  <br>  <br>  And you sent away for a pregnancy test online?  Good grief.  What's wrong with going to the drugstore and buying a pregnancy test?  It's not like you need to confirm it - I can almost guarantee you are.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	You keep eating like that you will turn into a blimp.|`|UgcPxd4maa	you ordered it offline? Isn't there a CVS, Rite-aid, or Walgreen's around you? I mean....you sound like you shouldn't be having another child, Especially since he said he would make you get an abortion??He sounds like such a charmer!! A guy I defiantly would wanna be with!!|`|YdjU4KqBaa	so what's your question ?|`|cDRXtuJCaa	It not your husband choice if you have an abortion,nor can he assume it be a boy.<br>  You need to decide what you want to do yourself personally,if you wan t this child i not let a man make me get rid of it and  i hate abortion and believe it an act of murder,If you do not want this child have it adopted<br>  but it sound like you are pregnant and you like to have the baby if your scared of your husband there something seriously wrong with your marriage <br>  anyway i wish you well|`|TWCQCSfRaa	Wow--ok so what's your question?  Why are you worried your husbnd will be mad at you?  He had a part in this whole thing too.  If you want the baby you need to talk to your husband.  If you haven't had a period since December 9th-there is a pretty good chance you are pregnant.  You need to get to a dr asap.  Taking prenatal vitamins is not enough.  You have to think of the child too...not just what your husband is going to think.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Honeslty that eating for 2 thing, is BS. Yah you get hungry more often, but you dont really eat more, you still get full the same as before.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	You need an education, not an another child lol.|`|Z2xETWhbaa	Sounds like you may be pregnant but the only way to know is to go to the store or the doctor and get tested.  Also about the abortion thing I am COMPLETELY against it.  How dare your husband even suggest that you have an abortion.  ITs not the babies fault that it has completely and totally irresponsible parents.  IF you don't want the baby then give it up for adoption.  Sounds like you already have 2 kids and neither one of you seems to be the brightest crayon in the box I would strongly advise that you get fixed and if pregnant give this baby up for adoption. The fact of the matter is that if this ruins you marriage it was not a very good marriage to begin with.  You BOTH acted irresponsibly and knew that you had the possibility of getting pregnant and still proceded to have sex.  Sometimes common sense needs to come first.  I feel sorry for this baby if you are indeed pregnant and decide to keep it.  You both don't sound like you are mature or grown up enough to have any kids at all.  Sorry to be so brutally honest but come on now.|`|m84Ml3Opaa	Well, I can't say what you and your husband should do if  you are pregnant, but you didn't get that way by yourself. If you think you are I hope you have stopped taking the birth control pills, because I've heard they will have neg. side effects on the baby. You should find out if you are and have a long talk with your husband about what this means for you two and what you're going to do. He doesn't have the only say so,this is a marriage not a dictatorship. I think he would be happy about another baby, if not , promise to get your tubes tied after this one.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	1)  Did your English teacher leave off explaining the use of periods (you know the . . . . . . ).  I don't expect perfection but damn my eyes are bleeding.<br>  <br>  2) Why did you "order" pregnancy tests on-line when you could have drove / walked five minutes away to any food / drug store and got a test?  Hell, by the time you finished typing all of the above you could have picked up the test, read the instructions and had results.<br>  <br>  3) Pregnant or not, eating like that is not healthy or ok. It's kind of retarded to be taking prenatal vitamins and than turn around and eat that crap you just shoveled into your mouth. <br>  <br>  4)  You and your husband both need to sit down and determine if you really want additional children & can afford them (also taking into consideration of college funds, retirement, owning a home etc.).  The days of being an illiterate peasant popping out 10 kids to work the farm are done and gone.  Welcome to the modern world..try using a bit of logic / foresight.
5bb9fc43e31877bc5eeb2ce0484be92baa	You feel betrayed because he's watching porn? I'm watching porn right now. I have porn in my bathroom, and on my iPhone. If i'm not watching it i'm thinking about naked women when i'm in the grocery store. We like it. It's fun. Stop controlling him. No wonder he wont pork ya.|`|8txWayVnaa	Seriously?  How disabled IS he?  Is he a paraplegic?  Does his tongue work?  His hands obviously work, as he can operate a remote control.  <br>  <br>  I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but if ever there was a good reason for an "open marriage", this is it.|`|a984cQjKaa	your spelling isn't reasonable behavior.  <br>  but if you're feeling so hurt and betrayed, drag him to marriage counseling.  then if it doesn't help, let his porn take care of him.|`|MI8WTnL4aa	I can understand you feeling upset if the two of you haven't got a physical relationship. However, he may have trouble performing due to his disability but it doesn't mean he doesn't have no sex drive at all. Men watch porn. You shouldn't take it personally. It's not cheating. There aren't many men you'll find that don't watch it. He shouldnt be flaunting it in your face though. I am fully aware that my partner watches it but he doesn't infront of me unless we are watching it together. It doesn't bother me knowing he is though. <br>  <br>  Just because he cant have full on sex with you doesn't mean you cant enjoy foreplay together.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Resolution: Give him something to look at. Do a dance for him. Get dressed in pretty lingerie for him. Do a strip dance for him. There are many, many ways for you to give him the entertainment he is looking for. He won't need to watch it on TV.<br>  He's capable of using a remote so his fingers work just fine. Use your imagination and give him some sexual attention. Though I am NOT saying him watching porn is your fault. I'm just saying, if he has something to watch in person, the TV won't be so entertaining.|`|RmVSz5j2aa	i had an ex addicted to porn and i wound up calling off the wedding a month before. he is still losing girlfriends over it. it is cheating and it is betrayal. im sure you are going to get allot of answers on here saying to watch it with him, but don't listen to them. you should never belittle yourself to that nasty behavior. it is a form of cheating. i caught my husband watching it and i let him know i look at it as cheating. it really takes away from your self respect. let him know that. if he still doesn't stop, he will never. it is a nasty addiction to men. and very degrading to women. but if you find something that works, please, let me know.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Him watching porn and him actually being able to perform are two separate issues...I think you need to find out what the two of you can work out in the sex area.  See what he can reasonably do...if he is disabled and can't perform there is no reason he can't "help you out" from time-to-time...<br>  <br>  If you keep waking up to that - take the TV out of your bedroom...problem solved.|`|D33VRTz8aa	Has the doctors said that he is unable to? Tell him how you feel if he is doing such things.<br>  <br>  But please don't be too harsh talk it through only as you will have to understand his point of view too.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	no. its not. for me it would hurt. if you both watch it together then i there shouldn't be a problem. tell him it hurts you. if he understands what u mean then he may stop. if he doesn't then threaten to walk out|`|6llFo77Waa	yes its reasonable behaviour, it is possible to to use porn to compliment your sex life
46xuKWyEaa	Hey this same situation happened to me a year ago, just reverse the sexes.  It sucks...I honestly fell into a deep depression until I finally realized that she's just another girl.  Well he's just another guy, I know how hard it is to go from "all systems go" to nothing just like that, but like I said, it's better for you to realize now that he's just 1 in at least 3 billion guys in the world and he just so happens to be taken.  Does that mean he will be forever? No, but for now he is so try to distance yourself from him mentally before you do what I did and get really depressed.  As for the flirting thing...I'm probably not the best for that advice lol, but just be yourself and don't be afraid to initiate the conversation, guys like it sometimes when the girl comes up to them it's a nice change of pace.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there, and don't let this one dude get you down.|`|mTyv01xMaa	dont be a flirt . its cheep and tacky. i'm a guy and if a girl is just flirting then it seems like she's easy. instead just try being your self and ask them out. it shouldnt always be the males responsibility to ask a girl out.|`|017d07861c62012cf7f58036a5b5bfb0aa	Unrequited love is the worst, man. Crushing you may have been an understatement. sometimes its more like an obliteration! But don't worry. one thing ive learned is that there are plenty of fish in the sea. its good that you said that you wouldnt want to try to get a guy that's already taken. cuz that would be pretty messed up. but dont be a flirt either. just be yourself and people will be drawn to you for you being yourself and not because you flirted with them. be cool with them, make friends with them, then, not only will it be a little bit easier to get closer to them, whatever relationship comes from it will be alot more solid!!|`|kjJGSSOnaa	Well maybe he noticed that you were flirting with him and told your other guy friend to tell you he was dating someone else. He could have had a girlfriend since day one and you just didn't know it. Couldn't he? Or maybe he feels like your stalking him and is weird-ed out. Just lay low and maybe things will change.
9u5A8uriaa	your insecure. Its not a bad thing lots of people get it when they like someone as much as you do this girl. When your in a long conversation just be casual and look at her eyes, its easier when your in a convosation and feel comfortable. goodluck. xxx|`|ekS19dWYaa	Sometimes people feel that others can see into their souls through their eyes. Some natives refuse to have their pictures taken because the camera can see into their eyes and capture their soul. It's probably due to insecurities or something in your past that you wish to conceal from her. If you don't have alot of self confidence it could be that you know you can see her, and she can see you, and maybe that subconsciously bothers you.|`|G82qybLQaa	Well fristly Do you love her? and ur a good friend of her right? So u would know her likes and dislikes right? Do every thing she likes but be ur self, do it in ur style, its not wrong to love ur friends but the thing that is wrong is to know the other person also has same feelings, as frnds u guys go out and hang out and have fun, in all these times did you never so an inch of her liking you? Well try knowing if she also has same feelings and if not express ur self, it is better to say it out rather than put those feelings with in ur self and later feel,"If only i could tell her may be she would have like me"|`|l9bNCR6maa	coz you get emmabaressd
zT3vqKlcaa	Eek these types of situations can be hard but also resolved. First of all talk to both ur friends together at break or lunch and tell them how u feel in the middle maybe say to them "Whats the point in arguin?" and jus say its in the past no one is right no one is wrong lets jus be mates and get them to talk.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  good luck<br>  xxx

I would love to get that from a gf I had. But think of this first, does he like little gifts like that. Because some people don't, personally I love gifts from the heart more.|`|O1HylylMaa	awwwy thats awesome|`|l2iqJbZKaa	Awww that's really cute i like it i think he will like it!|`|mTyv01xMaa	if he is a real man his eyes will start to water and he will love it!!!!|`|R46f2nn9aa	I think it's really cute!<br>  If you wanted to get fancier you could use Windows Movie Maker and add more pics and sounds.<br>  Although I think he's going to love it the way it is.
y54U1JL6aa	This could be a really fun thing to do a couple weeks before the wedding to cool the bride down with some time to relax and have fun with her girlfriends!  I think a light meal is an awesome idea and you could have it somewhere intimate, small and cute but not too pricey.  Or you could plan to have it at someones home and do take-out or something from a nice little deli or have it in the evening and have cocktails and heavy (but good) finger foods!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and I love this idea.  I'm sure she'll enjoy it, whatever you do!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	if the wedding is next month, it's too late for  you to plan this.  you should have sent invitations out last month, and had the party about  now.  for lingerie, don't have it in a public place, have it at someone's house.  but it's too late for you to get catering and clear everyone's schedules so they can come.  why don't  you just have a lingerie bachelorette party?  the bachelorette is supposed to be more risque anyway.|`|0Id85yiYaa	my party didn't have decorations or games. we drank coctails, had a light meal (buffet style) and opened gifts.
kX14PGRcaa	ok this is gona be a long one but please read it ...<br>  <br>  Speaking from experience .. distance yourself from that situation altogether!! It might be hard but down the line you will see it was for the best.  I had a best friend who was a guy, we were so close that people actually thought we were bf/gf .. and it didn't help that I was in the middle of trying to break up with my bf of 2 1/2 yrs at the time lol.  There was one night where we actually kissed but it had nothing to do with any attraction either of us had, cus on my end at least, i was not attracted to him as more than a friend not that he wasnt good looking cus he was just to me he was a friend .. but there was this girl that was following him around the bar all night and wouldnt leave him alone so he said do me a favor and kiss me in front of her, i did it .. felt completely awkward lol.. fast forward 6 months or so I introduced him to a good friend of mine, Veronica.  They hit it off and became a couple within a month, I ended up starting to like some other guy (who 3 yrs later is still my bf) .. and one night we were all at this bar and I was drunk and someone stole my pocket book and I started to get really mad so the bouncer told Veronica to take me to the bathroom and we were in the bathroom and she said I am so happy that you introduced me to Matt blah blah blah he makes me so happy I said aww thats good I am happy to hear, It's nice that someone finally sees me and him as just friends, and that joke of a kiss we faked.  She said it didn't bother her that me and him kissed at all.  It shouldnt have, it was basically a favor for my best friend and besides she wasnt even a figment of his imagination back then.  Thennn it all started.  the phone cals from Matt became less and less, he started making excuses why he couldnt hang out or come over for dinner and on Veronica's end as well.  One night i bumped into matt, after him avoiding my calls for 3 months .. and he basically attacked me and said YOU ARE THE REASON WHY WE ARE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE, WHY I AM DISTANT .. WHY WOULD YOU TELL VERONICA WE HOOKED UP.  She did take it the wrong way .. and apparently he never told her the kiss meant nothing .. she called me up and told me to stay away from her bf .. stop calling him and forget she exists while i am at it.  ...  so i did just that, i left it alone and distanced myself from him .. they broke up a year later,  he came back into my life and apologized but at that point I had already seen the kinda guy he was in a relationship and I wasn't going to let myself get close to him again and have him meet some other girl and end our friendship again.  so i kept him as an acquaintance .. the point im making is.  you will be much happier, and drama free if you just let it go now.  I promise you that by staying friends with them you are asking for trouble .. and little by little they will cut you out of their life.  Avoid it and move along.  I hope this helps in some way or another|`|QhRO0kcMaa	Relax.<br>  <br>  From personal experience,    you're friend will come back to you if you stay in good terms with her. She'll realize her mistakes and apologize.<br>  When I was in my sophomore year, i've really gotten into this girl and barely spent time with my friends. And all I did when i was with them was talk about her. Can you imagine how annoying it must have been for them? Anyway, they were cool with it. And although they were not her best friends, i've asked them to keep a distance from her.<br>  <br>  Now, i realize that i was a fool. I should have spent those time with friends... anyway, just accept that you're friend is having a lot of fun with this boy and as a friend, you should be happy for her. And it's never good to be best friends with a guy. And he should know better to be close with you while dating someone.|`|xjv02joXaa	Relationships have a way of changing people. When you put two different people together it's bound to happen. Sometimes it's a positive change and sometimes it's negative. The best thing to do in this situation is simple. You need to talk to her. Find a time when you and her can be alone, and tell her how you feel. She may not respond well to you, she might even reject you but she needs to know that people are noticing her and still care about her. Keep being her friend. Show her kindness and be understanding while she is going through this time. Keep being honest and straightforward. Eventually people come around. Chances are she knows she's changing and deep down inside she probably doesn't like it. Just talk to her, and don't give up on her. When she comes around she'll be grateful that you were a faithful and good friend.|`|fELUJmkvaa	I say back off from her for a while.  She's treating you disrespectfully.  If she's a true friend she will notice the space and ask what's up.  Then be honest with her.  Maybe she's insecure about your friendship with her boyfriend.  Sneaking out and smoking..sounds like she's trying to change for some reason.  Is she changing into someone who you no longer want to be friends with?  Ask yourself what you deserve then don't settle for less.  Good luck.|`|YrrFIoEiaa	Sent some flowers If you whating loving give some loveing that her out to a nice dinner

oB1TH9Auaa	First of all - YOU ARE NOT SAFE LIVING WITH YOUR UNCLE!  Get out of there.  <br>  <br>  Second - Contact the Health and Human Services Department (or whatever it is called) of the state that you live in, you can get housing assistance, as well as medical insurance, etc.  Your therapist should know the number.  Check on subsidized housing in your area.<br>  <br>  Third - don't go to a homeless shelter, find a shelter for abused women - your uncle is abusing you - you can stay at that type of shelter.<br>  <br>  Fourth - Don't move back in with your boyfriend - until you both are ready for it.<br>  <br>  If you need additional help, you can always go to Victim's Rights office - check your local courthouse.
GsrLh50laa	If both you and your spouse can agree to the terms of the divorce than you can handle all the paperwork easily yourself without a lawyer. Then all you will need to pay is a the filing fee. You can get everything you need to file for divorce on your own without a lawyer at - <a href="http://www.legalformsbank.biz/uncontesteddivorceforms.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.legalformsbank.biz/unconteste...</a> - and you can get more information about the process there.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Depends on the attorney and how much you are going to fight it.  My attorney charges $430 for an uncontested divorce, and that is his fee along with the filing fee.  When I got divorced 9 years ago, it cost me $1500...that was custody/visitation/support cuz the ex wanted to fight it a bit until his lawyer told him to give up on getting custody.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	See a mediator first.Settle all your issues there, then see the lawyer.The longer in court , the more money it costs.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It can cost as little as $50 or as much as $15,000. It really depends on how nice and agreeable you guys are with each other. If you can hash out a child support/custody agreement with each other without lawyers, then all you have to pay is filing fees, but a lawyer will charge an arm and leg, especially if their is a custody battle. We can not tell you how much you will get for child support because we have no clue how much he makes, every situation is different. I wish you luck, hunt around for a lawyer comparing costs, ask them if they are willing to "price match or go lower" with their competitors, you will be surprised, everybody is in need of money these days even lawyers.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I don't know.  I remember when my parents got divorced when I was 13 11 years ago, I overheard her telling someone that she had to give her lawyer a $2,000 retainer.<br>  <br>  That was just the retainer, too.  She had to pay additional funds on top of that.<br>  <br>  It's expensive if you need to fight everything out in court.  If you can agree with your spouse on how to divide everything up, you don't need a lawyer.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who had a child and they got divorced for only court fees -- $150.  They had no lawyers, and they divided everything up without argument, and already agreed on the custody and everything so there was nothing to fight about.<br>  <br>  Try working out your problems instead of fighting and you won't need a lawyer.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Depends on the lawyer, if the divorce is contested, etc.<br>  <br>  My divorce, with an emergency custody order filed, a consent order drawn for a custody agreement (we didn't go to court), with MY lawyer filing the divorce, cost me 1100$. My ex-husband's lawyer did a custody paper that was ALL wrong (which is why mine ended up doing it), he forgot to contest the divorce, etc... and it cost him 2000$... So as you can see, it really depends on the lawyer...|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	It depends on A LOT of things. If the divorce is contested you will need a lawyer, if its agreed upon/uncontested you can do it yourself (saves a LOT of money)<br>  Also, it depends on your state.

The below website would help.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

It was like reading something that described exactly what I'm feeling and struggling with everyday. The only advice that I can give is what I continue to do each day. Unfortunately it is hard to forget the past,but it is also so easy to become consumed by it. I always try to look at each day as a new beginning, a step closer to who I used to be, a step closer to God. Every little step counts no matter how small and insignificant it may seem. Faith is a powerful thing and I believe that sometimes God sends people into our lives to help us grow.

mydVjC4xaa	When you told him you liked him he probably took it lightly because guys can be pretty dense. He probably thought like "oh she likes me as a friend/person kool" she he said he likes you too, but not in the sense for a relationship. So now he's got this other girl.<br>  1. Don't hang out with them, especially if it hurts you<br>  2. Stay away from him so you don't interfere and you dont get hurt even more. I know you like him but it's wrong for you to break up what he already has.<br>  Think about it, if he wanted to be with you he would not be with that girl.<br>  3. Talk to somebody else. Or just start hanging out with other friends. it is better to be happy with other friends than to be sad with one friend.<br>  Reinvent yourself if you must. I know how it is. I felt betrayed when that happened to me. What I did: I ignored him for a year. Even though he still wanted to hang with me I know how much he got attached to my best friend so I continued to ignor him. I wasn't the same anymore for him or my best friend. Years later my best friend was digging deep into me trying to find out why I changed and what caused it. I had always been lying to myself about it. When it finally came out that Justin was the cause of it all my best friend said she was sorry and we cried together. Sucks when a boy comes in between you and your friend but sucks even more when your friend gets in between you 'n your boy. I'm not say'n dat chick he's wit is ur friend, itz just an example.

Wj212FWXaa	you can nail his *** to the wall.  wherever his is stationed, call them up and ask for JAG (they are the army lawyers). tell them EXACTLY whats up as far as you receiving no BAH, him taking all your money, and especially that he is still married and got that girl pregnant.  also, call his commanders up and tell them the situation and that you ARE pressing charges.  DO NOT let them try to calm you down or talk you out of it.  your boy can get a dishonorable discharge and maybe even some jail time, along with his little girlfriend.  adultery is a HUGE no-no in the military, and if the scorned wife is pissed enough, you can bury him.  in the mean time, their cushy little situation will be completely ruined bc they will have to be moved to different units bc it compromises the chain of command if they are in the same unit right now. also, depending on what state you are in, you can toss him in jail right now!  my fiance incidentally is an army recruiter, and 2 months ago another recruiter got caught red-handed by his wife cheating.  she called the police and had him tossed in jail bc adultery is still a crime in many states (we live in Mass).  but at the very least you need to call his commanders and JAG at his base and make a HUGE deal about it so they will be forced not to overlook it.  and yes, unless she can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she had NO idea your hubby was married, she will burn with him.  adultery situations like that in the army are guilty until proven innocent in her case.  and since there is a pregnancy involved, you dont even need to have someone physically watch them have sex to prove he cheated.  so just remember, go apesh*t to his commanders and press the fact that he stole all your money and you never received a dime from the army.<br>  <br>  for more info check out AR 600-20 and scroll down to section 4, it has all sorts of good stuff that you can throw at his commanders as a reference<br>  <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.usapa.army.mil/pdffiles/r600%5F20.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://usmilitary.about.com/gi/dynamic/o...</a>|`|aDIPIu7xaa	This is so F**ked up, I don't even know where to begin!|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Go to his chain of command.

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I think your fiance should escort his mom down the aisle to whatever song you've already picked out for your processional.  He'd be walking down with his mom during the same time that everyone else in your wedding party gets to walk, so he wouldn't get a different song or anything.  The only one who gets the different song is YOU, the bride!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I agree with fizzy, you don't want a bunch of different songs switching around during the processional. But do what you want :)|`|884v4VhGaa	It's generally a good idea to have only one song for the processional. If you want to have different music for everyone, do it at the reception, I've seen a lot of people have formal entrances for the wedding party. <br>  <br>  At the wedding you want the wedding party, parents, and you to walk in smoothly. Do you really want to have to wait during the processional for song switches?<br>  <br>  And don't worry that it's odd - a lot of people walk in with their parents instead of each other. Most of the weddings I've been to have done it that way.|`|T28K68Hoaa	Okay...i used to be a events assistant for weddings and i have only seen the groom walk his mother down the aisle once,and that was bc she was a single mom who raised him (very close family). Other wise she was escorted by his father or not at all. Now if you are okay with him walking her down the aisle then rock on. As for the song well keep in mind that walk is about 20 seconds. The song should go with the rest of precession.Well, it all depends on ur taste. IF i was going to have my fiance walk his mother down the aisle, it would be a song that they shared a memory of his childhood. <br>   I was a brides maid in a wedding 2 years ago and my best friends mother in law insisted on being walked down the aisle by not only the groom but her other 3 sons who where also grooms men. Needless to say she wanted the attention and was kind of was steeling her thunder by having all 4; 6 foot something guys walk her down the aisle. Then have them all comeback to walk the brides maids down the aisle. It was really silly see thing all walk back to get us and it took up time.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if he isn't a signer on your account, or forged a check, he is guilty of fraud and should be prosecuted. get out of the lease, and get rid of the man. if u are the sole signer on this new place, u will be the one responsible if the landlord wants to take someone to court. and if u don't want sued u would need to honor your lease and get a roommate. u could throw yourself on the mercy of the landlord, and hope that they might understand, but today ones credit report is important, because in some jobs they check your credit and if its bad, u won't be hired.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Charge the boyfriend. I think it's a fantasy to believe the owner will let you out of the lease. That's according to the manager of my apartment. Call the police and ask how to legally put him out. There should be a way since he just committed a crime against you.|`|a984cQjKaa	do you have proof that you've been the one paying the bills?  if so, kick him out and find a roommate.  then your honor will be satisfied. reporting his theft to the police and to the bank would help your case, and you'd be able to get your money back as the bank would know that it's fraud.|`|X6C6kZKKaa	just go and forget about the lease and him. don't be a slave to a lease or him. you deserve better. move on.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Write a letter to the landlord explaining the situation.  Press criminal charges for forgery against your boyfriend.  Go to court and prosecute this and ask for restitution to be paid.  You can also sue him civilly over the lease.<br>  <br>  I think that rather than be a party to this type of lawsuit after such a short time into the lease, the landllord will work with you on moving out and not suing you and the sooner you do this, the better.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Go talk to the your landlord and ask them how to get out of it. Tell them your situation. You will have to give a notice and they will keep your deposit, plus you might have to pay a little some thing. My husband and I broke a lease once to move some where else and we have to give a 30 day notice I think, pay that months rent, and pay 250 dollars to break the lease..and they kept the deposit. There IS a way out. Also, you should REALLY take him to court for that forged check. I definitely would. If he stole that much money you need to get it back. And you are VERY right to leave him. Never take care of a man financially.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Kick him out and get a nice roommate!!|`|PWN5rqgxaa	1st lose the loser boyfriend before he makes more trouble for you like making a baby he wont take care of or something<br>  <br>  2nd if you like the place youre renting and want to stay (without the loser boyfriend), talk to the landlord about your situation and ask if you can work something out... with the loser boyfriend out of the picture you should be able to make up the back rent fairly quickly<br>  <br>  3rd if you dont want to stay there, explain to the landlord that youre moving out... give 30 days notice and all that will happen is you lose your security deposit... <br>  <br>  sucks but the same thing happened to me... had a new girlfriend and a nice place and then she went psycho b*tch on me and i had to move

17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	She sounds very slef-absorbed and selfish. The best way is to confront her about it in front of others. The next time she says something, then changes her story, ask her in front of people present why she lied. <br>  <br>  Tell her that she changes her story regularly and it seems pointless. I wonder what answer she will give to that confrontation. <br>  <br>  I have a feeling that she keeps doing this because nobody is confronting her or telling her how silly she looks. She is taking advantage of the situation because she knows you or other people won't stand up to her. Well, I think it's time you did. As you say, it's hurtful to people. Tell her that. <br>  <br>  The only way she's going to change is if she is told that her behaviour is unacceptable. Friendship is based on trust and honesty. So, be nice about it, but tell her the way she acts is not acceptable. Good luck. I hope she realises.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	You have two choices:<br>  1. Confront her directly and firmly that her lying is going to destroy your friendship with her. This only MIGHT work. She may be a pathological liar, who is simply incapable of telling the truth.<br>  2. Dump her as a friend without bothering to try and reform her. That's what I'd do.<br>  Good luck, friend.|`|Md2bTRAnaa	ohh that reminds me of this burden i used to hang out with. she would always talk aboput how bad her life is and she would act like shes the only one in the world that has problems. <br>  <br>  To make a long story short, we dont hang out with her anymore|`|jiqcLFdvaa	Ask her why you always changing what you say and lying? And tell her to stop showing off...then when she does, be all like see i told you you're doing it again.|`|HIav9sVuaa	maybe just have a word with her nothing nasty but just explain to her how your feeling! if she wont stop just ignore her|`|fzZmA68Qaa	STOP F*****G SHOWING OFF, thats the best way. maybe add some violence. enjoy the slaughterfest. ;)|`|JJARLh3zaa	how old is she? maybe she'll grow out of it in a few years|`|HlnDCXIdaa	i have the same problem, my friend is just like that, she always has to be in the spotlight, and everything is like a competition with her, ESPECIALLY with boys, she'll always talk about some boy that likes her, like if i bring up a boy that likes me she'll bring up 2 boys that like her, and then we'll get into a small subtle arguement about it. She gets VERY jelaous when a guy likes me, like she gets upset over it or whenever im in the spotlight its bugs her.  shes never happy for me shes not a good friend sometimes. It is very hurtful your right and its ridiculous. My best advice to u is to talk about it with her, confront her, ask her why does everything have to be a competition, tell her to grow up and stop playing those stupid little games shes playing. Everything is not about her and she needs to realize that.|`|NAwWqDMAaa	well first of all how old are you all ? if your younger than 15 then its just a childish phase she going through and she will grow out of it when she learns to grow up so you need to just stand by and do nothing just wait till she realises how shes acting.. if your all older than 15 then just talk to her about how you feel she is acting and how it sometimes gets you down! if shes a true friend she will listen to what you have got to say and understand and do something about it , if she isnt a true friends that she isnt worth being your friend. good luck x x|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	She's just self absorbed. Why would you wanna be friends with someone you can't share problems with (cos she'll direct the problem to her problem, which is, y'know, 100x bigger than yours). If this is a phase that she's going through, let her be done with it first before you start being friends again. Having friends shouldn't be so frustrating.
fzZmA68Qaa	HAPPY BIRTHDAY, i hope you don't die|`|ALQuQaLGaa	You could say Happy Birthday in different languages, for example, feliz cumplea?os (Spanish), buon anniversario (Italian), joyeux anniversaire (French).|`|ifC1aFHxaa	You are now half-way to fifty.|`|13x9Tnpxaa	"Happy birthday.

You can use it|`|jiqcLFdvaa	I honestly dont know any...but you could write her a little thing like <br>  Hii<br>  Happy Birthday!<br>  (Name) you are many things (describe your friend), and I hope you stay, don't turn all bitter in your old age of 25! <br>  <br>  Something like that...or you could write a meaningful message.

My absolute best friend lied to me all the time and i told her the same thing she begged for me to be friends with her again but now i dont talk to her anymore cuz she told everyone in my old school a bunch of bull lies so hope yours is more true to you than mine was.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	You have two choices:<br>  1. Confront her directly, firmly and as a group, that her lying is going to destroy your friendships with her. Have clear proof that she lied and you all need to be in agreement to make this work. This only MIGHT work. She may be a pathological liar, who is simply incapable of telling the truth.<br>  2. Dump her as a friend without bothering to try and reform her. That's what I'd do.<br>  Good luck, friend.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	Yes you can do a lie detector test. Or drop her as a friend. Why waste your time, energy and focus on people like that. They are good for nothing.|`|doHNEvf8aa	i have a friend like that. we don't really know what to do about her either. just start ignoring her, thats what we do|`|06ZU1L2haa	Yeah you could use a lie detector but it will be too costly in your part. Another thing you can use is a truth serum. But really, the best thing you should do is to talk to her and tell her that all you want to hear are her most honest stories. Tell her that making up "additional" events in her stories ruins her credibility.<br>  <br>  However, if none of the talking works, truth serum isn't that bad.:)|`|0Y89uCinaa	my best friend used to have the same problem with a girl(which also used to be her best friend)<br>  u dont need a lie detector.<br>  tell her!'we want the truth,and if u cant tell us for any reason.we wont be friends anymore.u can't lie to us.we are SUPPOSED to be like sisters!u shouldnt lie!u better tell us the truth!<br>  <br>  options:<br>  1.is she doesnt.dump her.<br>  2.if she has any serious.private reasons dont force her.you cant just make her tell things against her will.privacy!<br>  3.if she does tell u the truth.believe her,and just carry on like it never happened.MAKE HER  PROMISE NOT TO TELL LIES ANYMORE!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  go0d luck<br>  if u talk to her as soon as u can it will be much better!

Communication is key.<br>  My only advice is to please use protection when you finally do.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	There is no timing to anything, everything happens naturally. If its gonna happen it will happen. Don't just assume that you have been seeing someone for a period of time now you gotta have sex. Let things flow, just enjoy the ride.|`|pJcbV2cnaa	Just talk to her and tell her how you feel.

All of this sounds good and its a good thing your sister told him. It's only been a couple of days because liking you is one thing but dating you is another. He's just thinking things through and leave him to it, don't force him out of his shell and don't get annoyed about it. Just leave him to and and when he decides to talk again he'll tell you how he feels and whatever when he feels like it. Just leave him to it basiclly and do not worry, you will stay friends at least.

But please get help there are foundations out there that can remove you from this abuse. Life is way to short to be abused by anyone. I have a first cousin that went through the same thing. She is in her late sixty's and still hurts in her heart for the way she was treated. Get out of this abuse it will not kill the love you have for your mother but do not be killed by your mother. She has a bad issue in her life and only a professional can tell what it is. I don't know your age but if your still in school talk to you counselor he or she can get you some help. Please, Please get out of this abuse before your scared for life and raise your children the same way.|`|DgFhlJvYaa	Im not tryin to be mean, but it sound's like your mom favors your sister's over you for some reason. If your mom cant except you then maybe you shouldn't except her. Im the black sheep in my family & my dad doesn't except me, but I've learned not to care. You need to sit down with your mom & ask her why she say's & do the thing's that she does. There is no reason for her to favor your sister's over you just because your different. You deserve an answer & she need's to tell you the truth. What your mother does to you isn't normal on any level & she need's to except the fact that you are who you are even if she doesn't like it.|`|YcT2qwrtaa	cause u bore people with ur words!!

If you can`t trust, you have nothing.Although you seem to have reason to be suspicious, Learn to accept his flaws, and your relationship will blossom. Question his moves and motives , he will think that you don`t trust him and he will feel in a defensive mode at all times, having to explain where he`s been, where he`s going, etc.<br>   In cases where I have tagged along with a guys only weekend, we basically drank, talked about everything, fished, played horseshoes, ate junk food. There were no other women. We all know each other, and respect each other enough to not go skirt chasing.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	You have reason to worry. His past actions have given you your reasons to worry. I don't see why a married man would still be going on these trips like this. Especially at his age? Don't get me wrong I know of married men who have taken trips, but they aren't all about 'partying' like this trip sounds. I think you and him need to sit down and have a serious talk, and perhaps he should put an end to these trips.|`|TZpFcx47aa	I wouldnt worry. Its a different group. And a group of guys like that, they are all likely afraid that another one will "leak the secrets out". They are all mostly married. Nah. Wouldnt worry about it. His drinking sounds like a problem but really, I doubt that all the other guys are willing to risk their marriages by approving a housefull of strippers.|`|BXd4I9mmaa	Yeah I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were doing that. I was out once with my friend and a group of guys were out that had been friends forever - two were married and they were trying to get us to barhop with them .... <br>  <br>  guys are idiots|`|m84Ml3Opaa	Guys weekends do tend to be about the guys. Yeah, I 'm sure those who are married talk about the ups and downs of marriage but that's only natural. I'd say this trip is like a group of women going on a trip, you can definitely expect us to talk about men (not our husbands), and sometimes our husbands. It was that one time he got out of hand that's one thing, but if it keeps happening then you should be worried. Until then (hopefully not), let him have his fun.|`|tiPnWYHQaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with a guys trip. However I understand why you are concerned, have you talked to your husband about you feel. You have reason to feel this way and he should understand.|`|Nq4vCxAUaa	Trust until proven otherwise.<br>  One of the bedrocks of marriage is trust.|`|aZFu4nZeaa	Why don't  you go on a girl's weekend once a year with your friends.  What is good for him is good for you, don't you think?   See how he reacts to you going away, and if he brings up the trust issue about you, then you can ask him does he not trust you because of what he and his mates get up to?  In fact, if you have any sense, make it a girls' weekend twice a year because you have a few years to make up, don't you?  Get started on the planning now, right now, so before he goes, he knows you are planning the same type of weekend.  If he's up to no good, it might tweak his self preservation and his commitment to your marriage.

Who do YOU think you are? They have the right to do what they want. They wanna be like you. I know it's annoying when people copy you but if you don't wanna be copied, be the nerd no one cares about worse. Wear ugly stuff or make your own clothes that no one else will have.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I've been married for 22 years, and the last time I masturbated was less than an hour ago.  Why in the world would you want to stop masturbating?  That's just crazy talk!|`|POHWTDPRaa	No I didn't. Neither did my wife. Now it's twice as fun. <br>  <br>  Stopping - and I'm not sure why you would want to - is as easy or difficult as stopping anything else. It just requires a little willpower.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy.  <br>  <br>  No, I didn't stop when I got married.  <br>  <br>  Why do you want to stop doing something that brings you pleasure and doesn't cause any harm to anyone?|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Certainly not.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure, from your question, why you would want to stop, but it's healthy and although the women in my life and I have a very active sex life, I still probably masturbate a few times per week.  It's really one of the few indulgences I partake in which are purely for me, rather than being wholly or partly for other's satisfaction, as well.|`|t81MEJ82aa	If you are doing too much then perhaps you need to, but I'm engaged and live with my fiance and haven't stopped, neither has she, and neither one of us wants to stop. We both help each other out sometimes, which is more fun, but we both still do it on our own because we may not need a quick fix.|`|ygimTNzoaa	I moved in with my fiance and for 2 weeks I was covering a co-worker on vacation 2nd shift, my man works 1st shift 8am-430pm. I'd get home at 10:30-11pm and he'd be in bed, for almost the full 2 weeks when I came home I always wanted sex and tried, he's always stop me and say hes to tired. I kind've got suspicious after the 2 weeks and looked online and saw he was looking at porn. I was FURIOUS!! Because I'm hornier then all hell and want sex when I get home and he's already blew one off looking at and thinking about some other chick! That's beyond angering to me because I just can't masturbate even if I wanted, I don't do anything for myself and my fiance knows this. I think it was pure selfishness on his half. Not to mention when we're on normal shifts even he cant have sex more then once a day anyway (he's 43 years old). Which is fine! That's great, but the once you can get off a day you use it on some fake biznich and not me is as bad as cheating in my book!<br>  <br>  Anyway. Yes, he'd admitted it to me and was genuinely sorry I can tell. Since I don't yell and I don't like to argue, I just told him firmly what I think and said, if we cant come to an agreement then we will not be happy. I told him, do not try to lie and "save" the relationship if he even thinks there may be a possability he'd masturbate again unless I was depriving him. He promised never to masturbate again...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think it should be easier for you to stop masturbating once you're married since #1 you live with the girl, and #2 hopefully she doesn't ever deny you sex, god knows I'd never deny my man, I'm the one craving it all damn day. But, it does depend on the girl for that, some girls are stuck up prudes and feel like you have to earn it lol. Good luck with that.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	i think it's different for guys and girls and i'll tell you why:<br>  a lot of girls can only orgasm through masturbation alone so to expect a girl to stop after marriage is just cruel. Men on the other hand, orgasm pretty much every time they have sex. I think it's reasonable to expect a man to stop masturbating after marriage or even in a serious, steady, sexual relationship. Also with men, masturbation can end up interfering with real sex.|`|UEAzzroAaa	I highly doubt anyone stops, there is nothing wrong with it. Unless masturbating comes before a intimate relationship with your partner. That should come first.|`|m84Ml3Opaa	No, I didn't stop after I got married. If your partner doesn't like you doing yourself  ask him/her to join you. I believe self-gratification is better than going out and getting an STD from someone.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	When you get married you'll be able to satisfy your needs in other ways than always masturbating.  But I'm sure you won't stop completely.  Marriage isn't a death sentence!|`|5kIUmkz8aa	I do it a lot less now that i'm married but I still do when I get the chance.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	I didn't and neither has my wife, it doesn't stop feeling good just cause you got married =/|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I didn't.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	no....my girl helps me now...|`|kahqkf2haa	I haven't... I don't see why you'd want to stop, unless you do it at inappropriate times??<br>  It's a very natural way to relieve stress, and feel GREAT!!!<br>  BUT... you are also 18!!!  You're urges will decrease as you get older, and you won't have to do it so often... right now you're in the PRIME of your sexual urgings... so don't worry... it will mellow.|`|X9qrMXQiaa	I masturbated less when I got married but didn't stop. There is nothing wrong with it unless you allow it to get between you and you partner|`|Zeb6RFeKaa	Nope. Sometimes your spouse isn't around to help out with those certain 'needs'.|`|USooqQlWaa	Um no...sometimes we watch each other and help each other out from time to time.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to stop?|`|fKOnp43Maa	Nope. If it feels good do it!|`|uPWcGmLCaa	Why do you want to stop?<br>  <br>  I'm engaged and I still do it.|`|EbUSYjLRaa	no it didn't stop i just found a partner to join in|`|pVBH6iCYaa	dude, you need a girlfriend.|`|PzboDDI2aa	your going to go blind man ! (and dont tell me your going to continue till you need glasses)|`|QHvizgmOaa	yeah and no its hard.sorry i cant help|`|YYAUr8t9aa	nope
3wKGTZvAaa	Stay away from her. Unless you can figure out a way to fight her back...
bL9MSGhDaa	He's a guy. I would think that any guy who flirts with you and doesn't get you to love them back wold say you lead them on. Typical. I think you have the right to be mad because you thought you were friends and he was falling in love with you. Telling everyone but you, which is sad. <br>  <br>  Let it go, you may both need a break from each other and then you can see what happens when you're out of college. You can always keep in touch by e-mailing each other. That's not a bad thing. Maybe you can sort things out that way.|`|Z6wDRR5Vaa	I don't think you should be angry. I think maybe if you take a step back and think about how would you feel if you told someone that you love them and they didn't return the feelings. He is probably trying to make you realize what you don't have anymore so maybe you'll start to feel the same way. You know the old saying " You don't realize what you have til its gone". If you truly feel like you didn't have a clue he felt that way then don't beat yourself up over it. As for your relationship with him now, if and when he talks to again let him make the first move and then let him know how you truly feel. That's all you can do.|`|cB2VGhLgaa	You have a right to be angry, he does not. Were you leading him on? If you are sure that you were not than forget about it. His ego is probably hurt and he needed an excuse to why you said no. If he does not come around and apologize, then you should let it go.|`|l50LNHYKaa	I guess there are many ways of seeing what he meant by leading him on. If you have been friends with him for 3 years it could be small things like you touch his arm now and then, you guys put your arms around eachother when walking , mayb uve cuddled or mayb you havent. bottom line is he thinks is ur fault out of revenge. i had a guy with the same problem and he went out and told everyone my darkest secrets and tried to ruin my life bcuz i turned him down. also mayb deep down inside you do care for him the same way but havent realised it yet. id try to contact him, mayb send him an email you want to grab a coffee and talk. another thing i suggest is to go on a date with him mayb and c if u c any sparks or not. i did that with another one of my good guy friends ive known for not too long but still and we are hapilly together a year later.
YUkzmz1daa	I would be flattered if someone did that. She obviously left a lasting impression with you. Do it, it wouldn't hurt anything.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I don't think that's something to 'impress' anyone with. At the least she may think it was nice of you to say hello.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I would be flattered. And really what's the worst that could happen? She just won't reply if she isn't interested.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	dude, are you that clueless?   were you too busy during zit faced high school years to date?    they didn't offer you 'dating 101' class in college?<br>  <br>  there's an area in back of your 'popular science' magazine,  where there are bunch of ads..    find the one that says "how to pick up girls" and order yourself a book.|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Just sending her a note stating you would like to catch up some time. Give her your email and phone number and make sure your return address is on the envelope.<br>  <br>  You need not impress her, yet.  If she responds positively, set up a date.|`|TZpFcx47aa	What you described seems ok. Flowers or anything else would seem way stalkey for sure. But a simple "hello, call me if you want" is good.|`|XvBPAFqOaa	I think what you would do is perfect. It's not overwhelming or anything and your just checking to see how she is doing. if she is interested at all she will contact you. Put it in the mail. You never know!!
IPS3hWweaa	In. That feels best.<br>  <br>  Yeah, it may drip, but at least you don't have it all over you, your bed, your face, your clothes, your cat, the ceiling, the floor...|`|1GTctcDqaa	It really bothers me when he does that. I let him do it then I just get in the bathtub. He knows that I don't like it, so when we are just getting a quickie in and I don't have time for a bath he will pull out for me. I think it's extremely messy and gross.|`|krQiDGCHaa	In.<br>  <br>  Then again, we are trying to have a baby, LOL.<br>  <br>  Even if we weren't though, I think he could inside me.  He used to pull out, but honestly it feels much better for BOTH of us if he does it inside.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try it.  If you don't like it, have him pull out.  Not really a big deal.|`|mMBzpldbaa	i love it when my man comes inside me. i'm on birth control and don't use condoms with my long term boyfriend. it doesn't drip for overly long and it doesn't smell bad. at least try it once, don't discount an amazing experience without trying it just because your friends say so!|`|bXGwTQy6aa	most people shower afterwards and d/or clean up....if you're on birth control it makes no sesnse whatsoever to pull out...anyways,just talk to him about it....fyi,cleaning and urinating prevents urinary infections after sex...|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I don't care where my husband finishes, just as long as he does.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i can't seem to pull out, because we, about 80-90% of the time,  '***' at the same time.  if i change my 'pace', she screams,  "if you stop, imma kill you".    i like being alive, thanks.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Quite the graphic question, but hopefully it's among us adults. Why not try each way and see which you prefer???|`|UEAzzroAaa	Well hopefully after sex no one just lays there in the mess. Get up go to the bathroom and clean up. Or take a shower! Its messy either way.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Yea its too messy, unless you are going to shower right away afterwords.|`|AA10353286	He pulls out. Never been on birth control.|`|YYAUr8t9aa	I shoot inside.|`|oTmylEGUaa	Talk to him about that.  Why would you ask me?|`|BXd4I9mmaa	lol this is funny.. Yeah it does drip out for a while. haha
AA12055335	You need to realize that it is going to take her some time to forgive you and trust that you truly are sorry and that her friendship actually does mean something to you. You need to prove to her that she is a valuable person in your life because your previous actions have shown her that you do not care. It is going to take alot of time and effort on your part to gain back that friendship, but if you truly don't want to loose her friendship then it will be something that you won't mind doing. First, thing is, you need to regain her trust back.|`|NTUr0t3haa	Don't do anything. Show that you're a better person now through your behavior - a person who wouldn't treat others badly even if depressed. When she sees the change, she'll then start reconsidering.|`|lVIdENvqaa	You have to stand up for your best friend if you care about her.<br>  She may forgive you one day if she feels your friendship is worth salvaging.<br>  Just give her some room for a while and see if she comes around.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Give her some time and some space and then see if she changes her mind but don't push the issue. She'll come around.
adcCJrNxaa	I don't think there really is anything you can do about it. When you started getting serious with her you took on her kid and her baby's father. He's going to be in the picture until that kid makes 18 and there's nothing you can do about it. I personally would stay out of the discussions with him and her, even though he's talking bout you. Simply ignore him! I'm sure it may be difficult but you're the one she's with. He's probably jealous that he's not with her anymore. As far as you being a father to his kids, if the kids are with you and her full time then how is it possible for you not to be a fulltime dad to their kid? He's going to just have to suck it up and be a man and move on!|`|jhNUuz0maa	You can either confront him and tell him he needs to stop telling lies about you, or you should at least explain to your GF, that he is talking stuff about you, and if she believes it, then you and her shouldn't be together. Also, explain to her that he is only doing it so he can try to get back with her. If she doesn't want him back, then she should easily ignore him. If she wants him back, then she will believe him.|`|PxohEvTvaa	Its matters if your trying to be the kids daddy.. I man men get Very protective when it comes to "step" daddies and messing with their baby mothers.. He's probably just jealous because he want his baby mother..
8XKmMBU7aa	Why don’t you want to watch TV<br>  Please Start watching TV, movies, You Tube etc.<br>  Ideas will automatically come in your mind.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|IP2suWFTaa	Because shes not ready to let go and move on.|`|SRZza0cWaa	she still loves you..xx|`|ezT7xruoaa	only if I still liked him and either wanted to get back together with him, or if I wanted to check up on him if he was missing me and met someone else and stuff. <br>  basically, she still likes you or at least still thinks about you all the time.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Maybe she realizes what she has lost and wants to try again or maybe she wants to at least be friends, me personally would have just let dead dogs lie and went on with my life.|`|ruczpWrGaa	im not sure but guys do the same thing.|`|MkfAD8Y2aa	she loves you|`|doKf05E3aa	Females are not the only ones who do that. If you got dumped by a girl that you still liked because of an assumtion you would be calling her and texting her to get her back or talk to her too.<br>  <br>  If you really don't want her back or to ever see her stop texting her back and never answer your phone when she calls. i am pretty positive you are probably playing a big part in this too & what i mean by that is that you probably still talk to her when she calls and probably still text her when she text you. If you stop communicating with her all together then after a few weeks she will get tired and move on.|`|vlCWp7sSaa	Well, maybe because she has feelings for you or because she misses you. I know after me and my boyfriend and I broke up, I thought of him almost 24 hours wondering what he is up to. Eventually that faded and I moved on.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later she will realize that you have moved on too (unless you haven't). Sometimes you just have to break the news that you don't want to talk to her anymore. It will hurt her, but its also for her own good. There is no reason to give a girl false hope.|`|Ka7CVRYsaa	WELL, IF SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG, LIKE CHEAT ON YOU, SHE MOST LIKELY FEELS SORRY AND REGRETS HURTING YOU AND LETTING YOU GO. <br>  WE ALL WANT WHAT WE CANT HAVE, THEREFORE, SHE KNOWS YOU'RE GONE, AND WANTS YOU BACK.<br>  SHE MAY NOW REALIZE THAT YOU WERE A GOOD GUY. LIKE THEY SAY, "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL IT'S GONE".<br>  IF THINGS CAN BE FIXED, THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING. BUT.....YOU BOTH HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER. AND IT WOULD BE A RISK IF YOU GET BACK WITH HER IF SHE DID CHEAT ON YOU. ONCE A CHEATER, ALWAYS A CHEATER!<br>  ****SORRY FOR YOUR BREAKUP******|`|BXd4I9mmaa	She probably still has some slight feelings for you - or she's codependant and wants attention.|`|qE7Er3pRaa	BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE PROBABLY IS DATING SOMEONE ELSE, SHE CANNOT SEE U DO THIS WITH SOME OTHER GIRL AND HAS FEELINGS 4 U|`|AA10883512	It is a wonderful way to annoy you men...I see it is working.|`|Jgfvr05naa	It doesn't hurt to be friends, not every lady does that|`|ljiIgYFoaa	Because she still has feelings for you. Thats the only reason I would continue to call my x|`|PTwQMnTRaa	I wouldn't. But I have a life.  I might check on him, maybe every few months if we'd been together a while.  I was in a relationship for 5 1/2 years.  That's almost like growing up w/ someone.  I am not in love with him, but I care if he lives or dies.  But I don't ask him about anything personal. I don't really care to know. . .|`|4NCf0ksYaa	Let's say she didn't cheat.<br>  What if she was in love with you?<br>  Or maybe she is denying the fact that things are different now, Some people (including me) freak out in situations like this. She was used to talking to you alot (probably) and texting you. Some refuse to quit this habit. It's hard to put into words, she is just basically scared to lose contact with you.|`|uj4W3jwnaa	shes misses you, when uv been with sum1 for long enough, bein apart for jus a few months aint gunna take her feelings for u away! it can take sooooo much longer. its the closure process. but if u answer her calls and talk 2 her, neither of u r gunna get over eachother so be the better person and rise above it. ignore her. simple as. get some closure for the both of u. good luck. x|`|sUH902cDaa	She misses you and properly wishes you hadn't broke up?!? Are you really sure she cheated on you? or even has a new boyfriend? maybe that's why she keeps ringing you because your assuming things that aren't true and she just wants to get back with you.|`|kWxSHsBJaa	well..all my ex's..exept like one still talk to me and i talk to them.<br>  theres nothing wrong with it, ask her if she is serious or if she just wants to keep in touch..<br>  if you want to know the answer as to why she is calling,<br>  just ask! <br>  :D|`|nCMUA50Raa	she wants to hold on to you for one of a few reasons. friendship. to see what your doing with urself. not being able to let go. she still wants you/wants you as an option.|`|FI8aMuAGaa	Some of us have a hard time letting go.  Maybe she regrets breaking up with you.  Tell her you want to move on and to leave you alone.  Otherwise she'll keep playing games with you.|`|bet4Cugjaa	Maybe she isn't seeing another guy, she obviously still likes you, and wants to keep contact with you.|`|c8ot5CwAaa	Ok. If she cheated b4, now shes got another man, and shes still flirtin wit u, shes obviously like not noble. If i were u. Id make her stop messin wit u. Long term relationships never work anyways.|`|Y9eSvxzQaa	she wants to get back with you.  She probably isn't with someone else if she keeps calling you.|`|PxohEvTvaa	No,I left my childs father and wouldn't even wanna call/text him!!<br>  She must still have feeling for ya cause I would have moved on by now|`|lGdcxdvKaa	you are obviously jebus|`|LETd2hQwaa	Cuz I'd still miss him and want to be friends. We were at one point friendly so I figure why should we stop being friends. Obviously I liked you at some point. I just miss you man!|`|8momYAq4aa	maybe its because you is answering her calls change your number|`|y3cp05Pgaa	she still likes you smarty|`|0jcpEDtraa	You're her "backup".  If things don't work out with the current guy, she wants to make sure that you'll still be there to fawn all over her and make her feel good.  It makes women feel good and validated to know that someone we find attractive (and since she used to be with you, she probably DOES find you attractive) is into us.  <br>  Is there any chance that the two of you will ever live in the same town again? Are you interested in rekindling a relationship with her? If the answer to these questions are no, then just ignore her texts and calls and move on!<br>  I'm a girl, but I'll admit it, we do stupid things sometimes.  She needs to get over herself and let you be your own person.|`|8a20c45048431e7cdba59623ee1b83f2aa	She still has feelings for you! and maybe you do for her, otherwise you would just ignor it and wouldnt write about it on here? :)<br>  <br>  If I was accused of cheating, you wouldnt see me for dust though!|`|QbX58zICaa	She still wants you! She's obviously not dating anyone else and she obviously never did when she was with you! Take her back, you should always give someone a second chance :)|`|A59qhZ1Faa	umm i think the answer is pretty obvioius, she still has feelings for you
gaZ5CJw6aa	no it doesn't..<br>  if you have the trust and you get to see him twice a month..<br>  i'd say go for it..<br>  its worth taking a chance..<br>  and hey if it doesn't work out..<br>  you've only just learned from your experiences<br>  Love ya!!|`|1JVAZbt7aa	unfortunatly it does.....<br>  but not if u can drive and stuff|`|3KdzluJNaa	not really. it actually depends on how you look at it. as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder.<br>  <br>  i have a bf who lives in another country. we see each other really rarely, but it makes the relationship exciting and challenging.<br>  <br>  just keep the communication open.
oojO4WAraa	You are doing the right thing.  Just be friends.|`|efe84b7f6da67ab7f16953aec019b750aa	If you "don't feel good about dating him because he's in an open relationship," then don't date him.  Regardless of how you may feel about relationships in general (not wanting anything serious), we never know how relationships will pan out until we are in them, usually.  I do agree that if you begin an intimate relationship, you have to set ground rules up front--"No, I'm not into open relationships...I don't want to share while I'm dating--it brings down our chances of contracting an STI."|`|Cs0sGt4caa	honestly i would never date someone who was doing that to the other person that he is in the open relationship with. what will stop him from doing the same thing to you?|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Well if you're not looking for anything serious then whats the problem? You can't it both ways!|`|pabVvxylaa	to complicated I would stay away|`|Fh76mMuUaa	thats grosss... its like asking for an STD
naequcqlaa	Competers are great things, BUT I'm starting to hear things more & more of the goings on that are happening because of them.  I feel the "My Space" is one of the biggest offenders tho.  Wives & g/fs are finding out things that are so hurting to them & things that normally would NOT happen IF it had not been for the dear computer.  I cannot blame you for any reason in being upset w/what you've just discovered.  He had NO business even looking up an old ex, let alone "acting" on it.  This is such a shame & I know your heart is hurting so badly from it.  You have every rite in the book to be hurt & upset over what you've just stumbeled on.  I feel you have to have a very serious talk about just what's going on between him & this ex of his.  He's a married man w/children & one on the way.  He is disregarding & disrespecting you & your marriage.  I feel you need to confront him w/everything you know, & use much of the things you've posted to talk to him about all of this.  Does he realize this is just putting you & YOUR baby under tons of stress?  Does he realize this just may hurt his own child because of his foolish actions?  Does he even care?  You've got to get this all out in the open & do it as soon as you can to get it out of your mind & put it back on him to figure out just what he is going to do about it.  I honestly don't know IF I'd ever be able to trust him 100% either if I were you.  He has degraded you & your marriage.  He has to admit & take full responsibility for what he's done, what he's doing.  If he is going to continue doing this against you, you have NO reason to accept it nor put up w/it.  IF you do split up, he w/have full responsibility for the support of his 3 children. So you know their welfare w/be taken care of.  I don't know if you have alimony in your state, but if so, then he'll also have to pay for your support too.  His playing around w/your feelings just could end up costing him lots more than he bargined for.  I would NOT be lienient in any way for all he's done against you, all the total hurt he's caused you because he surely does deserve it completely.  But DO confront him in ALL that you know of & who know what you don't know of.  If you play, you pay, & do you ever pay dearly.  We reap what we dow, & this is just what he's reaping by going behind your back playing his foolish childhood games.  If it were me, I wouldn't even be able to look him straight in the eyes!  You might love him now, but that love could very easily turn into resentment.  I am so sorry for all the hurt you're going thru now, as I've been badly hurt in the past by an "ex" of mine.  The day I came to the conclusion it was over, was the day I felt like a ton of bricks had rolled off my shoulders.  I finally was free of it all.  Free not to be hurt any longer. Free to put the past in the past & was able to move on to better things & a much happier future w/o all the hurt & disrespect that had been done against me.  NO ONE deserves to go thru all you're going thru rite now.  The sooner you get rid of it, put it ALL back on him, the better off you'll be.  I know in time you'll be OK tho, so make sure you do hold on to that tho.  I SO wish you all the best, & a future of happiness...:)|`|ygimTNzoaa	Hopefully he hasn't actually cheated yet, you obviously have to talk to him about it, and he HAS to understand he's not aloud to talk to her anymore. It's up to him and his response from there. Good luck with that.|`|jgedIY8taa	This may seem lame and routine, but go see a marriage counselor.  Even if you have to go by yourself.  You'll get a much better insight into your situation than the one you're likely to get on YA.<br>  <br>  One thing I will suggest, is refrain from an angry confrontation, as difficult as that may seem.  It won't do any good, and may do a lot of damage.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this has happened to you.  I know you're angry, but I also know you're hurt.  Make arrangements to talk to a counselor as soon as you can.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Lose him. Yesterday. Take the 2.75 kids along with child support and make a new life for them and yourself. You don't really want to waste another five years on this cheating sleazeball that obviously cares nothing for you, do you?|`|S5x6KNHraa	dump him today|`|Pdn4sAKHaa	well i guess i kinda can relate i found a secret myspace my boyfriend had had where he had pics of his skanky ex girlfriend mind u im 6 months pregnant i comfronted him about it he got rid of the myspace and he told me he just needed to ask her something...i would tell him how much it bothers u and ask him what he would do if u talked to one of your exes....its not healthy and if he does not stop thenu shouuld leave because u deserve someone who will give u his whole heart not someone who will go behind ur back and only give half...good luck sweeetie|`|nMhbzKuJaa	It doesn't sound like he loves you as much as you love him, and when there is imbalance, bad things can happen. He may have feelings for her, but has he acted on them? I do consider this a form of cheating, even if they've had no physical contact. I would suggest to him that they stop talking to each other. If not, you have to leave him and move on.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	Your husband is having an emotional affair. Sometimes, those affairs are more powerful than the physical ones. Talk to him. Give him an ultimatum. Maybe, even separate for a while and if he sees that he is losing you then that might make him change. This happened with my marriage too and I confronted him when I found out. He still kept doing it till he realized that he was losing me. This was 2 years ago and since then things have been great. The both of us discovered were we had gone wrong and fixed it.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I think that you should talk to him about how he truly feels, and what he wants. If he truly loves this other girl, maybe its for the best that you two move on and separate. I know that its very hard, and you still love him, but you can't be with him if his heart isn't all there. Just sit down and have a long talk with him about it. good luck.|`|E84iCYH2aa	Well i would say that u digged your own grave. Why in the first place did you allow your husband to keep contact with his ex? Now that you have dont it, you cant put all the blame on him.<br>  <br>  Just be quiet for a while and if after that it get on you, do talk to him and see his reaction. If he fights with you and tries to maintain the relationship then you just move ahead with your 2.75 kids.|`|GU4S78ejaa	He's pretty much cheating on you! I don't know which 1 is worse, emotional or physical cheating. Either way, it's cheating! I would definitely confront him about this. You need to make the choice if you can stay with him & trust him. Do what's best for you & your children. Good luck!|`|0HUHHzIQaa	2.75 kids? LOL. sorry but... say another one on the way, not 2.75!!!<br>  <br>  Yeah, TALK to him. Tell him it's innapropriate, that he has to cut off contact, or else...|`|72MtoWxRaa	I was in a situation like this. My husband used to text message his ex and would recite the words, "DREAMING OF YOU" by Selena and i broke into his phone and found out. I confronted him and told him that its either her or me. he wouldnt make a decision so i left him. He realized soon after, why him and her broke up and how much he missed me. it was hard to forgive this.  I took his phone and after 5 years, i just let him get another one and told him that if this ever happenss again with anyone, i will leave for good. I woudl confront your husband on this. when your ready of course. But, print the myspace notes out so you have proof this way he cannot tell you that your crazy and dont know whatyour talking about. If you cant forgive and forget, then levae, if you love him enough to move past it, work it out, but you have to give him the ultimatum between you and her and that he better stop. If he choses her and doestn stop, you will know that he never loved you to begin with and that there is someone out there to treat you the way yo deservve.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	It does not matter how long you'll have been together or how much you love him. you need to love yourself first and foremost. There is no moving on from this other than leaving the relationship because i assure you that if he stops talking to this one, there will be another one for sure and there may have been others besides her. So pick up your self esteem and move on. find someone who will respect you because if you accept him back and he knows that you what he has been doing then that is sending him a message loud and clear that he does not have to respect you and that he can do it again and feel comfortable knowing that u wont leave. Again i say that this is a self esteem issue. when a women feels good about her self she is not going to put up with this mess. You can love him all you want but love does not ask that you stay in a unhealthy relationship.

I went through the same thing when I was 16. I ended up moving out and getting a place. It  was a really tuff time and I struggled but I had some good friends that helped me through...but before you move out there are a few things you should do first.<br>  <br>  Try and talk to your mum, not after a row or she has had a tuff day. Say to her that you ahve been thinking about what she said and wanted to talk to her about it. Ask her why she wants you to go? try and take the criticism and see if there is a way you can work through it. If that does not work, try asking a a family friend or someone you know to sit down with you both to help you talk. If that still does not work as your mum if she can help you find somewhere to live. That may help you both to realise thats not what you both want.<br>  <br>  If the situation is unresolvable then you can get support from your local connexions, school mentors or youth workers to help you find a place, or you could go along to the council and tell then you have been kicked out, beware tho they normally try and make you return home.<br>  <br>  My advice is try and talk to your mum first. Let her know how you are feeling.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ZU3cgiDHaa	no you should never feel like you have to leave you home  talk to your mum tell her you feel like she doesnt want you around anymore.<br>  <br>  Maybe you both need some nice time together like going to the cinema or painting each others nails anything me and my mum do it every sunday since we had a big fall out and now we closer then ever|`|9u5A8uriaa	Everyone argues with there mum its life.

Uj5kuzoJaa	Since you were the one in the wrong, then you might want to try talking to her about everything. Tell her that you won't do that to her again and that you can't see your life without her in it. Apologize, apologize, apologize. Then giver her her space. Don't be irritating her and calling her all the time. Once you've said your piece, then the balls in her court. If she's talking to other people, then you might have to let her go. She may have already moved on. The best thing you can do is just tell her what you feel and let her deal with it. Good luck|`|CIqI2CXaaa	i think that you should wait it out. she might be talking to this other guy so that she feels support after you two broke up. you did go out for a while, and she probably doesnt feel like talking right now. just wait it out it'll be fine =)|`|O1HylylMaa	meet her in the park one night with flowers and chocolate and lie on a picnic blanket and watch the stars together. tell her you hav something for her. give her a little romantic note that says all kinds of sweet stuff. dont buy her naything but the flowers and chocolate. when you give her the note look deep into her eyes and say that she is the most beautiful girl ever born. then say i love you and kiss her....happy ending|`|YHsi6fZyaa	Since u were wrong in the relationship u have no choice but 2 wait . you should always do right by someone u took her 4 granted and now she's gone.

AA10266072	You would be surprised.  My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me and started dating someone else 1 week later.  It's hard but you need to go out and do the exact same thing.  Show him that it doesn't effect you at all.  Right now he's expecting you to sit home and cry.  When he sees that you're not doing that... He's going to get a taste of his own medicine.|`|5brlJBGRaa	Im sorry to say but it sounds to me like he didnt want to feel bad about it so he made you think that he still liked you and maybe down the road sometime yall would get back to gether. But that was just so he could get out of the relationship with out feeling like a total ***, then he could do what ever he wanted cause he wouldnt have to face you. Guys... their awsome huh?|`|l2iqJbZKaa	He's probably over it and is ******* some other girl so just move on.|`|46xuKWyEaa	I think he's a douchebag!  It sounds to me that during the pre-break up he was softening the blow, he didn't want to hurt you by saying what he truly felt, but it seems like he wasn't interested in you at all anymore.  I'm sorry he was like that, but he's not worth it.  Honestly if he's that quick to just up and forget you like the last 4 months didn't happen, then you should stop crying about what you lost immediately, because you didn't lose anything, if anything you gained from this.  You gained your right to find someone who really loves you, someone who's going to take care of you and be there for you and let you be there for them, so don't cry about this immature little boy, go out there and find yourself a man!|`|vzRBqU75aa	Hey Hun cheer up :D<br>  I know it's really hard but all u can do is think about the good in life<br>  and that the guy meant for u is out there waiting for u and only u and he <br>  will be Better then all the either ones.

He was over it before he even broke up with you. Move on, he's not worth it!|`|8iZU6zd5aa	maybe he is trying to get  over it by laughing and having fun, or maybe he is just hiding his pain. but he can't dwell on yalls relationship. cause you can't dwell on things its not healthy. but hunny i know how ya feel i dated this guy for almost 2 years and he dumped me and i cried for days. i didn't eat for a while and he acted like nothing was wrong like he never broke my heart. guys deal with things differently. ive talked to him and he was hurting just as much as me, he just dealt with it a different way. me and him are great friends now.<br>  i hope everything goes well and hopefully maybe i helped.|`|snDvwgC8aa	im sorry to hear about your break up.... <br>  see girls wen we break uo we cry and talk trash about the guy to our friend. guys deal with things waaaaay different than we do. just cuz he is laughing and seemingly having fun doesn't mean he has gotten over you. he may still be so hung up on you that he is just trying to do stuff to get you off his mind. im sure when he is alone and there is nothing to occupie him he is probably thinking about you. <br>  <br>  i think you should do the same.... if it is ment to be you will find your way back to him. if it is not some else who will apriciate you will find there way to you.

rpnFxnCQaa	Amber,<br>  <br>  I think that you and your husband should talk. This is key. I have through it so I can relate to you.<br>  <br>  Beside communication, you may want to spice things up ... My husband and I tried this website (recommended by my best friend) ... Hundred sex games ... It is highly Erotic, in its nicest meaning. When my husband and I tried some "games", it was like having a new partner. Like falling in Love all over again. We had still been in love but our relationship has since reached a new level. More completeness.

The biggest things to affect the sex drive for people your age are stress, anxiety, depression, etc. <br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself if any of this things could be going on. If they are, you then need to find out what is causing it and try to readjust your life so that you are happier. If you are in a relationship and lost your sex drive, then maybe you need to be looking at your relationship and asking yourself what is going wrong or bothering you because that too can affect your sexual drive with that person. <br>  <br>  Example, if you feel neglected you aren't going to feel a drive to be intimate with them. <br>  <br>  Example, if you are stressed about school, work, etc. your mind doesn't have the room to even think about sex it is too busy worrying about everything else. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope that you really look into your life and see what factors could be causing this so that you can get your sex drive back and enjoy your young days :)|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	If i was you i wouldn't rush it.But if you are in a relationship and thats how you feel then some is wrong.|`|0EUBc2hRaa	Start watching some videos.

OUvQQJAsaa	Girls aren't impressed by boxers, it's not really a turn-on.  If you want to impress a girl, it varies by person, but definitely carry yourself with confidence (without acting cocky) and give your full attention when they talk to you, even if you aren't really interested in what they have to say.  I do this with guys and it totally works!  Good luck!|`|O1HylylMaa	haha wow. if you really want a girl to like you just be yourself. i hvant had a bf yet. im 13. get over it. showing your underwear is not going to help you get girls. maybe really slutty girls but who wants them? so stay tru to yourself.|`|J8j6vhhpaa	If you're looking to your boxers to impress girls you're looking in the wrong place.  You need to work on respecting girls first and foremost.  Not that you don't but girls want to feel special before they start seeing what's under your clothes.  Don't push things too fast and take the time to get to know them before buying expensive boxers.  Plus girls don't really care where you buy your boxers from as long as they don't have stains, are clean, and are definitely not tighty-whitey's.  Also the sagging look to show off your boxers just makes it look like you don't know how to buy clothes that fit or how to buy a belt to keep your pants up.
zMrhLO7Xaa	maybe hes just not ready,you may be more to him then just to have sex with.wait it out|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Could be. You should ask him. Or set him up|`|4293T0LNaa	if hes done it before then chances are that hes probably doin it again,|`|eO0iByzMaa	Just ask him outright, talk about it with him. It's probably something innocent.|`|mdR98GYMaa	Are you underage?<br>  <br>  Is he gay, maybe?<br>  <br>  There could be a variety of reasons why he's not having sex with you.|`|sKCxxdNBaa	and hole old are you|`|UhWQuxLVaa	oh hell yea...he's cheating....leave him!!!!!!!!!!!|`|c8ot5CwAaa	Girl are you crazy!

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	your fourteen! your not even ready to DRIVE let alone get married.<br>  <br>  and you shouldnt even be THINKING about intamacy....<br>  <br>  dear lord what is with kids in such a hurry to grow up?<br>  <br>  what are your college plans? how do you know you wont meet someone new after high school? are you even IN high school yet?<br>  <br>  your too young, plain and simple, you would need your parents permission to get married, and you cant even legally get married WITH parents permission to your sixteen. and if your parents have even one brain cell in their heads, they wont let you<br>  <br>  your just a kid.  i dont care how mature you think you are, you are a CHILD! how are you going to make money to live on? WHERE are you going to live? cause apartments wont rent to anyone under 18.  you cant even DRIVE yet! <br>  <br>  too young.  your not ready.  and idk what "intimacy" your talking about, but stop it.  your fourteen.  go do your homework. <br>  <br>  in fact, im willing to bet that the only reason he is with you is BECAUSE of that "intimacy".  fourteen year olds and serious relationships is the biggest oxymoron out there.<br>  <br>   lets put it this way.  the guy i was dating at 14 broke up with me, then whored his way through high school, then turned out to be gay.  one of my friends was dating a guy at 14 who turned out to be abusive.  the girl my brother dated at 14 cheated on him.  one of my other brothers dated a girl from 14 on up till the time he started driving, because he "bought the wrong kind of car".  i could go on for days.  do you get it yet? maybe one out of every 50 relationships that starts at 14 actually lasts.  im not even sure the odds are that high, its probably more like 1 in 100.<br>  <br>   give yourself some time to experience life. i thought i had it all figured out in highschool then i was given the opportunity to travel in europe by myself.  it changed EVERYTHING.  i dont even look at the same types of guys i used to.|`|0Id85yiYaa	wow. just the fact that you added the "four days" means that you're too immature for marriage.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	And how much fun do you guys have sharing hours of housework with each other every week?  Or working full-time hours so that you can both pay the bills together?  Being prepared for marriage is about a lot more than having fun dating.  At your age, you will need many more years of dating experience before you are ready for that step.|`|uBssj3Znaa	marriage is meant to be something both people need to discuss and want. However, at 14, you are out of your mind. You have no idea what real life is like, or how the world or relationships actually work. <br>  <br>  What until you are at least legally and adult before you even start to think about marriage.|`|UgcPxd4maa	You are 14 - you aren't even gonna be with that guy years from now. Hopefully you'll have gone through a couple more, gotten some experience, and then start to think about marriage. You're still a kid.|`|AA12370001	you aren't ready for marriage at 14.  You have no idea if this is the guy you want to spend the rest of your life with when you haven't met anyone outside of your school.  There is a whole world out there with lots of people and tons of experiences you haven't even thought of and to say at 14 you are ready to get married show how young and immature you are.  What about high Sheoll?  College? moving to a new city?  You need to live before you settle down.<br>  <br>  Plus you have been going out with a 14 year old boy (yes boy, and not a man) for a one year and done typical adolescent things.  You have completely relied on your parents for shelter, money, clothing, etc.  <br>  <br>  You are in no position nor is he at any time to take over those responsibilities.  Telling a 14 year old boy who has even the smallest shred of intelligence that you are ready to get married will cause him to look at you completely different.  He knows that at 14 marriage isn't something you talk about because he knows neither of you are close to being ready to even think about it.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Routine is not love. Its scheduling a relationship. Which never works. At 14 you are NOT ready to get married. Can you support yourself? Yuo can't even legally get a job. How about renting or buying a house? You have no transportation besides mommy and daddy and once you graduate high school your wants and needs change drastically and your boring routine relationship will no longer exist. Grow up, have a life as a kid for a little longer, than decide once you graduate in 4 years if that's still what you want.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	This sounds fake. I have never heard a 14-year-old use the word "flourish" or "blossom."<br>  <br>  Anyway, you arent even allowed to legally sign the papers at 14. How will you live? You cant drive, you arent even old enough to rent a hotel room. Trust me, people change more than you will ever realize in just the one year after high school. You are still in jr. high and i would bet large amounts of money you will not be together 3 years after you graduate. That is just how things are.|`|AA10698792	You're not 14...no 14 year old writes like this, much less uses words like intimacy, flourish and subtly. Although the misspelling of gossiping was a nice touch.<br>  <br>  Try again|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Oh, grow UP.|`|rHrcGklWaa	wear a see through top.|`|KLZGmyL4aa	your 14!! u are NOT ready..enjoy ur young life w/him, create lots of memories w/him before you decide you want to get married|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Hey hon. I don't wanna be rude or anything, but your 14 years old. Its great that you and your bf get along so great and everything. but 14 is way to young to be wanting to get married already. Its ok to dream and hope for the future when your older, but you can't get married when your 14. At the earliest you can get married at 16, as long as your parents consent, but they most likely wouldn't. I personally think that no one should get married until they are at least 18. I know you think you really love this boy, but chances are you will still have many more boyfriends down the road. I know how you feel though, I was your age once too, but you gotta be realistic, and marriage is not an option at your age. good luck.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	Firstly your extremely too young sweetie you may think your in love and its all dandy but you have yet to experience life...i work for vital records where you come to apply for your marriage licenses and i see it all to often your parents have to be there to sign papers and give you the permission to be married you have to be 16 to have consent. Im 21 yrs old have a child with my bf and we have been together for 2yrs and i am far from ready to get married and i have thought about it but its not the time and thats what you need to think about your too young and your not ready odds are you will be divorced be for you know it...take you time!!!!
41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Just leave her alone. She will cause nothing, but trouble and the more you tell her that her bf is an a**hole she's just going to want him more. Some people have to fall before they understand.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	do you actually think that any of us here gives a damn about your 10 points?   <br>  <br>  worry about your grades,  get into a decent school, become a doctor making tons of money and you'll have hotties throwing themselves at you. <br>  <br>  life is that simple.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	Just be there for her as a friend she is going to need you when her boyfriend knocks her up and dumps her.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can play daddy to her child.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	Just back off and give her some space.. sounds like she needs to learn all the things you see on the outside on her own. Teenage girls think they know it all until they find out different.|`|f1907Oehaa	Go to school, and learn to spell.|`|gnom5J8Naa	Move on!|`|vmdufHUWaa	you got issues leave the bi*ch alone and move on don't waste your time|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well just talk to her and tell her that you dont get jelous and angnor her|`|Wj212FWXaa	how about you dont date children. <br>  <br>  <br>  btw... this is posted in the marriage section, did you know?|`|4ZnaeHozaa	Dude a fifteen year old is waaay to young to even think about getting serious with.  Trust me when I tell you that the best for you is still to come.  You haven't even lived yet.  When I was your age I wouldn't listen to this advice either but put it in the back of your mind so when you're thinking with the right head you might remember this.  You don't want to get into a life which has addictions as baggage.  Get your education, go to college, find a career and trust me when I tell you the right girl will come along and you will know. She will only have eyes for you and you won't have to deal with BS on the side.|`|CFPyF2eoaa	alrite this is kinda a bad situation lol. umm..well first things first.if you havent sat down and had a calm talk with her about it then you should definitely do that.if hes hitting her and stuff, you definitely need to make sure she understands that although he might say sorry, and honestly mean it hes probably gonna keep doing it because hes probably not gonna learn to control it.say by having a baby shes gonna throw her life away..and that the whole baby scheme may be a way to just be able to have sex with her, but i cant really tell cause i dont know the guy. tell her having a baby is a person not a toy.if you screw that up, you cant buy a new one.and that her life will be then centered around the baby.if i was you..id say that your interested in another girl so she'll think what your saying is legit.but thats just an idea, it may not work.if this doesnt work, this talk i mean.then you should go to her friends and talk to them about it.if THAT doesnt work then..as dumb as this sounds...go to her dad (assuming hes been present in her life and good for her), because hed be ALOT less leaniant then her mom.though shed probably dislike you if she found out.<br>  <br>  alrite on to you guys relationship.it seems like she may be playing you.i mean she knows you like her and she hits on your cousin? that doesnt sound like someone whose being sincere.now, granted, she does need you right now.but if i was you, after all this, and you think shes finally ok.id try to detach myself away form her.your being a good guy and trying to help her, and shes being a *****, sorry, but its the truth.wether shes doing it on prupose or not is another story.but yeah, helpful enough?|`|E9cVmcEbaa	I can tell you from experience the best thing to do is move on. And if you find somebody else you like that's great. But alot of times when you move that person will realize how much they really care about you. So maybe you moving on would make her realize how much she likes you and wants to be with you. Now that's not a guarantee but it happens 75% of the time. It's happened to me twice in my life. I know you tried to help her see the light but she's the only one who can see what a idiot she's with now and decide to leave him..More than likely if she see's you with someone else she'll change her mind and want you..but it's not a guarantee...Hope this helps..Good Luck..<br>  P.S. There's more than a million other fish in the sea..|`|Q4QgXqIRaa	she needs more time. just give her more time and keep letting her know you care about her, she will come around. best of luck :]]|`|bJXqOWCcaa	Don't try to intervene or break them up.. then she will be mad at you! Just keep being her friend and offer her support. Let her know that you would never treat her bad! And if there are any secrets you find out about her bf that she does not know.. let her find them out! Make sure to not get involved with their relationship.. just help yours grow.?|`|s0BdkHbpaa	you sound like a nice person who wants to help her but on one hand she may want to be with this looser who treates her bad on the other she may be to scared to leave him. if you really like this girl try talking to her about how many people are murdered because they have stayed in a abusive violent relationship the violence will never stop one a woman beater always a woman beater. i hope the girl sees sence and leaves him.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	mate she is playing you wake up mate .. and MOVE ON.. ITS TIME TO GO FREE  and party .. that will get her back.. big time .. but dont go with her she will only break you down again sorry mate|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	No **** you should move on. You did your best! If she doesn't care about her life  then it is her choice. You should find someone else, Srry.|`|dMcpULcdaa	You can only help people, as long as they want/need to be helped. Obviously you have tried numerous times to help so just move on. Its hard i know bud sometimes that the only thing you can do once you have done everything else|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	what?|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Why are you putting your life on hold for something that MIGHT happen.  Honestly, live your life.  She will wake up one day and realize the mistakes she's made.  You tried to help her.  Don't miss out on an opportunity in your life b/c you've put it on hold for so long.|`|wF3Znuodaa	Yeah this girl is not appreciating what she has in front of her its really stupid to be quite honest. let her go. I guess she likes to be treated like trash (many girls like that), so yeah I say you move on forget about her. You tried to help her and she took the wrong way. and sadly she is going to realize she made a big mistake but that will be very very late!|`|RLoilwCNaa	Move on dude. She has way to much baggage and is going to be pregnant soon with that losers baby. Get out now and move on. It's the best decision you will every make. You tried to help and she doesn't want it. You can't help someone  who isn't willing to help themselves.|`|8JtGkqDGaa	i know you care about this girl but it sounds helpless. you should let her go. she either can't stop what shes doing our doesn't want to. she put herself in this situation and you can't save everybody so let her go. shes going to destroy herself and if your not careful she'll take you down with her.|`|6cm6MB66aa	Get over it there is lots of queens out there . Sounds like she like the mack daddy and you cant change that|`|JnlYIzwdaa	i think move on and just find some one else change your numbr and make shure no one gives it too her|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	sounds like you need to move along to the next.<br>  she's playing you.<br>  shes wrong for that.|`|RiQA4Epraa	shes stupid<br>  wait 3 years<br>  <br>  maybe shell be halfway smart by then|`|I3PdIX0Kaa	Well darlin' - I think you answered your own question.  "I want to move on already i had enough of this..."<br>  <br>  So move on.  She is "staring" at you because she is trying to see if she can play you AND him.<br>  <br>  MOVE on.  She is too young to know what she wants... she obviously wants the bad boy.... and she is going to get herself into a whole mess of trouble.<br>  <br>  Why do you want to stick around to bail her out, support her and the kid she will most likely have from this fool??  <br>  <br>  Why don't you focus your life on making yourself a better person... trust me - there are girls out there who are going to appreciate the fact that you know how to treat a woman right.<br>  <br>  So now is the time to start treating yourself right.... YES... stop talking to her, change your number, and let her live her crazy life.  No need to mess up yours!!|`|aDhZIhQcaa	What are you doing?????  Why are you basing your life on an idiot, immature girl who doesn't know her butt from a hole in the ground?  Get some pride some self esteem, and self love and close that door, now!  You have to ask yourself why you would care?  Why would you even want a "girl" that has been sexually active with another guy?  Ew, she is considered tainted, and why would you want to even have this guy's left overs????  Find out who you and what you want in your life.  Get out of her soap opera and her drama, unless you like the drama????  Good luck
u7LSohRyaa	You're not the one in trouble. Your friend is. Things are going to get worse for her. Hope she doesn't end up dead. I know how frustrating it can be to see someone you care about refusing to hear any advice you have to give. I hope that guy gets arrested. She's not going to listen to anyone who tries to help her because she idolizes this bad boy. The more drama there is, the more she holds on. You're boring to her right now. Hopefully, they break up for good and she gets some sense. One day she'll realize that she's addicted to this man and she can't be friends with him anymore at all or she'll get hooked again. He's like a drug to her. Maybe then you'll have a chance. Don't hang around waiting or you'll get dragged down with her. She has to have him out of her system and get a clear head first. She'll respect you more if you don't chase her anyway. You just never know. She might leave him and find someone else just like him or maybe she'll settle down.|`|AA12324252	Move on,you don't need the drama. Your too young to fix this mess. Let her learn from her mistakes. You can't do it, she has too.----RUN!------|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	She is seriously messed up. You need to focus on other things and keep busy so you arent thinking about her. You don't need all this drama in your life. Focus on your future and quit talking to her. Don't have any contact with her at all. Everytime you do you will get drawn back into her sick world.
BYQ2kHPjaa	Unfortunately there isn't much you can do, but let her go and move on. If she really cared about you, like you care about her then she wouldn't treat you that way. You've just got to let her get on with her life and make her own decisions. You could try to just talk to her one last time and tell her that you just care about her and dont want to see her get hurt. And if that doesn't work, then at least you can say you tried. Good luck xx|`|yQCg9Kemaa	So how can u get a girl back who has absolutely no feelings for u but has mildly flirted with u for fun!!??  you are wasting ur time thinkin about her.. coz nothing wud change her mind.. no matter what u say she will think that u r jealous and want to ruin her present relationship.  Please stay away from this mess... there are so many pretty girls out there.. dont ruin ur life for someone who fails to understand ur genuine feeling. Be bold and be a man...forget her and start and fresh life... love will come looking for u.. u dont have to run after any !!|`|oIFMohfUaa	You can't fix HER problems!  You'll just make yourself sick.<br>  <br>  Move on.  If later she wants to come to you, so be it.  THEN you can decide if you want her still.  <br>  <br>  At this point, it's just drama YOU DON'T NEED.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Why would you want someone like her? she doesn't sound a great catch to me at all.
P0Fjh59Eaa	Your ex moved out 6 mths ago, but the BF was around 8 mths ago...hmmm interesting.<br>  <br>  Lemme ask you a question, if your ex had a GF would you be all that keen on her watching your kids by herself? I know i wouldn't want someone who was basically a stranger to me, watching my kids w/out me getting to know them first.<br>  if this relationship is serious and this new guy is here to stay i suggest you all sit down together for an adult conversation and lay it out for him to know that things are serious, and that he needs to find a way to accept that. no he cannot dictate who you see, but he does have some say in who is around his children.<br>  <br>  My ex was the same way w/my 2nd husband before we married. after we sat down and discussed things he behaved himself and they are actually on very good speaking terms now, as am i w/my ex's wife.|`|kbz5S3waaa	asking the same question back to back isn't going to get you any better answers...|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Your ex is entitled to his feelings and opinions on the matter, but as long as the children are not in any danger, he has no legal say in who you allow to look after them or be around them.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Until you are married your ex has every right to say who looks after his kids. To many boyfriends abuse children and I am sure that you would not want this to happen. When he does ask you to marry you, then your husband won't have much to say, but you might want to check and make sure the new one doesn't have a record. That is the least you should do to make sure your kids are not in danger.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	6 months is not long enough to fully know anyone.<br>  <br>  Your ex is right to be concerned.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Asking it again is not helping you.|`|t26ctJdraa	ur x is right!! just cuz u love ur new man doesnt mean he could b trusted around lil kids. u dnt no his past.|`|6cm6MB66aa	I don't blame him .

Your significant other or some stranger you met on the internet? If it's your spouse then maybe he wants to surf adult websites together to add a little spice to your sxx life. If you feel comfortable with that, then go for it. Or maybe he wants to share intimate stuff over a webcam with strangers on the internet... <br>  I know couples who have a lot of fun doing this stuff, but do what you feel comfortable with. <br>  <br>  If it's a stranger I'm guessing he wants some explicit chat and webcamming/swapping pics. <br>  <br>  OR maybe he's just into computer video gaming :)|`|USooqQlWaa	He wants to send you dirty messages and whack his c*ck while looking at your picture(s).|`|j8aCEtg8aa	You've never heard of cybersex?

I don't like guys skinnier than me, and i also don't like guys who are so big their arms don't go down to their sides.|`|AA12148009	Average but some muscles, but not hugee.|`|NW1oQMtGaa	Average and muscular and defined body...what you mean muscle head???hmmm|`|l8yXj7uWaa	sweet heart honestly i dont really care whether the lad is Skinny, Musclehead, Average, Fat, Chubby, coz tbh i fall in love with their personalitly!<br>  <br>  dont change for anyone, you are who you are,:)<br>  <br>  x|`|n2cUQuUHaa	i like guys who are pretty average with at least a little muscle showing off, but if they dont thats fine too, i dont mind guys with a little meat on them but not obese if you can help it and DEFINETLY  not superr skinny oi HATE that|`|HwTMMVd7aa	i guess average<br>  well i consider average to be skinny with an athletic (semi) muscular tone to his arms and stuff<br>  <br>  hottttt|`|lfDDdq4Gaa	skinny/average with muscles. but thats only cuz i am skinny/average.|`|vzRBqU75aa	Hey hun.<br>  U r who u r don't look at that stuff the girl meant 4 u will love <br>  u for who u r don't go changing ur self to be bttr. best of luck :D!|`|66AZhLnEaa	Average|`|zBC6n34Naa	Different strokes for different folks.|`|kgzkyUMNaa	It varies from woman to woman.<br>  <br>  My guy is perfect for me, he's tall & slim, but with a little bit of muscle on him.<br>  <br>  Too much muscle is just noo... to me it looks as bad as obese.<br>  <br>  Chubby isn't a problem really, I once crushed on a chubby guy for a looong time.<br>  <br>  Boys that are skinny are cute, but I feel too maternal over them personally.<br>  <br>  I think when it comes to women, we feel more attracted to a personality than a body. Once we like someone, the rest of them seems more attractive.|`|SaTa58emaa	Average... but muscular. You should be able to pick up the girl you are dating... but not crush her. ;) <br>  <br>  I don't like when guys are too muscular, it looks odd, and I know that I won't get any attention from him, cuz he is too into himself an his weights.|`|DTkla5dqaa	skinnnny boys are adorable|`|c7FKefEyaa	Average.. i can do chubby.. NOT FAT.|`|Z6mKM1DOaa	Of course, the answer to that will be different with every person you ask.  Personally, I don't like really skinny guys.  While I don't like obese guys, a few extra pounds is OK by me.  I also don't like overly muscular guys either.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	That depends on the person and culture. Some groups love a thin feminine guy, and some love a muscled, masculine guy. It's rare when some like fat  unless the viewer is fat themselves. Chubby is cute to me.
yr1hEsa0aa	I grew up with a dad that also drinks. He had a great job never missed work. Same thing never got violent or anything either. I never had friends over because I hated him drinking and acting stupid around them. He never wanted to leave the house. Not 2 mins of being home from work there was a beer in his hand.  I really have a hard time dealing with it also. I think its just how they deal with their problems. At first it was fun to get drunk. After that they just started drinking to forget and now its a habit. <br>  I wish my dad would try to hide it. At leasts your mom says she hates it mine just goes and gets him a beer like he wants. I think if it bothers you that much you need to tell your dad. I'm having a very hard time figuring out how to do that myself. I was thinking about writing him a letter. Even if I wait a little a while to give it to him at least its out there. Have you ever thought about talking to some one about these? Even a pastor?.....just some ideas if you want to send me an email feel free even if its just to vent.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Listen to  Billy Currington "Walk A Little Straigher"
fbaKREQuaa	that they have never done anything bad. they are pure..|`|NQI9JD5Gaa	They must be a child... only children are pure, if they do something wrong it is still ok because they don't know better yet?<br>  in an adult it is False.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Pure is an evil word.  It's used to justify the judging of people as good or bad.  And it has no real meaning when applied to people.  <br>  <br>  You could have pure sugar (refined), or pure water (distilled), but never pure people.  <br>  <br>  That's what I think when you mention pure as related to people.
zWB3jHHPaa	eh not really.<br>  i dont think guys are that special to have them screw with my head..|`|AA10835302	Yes a relationship and make you temporarily unstable if during the relationship you placed all of you hopes, dreams, and happiness on that person.  The goal is to learn to love yourself enough to be strong when the relationship fades.|`|7KhIn4HJaa	Yup my previous one . I felt like I was in hell back then . I love my current relationship he makes me feel worth it :) Everything is just perfect .|`|sCr2iTczaa	Yes and it sucks because i don't think i will be able to have a descent relationship ever again.|`|hWvvrEphaa	Yep. I'm still going through the motions actually. <br>  <br>  I went out with someone for almost 2 years. No one else I had ever been with had such an impact on me. I don't know what it was but this person made me do things I would never dream of doing. It's been 4 years and I'm still trying to get him out of my life. Hes not a bad guy, I just fell hard for him. We were deeply in love but could never manage to get back together. It drove me nuts. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the answer is a big fat yes.|`|1aa144095adebf42cce12852a93fd34caa	Yes, but not like crazy unstable. Just depressed.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	not 'unstable' per se, but certainly stressed out.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Crazy people make normal people do crazy things.

AA12324252	BLOCK OUT HER NUMBER AND CHANGE YOUR E-MAIL.Contact the police in her area and lay a charge for stalking.This is BS,don't take it.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Just be careful and lock the rabbit cage, (Fatal Attraction), and to answer your question yes there is some crazy people out there, some just more annoying than others.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Have you thought about changing phone numbers. She wouldn't be able to contact him then, and you can live happily ever after. If it does continue then you need to contact the law and tell her that she won't stop, but you have to make an effort to break all means of contact she has with him.|`|IvMPh09baa	hmm... something sounds really fishy with this... seriously.  I don't think any girl would be so obsessed about your fiance unless there was more to their relationship.  Are you sure he wasn't/isn't two timing you both?  She just sounds way to possessive for this to just be a fling... I'd do some more research about her and his relationship... it just doesn't sound right to me.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Apparently yes.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yes, girls (and guys) this crazy really exist.  Celebrities have more than their fair share.  You're dealing with one, why would you think they don't exist?  (I worked with one.  I could not believe the dumb sh*t she did.  even had an angry wife show up at work telling her to stop stalking her kids.  She DID NOT have an affair w/ the husband.  She just fancied him and started following him and sending him Xrated love letters and then started following the wife and kids.  The man never did anything to encourage this woman.)<br>  <br>  restraining order is your next step in this process.  Hopefully, eventually, she'll tire of the game and move on.  However if she is like a celebrity stalker then she'll make a couple of personal appearances before she goes away.  I don't want to scare you but keep your eyes open for anyone strange watching your house or following you.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Other than change your email/text/cell identities, she hasn't broken the law, especially 1,000 miles away.  Is she crazy?  Oh yeah...big time - no boundaries and I suspect she's bipolar or a bit schizo.  Whatever, not your problem nor your finace's.<br>  <br>  He needs to alter his facebook id and cell phone and email to get rid of her I think.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Yes the ydo exist i have met some of them myself. It is unfortunete that girls feel the need to throw themselves at men, but that is just what they are girls. No worries eventually she will get the point. I would block her number so he cant get text and calls from her anymore.|`|cHiv6eTWaa	This is all very imature high school stuff, just ignore the silly childish witch she'll evenually go away.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	There are laws against cyber-stalking. Report her.|`|bf6K6uubaa	First of all it seems like you're right it was more than what your fiance is saying it was...also he might be giving her false hope...I don't know you were there when he contacted her and told her to leave him alone so if he was firm and she is still insisting then yes she is obsessed with him.  There are certain things you can do but the best option is to make sure she is ignored.  I am sure he can block her on facebook and that should be the end of it.  I would have him  change his phone # because if he is really ready to be with just you he should do whatever it takes to make you comfortable.  Some girls insist on something that is not even there other girls insist only when they think the guy still likes them....you need to be sure of whats really going on here.  Have him change his info and you wont have to worry about her anymore.  If he refuses to or gives you excuses then that should bring a red flag to your relationship|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	What do you mean do they exist? Obviously they do, you are currently dealing with one. It seems your fiance has done all that is necessary, now he needs to change his number. And hopefully, she does not get his address. She is probably quite capable of showing up at his door. If the phone calls do not stop after he has requested this of her, I would go to the police station and file harassment charges against her. Can you say "FATAL ATTRACTION"?|`|krQiDGCHaa	That is absolutely insane.  Yes, people this crazy really do exist.  Ugh, sorry you guys have to go through all that!<br>  <br>  Honestly, even if he did have an AMAZING relationship with her, the point is it's over.  He told her so, and he told her to leave him alone.  She needs to do so.<br>  <br>  I think his response was perfect.  He called her and told her to stop calling.  He keeps ignoring her facebook request.  He needs to continue to do this.<br>  <br>  The only other suggestion I have is for him to change his phone number, and to change his e-mail address. <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Don't let some crazy lady come between you! ;)|`|zgDQrI2uaa	I think the "little fling" was waaay more than what he's led you to believe and I would ask him a few more questions about their relationship, only because this is affecting you as well.  <br>  <br>  I would advise him to change his phone number and give up the Facebook account and make another one that would be set up to be more anonymous.  She's 1,000 miles away so she's not going to be able to harass y'all very easily after these things are done.  <br>  <br>  If the behavior continues I would suggest he files a report, but he may have some flack because he has called her.  Law enforcement does not entertain people who claim to be stalked, yet contact stalkers, so make sure he doesn't contact her again so he can file a report with credence.  Best wishes.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	I had a similar problem. Except they were together for 7 years off and on. She continued to call non-stop and text. Trying every strange tactic possible to get him to respond to her. <br>  <br>  He ignored her until she finally stop (so far).<br>  <br>  Just ignore her she will eventually lose interest.|`|72MtoWxRaa	If you want this girl out of your lives, delete you face book pages, change your numbers, emails, etc. That is the only way. This way she has no way of contacting him, ever...|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	uh file harassment charges against her. She is nuts. No matter what you say to her she won't give up. Tell her next time she calls that you are going to call the police. Maybe that will change her.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Sounds like a perfectly ordinary woman; wholly unremarkable.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Change his phone number. She sounds like a nut. Just be glad she lives so far away. Some people just won't take no for an answer.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	yes.<br>  my 3 door down neighbor recently stabbed and killed an ex NFL player's pregnant GF.   they really do exist. chicagoTribune.com|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	he must be very good in bed and he might have given her the best 6 weeks of her life....n yea ive heard of crazier girls|`|9BsyKN9haa	Ummm, 1000 miles away isn't that far for a crazy girl, i would so watch my back if I were you! She is crazy!|`|AA11252103	yes 100%|`|u8MOrhnvaa	I think you're finance is not tell you the whole truth...sure she might sound bit crazy but I 'm wondering what you're fiance is doing to lead her on like this. he could simply block her number or change his number so she can't contact no more. I belive that he still secretly talks to her giving her false hopes,  and not telling you about it. I wouldn't worry so much about her, more about him. So what if she is crazy, why can't he change his phone number, hopefully the foolish boy didn't give out his address.
47P7uLV6aa	You should ONLY hit a person if you are willing to accept the consequences.  First of all, s/he might hit back -- are you ready for that?  Secondly, in the world today, even TOUCHING someone can be called assault, hitting someone can really get you into a LOT of trouble with the law.  <br>  <br>  Only once was I ever so angry that I seriously wanted to HIT her, but knowing that she'd hit back -- and probably a lot harder! -- stopped me.  Most things are simply not worth all the trouble you'd get into!<br>  <br>  Try to be the bigger person and just walk away.  Good luck.|`|96cbcb40ff362ebaa611683da9bb280daa	if a person is bugging you and they dont leave you alone call the cops and get a restraining order against them.<br>  Hitting someone is never the answer for anything you will just get more problems with that person and then with the law.|`|88bDvyiwaa	kick him squaa in the nuts|`|EJWphb88aa	1st tell him poiltely that u r annoying and we cannot entertain you<br>  <br>  if he doesnt understand then<br>  <br>  Punch him, kick him, through him out of ur house...|`|OF7ZHq19aa	I don't get it|`|kMyERo6uaa	well, u needa chill out.<br>  & Love2Snow!!<br>  how's you get ur avatar like that?|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I have never been mad at anyone so much that I wanted to do that.

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I would never tell my wife that.<br>  <br>  I didn't get married until I was 32.  <br>  <br>  She was 39, married for 8 years, 2 kids, and then divorced for 8 years.<br>  <br>  My comment - over the 24+ years of our marriage, is that it took me a long time to find what I was looking for, and I picked her out in a crowd.  Since then, I stopped looking and just do not get myself into situation like flirting with someone else.  Why should I?  I have what I want.<br>  <br>  Someone else MIGHT be nicer with "A".  Or better at "B".  But when you consider the total package I got (my wife), I'm happy with her.|`|plBXp91Daa	I would feel little bit offended if my husband would say that this girl at his work place look better then me, and what can you do about it at least he isn't really int rested in her|`|6FoESYWRaa	No way... You should never tell a women that another women is prettier than her even if it's true, the fact that he is even mentioning her to his gf indicates that he's probably interested in her. She gf should explore her options and get rid of him.|`|Bm4cPW8naa	A guy should not tell you another girl is prettier than you... that is just asking for a fight... I would just sit him down and be upfront about... " You know that really hurt when you said that..." and then from there just say how else you feel about it and ask him|`|CyHJlCZXaa	I certainly would not be happy and would seriously consider my relationship with him. I respect the fact that he may find other girls more attractive than me, but i don't need to hear about it.|`|TXeUeiPHaa	I would be mad.|`|9W48OvAraa	I do not know that I would mention that she is prettier-If I thought she was I may or may not mention it. He could be telling you about it because it might make you jealous of him or he could like the fact because it makes him feel good to be liked by someone else. OR he could be telling you because he really loves you and wants you to know he is being faithful. These are not wrong/right feelings, they just are.<br>  You worrying about him showing anything back to her is grounded in your insecurities-again, not good/bad right/wrong they just are. We all have feelings of jealousy from one time or another but it truly is our own insecurities thinking that the person we love will leave us or be taken by someone else etc.<br>  Now if a guy or gal is a dog (in their behavior) then accept it or move on.

I would leave the guy if that happened to me.|`|n2cUQuUHaa	He is probably trying to make you jealous for some reason, but he should not be telling you that she is prettier than you  epsecailly if he says he love you. he may enjoy the fact that she is interested in him as an ego boost but he hsould not be flaunting to you like that, i think you should tell him how you feel about that and if hes trying to make you jealous hes going about it the wrong way.|`|B3oozIGyaa	If someone loves you, then surely the only person in their eyes would be YOU.<br>  <br>  Alot of people in relationships will look at others but it doesnt mean they want them instead of their partner or anything..<br>  <br>  it depends ... i would be so mad if i was told that! :(<br>  <br>  xx|`|QIYHApEkaa	If ANY guy was stupid enough to say that to his girl then he's looking to be in the dog house!

Ask him why you think that girl is prettier than you.. what makes him say that or stuff... its not easy to hear words like that coming out from someone you reallly love.. my opinion is maybe he is mad at you.. cause in some cases things like that are best kept to yourself.. if u feel angry you have the right to be.. if he is a good bf.. he will never treat you bad or tell you stuffs like that.. he should telling you things like.. how he adores you.. how beautiful you are.. or u know.. stuff that will make you feel like you dont have to be insecure..|`|tIcaaznaaa	Personally for me it's not all about looks, being a good person and having a good personality is much better!

I met my now husband online when I was 19 and my mom was pretty freaked out about it. When I brought him home to meet her after our first date (upon his insistence) she calmed down.

Q1MPlkhjaa	You would be fine with a budget of $1200. I just bought my Maggie Sottero dress and it totaled $600 including the tax. I ordered it through a local bridal shop who ordered it directly from Maggie Sottero. Her dresses are absolutely beautiful, and I agree, there's just something about the way she makes her dresses that make them absolutely beautiful. <br>  <br>  Here is a picture of my dress:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.topbridaldresses.com/pic/WD/MiaMarie/MiaMarie.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.topbridaldresses.com/pic/WD/M...</a>|`|gg6ZeQQVaa	The dresses range from about $600 for the destination line to up to $1500 for some of the more pricey ones.  Most fall into the $950-1200 range.  Your best bet is to look up the style name on <br>  Bestbridalprices.com<br>  This will show you an approx price for the dress.   They say that they have the best prices, but my local shop sells them for less than that site actually.  But it will at least give you an idea of what you can expect to spend on the particular style.  Good luck.|`|HQYfR5hBaa	I went to a local bridal shop and got a maggie sottero dress.

It is far more important to care and cherish a true friend, which she has proven to be, then care for a fleeting friend, which is the MOH. <br>  <br>  The sad fact is that within ten years, you all will be looking at your wedding pictures and wondering what ever happened to MOH.  So many folks will tell you that the very last time they saw one special friend was on their wedding day.  It sounds like MOH may be one of these people from whom you will soon grow apart.<br>  <br>  Some folks are jealous and can not deal with your happiness, your MOH might be going through some seriously tough times right now and does not want to bring you down by openly discussing them with you, or who knows?

I'm passive aggressive so I would just cut a check and hope my MOH reimburses me. Honestly, that may work out for you though. That way you can casually mention to you MOH, "Oh, by the way: BM needed to get reimbursed for some of my shower expenses, so I just gave her a check. Whenever you get the chance, think you could get the money back to me?" You may never see the cash again, but think of it as an investement in peace.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	She is your MOH, you know her better than anyone, You should talk to her. And if you don't get a response from her,Tell her that you have changed your mind about her being your MOH, that should get some kind of action from her.If not you might be better off with out her.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	YOu have nothing to do with this...tell your bridesmaid that..if she has a money problem ask her to talk directly to the MOH..<br>  <br>  you shouldnt have to get involved on this, but if shes totally refusing it then i guess you might have to pay..|`|sLLgERQWaa	This issue is between the maid and the MOH, NOT you....you need to let them hash it out......and even if she stiffs your maid, SHE will look like the idiot, NOT you.....stay out of it. Good luck.|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	This sounds like your MOH is my soon to be sister in law and in my experience with this kind of person.... no one will ever see a dime from her because she is the kind of person that thinks everyone owes HER and not the other way around. If she thinks everything is a personal attack on her, then she also doesn't think she should have to pay for anything either. She IS the MOH after all! My sis in law is the exact way and trust me, your BM should just cut her losses now instead of create more drama ahead of your big day.|`|JtJxVBOsaa	Ask your friend if she can wait until the rehearsal dinner to get paid. Give her your MOH's number, and if she hasn't paid her by then, have your friend call and ask if she can bring the check to the rehearsal. Bring a check of your own just in case the MOH doesn't bring one. If the MOH doesn't bring her check, make sure to give a special toast to your bridesmaid thanking her for the shower. Tell everyone that she did an amazing job with the food, flowers, and whatever else she put time and effort into. Don't bring up the money with your MOH, and don't mention in the toast that your bridesmaid paid for everything.|`|lvOR401haa	Eeek!  I thought MOH's were there to lessen the bride's stresses?<br>  <br>  I think it's perhaps a little unfair for the bridesmaid to put you in the middle of this if I am honest, though what she did was really lovely so she must be a good friend to you.<br>  <br>  This is really down to them - conflicts about your shower should not be left on you to shoulder and fix.  <br>  <br>  You can either ask your MOH and ask her to buck her ideas up a bit and risk confrontation.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Tell your bridesmaid that you don't feel comfortable and would rather stay out of it.<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  Have FH ask your MOH to pay your bridesmaid.<br>  <br>  I really would stay out of it as it'll end up causing you hurt too - and this is a joyous time for you!<br>  <br>  Hope it solves itself hun x|`|kJX632msaa	You shouldn't have to be involved with finances regarding your bridal shower AT ALL.  <br>  Some people aren't cut out to be bridesmaids.  Or maybe she's having problems in her life (like financial ones) and is too embarrased to say anything.<br>  Just curious though, no offence meant: why is your bridal shower a wedding present?  Isn't that part of the responsibilities or your bridesmaids?|`|fpOzMCNNaa	Personally? I would choose that bridesmaid to be my MOH. She took the responsibility upon herself and the one you've chosen seems to be just giving you stress. Of course, that might not be possible in your situation... but that's what I would do. Your wedding day should be happy and comfortable for you. Hopefully you don't have any other drama issues coming up (though unlikely, sorry... I understand). Of course, doing that wouldn't help with the money. If your fiance is willing, though, then maybe that's the best way to go.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	1- if the girl isn't comfortable discussing money with the MOH, how did they come to this agreement in the first place?<br>  2- don't get involved, it's between them, not you.  now you know too much about how much they spent on your party, they shouldn't have brought you into it.<br>  3- do NOT pay for it yourself.  <br>  4- why did you pick such a drama queen for MOH?  you need someone who can organize, get along with everyone, roll with the punches, find quick solutions, etc.  the MOH should have hosted the shower, along with all the bridesmaids.  and that doesn't take the place of their wedding gift to you, sorry to say.  that's a cop out.  girls, if you can't afford a shower gift, wedding gift, shoes, hair, makeup, 3 figure dress, chipping in for the shower and bachelorette, travel, hotel, etc, don't agree to be in someone's wedding.  I  know I've spent $1000+ on friend's weddings and it was worth it but I wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't afford it in the first place.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	First off, kudos to your bridesmaid who is taking on the role of a maid of honor!!<br>  <br>  As for your "actual" MOH, your BM should keep insisting on the money and leave you out of it.. I know your BM is probably frustrated with this and is asking you for help, but you already have enough stress on your hands....  <br>  <br>  If you talk to your MOH, you can say that she needs to pay your BM, but that might end up causing some bickering and frustration....<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be thrown in the middle of it.  Your MOH is being immature and not doing what is right...  That's HER problem, not yours...  :(|`|AA11380378	That's her bussiness and her gig. Do not get involved. The arrangement was between the two of them, so stay out of it as you have nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I was in the bridesmaid situation a while back. The MOH was crappy.<br>  Just so you know I never got my money but it is also not your problem to collect either. They need to discuss this themselves.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	What you don't want to do is create major drama this close to your wedding day.  If your MOH is as volatile as you say about perceived personal attacks and such, she could really create some problems for you if she feels like you and the bridesmaid are ganging up on her.  I would also like to point out that it is the responsibility of whoever threw the shower to make sure all members of the bridal party have contributed financially BEFORE throwing the shower.  I know your bridesmaid had nothing but good intentions, but she never should have thrown such an elaborate shower without talking over the final costs with the MOH, if she was expecting her to chip in.  And now she is wrong to be putting you in such an awkward position by asking YOU to ask the MOH for the remaining cash.  That is extremely bad form, to involve the guest of honor in the embarrassing matter of the money used to throw the party, because now she's sort of making you feel bad for having such a nice shower if she couldn't fully afford it, right?  Personally I think you're mad at the wrong bridesmaid.  The one who threw the shower is not only a total cheapskate (for making it clear to you that she expects reimbursement from the MOH right after she got done saying it was her "gift" to you) but she is also extremely rude (for even suggesting that you be the one to ask for money from the MOH)- it is always a hostess's responsibility to worry about the money side of things, and a good hostess NEVER gets her guest of honor involved in the matter.  If your bridesmaid wants the money so bad, tell her to get on the phone with the MOH herself!|`|AA10975867	I read your question a few times before responding and offer the following observations: your bridesmaid told you that throwing the shower was her wedding gift to you. First of all, that is CRAP. The MOH or bridesmaids or just galpals throw the shower "just because". That is NOT a wedding gift. Second, if she was tacky enough to tell you that acting as a hostess for your shower was HER wedding gift, I have no doubts whatsoever that she told all the guests the same thing. How do you think the MOH felt if she was sitting next to people who were saying "Isn't Sara wonderful for throwing this party? Did you know she's paying for it all as her gift?"  In that case, your MOH has every right to leave and then feel no obligation to send money. A bridal shower is planned by the MOH AND the bridesmaids. They agree to the total costs and the, once they ALL agree on the expenses, they share the costs. If I was told by a bridesmaid that she wanted to toss the shower, do all the planning, chalk up all the expenses without input, and that this was her wedding gift to the bride - sorry, but I wouldn't send money either. This is an issue between your MOH and your very strange bridesmaid. Neither should be discussing it with you. If you really think about it, the MOH isn't causing you the stress. the bridesmaid is. She created the problem and it is up to her to solve it. Do not send a cheque! Would you pay for your own wedding gift? It really sounds like the bridesmaid wanted all the thanks and glory and control and perhaps spent more than she could afford. Now she wants some help. Very inappropriate for her to involve you.Back away from the whole mess. I would bet the house that your MOH brings you a wonderful wedding gift that she paid for herself.

AA11496527	Shortly after my wife and I were married her daughter died, she was a beautiful 28 year old that was the pulse of her family. I became a Dad to her instantly and miss her dearly but not as much as her Mother does. My wife has mourned for over 5 years and continues.<br>  <br>  Usually I am the sole person who sees her grief, it is my job to ease her pain, but over the years I have learned that my wisdom and rhetoric are not what my wife always needs or wants. I have learned that besides the birthdays, Christmas, holidays and other family events (some non family event) that the grief can erupt like a volcano and leave just as quick. It took me awhile to learn that during most of these times all my beloved wants, is a shoulder and a hug to help her through her moment. I suspect the mourning will never leave and maybe that's good, as we should never lose site of the good thing in our lives that went away. Gone but not forgotten was never so true as in the death of a child.<br>  <br>  This poem was written by Samantha Kennedy, <br>  I thought you all might like it:<br>  <br>  I sit and stare amazed to spy a <br>  thousand graves that catch my eye<br>  between the birth and death a brand<br>  I trace the dash , examine my hand,<br>  how could something so small represent<br>  an entire life in one single dent.<br>  not important when your born or die <br>  it's that single line that makes me sigh <br>  our dash is being lived this day<br>  while a thousand lines have no more to say;|`|h6M6v58jaa	My twin boys would be 24.

Maybe you can go on but at least you will know what he is thinking.  If you are not able to forget about the fight or what happened then the next time you see him you should appear to a very strong person and speak to him like you would anyone else. then smile at him making a little eye contact. then walk away...this will leave him wondering about you..<br>      most importantly if it was physical...YOU DONT OWE HIM A THING...KEEP ON GOING.|`|kjJGSSOnaa	Maybe you should step up and go talk to him.

aDhZIhQcaa	There are laws that protect fathers from this very thing.  Always check your states laws.  The public library has an entire section of law references that even lawyers use.  <br>  There is a law called "denial of affection".  I have seen women lose custody of their child due to this very law.  If he is supporting his child, he has the right to see that child.  His ex is violating his civil and parental right to have and maintain an important relationship with his child.  And that IS against the law.  He can always file suit against her based on that.  The court could have him pay child support to an account that will be held until she complies with visitation orders.  Does he even have visitation orders??|`|Qv51RS7Naa	At the moment, no there isn't anything he can do. However, he needs to write down everytime he tries to make contact and is denied. He also needs to keep his phone records showing these calls, then when it goes to court he will have a leg to stand on. Tell him to continue the support payments and this will just make him look better in front of the judge. If he hasn't already, he needs to file for custody(at least joint) and visitation rights. The courts can issue a temporary visitation order until the case goes to court. Good luck.|`|6cm6MB66aa	He needs to take it to court and you need to stay out of it . Legally there still married and your coming in between them . Not right .|`|I3PdIX0Kaa	Stop paying child support.  I bet she'll call HIM.|`|VmKzEwceaa	Go to court and get custody!!!|`|ZzjUHawhaa	take her *** to court!!!|`|Z6CJApzJaa	Well that is a tricky situation. Trust me I know my husband and I are going through the same thing with his son. In the divorce he should have included his demands. Some states make them go through mediation to figure out what is going to happen. It is kind of strange Child support has not been ordered. I would suggest he goes through the court and establishes paternity through the court then they will direct him to the child support agency and then he will have court documented papers showing he is paying child support. In our case he has no visitation or custody established in court however neither does she so really if she lets him get his son then he can. It's a horrible situation to be in. Getting an attorney is best. When we spoke with base legal they told us our best route would be to get an attorney because they can't represent us. Also they said sole custody most likely would not happen because my husband is in the marines (unstable) and we move around blah blah. Basically she has to be proved unfit and in some states that is close to impossible. I hope I helped.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He needs to file for joint custody and visitation/access.  Once an order is in place by the courts, she can be found in contempt of court if she denies him access to his child.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Hire an attorney. In the mean time STOP the support and put the money in a savings account till you can get to court and tell the Judge everything. Then he will or can order support and you will still have the money to pay her. I bet if you stop the support money coming in you will hear from her pretty quick. How does he know where to send the money if he is not ordered? If she never takes it to court to get support then by the time the child is of age he will have a good sum of money to start life with.|`|f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	My brothers wife left him and took his daughter and broke his heart and as she got older she snuck around and called him.<br>  Then she turned into a teenager  and gave her mother a bunch of trouble so she called him and asked if he would take her.<br>  Trust me when the child becomes a teenager the mother starts looking for the dad to dump the child on him.|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	Take it to court right away, and keep the DNA results at hand if needed. The next step would be to talk to a lawyer and get informed as to what his rights are, and the best option to take.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Get a lawyer.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Well he can hire a lawyer and take the DNA results to the court and ask for visitation but then they are going to look at his checks and make sure he is paying enough child support. He should make sure he doesn't send her cash or give her cash. Make it a money order or checks so that he has a paper trail to prove he is paying child support without a order to do so. It will make him look better in court and they will probably rule in his favor for the visitation. He will probably get every other weekend with the child. Its a long and hard battle but for a child that shouldn't matter. Also its can be expensive so I would make sure to save some money for the lawyers.
4vLt3SqFaa	Bad people skill probably no - some self doubt - yeah probably fits judging from your questions.  That isn't always a bad thing - often an indication of someone who tends to think a little deeper.  <br>  <br>  As far as friends go.  There are all types.  I used to think you could stay friends with your friends forever - not anymore.  Some are friends for a season, some for  certain periods in life, some because fo shared interest but that will end with the interest fades in one of you.  Only rarely do you really keep friends for life.  I have life long acquaintances who I am friendly with but only a few life long friends who I would consider close. Even the closest of friends often fade with changes of location of circumstances.

Reward him generously for his choices to be with you and for his refraining from acting on his very-much-hard-wired urges.<br>  Remember that the high level of physical energy he has is an important contribution to your relationship.

And if in fact you know him and vice a versa than he should be able to come out and tell you weather or not his reply to you is in fact truthful or false and if it is going to cause issues with you...I was in a relationship with a man who claimed he does not cather to such fantasies..He would lose his mind if any male member would look my way even a family member.  To make a very long story short I did discover very early in our relationship that he was and still is present day and time a liar, cheater, cheats back and forth with exes, addicted to the internet be it on-line dating, porno etc etc.  Cheat and uses ALL his family and friends..I met female so call friends of his that were married at the time that he even f**k them too.  By far my dear am I making any of this up for the evidence is on here on the net..I have all the emails sent to me by bit****, hackers too.  I have the photos, recording etc etc etc..Need I say any more.<br>  <br>  Speak to your partner..Yeah I did this too over and over again throughout 7 yrs..with my ex and so have the others and still are he is quite good in manipulating and brain washing you.  My ex has a mental problem yours may not unless you put it out there and ask.  Everytime we engaged in sex I felt that he would think of them and I knew he was..I would gag and throw up all over him...I am now giving him and them a taste of their own medicine..For he is doing the same to his latest victim or victims?? Good luck to you
FsmcCXlvaa	There needs to be an agreement about getting drunk in mixed company. It's fine to hang out with his friends but when there are ladies around and he's drinking it sounds like there is a problem. Maybe he needs to limit the alcohol or change the guest list. If he values the relationship he has with you then he has to admit that what he did was inappropriate and actually take steps to prevent anything like that from happening again. Some people get a little to flirty when they've had to much to drink and I think it's time he made some choices about what's more important. Alcohol and girls don't mix for some men and I think your boyfriend needs to grow up a little and change his behavior.|`|RgINbeNFaa	yeah you have merit in feeling uneasy, especially since he is so blatant with in front of you.  The guy "friend" is on some ***** ****.  don't pay him any mind because he is just going to use that to pretend to care and then you will be no different than your dude.  obviously the drinking is going to be a problem|`|B7kPUmUWaa	I'm not sure I could say anything positive about that. I would have come unglued if I saw my husband trying to unhook some girls bra. But, if you are willing to forgive him, then you have to let it go. Ask him about it. Ask why. But in the end, if you accept it and forgive him, you have to let it go.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	You saw this man unhook or try to unhook this broad's bra.<br>  <br>  That is all the information you need.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I don't know. I know that personally if it was me in the situation, I would have grilled my bf for hours about it and lectured him, and I would have been upset. I probably would have forgiven it though, since it was a first time offense and he was pretty drunk. Just tell your bf how you feel. Just in the future ,be careful and make sure your bf doesn't do something like that again. good luck.|`|aErUKUvVaa	If ur just bf/gf and there's no commitment, then there's nothin to be worried about.  alcohol, men, and "other women" mix well together, but for u it didnt. u should have either helped him get her bra off, or done something to "trump" her play on him. make sure U are the one i front of his face that he wants to play with and he will alwayslook (thats a part of being male) but if u play ur cards right and often with him, U will be the one he wants to be with.|`|lAQG15kdaa	This would be tough for me and i would be REALLY pissed off and no i wouldn't get over it fast either, there's a reason why he did it and being drunk isn't an excuse in my book. So when you aren't in the ''mood'' he goes and finds the next thing that is. I dont know- listen to you gut, if you think there's something going on your probably right, my gut never fails me when Ive had problems like this. Hopefully this will be the last time he slips up! and yes i would still be with him too- but if it keeps happening you know the deal.<br>  <br>  gooood luck and him saying you flirted with another guy is his guilty conscious trying to flip it on you.|`|mrF6N9fiaa	Regardless of if he was mad you were not in the mood or anything, he should not have been touching any other girl but you! You are his girl and only you. You should really tell him that seeing him do these things in front of you has you worried and feeling unsure. He should understand that and hopefully let you know things like that won't ever happen again. It will weigh heavy on your heart until you say something to him so I hope you would go ahead and do that now. Regardless of the alcohol, there is no excuse for that kind of behavior. How are you supposed to trust him when he goes out without you or you're not around and drinks? Makes you wonder, I know. Sit him down and talk. Let him know you aren't trying to be mad you just feel hurt. Hopefully he will understand and reassure you that he only has eyes for you. Good luck!|`|eeCoeMZsaa	ok your willing to forgive and move on <br>  <br>  but as for his friend or should i say so-called friend he's the one that you should be watching out for (that is hater mentality) and he is up to no good. ask yourself would one of your friends tell on you and if so what is in it for them|`|5brlJBGRaa	Im just gonna say its very disrespectfull to you what he did, and me as a person I have to have a guy that will respect me no matter what. good luck on ur relationship.|`|BmDPJO8Faa	be as a good boy think about god,these guys r bad, join with good guys otherwise you will be ? think ur mom & dad they r believing u . dont cheat them.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	So, how many other "slip ups" are you going to allow as long as alcohol is involved?<br>  <br>  Some females NEVER learn!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	You should have said something right then. To let him and her both know that you seen what happend. He needs to also end his 'friendhsip' with her as well. Sure he can have females friends, but they shouldn't be ones that he's had feelings for or has done anything sexual with.|`|AA10986891	Let it go, if you keep remembering the past it will keep coming up. Focus on the present and just let it go.<br>  <br>  I never thought I say this but Valerie X is kind of right, ughhhh that made me sick.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Personally i would not want a b/f that puts his hands on another girls leg or trys to undo her bra. I'm guessing since you stayed with him that you find it acceptable. Wonder what he does when you are not there!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	You don't want to hear my advice so I will save it.  But his friend saying "he is this way with all the girls" is a red flag to me.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	This is not a great relationship. I don't care how drunk you are, unless you pass out, you know what you're doing. <br>  <br>  You saw with your own eyes he had his hand on another girl's leg and he was trying to unhook her bra. WTF? If I saw this, I would end things that night. I wouldn't necessarily believe his friend, since it sounds like there are sour grapes over this girl, but I would definitely end things. HIm accusing you of "flirting" with his friend was just him projecting what he did on to you. But if your idea of a "great relationship" is one where a guy can't even control himself around other girls IN FRONT OF YOU, then it sounds like you've found a real winner.
8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Based on how you formatted your question, I must presume that this woman did not tell her husband about the "get togethers" before they got married.  So, if I were the husband in that situation I would be upset.  I don't think it would ruin my marriage, but I would start questioning everything she said to me.|`|xQJjTuEWaa	Yes I think that would be really weird and uncomfortable and should have been settled before you two got married.|`|fGLHYL0yaa	YES< YES>YES|`|y9CgveCGaa	Yes, my brother and I never dated each others former girlfriends.  It didn't seem right.|`|H16G04aeaa	Wow!  Thats a tough one.  I think that you would really need to look at your relationship and think about how he would handle this.  The fact of the matter is you should have been upfront with him when things got serious between the two of you.  I am a believer that you should tell the truth and I don't think you would be asking this question if you didn't want to tell him.  Do you still have feelings for the brother???  I think you need to ask yourself if you can live with yourself without telling him?  But I think if you were in his shoes you would want to know.<br>  <br>  Look hard at yourself and your relationship, if its strong enough you two will come out togather.  Remember the only thing you have is your word.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	Yes and Yes and Yes|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Yes I would dump her|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No I don't think so.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	I'm a woman but if it were the other way around HELL YES IT WOULD MATTER!!

Reality sets in... Maybe he was seeing someone else or found someone else in the meantime.<br>  <br>  How did you all meet?<br>  <br>  And maybe he didn't have an emotional attachment he wasn't feeling you at all. You may have been loving him but obviously he felt different. What were you all phone conversations like? When did he call?

You will find someone better!|`|94lEV2VKaa	looks like he left it till he found something better.. I bet he ends up the same with his new relationship.. what exactly did he want...|`|nD752O4Qaa	If he's your ex why do you care?

If he is your ex, what do you care? care about your current man!|`|IHH6N7j3aa	um we didnt have no connection double negative that makes a positive which means you did have a connection|`|jd4MzIYtaa	he doesnt want to be mean but he felt that wherever you were in your relationship was the best it was going to get and didnt want to pursue it any longer. After 9 months you have a general idea of who the person you are dating is and if you see a future together. I am sure he still cares about you but he doesnt care about you in the sense of a relationship. There is no need to push him back into it because you will only be fooling yourself. The feeling just isnt there for him, sometimes it has to be that way. I am sorry but you will find someone who makes you crazy and who is crazy about you, this one just wasnt it!|`|rz4sjxWBaa	well u guys only spilt up last night he could just b hurting so hes telling u that u guys had no connection not only trying to convince u but probably more himself so he can get over u <br>  dont think anything of it cuz u two obviously did have a connection considering how long u guys wnt out<br>  but unless u still have feelings for him just get over it|`|8o1ZdCkuaa	I don't understand your question.  If you could write it in a grammatically correct way and say what LDR means it would help people answer your question.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	he does  not want you in his life anymore<br>  he is with someone else
9FGXOIFWaa	Leave the b/f, but not for the guy at work.  You sound like you really need some alone time, to figure out what you want.  It sounds like you never really got over your b/f cheating.  Trust sometimes is like a broken vase, if it breaks, it can be put back together.  But never really is the same.  It's ok to be by yourself, you can date, see what else is out there, and go from there.  Love sucks sometimes, but makes you stronger in the end....|`|aDIPIu7xaa	I agree with Kari.<br>  <br>  Dump the cheater.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Leave your boyfriend.  You should have left him 3 years ago when he was cheating on you.  I can bet that he is still cheating on you.  Go be happy.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	I think you should leave your current boyfriend, not because of the fact that he cheated on you, but because he is cruel to you.  I would suggest that you handle it gently so that you do not make him very angry and he hurts you.  I would also suggest that you talk to the other guy and make sure that he has feelings for you.  Good Luck|`|MYU46ap5aa	I think you should leave him.  He's no good for you and doesn't respect you.  <br>  <br>  He's trying to keep you stuck by verbally abusing you.  Just go before it gets worse.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its time to go sorry love ... but you dont have to be with him so go and enjoy your life ..good luck with the new guy ..|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	I think you feel guilty because you gave him a chance and now you are thinking about someone else, and if this person hadn't come along, maybe you would still be trying to work it out.<br>  <br>  But the important thing is you are not happy, and neither is he since he is looking elsewhere and treating you badly. Love should bring out the best in you, and when it doesn't, then the relationship may not be the healthiest one.|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Dump him.|`|xCK70761aa	honey, if you are not happy, you are wasting your time, forget his time, your more important. Its better to separate than to just stay together and rip yourself apart wondering if he gonna do the same again. Yuo can always forgive but never forget. You guys are meant for each other you will reunite when the time is right. Me and now my husband were in an emotional rollercoaster when we wre first together. We loved each other til it hurt but wanted to make each other suffer if that can make sense to you. We broke up. I cut communication and had no contact for two years. then we somehow got reunited and gave it anothe rchance with no expectations. We matured, we grew up and changed for the better separatelyso when we got back together we knew it was not gonna be the 1st time around. After a year we got married. Remember if you let him go, and you two are meant for each other, when the timing is right, he will come back to you somehow.

This is a serious issue where the two of you don't have the same goals and are going in different directions in life, and as much as you guys love each other if there isn't an agreement on this issue its going to put a constant strain on the relationship and at some point somethings gonna give with repercussions neither of you want. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately there is no way of getting around this except dealing with it head on. Talk to him and explain how badly you want a child, which I'm sure you've done in the past. Basically you need to decide whether its worth it to deny yourself something this important in life to you for the sake of being in a relationshp with the man you love even if it may lead to years of regret down the road. As you've already realized, you are the only person you can guatrantee will be there for you for the rest of your life. Don't worry about being selfish because to a certain extent your boyfriend is also being selfish by denying you something that is obviously critically important to you.

VkzmH1GKaa	Get an atorney, if you can't afford one seek out your local legal aide office.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Mediation is a way for the two of you to hash out the divorce details without having to go through litigation that could take months/years...it helps speed up the divorce process.

Be yourself, be in control - be well!|`|2sF0qPjBaa	Mediation is a lot more affordable then actually going to court. Go there with an open mind and be willing to compromise on issues. Your attorney will handle everything (and you will be in a separate room from your husband). They can take awhile but if both of you are tight on money and do not want to go to court and pay those fees then mediation is good. You will most likely have to split the cost 50/50 by paying your attorney and paying the mediator.|`|4eLLjTzzaa	A mediator might be described as a translator.  They serve the purpose of a pressure gauge during conversation to help both parties hear one another better.  For instance, wife says, "We never go anywhere", by which she means she misses interacting with other people and doing something unrelated to housework and children.  Husband hears "You're boring and lazy and I don't find you interesting any more".  So, the mediator tries to act as a neutral party to help Wife and Husband hear what they're really trying to communicate.  <br>  <br>  A common problem in communication between people is we are talking AT one another instead of TO one another.  I intend to say I'm lonely and want to talk to a grown up but my partner hears me accuse him of neglecting me and never being satisfied with his performance.  We desperately need someone to translate and take the pressure off.
sPUOcQ21aa	well im 16 year old girl and well to be honest yes! my whole like my best friends were always guy. heck my best friend right now is a guy. and i love him to death. and idk why i've never been attracted to him but i guess it's like this, you just feel that way. and thats the only way i can expain it. i tell him everything about personally problems to bf problems and like he is very understanding and he is not gay. but to be honesst shopping with a guy friend is so much fun cuz you know what guys think is not hot. and what guys like!!|`|YWe5fYAhaa	I'd like to say yes it is possible but in my experience whenever members of different sexes are 'best friends' then usually there is something going on at least from one side...I hope I'm wrong though. <br>  <br>  I don't mean just having friends of the opposite sex though, I've got plenty, I just mean when people get overly close like spending all their free time together, it does make you wonder and from what I've seen that's usually an indication that there could be more than friendship in it at least from one side. x|`|14gytfMLaa	Its not possible or natural for a real bloke to be in a "best girlfriend" type relationship with girl. C'mon that's for screaming gay lovey types. Anyone telling you different is trying to be p.c or is a liar.<br>  <br>  Aquaintence maybe. Its not how men are wired. Which women would'nt want to be desired,wooed and loved.|`|WPlEOkE5aa	exactly the same as you.<br>  he does like me though " in that way"<br>  but i spose i do a bit, but i love him to pieces a friend hu i spend alot of time with.<br>  i definitely wouldnt go there ... if you get me. <br>  <br>  so yeh i do :D<br>  but it normally ends up with one liking the other.<br>  on movies anyways.|`|1fYbbjO2aa	One of my best friends is a boy and I'm not "attracted" to him at all... Not coz hes a minger or any thing.<br>  Most girls get on with boys better then girls at your age as there less b!tchy. <br>  <br>  (:|`|QIYHApEkaa	Absolutely! One of my best friends is a woman whom I've known for over 20 years! And there has NEVER been anything sexual between us|`|BjyXKFpRaa	yes it can happen.|`|d02gJC1aaa	fine until u do get a bf.  then the trouble will start.|`|ws4c4GDgaa	I think its normal to be friends with someone of the oppisite sex i have many guy friends that im not interested in but still enjoy being around them and talking with them. I think guys are way less jugemental than girls and thrs way less drama with guys that thr are girls. Some people do ask if im going out with him or like him it happens to me all the time but i just dont pay any attention to them and go on with what im doing.|`|l7E3EreXaa	It depends on how mature each person is. My best friend is a lady and she is better than any male friend I have ever had in my life. We talk for hours, hang out, and act goofy without any sexual tension going on. Its fine to be attracted to someone. Its not as if you have to act on it. Plus, you're 15. Dont worry about dating or anything just yet. Boys these days are terrible.|`|BCNsuqgRaa	Even though its rarely seen, it is possible to be friends with the opposite sex without any attraction. You may want to ask her though, before jumping to conclusions, because even if she doesn't show it she may like him more then just a friend.|`|isrszWd3aa	YESS! My best friends are boys actually. We all grew up together. Boys aren't as mean as girls become to be at your age. I have had the same guy friends for 18 years now and my "girl friends" have faded away. Stick with the guy friends they will always be there for you!|`|eO0iByzMaa	It is definitely possible, one of my best friends is male and i have never felt 'attracted' to him in any way apart from a friendship way but i can understand why some people find it strange.|`|KNBTViNNaa	Yeah, you can be but in most cases it will eventually go beyond just friends. They might not have any attraction now, but it could grow into a relationship at any time.|`|S4eb7QiJaa	Sure.  Sometimes sexual feelings get in the way, but lots of guys and girls are good friends.|`|J9jb56L2aa	hells yea im a dude and the best friend is a girl just be yourself and if it works it works|`|njz5XFG2aa	i'm 14 year old girl and just about all my friends r guys so i see no problem.|`|FikbiEzCaa	yes..i've lots of guy friends and we're only friend!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	For some people yeah.<br>  Me, I couldn't do it with most guys, because I hang out with them a few times, and I can't help but flirt and than I start liking the guy. Sometimes I'm sick of it cuz I like people I really shouldn't...like right now. <br>  <br>  Its possible, but unlikely for some girls.|`|oIFMohfUaa	It can happen.  Only they know...or will know.  <br>  <br>  Don't judge.  I was friends with boys forever, and still have many male friends.  I am IN LOVE with my husband of 26 years.  TOTALLY different!|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	i think it is very possible, i have a lad who i always speak to, he's like my best lad friend tbh, i get along with him better than girls sometimes, so yeah it's not weird cause you don't have to feel attracted to him ?|`|VSpqYAabaa	Very possible.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	clearly if there is no physical attraction then sure, why not?  <br>  <br>  who makes up these freeken rules anyway?  guys?|`|qIILwjsraa	I had a best friend that was a boy. instead of boyfriends i call them friendboys.
PpGCchNPaa	It`s a sexual thing he will probably start choking u out during sex soon enough.<br>  I`m serious.|`|VEi3R0craa	Thank God I have never been in a physically abusive relationship but I believe I have not because I watch for signs and end relationships when I think it is going to end up there.  This may be a sign that he may get abusive one day.  I believe a man gives signs informing women they are abusers and for what ever reason a women refuses to see them.  You may have to look into it more but he may be one.  Because you are contradicting yourself he only does it when I say something he doesn't like but he is joking.  Because when my husband does or says something I don't like I one don't joke about it because he won't think I am serious and two I don't put my hands on him I tell him how I feel and ask him to figure away not to do it again.  Sounds like you guys are young|`|lfDDdq4Gaa	idk maybe he has problems.. i thought you meant grabbing you so he can kiss you. it sounds like he wants 2 be the boss && in the long run that might lead 2 abuse of some sort could be physical or emotional. just watch out.|`|1JVAZbt7aa	all guys do that.<br>  its like programmed into them.<br>  even thou they know girls hate it.|`|Pwg8IUbTaa	Oh !

This is the concluding portion of her rendition of its theme song; which if I recall correctly was composed by a member of the Firestone family, whose name I'm unable to recall; but it would be perfect for the father and daughter to dance to - its entitled "If I could tell you":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZzhR24ipE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZzhR24i...</a><br>  <br>                                                   Alberich|`|fc1n9vBjaa	"If a daddy ever loved a daughter as much as I love you" by simon and garfunkel|`|QsVMeaPXaa	do they all have to be religion based?

But more than any thing do what you think is best for you. Not for him or any one else!  I hope it works out for you!
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	It is a bit early (usually you send invites 6-8 weeks ahead), but I think your reason makes sense so I would mail them before the postage increase takes place.<br>  <br>  You could always use the excuse that you wanted to let everyone know well in advance so they don't plan a summer vacation around the weekend of your wedding.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	They should be sent out at least 8 weeks ahead.  My wedding planner is having me get mine out 10 weeks ahead.  Your RSVP date should be 3-4 weeks out so that you can follow up with non-responders and get the final guest number to the venues and caterer.  I think you'll be fine if you want to send them out before the pay increase.  Just make sure that proper postage is on the return RSVP envelopes if you have them.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Don't send them any earlier than 8 weeks in advance- so inyour case, that would be June 6.  Any earlier than that and your guests will misplace them or forget about them altogether, and you won't get your RSVPs back.  I think it would be worth it to you to just add on some extra postage, which by the way, will be an extra 2 cents.  Stamp prices are going up to 44 cents.|`|q7NrlanJaa	Wow didn't even know you could get stamps made with a pic, sounds too expensive for my budget!  Keeping that in mind, I would say send them in May, it will just look better and of course save your some dough!  As for the reply card stamps, I just had everyone RSVP at my wedding website or call, but my wedding is small.  You could always use regular stamps for the reply cards.|`|Sjf112pKaa	Send out save the date announcements in May but dont send out the actual invites until about 3 weeks before the big day.|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Send them 6-8 weeks before the wedding. but i would send them out on june 1st. that will be 8 weeks ahead of time and if not try june 8th.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	No because you want people to know in time to plan their vacations around it. You don't want to wait too long.|`|bQCfOftxaa	i think 6-8 weeks is appropriate.|`|Y7hDrOEGaa	I think it is a little early, but it will probably be fine.  It will definitely give people a heads up! <br>  <br>  Send them out, its your wedding, do what makes you happy!!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Do they have "Forever Stamps" available for the photo?  That would be your best bet.<br>  <br>  But, in all honesty, you are looking at about 3 months...  I'd say that's fine.  Make your RSVP in July, and then it wouldn't look so bad.  It gives them 2 months to RSVP, and you 3 months to finalize your guest list.  :)<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD:  Did you get stamps for the RSVPs?  Because, if postage goes up the day after you send them out, you won't receive any of your RSVPs back... :(<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it's proper to pay for the stamps on the RSVP returns, but I was told you were to... So, I am unsure hehe|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!<br>  <br>  YES, unfortunately, I do think that is too early.  That is about 12 weeks before the wedding.  Normally, you mail invites out 8 weeks before the wedding, so for you, that would be about June 6 or so.  So, yes, I do think you should hold off.  Also, when people receive an invitation so early, then tend to put it aside...so there goes getting your RSVP's back in a timely manner.|`|sGP6s7uraa	6-8 weeks is ideal. Postage changes May 11, 2009.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Two months is the max. Usually it's six weeks.|`|AA11327039	If you have a current phone number for everyone on your invite list, then I say to go ahead and send the invites out.  The photo stamp is special and adding extra postage takes away from that and not being able to use it for the actual invitation would be heartbreaking.<br>  <br>  What I would do is send out the invites and wait for the RSVP's to come back.  Then when it's about a 2-3 weeks before the actual date, I would give a personal phone call to everyone who RSVP'd.  Just to check in and see if they need directions to the church or the reception cite. (Really a nice way of saying "You haven't forgotten about my big day have you?!"|`|R7b150Iyaa	Too early, ideal timeframe is 6-8 weeks before the wedding.  That way, people feel obliged to RSVP right away and won't put your invite aside or forget.  Sorry, looks like you're gonna have to buy those extra stamps...<br>  I feel your pain about the postage rates going up....I bought these awesome disney stamps (a whole bunch!) to send out thank you notes after the wedding.  Our wedding is April 17th, 2009 but we won't be back from our 2 week honeymoon until May 5th, and I doubt I'll have time to write all the thank you notes and send them before May 11th.<br>  Oh, and I think stamps are going up by 2c each, not 1c.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!<br>  <br>  EDIT: PS, Panther is wrong!  You can't send out invites 3 weeks before, most places make you give a final headcount about 3-4 weeks before the wedding.  Go with 2 months.

8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	You will never reach a point in your life where your mother, at least to some extent, stops treating you like a kid.  You are indeed her child and you always will be no matter how old you are.<br>  <br>  I am a 40 year old man with two children from a previous marriage and a fiance.  My mother still treats me like a child at times.  Sigh!<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is hard for that parent to break out of old ways in dealing with you...you know...those old ways that they used to deal with you when you were much smaller?<br>  <br>  However; I would politely stand up to your mother.  Don't get into an arguing match because that is pointless.  But always be willing to listen to her perspective with a grain of salt.  Just because you are not always doing things the way she did with you and/or in the way that she thinks it should be done does not make you wrong.  With so many issues in life there is no right or wrong, just different approaches.<br>  <br>  In the end, you are the one who must make the decisions, in particular, where you and your family are concerned.  Do not be afraid to let her know that you are in charge.<br>  <br>  Does she make you feel like you are wrong in front of your husband and kids?  If she does, I would not put up with that.<br>  <br>  All in all, if she does not change then just don't visit her as much any more.  Maybe don't share so much with her if you know that this is the type of reaction she is going to provide?  Perhaps she'll eventually take the hint?  Parents have to be parents but not in such a way that they alienate their children.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11501437	it is just the way it is.  my mom is the same way...and her mom is the same way to her.  god forbid we do it to our kids...<br>  <br>  my mom thinks she and i are close...i let her into the parts of my life that are acceptable to her...and nothing else.  she does the same with her mom. We love eachother so much, and its a vicious cycle, but at this point, there is no changing anyone.  i know what parts of my life and decisions she can and cannot deal with, therefore she is only a part of what she thinks is ok with me.  sucks, but we make it work.  I know she would kill for me...and i for her...but really, we are just close on the surface...so...i have alot of great female friends rather than being deep 'friends' with my mom.  good luck!|`|PyRxe9B2aa	First of all, you are spending too much time with your mother. She knows too much about your life ( I bet you are the one telling her.) <br>  do not argue with her because that's what she wants. When she tells you what to do, thank her and say "I may try that" When she tells you that you are wrong say "Thank you for sharing"  She will get so sick of hearing those words she will not want to tell you what to do any more. It is the argument that she likes. Every time she brings up something about you CHANGE the subject. Her life must be very boring and that's why she is into your life. Stop taking it personal, the reason she has no friends of her own is because she pulls this crap on everybody and she has no life other than annoying other people and that includes you.  Your life is just fine and she is probably jealous. Good luck
9W48OvAraa	Dude-this is an easy one!<br>  Ask her-your best bet is when no one else is around so you may both speak freely (as possible).<br>  If you like her, tell her.<br>  It really is just that simple bro!<br>  BC|`|AA11441704	if she finds a reason to call your name...........so many times.........

3o7ULYoLaa	It sounds to me like she is jealous that you are keeping the fallen pieces of your life together.<br>  And making good with the situations that you have been thru.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on what you have to do and dont worry about her. Even tho it will bother you, just try to focus on your beautiful kids, and your soon to be amazing husband. They will get you thru everything!|`|7Wj0KW6Aaa	I don't think that you should scream at her because she'll just use that against you in the future, but you aren't wrong in what you're feeling. She has her own kids and you have your own, why should it matter who has more kids and who is pregnant at what time? 5 years is certainly not rushing into things so I don't know where she is getting that. I'm marrying a guy that I've been with for 3 years, is that rushing? She makes no sense!<br>  As for your son's father, maybe she is seeing it differently than you. I know you said that he is allowed around, but do you make him welcome? I don't think that you should have to tell him times that he can come see his son if he really wants to see him, but some guys are shy and don't want to cause waves. Maybe thats why he hasn't been around. I have no idea, but perhaps thats what your sister is seeing. I can't say that it seems like you're keeping your ex away, but maybe you could invite him to the park or something to see his son and if he says he's busy or if he flat out says no then you can show your sister the email and shut her up.<br>  I hope your child is healthy and that your sister backs off! Just try to keep your patience with her and keep your stress level low for the good of your child.
oR40n3kPaa	Its lame for parents to disown their own children for race reasons.  Do what you want and live your life out the way you want to.  If you are old enough to make wise decisions on your own then do so.  Over time your parents will see that your bf or by then your husband is a good guy and they will learn to accept him.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	people are titled to their on opinion so stop worrying but lets see what happen 4years from now.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	yes you are right and if this man treat you good and would make a good husband and father for your children then you will just have accept your dad as he is and move on with your life. you cant live your life trying to make someone else happy and its not even like your father just wants the best for you because in that case i could understand. But he is racist and thats ok, he can be whatever he likes but you dont have to accept him imposing his views on you. live your life and be happy.
oR40n3kPaa	Your parents do have issues, sorry to put it like that.  All you can do is respect their dumb rules and go along with things.  Show your parents that having someone give you the keys is not a big deal.  Still take your bf over and enjoy yourselves but don't give the friends or your parents the power they think they have.  If you show your parents that their dumb rules don't bother you they will soon see that they are acting silly.  You are old enough to decide for yourself and they should respect that you are wise enough to make good decisions on your own.  Go get the key from your parents friends and you and your bf have a blast.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	Now why would you think that your parents don't trust you? Your mom is on to you, girl. That's why you're getting the house key from your mom's friend! This whole scenario is because of the lie you told her. Mom is just trying to protect you and/or keep you away from your bf. They are never going to understand your relationship with him if you explained to her until your face turned purple.<br>  <br>  There are two ways you can solve this. One way, is to just ignore your mom, do whatever you want and take your bf with you, regardless of what you lied about and told her. You'll have a huge risk of getting caught by your mom's friends the whole time you are there. The entire holiday would be so stressful that you won't have a good time anyway. One other thing is that your mom may give instructions to her friends to have them call her if they see that your bf is with you and tell you to head home right away. The only thing she needs to say that would be legitimate is that the townhouse belongs to her and your dad. Can't argue with that.<br>  <br>  Another way is to tell your mom the truth. Tell her you are so sorry for lying, but you knew she would not allow your bf to go to the townhouse with you. Be sincere. Your mom is hurt by the fact you lied to her. It may take some time for her to trust you again. She may ask you to make alternate plans for your holiday because the townhouse is now off limits. And you need to realize that it was of your own doing. Your mom has every right to not let you go to the townhouse, as you deliberately lied to her. Nobody with any morals is going to disagree with your mom. Sneaking around behind her back is immature behaviour for a sophomore. You might be "in love" with your bf, but your mom is your mom your life - no matter what. It's not a matter of who's right or wrong. It's a matter of principles. I hope things go well for you, whatever you decide.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	They are wrong for judging him but they will get over it. But any just sit down and talk to them and let them know in a respectful way that you are going to be with him they will love you more once you sit down and talk to them. But be respectful know.|`|9W48OvAraa	By the way we do not choose our families but we do get to choose our friends!<br>  The neat thing is this: At your age you can choose to love anyone you want and that is cool! Your parents on the other hand do not. It is their house, not yours and you have no right to betray them when using it. Now of course you can and will do whatever you want-I understand that. But get that your parents only want what they think is best for you- I know they are closed minded but their intention is good.<br>  Again they OWN the house NOT you. SO you should indeed be expected to abide by their rules in THEIR home.<br>  If that does not make sense to you I would suggest you look into why you have an entitlement mentality. Your parents do not owe you jack-You will understand this one down the road if you raise kids-I have not but understand working around the rules as I have my whole life but when it comes to someone’s property or money cheating/lying is just that, cheating/lying.<br>  Good luck with school your relationship and your life!<br>  No go have fun!<br>  BC
0BX1yFGuaa	The white star shaped flowers are stephanotis.  They are beautiful and real.  The florist can put a pearl or rhinestone center in them to add a little bit of detail to the flower but they are very real and very nice.<br>  <br>  My bouquet was similiar.  Stephanotis (with pearl centers), roses, lisianthus, mini tulips, gerber daisies, and a bit of stock.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	ask the florist to get them for you, they'll know what's best.  just pay the florist for those extras and ask them to do it for you.  those little white star shaped flowers look fake tho, stay away from silk flowers because they are so ugly!

i48kxrbaaa	If you want to speak to him again, then call him back.
e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Keep moving forward; mature individuals even when angry do not say hurtful things to those they care about. Who cares what he had to say, are you simply looking for more of the same?|`|j8aCEtg8aa	If you're fighting before you are even in a committed relationship then don't bother trying. Forget this guy and hope you never hear from him again, unless of course you want to live a life of drama, heartache and bullsh!t.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Sounds like he DID try to contact you again and again and you ignored it.  If you weren't in a committed relationship to begin with, he's going to move on.  If you want him, call him and apologize and try to be a grown up.  Leave this 12 year old "if he REALLY LOVES me, he'll call me 32545614 times" behind.|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	Call him back and say did you call me. What could it hurt.
4nOEDc8qaa	Sounds like a toxic situation to me.  If things are really really over, there are a hundred other places he could go.  I really doubt that this guy doesn't have any friends or family that he couldn't at least stay with temporarily.  The fact that she still has feelings for her ex means that she is on the rebound and needs time.  If you really do like her, and she really likes you, is it really a big deal if you wait a few months just to make sure no one gets hurt?|`|tFbdkxyIaa	I wouldn't as i'm very suspicious and somewhat jealous, but i know many people who would and have and it's worked out. sometimes, for economic reasons, people simply can't afford to get another place as soon as they decide to split.  there is a time lag. i have a friend who actually waited some years while her partner lived with his ex as they had a very old broken relationship and were sharing the house out of convenience, economy and for the kids. then it took some time to sell the house and they couldn't afford a second housing in the mean time. <br>  many examples like that. especially if people were married for a long time or have kids.|`|04Te5gzzaa	I think it's more of the ex having feelings for her, not the other way around.  You heard it from him, not from her.  And his behavior when you're at their apartment definitely proves this point.  If he's really over her and not interested in her love life, why is he getting upset when she's on a date with you?  Honestly, it could be a case of her dating someone just to get her ex jealous...which if is the case, is working.  I would just wait until he moves out before you start dating seriously.  You don't want to get yourself into some weird love triangle.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	Hell no! If i were you, the minute she said she still had feelings for him, i'd be outta there! I don't care what either of them say, but living with your ex is just not right if you want to start a new relationship. <br>  Just my two cents :)|`|Xka2R4EJaa	Hell NO! Omg! that is WAAAAY too much baggage! get out while you can!|`|eTBfsjCUaa	No you need to wait. Juts tell her that you two need to keep things casual until he moves out.|`|yhp6Zvzaaa	HELL NO ! Wait until he moves out. <br>  <br>  && if they both still have feelings for each other that is another reason why you just shouldn't get with her at all !|`|okXvWN5haa	i think that it would b a horrible idea if u dated her while she is still living with her ex..i would wait if i were you....|`|FaDGtJF7aa	No way. You go and kiss her goodnight then she goes in and blows her ex. Better brush your teeth.|`|89HhKWuIaa	RUN AWAY NOW!! There is no way that you can still have feelings for someone, live with them and think that nothing happens when you aren't there!|`|dIw1112Zaa	Yeah you should wait until he does move out. I wouldn't feel comfortable if my bf lived with his ex.|`|WKU453Wraa	Of course not! How could you trust someone enough to accept them living with there ex.|`|AA11140814	i think you should wait as well. you don't know what REALLY goes on behind closed doors.|`|E4W6KxCMaa	Trust your instincts...stay away until he's gone and just be her friend.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well just stay with her if there not together anymore than eveything is fine|`|RikCftYKaa	why would you even ask...? No.|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I would say it is a bad idea. Especially if they still have feelings for each other and you can't be at the house because he doesn't like you. Sounds like a lot of drama that you shouldn't have to deal with. I don't think it's worth it, but I guess it depends on how much you like her and how much trust you have in her. That would drive me nuts, but if you trust her enough and know that nothing would ever happen between her and her ex then you could go for it.|`|r7iTzPdtaa	No way. Not ever.  Of course, I wouldn't date someone who wants to live together before marriage anyway.  <br>  <br>  You want a fresh new relationship and you can't have that by entangling yourself in the drama of their old relationship, which doesn't sound like it's completely over.  <br>  <br>  Sure they may "never get back together" but that doesn't mean they won't hook up from time to time.  Don't get strung along.|`|oJV3rvsRaa	no, i would not. how can you trust a girl that still has feelings for her ex and still lives with them?!<br>  <br>  they are probably still into eachother and you are jsut her rebound<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304110606AAmF4Y3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ybtJJmJHaa	Imagine having a friend asking you this same question.  You would advise against it 10 times out of 10.  It doesn't even sound like a good idea and you seem to realize that, now all you have to do is make the right decision.|`|W4xRqgbsaa	That depends ... if you just wanna have sex with her and keep things light, then why not, but since you "really like her" then this is a bad scene. Run away!<br>  <br>  She's probably using you to make him jealous.|`|cn49BbRiaa	That situation dosent sound right. I dont think that your ex and you should be living under the same roof. Thats not going to work.|`|wy9rgMGsaa	Personally, NO I couldnt do that, Sounds like if they are really broken they would be anxious to get out of the house they shared and move on with their lives|`|ZZHnOqEsaa	get out of there while you can!!!!|`|6jgjZEB2aa	You better stick to her if you like her; her ex would move out.|`|5nAnWp3daa	yup|`|ayM5TlcXaa	i think you shuld wait and then give it a try|`|gHbldb4maa	hell no!!!! dont get yourself into that!! wait till he is out!<br>  no no nooooo|`|HHyny0JSaa	Heck no I wouldn't date someone who lives with their ex. Exes still have sex. Just because they tell you one thing, it might be different that whats really going on behind closed doors. That is a bad situation waiting to happen. RUN!!!!|`|jIk2ttH1aa	DO NOT DATE HER.<br>  You are in for a heart break and a mind trip from hell if you stay with her....even when the ex's moves out of the house, he hasn't moved out of her heart-- she told you so herself.<br>  <br>  Treat yourself with respect.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Why are they living together still? Why don't one of them move in with their parents or a friend nearby or something? I don't think there could be very much trust in a relationship like that. Maybe wait until he moves out so you know they aren't fooling around or anything.|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Holy crap. I've been there, done that. Its best to date her when she's out, or he's out. Don't get mixed up in that. Wait until the coast is clear.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	uhhh youve been with this girl for how long already and now youre questioning it?  she was probably 'doing him' the entire time you were dating eh?  what's the problem with her living with him now?  sheesh!|`|oojO4WAraa	No, I would not.|`|6E81yM9Eaa	I wanna start by saying that its hard to be with someone that is still attach to her ex. thats pretty tough, only you have to make the decision. See for me i wouldnt because if my man tells me that he lives with his ex then right there i would feel uncomfortable. But like i said its how you feel because if someone am interested in tells me that he still has feeling then it tells me alot. maybe shes giving you a hint okay. this is very delicate, because it seems like you like her and your just waiting for the break through which might not happen....|`|Z6mKM1DOaa	I think what's more important is that she's told you she still has feelings for her ex.  That makes her somewhat emotionally unavailable to you.<br>  <br>  Even though the ex has told you they won't reconcile, the animosity towards you speaks of something else.  Dead dogs don't bark, as they say.<br>  <br>  Proceed with extreme caution.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	If you live in the usa, the economy is causing many to live like that.  If her ex does not like you, it is not his choice as long as he does not make any threats towards you go with how you feel.|`|uxyWNQPbaa	hahahahah **** no!<br>  <br>  Its bad enough there is still lingering feelings but then he is living with her aka seeing her every day and doesn't want you around? I say you should deal with one relationship before you jump to the next!|`|JbfKUmw0aa	If you pursue her I think you're just putting yourself in a position to get hurt.|`|cbmkx5Joaa	i would wait until he moves out, especially since she says she still has some feelings for him.|`|gKKD8Aayaa	no i would not|`|xGI9z01Maa	It depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  My ex husband and I were living in the same house for a while.  We separated in Jan but we did not want to make the children move in the middle of the school year, so we lived in the same house until June.  I started to date but I did not bring them back to the house.  That would just be cruel.  (We had separate bedrooms.)<br>  <br>  If this is a short term thing, then it is one thing but not if it is long term.  But I would not go to that house except to pick up.  You are in his pond.  It is hard to see your ex with someone new.  My new bf is not allow to do things in front of my ex like hugging and kissing.  It's respect thing.  But I have children with him and when the children have a thing, they both have to be around.  <br>  <br>  You just have to choose if this is a relationship that you want.  If it is just a thing for the night or a few week, don't do it.  But if this could end up as a long term relationship, then I would just adjust and keep out of his pond.
I1y4OF4Laa	i am sorry to hear about the things you are going threw i was in that as well a while back with my dad all i can really say is in my case i jst pray everyday every night before i went to bed cause when you are out of options it is really the only thing you can to i understand that you dont want to leave you mom and rest of the family maybe you and you aunt should get the rest of the family like all your frends and family that know what your going threw and have like a intervition with you dad and tell him that you love him but the way he is is not working he needs to find some help and reseach for anger mangement classes i know you feel like you want you dad to die but you dont want that it is just the easyes way for everything to get fix fast and even thought you may not like your dad you do love him and ii dont know how close you are with jesus but maybe it time to turn to them in you time of need he is always some one to turn to i want you to say this every time you need stenght"I can do all things through him who strengthens me.<br>  <br>  —Philippians 4:13" i hope i have help  email me back  at tapout.val8@gmail.cm if you need some one to talk to|`|6ea6d34e607603126e12379d095d0266aa	He is abusing you guys, pick up the phone and call CPS yourself - anonymously if you need to, look up the number - he needs to be reported.  He could get the help he needs such as anger management, parenting classes!  You could always tell another adult, and have them call CPS on him too if that is easier...your mom obviously isn't doing anything about it!|`|nXPJ6d7eaa	So, what your saying is, you are stuck at home with him until you are emancipated? No...<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you don't have much power at your age, and adults will exert all of their power on you to keep you under control and out of trouble. <br>  <br>  I would recommend talking to another adult. Explain exactly what you have told us, that you can't leave your family behind just to escape him. Ordinarily I would probably suggest a school counsellor, because they are ideal third parties, but in your case, I think you should call someone (at child protective services) and explain the situation, anonymously if need be, to begin with. <br>  <br>  This is emotional abuse, and you will not get out of it unscathed, regardless of whether you leave now or later. The damage can be lasting and hard to undo. CPS staff are aware of this, and will understand. Take control, and call them. <br>  <br>  Good luck...
EYt8H5N2aa	This is a tough situation to be in Evalynn. If I was in that situation I may not even tell because I would be too scared. The fact that he is a jerk will tell you that he is not going to be around very long. Imagine who all he is talking to behind your sister's back if he is basically doing it in her face. I dont want to be horrible and tell you not to tell her but I know that I may not tell her but I will end up hating him for making me feel this way and putting me in a position like this. But the guilt will eat you alive if you do not tell her. That is why I say that this is a very tough situation to be in.|`|VOZbGpbeaa	In front of your sister, snap him!|`|LOuK0Ysiaa	okay wow ...tell ur sis tht u dont like him, but dont tell her tht he kissed u ..itd break her heart ...stay away from tht guy ...keep telling ur sis tht he is a jerk ..and its not ur fault|`|668e4940f332d5a69a12f37929417c0caa	Don't tell her. Doing so would ruin so much. Avoid this guy like the plague, he is obviously a douche bag. Your actions were a mistake, that is all. If he tells her and she asks, lie. She will believe you, because if he brings it up to her there are probably some serious problems going on between them. Just be more careful these kind of choices can haunt you let this one be a one off.|`|6VhcygKsaa	you need to back away from this jerk, if he would do this to your sister then he will continue to do so.  He is a player!!!!  Don't fall into his trap and possibly ruin something that you should never cross.  Your relationship with your sister!!!!  Nothing is more important than family.. And yes you should let your sister know what the scum bag has done.  And if she chooses not to believe you then she gets what she deserves when he cheats on her.. Open your eyes!!!!  And open hers.  Maybe get a tape recording or video set up in a room where your both at and that way you would have it in black and white....  Be sneaky about it.. But don't lead him on like you want to have something with him either.  Let him make the move and bust himself.|`|GU4S78ejaa	Put yourself in your sisters position. How would you want her to handle this situation? I think you should tell her. If he's trying to mess around with you her own sister, imagine all the other girls he's trying to hook up with. Do you think she deserves that? Tell her. I'm sure she will be hurt but she has every right to be. Good luck!|`|lVIdENvqaa	Tell your sister immediately. Her boyfriend has no business playing up to you when sis is his girlfriend.<br>  Maybe she'll believe you and maybe not, but the more time she hangs out with him, the better she will understand that you are telling the truth.|`|oR40n3kPaa	So you rather keep on messing around with the guy on the side?  Expose him for who he is because it will hurt your sister more later on if she finds out you were putting out some puss and you weren't being honest.  If you tell her now before things get out of hand then it won't be as painful.  Its just a matter of time before you end up riding the guy and your sis ends up walking in on you two.  Spare your sister the damage .. tell her..|`|AA11108018	Tell him look your my sisters b/f and don't want you to put your hands on me again.

And tell him you'll "cut 'em off" if he ever tries that with you again.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	first of all your sister needs to know that she is dating a jerk if she believes you or not and your mom needs to be ashamed of herself why would you make that up to ruin your sister life but if it was me I will tell he anyway so that it want be on me when every thing blow up,cause that is the next step.|`|LHbdPdg3aa	Your sister deserves a better guy than that. So do her a favor and tell him to go f**k off. As for what happened between you and him, I suggest never being alone around him again. If he comes into your room, leave. But that situation should not happen anymore in the first place because you need to start getting angrier at this jerk for doing this to your sister behind her back. Giving in to his advances was a big mistake on your part, just show you are truly sorry by telling your sister the story. She will be angry with you for awhile, but the alternative is so much worse in my eyes. To not stick up for your sister and letting an idiot like that keep going on. If the situation was reversed, would you like nobody to do anything or not tell you?|`|lQouIoCraa	Find a boy friend and keep him around alot, especially when you know this jerk is going to be near by.  Don't make it easy for him to find you alone.  Chances are, that he is this way with other women and it is just a matter of time before your sister realizes whats going on and confronts him.  It would be better for someone else to be "the other woman", just keep your distance and make sure that he never has an opportunity to cause trouble.

Ek3O7SmBaa	Realize that the majority of things of why we fight with other people are petty. (Like 99% of the timie). Always relax and think about what you're gonna say and make sure its logical. Also understand another person's point of view and listen. This advice is for when dealing with family, friends, and coworkers.<br>  <br>  Now, patience with umm.. the government?? <br>  <br>  Absolutely not, its good being impatient because it shows you're a person of passion and not apathetic. If you're upset at injustices then stand up, and blow your f#*#ing head off.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Well, the real question is why are you short tempered and impatient lately?  Something is going on under the surface, stress or anger that needs to get out are being misdirected at people it doesn't really belong to, that's why you're worried about it.  So try to get to the root of the problem, maybe you need some time off, or maybe you need to resolve a problem that's weighing you down.... try counting to 10 before you speak, and look for ways to relax yourself like yoga or meditation....  The chances are you have run out of resources because you're not taking enough time for yourself, then everybody else starts to look like a drain....|`|XojxC4xxaa	Try to just take a moment to relax.

AA10759085	You should be honored about him calling you Mommy it means he accepts you as a mother figure. I had 4 teenagers calling me mom when I started seeing my now husband. Yes you do feel weird about it when you first hear it after all its new to you. I told my girls it was ok with me if they called me mom as long a it was ok with there real mom and dad because I did not want to make anyone feel hurt because they loved me enough to want me as a mom. So talk to your boyfriend and go from there. Age has no bearing here I was 37 and the oldest of the 4 was 17 and the youngest was 13.|`|AA10880314	This happened with my husband's little girl when he had visitation with her, when we finally got serious and moved in together. I think it is an indirect form of flattery and he is trying you on for size. He sees you as nice, fun and caring enough to be his mommy.<br>  <br>  I didn't feel comfortable with the title of "mommy" in her eyes though, only her real mother could fill that role. It would have been annoying as well to her real mom I think. We subtly encouraged her to call me by my first name and refferred to me as second mommy. It eventually caught on it was no big thing. Although my name morphed into many other funny nicknames at that point. ;p|`|xypkwlpBaa	tell your b.f that he is calling you mom.<br>  he will like that because if your close with his kid.he will be closer be closer with you because he probaly needs a mother figure in his life to help out raising him and if the kid really likes you then your in<br>  the mommy thing is cute.!<br>  i wouldnt think much of it|`|WgQyGnrxaa	I'd say get over it... he's just a kid, he's probably just looking for someone to love him, it even could have been a mistake, and it's kinda selfish of you to get freaked out by it. You're 19... GROW UP.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	If you're considering a serious relationship with your boyfriend, that moment is prone to happen and this is going rather great in my opinion that his son adopted you. However if youa re embarassed about people looking/judging when he calls you mom in public, you can tell your boyfriend to tell his son to call you "aunt" or something. Not as aunt you are his aunt but you know how adults always tell kids, this is auntie/uncle etc etc? <br>  One day he will eventually become your son though either way|`|tRcO5uyiaa	It's very exciting when a child who isn't your own calls you "mommy". I remember the first time I heard it. I felt all warm and tender-hearted inside. You may be young, but you chose to be with the bf, and he has this little boy. They are a "package deal". And you should be more than flattered. It is very difficult for children to adjust to a new living situation if their parents are no longer together. Many of them will not accept a new "mommy" or "daddy" into their life. I think you are very fortunate. No need to brush it off. Talk it over with your bf, see what he says. I think he will be very happy about it. Obviously his son loves you or you wouldn't have been called "mommy" at all.|`|WuwhfyT9aa	You are important to the kid.  Unless it bothers you let it go, he needs the emotional attachment.  If you don't want to do that have a discussion with your boyfriend and see what his thoughts are.  If you can't talk to him about it then maybe you need to work on that relationship some first.|`|Ua2A5TEvaa	you should tell your boyfriend what his son said to make sure hes not uncomfortable with the situation. If he is alright with it and no one is pressuring him to call you that I think its ok. Maybe you guys should sit down with the child and explain to him that your not his mommy but you love him just as much as a mommy would. Also let him know that he can continue calling you mommy if he choses to|`|dXRrxxrFaa	Tell him.<br>  And together you guys could work it out.<br>  Maybe sit the kid down and explain your not his mommy.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	please he know you are not his mommy but he is showing you that he likes you so wake up. Kids don't normally call dad's girlfriend mommy so you are lucky

Are you quite small and is he large? You should try different positions, perhaps if you go on top - in this position you'll have plenty of air and your chest won't be compressed by his weight. Alternatively you could try spoons position (side by side with you facing away from him) doggy style or any other position which gives you a bit more space. Hope this helps!|`|MYU46ap5aa	Maybe you should try to take control and be on top.  Don't have sex with him if you don't feel like it.<br>  <br>  Hmm you must be having a boy because girls make you want to have sex all the time.  Boys are the opposite.|`|AA11140814	its because you're nervous, on top of the claustrophobia so that doesn't help. If you just tell your partner, i am sure they will understand. i mean after all, the sex has to be good for both partners.|`|V5CRGK86aa	Sex is supposed to be enjoyable. Either your partner is too big for you, or you just aren't attracted to him...?|`|yhp6Zvzaaa	sex shouldn't make you feel uncomfortable. <br>  maybe your doing it with the wrong person.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	find a smaller parter.   or you on top or doggie or...|`|ObiLYekDaa	number one. how old are you? are you in love with your partner. do you have hi blood pressure?

You might only have a date every 2-3 weeks.....are you going to spend that time fighting or making the most of it!.......you're going to make the most of it!<br>  Put the two of you together on a full time basis and it probably wouldn't last.  You're obviously not thinking about why you broke up in the first place.  Full time relationships take a lot of hard work by both partners to make it a successful relationship.  What you two are basically doing is occasionally playing house.....no committment, no responsibility.  Big difference!|`|WvOvoxLxaa	You are the best kind of friend, one with benefits.  He doesn't have to worry about you seeing him with other girls, because you are not a couple. He has the best of both worlds.  See you don't see him while you are gone so he can do what he wants and he probably doesn't act like he is in an exclusive relationship. But then you can date whom ever you want also.|`|Ou3sFkKeaa	well because its always easier with a friend when its a relation ship ur scared 2 screw up but as friends it don't really matter
9b355e061fa6c3b030996f1809e2369aaa	Tell him to leave you alone.<br>  Its not easy to forget the fact that he cheated on you. When you say that you still love him, consider if it will stay like that forever? If not may be this is the time to say goodbye. But if you really love him very much, if you believe that he will not cheat again and if you can live with him and the fact that he cheated on you once, consider a second chance. But think thousand times before you decide to give him a second chance.|`|zBC6n34Naa	Tell him you're just too busy studying grammar right now because you don't want to look like a ten year old when posting on Yahoo Answers?|`|XpmjLuMIaa	Tell him to back up and leave you alone|`|igrdohopaa	Ignore his calls and change your number so he can't reach you.<br>  I would do that.
tCiVuFK9aa	Who are you trying to kid.  The reason that you aren't asking your mom is because she isn't dumb enough to think that you have to go to town to study during school hours.  You're 14, how in the world do you think you can disguise your voice to be adult and don't you think the people at the school are smarter than to fall for that?

Plan out what you're going to say before you call. If you don't and you get nervous, you'll probably get caught. I know tons of parents whose voices sound really young, but they never get questioned on calling in their child. As long as you sound like you know what you're doing, then you should have no problems. I mean even if they don't believe you, you won't get in trouble. They can't prove that it was you who tried calling in. Keep the conversation simple and don't over explain anything. Say "Yes, this is (mom's name here) calling in for my daughter (your name here). I wanted to let you know that she has a dentist appointment for Monday and I need to call her in" then answer any questions they have and don't volunteer any more information. Make sure you request the whole day off. It will work trust me. I had a friend call me in once and she was this ghetto girl and they still believed her lol.|`|ChQWhMfWaa	Hi. I've had to do this because I was sick for a whole week and I had to call into school 3 times and sound like an adult, I'm a boy so I just made my voice sound deep, you should just twist your voice a little just to sound a little bit more like your mom. Use adult words and even try to twist the case: instead of "Hi, my daughter is going to be out of school to day bye!" try something like "Hello, is this (Name of your school) school?, Well, my daughter (Your name and second name) in grade (Your grade number) is going to be absent today because she has to go to the hospital, but we will keep you updated, goodbye!" Be calm and answer any questions asked in a mature manner. Don't skip school for the sake of it though! I was never caught, but this was partly because it was true, however I have had to call people in class for certain reasons and I just went into a room and closed the door because only me grandmother was home and she was in the other room, you can always do it in the bathroom or when your out to the shops! Good luck!|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I don't understand why you are calling. Can't you just skip school and then the next day come in with a forged note, so then you don't have to change your voice at all.

Sounds like you are going to a lot of work to study.|`|n2cUQuUHaa	lol i've done this  few times and i am fouteen also. just try to petend that you are like a business women and think adult. you school isnt gonna ask if you really the parent and if they do just pretend your offended and be like OF COURSE!! dont be intimadated just act like liek your calling for a doctors appointment and you haveabsoulutly nothing to feel guilty about. make it fun!!|`|rh1XoOhvaa	I don't think you have to deepen your voice, because the secretary won't know whose voice it is.<br>  <br>  Just tell them what you need.

dIS08i1oaa	It is the Cut that breathes life, fire and brilliance into a diamond.  Most retail stores don't disclose Cut quality (and they sell "Good" or "Fair" cuts to make a little more profit).  If your diamond comes with a certificate from a lab such as GIA, the Cut dimensions will be listed.  The most important Cut dimension to look at is the Pavilion Angle.  A Pavilion Angle of 43.1% will return the greatest amount of light to the viewer's eye.  Look for a Cut grade of Excellent or Ideal.<br>  <br>  For your diamond Clarity, stay away from I3, I2, and I1.  Anything rated SI2 or higher for Clarity is considered "eye clean", meaning that there are no flaws visible to the naked eye.  You can pay a lot more for a VS Clarity, but unless your friends have a magnifying glass they won't be able to see the difference when you wear the diamond on your hand.<br>  <br>  For your diamond Color, stay away from anything rated I, K or below because it will have a noticeably yellow cast.  F or G is a good Color rating for value.  You will pay more for a D or E Color rating, but after the diamond is mounted it is nearly impossible even for a trained gemologist to discern the difference between E and F or G Color.<br>  <br>  So this is the combination of ratings on the GIA scale that will afford you the largest diamond and still maintain a very high degree of beauty and brilliance:  Cut:  Ideal or Excellent, Clarity: SI2 or better.  Color: F-G.<br>  <br>  You should be able to find a 1 carat diamond with these ratings for about $2500, which leaves you about $1000 for a fancy mounting with side stones and a matching band.<br>  <br>  If you want a plain solitaire mounting, you can get a 1 1/4 carat diamond with the above ratings for about $3600.<br>  <br>  Make sure your diamond is certified.  If you buy it from a good online source, the markup on wholesale cost will be between 15%-20%.  If you to to a mall jewelry store, they will usually try to get a 50% markup.  But don't be shy about bargaining the price down with a retailer.  There is an oversupply of diamonds at retail this month and the stores are very motivated to reduce diamond inventory.  Search for your diamond on a website like BlueNile.com, print out the results and show the pages to the jewelry store manager.  This will give you more credibility as you try to bargain the price down.<br>  <br>  I have noted a link below where you can read a more in depth article about Cut, Color and Clarity.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Ok so you want a round diamond, for 3000-3500 you can get something really good.  What kind of setting do you want, a solitaire in gold bought loose will run 325-350, platinum 700, side stones can run high but suggest staying under 1000.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a well balanced stone.  Cut, clarity, color, and carat are all important, but cut and clarity are most important.<br>  <br>  Other considerations, fluorescence, girdle, table, depth, symmetry, and polish, and certification.  You want no fluorescence, GIA certification, good at least polish and symmetry, girdle can be thin, medium, or thick, no extremes, no very thick, extremely thin etc.  Cut you want v. good or better, color H or better, table 52-63, depth 58-63.

On the E/VS2 you could pick the gold 1/3rd ct pave setting for 681, or the channel set rounds 1/3 ct for 671 and stay in budget.  For the G/VVS2 you can get the gold solitaire 2.5mm for 305 or 3.0mm for 325<br>  <br>  Of the F/VS2's I prefer the .73 for 2,484.31 because of the ideal cut, and the price.  With this diamond you can pick a platinum pave 1/4 ct setting for 1102, or the 1/3rd ct platinum baguette for 1073 and stay in budget<br>  <br>  Of the G/VS2's the .90 is a deal,  the .79 is  better than the .80 price and cut and size is comparable, the .79 is better than the .73 too.  For these two you can still get the platinum solitaire in 2.5mm or 3.0mm (I don't recommend 2.0 too small) and still stay in budget. 2.5mm 675, 3mm 775<br>  <br>  So I narrowed it to 4.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Clarity is most important. Try to get a VS level of clarity or better. Most diamonds offered are pretty poor, and most of the cost is in the ring. Get a cheap ring and a better diamond  it then becomes a good investment.

For just the diamond, depending on how smart you shop, you could get a quality diamond that's about 1carat with color around H and clarity of SI1.  <br>  <br>  Obviously the nicer clarity and color, the more you may sacrifice on carat.<br>  <br>  Pricescope also lists reputable online vendors in which to purchase a stone and ring from.

My ring is .73 carat and it is excellent cut and held up to a 1 carat that was not excellent cut it looks the same size.  Mine has a transparent flaw in it that the jeweler said you can see with the naked eye if you look very closely and I did see it under a microscope in the store but I still have not been able to find the flaw by jsut looking at it and trust me I have looked.  Anyway I cannot remember what clarity or color mine is but its all in the middle -it doesnt look yellow or anything. I think round is the best way to go because it will be the most briallant and look the biggest with an excellent cut. Just go into a nice jewelery store and they should sit down and describe everything to you so that you know all your options. Make sure it is a GIA certified diamond before you buy it. My .73 carat excellent cut round diamond was 2500 and the ring was about 600 so I was right in your area. Ask about paladium.|`|8o1ZdCkuaa	It all depends.  What is most important to you?  You could get a huge diamond for that money but it will not be good quality or you could get a small diamond with great clarity and quality.  Also, the actual band could be VERY expensive if you want platinum.  If you go with white gold it will be a lot less and white gold does look a lot like platinum.  So, I guess my answer to your question is to ask you what is more important to you?  Size or quality?|`|xjazE0xmaa	Hi again, Lil Mermaid,<br>  <br>  I just answered your other question and didn't realize you had this one posted, too.  I think $3,500 is plenty for the diamond you mentioned in the other post--including the setting!<br>  <br>  For $3,500, well, I looked at that same diamond search engine again, and for $3,500 it had 124,141 diamonds listed.  I don't know if you're more interested in size or quality--everyone's different.  But based on your other question, I think you're probably trying to balance that--1 carat or smaller, really good color, but also as good a cut as possible for the money, right?<br>  <br>  So, I narrowed it down a bit more (.7 to .9 carat weight; colors D or E, only cut quality VS2 or higher, and I told it to stop at price $2,500, so you'd have $1,000 left for a very fancy setting and wedding bands, if you like.  And 66 diamonds came up that matched that.  Some were ideal cut, even.<br>  <br>  I've seen everyone's suggested places you can look to learn more about diamonds--there aer plenty of places.  The diamond search engine I was just using has all that info, too.  <br>  <br>  Again, I hope this helps.  And congratulations!
PyC1MIkXaa	Just go on about being friends with him. However, you have to be sure that you don't lead him on, and don't be too touchy-feely with him. That may cause him to believe that you like him. <br>  <br>  Or, if you please, just have a talk with him, and say that you're just not interested in a relationship right now, and you only see him as a friend.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	date other people.  dont have sexual relations with any of them.  <br>  if he cant handle that and wants more, you flat out have to tell him.  <br>  you should give him the opportunity to do the same.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	How about being honest about your feelings with HIM instead of US?|`|EmuGiGjJaa	You can't have your cake and eat it too, without hurting someone along the way. Let him know how you feel. If he has hopes for a relationship with you, let him go.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Next time you see him, say "I'm only seeing you until I can get someone better but I expect you to stay with me until I'M ready to break it off, O.K.?"<br>  Let me know how that goes.|`|Lxof5QrQaa	I guess that you just have to tell him.|`|IuJcKGroaa	Before you do anything that you will regret you have to tell to establish with him that your relationship is strictly plutonic and that you really do value his friendship and keep it at that. You need to set these rules in the beginning, if by some chance you both realize that you have feelings for each other then take that relationship to the next level. But if you trulyknow that this guy is not the one for him you have to tell him right away because you don't want to hurt him and it will get wrose if you don't establish these rules|`|n2cUQuUHaa	well i think you need to just explain that you only want to be friends, or if you go out to coffee or something make usre to emphasive the wrod friends alot!! like you such a good FRIEND. im glas were FRIENDS. until he gets the point and if that doesnt work try my first suggestion|`|yIRcd5X8aa	Just keep on being friends with him, if he wants to take things further just let him know about how you feel. Sometimes it's better to leave a good friendship alone, because turning it into a relationship can ruin things.|`|I7OZ4glFaa	friendhsip can mess up chances of being in a reltionship i suggest yall just be friends and nothing more but it doesn't hurt to try it but if it doesn't work be free as the wind!!! lol!!|`|AA12117694	I really cant say how to go about it to be honest.|`|zLnnkTX0aa	tell him you just want to keep it a friend ship and nothing more|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	huh?|`|I80ozj3kaa	just tell him how u feel ok|`|KoYauxM4aa	you should tell him how you feel, be up front because ultimately, you guys were friends in the first place. Trust me, it is much better to keep a friendship because if you get involved and things dont work out for some reason, the friendship almost never goes back to normal. And if you dont get involved but lead him on, you will only hurt him and then you will really lose the friendship. So just tell him where you are in life right now and be open, my opinion is keep the friendship. I have seen this happen to my friends countless times, and it happened to me once, only once, but it was enough for me to learn to keep friends as friends. Hope I helped =) good luck!|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	Just be honest with him and tell him how you feel and what you want. That way you are up front about it and you aren't playing with his emotions or giving him the wrong idea. Who knows he could want the same thing as you. If not then you guys can just move on and just be friends. At least he can't be mad at you later for leading him on and not being honest about how you feel.|`|ieTqqgbkaa	Ahh. I have a guy friend like that.<br>  All you can really do is tell him and hope he understands.<br>  You act as if he's a really close friend, in a way. <br>  If that's the case, then he shouldn't be at all upset about it.<br>  My situation worked out and now we're pretty much best friends, but a little bit closer.<br>  It's weird, but it's awesome. I love it.<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes alright. (:|`|KlzZikKJaa	Well think about it this way, you two could just be friends, but what do you think he thinks about you.. If he likes you then its best that you guys should be JUST friends, cuz if not, than you might hurt him in seeing other people. Sometimes called leading him on but i dnt think thats ur case.. if he likes u fully then its best to let him know it aint ganna happen so at least he knows.. but he doesnt and he feels the same about you.... well than you got urself a friend with benifts...haha|`|dBpWY76Maa	Say what you just said, exactly. Just be honest and he will appreciate your honesty and unless he's a total jerk or a crybaby, you'll still be friends|`|ayM5TlcXaa	you shuld sit him down and tell him that you want to be frends and not ruin wat you alredy hav
AA10496297	For our 5th anniversary my husband took me to the restaurant where we had our wedding reception (we only had 25 people at the Original reception). He had arranged to have the basic same flower arrangement on our table - the same wine, and entree, etc. He even had the bakery made a Miniature of the wedding cake. It brought back such sweet memories of our wedding and I was so impressed that he had paid enough attention to recreate the scene.|`|76nTvO4iaa	10th Anniversary<br>  <br>  We had just gotten a beagle puppy.  I told DH that I'd rather stay home and have a nice dinner with the family than go out, because leaving a 10 week old puppy at home alone didn't seem right.<br>  <br>  When I picked DD & DS up from school, I went to the store and bought expensive ($15+/pound) steaks to grill. My DD (age 8 1/2) & DS (age 6) asked if they could get some dry ice (they'd done some experiments with dry ice in science class that week at school).  I let them each get a small chunk.<br>  <br>  We went home and they went out on the back patio with bowls of water, the dry ice and the new puppy.  I kept an eye on them while I was unloading the groceries and constantly went outside to check on them.  They had SO much fun!<br>  <br>  About an hour later, I found a pile of nasty, bloody looking solid vomit in the hall.  I looked around and found the wrapper for the steaks under the kitchen table.  Our schnauzer (who HATED that puppy) was in DD's room, looking sick.  When I picked up the vomit, it was what was left of the $30+ worth of steaks I had bought.<br>  <br>  I went back to the store and bought $6/pound steaks for dinner that night.<br>  <br>  I will NEVER forget that Anniversary!
eeCoeMZsaa	you shouldn't have to think about that<br>  and he should understand and/or help|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You know, even though she is elderly, she knows if your in an unhappy place, and she would never wish that upon you.  You just need to talk to her and let her know your true feelings and she will want you to do what makes you happy.  Good luck.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if it is for the short term then what chance are you taking?  You do what you have to do and then you go back home.<br>  <br>  if it's for the long term then it's time to make other arrangements for mom.  She doesn't have the right or expectation to unnecessarily disrupt your life regardless of her situation.  Once you marry, your spouse and the family you and your spouse build together become your #1 priority.  Mom/parents/ siblings get relegated to lower rungs.  You still have obligations towards them but not to the point that you endanger your marriage.<br>  <br>  You decide what her needs are and you help her hire someone to come into the home so she can remain independent for as long as possible or you help her find a suitable retirement community near you where you can visit or you move her into your home or you place her where she can get the kind of help/assistance that she needs.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  now if mom is just an excuse for you to get out of a bad marriage then "woman up" and be honest and get out of the marriage.  Don't use mom as an excuse because when you meet someone you do want to be with, then suddenly mom is a burden and you're off with the new honey.|`|krQiDGCHaa	No, I would not.<br>  <br>  Your spouse should be your #1 priority.  If my mother were elderly and sick, I'd do everything I could do help her but I would not risk my marriage.<br>  <br>  My Mother actually is pretty sick.  She's young (47) but she is obese, and she takes about 9 different medications a day.  I live close by so I do whatever I can to help her, however I wouldn't move away from my husband to do so.  <br>  <br>  I'd either bring my husband with me, or I'd move my mother in with us if necessary.  Either that, or place her in a home if there were no other options.  <br>  <br>  You don't turn your back on your spouse.  Period.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	You don't quite identify the full issue, are you saying you're married but want to STAY with your Mom?  Why?  Is this temporary?  If she's ill for awhile, completely understandable.  Did so myself for a month with my own mother,missed my husband terribly however - but I certainly did my duty as a good daughter to a MOST beloved Mother...<br>  <br>  If you articulated a little better, perhaps some of us could be of more help...but under the circumstances, this is the best advice one can offer.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	sounds to me as though you are married to your mother!  When my mother was still alive, my wife and I contemplated moving to the area where my parents lived, in order to assist my dad.  We ended up not making the move because of financial reasons.  I would never have considered leaving my spouse to help with mom.  my mom would never have asked me to.  And my wife would not have allowed it either.|`|EbUSYjLRaa	yes husbands and wives come and go but we only have one mom
FZKFLTyLaa	Go camping. It's really romantic AND inexpensive. You can probably borrow the gear you need.
bO2rzfISaa	Ask your dr for a referral to a psychiatrist. Your son needs to be screened for mental illnesses. That explosive temper is a big tipoff. ADHD is treated by a psychiatrist, too. I'm not sure why you were told to go to a psychologist. They do talk therapy and can't prescribe drugs (at least in the US).<br>  <br>  You can also ask the school for an evaluation, which can rule out low iq and learning disabilities.<br>  <br>  If you know something's wrong, keep pushing for help.  Don't hit him or try to make a show of force. It won't help, and I doubt that he can control what's happening,|`|Sxlcyua5aa	Set an appointment up with His Pediatrician and talk to him/her about the situation and ask if there is a specialist who can test your child to see what the problem may be.   Doctors have many resources and they know more people than we do when it comes to things like this.   They can usually get you in quick if needed.   Good luck.|`|vJphK7cwaa	what kind of things make him mad? and what do you do when he starts hitting you, or throwing things?|`|gzNFcvJjaa	Give him a good whooping|`|w9W3wPCOaa	Show him who's boss. Aloth of kids try to control their parents by acting this way. Because when they act this way u feel guilt and you're most likely going to be nice to him and give him what he wants.. Yup kids are that smart. To fix this, dont play his game. its hard at first, but you gotta show him that you are the parent, and what you say goes. if you dont fix this now, he will do it for the rest of his life with you. it will get worst and more aggressive when he gets older.<br>  <br>  If ur positive that thats not the case. then maybe something is bothering him. i dont know ur son so its hard to say what to say lol.<br>  <br>  So yea maybe something is bothering him, maybe he is bullied at school. Maybe he misses his father??  is there a father figure in the house? (maybe not his real father, but any male that is an adult?)<br>  <br>  Kids need a father figure,  it is very importent.<br>  <br>  And yes, seek a psycologist. i really doubt that their is a 1 year waiting list. their is many other psycologist, look in the paper or on the internet, make sure he has his paper's and that he is well known.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

kx8WRRvsaa	twitter is a website where u post ur status and what ur doing and other people 'follow' to see what ur doing<br>  <br>  similar to the facebook status tool where u post what ur doing|`|19ff4a5476c7928c424d222a79658debaa	A twitter is someone who updates there thing that tells you what there doing every second of the day.<br>  EX:<br>  Brittney is eating pizza.<br>  Brittney is going to the bathroom.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Its a social networking site, like myspace but not so intense.Check out the website and see for yourself!|`|e1ea654a25d47e37c855569bc216f26caa	Twitter is great in that you can post your status updates remotely (from your cell, for example) and let's you easily "follow" people/groups you may have interest in.  If you want to know what your best friend is up to at any given moment and she's on twitter you can follow her.  So when she posts "I'm headed out to grab a latte" you can go "sweet!  Mind if I join you?"  Or you can follow headlines and items of interest by following groups like NPR or Starbucks......it's a great marketing tool for companies and they'll often offer deals just for their "followers".  I follow gDiapers and always get an insider's scoop on new products and sales.  Love it.|`|fpSGkfvEaa	It's a live real time blogging site. You can update your status continually but can only type about 140 characters at a time.
nCtJisCvaa	Yea i dont think thats right you are only 16 once and its like she cant just go after your birthday and thats messed up that you have to babysit on your birthday and many more days She is the one being selfish not you , you need to let her knoe how u feel and maybe she can explain|`|XGx9WORLaa	that is awful of your mom to go on a cruise during your birthday. If you want to go to I would explain that to her. If she won't let you and won't stay then good riddance with her let her go I would throw a big party at your house while she is gone and do whatever you want maybe she'll think twice about going next time if you trash the house lol|`|3RcMN0Ukaa	I would be disappointed, but I wouldn't stop her from going. It's a cruise! Everyone loves vacations/trips, we all need one no matter how many times you already went. Vacations don't come that easy (Unless she doesn't work). If you're really bummed out about that, why don't you celebrate early? It doesn't have to be right on your birthday, no one really cares, just celebrate it near your birthday.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	She is your mom so hopefully you can't tell her to do anything.  It would be nice if she stay and you should tell her that, but if I was you I would enjoy being 16 and hang out with friends or something.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	that sucks, i      to say it, but you are old enough to know the truth. your mom is a witch. and is she leaving you alone and babysitting. you are still a minor. she can,t just leave you without       supervision, thats against the law.|`|AA11185479	It's not your decision to forbid your mom to stay or go.  However, you can and should share your feelings with her, in a calm, honest way.<br>  Tell her that you are upset that she will be missing an important birthday of yours, and you are also upset that you are expected to assume extra work on your birthday, instead of being celebrated.<br>  <br>  Then suggest alternatives - perhaps she could leave a week later, perhaps you could go on the cruise with her, perhaps you could get to do something extra special on your birthday, etc.|`|7iEk06aDaa	LOl, what do you mean TELL her to stay and go? You can order your mom around like that? How obnoxious. Do you make all of her decisions?  Stop being a whine baby and 'let' you mom go!|`|gC8xO53Oaa	No honey, you're not being mean. Your 16th birthday is suppose to be a special one and I'm sorry she has done you this way. It won't do any good to ask her to stay I'm sure, but you should tell her how it makes you feel. This may not do any good either, but at least it will be in the open and she'll have to realize what she's done. It's too bad she isn't taking you with her!! What a memorable birthday that would have been. I hope you can find a way to have a nice birthday in spite of her actions. I'm sorry for you.|`|nCWjdyddaa	"Let" her go? I really doubt that you have the power to stop her. It's a bit insensitive, but maybe you can agree on another day just before your birthday and have a nice celebration. In our family, we seldom celebrate on the actual birthday anyway, because it's too hard to get schedules together.|`|AA11225724	sorry but your mother needs the vacation<br>  when you get older you will understand this<br>  <br>  I am sure when she comes back or before she leaves you will get a great bd gift from her<br>  hey it also gives you a break from her for a while too so enjoy|`|zWB3jHHPaa	dude, let her go. tell her she needs to go and rest.<br>  that way, unfortunately, when she comes back, she'll totally kiss your butt for missing your bday and you not making a HUGE deal out of it.<br>  (=

And randomly i'll think of him and i'll smile like a nerd!!<br>  it might be that your not ready to fully open yourself to him or that you just really dont like him.<br>  no biggie. just figure it out and deal with it. just dont string him along because your afraid of being "alone" cause its not fair to either of you.|`|grTFRJVjaa	not to sounds mean but i think that if you have to ask you may not be<br>  <br>  the best way to check it to try to give it a break and if you are attracted to him you will feel it, and if not well then you can still be friends.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, obviously YOU dont like your boyfriend.   :S<br>  <br>  or, you dont like him very much.  is there someone that you do like better?|`|UdVkkJf2aa	u dontlike him|`|JnXA68jyaa	When it's right, you know it. The fact that you don't know it means you should focus on friendship only with him, and keep the sexual element out of the relationship. Sex is supposed to be saved for a committed (married) relationship anyway. If he expects you to be sexual and you're not so sure you want to be, then he's not a good boyfriend and you should move on.<br>  <br>  One last thing: You will be happiest when your mind, heart and body act together. Don't compromise yourself for someone else's pleasure, because then you'll feel uneasy. I think that's what I'm hearing in your question, some uneasiness. <br>  <br>  Follow your heart, use your head, and don't do anything that doesn't seem right to you.|`|oJV3rvsRaa	Well if you dont have those feelings there, then you need to rethink the relationship..<br>  <br>  how can you date someone if you arent sure if you like him or not... expecially if you dont know if your attracted to him.

Her nervousness says volumes.  If she were uninterested she would of looked bored and not have been rattled.  She sounds a bit shy and when someone who is shy finds someone of interest who has romantic feelings for them it can reek havoc with their nerves.  Being forward and wearing one's heart on the sleeve is simply not done on the first few dates for such a person.  Patience is required here; indulge her shyness.  Do not stop being yourself though.  Risk asking her out again.  It is worth it is it not?|`|QIwhMrBraa	sounds like she likes u, i mean shes not fobbin u off is she, if she is shy ur gonna have to break the ice and get her to talk more else it will never happen|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	yeh defo ask her now !!!|`|PpGCchNPaa	Don`t ever try to read deep into shittt it just f`s up things go with the flow and call her this afternoon and say " Do you really want to see fri?" and when she says yes say I thought I heard you wrong" and say I would love to see you again even tonight if you can put up with me staring at you all night.<br>  and she will laugh and the ice is broken.<br>  Just do it and stop asking the idiots on here for advice because they for the most part are fatties that sit around all day wishing they had a date...accept me...lol|`|03c22ee76cbad52a4b0a40b6fab23c49aa	She either a) wants to see you again and wants you to ask her out again<br>  <br>  or b) was just being polite coz didnt know what else to say<br>  <br>  You're not gonna no which it is until u ask her out again.

Could be a number of things at that age.|`|k9uspUrTaa	find uglier friends...SIMPLE AS THAT|`|5nAnWp3daa	dont worry bout it you'll find someone we all do.....as for her being a friend she not friends dont show off...|`|bS67sHpPaa	Boy's like an honest girl. Somebody they know they can trust. If you came to me and talked to me like a friend, and I had a crush on your <br>  friend, if I 'dumped' her I would come to you because I know you would be an honest person. So be cool around the boys and just act yourself. I bet one day they will come round to you.<br>  Also, many relationships aren't made in school. Talk to some of your friends and ask if they know any nice boys. It's better to try and get to know more people out of school, and one day you will meet the perfect person for you.<br>  Good luck!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think you need to figure out if she is trying to get the guys you like deliberately to hurt you. Ever think of that?|`|sm4FH7viaa	I get that SOMETIMES not really usually I've had many boys but my friends don't like them the same way........well atleast I don't think so!!|`|fIrDIUjjaa	She's probably really loud and confident and knows how to charm them or maybe just very attractive, just be yourself, I'm sure boys like you, I mean you never know really. And is it that important if they do or don't? You're 14, you have better things to worry about, like friends are more important.|`|UwnXYMI4aa	there's something called GET A LIFE|`|ASXeYOjAaa	This is why children shouldn't date.<br>  You're clueless about WTF you're doing.|`|U3tZzGlgaa	This one's going to sting a little.  She's more physically attractive than you are, at least for now.  Wait until you mature before seriously looking to be with a guy.  It will be after high school when guys grow mature enough to be with a woman for her personality.  This is the type of guy you'll want in the long run.  The guys at your age, even the seniors, are still just looking for the "hot" looking chicks.  They rarely give a **** about personality.  Your friend should be more sensitive to your feelings too.  If she keeps showing off, you should stop doing favors for her and find a better friend.  Remember that if you hang around an uglier girl than you, you'll be the one to get all the attention.  Funny, but true too.
oR40n3kPaa	Girls can be strange.  If she is putting you off it can be a number of things, her period, she's found someone else, or she might be tired of waiting for you to make a move... Best is to talk to her so you know 100% what her issue is..|`|c8hMZiFSaa	Yeh,<br>  You should just talk to her.<br>  I think that would be the best idea!
rXLtu8UDaa	Yes|`|SzjxADfFaa	doesn't matter if its right or not, whatever works for you|`|PTwQMnTRaa	It depends.  Are you wearing them to use them - Or do you like the way they feel on you.  Here's my take.  You are going to catch a lot of flack from this question, but what ever does it for you, as long as it puts no one else in harms way.  If you plan on using the diapers, then you might get turned on by the idea of doing something socially unacceptable, You might like anal play, many like the feeling of urination at times, you might like the felling of being as helpless as a child, who's to say.  Don't lock yourself away just yet.|`|jbQOC5kJaa	It's OK.  It's a recognised fetish.<br>  Whatever rocks your boat.|`|PS83gPGoaa	em ye probs tho sounds abit wired

It seems like there is a lot of potential for that kind of activity though, if you knew what you were doing.<br>  <br>  3) Skype.  It's free and ridiculously easy to use plus the quality is unmatched.  I know I sound like a commercial but it really is the best way to video chat over the internet.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	Web cams are god sent to people with long distance relationships but after a while it becomes not enough and your relationship can suffer big time if you are apart for to long. i have had a Long distance relationship for 2 years and hopefully it will be over this month, but i have used a web can all this time and although it helps as i said after a while it is just not enough. And no i have never used it for sexual pleasure but i know others who have.|`|39X8e50Raa	well me and my bf are in a long distance reationship and  we both go on msn and use webcams to see each other which is really nice when we are missing each other <br>  <br>  and well to satisfy yours "needs"  you could do some stuff we have tried it but we usually just send it other some rather naughty text messages and photos  =]|`|vtafeEIJaa	intresting|`|Mzl7SLFQaa	MY BOYFRIEND LIVED IN MICHIGAN.

qZOuxR1Raa	i think family comes first. There have been so many times when i thought my mom didnt understnad my situations but really she always ended up right. It's only a two year difference but becase yer 16 (17 in july lol) and hes 18 (19 in june :] ) it probably seems like a bigger deal then it really is to your mom. My advice would be wait because when your 18 n hes 20 it wont seem that big a deal because even though 16 and 18 or 17 and 18 don't seem that far apart i think people mature alot in that amount of time. If you guys are still willing to be together and can wait for eachother then it's really love in wich case it was worth the wait. But if you think something better comes along, don't blow it off.|`|a531cd98fd2b70b96fa7a80f7571935eaa	I wouldnt let you see eachother either, your too young, and he's too old to trust, well any guy around that age cant be trusted with a daughter. It's not love, its an obsession, do you need him, or do you want to need him?|`|Ds5sow0faa	Age is just a number. Don't let that get in your way. My mother is 11 years younger than my father. Age doesn't determine love. Just wait it out. Time always heals things. Unless its Cancer.. <br>  <br>  But yeah! Wait it out until you're 18 then you're 'technically' not under your Mom's rules anymore. Have fun! :) But not too much..|`|t9I2VzfBaa	first of all i dated someone that was 2 years younger then me and we lasted for over 2 and a half years so you can do the same. you could change your moms mind just by telling her that you have already been together for a year why does it have to stop now and its not illegal so i see no problem. the law states at least where i live that there has to be 4 years in between to be illegal but its possible to be illegal if you dont want to be in the relationship but be careful around sexual stuff it can be considered underage sex or watever but yes you can fall in love with someone in this situation but i suggest you take it slow and if its meant to happen its meant to happen|`|gaZ5CJw6aa	its possible.<br>  don't rush yourself to fall in love.<br>  if its happening let it happen.<br>  but you need to just try and do what you guys are doing now.<br>  when you are old enough and you guys are still together..see how things play out.<br>  you can only show your mom how you care about him..<br>  and let her know..<br>  but don't ask her to change her views..<br>  she is probably only thinking of what is in your best interest right now.
G6Uy43coaa	I saw this question earlier this week.  Watch who you date and how you present yourself.  Did you talk about what kind of relationship you were looking for and would like have at the beginning of dating?  If you didn't...next time you will know.  <br>  <br>  Did he pay you to date him?  Did he "supplement" your income? Why else would he think you are a high class hooker...?  You start letting a man pay your bills, your tuition, your car and house payments and you sleep with him....well...you know where I'm gong with this.  <br>  <br>  You need psychiatric help....seriously.  This scenario appears to be overtaking your entire life.  Prayer wouldn't hurt.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Are you still going on about that "NOBODY". Million different people told you what to do.This man is dangerous and mentally ill.<br>  Reconfigure your mind and invent a perfect identity. Determine who you want to be, how you want to think, what beliefs you do and do not want to have... bringing about a dramatic shift of mind and existence.<br>  Apply the science of Mind Conditioning to permanently change any positive pattern of thinking about him, feeling, or behaving towards him. With this in place, the results you want to achieve become the results you attain.<br>  <br>  If KJ JR or Jerry E is around I hope they give you good answers.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7MJSPGnhaa	My patience with you is GONE!! You have asked this question now 13 times or more in three days.  Listen you need to seek psychiatric help because you really aren't getting it!!  You're a big part of the problem in your little scenario.  If you hasn't taken his call and basically invited this loser into your life and your place of work you wouldn't be here now!!  Change your number STOP TAKING HIS CALLS and move on for the sake of the sanity of everyone here because I, for one, am sick and tired of this question!!!|`|bO2rzfISaa	Posting the same thing everyday isn't going to help you stop thinking about this. Get out, meet some new people, develop some new hobbies, move on.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i can only wish you well.. but its over now thank god .. when he moves to the other state .. you need to just .. go out and find a nice new guy .. good luck to you ..|`|IvMPh09baa	why is it so hard to forget him?  he's a piece of crap.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	A good way to start forgetting about this man is to stop asking questions about him and trying to understand why he did that.<br>  <br>  Also, in the future, I hope you'll be more careful about taking semi-nude pictures with someone you've only been dating a short time (I read your question yesterday). <br>  <br>  Just, stop thinking about him, stop trying to analyze everything and MOVE ON.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	that guy is my hero.<br>  no, seriously, what did you wanna hear that you don't already know?|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Obsessing isn't going to help! Stop asking the same question over and over and just tell us exactly what it is you want to hear already!|`|aSSXt6tlaa	he sounds like a total alcohoic jerk.   wake up please.  honor the decent guys out there by having some respect for yourself and try a decent guy for a change.|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	You need other people to tell you he is bad in order to dump him?  You can't see for yourself?  Time to move on.|`|aErUKUvVaa	can u say LOSER? move on and never communicate with him again.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	And you still call him your boyfriend? Get rid of this guy and never look back.|`|AA11208683	it kinda sounds like if things don't get better and if he doesn't leave you alone, that you need to call the cops for harassment, and get a restraining order on him... he sounds like a real a**hole who definatly does not deserve you. he sounds like a slug who just uses woman for fun... get away from him as far as possible, and just ignore him... he isn't worth it at all... in one of my past relationships, i was abused almost every way possible, and i let it hurt my relationships after that because i thought every man was like that, but i was totally and completly imature and a fool... there are men out there who will treat you with respect and will love you.... just forget about him and move on.... get a different job if you have to move away.... do anything that will get him out of your life! but if he keeps up this crap he is doing to you call the cops.... he needs to know he can't get away with it! i really hope things get better!!!! ill be praying! good luck!|`|seK612Zmaa	hunny, tell him it's over, ovb u could to better!<br>  hope i helped!<br>  x
ONwdLfF4aa	i dont think u should hunni, i did the same thing once and i really really really regretted it after, i fell out with that boy and i couldnt believe i put myself through the embarassment. im not saying he's like that but he could print screen it and do whatever he like with it, including putting it on the internet.<br>  i know u dont want to lose him, i felt like that too but if he likes you as much as you like him, he'll understand<br>  u doing this will not increase your confidence, i judt dont want for you to do something u may later regret<br>  good luck hunni, hope u make the right choice<br>  xx|`|7qvaXOFzaa	OMG, no don't. I am going to give you reasons why...<br>  <br>  1) He might record it and put it on the internet.<br>  <br>  2) It is seen as child pornography which is illegal and could get you and him into jail. <br>  <br>  3) He could record it and show it to your family. <br>  <br>  4) I really love a girl and I would never get her to strip for me unless she was willing to which therefore means he doesn't care about you and might be using you just to get horny.<br>  <br>  5) I can swear on anything about this but when you are older you will regret.<br>  <br>  6) If he loves you and you say no, he will be okay with it.<br>  <br>  7) He lives 100 miles away from you, I don't think you will ever get him anyway so what's the point of saying you don't wanna lose him. He isn't yours anyway.<br>  <br>  8) He might already have a girlfriend. If he is 100 miles away from you... what will you know about what he's up to. <br>  <br>  9) You can find a better person than him.<br>  <br>  10) Love is not only about sex or getting horny.<br>  <br>  11) If you do then you're stupid. No offence.<br>  <br>  12) Why don't you just ask him to strip for you first instead.|`|UmdCvYyPaa	SERIOUSLY DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!!! This guy is just using you. First thing you should think about is your pride you shouldn't have to do this to make this guy like you. He is obviously just trying to get himself off. Secondly if you did it would be classed as child pornography. You would be better off without this guy in your life and so would your cousin! I know if some one was doing this to my cousin id flip!!|`|5SCD87hTaa	if you want both of you to be labeled sexual preditors and never be able to get a good job then go ahead and do it.honestly by even posting this you are implimenting yourself into child pornography. do not do it. you will go to jail. dont believe me look up to punishents for child pornogaphy on the internet.|`|wALSmoHtaa	NO you shouldn't.  In fact, if you both have any knowledge about the law, your considered under age.  If it gets out of hand some kind of way, your both in trouble.<br>       And no you can't be sure he won't put you on the internet.|`|SmHaeishaa	No .. He is using you .. if he really liked you he wouldn't pressure you into doing it. Are you sure about who he really is? Make sure you know or you could really end up hating him and yourself. It could be a mistake. So DO NOT DO IT. Have some Pride girl . X|`|SMxKzQcbaa	don't even think about it and anyway your only 14 so what if you lose him there are plenty more boys out there. and he lives 100 miles away so wa is the chance of anything happening even though you stripped for the boy?|`|9u5A8uriaa	Defiantly not how degrading! It sounds like he's pressuring you! If he was a friend he'd understand you dont want to. tell him you don't feel comfortable and change the convosation. x|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	even if r confident also never do that,concentrate on studies,ur future is in ur hands.|`|afpLMmwRaa	u don't know who is around and if he likes you he won't be bothered if you do not strip on cam|`|edCGebTRaa	ummmm. . ..hmmmm. . .NO|`|cZaLXgEEaa	No! And are you SURE he's your cousin's friend? Have you seen him? Have you asked your cousin?|`|bETXpixXaa	OMG!! NO!!! NO!! NO!! NO!!! DONT DO IT!|`|cldZlGM2aa	he's using you, idiot! DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|WFZB4QnSaa	Oh dear god no you are not doing that jeezo|`|XtZxAyZSaa	wot the hell girl|`|AA11510511	Don't degrade yourself for him.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Absolutely not,they will get posted online for sure.This has happened many times over and what a sicko that he would even suggest this to you being a friend of your cousins.|`|fFnfFROQaa	You do not even know this person well enough.<br>  You haven't even physically met with him probably.<br>  You are not even his girlfriend that he regularly dates.<br>  He might actually have a girlfriend that you do not know about.<br>  <br>  You are only 14.<br>  If he really wants to see a girl strip, let him indulge his desires on local ones around his neighborhood.<br>  <br>  Stick to guys your age, around your area, and to those that you can actually go out on dates with.<br>  Maybe even try to find guys that think of you as a person, rather than a piece of meat they can drool over in web cams.|`|YegFsJyhaa	Lose him but don't strip on cam as you will regret it for ever|`|ybdNwzMBaa	DO not do it he will put it on utube Tell your mother he is a PERVERT.|`|czAbrzcUaa	No, have you not heard of the print screen button?|`|OFJFLs2Paa	Wow, regardless if you loose him or not. If you don't want to do something and he can't respect that then he is not worth your time in this relationship with him. He is just using you so he can have fun. You are to young to be doing anything like that for someone that will not always be there for you. Never do anything like that or have sex because trust me you will regret it if you don't wait for a person that cares about you and you care about them.|`|jhNUuz0maa	Confidence aside, you shouldn't do it. First off, its considered child porn, which is illegal, even if you are doing it. Second, you don't know who is watching and if they are recording it to use later. You might be older and have it come back to haunt you. <br>  <br>  If he is pressuring you to do this, then you don't need him in your life at all.|`|QIwhMrBraa	listen to me, and listen very carefully. do NOT do this. dont do anything on camera u might come to regret later, u have no idea what he will do with it, who he will share it with, or when it will come back to haunt u later.<br>  <br>  if he really likes you, he wouldnt ask u to do this, and he certainly will be ok with you saying no and not push you once you say no.<br>  <br>  if he isnt happy with 'no,' he aint so nice.|`|maWfU0LNaa	no! that's awful, never do that. you will feel dirty. you are far too young for these things, take it slow, be a real lady. you will feel great about it.|`|syKIxX45aa	No you should not, you could easily get into trouble at your age.|`|X9kUtwqSaa	No, if he likes you he wouldn't pressure you to do that.|`|WJ3vOxXWaa	noooooo!|`|RW6YWEc2aa	if anyone agrees with you and tells you to do it...God Bless You Both<br>  x
zxQT3Uo5aa	You really have no fidelity with him so why hurt him with your behavior.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Stop hurting him.  Cheating and then telling is your way of getting back at him and you don't really want this kind of relationship.  Then you don't have to feel guilty about not telling him.  Move on and let him move on.|`|0myrXJKMaa	The truth will set you free....literally in this instance. You are lucky he has come back to you twice already. Very lucky. If you love him so much, why do you cheat on him? When you love someone, you typically do not want to hurt them like that. The thought alone, of hurting my fiance, quickly disengages any scandelous thoughts. Some people though, are open relationship type of people. How would you feel if he was having sexual relations with other women? If the thought doesnt bother you then maybe you should talk to him about having an open relationship|`|7akG7iRPaa	well your stupid for doing that and thinking hes gonna stay with you... honestly i wouldnt of took you back if i was a guy. put your self in his place would u really stay?? honestly yea u should tell him u prolly will lose him forever but u need to deal with the consequences you made for yourself|`|79Fcbmtvaa	You are a complete idiot. He doesn't deserve you if your going to cheat on him four times. Get a sense of morale value.|`|AA12148009	Ok,<br>  For one i don't think long distance realtionships work at all. I have been in 2-3 and they just do not work.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Yes, you should tell him because lying is a great way to destroy a relationship. And yes, that news is going to hurt him. And if he doesn't break up with you (which he should), then I think you need to do the right thing and break it off with him. He doesn't deserve the cheating, and you need to be away from him and any relationship long enough to realize the value of a morally sound, respectable and committed relationship.|`|JFJF3GPWaa	You need to seriously think whether you still want a relationship with this person, if you are really that happy with the relationship why would you have cheated on him? you are obviously not fully satisfied. I don't think you are happy in this relationship and should think about breaking it off because it is obviously not working for you.|`|a6d56e0e2034b084029811b6a6064fdeaa	I think what have cheating on him is the fact that it is a long distance relation and it means ur not ready for those.<br>  Tell him the truth will be exactly it: risk totally loosing him forever but also the fact that u realize ur not ready to be in this kind of relations.<br>  Good luck.|`|X3kz6fG8aa	I think that you should not be in a relationship until you figure out what it is that you want.  It sounds like you are not physically ready for a commitment.  I say tell him and let him make the choice to stay with you or not.  If he decides not to then you should respect that.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	If he is mature enough and can handle you telling him you're into threesomes, he should be delighted!  If you think he can't handle that information, then maybe he's not the one for you because you're more adventurous than he is about stuff like that.|`|No3wL14Yaa	You should just tell him because keeping it from him will hurt in the long run. It is better to be honest and let him know rather then trying to keep it from him.|`|wZb7zilKaa	Don't tell him he might think your a WHORE!|`|b7PG9kHoaa	no dont tell him|`|t9I2VzfBaa	if you love him you should tell him...the best thing would have been to not ever do it...just because he is long distance does not make this ok...idk if it will work out because of this or not but keeping stuff from eachother is not the way to have a healthy relationship|`|SaTa58emaa	No... what good will it do to tell him? All you will dois urt his feelings. U were selfish to cheat, and now u wanna be selfish and confess to make yourself feel better...I am not judging you, I am actually cheating on my boyfriend too.... but I would never break his heart by telling him!|`|oxlYMtfcaa	You're a b*tch and your guy is an idiot for sticking with you.<br>  <br>  Cheated 2x?<br>  <br>  What a dumba*s he is for staying after the 1st time u cheated, lol!|`|8iAgVLohaa	you have no soul. i hope he's doing girls left and right because you don't deserve him. break up now because you're a whore and whores shouldn't be in relationships.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	long distance relationships pyschos' work.. u need actual human interaction, technology these days is responsible for so many ''heartbreaks and pyschos'|`|djAfkJTYaa	its not good to lie so just tell and see what happens!

So i'm having inside, maybe you could find a place where you have the OPTION of having your wedding outside but can move inside if need be or a place with ceiling glass (windows), have the natural light and everything but no getting rained on.|`|29I8PWrxaa	We are having an outdoor wedding in June 2010 in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.  I have been to several outdoor weddings and not once has it been rained out luckily.  However, we have a backup plan ... if we have bad weather the day of the wedding our reception venue is willing to set up so that we can get married there indoors.  Then they will take down the chairs set up and re-arrange for the dinner and dance.  As long as you have a back up plan - either a tent or an alternate site that is indoors, then it's perfectly fine.  Sometimes it's good to look at a Farmer's Almanac to check out the best days to get married outdoors based on weather patterns.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	As long as you have a Plan B in place, there's no reason to avoid planning an outdoor wedding.  Just make sure your venue is equipped with a gazebo or indoor facility in case of inclement weather, and just rent that out too, to be safe.  <br>  <br>  Also, I once saw a wedding on a website that was outdoors, and in case of rain (which it did), the bride and groom furnished the guests with adorable umbrellas with their names and wedding date printed on them.  It doubled as a necessity and a favor!|`|o6ACs5z4aa	I live in Kansas and had an outdoor wedding.  We got married in August.  Plan for everything though.  Our day was sunny and 110 in the shade.  But you know what I loved it and it went great.  I think that it is fine, just be prepared.  Good luck.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Outdoor weddings are great, if all goes well.  That's the kicker.  The best thing to do is have a back-up plan.  Have a place nearby you can go in case it does rain.  Tents are always a good option, too.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I am having an outdoor wedding, so I don't think it is a bad idea.  But you should have a back up plan in case it is raining...We are planning on getting married in front of our lake in our back yard and having our reception under a huge tent.  If it does rain we will just be moving the ceremony under that as well.|`|sLLgERQWaa	My wedding ceremony was outside in a large white gazebo....it was early fall in upstate NY so the weather co-operated. It all depends on the area of the country & the season (take into consideration any possible 'bug' season, too.....and always have a back up plan should the weather NOT co-operate.....good luck.|`|ELIKp5tDaa	lol, no, just make sure you have a building large enough nearby to get everyone into in case it does rain or have huge awnings and some gravelled walkways around <br>  <br>  i want an outdoor wedding myself actually..always have...|`|AkUhaMm9aa	No its not a bad idea...most people like to have indoor weddings..just have a back up plan..<br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do about the wind...even if it doesn't rain..just be prepared..its like planning to go camping...<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Outdoor wedding's are very spectactular.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	SLAP ! <br>  <br>  calm down woman.... just take a chill pill.<br>  <br>  if you wanna have it outside fine, but if you are having this many doubts have it inside<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  solutions<br>  <br>  rain = tent<br>  wind= ?|`|jBjc1UACaa	depends on the kind of weather...spring and fall then yes...but summer or winter then no...too hot and too cold|`|XT3h9kgaaa	I am a wedding coordinator and the facility I work for has two outdoor ceremony locations. Two things to look into is check with the Farmers Almanac and see what the weather has been like on that day and the your ceremony location has a backup plan just in case.<br>  <br>  Here is a blog for the location I work at, it has lots of ideas for outdoor ceremonies and some for backup plans:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uniquelyyouplanning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uniquelyyouplanning.com/</a>|`|wVZuBL0Zaa	Mother nature is always making us guess so you have to have a back up plan for bad weather. One of my family members had an outdoor wedding and a bad rain storm came in that day and they had to change their plans and get married inside. The wedding was still beautiful though. So if you are planning an outdoor wedding you may need back-up tents or a building for bad weather.|`|HcboXOmjaa	They can be risky, but I think it's worth it.  My brother got married at his now wife's backyard.  It rained literally 10 minutes before the ceremony, then stopped. The ushers were able to dry off the chairs for the guests and the ceremony went perfectly. The sun even came out.<br>  <br>  They did have a backup tent across the street, however, in case it did rain during the ceremony.  Always have backup in case it does!|`|nCtJisCvaa	No outdoor weddings arent a bad thing, it just depends on the wedding but hopefully it will work out
l7E3EreXaa	I'm going through the same problem with an ex. She just wants to know that you're still attracted to her. It doesn't mean she wants to hook up again (or maybe she does for a one nighter). She just wants to hear you say or show that you're into her still. Just. Don't. Act. On. It.|`|XoflZ5eLaa	from a girls point of view.<br>  "shes just not that into you"<br>  <br>  or, if u think im wrong.. sit back.<br>  do nothing.<br>  let her START all the convos.<br>  let her do the work.<br>  see if shes really willing to put energy into it...<br>  goodluck :)|`|J9jb56L2aa	im a dude ant i say shy bypoler eat all her family one by one|`|CULqCWvXaa	i think our just being to analytical, let things go with the flow. if she keeps going in the direction she is with making herself distant mabye its time to find someone else?|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well ithink she wants you again
NvnddPONaa	Theres a lot of little signs. I mean, don't say "oh this girl likes me cause the girl on yahoo answers said that was how you know". I don't know everything (even though I am a girl. lol.).<br>  Heres different ways you can tell - Its different with different girls.<br>  - She will get louder when you come into the room, possibly to get your attention.<br>  - She will lean closer to you if you are sitting together (unless as friends you guys are pretty touchy.)<br>  - She will get shy and sometimes nervous<br>  - She'll flirt<br>  - She'll laugh hysterically at something you said that wasn't even funny<br>  <br>  Anyways, hope this helped and if you like her I hope she likes you to! As added advice, don't go out with her to just go out with someone... respect her. Women are NOT there to be used.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	She buys you a dingo, or a crock or maybe even a Kangaroo mate.|`|zrHE78DCaa	well its different with different people but some of the things i have noticed with me my friend and people i hate were<br>  <br>  they get all giggly and we sometimes blush<br>  sometimes we act different around you guys <br>  my mate just stared at him for ages until he looked at her if a girl does that to you make sure it is you she is staring at first rather than assuming|`|VPohcKwGaa	She'll flirt with you :)

P0Fjh59Eaa	I personally don't think so if it's something you do casually every once in a great while. but that depends, are ya spending more time looking at porn than with your wife? are you masturbating more to porn than having sex w/your wife?<br>  <br>  if yes, then yes it is kind of like cheating. since you'd be destroying the relationship for something else. which is what cheating is about.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	It is if she thinks it is...|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	No.  Cheating involves a lot more than just looking.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Not cheating at all.  I think it's totally fine as long as it's not a habitual thing.  Most wives would understand that some men just do it for something to do sometimes.  Just don't throw it in her face or even really tell her about it.  Make her feel like the only time you like to watch porn is when you're watching it together.  She probably knows you watch it, but she doesn't want to hear about it.|`|x02jsjg6aa	Only if you and your wife have agreed together that seeing anyone else of the opposite gender nude is "cheating."  This would mean you never saw any movies rated over PG, and you better hope you don't no one ever moons you or it could be the end of your marriage due to "cheating."<br>  <br>  Obviously it can be considered cheating, but it would make the whole relationship ridiculous.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	no its not cheating .. but woman get upset about this all the time .. i tell my wife she can watch it with me .. ... sometimes she just wont .. but others times she will.. so i just dont get it with them .. as well..|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	No, but if she doesn't want you to look at it because it makes her feel unloved or makes her feel uncomfortable, you probably shouldn't look at it or learn to cover your tracks. <br>  <br>  She is insecure and you are asking for a BIG argument if you do. Some women do feel you're cheating on them or that you don't find them attractive because you look at other women.<br>  <br>  Also, how much do you look at it? If it's everyday, you have a problem. If you'd rather look at it then spend time with her or have sex with her, you have a problem. These are all things you need to take into consideration.<br>  <br>  I personally don't care if my husband looks at it, but I don't want to turn on my computer and see it in history nor have popups all over the place. It works for us and as long as I don't have to see what he looks at, I'm ok with it.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Morally and pyschologically.....yes.  Understand that pornography begins as something simple and grows into an obsession.  You may think it is no big deal, but it is.  You will start to replace your wife, in your mind everytime you close your eyes, while you are making love.  You will begin to compare her to your visual stimuli and she will never measure up.  Pictures are air brushed and so no one looks that great.  But your fantasies will not be about your wife, but about what you have seen.  So yes, it is cheating.  Did you ever see Ted Bundy's last interviews before Florida put him to death.  You should....he talks about this very thing.  Pornography ruins every relationship you have and will ever have.  You can't erase those images out of your mind.  And it says in the Bible, if you think it....you have sinned it.  So if you have lust in your heart about a woman you have seen...you have already committed adultery with her.  Even if it is from a book or movie.  I feel for you and your wife..good luck|`|Nrk9fT8waa	I don't think at all! I think you may even want to ask your wife/girlfriend if she'd like to watch. Sure, she may look at you crazy, but She may even enjoy it as well. I strongly disagree that it is not cheating.. You're watching the tv, not doing anything at the same time with ANOTHER person most importantly!|`|ZzjUHawhaa	no but it may make the other person feel like u want something better or they are not good enough in bed. <br>  <br>  the best way to look at porn without causing confusion is ur partner has to enjoy watching them too.<br>  <br>  or tell ur partner u want to get some ideas so u can try different stuff in the bedroom - but they would have to agree to it before this can work.|`|woPLfLQbaa	I dont believe it is cheating however if you choose to hide the fact it could cause a trust issue. If you lie about watching porn, what else would you lie about? If you watch porn obsessively and revolve your schedule around porn, you have problem and it needs to be addressed.|`|JITTMjasaa	No, I do it with my man. Hmm maybe try doing it with her. Sometimes it's good for getting you two in the mood. It depends on the girl though so be careful.|`|oauYuhvDaa	I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but yes...I believe it is cheating.  The only body a man should lust after is his wifes...end of story.|`|AA10447677	Nope, I don't think it is.|`|ZEitfScGaa	It can be, sort of. How often do you get off to porn? Does your wife not like the fact that you look at porn? If so then it can be considered cheating. If she doesn't want you to then you need to respect her wishes. I know it may seem harmless, but it can do a lot of damage to your partner emotionally if you continue to do so against her wishes.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	oh boy.. it isn't cheating but is soooo degrading. I just went through this my house and it was to the point I felt like I was competing with the girls on the computer and was ready to hand over walking papers.. so I guess it depends on how your wife/ girlfriend sees porn and what her feelings are about it.|`|NwVfHUY4aa	Depends on how often the person is occupying their time with looking.  Why not engage the other half with ideas and spend time with them rather than the computer.  Some arousal is healthy but not to the point the other is complaining.  Share your fantasy with your better half.|`|pxygDg7Aaa	No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No|`|USooqQlWaa	No...of course it's not.<br>  <br>  If you try to involve her in it once in a while maybe she'll feel better about it.  Some women are really threatened by the whole porn industry.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	No. As long as the porn is not affecting your relationship or the time you spend with your partner. Why don't the two of you watch it together....|`|WmwEYzYkaa	it's considered a form of cheating, but if you don't mind it don't matter|`|AA11514533	nope...if you hide it from them it is cheating...<br>  <br>  ask her to watch it with you|`|MYU46ap5aa	No.  It's not cheating.  Try to get her to look at porn with you.  She might learn something. LOL|`|eWMn7dhKaa	No.  It is not cheating to look at something.|`|qJKqDPqMaa	Yes sir it is that's just horrible i am ashamed tsk tsk tsk|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	No.|`|S7uGTirdaa	no. it is not.
ByVkqiSCaa	as long as you have graduated college.  if not, stay away.|`|9z0CpCR9aa	no, i thinks its too much of an age difference.|`|dRIvxbpOaa	definitely|`|cbmkx5Joaa	I wouldn't and I know if I did my parents would disapprove. My reasons for not are mostly based on the differences in maturity and where you are in your life. Someone that much older lets say you are 18 (I don't know...doesn't really matter) and they are 30. You would just be getting ready to be an adult, go to college, or start a career. Someone who is 30 already has a career (most likely) and is settled down in life. At 18 a person is ready to go out and party.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	That depends on how old you are. If you are underage the it would not only be wrong, but illegal. However, if you are older then age should not be a barrier. I am engaged to a man 14 years older than me and I have never been more content.|`|2tnFQYhEaa	Yes and I'm 28, so my parents really have no say. I would however take their advice under consideration.|`|oPy0n9nGaa	I think it would depend on who it is.If you feel good with that and they do to then its not wrong.Yes I would date someone with that age differences.As far as your parents, I think it depends on who it is.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	yes i might, depends on the person, woman mature faster than men, and for the peeps, they will either like it or not but will get over in time.<br>  its your life, now go out and play...   :p|`|QIYHApEkaa	I personally wouldn't let my daughter do that unless she was at least 25yo or older, because at that point there's not really alot I could do exept voice my opinion.|`|GA8uInKDaa	Yes. I would. They would approve provided he is not married.|`|l0bLt48Kaa	yes i would, but not if i was younger than 18 of course (hehe)<br>  <br>  it depends on the situation to what my parents would say|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	depends on the girl/guy i would go out with someone older if they wanted to with me|`|X3kz6fG8aa	I think this question depends on what age bracket you are talking to...|`|Li9kuojFaa	uhhhhn no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|63ce01c2afc272b9e3cff76128b1abbbaa	my boyfriend is almost 8 years older than me. so its close to ten. why not?<br>  <br>  if you are between 18-23 why not date someone in their 30s. it helps since that age group is still kind off immature to get some guy who is more mature than you, it evens it out. <br>  <br>  that is what happened with me and my boyfriend he is very mature and im not so it evens it out and its interesting, we have been together for three years and we are happy.|`|D4x0NN9Naa	If you're over a certain age (i'll say 25) and have had some life experience under your belt (complete higher education, world travel, live on your own) then you'll find that the age difference isn't that big of a deal, since you'll also bring something to the table and are less likely to fall for the okey doke. If you're young and inexperienced, I wouldn't recommend it.|`|eO0iByzMaa	It depends how old you are. If i were in my twenties I would have no problem dating someone in their thirties although if i were a teenager I dont think it would be right to date someone who is in there late twenties or older.|`|GJMKflrNaa	no i tried dating a guy 6 years older than me and all i could think about was the age difference anytime i talked to him|`|sJfGliJVaa	if he was liuke and nice guy and my parents liked him then yes|`|k9uspUrTaa	its your life and your decison. so go ahead and make it.
TWCQCSfRaa	All these answers are great advise!  Use money to buy contraceptives.  If you are looking to save money, having a kid will reverse that.  Wait to have kids until you can afford them.|`|1l04qpOKaa	Open a bank account and save at least 10-15% of your income each pay check in a savings account. This will add up so you always have back up money. Try to figure out a budget for bills, rent, food and leisure. Maybe go grocgery shopping every monday and make a list and save coupons--if you really want to save. Try to stay away from things you don't need, it will be hard at first but thats the best way to train yourself to be responsible. Congrats on getting engaged :o)|`|di6p10Ifaa	open a joined savings account. Money that you will absolutely not touch. At your job have them take the max amount of money plus about $20 so you don't have to pay in taxes. Be frugal with spending on "extras". Things that are not necessary or things that can wait. Congrats on your new jobs!!<br>  <br>  one more thing, avoid credit cards at all cost, honestly they are nothing but trouble. Especially store credit cards like a sears card or something, they often have ungodly interest rates. They will cause you nothing but unecessary stress. If you can't buy it then and there with cash or money backed up in the bank then it is not worth it.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I think it is great that you are interested in saving money.  My first major tip I can pass on to you is this: DON'T EVER use credit cards to pay for anything you can't afford to buy cash.  I say this because when I first turned 18, I applied for lots of student credit cards and used them rather than get a job when I was in college.  By the time I graduated and got a job, I was already thousands of dollars in debt.  Not a good way to start out as a young adult!  So don't make the same mistake I made.<br>  <br>  Financial experts all agree that it is a good idea to set up a savings account and then have your job's payroll department direct-deposit 10% of each paycheck right into the savings account.  That way you never really see it on your paycheck, and you never really miss it.  I'm pretty sure UPS offers direct-deposit to its employees, so that should be easy for you to set up.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you've started looking at apartments yet, but try to get one that has monthly rent that equals no more than 30% of each of your monthly pay.  For instance, if you and your fiance each make a paycheck of $1000 every two weeks, that is $2000 gross, so probably about $1600 net.  30% of that is $480, so you and your man shouldn't go beyond $960 on your monthly rent, though of course a lower rent amount would always be better.  So keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Another good tip I've learned being out on my own is to create a budget together, in which you decide on a fixed amount that you can spend each month on rent, groceries, utilities, transportation, and entertainment.  Then stick to that amount!!  If you've only budgeted $100 for dining out or going out somewhere for the month, and you're already at that amount by the 15th, you just have to stay home for the next couple of weekends.  It can be tough to be so disciplined, but that is how you will be able to save money and be responsible so you can someday buy a house and be able to afford more.  Good luck to you both as you start this exciting new chapter together!|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Be very careful with credit cards.  Only have one and use it for occasional purchases- and pay off the balance each month. They will charge you a finance charge if you don't pay off the balance each month and they can really add up.  You'll need credit later on, so it'll help to have been responsible with a credit card.  But there is no worse way to start off a life together than being in debt.  <br>  <br>  My other advice is don't live beyond your means.  This means no big new flat screen TV for your new place together, new dishes, etc.  Figure out what your monthly expenses will be together (rent, electric, phones, etc.) and make sure that you can afford those basic expenses.  You'll also need money for groceries and gas.  But make sure to save as well.  Open a saving account that draws interest and deposit a little from each paycheck.. and don't take that money out!  Make sure that he understands all of that too.. If you are responsible with money and your fiance isn't (and you two live together and share everything) you'll be in just as deep water as he is.  Good luck!|`|nXZEoDO7aa	Best of luck, remember if there is Love there is a Home.|`|HMsgbFENaa	All of these previous posters had great advice. I just want to let you know that you should have at least one credit card and to use it infrequently. Get one with a low interested rate and no annual fee. If you don't start building your credit early your credit won't be as good. This is especially important if you are looking to buy a house, car, or other big purchase in the next few years. I had a friend who never had credit card or car payment and even though she had enough money to pay for a down payment of a house wasn't able to because she had no credit. It is never to early to think of these things.|`|9XlQdh2Aaa	1. Make sure you have a budget<br>  2. Only buy what you need, and when its on sale<br>  3. If you buy what you want, make sure its what you need<br>  4. Eat at home, instead of always going out for dinner<br>  5. If you're hot, open windows, don't always use the AC<br>  6. If you're cold, put on more layers, don't always use the heat<br>  7. Cut showers short<br>  8. Always turn off the lights in a room when you aren't using it<br>  9. If you have to, ask your parents for money<br>  10. Stick through it together, times will be hard but if you work through your problems, you will be super happy in the end.<br>  Good luck and I hope things work out for the both of you!!
oR40n3kPaa	don't read into it.  If he wants you he will let you know.  Don't make his actions into something more than it might be.  The day he tells you that he likes you then is the day you should take all his actions that way.  The worse thing you can do is get your hopes up and trying to live out something that might not be there.  Have fun, be his friend but don't read into it.  At the end like I said you might be mis-reading his actions and the only one that will be hurt will be you.|`|e98RKB35aa	He might like you but doesn't know what to do with himself.

If she feels she's not being paid attention to, she'll seek it.<br>  <br>  It's important to give her time alone - she clearly adores you - but it's important that you can have you time without so much drama too.|`|qAR26vRFaa	She's a year and a half, what do you expect?|`|bc4a087960c91a42e0bbb5ed98d2eed0aa	Typical jealously from a 1 1/2 yr old. You need to spend more one on one time with her, and reassure her that Mitchel isn't going to take her place. You didn't state your age, but maybe the other siblings or your mom could help out by giving her extra attention as well.
7pFVHdssaa	Between 20 and 30...why?
2pUU9RuYaa	where r u from?? cuz there's a lot of emo ppl in Houston, Texas..but i doubt ur from here...lol :)|`|GFJmg9BQaa	hahahaha.<br>  <br>  where  r u from i know emo ppl
w6DJj1a8aa	awwww well just tell her and ask her out to see so you wont miss out!!|`|16vMIGPiaa	You absolutely do NOT want to put on a performance intended to elicit some behavior.  That's being fake.  Either what she sees in you interests her or it doesn't.<br>  The way to move things forward is to find a way to talk to her.  My experience of most women is they are very verbal creatures.  Find words to honestly and sincerely let her know you're interested, without overwhelming her.  Ease up on it.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	tell her.. i need u.. or say i want u to be my Juliet??
aKBqMLuhaa	I've been there.<br>  and this is what I wish I knew then.... that I should have made the first real move to show them how I felt, rather than wait around for them to make the move. Boys who are friends don't want to ruin what they have with you, and girls can be quite difficult for boys to understand. <br>  BTW: don't get a BF just to have one, wait till you find the right one for you.|`|ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	Be careful what you ask for.  I envy you and your ability to develop strong friendships with guys.  You will always have the benefit of the insight you've acquired from your guy friends.  These guys probably respect you too much to play the same headgames they normally would with other girls.  Just enjoy your friendships is my advice...and one of these days you may develop stronger feelings for one of them.  In the meanwhile, listen and learn.  Do you really want to be treated like the girls you think they're interested in are treated?!|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well then do the opposite of what you normally do.  try that.  dont flirt?  hehe  nevermind, that wont work either.  hey, if youre interested in a guy, just tell him that you are.  anyone else, just tell 'em that youre not interested.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Find new people to flirt with, keep your friends as friends at least for now. A rocky relationship with one guy could ruin your friendship with all of them.|`|wIayNrbhaa	You may need to change your wardrobe. That will definitely get their attention.|`|X3kz6fG8aa	If they are long time friends I'd say that you will have a hard time changing the way they think of you.  If you are not interested in them romantically why would you want to change the way they look at you?  Woman work hard to try to disprove the myth that women and men can't be just friends without it being sexual.  If you want them to truly look at you differently, try bringing a date around them.  Let them see how you are with a man that you are romantically interested in.  Believe me they will take notice.|`|Ds5sow0faa	Find someone new and start off fresh. A good friendship sometimes makes the best type of relationship. Have fun out there and don't worry too much about what others think about you. Outside is just an appearance to the world. What matters most is your inner self. Others will see you for who you really are and go up to you. Don't trip girl. Just Carpe Diem. :)|`|FQeSo65Haa	Your only solution is to get girlier!! Duh!! Don't always be "one of the guys" .. don't act "manly" or "masculine", try to act a little more feminine or girly at times, although it may make you gag at times. Put on makeup and girly clothing. Gossip alot with your girl friend. You know what I mean .. little things that really add up to your overall image|`|0cfa553aecb57c33710d398bac40aa80aa	Try to stop flirting then with all of them. Just be yourself...That is all you can do and when the time is right, the right guy will come along and things will just click.|`|nGdH31Ucaa	you shouldn;t have to change yourself to<br>  get a boyfriend... i have a lot of guy friends <br>  too, so i know.<br>  <br>  just be yourself and wait for someone to <br>  come along.|`|HvJtiSExaa	change your attitude. be more confident|`|higqH8sKaa	just be yourself.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	change your look|`|7SpI1gXmaa	hey im somewhat in the same situation as u are my friends are mostly guys and i dont really have many girlfriends and its becuz at time its better. if u believe that u can flirt and that u are pretty y not go for it..have u ever tried hooking up with one them ??? mayb that will help u knw i flirt with them a lot to and we will always be friends but just try that and see what happens|`|AdwAHdidaa	Sounds like you will actually have to just say it. When ya'll get in a relaxed mode, where ya'll are just hanging out... just come out and say, "I think its time to try something new, I want to start dating and get a boyfriend." So when you flirt the next time they won't just look at you as joking.|`|PLuSpKRIaa	Ok so these boys need to like you for who you are and if that is like one of the boys than hang out with them one day and be all flirty and have fun and you will change their point of view on you and make them want to be with you|`|gaZ5CJw6aa	chances are ..<br>  one of your guy friends has already fallen for you.<br>  i'm not going to lie..lol<br>  i was in the same situation..<br>  until i found out more than half of my guy friends liked me..<br>  you just have to be yourself..<br>  you never know when someones falling for you|`|sJfGliJVaa	um be your self but try to hang out with the girls more then the boys are gonna be like omg i think i will ask her out cuz they love hangin with you|`|WvOvoxLxaa	If you act like a guy, then you are one of the guys. When you dress and act like a girl then you will attract their eye.  So be yourself, but be a girl you, and if you present yourself well they will be falling all over themselves to be with you. It will take time for them to see the new you, so be patient, guys are kind of slow on the up take.  But make them respect you also, don't be the easy girl down the block, demand they respect you and they will defend you until the death.
okXvWN5haa	she probly likes you, but she had a bf so she is probly bein confused  right now, cuz she probly loves her bf alot. that would b the only reason why she is still with him if he treats her like ****. i think that you should just continue being really good to her, and show her that you will treat her the way that she deserves. and after time she will notice that she is happier with you then she is ith her bf, and she will notice that she likes you. but give it time, cuz i was exactly her in this situation not to long ago. she will realize it, but you just have to wait, especially if he is worth it. good luck|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I think she needs to make a decision between you and her boyfriend. Sounds like she is sort of playing you both right now. She likes her boyfriend but also likes having you to turn to in order to console her. You deserve better. If you want to be with her then tell her and have her make a decision between her boyfriend and you. You may not like her decision but at least you will know. Then you can figure out if you are just friends or if what she is doing means more.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	Let her know. If she hasn't figured out that you like her by now, then she's crazy. But be careful. Some girls as well as guys like having something to fall back on just in case this relationship doesn't work out. Depending on how long you've known her. Don't let her say that she didn't know. Girls notice everything.|`|IzDF72Fiaa	I think deep down she loves you! <br>  But as long as she has feelings for this jack a** she will never see those feelings for you.<br>  But... maybe if they break up, tell her how you feel. But if you do that... dont hold back. if your gonna go for it... GO FOR IT 100% cause you have to remember there is a friendship behind it! <br>  <br>  :) good luck!|`|3T8Tikmhaa	I don't think she loves you, but she does like you. If you to were to date, i'm sure she would come to love you. :]|`|CPBstHUiaa	ive been through the exact same thing dude and it worked out for me so go for it dude|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well i think she really likes you she should brake up with her man and be with you|`|FYSkqcjhaa	Dude she with him for a reason and not you. She likes being treated like s**t sometimes because it's sexy when a man takes control. Im sure he is nice to her when no one is there. Guys like you who are always nice either get the women right away or you get on their friends list for almost eternity. If you do get her she'll just leave you for some badass guy who's sometimes nice. 17 is a time to have fun and screw around not be in a relationship dude|`|65ojSBXgaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Wow you sound very sweet and caring so my answer is...its a possibility she might like you because you do things for her that that other jerk wouldnt do you make her smile you have fun and all these things are planted in her heart. So I know she thinks of you when she feels alone and sad. Its only a matter of time before she realises she's fallin for you. Keep it up dont give up hope and watch for the day she will break free and fly to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Gail Friend|`|rz4sjxWBaa	OMG u wrote her a song how sweet!!!<br>  well it sounds like u two definately have a connection but for sum reason she is attached to her bf i dont get y she hasnt broke up with him yet<br>  but anyway u need to listen to ur heart n if ur heart is telling u to pursue her then by all means DO IT!!!<br>  either way whether she turns u down or not b proud of yourself that u took a chance n put ur heart out<br>  but by the looks of it if u tell her what u really feel i doubt shed reject u ;)|`|BOuPi3wDaa	I'd say she really likes you.  Loves you, even.  I've done some of those same things when I like someone.  If you like her, go for it!  Don't wait or you might lose her!  She's probably been waiting for you to let her know you like her so that she won't feel bad about leaving her boyfriend!|`|v4y1Uldiaa	She def seems to like you, but you yourself needs to explore what kind of love that is. She is obviously trapped in a relationship that she needs to get out of, maybe she is curious to know if you will be there for her when she does leave that guy. Either way  there is some kind of love there|`|cM9DBbgnaa	go for it and ask her out!!!!1 xD
eEu3zbVTaa	Well the mother of the bride is never supposed to throw a wedding shower.  Generally it is the Maid of Honor who throws a shower.  Either her or the other bridesmaids.|`|AA10447677	Maid of honor & other bridesmaids..|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Maid of Honor plans and all bridesmaids chip in to share the costs.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	The Maid of Honour. That's basically her main duty.|`|pLGsFF4Waa	Maid of Honor if you have one, if not then head bridesmaid can do it.|`|1l04qpOKaa	Maid of Honer should step up...  :o) Mother of bride should accept it, it's not her life|`|AA11380378	Not you or your mom. Typically, the maid of honor or the bridal party, a friend, a coworker or even yoru in-laws<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Technically, the mother of the bride is never supposed to throw the shower anyway, regardless of how she feels about the wedding.  It's considered kind of bad form to have any close relatives throw a shower for you.  The shower is usually thrown by the members of the bridal party (bridesmaids and MOH), or by a somewhat distant female relative (like a beloved aunt or cousin)|`|29I8PWrxaa	The maid of honour or bridesmaids throw it.  As a bride, you should not throw one for yourself though ... that's why your attendants do it.|`|LLUAaQR7aa	maid of honor, I hope she is not hiding behind something.... trying to get out of paying for it. cause if she is, drop her..  or perhaps excuses. excuses..|`|Sk12do0Xaa	the Maid of Honor or any other of the bridemaids
R7b150Iyaa	For a July wedding, you would send out invitations in May (depending on when in July your wedding is, beginning, middle or end, send it during the same time in May).  If anything, you would be very early if you sent them now, people would put them aside and forget.<br>  I'm getting married on April 17th and we sent out invites 2 weeks ago.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|bQCfOftxaa	well, i'm getting married April 18th and we sent out invitations out about 2 wekks ago.  i think it's normal to send out invites about 2 months before the wedding.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	no its not too late, you should be fine, i'm getting married in exactly 1 month and 29 days and still havent sent mine out or even gotten them,|`|gIqRs5buaa	That still gives people a reasonable amount of notice so i think you'll be OK. Anyway you don't have much of a choice so I would get those invites out ASAP!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	actually it's way too early.  you need to mail the invites so they're received 8 weeks out.  subtract 2 mos from your wedding date, that would be may.  May is 2 mos from now!  chill!|`|w1necKzYaa	nope you should send them out like NOW but if you don't get them till next month send them asap!
BHyIl8pJaa	I have to answer this the way I do my dog when I can tell it is about to do something bad....no no.<br>  Have more respect for yourself.  Giving up your virginity at that age is not a plan of action.  If you feel like the only way a certain guy will like you is by having sex, then he's probably not the right one for you.<br>  My advice...enjoy your life, don't rush, you'll have plenty of time for this when you are older.  Talk to your parents about how you feel and what you have contemplated, they will respect you more for being honest and can give you the best advice for your situation. Elders haven't been respected throughout history for nothing, they have "been there, done that".|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Wait until you are older to have sex.  Don't cheapen yourself and do it in movie theaters.<br>  Wait until you are in love, head over heels.  Not only will you be able to respect yourself more, you will have better sex if you wait for the right one.  Then do it romantically, responsibly and respectfully.  It will be beautiful and worth the wait if you do.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	i dont not believe that kids should be having sex at all at that age.<br>  at that age, sex can be more than trouble in so many ways to such an immaturely developed sense of self.  <br>  <br>  but i am certainly for kids that age to try and make friends of the opposite sex even to the point of being called a player...as long as there's no real hanky panky going on.  this way, the boy or girl gets a chance to interact with their counterpart in healthy ways and encourage good bonds.  of course, if one is going about it in the wrong manner, it could prove to be detrimental.  <br>  <br>  seek to be friends and form good relationships with the opposite sex.  that kind of experience may help you to seek certain characteristics in a partner later in life.|`|3iljgiZRaa	I was a month from 15th birthday when I first had sex... I had done everything else with the guy up to that point. I even knew then that I was way too young - I knew it was too soon... but there was some kind of unspoken pressure... it was hard to deal with. I did love the guy - very much in fact - but of course, it didn't work out, and after we split I had nothing left to give (or at least that's how I felt). He had taken all of my "firsts" including my virginity. I felt tainted, used and stupid. I did stuff with my other boyfriends because I kind of felt like I had already done it anyways, so what's one more guy? <br>  <br>  Now I am married and I have had four other partners besides my husband. I wish with everything in me that I had saved myself for my husband. It is something you can never get back once it's gone... a girl I worked with back in high school told me that she felt bad for me because, in her words: <br>  <br>  "I can choose to NOT be a virgin any time I want - - but you can NEVER be a virgin again."<br>  <br>  It's been nine years since the girl told me that and I STILL remember it to this day.<br>  <br>  14 is WAY to young. Enjoy the simple things in life - - you will have plenty of time to complicate things with "stuff" later on!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	First of all, what do you mean by "doing stuff"? If you are too immature to say it, you clearly should not be doing ANYTHING.<br>  <br>  All you need to be doing is homework!|`|jWO10NN5aa	People do all sorts of stuff everywhere all the time so I don't see why you are so concerned about this.|`|VrjF986Aaa	I just hope I'm not sitting next to them in the theater|`|Xka2R4EJaa	That's horrible! that is way too young! I work at middle school and most kids at that age are all talk or think they should do stuff because everyone talks about that sort of thing. my advice don't do anything you're way too young besides guys like girls that are nice and clean not dirty and slutty and trust me at that age a boy will spread rumors. way too young for a negative label! don't give in guys will appreciate and respect you more! =)|`|lnp9w4xfaa	Personally, i think that you're way too young and you should enjoy life the way it is now. Those people who are your age are just immature, they're trying to get rid of their childhood, knowing that they are still a child. I am 16 myself, and i havent done anything like that. So i wouldnt worry if i were you, just sit back, relax, enjoy life. Wait for the right person to come along... but seriously... that such a long time away you're only 14.... i mean... what happens if a girl gets pregnant at FOURTEEN?! Do you know how much of a disgrace that would be? Well, at least i think so, I mean, you're wayyy to young. Hell, im way too young.|`|rvLzngQ6aa	Just go for it.  Sex isn't all that special, I mean every male has the same sexual organs.  Every female has the same sexual organs.  If you've seen one you've seen them all.  And anyone can have sex, so don't think you're special.  Its going to happen any way, so just go for it.  Once you get your first time out of the way, you'll feel better.<br>  <br>  I'm a guy who lost my virginity to a prostitute at 19, and now I'm messed up for life.  All I can think of is paying for sex.  I wish I had the opportunity to have sex at a younger age, then I'd be better off.  The sooner a girl wants to have sex with you the better.|`|JqA5x1qiaa	I have just turned fifteen and I think it is totally stupid, I am 15 now and am glad i have not made any stupid decisions, i do well at school and i am rather popular and normal, their is no need to do stuff when you can have a normal teenage life without it.<br>  <br>  <br>  :) Livee lifeee|`|V5CRGK86aa	You have your whole life to be sexual. Please wait until you're a little older, and in a stable relationship. Trust me you will regret it later in life. You are still young, enjoy your youth while you can!!|`|rz4sjxWBaa	dont<br>  youll regret it trust me<br>  ur little brains cant even wrap around everything that physically n mentally goes along with from doing "stuff"|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well yea thats good just dont have sex okkk|`|6YrRxeVkaa	Are you talking about sexual things?  If so... I want to say that sexual feelings are absolutely normal, and no one should feel ashamed to have them.  However, I'm willing to bet that 90% of the people your age that are doing "stuff" are only doing it because they feel like "everyone is doing it."  <br>  <br>  Let it be a personal choice, don't just do it to jump on the "stuff" bandwagon.  Having sex is a big decision, and can come with big reprucussions.  Feelings for someone that you can't shake, possible pregnancy, STDs or other infections.  I'm not saying this to scare you, I'm just saying it so that you are aware.<br>  <br>  Have sex with someone you care about.  Because you will never forget them, and you will never forget your first time.  So make sure it's a memory you want to remember.  And, (from experience), wait a couple years.  In the long run, you, and all the be people you know, will be thankful they waited.|`|VgHU5b70aa	I think you're getting way ahead of yourself. You can live your life to the fullest without doing "stuff." These other kids are making a bad choice and could end up hurting themselves. You may think this is cool and will bring up your reputation but your just hurting yourself and if you get too "carried away" then you could hurt your partner and family too. I think this is a bad decision and it could ruin the good future you have ahead of you. I can't stop you from doing this but I hope my advice helps you.|`|c62dd304bac916a0f0b3ead296d41785aa	I have heard that things like that happen in the movies and it makes me scared for my daughter. I think it's horrible and young girls need to know that those boys don't respect you. You are just something to play with and see you as nothing. The worst thing you can do is bring yourself to that level. Have respect for yourself and please don't do it.|`|pfisYml0aa	i lost my virginity at 13, but was "messin around" at like 11, or 12. now that i m older, and have kids of my own, i think that it is way too young!! i look back, and realize how little i really knew about the world around me. but back then, i thought that i was really cool, and that i knew what i was doing. my advice is to wait.....but if you d0nt, please just be careful, and use protection.|`|zog4pnOuaa	The movies thats nasty<br>  I mean nobody can stop you frm doin wat you feel like doin<br>  i  feel if thats wat u wanna do then go ahead n do it <br>  just not in public places thats nasty and sluty<br>  but keep it safe and make sure you think it thru before doing ANYTHING<br>  you might regret <br>  trust me|`|xAKf7cEZaa	Your way way too young...just because everyone is doing it doesn't mean you should....you need to wait until you find a guy who really likes you and you like him....trust me if it ends up being with the wrong guy you will regret it later down the road...i would at least wait a few years or at least till your 17 or 18...it's no rush...don't jump into something your not ready for...|`|lStzkFTbaa	bwhaha. <br>  <br>  Well, I guess I did at that age.

But talk to him.  If you're honest, then he'll understand where you're coming from.|`|AA11963278	To be honest, I don't think so.

QZ1siB8Qaa	You have to consider this for the long run. Why did you drop out of college? Was it because your grades were slipping, too much partying, working too much to pay bills? If you answered yes, to any of those quesstions, you may want to think about moving in with parents. Don't want to repeat what has already happened. People are faced with difficult decisions all the time, some have to move back in with parents til they get back on their feet. Its perfectly normal. Parents are there to help, so reach out and take what they are offering and in the end, you will have saved money to move out after graduation, money to spare, and more time/less worries to allow you to focus on college. <br>  Good luck!!|`|9zM6QFEOaa	its not about pride its about finishing school.<br>  you should move in with your parents it will make school that much easier. <br>  and if you want you can look for the cheapest apt. you can find, it doesn't matter how little ugly or bad it is as long as its cheap.then if anyone asks were you live you can tell them your renting this cheap apt. till you finish school. and if you ever need some privacy or a place to party or just hang out you can go there . but still have all the luxeries of living in a nice house with your parents.|`|8v2AbHHsaa	if they want you back then go ahead.|`|R5IAmQAVaa	How much is your pride worth?  <br>  <br>  I was in a VERY similar situation myself.

Its something that I'm proud of and really makes me appreciate how hard I worked more than if I would have taken the easy road.<br>  <br>  I don't regret my decision one bit.

I admire you for getting over the past and getting your life back on track<br>  <br>  xxx...hope I helped = )|`|TyFBrelcaa	Well that's great to hear that your turning your life around , but you have to prove to your dad that he has changed and that will take time.|`|7urRIYMbaa	hmm, i think you should find someone that makes you happy.<br>  forget what everybody else says.<br>  <br>  <br>  and my myspace shouldn't be private,,just click on my pictures and it'll let you look.<br>  i am the girl with the striped shirt on..short hair..<br>  thanks.<br>  <br>  and good luck!<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  paige.|`|DyHpuiR8aa	Invite your dad along.  You're mature now - you have to be, given you're a mother now.  <br>  <br>  Your father, of course, will object - but he needs to understand that this man is the father of his grandchild, and if you want to try and make it work with him, he should support you.<br>  <br>  Your child should be your best interest and your father should know that - if there is a chance to reunite a couple with a child together, it should be taken up on.<br>  <br>  Take your father along too, so that he can see how much he has changed.  Everyone makes mistakes in the past (as you said - even you made a few) so how can your father be so against this one man?<br>  <br>  In the end, however, he's your father.  You have your own child now - you're responsible for his upbringing.  If you want the father involved, you go ahead with it - your father shouldn't stand in the way of that.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|YWe5fYAhaa	The difficulty is if you are living in your father's house then your boyfriend obviously wouldn't be able to go there to see you, other than that given that you're a mother yourself, I don't really see what say anyone else has in who you do or do not see. If it really would cause problems though I guess you'll just have to wait until you get you're own independence, i.e. your own place, and then you can see who you like. Perhaps if your boyfriend went to speak to your family and showed them that he had changed then they might be more willing to accept him, but it would probably take time for this to happen.<br>  Well done by the way for continuing your education, I had my daughter at 17 and I'm now in university so it can be done! Don't listen to people who tell you otherwise and you can be so proud of yourself for giving your child the future they deserve when you finally do make it. x|`|dP37ygplaa	I no this is not the answer you are relly looking for but the best info I would give any one is that just take your time and use google and just try useing different meanings and word and senses in google and you will get the info in the end just dont give up.|`|Q3NM0StNaa	i think you need to talk to your dad heart to heart and explain to him fully the situation. Also try to  get your dad to meet him for an hour.<br>  <br>  remember it must have been heartbreaking for your dad to see you do these things and going through them. he thinks its his job to protect you. - and he couldn't.<br>  <br>  if he's unreasonable you have to judge the situation yourself and risk whether your father feelings will be strong enough for you to give up this guy that you like.
lwXGNizGaa	Well, first of all, you need to make her explain why it was she was leaving you and don't let her BS you.  Get the truth about what made her want to leave in the first place otherwise the same thing could keep happening and she might not keep coming back.<br>  <br>  Then you need to decide if you even want her back now that she's left.  I mean, is someone who could leave you so easily the kind of person you want to have a huge emotional investment in?  She didn't get away this time but what about next time?<br>  <br>  Next, make sure she knows how you feel about what she did to you. Were you broken up?  Did it hurt when she left.  Tell her.  It's dirty to guilt someone into sticking around but at least she'll know you care and she deserves to know what she did to you.<br>  <br>  Finally, after you're done judging and if you decide you want her back and you're content with the other steps don't harp on this situation forever.  Obviously, forgetting about it would be foolish but don't bring it up all the time.  That's counter-productive and will just remind her how easy it was to leave last time.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	I, would say she missed her ride and came back to you. There is a cab on every corner.|`|jxizzHL1aa	Try as she might but she can never resist my charms.  They're magically delicious|`|zBC6n34Naa	Not enough information to formulate a practical answer.|`|78GfHPEKaa	She is just like every other woman...they drive you nuts...the key is to find the one that doesn"t|`|tpioRQHkaa	shes just confused.<br>  she has no idea if she should stay or go.|`|Bzjm8eoiaa	i think it was just her being confused, or she may have went for a one night stand, and she broke up with you to say that you werent together at the time it happened|`|PXN7r0RRaa	she's confused.. or something..
CZg79Qy9aa	Kids don't tell, because they are SCARED.  If this is/was happening to you....you need to tell someone.  Its not going to be easy, but you need to.  This shouldn't happen to ANYONE.  Kids don't ask to be put in this position and shouldn't have to be.  This happened to my niece who was 7 by a friend of her older brothers and she told.  She didn't know what was going on at the time...only that he was playing a "game with her" that hurt her.  It wasn't easy for her or her mom, but she is in counseling and doing better.  I think kids don't tell, because in their minds...they somehow blame themselves...or the abuser threatens to hurt/kill them if they do.  Its bull.|`|BImAj5WIaa	Maybe they are warned not to say something or something bad wil happen to them or someone close to them|`|1SrMF55Daa	I had answered your question, Honey I'll be more than happy to answer it again. In high school, I went through something really horrible. Its going to be the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, but believe me, people will surprise you, it will open the door the help you need.  You don't say anything because of the fear in their reaction. You aren't the one who needs to feel ashamed. Your abuser needs help. If you don't say anything, they could continue doing it to another innocent person  So here's what you do. You find the one person in your life that you truly trust. Write them a letter explaining everything. I did that when I had to tell my parents. Who you tell may be shocked, but they will help you. The ball is in your court, you're in control, your abuser isn't. Use it to your advantage and help yourself. Also, there are several victims programs you can attend, often times, there are advocates there that can help you and you're family. God bless you, please do something right away.|`|8sWaWQWGaa	First of all adults are sometimes  immature. Tell someone anyway so that person can stop and suffer the consequences. If they don't believe you tell the authorities you can pick up the phone and let somebody know. It do not matter how people look at you or what they say. That person is the one who has been doing wrong they deserve everything that is possible to happen to them, they are sick people you are the one who can stop this only you the sooner the better and the process of healing and getting your life on the right track starts. Don't be ashamed other people have gone through the same thing  its how you handle it that matters and what you can do to move forward to rebuild your life. If you cant tell write a letter to them and let them know exactly whats going on  please you should not have to go through this you have your whole life ahead of you.|`|e2099d20a6fdd2c84c032e222b17db4faa	One of the main reasons is that kids don't think they will be believed if they do tell.  Another reason is adults tell them not to tell. Some times the trust is not there, a parent or adult might think trust is there, but the child does not.  <br>  <br>  These are some I can think of right off the bat.  There could be others.|`|zbkIRP8Aaa	kids have friends they tell that stuff to, and even if your a trusted adult, its still kinda akward telling adults those things. Besides, if they dont want to tell you then they dont just make the kid feel comfortable, take he/she dinner or movies or something.
iKCj8zBjaa	sometimes its a bullying issue but sometimes when in relationships it's a friendly thing<br>  <br>  if relationship it's someone subconsiously sayin they like u<br>  <br>  personally i'm not too big on it, it makes me feel really self-consious. but some ppl r cos they think it's cute. or something like that|`|8v2AbHHsaa	May be because you have beautiful healthy hair, so you should be flattered that everyone is interested in your hair.|`|FgjhjRxZaa	If its my bf, I like it!<br>  When me and my friend are in bed (not in a lesbian way, just that I only have one bed so she has to share!) she sometimes twirls my hair around her fingers, I don't really mind that too much either. <br>  But if I don't know them, I don't like it!|`|5ia2JbrNaa	omg same! i really HATE people touching my hair! i spend bloody ages in the morning spiking it, straightening it, using hair spray.. then people just TOUCH IT :@  Lol.. but i dont mind it when my boyfriend does it, he like, plays with with the ends, wrapping them around his fingers.. i like that.. but other people touching it, i feel like yelling "F**K OFF!"   :L xx|`|cFPmlfXkaa	i think it is ok for like family, very close friends, and your boyfriend to touch it....but people just randomly walkin up and touchin it is weird and annoying!|`|hid5HDqfaa	Yeah I hate it when people do crap to my hair.|`|gaZ5CJw6aa	i like it when my friends or boyfriend or my mom are comforting me or something ..and they play with my hair <br>  <br>  but other than that i hate it..<br>  it makes me annoyed|`|HQ4t7JfGaa	dammm    <br>  i thouch my girls hair all the time and yet i wonder y she dont smile some girls dont like it emm ok <br>  <br>  NEW TIP IN MY BRIAN|`|Mapm6AI8aa	problems, girl...|`|aGAdZSNDaa	lol i could care less
PKsldf8Caa	I know how you feel...I'm exactly like that. If I see someone I know at my church or just somewhere else, I'll be all, hi, how are you, etc, but if I see that person at school, I won't even barely look at them. People don't quite know what to make of me. So, you're not alone :)|`|eO4y3m1maa	I was like that in high school, honestly I think I just felt more mature then anyone at school. I didnt fit in..and all i wanted to do was finish and go home.|`|DjMTnSxmaa	you must be my twin XD well there is one difference tho!<br>  I′m crazy at school and after school i′m really quiet.|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Oh yes.. everyone has multiple personalities.  Let it not bother u.. have fun outside and stay calm in school.. thats actually perfect.
ki42DNTpaa	just try to talk to her i am shy to but i am a girl and i hate being shy and everytime i go to talk to someone its like i cant speak well anyways like i said just try to go up to her and say hi and just start a conversation.|`|EgzoiW4raa	Its hard to approach a girl when you are shy.  I understand your dilemma.<br>  <br>  There is no right answer, but there are several approaches that may help  ease you into the situation.  <br>  <br>  1. Find common ground.<br>  This will help put you more at ease. What does she like? Where is she from? Do you both eat at the same place?<br>  <br>  2. Plan you approach.<br>  Now that you have found similar interest ask her about it.  be genuinely interested and listen to her.<br>  <br>  3. Realize<br>  Realize that girls are just as nervous as you and that they are attracted to confidence in a man.  So by you having the "guts" to walk up and talk to her.  You are instantly MORE attractive than form across the room!  Not bad, huh?!<br>  <br>  4. Act<br>  "You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"  I think you will find that once you initiate a conversation, things will flow much better than you anticipated.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Dr. Chambers|`|juSJrU4waa	you need to have confidence - and no matter what stay positive and don't say a mean thing. Show no fear or the fear will own you and you'll get nowhere.<br>  Spark up any random conversation and ask for her number later on. Need more info after this, send me a PM.|`|Q5jypS3Gaa	Just talk to her..If u've never talked to her before what do u have to loose right? just keep an open mind and positive thoughts..Girls appreciate bravery..Trust me i know! We dont bite we are nervous creatures too!! Good Luck|`|PTv7k1Hlaa	Start Talking to her like on Msn, Bebo, Myspace, Facebook, Tag ect!<br>  and then build up a relationship and get to know her then you will soon end up talking to her face 2 face x|`|0LwWZALYaa	stop being lazy the answer is not going to fall out of the sky get off yahoo answers and go have a convo with her|`|uFJdh913aa	Learn some grammar and don't be shy. Talk to her and or friends of hers.|`|WgQyGnrxaa	Umm..... learn English... haha<br>  <br>  But seriously, girls like shy guys, just be honest with her!|`|d55czOsQaa	Aww thats cute (:<br>  <br>  Talk to me ;) im a girl and single,you never knoww you might like me ...|`|SqNoMz7vaa	Stop being shy, what can I say.|`|AA11275418	talk to her somehow...jus say hi and ask a Q|`|nr1Bt47baa	Open your mouth and speak. How do you speak to anyone?|`|ByVkqiSCaa	tell her a joke, like why did the peanut cross the road.|`|JbFToTMdaa	kinda need some more info... like does she know you exist? did you just start in the same class or what?... anyway just talk to her like you talk to guys|`|mJDqKejtaa	yeah u can always write a note first and give it to her and pass them back and forth|`|af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	You shall use your mouth for talking to the girl.|`|PhKzejntaa	Write a letter asking her if you can talk to her.|`|6ad1dc296ecb7c905f1e7277c442d32baa	jsut say hey you look pretty and have a smile on you face.  then say do you want to do hw together and then when you have the time and moment then be like so what course are you taken for an allective.  do you like it?  do you have a job?  what funny thing happened at the job.  and to be honest even though you hear thingas abpout this person doesn't mean that you are going to really like her when you talk to her.  that happens alot when you talk to her maybe people think of her as something she is not.|`|UGAZhGqJaa	listen, quit being a fag and go up and talk to the chick like a real man. ask her to go out to the movies with you some night or something kool like that she will like it and all that good suff.|`|Akdsu4nFaa	it is very easy just walk in front of her and drop a pencil or something! and if she doesnt pick up the pencil then all you should do is try to start something then and there and mean grow some balls|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Find something that you have in common and run with it. That will lead to other topics and pretty soon you have yourself a friend. And every TV dad since Mr. Cunningham back on Happy Days was right: just be yourself!|`|qcIfeNFXaa	Depends on what kind of person she is and you gotta be your own man about this kind of thing, how else will you get anywhere in life?|`|zWB3jHHPaa	you can start by saying hey how's it going?|`|2mYY0O5uaa	start by saying hi|`|goo7zzqWaa	just be yourself
CZg79Qy9aa	Do you want to live with your dad?  Do you feel a little betrayed by your mom?   Why can't you go with her and her new husband?  You could travel with them and see the world.  You could be home schooled and still finish school and meet new people all over the place.  SOunds like your mom has her head in her butt.  If you do HAVE to live with your dad...  I am sure you will make friends easily.|`|XGx9WORLaa	that sucks! I am so sorry. Will your mom let you go with her and be home schooled? If so I would take that option. If not I would say screw her and go live with your dad. You might be able to get emancipated at 16 in your state though. Check out the laws. If that's the case maybe you can move in with a friend or a friends parents can take guardianship of you. I would explore those options. good luck. Wherever you end up I am sure you will be happy one way or another and you will make friends quickly|`|7iEk06aDaa	I don't understand why your mom would make such a life changing decision for you. I mean, my god, that's like unbelievable. But you know what? You will adjust and find new friends and it will all work out in the end. When your 18 you will have the choice to move back to the states if you want. Make the best of it, enjoy the fact that not many kids your age have the opportunity to visit and experience the luxury of traveling to another country. I think your lucky to have this experience under your belt.
LtMGBsI2aa	It sounds like she's unsure of you.  It's clear that she's into you but she doesn't want to get serious with a person who is just going to hurt her.  It kind of sounds like she's testing you to see if you really like her.  <br>  <br>  By her telling you she's not sure if you have a future and that if you can't wait then don't, she is pretty much saying right here that she doesn't trust you yet and if you aren't willing to work to gain her trust then don't try.<br>  <br>  You messed up with telling her you didn't want to know her.  It sounds like you were starting to get somewhere and that just brought you two steps backwards.  She got mad at you because she likes you and you pretty much told her that you didn't want to wait for her to build up a trust in you.  <br>  <br>  Her kissing you when she was drunk is just further proof that she's into you.  The alcohol brought her defenses down and for that moment she acted as she truly wants to be able to act with you but you're the only person who can make it work with the girl.  It you really like her tell her that you are willing to give her as much time as she needs...you aren't going anywhere and you don't want to be with anyone else.  Granted it helps if what your saying it true.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're getting in your own way.  Just be patient and give her the time she needs.  She likes you, the question is are you willing to wait form her defenses to come down so that she's willing to show it without booze?<br>  <br>  Good Luck man!|`|7qvaXOFzaa	well, her behaviour is probably like this with you because you slept with another girl a month ago.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	GET OUT AND RUN!!!!!!!!!!
UwQPH7eHaa	"I was drunk, but she didn't seem worried about me getting a dui or in an accident."<br>  <br>  I'd be pretty pissed about this. For the record, you shouldn't be driving drunk regardless of what a woman does. Get a taxi or a hotel. <br>  <br>  If she acts like a B when you go to her house, I wouldn't be in any rush to go back over there. Once someone kicks me out of someplace, I don't feel the urge to ever go back.<br>  <br>  Call her and tell her how you feel. Don't expect her to be truly sorry, few people who act like this really are.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	You got a crazy chick! And I hope I don't drive on the same roads as you two duiers cause I have two babies and if a drunk was driving and killed one or both of them they had better hope that god takes me too! Why don't you just break it off with her and find someone who's not so weird?|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Definitely wait for her to contact you. You don't want to stir the pot at all. Just let her simmer in her own juices for awhile. She'll come around. <br>  <br>  One way or another it'll all work out.|`|C8opQMAVaa	confront her, and then be done with her.  obviously something is bugging her.|`|xGI9z01Maa	Women are weird.  Something is up and she wants to tell you but she is not sure how.  You should call her and tell her that you would like to talk.  You have to sit down with her and see what is up.  It might be as simple as she is still upset about the fight and you have not talked it all out.  Or it might be that she wants to break it off and is not sure how to do so.  Or she might be pregnant and afraid to tell you.  Or it might even be something that has nothing to do with you personal, her mother is sick, she might not have a job soon, etc.  <br>  <br>  But being childish and playing game with texting is not going to get you answers or help the situation.  You need to talk it out.  If it starts to get heated.  Take a second and count to 10.  If that does not work go to 20.  and keep counting.  Words can be forgiven but never forgotten.|`|6jgjZEB2aa	I guess you better get down and talk to her; maybe she really had some work the next day, she does care for you and that is why she called you over again.<br>  <br>  Drop the hard feelings, Life is short.<br>  <br>  Wish you all the best.|`|bsSEC6Ozaa	Maybe you should call her yourself and confront her about it. You said that she wasnt herself that night anyways so maybe somethings going on, which made her not realize what she was doing...?|`|onrcmQf8aa	If that is your girl, then you need to confront her.  Communication is the key.|`|aehDH3Maaa	wait untill she calls. she needs 2 bugde first n say sory 4 treatin u like sh*t|`|nVuOYHC7aa	Be mature about the situation.<br>  Call Her and Tell Her How you feel. If She gets pissed off, Then it's her fault. Never settle for less than you deserve. You seem like a nice guy, and she pretty much just blew you off for sleep. She was probably lying about working, since she went out to drinks with you. She's Using you, Take it from a Woman's point of view. Time to get a new Girl.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	My boyfriend DIED and so DID HIS WHOLE FAMILY- all by drunk drivers -<br>  ON SEPERATE INCIDENTS/OCCASSIONS.  <br>  <br>  You have no idea of the heartache....<br>  <br>  So, you are correct in that your gf was selfish in asking/telling you to drive drunk, but you are also a moron for doing it.  <br>  Not once but 3 times that evening.  <br>  You weren't worried about driving drunk when you left the sushi bar and drove home with her in the car-  than why were you suddenly worried when it was time to leave her house?  And why did you turn around?  And why did you leave again?  You're both idiots for the drunk driving.<br>  <br>  As far as your girlfriends attitude/deMEANor that evening towards you, I wouldn't accept that if I were you.  She was cold and insulting towards you and then played with your emotions.  No, I wouldn't call her, or even want her.  When somebody kicks you out of their house TWICE- I'd say it's time to have some self respect and decide on your own that you are not going back.<br>  <br>  I hope you find a taxi in the yellow pages and a new love in that order.
4nSGT0Yvaa	It might be hard, but if she doesn't see you in this way, just block her out.

They were afraid of not getting a reply...and that would hurt!  However, for the awesome friends that made the first move and wrote to them, they are still friends...and they are in their 20's now!  <br>  <br>  My kids, especially my daughter, it was like a death of a friend when we moved!  If she got no reply it was devastating!  So, after a while, she would not write/call first!<br>  <br>  Text, write or email...and be a friend...maybe for life!  The fact that you are asking means that you want to anyway!|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	yes, u should|`|DsFFjBtOaa	yes but make sure to remember that if you send a letter and dont get one back, to remember to think, how busy her life is in that other country where she doesnt know anyone. <br>  <br>  BrIaNnE|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Keep in touch thru myspace and facebook.. it's not that difficult these days.. or u can even do the traditional thing and write long letters .. they are faaaar better than mails coz they have a personal touch.|`|3rVr9tcEaa	Yes<br>  Keep In Touch <3|`|5tbFuG1Maa	nothing|`|AA12280249	well if you want to be her friend then its totally worth trying even though shes far away but if shes not putting any effort into her friendship then don't waste your time on somebody that doesn't care what happen to your friendship or she might just be adjusting her new life in a new home.|`|8iZU6zd5aa	maybe she hasn't had time. give her a chance. i say keep in contact. she is a good friend you don't wanna lose a good friend even if she is in another country.|`|RTZvxTH5aa	She hasnt given you any reason to stop being her friend. You may see her again one day, and imagine how awesome it would be to know you guys held on to your friendship for so long.|`|8S1vEESYaa	You'll regret if you dont give your friendship everything that you have...
NtCya5NYaa	yeah that seems a little weird..why does she matter? i wouldnt make a big deal about it though unless he starts talking about her and her new car all the time...|`|Bm4cPW8naa	Well talk to him about it... there could be something wrong there or you could be just..as you put it lol.. trippin... I have learned from my own insecurities to just ask that way you don't spend hours and hours analyzing and jumping to the wrong conclusion
JwNZ7kK5aa	Advantage of being the oldest = you get to beat everyone up.<br>  Disadvantage of being the youngest = you get beaten up all the time.|`|AA12346188	Eldest gets the responsibility of somebody fast and loses his/her childhood for nothing.<br>  Youngest gets all the love to become a spoilt child and later useless to the world.|`|cKwwt6xZaa	Well I'm neither so I don't know personally but here are some ideas:<br>  <br>  Oldest: Having to set an example, get things first-hand, had that time alone with parents, having to adjust to siblings, etc.<br>  <br>  Youngest: Get away with more, get things second-hand, may be babied more, gets picked on, etc.|`|QZ1siB8Qaa	Disadvantages of being the oldest: Your parents are new to parenting, so basically you are like a lab rat...They do what they think is right, make rules, etc. When another child comes along, they know what works and what doesn't, a lot of rules will be different, and perhaps you will seem as unfair. <br>  Advantages of being the oldest: Teaching a younger sibling about things in life, sharing memories, being that shoulder to cry on when things go wrong. Parents tend to spoil you. <br>  Disadvantages of being the youngest: Parents tend to refer to the oldest child's mistakes and make decisions based on that. Sometimes hand-me-downs take place....<br>  Advantages of being the youngest: Get away with a lot more
61eLCih3aa	Give him the cold F****** shoulder.  That will dirve him crazy.  Act like you only care about you and your baby and when he thinks he is losing you he will get his S*** together.|`|Bm4cPW8naa	Without a doubt talk to him about it... for the sake of you and the baby you should not be putting yourself under that kind of stress.. he may not like the conversation because he may feel like you are accusing him but you need to have that heart to heart|`|u8MOrhnvaa	It could be number of things, but you need to be bit selfish right now. You should think about yourself and your baby. Stressing o much while pregnant is not good for you or the baby.
vlCWp7sSaa	Oh no, a clique question.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't matter if they're skater or prep or even nerdy. Guys goes for girls that they are interested in and girls go for guys they are interested in.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Maybe they prefer dating people they like rather than judging people by their looks.|`|4dIWZCLGaa	Birds of a feather flock together, but they never date.|`|7akG7iRPaa	my opinion is that they see you more as one of the guys. im lke you i dont skate but i lke to do alot of guy things and thats usually who im with, and they all consider me on of them not some girl...  and really idk why they would go for preps thats just weird, (i dont lke them lol can ya tell)..|`|estIQEVNaa	I don't know.  A lot of preppy girls are into it.  And most of the time "skater girls" are boyish or sort of resemble themselves and they don't like it.|`|nGdH31Ucaa	i don't think guys like being with someone<br>  that is so much like them... a guy.<br>  <br>  does that make sense?|`|djAfkJTYaa	well..... the guys dont rly like when a girl is kinda like a guy!<br>  like the guys like it when the girl is girly....<br>  when i think of a skater i think a guy cuz of all the clothes but this guy... a skater... go figure... like me and i wouldnt rly say im preppy so u just have to find the right ones!|`|kQgSi1MEaa	Because they see the skater girls as people just to hang out, not gf material.  If they DO actually skate, there probably really tomboyish.  Most guys like girly-girls. We want to date a girl, not another one of the guys.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	cause there girly girls..|`|Nhyn7m50aa	preppy girls are the good girls!
Bh9MgUwJaa	How old are you...and how old is he?  Most importantly, this is most likely a crush and you should just have fun.  Also, remember that he's your brother's friend, and if something happened between the two of you that didn't end well, he's still probably going to be your brother's friend, which means you'll have to see him whether you want to or not.  My advice to you would be to keep him as your own personal fantasy and don't push anything.  If it's meant to be, it'll happen on its own terms.|`|jXIS4npBaa	try to get to kno him better and when your brothers with him join them and hangout.

Does NOT understand the female mystique in this day and age and the need for physical release as much as they experience?  I cannot imagine, truly...<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to buy the guy a real good and descriptive book ON SEX AND WOMEN.  He needs help and I'm not sure he's listening to you or you're able to explain, you don't say...<br>  <br>  Goodluck!<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I am fortunate enought that my husabnd is always more concerned with my needs then his own. but ia gree people on here only think about themselves. It is mostly men who think there women should wait on them, while there probalyl sittign at home without a woman in sight and wonder why.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Well, then grow up be a mature woman. Learn your own body and teach your husband what it is he needs to do to satisfy you. Any man who knows what to do in the bedroom was taught or informed by a knowledgeable female who was not ashamed of her own sexuality.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	wouldn't know me first|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You do but men just feel that their needs over rides yours and are more important. Men hae two basic needs; eat and sex and not necessary in that order. And both of those will eventually get him into trouble. Thats why the very first thing a women has to do in any relationship is set her man straight that her needs come first over his and if they dont, he can forget about his two needs (above). Once a woman sets her man staright on that fact, then everybodys happy and lifes a ball. Now if you miss your golden opportunity, any man then thinks hes the boss and the woman is his servant with no needs. Hope this makes sense|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Yeah, you just have to tell the man what it takes to get you there. If he's not willing then you have problems of another kind. I dated a man who told me he was willing to give as much as he was given! That man is now my husband.|`|88bDvyiwaa	I thought the female orgasm was a myth.|`|46aa1c87e59cea852f9c28d9773506f9aa	Maybe because we are not so vocal about it.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	I agree.  We have "needs" too.  Why does sex only work around the man's needs?  LAME|`|YzObEmUqaa	Who says we don't understand that aspect of women's needs?<br>  Yes, if your man knows how to please you.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	You're doing it wrong.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	You had the same two minutes we did.  Just like a woman, always has to have MORE than us guys and never satisfied..|`|eeCoeMZsaa	oh my i feel for you ladies that are in that situation<br>  <br>  my wife must do her thing before me (foreplay is a must) and i'm not done until she has another this keeps my wife only interested in me|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	sex & orgasms are directly linked to level of communication & bonding<br>  a couple has.

a1Ngi39Xaa	People change and grow apart.  I was married for 15 years and I thought we would last forever.  We had been through so much together.  We even separated for 8 months, got back together and tried again.  But it just didn't work.  We were just 2 people living in the same house.  In my case, my husband just didn't want to do anything with me or go anywhere.  He became very obsessed with money as well.|`|OUVUU5xRaa	People stop working at their marriage.  They grow apart and don't put in the time to keep the 'love' feeling alive.|`|Z6CJApzJaa	There are so many reasons for this but I think the number one thing is that people (overtime) forget why they fell in love with that person in the beginning. Everything stars to fade and then they just get tired or bored with each other leading to temptation from the outside. People change and there interests change as well. One couple could start out okay  then one wants more than the other and then their goals become conflicted. It's sad but true.|`|YMnTveWuaa	For me, the first failure was her. Drugs, caught her in my bed with an ethnic guy, etc.<br>  <br>  The second was her thing. She did not like my job and the fact I travel a lot, which I did when we met. But then she came back, because when she left I was never there.<br>  <br>  I had seriously considered not letting her back.<br>  <br>  That may have resulted in me being a Hostess. Which would not have been bad, of that I am sure.|`|1os95dHZaa	Cheating!|`|Di6FAQxRaa	i think there are many people who cant commit to one person, they like to cheat and have many lovers.|`|WhYTUzMuaa	love turns to ash when u start treated ur spouse or partner as granted,<br>  you start expecting and forgets to give those small appreciation which yuo always suppose to give when you were in love.

That is when he reaches full maturity.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't understand why you would want to wait to do something as fun as sex, but I certainly won't tell you it's "bad" to wait.  It's certainly being on the safe side, because if you don't have sex before marriage, you're 100% guaranteed to bring neither a baby nor an STD into your marriage.|`|AA11220327	do what is right for you and your beliefs.

It's YOUR body and you don't owe it to anyone else. You don't owe your virginity to your friends just because they threw theirs away. You can't ever do the "first time" again - make sure it's perfect before you do it. Make sure you love the guy and that he loves and respects you.

And if they give you any crap about it then tell them to mind their own business!|`|fGLHYL0yaa	You should never think "i'm going to do what others are doing" Being a virgin until marriage is a very precious thing.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with waiting. I think it is something to be respected.|`|rh1XoOhvaa	No it is not at all!<br>  <br>  You'll be proud of yourself.

f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	Be straight with men and give them very clear signals and even a frank talking to. Let the one whose friendship you value more as is clearly know that. Never beat around the bush or be wishy-washy if you don't want guys to still pursue you, but let him down easy and let him know you think he's a special friend but not a real love interest. Tell him that it would ruin a good friendship to become more involved with such a dear old friend like him. I would also think about the reasons why you had originally broken it off with your ex, too, before ever considering going back with him. Or did he leave you for the attentions of another girl? Ask yourself if you want your man dreaming of who he'd rather be with while you are playing second fiddle to that other girl, so to speak. A guy that really loves you wouldn't leave and come back like a yo-yo on a string, only when he's bored with not having that other girl or any other girl for whatever reason. You are also kind of young to worry about happily ever after just yet anyway. Perhaps you all need to mature more and it's just "Puppy-Love" right now. Don't get so hung up on the details at your young ages now. You can come away from these experiences with an understanding that you are a very likable girl and the guys are noticing you and think you are cool and desirable. Take your time and talk it out with both of them, individually, but before you do, think out how each makes you feel ahead of time and if you want that feeling to continue. I know a woman who divorced and ran off with her dream man, only to find out a few years later as she tossed him out and regretted what she gave up for just such a man who never EVER put her first! It was pure infatuation and not a reciprocal love. True love is a mutually caring and nurturing relationship for both partners. It is supposed to be, as the Bible puts it, "The two shall become one flesh". That doesn't mean that one consumes the other! Nor does it mean that one stifles or strangles the individuality of the other! It means that both individuals care deeply enough for each other that they are loving, giving, and even tolerant at times of the other's little idiosyncrasies to give themselves fully to sharing, and compromise while maintaining compassion, caring, and respect for both individuals. It is like a merger or a blending but not eliminating the original substance of either. I like to say love is a two-way street. It may never be exactly equal, but it should always seek to gravitate back to fairness and equality from both sides, because, after all, someone who really loves you would want you to have a lot of say in what you do together and what's important to each partner. Be careful and think with your heart and your head, too! Maybe neither of them deserve you and a really great guy will come along in your future. One who puts you first as his one and only special woman!|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	this is tricky. you don't want to hurt your best friend, but then again should you really take you ex back? I mean what did he do in the first place that broke you guys up? I think that you should talk to your guy friend and tell him that you should just stay friend even though guys hate those words. And f your ready to accept your ex back then do so, yet it will probably end soon. We can't tell you what do do. Its your heart in the end.|`|njbZT7twaa	Your Ex is an Ex for a reason...pick your best friend he will always be good to you.|`|LOuK0Ysiaa	Get bac with ur EX and tell ur BFF tht ur not interested ...tell him tht u two  were meant to be frnds and nothing else|`|5AhyCwihaa	hey jess. sounds like youre in the middle of a major pickle here. i can relate to your relationship problems...i want to get married to my bf but just dont know if its what he wantss. what i think you should do is forget all about your ex. he broke your heart once, why let him back?!?!?!?? youre just confusing yourself because your brains all messed up from what your bff just proclaimed to you.  what you should do about him: go out on a date or two and set aside some time for undisturbed intimicy with him. after that, if you really dont have any loving feelings towards him, just gently let him know. at least you gave it a shot. i mean, you probably shouldnt tell him you love him yet cause itll KILL HIM if he ever finds out it isnt true. as a fellow young teen, i feel that this is truely the best way to go.  good luckk! let me know how it works out.|`|AA11492911	Sweetie you answered your own question there.<br>  <br>   "one is my best friend and the other is my ex boyfriend i still have feeling for him and i am still in love with my ex so i =m in between. i don' love my friend i just see him as my friend."<br>   <br>  But if I may there is usually a reason you break up. Look closely at your relationship before you get back with you ex. And Your best friend can sometimes be the best boyfriend. Just some food for thought But keep this in mind make the decision based on what YOU want not how one or the other is going to feel. Sounds heartless but in the long run it will be less painful that way. Follow your heart.|`|B9OwRPSpaa	i was in the exact same situation as you.<br>  he was my best friend for a year and he told me that he was in love with me and i had no idea what to do.  i was in a shock because i did not expect this.  i did also still had for feelings for another guy but i knew we weren't gonna happen so i took a long think about goin out with my best friend.  i decided yes because i thought he really cares about me and i thought we would work out.  and it did and it was amazing but it was only just the other week we broke up because we were too busy.<br>  i'd say give it a shot, you never know, he may be the one.|`|CfPQwq3Qaa	This is what I would do.  Don't react.  Let it sit for a little time so that your thoughts are in order first.  I made a lot of mistakes at your age just because I reacted right away and didn't let it soak in first.  But you will need to tell your friend the truth.  It would hurt him and your relationship more if you don't.  So, get it over with soon.  You'll have to acknowledge his feelings though.  Things may be awkward with your friend for a bit, but if you both stick it out things will be okay.<br>  <br>  As for your ex, why is he your ex.  What were the reasons that you broke up?  What has changed?  There is nothing wrong with telling him that you need more time to think about it.  If for some reason he doesn't respect and accept that answer, then he may not be the one for your.  Remember, you may have a few more boyfriends in your lifetime.  Most people do.  So, it is okay to move on if that is what happens.  Life and love does go on and repeats.<br>  <br>  But no one can tell you what to do.  We can only give you advice.  Most high school romantic relationships don't last forever.|`|uBssj3Znaa	If you don't have feelings for your friend, then be honest and tell him so.

Tell him you do love him more then any intimate relationship you may have in the future or have had. A way in which you could never love another. You love him as your best friend. You love him because of that special relationship you now have. If it were not for that kind of love you have for him there would be a void in your heart. You would have lost your very best friend, someone to tell all your secrets to someone and the only one you can truly trust to always be there for each other. You may sound selfish, but you would hate the idea of loosing your very special relationship for what could be a temporary relationship. Once you step over the line. All your memories of him are only that. Just memories as you may never have that again. I, do love you because we are whom we are. Not many people have what we have. Not many can ever claim to have we have. We have the real deal. We have a bond no one can take from us ever. We have each other. Can we take a chance on ruining our special relationship for something that may have no future for either one of us. You are my friend my shoulder to cry on my everything. I, am counting on you to always be there for me and me for you. We are each others rock. I, don't want to skip that rock across the water and hope it does not sink when it comes to rest. I, want my rock to be a special place to rest my head when I am 64. When my intimate relationships fail to prove themselves. I, know you will always be my very special friend as you have always never failed me.|`|jofuVL9Baa	Well, it seems to me that regarding your friend, its pretty defined: you don't have other feelings for him other than a great friend.  As far as your boyfriend, or ex rather, you probably need to give this some time -without him- until you figure out how you really feel about him so as to not play with his feelings.  As far as your best friend, I'd be weary of messing up the good friendship, but don't shut that door sentimentally speaking.  Before you jump into anything with your friend, consider if he's "dating material" and who knows, maybe he's mr. right and you just didn't know it.  Sometimes you have to mess up before you get something right!  Hope this helps.  Good Luck!

If you ain't certain, don't make a move cause it casue a rift in your friendship wait intil she says anything or until you are really certain|`|hCmRyAggaa	Sounds like she likes you mate ;] <br>  If she continues to be so friendlly, flirty and complimentary then reciprocate, call her babe or wahtever you fancy. <br>  <br>  Don't bring up the subject of whether she likes you or not too soon, wait a while and see if you get any closer.<br>  <br>  But remember, be yourself, that's who she likes you for...|`|O7inFMXVaa	it seems like she likes you but it's better to talk to her about it to avoid misunderstanding|`|hizUz9rDaa	sounds like she likes you. talk to her about it|`|xWoJooeMaa	maybe shes just greatful for your help
WA9Y8QAEaa	well, she needs to let him know that it's not true, I mean you really shouldn't 'joke' about something serious like that in the first place :S maybe be there with her when she tells him so that she's not alone. <br>  Good luck!
EYt8H5N2aa	Is he on child support? If not, then that is why. He wants to make sure he does not get put on child support. Also, she can take his kids away from him anytime and he will not want that. Women can be so evil soemtimes.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Encourage him to get a legal visitation agreement. Good Luck|`|BjyXKFpRaa	You don't know all those kids might be his and he might be telling that they are somebody else just to make you happy. But anyway they might be still seeing each other and etc cause I don't know what man jump when his ex call. Better put up your guard.
VkzmH1GKaa	The truth is he was just out for the sex. Why? I would assume you are young and haven't realized that,  sex is the key with most men. For men we don't move past that basic concept until the right one or who we think is the right own arrives, sadly the rest are just being lied to for sex.|`|QIYHApEkaa	He got what he wanted or at least as much as you were willing to give up, and when he saw he wasn't going to get more he moved on, basically, he played you, used you and now moved on; sorry to be so brutal but the truth hurts, next time try not giving in to a guy unless you've, been with him for a while and know that he's going to stick around; How can you tell that? Just use your common scense or you'll get a reputation as a "pass around" weather you desrve it or not. Good luck|`|FFNIIMjvaa	Why would he bother staying around, you put out and now he's onto the next girl. No one wants to date a sIut, you're fun for a good night and then it's on to the next girl. Next time don't be such a tramp.|`|EYt8H5N2aa	I am not a guy but I will say that he just wanted one thing. Guys can be so selfish and do anything just to get at you sexually.
1k7LIZVWaa	Help her with her shoes and socks when she asks.....Seriously, a nice massage or a day at the spa would be wonderful and help her feel beautiful and refreshed.|`|0Id85yiYaa	relive your first date.|`|AA10986891	Send her a beautiful flower arrangement (www.1800flowers.com) and wgen you get home rub her feet, give her a back rub and from now on make her breakfast in bed before you leave for work.|`|AA11220327	it really is the small subtle things. I am currently pregnant, and my husband will text message me from work and ask how my belly is which i think is sweet, he will paint my toe nails because its hard for me to do when im pregnant. He gets me maternity sized lingerie, and loves me wearing it for him. And still tells me every day that he thinks i look sexy and beautiful. Those are the the things that i appreciate the most are the little things like that.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	In my experience, the best thing you can do is constantly remind her that she's beautiful.  Hormones will be running rampant and you won't see mood swings like this again until menopause. :)<br>  For something specific, treat her to a "spa day" - buy her a gift certificate for a manicure, pedicure, facial or whatever you know she likes and you can afford.  Follow it up with a nice romantic dinner - either at her favorite restaurant or time it so you cook and have it ready shortly after she returns.  Flower on the table, candles - go the whole nine yards.<br>  She'll love it....and you.<br>  Good luck!|`|cHiv6eTWaa	Lick her like a lollipop because she's to prego to bang her hard. And cook her a nice dinner before hand.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	A nice dinner, maybe a weekend away. Definitely a massage or facial, maybe a pedicure. She needs pampering and relaxation. Just spoil her with things you know she loves. If you can plan a mini-vacation before the baby arrives I'm sure she'd love it. It'll be a while before you're ready to travel with baby and I'm sure you could both use a break. Just pamper her and let her indulge. Women feel guilty about spending money on themselves sometimes and if you give her a 'spa day' as a gift I'm sure she'll love it.|`|UTb5chyJaa	I would say if you can afford it, take her away for the weekend and have one last romantic adventure before the baby gets here. it doesnt have to be someplace expensive just going to a different town can be exciting.make sure you give her a good massage and pamper her while your on your getaway. have fun!!!!|`|AA11208683	first off i want to say that is really sweet of you!! but as for my ideas, it depends on what she likes... i don't know her so here are a couple of suggestions. you could light candles in the bedroom and put on some nice soft music, and give her a body massage, ask what places are sore and softly rub them for her... or if she likes baths, get a warm bath ready and put like candles and music in there as well, and help her get in real nice, and ask her if she wants or needs any thing... kinda act a little like her servant. or you could make her favorite dinner, and dessert, offer her different things, and clean up afterwards... and when you guys go to sleep softly rub her arms or whereever she likes to be rubbed untill she goes to sleep... if she likes getting gifts you could get her something that you think she would like, even if its something small. or rent a good love movie, and the two of you sit on the couch and snuggle... and during all of this tell her how much you love her, and that she is beautiful... i hope this helps... good luck!! it all depends on what she likes, whatever you do make sure its from you, she will appreciate you making her feel good, than someone else making her feel good.... she will know you are trying and that you love her...|`|5brlJBGRaa	I would do something that yall did together when you first met, then take her home and give her a nice candel lit bath and message her feet. Just relaxing with her in the candel light and being in a nice warm tub....very very romantic to me... lol thats what my husband did and i looooved it. To this day he actually still does it every once in a while.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Take her out to dinner, then do something SHE wants to do (watch a movie, or somethng like that).<br>  And please, rub her feet. Pregnant women's feet hurt at the end of the pregnancy!!!|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i can tell you what not to do.<br>  <br>  do NOT draw a basketball on her tummy, while she's sleeping.<br>  <br>  lol.|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	rub her feet, she will greatly appreciate it.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	Get her a good message.|`|AA11761605	Spend an evening of just "her time" sing her favorite song (even if you may not be able to) while you're rubbing her feet or massaging another part of her body, make a cd of her favorite music and play it while you feed her, watch a great comedy movie (laughter is always good) and remind her how much you love and appreciate her, compliment her.  Congratulations on your son/daughter!
2WfHLUyOaa	nope thats obsession|`|xgJbxZgfaa	well not 24/7 but most of the time yeah =)|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well, of course in a relationship you wanna try to spend a good amount of time with your other half, but you don't have to spend all of it with them. Its actually healthy for you two to have some of your own interests, and to go out with friends on your own sometimes. If your always together, you'll run out of stuff to talk about. Just spend time together, but still go out and do things separately too once in a while. good luck.|`|EHMCgFCHaa	i would say yes<br>  <br>  it depends on the type of person you are<br>  <br>  if im going to spend the rest of my life with a person... i want them to be in my life every possible second we can be<br>  <br>  why would you want to be apart from the person that makes you whole?|`|Z6cZxI6naa	I think after a year or two of a relationship I would know if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. And yes I would.|`|AA12077420	spending all the time together might not be very healthy,you both need your space|`|LOuK0Ysiaa	My BF of two years is totally obsessed with me and wants to spend all his spare time with me ...I just told him tht we're at that point in our relationship where im secured and dont need to cling on to him, becuz i now tht he loves and and tht he will always want to be with me. My BF believes me and now i spend moderate amout of time with him, like 2-3 days a week, instead of 5-7 days a week. He knows we have college and work, and so he gives me the space. You compromise and no u shudnt feel like u HAVE to spend all of ur time. Tell the person tht if the spending of time is out of choice and not out of I HAVE TO, then it'd be more fun for u. Spending time with ur significant other shouldnt feel like a chore.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	As a parent I would say no, just come home earlier. If anything did happen I would feel like my permission got you into trouble. Youre expecting other people (your parents) to take responsibilty for your actions. They do not want to and I don't blame them. The bottom line is that until you are paying your own way, you are still a child no matter what your age is. It is just a fact of life. If you were mature enough to do all the things you want to do you would be living in your own place and not having to worry about your parents rules.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	i think you shud b able to, ur 18 n can make ur own decisions and are accountable for choices u make. however, u do have to abide by ur parents rules if u live under their roof.|`|6ea6d34e607603126e12379d095d0266aa	Well, being that you still live at home with your parents, I would say you should respect their rules - maybe he could come to your house more often so you don't have to drive so late.  When you get your own place, then you make your own decisions.  Hope this helps, good luck!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Your 18. Your an adult now, I think that you should be able to do pretty much whatever you want. Im guessing you still live with your parents and they like to control what you do. Maybe you should sit down and have a talk with them about how you feel. good luck.|`|QZ1siB8Qaa	As long as you are living with your parents, you need to abide by their rules.|`|61eLCih3aa	You live under there roof, you respect there rules|`|y9ZB0zHVaa	Youre 18, this should be YOUR decision . You shouldnt even be asking your mom .
qNVP4Q1Saa	There is nothing you can do. She has to hit bottom...|`|0F8hauikaa	You can't make anybody do anything they don't want, but you can let her know that you're extremely concerned about her health and her future if she continues down the same road. I have a friend who drinks too much and I always tell him that he is voluntarily making himself stupid from drinking. He didn't quit but he has cut down at least.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Well, I don't know how she is buying her own alcohol at 18, unless she is putting out at the liquor store, or living on a military base--otherwise, you have to be 21.  <br>  <br>  Anyway--there is nothing you can do.  She has to want to get sober.|`|8QWr77YZaa	You have to be a constructive friend.  If you are seriously worried, then you have to change yourlife style so inturn, your friends will change as well.  For instance, instead of going to a bar or a party, go somewhere fun, where alcohol is a minor role and not readily acessible.<br>  <br>  Your friend is not an alcoholic but merely experimenting.  It is better to learn young than get addicted older.  The worst thing you can do right now is try to confront your friend and self proclaim yourself a doctor and psychologist and tell them that they are an alcoholic and need to cut down on drinking.<br>  <br>  I say this because if it is indeed a serious problem, and you show them disdain or unapproval, that will lead them to drink more.  You might mention that "Man you sure do like to drink!"  Or keep hinting that you are tired of just getting drunk with them all the time and want to do other things.  I doubt your friend is an alcoholic, but if you keep telling them that you think they are, they will start to believe it which will actually lead them to becoming an alcoholic.  So be careful what you do.|`|AA12041870	There is nothing you can do.  An alcoholic has to want to quit before anything can be done.  My sister is an alcoholic.  I video taped her when her mouth was in full swing during a drunk episode.  She was so appalled at her own behavior that she did cut back considerable.  She still drinks about once a month, but that is better than everyday.|`|CqoTqEu6aa	unfortunately not much. you cannot force someone to get help only suggest they do it. what advice did the counselor give you? it can be brutal to watch a friend crash and burn. Try to offer her support and keep mentioning that she can find help and you can help her improve. try to get her doing activities with you where no one is drinking. . . that's all i can think of but i hope some of it was helpful.|`|qeLikL8Haa	well aa and a good talk should help also ask him if hes depressed|`|4dIWZCLGaa	Tell her she's drinking way too much. Say it nice. Tell her the dangers of alcohol. She could be raped if she passes out in places she doesn't know...or worse.<br>  <br>  It's good you're concerned for your friend. However, realize that an alcoholic is very stubborn. Sometimes you can provide all the support possible and they will still go back off-rail. <br>  <br>  Just give her all the support you can right now.|`|lErNxNWVaa	I think you need to spend some time on the AA website.  They have a whole section that offers support to friends and family of alcoholics.  I think you'll find a lot of information and support to help both you and your friend.<br>  <br>  Alchoholism is a sickness.  Being 18 means you're going to go out and have some fun, who hasn't? But going to the extreme of not knowing where you are due to alcoholic blackouts is not good at all.|`|fyKydb6Iaa	She has to admit to the problem, nice for you to be there for her, but keep in mind she is not your responsibility, don't mean to sound cold but you can't be spending your time worrying about her.|`|bzjLgfjcaa	get a court order that says she needs to go to rehab, cuz it's a harm to the public. she might be in a drunk driving accident!!! <br>  answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgG20EHxYwlGdx3WAJ4_zWHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304094420AAljhbI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yqWlt0Q7aa	Don't MAKE her get help, the more push her the more she will reject you, just be a good friend tell her parents about it. thats all you can really do now.|`|7bIrMvziaa	Call Intervention|`|tIg3low2aa	Help her and continue to provide support!|`|JaJHDjTLaa	try spending time with them. It will keep them occupied so they won't be able to drink, show them there are more things to do for fun than to go out and get smashed.  If they don't know or see anything different they won't change their ways.  Maybe even do some research on the consequences of drinking and show them how it is hurting them both now and later on in life.  There are endless possibilities to help them with their problem but most of all you must give them time, and show them that you care about them or else they will not care enough about themselves to change their ways.|`|zcGLGPGsaa	she's 18 and can buy alcohol?  where are you from?<br>  and you need to sit her down and talk to her.  because drinking too much is SERIOUS.  you need to tell her that her liver is valuable, and overdrinking messes up your liver and pancreas, both of which you can't live without.  and if you're an alcoholic you don't get put on the top of the transplant list, you go to the bottom.  i have a scary story about a man who drank himself to death.  she doesn't want that to happen to her, right?|`|zJ483z2kaa	You've seemed to have done a lot already. I assume you've tried talking to her about it already, too.<br>  You can warn all your local shops not to sell alcohol to her, but that's a big step, and i'm not completley sure if it'll work. <br>  Another step is to tyr and encourage her to get a check up on her livers and kidney at hospital to see how they are. Hopefully (well, not hopefully, but) something will be even a tiny bit wrong, to shock her and make her not drink so much.<br>  It's hard.|`|gaZ5CJw6aa	you can't help someone who doesn't want the help..<br>  maybe you should start showing her the things that she does when she drinks..<br>  video tape her and show her the next day..<br>  let her know that not alone is it effecting her..<br>  but everyone around her..<br>  <br>  she has to want help in order to get the help.|`|rUC7WHLVaa	The hardest thing as a friend to learn is you can not help someone who does not want it. It is so hard...all you can do is support her and give her words of encouragement!|`|djAfkJTYaa	well tell your friend how bad it can be and maybey stay withe her more and try to get her to drink other things!<br>  mabey show her what can happen if she continues!|`|hizUz9rDaa	tell her your concerned. you dont want to lose a friend because she chooses to be alcholic.|`|Ou3sFkKeaa	let her learn from her own mistakes but be there when she falls and needs help!|`|Mapm6AI8aa	i wuldn't hang out w her anymore, but if u really want 2... lay down the law and tell her how u feel.
46aa1c87e59cea852f9c28d9773506f9aa	I think that a very important lesson to surviving in any situation is knowing when its time to walk away. You dont have to be together to be a good parent, what will your children think of you if they found out about your arrangement? Maybe if you stay they will grow up in a situation where they get warped ideas of what marriage is all about. Only you can decide but I would just count my losses and move on before it gets worse because this sounds emotionally unhealthty.<br>  <br>  Get out, cry if you need to, be good to your children but think of your own well being first. The worse think you could do is stay in a situation where you know the love is missing. There are some people who from the start know they are in open relationships and that works for them but its different if just one person is calling the shots. <br>  <br>  Someone is bound to get seriously hurt. I would leave now. Your kids will get over it as long as you both try to continue to be the best parents you can be.Good luck!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Wow! Why not just sell her to the highest bidder. If you can live with the thought that some other man was deep inside your wife then more power to you. Any man I know could not deal with that. I would leave today. Don't even take time to explain it all to her. She won't care anyway.|`|AA10353286	Look. Most marriages end in divorce. The other half typically end in misery and death.((shivers))<br>  <br>  Don't let her drag you into an open marriage if you are wholly against it. Don't do it "for the kids" either. I see nothing wrong with an open marriage and/or non-monogamy, but no one should be pressured into something like this and be involved in something like that if they don't want to be.
0ucm3dmyaa	He still likes you, if you like him and want to be with him again... go for it!|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	Try him again|`|xgJbxZgfaa	be with him if u want!|`|nGdH31Ucaa	the whole "i kind of like you" makes me feel <br>  like he might just want to play you. you know<br>  what i mean?  or keep you hanging on..  to<br>  make him feel good.<br>  <br>  my ex will text me and tell me he misses me<br>  and it's so hard to be away from me, yet HE <br>  broke up with ME.<br>  <br>  i think it's his way of feeling good about himself<br>  because he knows that he broke my heart and i <br>  still love him.|`|TLim2pBTaa	Yeah he still likes you.|`|gaGQyJWLaa	umm he could just be teasing or your just his rebound|`|NtSQcyHLaa	No, he doesn't. If he liked you, he wouldn't have dumped you in the first place. Tell him he had his chance and that he needs to move on. Just don't rush into any relationships if you're still confused about how you feel about him, either. Just stay alone for a while and get your thoughts together before getting into another relationship.|`|JFJF3GPWaa	Your ex obviously still likes you. But think seriously about whether you want him back. Sometimes we just go back to our old boyfriends because it's familiar and you have loads of great memories with them not neccisarly because we like them. You have both probably changed a lot since you last went out. So think hard before you make a decision.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck =) x|`|q6eZ35TJaa	No.. i dont think he does.. why would he dump you in the first place..? and then get back again after what? if you like him back then go.. if you like someone else instead and u dont "like" him then i guess u shouldnt dumb yourself on him.. i guess he just wants attention.|`|vBcqzMz4aa	idk like maybe like jeeze like you should like ask like him like if like he like still like likes you like and like then like if like he like says like yes like then like you like should like say like no like lol|`|wZb7zilKaa	He has no other prospects!|`|FBXT3RsHaa	u should just go up  to him and kiss him tell him that you love it and maybe go to the bed with him have sleepover|`|AA11567955	He wants 2 skrew U up|`|PXN7r0RRaa	maybe he just cant get anybody but u|`|SaTa58emaa	Yes, probably. You seem young by the way you write. Your ex is also young i am assuming... Love is fickle. Maybe he liked you and allways has, but then met someone else he liked, or thought he liked.. and thats why he broke up with you in the first place. <br>  From experience... if he has burt you once, he will do it again. Don't waste your time, he seems like a wolf in sheeps clothing.|`|7NgtgmHcaa	Yes.  Yes he does.
6zwCDI8maa	Maybe she just wants some room - you could just be getting too paranoid, relax and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Otherwise there could be something on her mind e.g. (family, work) suggest you either give her some room (e.g. wait for her to text you instead of texting her). If she complains your not texting her enough - then perfect. Or alternatively you could ask her if everything is alright.<br>  <br>  Richy|`|DN1oonroaa	Time her Menstrual Cycle, learn it, adjust your moves to it, when to call, not call, talk rude, take her out, take her in, on top, doggy-style, etc. talk serious, when not to pressure her for time, company, sex, when to be a priest, around her !!! And the great thing is it falls in a 28 day cycle, and guaranteed within 3 months you'll know if she is for you or just a **** ashamed to pursue her true calling of becoming a prostitute.<br>  No Bull$#!t|`|bETXpixXaa	i dont know but i sure have|`|Ow7bKdfUaa	She may have heard something a "rumor" which may be causing her to act the way she does. She may also be loosing interest and she's acting the same way most people do when that happens. But considering that she wants to read your text messages for no apparent reason leads me to believe that she's guilty of something. Usually people who are cheating act very insecure because they're guilty of the same thing. Ask her to read her text messages next time. Honestly, I wouldn't waste your time and I would find somebody who is actually worth it.|`|syUGRutaaa	Sounds like to me that she's getting kind of distant. Maybe she is losing interest or maybe she's found someone else. Girls are kind of sensitive, so they change their minds like they change their underwear. I would quit texting her for a while and see if she tries to reconnect with you. If she doesn't then just try and stay friends and it will happen if it's meant to be. Don't stress it.|`|akRuaS7Gaa	Alright dude, I had this problem earlier in my now 8 month relationship.<br>  <br>  Rarely text her. She is probably one of the many girls who feel if the guy texts you too often, they are clingy. so just chill out. Everything will work itself out.<br>  <br>  And her going through your texts just shows that she cares!!!!|`|39X8e50Raa	it could be that she doesn't trust you   but  when i want to read my bfs messages im just being nosy tehe <br>  <br>  but  she could feel like your not giving her enough space so you could try leaving her for a bit and give her some space or  could talk to her about this is your feeling like there is something wrong|`|6ZadWNknaa	Talk to her about it. I know it's a strange concept, but communication does actually solve some problems. If there's no problem. No problem. But if there's a problem, then get it over and stop living in anxiety.|`|higqH8sKaa	the relationship is probably becoming predictable, something is up with her...She wants you to realize that's why your getting one word texts.

And don't let her read yours..|`|HQ4t7JfGaa	well get her flowers maybe?  or something that will make u trustworthy   and yep shes a smart 1 haha still good luck dude|`|AYH0RPsjaa	so am I -you are very boring/whiny.|`|vXlrA4oMaa	Yes, but she's gaining interest in me!|`|thSz8hPoaa	It sounds like maybe she might of found someone else and is feeling guilty so she is checking your text messages to try and put the blame on you.  don't  waste your time on someone whdoesn'tnt have time for you.|`|bJulb5Apaa	you should talk to her about it. ask her why she is acting like this. you have to work for your relationships, don't give up on her just yet.|`|IQiZUumLaa	She probably doesn't trust you.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	jumpin may have a point.. sad to say. If she is trying to find guilt in you that means she has guilt in her. Now... if that is not the case and hopefully so, stop smothering her. Constant texts and calls only makes you seem weak and needy even tho you really want to talk to her make her come to you. You will find that the conversations will be better too! Not a short to the point response. <br>  <br>  Don't play too hard to get but keep a little distance. Call her once a day or just text her something funny that doesn't need a response to but keeps her thinking of you throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KN3I89Ycaa	It sounds like she is pulling away and suspicious of you.  Ask her if everything is ok, it seems like she's distant.  If she gets really quiet or really mad, either she's sad to tell you or she's defensive...both are bad signs and you should walk away.  Maybe there's a reason and you can work through it.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Ask her why she always wants to read your texts. She's clearly suspicious. Could be because she's cheating on you and might think you're doing the same. Just tell her she seems like she's over it lately, and ask her if that's true.|`|yhcyvBOHaa	PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE|`|mdR98GYMaa	OMG, yeah, she is hiding something....

Try to reasure her that you only have eyes for her.<br>  <br>  and yes i think she is either going off you which does happen quite a lot with people after they have been dating 2 or 3 months or she has something on her mind that she's not telling you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck x|`|KPYQwyeraa	sounds like she is cheating and being paranoid that you are cheating on her too that's what usually happens the cheater is paranoid that their partner is cheating on them leave her you shouldn't have to put that much effort into a girl she should want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to her|`|nXZEoDO7aa	Its her choice mate !<br>  maybe you are wrong, maybe she is thinking about something else or worried about something else, remember if a girls isn't happy with you, she cant keep u happy !|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Stop texting her at all if she can't be asked to answer properly.|`|O5KOwhovaa	She's developed a 5% interest rate in me.|`|tIg3low2aa	Sounds like you need more than a texting relationship!|`|xgJbxZgfaa	maybe she's insecure... tell her to trust you!
LtMGBsI2aa	If i had to guess based on what you have written I would say the guy is into you.  You should have bought him a drink...lol.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like he's trying to feel you out and see if you are into him.  Buying him a drink was most likely a flirty way for him to try and see if you like him.  By his actions I would guess that he's dropping all these hints and you aren't giving him anything.  If you like the guy you need to let him know before he gives up.<br>  <br>  I would go up to him and tell him you want him to take you out...and buy YOU a drink.  Then bat your eyes and give him a seductive smile.  Let him know you're into him!  Good Luck!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Sounds very promising, just do not try to come between him and his dog, that could lead to the end of a new relationship very quickly.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	Sounds like he is a loser. Go find a better one.|`|Cs0sGt4caa	first of all why the hell would he ask you to buy him a drink?? it should be the other way around. thats probably how the entire relationship would be like..... and any guy who is obbsessed with thier dog to the point of carrying around a pic of it in their wallet and showing it off like its their ******* kid can forget about it!!!|`|nGdH31Ucaa	yes, he likes you.<br>  <br>  the whole dog thing.... kind of weird.<br>  <br>  ha, i say go for it though!<br>  <br>  because if you didn't.. you will proabaly<br>  end up wondering what could have been.|`|JwNZ7kK5aa	This one is easy. If you care about your job (and shouldn't everyone care in this economy?), then do NOT date him or anyone else there. If the relationship fails, it will be very awkward every time you see each other. It could cost you a promotion or possibly get you fired (he could be your boss in a year). <br>  <br>  If you don't care about your job, then you have nothing to lose and ask him out. <br>  <br>  I've never heard of the "you should buy me a drink" line coming from a man, but I can't imagine a guy asking that and NOT being interested in you.
AA12148009	Go to the movies with a big group of friends both guys and girls. Make sure you sit next to her. Then after the movie right before she leaves ask her out! Worked for me& my boyfriend.

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	You have 2 areas that are issues.<br>  <br>  Nervousness over the first time.<br>  <br>  Being tight.<br>  <br>  My wife, of 24+ years, will occasionally have medical problems when means no sex fo over a month.  Whenever we resume having sex she is always tighter and it takes massaging by me to get her to open up.  And she's had 3 kids.  So she has been stretched a lot more than you have.<br>  <br>  <br>  And whenever she has had medical problem, and she is nervous about us having sex again - she tightens up and its difficult to get in.  so I just go in a little way and do not try to put it all in.<br>  <br>  Get some KY jelly (at Wal-Mart).  Use it and have him to only go in the front until it starts hurting - tell him to stop. There are other ways you can get him off.  Then the next time, he can probably go in a little deeper.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Getting some astroglide will make it easier.|`|Bm4cPW8naa	There is nothing wrong with you... that wall he encountered is the hymen (the little thing that makes you a virgin lol) and he needs to break it to get in deeper. It's also a good thing to be tight down there.. makes it more pleasurable ( right now you can't see it). To make things easier and more comfortable try a lubrication... up until I used this stuf I experienced the same thing and girl let me tell ya LOL... anyways it's just a warming liquid... hope it helps!|`|74gPuaXMaa	Sex hurts the first time because you have a heymen, which is a layer of skin in the vagina that you have until you lose your virginity, or it gets ripped while doing sports or something. <br>  <br>  Anal, that hurts in general unless both people know what they are doing.|`|RRmwRLzsaa	it feels like that the first time b/c your not used to having something in you.<br>  it might hurt the second time a little.<br>  but you will get used to it and it will start to feel amazing.<br>  good luck.|`|0gdBjXb1aa	ya...have him go down on you, get you wet and it'll slide in<br>  <br>  no shitt anal didn't feel the best...you have to lube it up and ease it in  lol|`|dfwEtCZXaa	I'm guessing your a virgin and for me, it wasn't until the 4th time me and my boyfriend tried that we were able to have sex without it hurting.|`|QGpoy2t0aa	well duh its going to be sore your first time.!!! and if you didn't know that then you shouldn't be on here.|`|PpGCchNPaa	Get some KY lube and try it again relax...
pVnUhYLQaa	It sounds like he wants to break up with you, I don't know what wanting or not wanting to marry you has to do with that. <br>  I don't want to marry my girlfriend, but I love her and plan on being with her for as long as I do. <br>  Just because I don't want to get married, that doesn't mean I walk. <br>  Marriage has nothing to do with this; he doesn't see you in his future. <br>  I don't know what more time is going to do; more time for what?|`|JFJF3GPWaa	It depends on the person. Not everyone wants to get married which is absolutly fine, however if someone does want to marry and you don't they may think it's because you don't love them enough or not taking the relationship seriously, which deffinatly isn't always the case. Some people will be willing to not get married and just stay with the person they love, others will want to move on. Just remember no matter how much you want to you can't force someone into getting/not gettting married.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x

She must still have feeling for him is she is still doing this. If she cares for you then she would not be doing this to you. If she is texting and calling him then she could be doing other things. It's not fair to put you through that. I'm sure if you were talking to an ex I'm sure your girlfriend would not like it but she can do that to you? I would confront her  and dump her because I could not trust someone anymore if they had lied to me and were still calling and texting an ex.|`|QIYHApEkaa	DITCH THE *****!!!!!!!! She's got some SERIOUS issues and if she's going to lie to you about that then she'll lie to you about anything! She's probably doing more than texting him also I would say at leats a 99% probability that it's happening! RUN while you can!!|`|BjyXKFpRaa	she must still love him or they are just real good friends stop jumping to conculsion|`|8sWaWQWGaa	i think you need to find out the reason they broke up with each other was it because of him or her. also how long has it been since they been apart. if it hasn't been that long you should probably give her some space so she can decide what she is going to do . She probably miss him so you have to make her miss you and find out whats going on  in the meantime shes probably just using you to make him jealous or get him back you would never know unless you leave her and see what she does when you and her are not together.
AA12235978	Yeah, you need to go.  If roles were reversed and it was your Prom and he was in college, wouldn't you want to go and have him as your date?  Also, don't look at it as a "favor".  If you love him, you're doing it FOR him BECAUSE you love him.

You can't go back to the past...besides, he showed in the past he can't be reliable or responsible.  He wasn't then, and he isn't now.<br>  <br>  He's hoping to find that you are having issues and will want to pick up and be his crutch!  <br>  <br>  Make your contact short and sweet, and let him know, in a no nonsense way, that you are happy to be right where you are!  Write him back and talk about your WONDERFUL husband, WONDERFUL life WITH that WONDERFUL husband, how SPECIAL your husband is, etc!  If he wants to be friends and meet your wonderful husband, then have lunch together!  If you meet alone, he may get the wrong impression.  Be sure to let your husband know...so he can't ever let your husband think there is any sly meetings, etc.!  <br>  <br>  If all of his friends know you, then they know you are happily married, probably point that out, and he's thinking how happy you'd make him!  <br>  <br>  Let's put it this way, he's looking for fun on the rebound...and it can only do one thing...make you miserable!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QqY8YgGDaa	First you should read books about palmistry ,handwriting analysis to find the nature of  a person.You can also use private detectives to analyse a person|`|zoVxtBMCaa	Try speaking to him about it.<br>  He might still have feelings for you, you'll never know|`|3o7ULYoLaa	I agree 100% with Halo!

Let the judge know of the conditions that your child is in when they visit him. You have every right to deny visitation if you feel your daughter is in danger, which she obviously is. <br>  <br>  You can also ask for a visitation hearing to change the order, in family court, you don't need a lawyer. Keep records of what is going on when she does visit him, keep records of how you don't have his address, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie, I know it's not easy.|`|bO2rzfISaa	That stupid Mildred thing is really helpful.<br>  <br>  Have you considered getting CPS involved?

Good luck.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	You need to talk to the counselor and have a written report from her, even better would be her coming to court with you and give her professional opinion. I hope you saved the message that he left on your phone because they can hear for themselves that he isn't going to be there, and at the present time you have no way of getting in contact with him.  He can say he wants you jailed for contempt, but that is only to try and scare you into doing what he wants.  You also need to request child support, it isn't your problem that he doesn't have a job, that is his. If he does have some income than part of it goes toward the support of his child.  You have to hold your head up and do what you know is right for your child. Bring witnesses to court with you, the more the better.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Ok you can do this and Ill try to help you. Go to court without a lawyer if necessary. The Judge will appoint you one if he thinks its necessary but just tell the Judge everything thats been going on and why you took the action you did. This is all any attoney will do for you, just convey your words to the Judge for you and charge you for saying something you can do too. What contempt? I dont see any as hes endangering and neglecting the well being of his daughter here, not you. You only just have to explain it all to the Judge and let the Judge decide everything. You dont have to prove him guilty here. Judges are quite used to seeing people represent themselves in courtrooms nowadays and fuly understand you arent an attorney so they do help you along the way. Its not as bad as it seems and since this isnt a criminal court, theres no jury to impress. Its quite easy as a matter of fact as long as you can talk, youll be just fine. Good luck|`|xvey8ixPaa	Stay calm. report to the court date with all of your evidence. Try with all your might to get some sort of legal help to get a support and visitation order of some kind in place. Do not talk to him at all until after the hearing. Keep all messeges he leaves, if he says weird stuff you have it on tape legally, as he knows he is being recorded. Do not say anything bad about him to your daughter. If she askes about him just tell her that he is in a bad place in his heart right now and she needs to give him some time. The NCP will sometimes spout things that do not make sense especially if they are losing control of a situation. Do not react to it, you are doing fine doing the things that you are doing right now. Ask your counselor of they have any suggestions for legal help that might be more affordable, sometimes they have really good connections. Until you are in court, take the time to just relax, reflect, gather your thoughts and pray. Do not try to control too much. Play cards or games at home with your daughter and spend time making sure she knows you are there for her. I went through this for years the same thing over and over. I left the state we were in and came back to my home where my family is. I raised her on my own with little contact with her father. She is 20 now and understand that he is a flake and that I did my best. You will survive and you will be amazed at how fast if flies by. It is his loss to be flaky and not be a grown up in his relationship with his daughter. he has worse issues than this to settle for himself. maybe he needs to to that before he can be a good dad. Until then, protect her and do what is best for the situation. You will be ok. Just BREATHE. I feel for you! Much love and peace for you and your daughter!|`|E4tsKFMMaa	Its different state to state.  My x sounds very similar, no showers, stays up all night, doesn't feed him, no discipline, badmouths me & my family.  I would say that in the most severe cases its neglect, and I don't have much ground to stand on BESIDES THE RECORDS I KEEP.  Keep specific records of when what where for the courts. You can provide the courts with that information.  If he wasn't a danger to your daughter, you wouldn't with hold visits....in many cases you could be charged with contempt for it but in this case I would hope that a judge will see the truth.  Check out public assitance legal aid and child protective services.  They will help document his abuse.....Best wishes!|`|hIrdaRdWaa	I guess it depends on the state you are in as far as the laws go.. But from what i know.. He should have to tell you where he is seeings as he still wants visitation of his daughter.  Try this link below.. It is of course for the state of maine.

In the next three months you two could grow really close and then are you honestly going to be able to handle him moving?  It would kill me if my bf moved that far away and we have been dating for four months almost five now.  If you honestly care about him that much tell him exactly how you feel.  Tell him you only have so much time with him and you do not want to waste it.  Maybe you don't even have to date, just spend a ton of time together.  Then when he moves away you will always have that friendship.

zFx7NT2Baa	You have some good answers I will not repeat, except to emphasize our ears and necks are surprisingly arousing, if that is what you mean by 'turning a guy on' so that what is in his jockeys gets stiff.  If it is that kind of turn on, then placing a hand and pressing at his zipper will be both a shock and a turn on, even if you have no intention of doing more with him.  And -- I see (looked at pic) -- that you are not a small, girly type (rather solid, confident and attractive) so being confident around guys will be a turn on.

yb7DffnJaa	Gracie, you can answer this question better than anyone because you know him. If you like a particular activity, for example when celebrating, but he doesn't do not try to do the thing he doesn't like with the pretense of doing it "for him".<br>  <br>  If he likes to go out, take him out. If he prefers to stay in, and have you cook stay in and cook for him. Whatever you do be in a good mood and look your best. Let him SEE what he has been missing. Also be sure to be at least a little flexible in your thinking. He may for whatever reason be pooped. If this is the case don't act like a child and sulk, just relax and be you. You will have a great time!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|yLLN0gBraa	STD test?|`|W3oalpmVaa	get your hair done <br>  buy some new clothes :) <br>  and plan an exciting night :)<br>  x|`|AA11530144	A shave and some baby oil maybe?|`|fUd54bcsaa	Well first of all make an AMAZING meal, and have candlelit dinner.

Try to get a table tucked away from the crowd.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Looks like fun and I think this is a good first date and I think it's nice that you put some thought into it.She'll like it I'm sure,I love places like this.When it's to much then I get nervous but this seems a very down to earth place that should make you both comfortable.|`|ByVkqiSCaa	Yeah, I think it's a neat place as long as the music won't drown out your conversation.

kvN1w0j3aa	Stay out of it!!! Be a friend to her and treat the situation as if he said he was attracted to someone else, not you. All she needs is a loyal person she can trust right now. Her husband obviously has some issues right now and they need to deal with it on their own. <br>  If things are alright with them in the future, the best way to act around him as if nothing had ever happened.
7Wj0KW6Aaa	I don't think that they meant to make her feel that way. They were just trying to be good parents and they took it too far. I agree that they should ground her from a lot of things and tell her that she is not currently trusted because of her actions. But they still should have assured her that they love her and that her actions do not define her. Yes she needed to face the consequences, but if it was a one time thing with the drinking then I would say she need be grounded for no more than a month. That is a really tough situation and I hope you can all heal from it.|`|bO2rzfISaa	They did exactly what parents are supposed to do to encourage their child to turn things around. Her suicide was her choice.<br>  <br>  I know that feels wrong to you now, but I think when you view this from an adult perspective, you will see things differently. I don't expect you to like this answer.

And then based on his answer...stay, go, think again....
zxQT3Uo5aa	Stop having babies. You have to put your life's aspirations on hold to raise them.  You may not have realized the relationship between your choices and your aspirations, but there it is. Of course it is hard.  What did you expect?  It is hard with 2 parents and children.  You are trying to do it by yourself.  Why didn't you marry the Father and why are you allowing him to do what he can instead of all that he can?<br>  <br>  You seem to enjoy the place that he has ascribed for you but you situation is getting worse because of your attitude about it.  You are a single mom with occasional benefits.  You have to decide if that is enough for you?|`|ByVkqiSCaa	Just talk to him.  You may not be able to work out something that's ideal for either of you, but better than the situation now.|`|AA10470911	If this is a serious question...you need to assert yourself and stop being taken for granted.<br>  <br>  If he is hanging out in a club like that....you have  problems. BIG TIME.|`|AOyVGLB1aa	ok, so we have consulted this in a 3 person group.. and you need to get the heck out of there!!!<br>  he IS most likely cheating on you and you dint deserve that. he is a total jerk and you don't need the stress of worrying about him on top of everything else you have to do. <br>  if you have anywhere else to go then go there, and finish online school so you can get a job of your own and support your children.<br>  i feel really bad for you. good luck!!!|`|IuJcKGroaa	You need to have a serious conversation with him. Because from what you said he just wants you to be a house wife. There's nothing wrong with that a lot of women prefer it, but clearly you don't. So you need to tell him that he has to help you out with the kids and if he can't you need to get a nanny or babysitter. It's going to be hard for you to have a social life with 3 kids, but a lot of people can do it. Plus he should never play the guilt card with you because your the one who's given up everything to be with him and your not even married yet, so just imagine when you do get married and picture how your marriage is going to turn out. If he doesn't want to change for the woman he loves then you should leave him. I know it's harsh, but at least you will be happy and not feel bad nor worry what he's doing at night. Also get a gay guy as a friend they make great friends lol.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Obviously theres alot of stress at home. Its unfair that your dealing with all of it while your fiance is escaping it with every avenue possible. Dont feel guilty about bringing this up just to avoid an argument or further stress. Just because your guy pays for most things, doesnt mean you are incapable of it and your guy shouldnt have the say of being at stay at home mom forever either! Love and support is what you need now just as much as the money to pay for the children's expenses, your guy isnt seeing that very clearly so you need to talk to him seriously and calmly about how you've been feeling lately. Suggest having someone watch the kids for a night or two a week or hire a babysitter so you and him can get some more quality time together. You may be pregnant now and limited to certain things, but your fiance shouldnt be closing you off to the outside world. Get some friends together at your place on the other days he goes out, but also lay down the law and have him stay home with you some nights also. After you pop this baby out, let him know things are going to have to change. You can apply for college or take up a job if you like. You are not limited and can do what you wish. Start planning for this now.|`|b7PG9kHoaa	u would have to looking in ur self and see if thats the life u want|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	Honestly I can see how you are at your breaking point. I think you need to sit down with him and tell him exactly how you feel and what is bothering you and what you would like to change. It usually isn't a good sign when a man is so controlling that he doesn't allow you to ever leave the house or have any friends. You need to make sure and have your own personal time away from the kids and the house, otherwise you will go crazy. I think you should keep in touch with your friends and if he has a problem with it then maybe something is going on with him. I'm not really sure because obviously you can't just pick up and leave him since it seems like you don't have anywhere to go. If there is someone you could stay with or some place for you to go I would think about it if he doesn't become more understanding and actually listen or care about how you are feeling and what is going on. That is a major part of a relationship and what do you have if you don't have that understanding and cooperation.|`|Fwindd53aa	I agree with what Mal said, and just to elaborate, what your husband is doing is wrong. That is a form of abuse where they want to keep you holed in the house, and tells you what to do and what you can't do and keeping you away from friends and so forth, and the trouble you express sounds like you would have trouble getting away from him but you still want to love him and be able to care for your kids and don't want anything bad to happen, and as they say love is blind.<br>  <br>  The route I would try to take is for you to list out everything on paper, do make the attempt to discuss it with your husband, after you have made arrangements to stay with a friend, family member, or women's shelter. That way if your husband doesn't do right by you, be ready and prepared to make your exit with your children. These kinds of situation do get worse, and I've seen it on tv before, especially on Lifetime.|`|gGX9XpzLaa	unlike the first person who answered and didnt really read this, i did. and i dont really know how you feel, i will be honest. im actually rather young but i think i can help. your fiance needs to be paying attention to YOU and not those other girls. i would talk to him about it and be honest with him. because you said that he was your fiance which means you two are ingaged? then as a husband, he has to listen to you when talk to him. take charge! this is your family too! and your life! he cant control you like that, its not right. as people say, the husband are the pair of pants and the wife are the sissors (i apologize for the misspelling) at least its something like that. he shouldnt be with those other girls. you need to start demanding some attention but he should be giving it to you anyways! with a family, its hard to just let go and move on, its really not a choice for parents. just talk to him, be honest, and demand some respect and attention.<br>  <br>  oh and another thing, he cant control the things you do. if he really loves you (which im almost POSITIVE he does), then he would give you some freedoms. :)<br>  <br>  good luck and please take my advice into consideration|`|t3O0fLn3aa	first off andrew is an a**. it seems to me that he does love you but he is obssesive and paranoid. if you could talk him in to seeing a counselor maybe then it would be allright. but if not and he keeps being like that you may want to think about finding someone else. and there are plenty of men who would still love you with 3 kids. i pesonally love kids and so do many of my friends|`|uFJdh913aa	This sounds all around bad and unfortunate. You need to really sit down and talk to him about EVERYTHING. Sounds like he is obviously loosing interest for only reasons a man can answer and women can't understand. You may need to do what's in your best interest and get out.|`|wVZuBL0Zaa	Wow, sounds to me like your husband is avoiding you. He wants his freedom to do his own thing but doesn't want you to have the same. He may be having an affair or close to having one. He is avoiding spending time with you and the kids. This is unfair to you to do everything on your own. Have you approached him about these issues and let him know you can't continue to do this on your own?
kvN1w0j3aa	Just bring a friend with you when you meet her...she is probably just over-protective and he is probably joking about her "knocking you over".<br>  <br>  BUT be careful that she isn't in love with him herself!<br>  <br>  And you might want to tell him that your emails are private!|`|eO4y3m1maa	I recently met my boyfriends best female friend, it was hard at first but it gets easy....dont worry about it :)|`|AA12055335	Well if they are best mates then she most likely is just looking out for him and wants to get a sense of who you are. But, if they have dated before and are now friends, then it is more of a territorial issue. Where she wants to check out the "competition".|`|RTZvxTH5aa	Shes a good friend to him and is loyal to him, she just wants to make sure you arent going to hurt someone she really cares about.<br>  <br>    Be nice to her and try to be friends, its not a good idea to go against his best-friend, ESPECIALLY if its a female. <br>    <br>    As long as your genuine and honest, i am sure she will see what he sees in you and be nice.|`|dXRrxxrFaa	I think she is in love with him and wants you out of the picture.<br>  Sorry, but it is probably true.<br>  Watch your back when she is around.|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Just be yourself!! probably they are just trying to scare u for fun.  Dont try to impress them... say and do what u think is right!|`|IMPh53Ssaa	maybe she is a mormon and wants to convert you|`|vXlrA4oMaa	I think your male friend is really AN ALIEN. From the planet HERPES. He will use his nebulon ray gun (Which he disguises as a penis) to pass on his illnesses to you and yours. Watch yo step.

AA12324252	Phone the center, they'll tell you what you need too know.
V9qmbFQOaa	Gradually make friends with more and more people and so you can slowly break away from those who are not so nice. A sudden break will only cause problems. It's all part of growing up and maturing. Don't ever let them see that they upset you as that gives them power. If they make remarks about you being friends with other people, just explain that you like having lots of friends and it doesn't mean you can't also spend some time with them.<br>  Tell them you don't like being mean and hurting people so you try to be nice to everyone.<br>  Hope this helps|`|dIw1112Zaa	just tell them how you feel.  It might be hard at the time but it will free you!|`|9tTeBy6waa	just ignore them from now on, and when they ask you why, say I choose not to be apart of your backstabbing, I think it's childish- Of course they will probably talk smak about you behind your back- if you dont wanna go that route, just keep quite when your with them, and try and distance yourself as much as possible|`|ZZHnOqEsaa	Ok see what you do is settle the drama with a little bit of neglect.

dvOUQqv4aa	Yes I believe she still has feelings for you but she knows that when people date things could end up badly.  She is scared to lose you from her life all together.   It happens everyday best friends date and the relationship ends rough and they never talk again.  If you love her like you say you do then you will give her time to realize she wants to be with you and that you are the guy for her.  I mean at least she is still really close with you. Just keep showing her how much you care for her and eventually she will come around!!|`|47P7uLV6aa	It's hard to tell based on the very scant information given, but it sounds to me as if this girl has EXTREMELY low self esteem.  She craves attention, even from guys who treat her badly.  She believes she DESERVES to be treated badly.  But when someone wants to actually love her (like you) she pulls away because she doesn't feel worthy of love.  She is badly messed up.  <br>  <br>  I honestly don't know how you can help her, but if I'm right, maybe just understanding where she is coming from can help you deal with her.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KNBTViNNaa	You didn't make that real clear as to if she's still with the other guy or not. If she's still with the other guy that treats her like ****. It sounds like she is kind of stringing you along as back up.  If he dumps her it won't hurt so bad because you'll be there to break her fall. If she's no longer with him then I think that she is confused. Calling you at night to hear your voice sounds like she has some feelings still. She might just need you to be the man and step up and make the first move. Tell her how you feel, say you'd like to give it another shot, let her know that you are her friend first and you care for her deeply and would never want to see her hurt.  Let her know that her heart is safe with you.|`|NQI9JD5Gaa	she is lonely, but she doesn't want to be WITH you. i go through it every once in a while or i did before my hubby. i had a great friend but he had major feelings for me. i did not feel the same way but it felt so great on lonely nights to have a friend there to talk to me untill i could fall asleep. we no longer talk and that is sad, but like i said he wanted to be more. i still talked to him on the phone and stuff but after he tried to hook up it was left at just on the phone.<br>  <br>  long story broke down, he moved four hours up north and i haven't heard from him in about a year. i would still consider him a  friend, but thats just because i know that if i needed anything or he did we'd be there for eachother.|`|DsFFjBtOaa	yes|`|l7E3EreXaa	She sounds like she doesn't know what she wants but likes to keep her options open. Or as Chris Rock said, "Keepin' a d!#$ in case of an emergency!" She's stringing you along and the sooner you realize that the better.
8UjIkib8aa	well, first of all i think you should just move on, why spend your time, liking someone like that? if he was really your friend, he would support you. not make fun of you for something your emotions control, you can't help it right? so just leave him alone, and ignore him, he might get the 'message and smarten up, maybe he will want to be friends Again,<br>  you never know! but for now, just steer clear from him<br>  i know it hurts. <br>  but it's for the best...<br>  OR he might just be playing with you, he might even like you back, you know how boys can be./ they are all jerks, no offence! <br>  Well, hope this helped!|`|lcXtN4aLaa	you might just have scared him off, or he could just be the jerk that he acted like. <br>  why is it that you like him, and can you forgive him for what he did today?<br>  you clearly dont trust him if your scared hel'l tell everyone, and a relationship revolves around trust. You may be attracted to him, but if you dont trust him then give up now, it will never work.|`|RikCftYKaa	ok. i'm going to try and put this softly, but i might have to tell you something for you to get it.<br>  i recently broke up with someone and i really cared for him, and still do for that matter. i even wrote a song for him. but he didn't want to even listen to it once. he won't look at me when we pass each other in the hall way. he doesn't text of call me ever even though he promised me when we broke up that we would be friends. we even have the same 6th period and this still happens. i wish i could say forget him, but then i would be a hypocrite, because i know that i can't... and i would never tell you to not with the feelings that i still seem to have.<br>  <br>  i hope that i have helped you but if i haven't know that writing this has helped me at least a little bit... so i do not look at this as a waist of time at all|`|ce3afc706827acc3046f54718c325a10aa	You all need to grow up. I'm sorry but how childish can you get. <br>  <br>  I think you should tell him to stop being a childish jerk and get on with your life. He obviously doesn't want to be with you so find someone that does. You will always come across a idiot.|`|QOWPdl2qaa	He sounds like a real jerk. I'd say move on and if he says anything, just make a smart comment or turn it into a joke. Once he stops getting a reaction, it'll get boring for him.

You shouldnt even worry yourself over a guy like that. Not worth it. Just carry on without him. <br>  <br>  And what is a 'minger' btw?|`|o5jf15TTaa	That is so messed up.<br>  I dont know.. ppl deal with stuff in different ways.<br>  like if that was me, i would drive-by his house and make death threats..<br>  <br>  but for you.. you should probably just call him?|`|PyC1MIkXaa	Just move on. He's a jerk, and he surely doesn't deserve you. You'll find someone else, tons better.|`|7TWAEBleaa	don't talk to him he's an assbutt for doing that to you
KNBTViNNaa	No, he might be upset with his friends for some reason. Maybe they're getting into drugs/alcohol and he doesn't want to be a part of it so he's choosing to stay at home so that he doesn't have to look like a dork by being the only one not doing it.  Other reason's kids act that way are depression and poor self image and self esteem disorders.  Watch him closely, and don't accuse him of anything.|`|mmWuh8swaa	Well, in school he is popular, but outside of school its totally a different thing. School is where a student has to go in order to study and all, and it becomes a necessity already for socializing. Outside of school changes the environment. No blackboards, no bells ringing, no books, etc. This gives him a different feel to hang out with friends. Or maybe it could be a different reason. He is busy. or maybe he just has friends that just not that close. true, he maybe popular but it doesnt mean he has really close friends. Try asking him about friends in school and how you know he is popular?|`|l7E3EreXaa	I had friends and stuff at school but when I got home I liked being left alone. Have you considered the fact that he always has activities and is popular the reason he wants to be left alone at home...?|`|XoflZ5eLaa	maybe hes just addicted to porn?<br>  sry to say mom.<br>  <br>  but, if i were ud id snoop around, look for paraphernalia, drugs.<br>  hes 17.<br>  <br>  goodluck.|`|dBpWY76Maa	he's a home-body, leave him alone|`|8b3096c57688336d149d90f58b41399faa	seriously not for us or you to decide|`|63PBNGEeaa	Have you considered counselling?  It doesn't seem right.  Sounds like he could be maybe suffering from depression hun.  I would take him to the doctors and seek advice as it could be a slipperly slope.|`|CInHTKJcaa	first of all, that name doesn't let me believe that you are a mother....<br>  second(the actual answer):<br>  <br>  wow! i am just like that (other than that popular in school...and good in sports) it's a feeling i get which urges me to stay out of the whole thing and just be alone...forever...or at least a little bit...and i believe that's what your son feels...<br>  <br>  my suggestion: Leave him alone...|`|3MrhyHTZaa	i grew up a very reclusive person.  I have great friends, but i was content to stay locked in my room 24 hours a day with a good book.  If you are worried it may be depression because this is outside his normal behavior, then spend as much time as you can talking to him.  Make sure he is ok, and if you sense something off about him, get him help.  If you are worried about suicide then don't take the time to do that... get him to a psychiatrist immediately.  However, if he seems cool about everything, he probably just wants his alone time|`|m3KgI8qfaa	So.... what's the matter?<br>  You know it seems as it is a problem if teenagers stay out for a long time, it's a problem if they prefer to have relax at home... It's always a problem... :)<br>  Take it easy... your son is absolutely normal... he just prefers to stay at home doing what he likes... Maybe he's just the type who doesn't like going out doing stupid things... he's doing his experiences even in this "strange" way... :)<br>  <br>  Kisses...|`|J9jb56L2aa	its on him im 14 and im like that sometimes leve it be but take him and spend time with him he ither hates it and gos and hangs out with his frends or he gets out of the house with you|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well no thats not normal cuz guys or girls are age we like to have fun and go out with our friends
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it's not possible to fall out of love for no reason.  there is always a reason.<br>  <br>  if you fell out of love so easily then you were not in love, it was only infatuation, aka a "crush".  <br>  <br>  BUT it looks like you never met this guy in person.  You only communicated with him online and the phone.  You never knew him.  You only knew what he told you.  you were only "in love" with your fantasy version of him.  Fantasy is only good for a while.  eventually you need to have actual Real Life face time with people to have a relationship.  Think of what you had with him as a "celebrity crush"  You never meet the celebrity either, you only know them through their work and interviews and you have these goofy heady feelings for them that are fun to feel but not real because you don't know the person.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Have you ever met him?  My guess is this type of relationship over this period of time would be boring and pretty uneventful and defintely not stimulating.|`|LkUBeNTsaa	Looks like you have found some one else who interests you more than him?  May be you were just infatuated and the charisma of his fake persona worked out on you over internet.<br>  <br>  Still... Give it little bit time before moving out.
iPNOVR6Gaa	Yeah, I can't decide if it's ridiculously childish or flaming gay.  You'd better have a talk with him and find out which it is!|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	Yes I would definetly confront him - this is not normal behavior.|`|AA11185479	First, apologize to your husband for snooping through his phone without his permission, and promise you will respect his privacy from now on.<br>  (that gives you a great segueway to) Request that he, in turn, respect the privacy of others.  Remind him that taking these pictures is not only illegal, but rude and childish.  He could lose his job or get sued if anyone ever finds out about this, and the risk isn't worth the chuckle.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I sure would and I would want a very good explanation.   I do think that could get him is big trouble. sexual harassment on the work place. which is a means for termination.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	I would think it's kind of weird to do this but who knows. Doesn't sound mature. If someone comes out and complains he may be fired. That is what I would be worried about|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you need to talk to him and tell him to grow up.. ... if you can stay with him ...|`|IvMPh09baa	haha... oh man... sound like he might have a case of the GAY|`|fGLHYL0yaa	It's not easy but you should confront him. This is obviously bothering you, and it will keep on bothering you until you're clear of it completely. Be calm, sit doen with him, and be like (hey, there's something that's been really bothering me lately, i need to get it out, and i need you to clear me out. The other day i went through your phone to see if you had any pics of me and you on your phone, and instead of finding us, i found some really disturbing pictures)|`|ze7xiJwTaa	You have to ask him about it. Could be a silly prank (men are so immature sometimes) or he could be doing something creepy. Either way you need to confront him and see how he reacts. <br>  Try to do it 'by accident' so he doesn't get pissed at you for snooping. Grab it and take a photo or two of him then go back to review them (finding the bathroom ones at the same time). That way if it's just a prank it won't look like you were snooping and freaking out for nothing.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Seems you never really knew your husband after all and his real personality is just surfacing.   This is not only an inmature act but a homosexual act, keeping pictures of other men in a bathroom is not something that should be kept as a souvenier by a real man.   If I were you, I would just observe him closer, get to know him better and then decide is you are going to stay with who he really is.|`|krQiDGCHaa	They're probably not childish games at work, they are probably him being gay, bisexual, or bi curious and wanting to experiment.<br>  <br>  He probably gets a sexual thrill out of taking these pictures of men.  Why not ask him about it?|`|AbCfSzX9aa	I think this is something that you def need to confront him about. You said this has been going on since Nov 08, why does he has pics from Jan also if it was all just a game. I think you guys should sit down and talk. Good luck!|`|Vhfb7UACaa	That's nothing - I have 2 friends that regularly photograph their crap.  It's a GUY THING - don't try to understand it - just go along with it - just breathe deeply.|`|pV6K2mm5aa	You write like you already know the answer.....he fancy's the same gender.  Call him on it.|`|xCK70761aa	Your husband is just being a little boy around his buddies who are also little boys. At that age, he still going to act immature especially around his peers. If there was physical interaction, then thats another story but if its just taking an embarrassing picture of his coworker.. thats nothing to speculate about. Don't worry|`|jeYi7APraa	yes you should seriously have a talk with him..<br>  and thats not childish thats more like gay..i'm sorry but i dont know any guy of any age that would take pics of dudes in bathrooms...thats just strange.<br>  <br>  You really really need to talk to him and see whats going on.|`|9FGXOIFWaa	Def confront him, you have a right to know what is going on! You'd hate to think it, but if he could have bi-curious urges or anything. Your health could be in jepordy|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Looks like u married a sh!twatcher. It's kind of gross but not the end of the world. Note to self: don't go looking if you cannot handle what you may see.|`|tmqEaoFyaa	well i would say no its march.<br>  <br>  if he hasnt done it in like two months then hes probably over it<br>  <br>  but keep an eye on him for lets say until late may or early june if u see anything else confront him|`|GU4S78ejaa	He does sound pretty childish but it is also disturbing, at the same time! I think you should definitely confront him about it! What if he has other issues or curiosities going on... good luck!|`|QQIIWpfSaa	Either he is extremely immature or extremely curious???|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Sounds like your husband is a fudge packer.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	confront, you probably want to run that is just not right on so many levels|`|Sp5TjXqMaa	Confront him.<br>  <br>  Just let him know you were in his phone and you came across some pictures that have been bothering you. Don't accuse him of anything, because you never know, they could have all been goofing off. <br>  <br>  Some jobs, especially the "real men" ones tend to be incredibly childish at times. My husband is an electrician so I've seen some stuff. No pictures of coworkers going to the bathroom, but you never know, they may all be doing it as a chance to humiliate one another.<br>  <br>  The key is you need to talk to him about it before jumping to conclusions.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  I am not saying I approve of his actions, but I think the conclusion of "OMG! HE'S GAY" that everyone else is jumping to is a bit extreme, at this point. <br>  <br>  As the person above me pointed out, you should let him know that there is a chance he could get fired as I do believe this sort of thing can be counted as sexual harassment. <br>  <br>  EVERY job I have had has had strict policies about privacy in the bathroom, so you should point that out to him.
m001xWWKaa	Do you know what she likes to do outside of school? Do you know anywhere she would be that would also be of interest to you where you could run into her?  I wouldn't stalk her or anything, but if there is a chance for you to meet up with her outside of school where you might be able to have a conversation with her it would be a start. You could go up to her and tell her you go to school together and introduce yourself, hopefully you will then be able to talk about whatever it is that you are doing outside of school. Maybe you are at a sporting event, you can talk about the sport.  The first step is starting a conversation with her, does she have a teacher that you have also had that you might like, or not like?  Are you friends with any of her friends? Try to find something you have in common with her that you would be able to use as a conversation starter. While gossip is not a good thing, and I don't recommend spreading it, it can be a good conversation starter. <br>  <br>  If things go well in the conversation, ask her to go to a movie sometime, or to dinner. By asking her out it will confirm to her that you are interested.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zetxxZWUaa	If you fancy her you should tell her, there is no way to let her know you fancy her unless you tell her. Plus, if you just tell her that shows you have guts and are man enough to admit it and she will respect you for that and totally be flattered.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	Other than telepathy, telling her may be your best bet. If you have any friends in common, ask them to express your feelings for you.<br>  I think lesbianism is the neatest of all perversions.|`|tDKQ8lwsaa	keep an eye on her, when she's alone go up to her and talk to her and do that for some time until you're friends, then ask her out =)|`|PhKzejntaa	Go say hi and introduce yourself.|`|K9hVqE7Haa	first off pleace say KNOW instead of NO it gets me pissed off... and second be dirrect|`|ZZHnOqEsaa	First off dont use fancy haha. Second off, dude honestly if you like a girl that much, just introduce yourself andbe friendly towards her. Be yourself and chances are she might like you back. Don't just come out and say ooh ive beenw atchin u and i think you're pretty and i wanna hook up. Girls might find that creepy haha. So yeah just introduce yourself and set something up where u two "magically" meet lol. Even if it means myspace or AIM.|`|9tTeBy6waa	You walk up to her, politely introduce yourself, then say Look I have noticed you, and I was wondering if you would ever be intrested in going out to the movies or whatever with me.|`|U8hLan5xaa	First, calm down. Second, just talk to her. Don't get too hyped up in "letting her know you like her", just be a friend and the rest will come.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	That will be impossible especially if you havent spoken to her, that should be the first step.|`|J9jb56L2aa	do like nepolian dinomight did but INSTED OF A PICTURE eat all her frends and family and then EAT HER CAT|`|tmqEaoFyaa	just do it!<br>  <br>  if u can get near her and she doesn't run off thats ur first clue<br>  <br>  then just introduce yourself and ask her to spend sometime after school and go from there|`|4PxfSPgPaa	jus tell her wen ur on ur own n jus say i need to talk to ya n tell her then good luck xxx|`|nNBl1EMgaa	Be friend with her friends so that u2 could meet up one day/|`|WNnTlodGaa	try to hang around where she hangs around, try make eye contact, smile..... try to get to know her friends (an old trick lol) sooner or later you'll know her and maybe you can build the confidence to tell her how you feel??

65ojSBXgaa	What matters is how you feel you know you are beautiful and more and thats all you need. The reason guys may not notice you is because being beautiful as your self they might think you are taken and they are not worthy. So what you need to do to get noticed is wear bright colored clothing and walk with confidence and a smile dont cross your arms because guys see this as "not interested". Take it from me kid-do I know I'm the same. But cheer up stay beautiful remember its not pretty being beautiful so Work It!!! Good Luck<br>  <br>  Gail Friend|`|onrcmQf8aa	95% of men are no good, and they are only looking for sexual activities.  Then,  there is a 5% of men that are good. 4% of them being gay, married, or related to you.  That leaves 1% of men that are good...<br>  <br>  So,  you can see that your percentage of finding a decent man is low.  If you are smart, and independent then a guy isn't going to want a girl that will not put up with his b.s. Also,  they may be intimidated by your beauty and/or scared to ask you out.<br>  <br>  You will find that secure, decent man.  Just don't rush it.|`|QOWPdl2qaa	Don't put yourself down, first of all. No one is perfect though. But I've heard beautiful girls usually don't have boyfriends because guys are too intimidated to come up to them. Don't worry, my experiences are the same.|`|Xka2R4EJaa	maybe guys are just intimidated by you! guys are afraid of a beautiful smart independent woman! just give it time when you're not looking and when you are comfortable with yourself someone will come along!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Your friends are saying things to make you feel better|`|MlnvuJAgaa	I think that your friends may be lying to make you feel good. :/|`|UwnXYMI4aa	GET A LIFE|`|S1CLLs4Laa	mayb ur friends r lying|`|MkZ3hzTEaa	I'm going through the same thing. And you know what I've come up with? There are some women in the world that need to be saved and rescued, but then there are others that don't need a knight in shining armor.

Go find your prince charming and prove to yourself you deserve him!|`|Qg4m0jnwaa	1 friends lie to make u feel good, #2 DON'T CALL PPL FREAKS, that's how u don't get dates most's Freaks are cool (look at me ^_^), #3 no ones perfect and don't  "show some skin" that makes ppl look like a slut (no offence), #4 Ask a guy out its ok to do, iv been asked out 3 times by girls (wonder why im still single LOL), anyway go with what u thinks right and not other ppl.|`|nG9ttQq9aa	Awww...<br>  dont worry what guys think about you. you will find someone that like your friends think that your perfect. dont put your self down. the right person is right round the corner. you will meet him soon enough <br>  Good Luck,<br>  xxxxxxxxx|`|Ob6m9z4oaa	It probs nt u! u dont want 2 get wiv just any1!

yFSv9sfgaa	I think there is a certain truth to opposites attract because really, most people don't want to marry the male/female version of themselves. I think balance is key. If one person is loud and friendly, the other person may be friendly too but just not to the same extent. Because that would just be annoying.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	opposite personalities attract sure, but similar type childhoods growing up such as middle class, etc.  make a longer lasting relationship.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	Opposite attraction is exciting and fun but does last in my opinion. Persons with similar interest tend to do better.|`|PhKzejntaa	Ok, if everyone was the same, it would be boring. Yes, opposites do attract but so does similar personalities. It all depends on how well the two work together. In most cases, men don't understand women and women don't understand men.<br>  Love for sex and sex for love.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I believe in the beginning those who are opposite can seem very attracted because the difference is a nice change.  But in the long run the stronger relationships are ones where there are similar backgrounds.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	I've been attracted to both opposites and similars at about the same rate|`|AA10121156	they attract first and then they dis-attract|`|2uFcGttqaa	I do think opposites attract to a degree. Being with someone who was too similiar would be boring and it would drive me crazy; it would be as if I were looking at a male version of myself. <br>  <br>  I like balance in a relationship.  For example: My bf is someone who is willing to try virtually anything, whereas I tend to look before I leap. Yet I admire his willingness to try new things, because he doesn't worry incessantly about risks, etc. I think  his different attitudes may help me break out of my shell more. In a sense, your partner could complete you in an area that you have trouble with. <br>  <br>  However, I do think it's essential to have more in common with your partner than not.  My bf and I share many of the same values, hobbies, relgious views, etc. If you have little or nothing in common with your partner, then why bother being in a relationship?|`|cM9DBbgnaa	yes!!! opposites do attract!! people with same personalities will never be able to get along... for example a dominant male with a dominant female will always fight wanting to be the more dominant and a recessive female with a dominant male will get a long because the female wont be fighting with the male all the times! XD|`|cn49BbRiaa	Yes I think that opposites attract they are many odd couples <br>  you see each day the looks completely different from each other.|`|0k8H91Dpaa	I think in some occasions that may apply .<br>  Then again we also like people who we can relate too ; and share common interests . In my case i think opposites do attract .|`|AA12117694	they dont attract lol..if that was the case this girl who I like does the opposite stuff of what I do would like me, and she dont that much, so no they dont.|`|ayM5TlcXaa	i think opposites attract more but you hav to share at least a little in common|`|2k8NmkENaa	opposite i say|`|6jgjZEB2aa	Opposites Attract is the true universal role.<br>  <br>  You would learn about similarities in personality and backgroud of the other person once you are already attracted and are thinking to build a relationship.
FZ90v0SBaa	I'm not familiar with your area but this site might be useful to you...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eventective.com/USA/Wisconsin/Wedding-Receptions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eventective.com/USA/Wisconsin...</a>
2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	First of all, don't ever make any mention of gifts whatsoever.  Gift-giving for a wedding is always optional, and it will be up to the congregants whether to give you one or not.<br>  <br>  Rather than even mention the other reception at all, I would just word the open invitation like this:<br>  <br>  "(Bride) and (Groom), along with their families, cordially invite you to bear witness to their marriage on (date) at (time)Light refreshments in basement from (start time) to (end time, about an hour later maybe)."<br>  <br>  This way, it's an obvious invitation to the wedding ceremony itself, but not anything after that.  Plus, if you have a specific end time in place, they won't expect to linger with the newlyweds.  Just make sure you have a cocktail hour in place at your reception venue so the guests who are actually invited to that reception have something to do while you're receiving your church congregant guests in the basement.  Also, I think you'd be wise to take the majority of your wedding pics before the ceremony, so your guests won't have to be stuck waiting for you to finish up in the basement AND to get your pictures taken.|`|sLLgERQWaa	I think it's a lovely solution to your problem, Hon, after all a reception  can be small and private & just for family as long as you hold some sort of reception for all who attended the wedding after wards....good luck.
JJUZFvggaa	I personally did them before and totally enjoyed it. Plus you can take pictures after too but it wont take as long. You will be able to enjoy your guest longer. <br>  <br>  We actually did what is called first glance shot first (well we did the traditional getting ready separate, mom and me, etc... first) then he did his traditional shots. Then he stood at the bottom of the stair way on the other side so he couldn't see me, and I walked slowly down the stairs (like it would of happened but with only our family and bridal party watching). My girls followed behind me and his guys stood long side him and parents gather close to watch the reaction. Then we took all the normal shots and few I wanted. Then I went back up stairs (touched up the make up) and waited for our guests. <br>  <br>  We did about 30min of shots after but so thankful I had done the main shots before. We also had a sun set wedding so we knew we were going to lose light towards the end. I got to enjoy my reception I worked very hard to put together and got to speak to each guest before dinner. <br>  <br>  I have seen first glances in a ball room, where the groom is facing a wall or window looking out and the bride approaches from behind and taps his shoulder he turns to see her. So wonderful, plus you feel less pressure walking down the isle and trying to take it all in. I had my photo guy 8 hours and ceremony and reception was only four and half. So I used all that time for special shots and picutres I wanted.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I've never been to a wedding that did that.  that's why you have a cocktail hour for the guests, so they can get liquored up while you bop around with the wedding party having pics taken.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	After. It wasn't because I didn't want him to see me - but I wanted us to be MARRIED in the pictures.|`|sGP6s7uraa	This is how the past 4 weddings I've been to have done them: bride with her girls, groom with his guys and then pictures of the bride and groom seeing each other for the first time.  It's very, very intimate (just the two of you and the photography capturing that very special moment).  The pictures have come out beautifully and it keeps the tears at bay by the time the bride walks down the aisle (for her AND him).  Afterwards, the group pictures are done.  Then ceremony pictures, reception pictures and then maybe a few more poses and intimate pictures one on one with the photography while everyone is dancing.|`|cGbTJobeaa	We did a combination of both.  Before the ceremony, I had photos taken in the church with my bridesmaids, flower girls and mom/siblings.  Then I went into the brides' room at the church and my husband had a series of photos taken with his parents and daughters and the groomsmen.  After the ceremony, then we did the full wedding party photos, more family photos, etc.<br>  <br>  Other than the women in the wedding party and my immediate family, I did not want anyone to see me before the wedding...and that included the groom. LOL.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Well everyone will definitely look better before the ceremony. Especially if any of you are criers- the makeup would be all messed up after! I really want to do mine before. I think that tradition is dumb, and i know i will be less nervous in front of people if i already saw my groom and we've talked. If you are firm in that tradition though i suppose you should just do them after and make everyone at the party wait for an hour :-/|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	We did our pictures after the ceremony. <br>  Even though we were really late to our reception. <br>  I still liked doing the pictures after the ceremony.|`|WZG4Dwzhaa	We did pictures both before & after the ceremony.<br>  Before there were pics with the groom & his groomsman, parents, grandparents, and even ones with him and the bridesmaids. Then there were pictures with me and my bridesmaids, etc.<br>  That way afterwards we only had to take the leftover pictures togethether with family and then ones with just us. <br>  It works out great that way & you don't ruin the surprise :)|`|h836dd9qaa	We're taking pictures with the bridal party ( me with my parents and  bridesmaids, him with his parents and groomsmen) before the ceremony. Than after the ceremony we're taking our picture together.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I've heard of that too...but I dont see the point you are going to take them anyway..besides I want to take pictures once i am actually married...and we have our wedding rings on our fingers...<br>  <br>  its up you..do what you think is best for your wedding...not what other tell you...|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Well.  I am a wedding photographer.  And all of my clients do portraits after the ceremony.  Tradition.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	After.|`|RKvVwoSWaa	After..|`|jBjc1UACaa	both before and after...we just split them up so it would not be too much at one time|`|491EQELVaa	Traditionally the photos are taken throughout the entire ceremony and reception. But the majority of the actual "photo photos" are done between the ceremony and the reception. I think you will get that sense you want doing it at that time. The photos will show you for the first time truly as husband and wife and you will see that in your faces. You will always look at those photos and say to yourself "Our first picture as husband and wife". If you were to do them before the ceremony you would likely have that "anticipation" look on your face. Plus, you will always look at the photos and KNOW that you weren't yet husband and wife. I would just make sure that it didn't take TOO long. You don't want to keep your guests waiting a really long time. If there's one thing that bothers me about attending weddings is the terribly long wait time between the ceremony and the arrival of the couple to the reception.

It could be displayed in a shadow box with the family name, a swatch of the tartan, and a brief family history, with some tea lights around it.  That could also double as table names for place cards- "I'm sitting at the MacDougal table, what about you?  Oh, I'm at the MacLeod table."|`|92b40317bf63e9bbba26965c09b155a0aa	I'm not sure what grows in Scotland, but mountains makes me think of trees..... Have you thought of using birch twigs?

I don't have a Scottish surname, but there is a 'this is the Scottish version of your surname tartan'. <br>  <br>  Then, use this as a colour scheme for a selection of heathers/flowers in a ring, with a candle in the center?<br>  <br>  I like the answers above too - esp. the table name idea!<br>  <br>  What a lovely theme - I hope you have a wonderful day.
AA11693263	She will be able to appreciate your concern for her one day but for now she is in hormonal hell and just wants a coke!! :) Cravings are so crazy during pregnancy. They get a hold of you and you just have to have whatever it is that you are craving. It's horrible! Did her doctor tell her that she can't have Coke at all or to just drink more water? If she is allowed to drink them try making a deal with her. You will get her another one but she has to drink so many glasses of water before she can have more. Maybe you can get her to drink the kind with no caffeine in it. She can probably have more than one a day as long as she is drinking plenty of water. Is it that she just doesn't like water? I don't like water at all. It makes me nauseous to drink it plain. Maybe you can get her to drink juice instead. As long as it's healthy, no added sugar and no caffeine it will be okay for her to drink that in place of water. Or maybe you can get her to replace the coke with juice mixed with some carbonated water. You are being a good husband and father by trying to take care of her and your baby. You are not wrong for your concern. But maybe try to find an alternative that the both of you can be happy with. Good luck and congratulations to you both.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	No you are not wrong. You are looking out for her and the baby and she is being very selfish by asking you to do some thing the Dr. told her not to do. Great job Dad and congrads on the baby.|`|GvamTVqAaa	I understand intentions, but it may not be smart to get in between a pregnant woman and well - anything.<br>  <br>  Just say "honey the doctor told you to lay off the soda's so I'm not going support you going against the dr. so if you want a soda you'll have to go get it yourself, but I wish you'd have some water with me"  Just beware of the shoe that may be flying toward your head :)|`|x3EPqezJaa	Get her a caffeine free diet coke. That's basically water anyway, and fluid is fluid, if she's dehydrated. It's a nice compromise. While caffeine is dehydrating, it doesn't have enough dehydrating properties to negate all of the fluid in the Coke itself. So it's still a net gain of fluid. And I think you should have gotten her the coke anyway if she insisted. She's not a child herself, you're not her policeman.|`|34b40Vu3aa	No not at all.  Just remember, her hormones are little wonky right now, try not to take things personally.  Stick to your guns, it is what is best for her and the baby.  Very good of you to stick by the same rules as well.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I think that if she is that thirsty - she can get her own drink and you can tell her that!  Then you don't have to monitor her...she's hormonal - at the end we get touchy about EVERYTHING!  Let this one roll off your back...|`|8o1ZdCkuaa	You are doing the right thing.  Plus, don't forget coke has caffeine in it and pregnant women should not have a lot of caffeine.  Also, caffeine can dehydrate a person.  She should drink more water because if she gets dehydrated it can be very serious.  Now also remember that pregnant women shouldn't have those sugar substitutes like NutraSweet or splenda so if she is going to drink a soda make sure it is NOT diet and if you can, get her regular Coke that is caffeine free.  Also know pregnant women shouldn't have too much sugar either so between the sugar and caffeine all she should have is one a day at the most.  Good luck to you and your wife!|`|Wj212FWXaa	pregnant people arent supposed to be drinking caffeine, so limiting it to one coke a day is pretty smart.  its not wrong for you to tell her no, youre just looking out for her and the baby.<br>  <br>  try going to shaws or stop and shop and getting the bottles of fruit flavored bubbly water... its really really good (not gross like seltzer water), and its essectially just carbonated fruit-2-0.  she might like that; she can substitute that for soda.|`|2sF0qPjBaa	She should not be having caffeine when she is pregnant. I don't think you should deny her what she wants, but maybe you should point out that coke has a lot of caffeine and that the doctor did say to drink more water... she does want to deliver a healthy baby, right?|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	i'm a complete coca-cola addict.<br>  but when i was pregnant i tried to cut down on the coke.<br>  but cravings were worse.<br>  especially since i was already addicted to the stuff.<br>  let her have a coke.<br>  just give her lots of water to drink too.<br>  she should be fine.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	She is pregnant .. she deserves a soda when she wants it, just back it up with a glass of water, or buy those mini cans of coke and bring her that AND a glass of ice water.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	No. You are looking out for the well-being of both her and the child. Coke has caffeine and caffeine dehydrates. Try giving her sprite if she needs a soda fix.|`|gnom5J8Naa	No It's your baby too!|`|WmwEYzYkaa	not if the baby's health is in danger.|`|qJKqDPqMaa	if i were your wife i would slap you because i think if she cant have one then you cant have one but that's just my opinion.. <br>  and shes pg yea stop with the cokes water is better anyway

WMR8hVlfaa	Some girls shave everything, some just trim their hair, others leave it wild. If he wants to perform oral sex on you, I suggest at least shaving/trimming to get most of it out of the way so he isn't getting hair in his mouth during. I personally shave everything, but it's mostly for cleanliness, especially during my period. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't let him make you feel bad about yourself down there.

To think rightly means to perceive reality properly, and to think on the basis of truth<br>  <br>  What is the root cause of such a high divorce rate in the society? What is the root cause of the hatred, bitterness, and strife that exists between the male and the female? <br>  <br>  The root cause is the sin of infidelity, unfaithfulness to our word, dishonest, false, and deceitful communication. This produces in our mate disappointment and dissatisfaction, which produces quarrelling and arguments that drive away the spirit of love. Love is the mortar that holds the union together. Where there is argument and dissatisfaction love disappears; then, there is nothing to hold the union together. So, we break apart.<br>  <br>  When we break our word and our commitment to each other, this is infidelity.<br>  <br>  Infidelity produces a lack of confidence because of false and deceitful action between the mates. Infidelity begins a process of estrangement. Infidelity begins to weaken the will to feed life to the relationship. Infidelity ultimately kills the desire between the two people who have agreed to live as one.Love in the truest sense of the word is not an emotional feeling toward our<br>  mate. Love is the force or power generated from acting on the principles of truth.<br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness<br>  LOVE is the creative force out of which life comes. To truly love is to live and to have true life is to exist in true love. Lust is different. Lust is a passionate or overmastering desire. It is sad to say, that most of our marriages are conceived in lust. <br>  <br>  Therefore, when this overmastering desire is fulfilled, the marriage ends. The true life of marriage is based in the quality of love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You should keep it to yourself that what he thinks he's measuring in inches is actually being measured in centimeters.

When I was in 3rd grade my best friend gave another girl a best friend bracelet, and my heart was SO torn over it that I didn't think she needed me any more and I became really angry. <br>  <br>  I'm 22 years old and this girl and I are still close. After going through your situation. Sadly, she does this to her other friends now! AND SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN. When one of her best friends gets really close to someone else, she will send angry texts saying things such as, "I guess you have another best friend now and you don't need me anymore." And will temporarily end the friendship until she gets over it. <br>  <br>  This is so natural in women, because we become very protective and possessive of things that we hold closest to our hearts. When your friend sees you sharing the smile and laughs that you normally share with her with other people, she feels like she isn't special anymore. Anger usually comes from jealousy... hence the cold shoulder. It's a friend thing. It will pass, and if it doesn't, it shows you the bigger picture on how good that friend was in the first place, if she really lets this get in the way.<br>  <br>  <br>  The other thing that comes to mind is that you did something, or she thinks you did something, completely unrelated to this subject and she's angry.
yFSv9sfgaa	Awww...(sorry)<br>  I had to tell a guy I really liked that we couldn't be together because we had VERY different beliefs. If she is willing to deal with your belief system then fine, but if she isn't, she shouldn't string you along because you make her feel good. And I know it doesn't help you that you are confused because she says one thing and the next is begging you to come back or stay. You need to ask her point blank.|`|mgqDwyRiaa	Tch. A religion that smothers your dreams is garbage! The power of love can bend the universe to its will!|`|WFZB4QnSaa	Are you guys a really strict religion? Is a relation allowed??|`|BXgqdaMVaa	No No you doing it all wrong..Justs walk up to her and say..BITCCH!!..IS YOU GONE GIVE ME THE Pusssy or what??..it works for me lol|`|FewhKlx9aa	I would'nt tell her just yet,I would want to take things slowly and go on dates with her.Maybe her feelings will change and her religion to want to be with you..If maybe in a year you are just friends tell her rthen when you know there is'nt a chance of becoming a Bf/Gf. She may feel strange knowing this book is about her for everyone to read and that can backfire on you.So see how the relationship plays out and have fun for now.|`|HGp6d3cEaa	Personally I would wait till the first publication or final draft and dedicate the book to her with some thing like "To my muse, (insert her name here) without I wouldn't have a page of this." something like that

Good luck|`|1rn6uxIWaa	You could write your own vows and in them say something like, I never thought I'd meet someone as wonderful as you from a simple website... yadda yadda yadda.

Or have your FH add it into his speech?  <br>  <br>  xx|`|0jUGSaZPaa	You can write a "short story" and put it in your programs, on each person's plate, etc.|`|AA11312653	This sounds like a wonderful story, a delightful story, but please save it for when people ask "How did you two meet?" We go to weddings for the pleasure of seeing how nice everyone and everything looks, to be moved by hearing another couple recite those familiar meaningful vows, and to enjoy the company of old and new friends. Please don't make us listen to detailed stories of how you met or revealing explanations of your personal feelings. That is too much like making us attend amature theatrics. <br>  <br>  At most, edit your story down to a 40 second toast to each other.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best wishes.

K1oOQqqVaa	It's all about the way that you frame it.  If I was you I would tell him - <br>  <br>  "I want to have a baby.

Five years down the road he still won't want kids.  If you really want children you'll have to end the relationship.|`|5nAnWp3daa	y|`|3bpwLPxjaa	That is the wrong way to go about it.  If you want to go to a sperm bank, than you can as a single woman.  Going to that extreme is saying " I love you, but I want a baby more."  If that is how you feel, then you should do it on your own before you do it with a man who doesn't want kids!!!  Its a lifestyle HE has the right to choose!<br>  <br>  Would you be with a man who choose to have a kid with another woman, because you are the one who doesnt want kids???  think about it.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	IT? Real moms call them babies until you learn what a child really is maybe you should hold off. And once you are thirty-five maternity is much riskier; i.e. downs syndrome I had my son at twenty one he had a high risk of ds and I was scared to death I didn't want to give him up as he is a gift from god to me but I wasn't sure I would have what it takes to raise a ds child. You face a much more increased risk after thirty five so make your mind up soon for the sake of any babies you may birth.
AA11265589	Interesting that I just facilitated a workshop on Personal space in the workplace and hugging was one of the topics.  There are several types of hugs and allergy or not, most hugs are inappropriate.  First, there is the hug that you give to relatives and people you know well.  Then there is the pretend hug which the people hardly touch and basically go through the motions.  Then there is that too long hug that generally comes from someone from the opposite sex and just lasts too long. There is also the patting hug which the person pats your back.  This is a pity hug.   Hugging in the workplace is never appropriate.  Try the handshake with one hand covering the other if you need to let a person know that you feel something for them. This is a bit more hygienic.   There is no shame in telling a person that you do not hug.  It is no different than some people who do not shake hands.  Once you have told a few people, the word will get around and you may be pleasantly surprised how many people who will approach you and tell you that they too are uncomfortable with hugs for a variety of reasons.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	This one is a tough one. No matter what you do you will probably be attacked with a hug one way or another. But try giving high fives! It still puts people in awesome moods. <br>  If someone happens to hug you, explain to them it can't happen again because of your allergic reactions. <br>  It isn't such a terrible thing to back away from a hug when you have a legit reason to.|`|w9W3wPCOaa	LOL at the dude who posted on top of me. like that dosent fix anything, people will get away from u thinking this **** is contagious or something LOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways, just like, gah IDK tought question =/ im sorry to hear. <br>  <br>  Just tell them when they come up to you.. say like, im alergic to perfume and ****, are you wearing any? if they say no : then continue with the hugging?

EVERYONE has bills.  thats not a good enough reason  to keep someone.<br>  <br>  and to Amy, somewhere above me.  ever heard of At Will states where they can fire you for anything?  i live in one.  a former coworker of mine got fired because she had dandriff in her hair.  if you live in an At Will state, they can take any tiny thing into consideration about why they will fire you.  the only things that are not legal to fire for are age, race, and religion.  and even THOSE things can be taken into consideration depending on how many employees a company has.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Chicago Lawyer is not completely right.  It all depends where you live.  Not every state is an at-will state.  Labor agreements may remove at-will conditions.  In some places (like the CITY OF CHICAGO!) it's illegal to discriminate against a person based on sexual orientation. You can't discriminate against a woman based on pregnancy.  In Illinois, you can't discriminate against someone based on marital status.  The list is nearly endless (though it is true that you could fire someone because you don't like their purple hat). <br>  <br>  You may well get into trouble by choosing who stays based on family obligations if there is a disparate impact on one gender or age group over the other, as examples.  Say, if the policy to keep on men who owe child support, or people with young children means that women and older people as groups are laid off in disproportionate numbers, then you may be on the wrong side of discrimination laws.<br>  <br>  As a VP of Human Resources, I say you must use a transparent process.  That may be performance and seniority.  It may be that jobs that are paid more within a position are eliminated.  It may be that an entire unprofitable division goes.  Whatever it is should be a transparent process with a business reason to support it.  Keeping someone because they have children is not a business reason, and would be a foolish basis for determining layoffs.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	First i would consider how necessary ttheir position is. Then their job performance. I am 99.9% sure it is illegal to pick how to lay off someone because of their private life.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Work performance and seniority.  And with saying that, I'm off to get back to my job LOL.<br>  <br>  EDIT - C-Lawyer is right.  I work for the Dept. of Labor.  It's true. (U.S. only)|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It should be last hired, first laid off - and up the ladder that way.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	all things being equal i would suggest everyone share a pay cut either in wages or hours - however i've worked in places where the boss has paid others more than some just because they are men or because they have huge financial obligations - i think it unfair that i got less because i kept my debt-load down to almost nil - i think it unfair that my supervisor was paid less than other men because he had a good marriage and didn't pay child support and i think it was totally unfair to be paid less because i was a woman and didn't need as much money as men!  <br>  as an employer if all my employees were good ones i would gather them around and ask them all to take a cut in order to keep them all working and hope that they saw the logic in it.|`|crxbob5jaa	work performance and tenure|`|R7b150Iyaa	I think in the case of layoffs, companies always say that they are based on performance but that is not always the case.  I work at a huge firm and they just laid off 10% of our marketing department of 350 people last monday.  Some people were shocked that they knew someone who got laid off who's been here for 20 years, or won a chairman's award, etc.  Meaning, the cuts had nothing to do with performance but rather specific positions that had to be eliminated.<br>  <br>  In our European offices, they cut everyone's pay by 20% or put them on a 4 day work week (essentially the same thing) and I would rather having them do that than lay people off, as well.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't think personal financial background ever influences the higher ups' decision to lay people off unless it concerns families.  If you have two people in the exact same position with comparable work performance and one has a wife and child and one's single, the single one is more likely to get cut because he doesn't have anyone to support.  Sad but true.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped! =)|`|vCZuh3oDaa	I would not consider their personal financial background one bit.<br>  <br>  But I would consider much much more than simply their work performance.  For example, how necessary or valuable is the work they do for the company?  Is their skill set very unique and particular, or can it be absorbed by others? etc.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Amy is wrong.  It is not illegal to choose your layoffs based on personal life.  It's just that no smart company would ever do this.  You can actually get fired for lots of things:  because the boss just doesn't like you, or hates your purple hat, because you are homosexual, or because she just feels like it-- all of those reasons are legal.  That's the nature of at-will employment.  On a federal level, the ONLY things you cannot be fired for are age, sex, race, national origin, religion, or disability-- and that's only if your employer has 15 or more employees.<br>  <br>  EDIT to cupcake:  No I am not mistaken.  I clearly stated that this rule applies to "at-will employment" at a "federal level."  Yes labor unions can eviscerate this, but then it's not an at-will arrangement anymore-- it's a contractual one.  Furthermore, some examples you cite are not federal rights, but metropolitan ordinances.  Very different.  You shouldn't confuse the two.
76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	last weekend I went to a wedding that was beautifully done.  the invitation had like 4 inserts, which I thought was overkill.  but one of them listed 2 hotels in the 3 figure range.  that's not really that high a price for the city the wedding was in.  I didn't stay at either of them because I found something cheaper but I don't think you have to list more than 2 or 3.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I think it's a great idea, and would actually put it on a little index card, ADDITION to the invitation.  Maybe the same size as your RSVP cards.  And, I would actually include them in everyones invites... Even if people live close to the reception hall, they still might want to crash somewhere.  :)<br>  <br>  And, for how many hotel suggestions...  I think 8 to 9 would be fine!!  It's a handful, but it helps give them a better idea.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to narrow it down, I would suggest 3-4 hotels is plenty.  :)|`|cGbTJobeaa	That's too many. One is sufficient.  Really.<br>  <br>  Get a group rate at one hotel and have them reserve a block of rooms for you. They can do this and it will not cost you any money.  Send them info on one hotel and one hotel only.<br>  <br>  Why you ask? Because that way you can go to the one hotel and spend time with your out of town guests without having to go stop at 8 - 9 hotels. Plus, you can work with the hotel to tell you which guests utilized your group rate. Then you can have a gift bag of goodies (bottled water, chips, candy) given to them upon check in.<br>  <br>  It saves a lot of stress for you and allows you to add special touches for you without a huge inconvenience.  If it is out of someone's price range, they can make their own arrangements.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	id say three or four. that should be enough for you to pick one or two from every price range.  otherwise it starts to get overkill with the inserts.<br>  <br>    also make sure to ask the hotels if you get any kind of discounts for blocking rooms with them.  some hotels can block a certain number of rooms so guests can stay closer together and they usually offer some kind of discount if they book and say they are part of soandso's wedding|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I would suggest 3 or 4.  ALSO, you should talk to those hotels about blocking rooms at a discounted rate for your guests - - they still pay for their own room, but you negotiate a discount if your guests book at that hotel.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	I would say 2 or 3 at various price points.  At least one should be an economically-friendly option.|`|F3i6UUKYaa	I've used www.priceline.com several times to book hotels for myself when going to friends weddings.

Also you may have to file for it and if so you can do it for pretty cheap. It will only cost like 300 if you get the right info. Good luck!|`|vfQDSrAMaa	Have you filed for a divorce?

htWw0OlCaa	That's going to be tough on your part to deal with. The heart cant help who it loves and if you have loved this girl this long, and with her even married with a child, she must really be special.... I would suggest to be your self when she comes, try not to show the jealousy, I know that will be hard. And I know that there will be times that you can talk to her without her husband around. Tell her how you feel even after all these years. You never know, she may feel the same thing for you as well. Im not going to tell you to get into another relationship because it wouldn't really work for you, not when you still have her in your heart. But maybe seeing her and her husband, and let's not forget about the child, and if she tells you that she doesn't feel the same about you, it just might help you to get over her. But Im pulling for you, I hope you can get her and she will be all yours. Best wishes|`|e9YFTyzZaa	You've received some STRANGE, yet Good Advice........<br>  <br>  WHY in HELL did you INVITE Her & Family to stay with you.

If you really do care about her, let it go. She deserves to be happy so why make her and yourself miserable by pursuing your infatuation with her? She has her own life and a family, let her live it her way. By meddling, you may very well destroy a friendship. <br>  <br>  Don't give up on other relationships. I think you may go into them too seriously. Lighten up! Just go out and have fun. Treat women as friends, not prospects.|`|Rsrg0Ag6aa	i think u should just talk about it with her to see if she feels the same way. obviously not in front of her husband. but even if she does, i dont think she can really just leave her husband & daughter.<br>  good luck with that :||`|9CMGO5fhaa	I am so sorry. I really know how you feel I lost a great love of my life too. Recently I met up with him and have contemplated on leaving my husband for several weeks. I love and respect my husband but I just love the other guy so much I can't help myself. We've all known each other for about eight years or so now well me and my husband know each other and me and the other guy also have known each other for a while. I could not imagine spending the rest of my life knowing that I love someone else. I feel like I am cheating on my hubby even though I'm not. I couldn't tell you how to deal with all that if I wanted too because I am one of those people who follows what their heart tells them to. Maybe you could follow your heart and do as it tells you to.|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	Hello, it is obvious that she never loved you as more than a good friend.<br>  This should be very clear because she didn't respond for eleven years and one would think, if she loved you she would have protested against her marriage to her parents. You say she fell in love with you before she got engaged; how do you know that it was not out of weariness or submissiveness that she agreed to your wishes?<br>  <br>  It seems to me that she is happily married now. If you really love her, you will not wish to create problems in her marriage or break her marriage- you will want her to be happy! Just be normal and casual with her husband and her or even better, let them stay somewhere else.<br>  <br>  Don't get into another relationship if you don't want to, but for heaven's sake, get a life!|`|PVpHZ6XCaa	You must respect the marriage above all else.  <br>  <br>  Now, if she says that she is getting a divorce, be her friend through it---but nothing more until after she is divorced, AND says she is ready for another relationship.<br>  <br>  If she has no plans of divorce, this means she is in love wither her husband now.  If you truly love her, you will give her what she wants---which is her marriage.<br>  <br>  Why are they staying with you?  Is this something that can be changed?  It would be extremely hard for you to tolerate, and for her, too, if she is still in love with you.  It is setting up a bad situation!  =oP<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you! =o)
iPNOVR6Gaa	I cheated on her.  Not only that, it was in my office at work, a co-worker heard us, and reported us to the boss.  I not only got fired, I lost my career as a result, and had to start a new one.<br>  <br>  We got past it by me taking full responsibility for what I had done, getting some help, and doing some serious growing up and re-committing to our marriage.  After much anguish and hardship, lasting for months, my wife finally did forgive me, for which she has my eternal gratitude.<br>  <br>  That was well over 10 years ago, and today we love each other in our solid and happy marriage.  I feel certain that I didn't appreciate her before I cheated on her as much as I do now.  Sometimes fools like me don't know what they have until they are faced with losing it.<br>  <br>  Edit for blazingquill: I have now given you a thumbs up - you're awesome!|`|Bc4udMhUaa	3 months after having our daughter I caught the flu. I had a fever of a 105 and was literally freaking out. I couldn't handle myself let alone the colic baby. I called him and asked him to come home as soon as he could. He ended up going to shoot pool with a friends after work and getting drunk. My parents ended  up coming over my mom stayed with the baby, my dad took me to the dr who told me to go right the hospital where I was then admitted. I am still upset about it (that was about a year and a half ago). I was horrified he didn't take me seriously and extremely embarrassed that I had to call my parents b/c my husband was MIA.<br>  <br>  Oh, um how are we today? We are okay. He still has a bit of a Peter Pan complex. I don't bring up that little episode and try not mention the other donkey things he has done. I keep it in my head this is who I chose and I have to accept him for who is and focus on the good things he brings to the table.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	He lied to me!<br>  <br>  He tried to fake a affair to see how i would feel. When we dated i kissed a ex boyfriend because i was confused. to get back at me he lied about having a affair with another woman jsut to see how i would feel about it. I knwo he didnt do it but at the time i was so pissed. we talked about it alot and now we have been together for 6 years and happily married for 3. i am not a cheater i was just young and dumb i was 19 when this happened.|`|AA11635397	my husband is fantastic. well the worst...... i'd really have to think about it. Well i don't think its the worst, but i was at the hospital recently and our newborn was with us so he had to go home real quick, which is only 2 minutes away to make more bottles for the baby and to bring my medicine which i REALLY NEEDED. not only did it take him an hour to come back but he forgot my medication!! boy was i mad. but of course i got over it and we finally left the hospital happy|`|ByUS0k8waa	We got into a huge fight about something and he threatened to call my family. Which would be on his side not mine. We've been married three years and he will still pull that card if we are in one of those big fights or just gets sick of my talking about something. When he got home from deployment he was a different person and threatened to divorce me for no reason at all.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	He freaked out (unprovoked) one day and accused me of trying to live off of him...<br>  <br>  Long story short - I've done more supporting of him then he has done of me.  I have been the breadwinner for more than 80% of our relationship (and okay with that) and very steady in my employment...he was for some stupid reason taking his mother's way of living and projecting it on me...it was the last straw.  I work hard for the money I earn and pride myself on being able to support our entire family if ever I had to.  That completely pissed me off and some!<br>  <br>  I kicked his butt our of our bedroom and told him to come see me after he goes back to counseling...and he did...and his counselor put him in his place and got him to regroup...and 6 months later we managed to patch it up.<br>  <br>  Ugh!  That's the worst it's ever been for us and trust me - it's been pretty bad from time-to-time.  I just couldn't understand where he was coming from and why...completely out of left field and completely inappropriate.<br>  <br>  We do have separate bank accounts now (which he suddenly hates...too bad!) and that's about it.  I have forgiven him but I haven't forgotten.  I mean it's one thing when you've done something but another when it's completely unprovoked!  But, does it rule my everyday life?  No, it's part of forgiveness - getting past it and moving on with your life.|`|kyqhMuSiaa	9 years into our relationship he had a one night stand. Although it hurt at the time, we are the closest we've ever been and our marriage is better.

He planned to leave me for her because he thought when he came clean I would kick him out.  I didn't do that I asked him to let me try to win his love.  We are still working very hard every day to get past it but I think we will survive.<br>  <br>  Together 24 years<br>  Married 20 years<br>  2 months since news of affair<br>  <br>  The final outcome is To Be Determined but I am confident with our willingness to communicate with each other that we will make it and be better together than ever.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	There are so many...but a few: <br>  He cheated on me. Actually moved his gf into our home (I thought we were just helping her through her divorce...)<br>  He tried to get me to meet up with strangers for sxx and videotape it for him.<br>  He put me in unsafe positions. Dragged me to after-parties and would send me out to wait in the car when I was feeling sick so he could stay and 'party'<br>  He posted pics of me that he had taken (I thought for us) on the internet on public adult sites.<br>  He traded his wedding band up for a Rolex the week after our wedding (you'd think I would have figured out then what a douche he was)|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Honestly, nothing noteworthy.<br>  <br>  He is a good and solid Catholic Man.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	he had a drunken one night stand 9 months into our marriage.<br>  <br>  We are still married, and after seeking my immediate forgiveness and God's forgiveness we sought counsel from our pastor and we have healed our marriage.  2 1/2 years later we are happier than ever and the proud parents of a beautiful 11 month old daughter.  I got pasted it by believing that God works all things together for good for those that love Him and are called according to His purpose.  I got through it by forgiving my husband and accepting his humanity and realizing that no matter what had happened God could heal us and He did!<br>  <br>  BTW I can say this with no shame at all because I know that God is good and I will speak all day of His mercies for anyone what wants to hear.<br>  <br>  WOW REALLY?!! I get a thumbs down for forgiving my husband but Happy2 gets a thumbs up for the exact same scenario with the exception of being the man?!  What a double friggin standard!<br>  <br>  Edit: Happy2 thank you!! And it's good to hear that my husband and I are not alone and being that we have only been married 3 1/2 years it is encouraging to hear that you are both doing so well!!<br>  <br>  Amen Valerie!!! I think if God can forgive me of my sins than who am I to hold anything against my husband!|`|IqtzkgyBaa	Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness the creative force out of which life comes. To truly love is to live and to have true life is to exist in true loveLust is a passionate or overmastering desire. <br>  <br>  It is sad to say, that most of our marriages are conceived in lust. Therefore, when this overmastering desire is fulfilled, the marriage ends. The true life of marriage is based in the quality of love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.<br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of(God). In the Bible,  (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new<br>  <br>  What is  (God’s) view of the female? She is the manifestation of His attribute of mercy to the world. She is undeserved kindness to us, for, through her we are extended through the generations. It is only through her that we live again, and again, and again.<br>  <br>   It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building.  Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come.|`|IvMPh09baa	he lied to me.<br>  <br>  we got past it by talking to each other ALOT....

That is when, and that is only when he listened to me fully and understood his behavior and actions were wrong.  I had to tell him how it made ME feel without accusations and telling him he was wrong.  Its all about communication and communicating with feelings not accusations.<br>  <br>  we are great today...! thanks for asking.<br>  <br>  how are you today?|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He lied about qutting smoking, and I was FURIOUS at him.

So it would be better for you to ask help from your foster mom, try to ask her what is the truth about your real parents..It is your right to know them, right?

One for your family, one for his and one for all! parties are fun. they do not have to be big or expensive, just some food, folks and fun. I say do all three, and do not hold back....Invite his folks to the original one and if they can not make it then plan a little exlusive thing for them and your parents...a dinner with the parents thing that is nice and quiet...there are too many things you could do....but you do not have to accomodate everyone with one date! I say party on...and on...and on....LOL!|`|AA10975867	As an engagement party is for PARENTS to announce the wedding date and introduce the prospective son or daughter to the family, you should be having the party when both sets of parents are there.

No gifts required either. congrats.|`|0AShsMsoaa	put it off until may.  that is the only acceptable thing.  this was too short of a notice, and, you did not clear it with the grooms parents first.  one does not set a date for an engagement party unless the brides and grooms families are available.  so i dont understand how this date got set in the first place.  if you wait til may you have more time to do it right, and the time will fly by.      trust me.|`|cGbTJobeaa	It's more important for your future in-laws to be there.

What do you mean by that it might be the last time she gets to go ... is he sick?  If it's not a big deal for her to change the date of her trip, then have the party March 14 if she can make it.  Otherwise, can you put off your engagement party a little longer til school is out?  Colleges let out by May, so perhaps you could have the party then.  My fiance and I got engaged just before Christmas too, and our wedding is set for June 12, 2010.  However I am in my last term of University and will be graduating in April, and my fiance is very busy with work and will be going to Greenland until May (he is in the military).  Plus we live about five hours from my family and across the country from my fiance's parents, so rather than having an engagement party now, we are waiting til the Spring and are going to have an engagement/graduation party that my MOH is planning.

I'd play it as one of the songs before the processional, when the ceremony is about to start. You could have the DJ play it again at dinner, or as a slow dance. It just won't take you enough time to walk down the aisle to get anywhere in the song. They'll have to cut it off in the middle of a verse, or let it play to the end while everyone just stands there. You need a song that can easily be trimmed to however long it takes you to walk down the aisle, which is why most people go with something instrumental. Doesn't mean it can't suit your taste in music... but I wouldn't pick something with words.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well I like Slipknot but I have a little more class than to play that at my wedding.

It might seem flattering that some older man is interested in you but you are 13 and ONLY boys your age should be interested in you. <br>  <br>  I have a 9 yo daughter and if this was happening to her, this pervert would either be in jail or a pine box by now.<br>  <br>  It good to reach out to your online "friends" but much more important to tell your parents, family and school officials NOW!!!!!<br>  <br>  Believe it that he does not care how you feel. Fear for your safety and the safety of other girls in your area and get help.|`|I7zocOEnaa	well first off he shouldn't be asking if you want a ride how dose he know you have math maybe you should talk to your parents as nice as this guy may seem he could be a stalker I'm not joking so talk to your parents. <br>  <br>  Also just say "I'm sorry sir but I'm really busy and I gotta go now" then walk off <br>  <br>  Or, "I'm sorry sir but I have to go now" Just act busy<br>  <br>  But talk to your parents I'm not jokeing this could be bad.<br>  <br>  (Tip: if he dose ANYTHING that you think is wrong Ex. grab you ask personal info just run/scream or run and scream)|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Have you told an adult?  Tell your parents right away.  They need to arrange a ride for you to and from school.  You shouldn't be walking alone for now.  He's a weird old guy.  Don't worry about offending him.  Girls and women are always afraid to offend people and we end up getting hurt.  FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.  This doesn't sound like a safe situation for you.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	from what you said, he sounds dangerous...what if he has a record for this? You should report it, if not for your sake, for others.

But keep a phone with you incase he is a freak.Or keep a weapon,ONLY IF HE MAKES A BIG MOVE.|`|9scpRClxaa	Don't worry about offending him.  Just tell him firmly to leave you alone and if he does not, please, please, please inform your parents, a teacher, and/or (and maybe especially) the police.  He is harassing and stalking you.  A 40 year old guy should have nothing to do with a 13 year old girl without some prior relationship--such as he's her dad/stepdad/uncle/teacher, etc. and then only within certain limits.  You owe him nothing for helping you with your binder besides a thank you--which he already got.|`|DNUPVvioaa	Are you that stupid go tell your parents! He's a freakin pervert go do something! go tell the cops if you have to. What kind of 40 year old man asks little girls if they need a ride! Get some sense so your mind clicks that he's trying to lure you to him to i don't know..maybe rape you! You should be scared for your life please get some brains. If this is just you being stupid on purpose then it's not funny|`|NlIsXIdWaa	he's a stalker! stop telling him things!<br>  <br>  lets just say you were a stalker, how would you get little boys and girls? and how would you get into their house and steal stuff? by being nice and asking questions but not being too obvious of course, <br>  <br>  and he wanted you to DRIVE with him, thank goodness you said no, I don't mean to scare you but tell your parents right away, after they know this they will probably bring you to school and back, if not, ask a friend to drive you, your parents will probably figure something out.<br>  <br>  and to answer the question about him knowing you had math class, he could of grabbed something with your information in it when he was helping you that one day, or there's a lot of possibilities. <br>  <br>  so what you should do is: keep saying no to walk with him, drive with him, or go anywhere with him, if you ever do see him again always keep a couple feet away from him just say your in a hurry and go, and do not tell him anymore information, when he asks about your house or anything, answer him by lying. but most importantly, TELL YOUR PARENTS
D2cCZVQXaa	The more you're there for her, the better it should be. Other wise she's doing it for attention. Tell her to keep her chin up cause there's always something good out there. You can make things happen if you try. But giving up wont make anything better. Point out things that you know make her happy. Have her rediscover herself. To better herself. If she still acts suicidal... then it's time to explain how selfish shes being for wanting to ruin something that can be fixed. And not all guys are the same. Don't let another person get you down because of something they've said or done. That's their decision and loss, so there's no point in worrying about someone who will treat anyone else with no respect. Always remember that karma is a b****.|`|aIFfOrFSaa	talk to her about it, all you can do to help is be a good friend to her, be there for her when she needs you.<br>  tell her your there for her, to listen to her problems or just a chat.<br>  try and add a bit of humour to make her feel bettter, and tell her how much of a prick the guy is.<br>  <br>  in experience of having depression being with my friends was the best way of curing it. also just having a laugh or maybe a cry with them is better than keeping it bottled up inside.<br>  <br>  so just be there when she needs you for a shoulder to cry on or a friendly face.|`|sFXla2gIaa	sounds like a downer.. no but really, i had a friend who was severly depressed and threatened not joked about suicide. i think you should be by their side and make them realize that you love them.

The group as a whole feels validated when it confronts a common threat or puts down people who don't belong to their group. It makes the members feel unique, superior, powerful, and more bonded. It doesn't do anything for friendships with people outside the group. <br>  <br>  There are, on the other hand, groups that focus on doing good things for other people, but then, they don't buy into a "in-group/out-group" mentality.|`|mCbChkKraa	We all have subconscious traumata which disturb our upper consciousness and our behavior.

chENztVEaa	You need to talk him into seeking help  from his doctor, but you need to let him know that you are going to have zero tolerance for this kind of behavior from here on out.  Catch him in a good mood sometime really soon and explain to him exactly what you have explained to us.  Your daughter and yourself deserve to live in a safe zone.  ask him what he would do if he caught your daughter's husband choking her when she is older, then explain to him the effects he is having on her morals and what she is going to expect from her husband.  If you leave he is not going to gain custody of your daughter since he is an abuser. If the talk doesn't help than call the police and let him know you are serious and not going to take abuse from him any longer.  Just because you don't have marks doesn't mean the police aren't going to believe you.  Many abusers know how to be effective without leaving visual marks and authorities are already aware of this, plus any compliant will be kept on file.  You have taken the first giant step and that is admitting there is a problem in your home.  Now as a parent it is your responsibility to do something about it.  Be strong for your daughter and remember she is the most important thing in your life.  Good luck to you and remember you are not alone.|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	This is what you said:<br>  <br>  "I am to the point that I feel that If I don't I'm putting my daughter in harms way even though he has never harmed her, I didn't think that he would harm me."<br>  <br>  If you didn't think he would ever harm YOU, what makes you think he won't harm our daughter then?<br>  <br>  I am sure that the seizure medication helped to some degree, but I can bet any money you were still scared everytime he was around you and possibly showing signs of potential violence against you. I dont care how bad his seizures are, he's still hurting you!<br>  <br>  I would call the doctor and I would also call a therapist to help HIM out. Sounds like he has some serious issues that may go deeper than just seizures.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	It sounds like he has an underlying psych problem known as "manic-depression".  The seizures alone (epilepsy) will NOT make him violent or violatile.  He is using that as an excuse to be abusive.  His condition is his crutch.  And you are training him to treat you this way.  Every time you forgive him and stay with him, you are telling him that it is okay to hit/push/scratch/punch you.  You have given him silent permission to do this and behave this way.  Where there is a wil there is a way.  If you truly want to get out of this mess, you will.  This situation NEVER gets better, it only gets worse.  And think of the example you are setting for your child.  You are saying to your child that it is okay to hit women and that it is okay to take being hit.  I feel for your child.

yh2hr3Vfaa	Here is my advice. I am a retired Chief Petty Officer.<br>  <br>  I advise you to marry this young lady asap. I assume she is living with her parents for the moment. After you get married and have her on your page 2 and deers apply for base housing. The housing office can give you an idea how long the wait will be. <br>  <br>  The obvious reason being it is much cheaper to live on base. I am assuming your an SA or SN. Things will be tight until you make PO3, but manageable. Plus you will have to pay for the move since you were not married when you received your orders.<br>  <br>  Look around, if the base housing wait is too long look for something affordable. If you do take a place off base make sure they have a military clause just in case. The housing referral office also has listings for rentals and most of them prefer to rent to active duty.<br>  <br>  You sound mature enough and seem to have your priorities straight. I have seen it work for other couples your age. Just keep momma  your first priority when your home and the ship your first when your deployed.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck. Next time don't ask here. Ask your LPO or Chief for advice. That's one of the things we are there for.<br>  If you don't feel comfortable talking to your COC then talk with the Chaplin or e mail me. Good luck Shipmate.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Just give it to God and he will do all the work.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	.. just be happy with what you have ...and your reward is her ..mate i wish you all the best .. and the family as well...|`|ByUS0k8waa	Ok when my husband and I got married we talked and both decided that divorce isn’t never a option unless one cheats. That is the way we believe and when you take the option of divorce out of the picture you can get though anything. Also if she can get though a deployment you guys can get though anything. Trust me my husband deploys for alot longer (12-15 months) and that is the true test of a relationship. Once you get though that is easy as pie. Just remember to always make her feel special. When your gone don’t tell her and send flowers for no reason at all but because you love her. <br>  <br>  Also write love notes. Just because your married doesn’t mean that you have to stop flirting and telling each other you love them in special ways. You should talk alot. When you have a problem talk it out.<br>  <br>  The biggest rule of a happy marriage is to never go to bed mad. Always have the great make up sex even if your to tired. Remember that tomorrow isn’t always going to be there. Live each day like your deployed tomorrow. Trust me Im a army wife and ex soldier. This are some of the keys you will learn to keep a happy marriage and the relationship alive. Also at least once a week when your home do something special and show her how much she means to you. Weather its picking up your favorite snack, flowers for no reason, a love note left in her hand bag, or a wonderful foot rub or back rub. <br>  <br>  If you love her marry her and live your life together. Love will concur all!!!|`|IvMPh09baa	your trying to conceive at 18 and then planning on leaving for the military?... wow... don't get me wrong, I am proud and thankful for your wanting to join the military... but don't you think your a little young for a baby?  Seriously... why don't you spend this time away without the stress of a child!<br>  <br>  enjoy life with her and your baby?HAHA!  you'll be in bootcamp and then shipped off possibly to war... so what time do you plan on having for her and the baby????|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	military is hard enough, marraige on top of it takes a lot of work. She will have to be ready for anything, deployments, moving around teh world a lot and not being able to hear or see you for long lengths of time. if you are both trustworthy and want to get married and work in the military there are things that can help. webcams, daily letters, emails, care packages and love notes. Communication is the key to every good marriage and i wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  thanks for serving our country|`|AA11635397	you are a great man and yes have a family with her ok. You stay faithful to her ok and let her see how much you love her. Get married soon ok please. Stay strong. My husband and i are both in the military and we got married at 18, 19 and we are now almost 21 with one little baby boy. Its the greatest thing ever. We are stationed together making it even better|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Well for starters, attitude is key so don't start out thinking "I don't want to divorce" - that implies that it's even an option in your mind.  My dad told me once that an important key to a healthy, wonderful marriage is for both to ask themselves "what can I do to make my partner feel loved" just once a day.  When both people in the marriage are focused on making each other's days better, being there for each other, including them in decisions, etc....it inevitably makes the other person feel loved & important.  The focus shouldn't be "how can I keep my marriage from falling apart."  Instead, if you focus on always making your fiance feel loved, supported, remembered, honored, etc, then you won't have to worry about your marriage falling apart.  Obviously she has to focus on the same - it takes TWO to make a marriage really wonderful.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is this: before you ship off on any deployments, sit down with her and discuss the following:<br>  <br>  1) What are her expectations?  You need to give her realistic expectations.  If she thinks you'll be free to email, chat, or talk on the phone anytime she wants, that's a pipe dream.  Walking her through what to expect will help her understand & feel included in the process.<br>  <br>  2) Walk her through what you'll be doing - what a typical day will be like for you.  If you don't know that yet, then it's important to do that when you do get over & have a chance to speak to her.  Wives just want to know what's going on - but spare her any gory details of you being in danger, that will just make her worry more.<br>  <br>  3) Talk about finances - who is going to pay the bills?  <br>  <br>  4) Talk about how the 2 of you are going to keep things strong while you're away - by this, I mean, come up with real ideas!  Will you send a love letter to her once a week?  Will you call her once a week?  Perhaps she can send a care package to you once a month or something. Go ahead & agree on a few romantic things you can do to keep each other feeling loved & appreciated.  Then go beyond that when it comes to what you actually do.  If she asks you to write her once a week, do more.  Go online & order her flowers (you can from www.proflowers.com).  The internet makes it possible to have surprises delivered to her!  <br>  <br>  And finally, just put her mind at ease by telling her how much she is loved and promising to be faithful to her.  You will find that SOME military guys stray while they are deployed because 1) they don't have a good marriage to begin with or 2) they can get away with the wife never knowing.  But you be better than that.  My mom always said that "who you are is shown by how you act when no one else is looking."  Show her that you are a trustworthy, honorable person.<br>  <br>  Goodluck & thank you for seving our great country.
8XKmMBU7aa	Why don’t you want to watch TV<br>  Please Start watching TV, movies, You Tube etc.<br>  Ideas will automatically come in your mind.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I don't think boys are an issue - you did say there was lesbian porn in there?<br>  <br>  Also, I think you're jumping the gun a little bit. She's interested in sex, it's natural at 16. She's using a dildo, which is very sensible, and much much safer than having sex with boys who may or may not care about wearing condoms and may or may not be conscientious about the spread of nasty diseases.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you tell her what you found, and ask her if there's anything she wants to tell you. Emphasise that you are more concerned for her health and safety, don't go all moral or anything. My point is that if you get all 'you're a slut' on her, she won't talk to you at all, and this will close down all lines of communication. Don't mention internet cam sessions or anything like that, just keep the focus on health and safety. If there is anything you do need to know about, then she is more likely to tell you if you are not hostile to the possibility that she may be experimenting with sex.|`|6xEpscamaa	Well, if your story is true, I wouldn't worry THAT much about it.  I was masturbating at 13 and nothing's wrong with masturbation.  You should have a talk about sex with her, and tell her that if she is sexually active she needs to protect herself.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	OMG I would have died if my dad ever found out what i was up to at that age! A good talk about sex and safe sex um no matter if it is a girl or boy is probably in order. Let her know she can rely on you and talk about anything no matter how embarrassing for either of you. Your daughter is really lucky to have a dad like you and good move on the gloves!|`|QRbCnBgFaa	DO NOT go up to her and ask her about the dildo and the porn stuff because i ASSURE you, she is going to be so embarrased, and then get angry.<br>  <br>  Maybe, leave a note on her bed telling her not to do that again. It's less hassle and less embarrasing.|`|pBVjKCJ1aa	Have a heart-to-heart talk with her.  16 year old's can be pretty tricky when it comes to giving them advice - they tend to clam up or sulk.  Take her to a coffee shop where you can talk to her in a private spot and then tell her you would like to approach her as a young adult.<br>  Speak to her about your fears, exactly as you have done here.  Use a lot of "I" language - "I feel"  "I am afraid" etc. so she does not feel you are judging her.<br>  If you visit <a href="http://www.drirene.com/contents" rel="nofollow">http://www.drirene.com/contents</a> - you will find an article to print out for her about how to recognise abusers on a first date.  This is just an example of the type of articles you could search for and print out to give her to read at her leisure.<br>  They feel invincible at this age - therein lies their vulnerability.  So she really needs you to help her through this stage.|`|wtdic2w7aa	Your daughter's sixteen. To be honest, she's old enough to deserve some privacy and IMO it would be better not to bring it up at all.<br>  <br>  That she is masturbating and viewing porn, does not automatically follow she is going to do something reckless with a webcam. It simply means she is sexually aware, not stupid enough to get into silly situations online. If you confront her about it you're only going to embarrass her and make her feel like you don't trust her to be responsible.|`|RRqIfDTfaa	OMG, wow your daughter is young and wild. Well there's not much you can do because you could say something but she's still possibly going to do it. That had to freak you out to see that. I cant imagine. I would leave it up to the mom to talk to her about that because it would be more comfortable for the both of you that way. Sorry you have to go through that. Good Luck|`|QAewZewYaa	Would you rather she had a boy stashed in her room?<br>  I had lots of porn and "tools" (some homemade!) at that age....didn't have a sexual relationship until much later because of it.  :)<br>  Don't embarrass her about what you found, but try and have a tactful chat about your webcam concerns.|`|J564M2AEaa	Drop hints that you know shes got all that porn. Maybe find a lady friend who shes close to to give her her 'sex talk'.<br>  The last thing she would probably want is her dad talking to her about that personal stuff. It will be hugely embarrassing!|`|cFhgBmTuaa	could be extremly embarrassing for her at 16. maybe you should take the stash and leave it at the end of her bed. that way she knows you have noticed it and want her to know you know, but she has a chance to broach the subject with you.|`|9vHR68jpaa	WOW! ok this is what i think u should do........u sould try to gain a big realationship with her..........get closer to her and when u feel as though u are super duper close.......pull out the magazines and ....TALK....... maybe just maybe she will tell u her story|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well tell her mom to talk to her  about it|`|Y4wQsBuUaa	WOW awkward much.... I feel bad for you. First of all, its pretty normal for girls to question their sexuality. I know a lot of friends (female and male) of mine who questioned in when we were younger and most have grown out of it. It is part of the culture we live in where it's "cool" to be gay or lesbian. Some people fake it or are led to questioning what they normally wouldn't because of all the media influence. So your daughter probably will not become a full fledged lesbian if that is what you're worried about. On the other hand, she could honestly be gay or bi and you need to think about how you are going to accept this. And you will need to accept it unless you want to completely alienate your daughter. Trust me, the less accepting you are the more she will hate you and be driven towards what she perceives as an "undesirable lifestyle". I think that it would be too awkward for you and her to talk about it, but were you to send her an email or write her a note explaining 1.that it was a complete accident that you found these items 2. that you don't approve, but you don't plan to humiliate her or take them away, 3. that if she would like to talk, then you are open, 4. if you have a sister or trusted female friend that she could talk to then you could suggest that, just try to stay distant from it because this is a really really awkward thing to discuss with your parents and especially your father. Don't come on too strong, but let her know that you know and while you don't approve you are still there to support and love her.

Do you know what love is?<br>  <br>   2.) do you believe in love?<br>  <br>   3.) what do u love about me? <br>  <br>   4.) how can you love me if we've known each other for just a few months?<br>  <br>  if he responds with a good answer to these questions then i think he does like you....<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|gcZSwvvUaa	just accept the "i love you" with happiness and hope it continues. don't go overboard, just let it be what it is.

I don't know if that's your intention or not, but the tone of writing definitely sounds like that.  Perhaps if you wrote more calmly and rationally, the people taking your mom's side (who I'm sure are parents themselves) would take you more seriously.  As for the guy dumping you because he can't see you during the week, is he really worth it if he acts like that?<br>  <br>  But the harsh reality is that you're under 18 and living in your parents' household.  So I'll be blunt: you're pretty much SOL for another 4 years, as far as the law is concerned.  I say tough it out; block out all the frustration from your mind, and get through high school with good grades.  Because then you'll be able to go away to college where you can make up in 4 months for the past 4 years.  And with good grades and SAT/ACT scores, you'll be able to get into the college of your choice, far from your parents' home.  Otherwise, you'll end going to a community college, which means living at home even longer.  So what's it going to be?|`|LBAh1tPoaa	You make a very good case for the post natal abortion argument.

If you say you will be home at 7:00 pm - be there at 7, if not before!<br>   - Treating your Mom (and all the members of your household) with respect.<br>  <br>  And, you have to do all those things for more than a day.  You need to do those things for a month.  Maybe more.  Because it is going to take time for your Mom to see that you are *really trying* to be responsible, and that you can be trusted.<br>   <br>  Last but not least, you might actually try TALKING to your Mom, like she's a real person.  You might be surprised at what happens.  Your Mom remembers exactly what it is like to be 14 - and that is why she wants you to be home at 8 pm.  She has known you since before you were born - remember, she grew you! - and so when she says "No", it might be - just maybe - because she loves you so much that she can't stand to think of you getting hurt.  Try to see it from her side.<br>  <br>  Regarding this boy - If the guy really does like you, he will understand.  If he doesn't - why would you want to be with someone who doesn't respect you and/or your Mom?<br>  <br>  And, BTW, not EVERYONE is allowed to go out.  I  promise.

See him after school and on the weekends.|`|AA11904226	Stay home and learn to spell|`|u1qgyGFNaa	lol calm down.want some chocolate milk kiddo? <br>  <br>  your mom is a good mom.
zxQT3Uo5aa	He likes you.  Wanna be with you is not the same thing.|`|fjOMthF1aa	Sounds like cupid is at work...|`|9f8a58d970a66b4ecccc6e2320c54473aa	I sometimes feel lonely with feelings of be hugged or even sex. and since i know that may not happen i know that a hand shake is a soft<br>  feeling on my hand its appreciated, without being stupid.if something<br>  more happens its a pluss.chance r he likes u but could not be sure<br>  w/o more info.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	yes.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	ummm yea he wants ur bod|`|QFEv8xSnaa	yessser :)<br>   duhhhhhh<br>  lmao hope i helped :)|`|F4eVMDqHaa	yeah.

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I say talk to her about how your 'feeling' but don't bash or put down her best friend. Just tell her that your feeling a little heartbroken, because you and your girl on the same page.|`|TBTYCDhVaa	I would personally say stay clear as you don't want her to get involved with it all.<br>  <br>  if you need advice or any more help just e-mail me, my e-mail address should be on my profile.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jixdk8wraa	Well, if I had a crush on my best guy friend I wouldn't want to know about it. But then I would. <br>  Just tell her. You need her help and she will get over it.<br>  Maybe you have feelings for her though? Otherwise, why would you be so concerned about how it will affect her?|`|4e0pOmt7aa	i would not like him to bring it up
AA12347234	He never should have kicked you. That was wrong. However, I do feel like you are overreacting just a bit.  I mean if he continues to be physical like that, then that would be considered abuse in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I would just talk to him about it and more than likely he will apologize. So I don't think you have anything to worry about.|`|blXMfxRsaa	I don't so, but it could be. The only thing you can do is watch for signs and if you see anymore get out before it gets bad.|`|YlnDhCpJaa	I wouldn't consider it abuse, not yet... Im mean that is pretty messed up of him to do that, like i can imagine him cussing and kicking you, and you just being there like half shocked and confused, all quiet and stuff, thats just mean... You were just playing with him!, but you kno how some ppl can get when they're super tired, they have a total disregard for anything and just wanna go to sleep... <br>  But still, I've smacked my girl kinda hard ( not meaning to but you girls are all delicate and crap!) and she looks at me like wtf? but i go right away to tell her SORRY BABE! :D... Well i suggest you tell him about it, when he's in a better mood and tell him if he didnt think that kick wuz gonna hurt you? Im pretty sure the kick didnt actually hurt, it wuz the way he did it that hurt ur feelings, just play it by ear and see wut he has to say about it, then take it from there... Sorry, i feel bad cuz ive dun that to my girl to :( but like i said i go right back at her like a little puppy to tell her im sorry lol... Bye|`|QQd1C9HGaa	nah chill he was just angry|`|jDLlZ4Fxaa	I would say it is...He shouldnt hurt you no matter what
