20090223074122AAKkAul	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	'99 Crown Vic / Grand Marquis: Underhood Insulation?	The fiberglass insulation which resides on the underside of the hood on my 1999 Crown Vic', was black/very dark gray, at one time however; over the years, she's become stained, dirty & a general engine-compartment eyesore! The sheet is in fine shape physically, it's just dirty-looking-- which really throws-off the near-immaculate condition in-which I keep the engine & associated under-hood components(!)   THE QUESTION: Can it be cleaned, w/ damaging it (or me)?   I want to try every avenue of possibility before having to resort to buying 1 from that d@m*3d dealership, b/c they want $4,925.67 for a new one <--[$ figure = slight exaggeration].      I've searched, in vain, through four different junkyards & the only insulators that were even clean-enough, were off previous model-year cars & the measurements didn't match-up to those on mine.      Any ideas, or is this just one o' those "suck-it-up & buy a new one", situations?      Thanks!

The past few days, when I reach say 70mph in my car, I hear and odd rattling noise.    The cars handling is not affected in any way by this so it is not to do with steering.

Has anyone else had this problem? I want to know what you think it might be, if its just a screw loose or something my Father can fix it.

I just recently replaced the intake manifold gasket on my 1985 civic.  It was leaking around 2 of the cylinders causing the spark plugs to lean out and get all crudded up with carbon and gasoline.  Well, after we fixed the intake leak and everything was running good again. Ran some carb cleaner through the engine and burned a TON of carbon out of it.  It runs like a totally different car now.......except.........the Idle speed is SUPER high now!  I guess it was so gunked up that the previous owner adjusted it to idle higher to compensate for all the sludge that was in there.  Does anyone know how I can lower the idle speed?  This is a 1985 honda civic 1.5 liter CARBURETED model.  Thanks a lot.

This morning I rear-ended a vehicle, it was not bad:   The vehicle was stopped and than the light turned green, the SUV in front of me accelerated quite quick and so I started to go, suddenly he stopped and I tried to in time but hit the metal adaptor to attach trailers and such to the back. His SUV was fine but my cars bumper is a bit cracked.   Is there anything I can do to fix it?    How much will  it cost?   PS: I have a 99' Honda Civic.

Saturday when we were driving to the mall, it seemed to have gotten stuck on a gear but then after awhile it would go up a gear and we drove it for 2 hours straight. After we were done at the mall, we tried it out and it didn't do that anymore. But then Sunday, after we drove it to somewhere where he had to do something for work, it did it again. Then when he dropped me off, he tried starting it up. It started to start up but then like putters out. What could be wrong? Oh and his check engine light was on.    Sorry if this is in the wrong section, I'm at school right now and they're computers don't let us do much.

20090223071228AAyAcjU	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	If your car is damaged while it is being worked on by a mechanic, is it their responsibility to fix it?	I recently brought my car into the shop because my power window would not go up. I ended up having the cable cut and the window taped shut for a temporary solution. When I picked up my car, I found that while they had my car, they cracked the plastic where the buttons are for the power windows. It looks like they attempted to super glue it. I called back and brought my car in immediately and they basically told me, "that happens." They said that they would not fix the part unless I was going to have them fix my window fully. Does this sound correct?      I didnt think that bringing my car into them should cost me even more damage.

20090223070511AAhLKoP	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Should I stop driving or keep trying to improve my driving?	I am a very very bad driver. I passed my drivers test somehow but I'm just terrible at it. I have a number of things working against me. I have an old eye injury that leaves me with a somewhat bad eye, and I have very poor depth perception. I have trouble telling how far away things are and how fast they are coming at me. I'm also on psychiatric medications for a mood disorder and I'm on mood stabilizers and anxiety medicine. Off the medicine I am panicky and over react and freak out too much, which makes it hard to drive. On the medicine I am groggy and I zone out a lot, which isn't so good.       I'm seriously a very bad driver. I try to take public transport whenever I can, but sometimes I find myself needing to go someplace out of the way or needing to haul back a good size load of groceries, and driving is a big part of being independent.       Is there a way I can improve my driving skills? Should I take a course and keep working on practicing, or should I hang up my keys?

20090223073157AAAd4Qt	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	How come truck drivers dont get the respect they deserve?	My husband is a truck driver and let me tell the money stinks. Everyone says whats the big deal how come they make all this money and all they have to do is drive. Well to those people go out get in your car and drive 4000 miles this week and never leave your car unless its to use the bathroom or eat. Sleep in your car and drive 14 hours straight wihtout sleep...do this for a year and then you can say what you want. Oh by the way do it all alone without anyone else there with you to talk to and converse with.    Trucks drivers are so under respected...yeah they might be grouchy sometimes and look unkept but you know what all of us would if we were driving a 60foot truck with millions of dollars worth of merchandise on it in traffic like say New York or Los Angelos....most of us cant even stand it in a car let alone trying to take said truck across four lanes of traffic to make your exit. They get flipped off and horns blowed at em all the time. Cars are constantly jumping in front of them and cutting them off and not stoping to think that the truck they just cut off needs alot more space to slow down than a regular vehicle. Here are some cons of being a truck driver that most people dont think about.      The money stinks unless your working for a very prominent company...not likely since when you decide the pay isnt enough they can always grab some kid outta school to do it for them at lower pay.      Unless your a company driver you have to pay all your fuel...think about spending 800 bucks for a fill up in a truck that gets about 10 miles per gallon.. you have to pay all your tolls,scales and for all the permits you need to go from one state to another...you have to pay to have your own authority and you have to pay for all repairs needed and regualr maintence..people complain about a 30 dollar oil change you should see the bill for an oil change on a semi. or new tires that wear out faster than normal cause your always moving.      You are self employed so you have to keep up with all your taxes and deductions all year. And you pay self employment tax which is double since you have no employer paying half like those with a 1040.      You are away from home 90% of the time missing holidays birthdays and you have no sick leave. If something happens that you need to take time off then no money comes in during that time.       You live out of a suitcase constantly truck drivers dont stay in motels they sleep in thier truck which can be a pain alot of the time...Yeah you can put in a TV or something but when would you ever have time to watch it? when your not driving your sleeping.       You might take a load to CA and half to sit and wait for days to get one back towards home cause you cant just turn around and go home if theres no loads. You would lose money that way.      The only pro at this point about being a truck driver is at least you have a job..some get lucky and land a good paying job driving but 7 outta 10 drivers are barely making it by. And they are doing it alone. They dont see thier kids and family for weeks sometimes.      So next time your out on the road and your thinking about cutting some driver off please think twice...you wouldnt have that car your in if a driver hadnt delivered it..in fact look around you right now and point out some things in your home that a truck driver didnt deliver at some point. If they all quit tommorow what would America do? Just alittle something to think about.
