2MfMyh4Maa	Everyone has to believe that their life has a purpose.  Like the first answerer, we may deny it at an intellectual level but deep down, our human nature demands it.      Purpose is tied to worth.  After all, we throw things away that serve no purpose.  Our human nature demands that we live lives worth living so that means we must have a purpose.    Purpose either comes from God or it comes from our imagination.  For those who accept that God might exist, then purpose is seen as first seeking God.    Unless you assume a God, the question of lifes purpose is meaningless. Bertrand Russell (noted 20th century atheist)    For those who reject God, they find things that give them some feelings of happiness and then pretend as if those things are the reasons to live.  It's a exercise in self deception.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	your purpose is to find out...search...start ....NOW|`|b453xLGiaa	Visualize it. Try. Just try. What to visualize? Jsut let your mind wander...

(p.s. - anyone under 50 = young). So, learn all you can in the early years, avoiding as much as possible anything that is a potential danger or harmful, either physically or mentally or spiritually. Eventually, there will come a time when you begin to seek the truth regarding the reality of life. These questions cannot be answered in colleges or universities. Nor can they be answered by mankind's best wisdom. The answers will be there for you to consider and then make choices about. These will be the most important decisions you make in your life.   Beyond that, just think carefully about what you really enjoy doing out of all the experiences you have had in the work-a-day world. Then choose a path that will lead you in the direction of what you truly enjoy doing. The best advice I ever had was that whatever you choose to do for a living, make sure you like it, or you will never find any peace in so far as earning a living.|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	That's the whole point of life.

TYzNTT7caa	Belief in God as you are conceiving of it is a Judeo-Christian concept. It presupposes a universe under one supreme power. However, the Greeks believed in a universe that existed under competing powers: thus there was a god of the sea, a goddess of wisdom, a god that delivered ideas or messages, a god that ruled the sun, and a god over other gods. None of them, not even the god of other gods, was supreme and pandemic the way the Judeo-Christian is conceived. Moreover, this belief, being split up, was both more pervasive and less dominant at the same time. It is a completely different mindset. The notion of "belief" is not the same.    None of these thinkers believed in the sense that modern people mean the term. Moreover, what we know about Socrates comes from Plato, so the questions about Socrates is really not so separate and sortable as your question implies.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Dont know About Plato    But The other 2 YES|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Who knows, the greeks had many gods but Plato Aristotle and Socrates may have been atheist.|`|72dc1a25da1d1e8925f61bf5bf941c91aa	Hi there, they  believed in the 12 Greek gods.

raU9c3tzaa	you are right, mek.  you remind me of my yesterday's answer to T.D. question : " would you lend an I to this effort?" me said :  "hope resides in next generation, for another will is coming, and tomorrow then would be another day, but we have to sweeten the bitter inheritance now, while waiting for the horizon womb to give birth to the new sunrise."    me have never thought that freedom would be within a reachable range.. we can only hope for something, and when it comes true, we may be enslaved by it. we try a cigarette.. enjoyed it.. got enslaved  to [what and whom] that may concern. we try a sip, and would become slaves to the black and red labels. we linger for a wife, a child, a decent job, an ideology, an idea or a thought, and soon become attached to it. attachment makes freedom relative, and we can not live without it, so the big dream stays a dream for :  "This quest for freedom  enslaves us all..."  me likes you interestingly thought provoking poems, mr. mek. t.y.|`|F2ICQKmBaa	i love ur choice of words.|`|cwrQYmdPaa	I didn't think anyone woke up cheery in the morning anymore, but I think I just have after reading that.

PtoieF7Caa	Then I don't think you would want it anymore. To want something means you have a desire for it in some form, if the desire was taken away then so would the interest in having said item.  Would you still keep it if you had no interest in it?  The whole situation becomes null and pointless.    Edit: What i'm saying is that desire is just an emotion, if there is no emotion then there is no attachment, if there is no attachment then there is no interest. So if a person obtained what they want by detaching themselves from their emotion then the whole outcome would be pointless. Yes letting go of desires can be cleansing and releasing for a person but having them makes a person more driven in life, it gives them purpose if only for a short while, the outcome is merely the reward at the end (good or bad)  There is a book called "You Can Have What You Want" and a quotation from it says "Imagine  what you want is like a beautiful butterfly in your hands. If you squeeze too  tightly the butterfly will be crushed, if you hold your hands too loosely,  the butterfly will simply fly away. The secret is to hold it gently." I don't believe a person can ever truely let go of all their desire. Desire is what gives a person drive, without drive there is no purpose, without purpose it is very difficult to find self acceptance in your life.|`|B7Vy3XJtaa	you are bored , right ?|`|wjCJhxPZaa	And what if I told you "desire" is nothing more than an illusion of the mind?

I'm currently writing a novel involving werewolves, but I read this afterward and was surprised to find how my research and details of werewolves in my story had also been used by Carter, but in a different way.  Carter bases her stories on fairytales (The Brothers Grimm etc.), but does not seek to re-write them, but to bring out the dark and sinister elements already latent in them.  And, in agreement with A pale imitation of The Dame - why have everyone's comments been given the thumbs down? Everyone has answered the question accordingly. We can only write about what we know. Take it or leave it. And, if you haven't read a book, even if it looks bad, how can you give it a thumbs down?

vkzkXWfzaa	A computer and digital camera of course. For software the market leader is Photoshop, which is expensive, but Elements will do most of what you want and will enable you to edit Raw files too. Photoshop CS4 needs a high end computer that has an Open GL graphics card with at least 1M of Ram on it, CS3 is a lot less demanding on computer spec. All photo manipulation packages work best with lots of Ram in your computer at least 2Gb and preferably 4Gb.    Hard drives for image storage can be installed inside a tower computer, but you can always use USB drives. For safety's sake fit two one for backup. Photoshop allows you to import your pictures to two drives simultaneously.    CD and DVD are NOT secure storage a lesson I learnt the hard way! Cards are not secure either for long term storage, they are for just getting the pictures out of your camera onto your computer.    Whatever computer you use I would strongly advise getting your monitor colour calibrated, the monitor is the hub of post processing and if it isn't showing colour correctly then you can't tell if any edit is doing what you want, and is the only way to go to get your prints to match the screen. You can't use an eyeball as the colour detector as it varies, a colourimeter such as a Spyder is needed for accuracy, I know its more expense, but it will save a fortune in ink and paper later.    For printers I would recommend any in the Epson R series, even some of the older models, they are cheaper to run and give superb quality. Some people omit this altogether and go with a commercial print house, but for full control from pressing the shutter to a print in your hand your own printer has serious advantages quality wise, its another learning curve though!    All in all quite a shopping list, but you only have to buy it once, running costs are just the ink and paper for any you print.    Tying all these things together is where the learning curve begins. Getting Camera space, Computer space, Photoshop space and Printer space to all work together takes some time and knowledge as they all use different technologies, at the very least you should get your monitor calibrated as I mentioned before, but its so important its worth mentioning again.

If you want free then you're options are a few 30 day trials and frequent renewals (serious pain in the butt) or various free programs. Like photoshop.com/express or gimp.org  or picasa and countless others.  The free programs are extremely capable programs, and in the right hands put out some serious works.    If you do want to spend around 100 there is Corel's Paint Shop Pro and Adobe's Photoshop Elements.   There are more, but those two often stand out at the 100 range.      Any more than 100 and more options open up with Adobe Photoshop CS being the top of the line, but really unless you plan on pumping out some really high end pieces of photo art, you really don't need the very expensive photoshop.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	Adobe Photoshop.

Robber Barons and the elite maintaining a firm grasp on the control of everything. When war comes along,..it's always the poor who are sent out first. The people protest and revolt.

Besides that... you are asking about a ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEAR PERIOD... and THAT would take several BOOKS to answer because of all the WARS and FAMINE and INDUSTRIALIZATION and EXPLORATION that was going on during those years... Don't you even know THAT MUCH about HISTORY?|`|90zIsbWWaa	Go on Wikipedia, the BBC History website or to the library and get some books|`|BKPx7h3Baa	As you start your period at 1830 it seems safe to say that you're talking about Britain.  The major legislation involved here is 'The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834'.  If you Google that, I'm sure you'll get articles about Poor Relief in England and Wales.  The major difference between the administration of Poor Relief before 1834 and after that year was that, under the provisions of the new Act, the Boards of Guardians (the responsible administrators) were compelled to deal with the matter under the provisions of parliamentary statute. Prior to 1834, the Overseers of the Poor (as the administrators were known then) weren't so compelled because relevant acts of parliament prior to 1834 were 'permissive', which meant that the local administrators could follow its provisions (in whole or in part) if they chose to; they could also ignore it. Legislation at this time was, effectively, guidance. The 1834 Act changed that.
fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	unburried bodies usually mean death by war or by disease. Very rarely they can also mean death by misadventure or from old age (some cultures simply - evict their old people- so they go out to die- Inuits, and vietnamese used to do that)    there actually were several cases when whole bodies were found- one was found in a peat marsh- the guy must have drowned in the marshes (hunter? gatherer? thief hiding from justice?)    Another case was a body found burried in ice in the Alps- SFAIK they found some arrow heads in his body- so seems the guy was wounded and died while escaping. Anybody's guess- he might have been a warrior or a refugee. Or anyone persecuted for any reason.    Also remember Pompei- a cataclysm size volcano eruption and as a result many bodies left without burial. They found one skeleton- young male with a bag of gold. The conclusion was that this was a thief or looter who did not manage to escape in time
ceBTTCPwaa	Kirrin Island is a fictional island in the Famous Five children's books by Enid Blyton. It is based on Corfe Castle on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset. The island first appeared in the first Famous Five novel Five on a Treasure Island and went on to reappear throughout the series.    The Kirrin family used to own all the land around Kirrin however, the family had financial troubles at some point and had to sell off a lot of the land they owned. All that remains of the Kirrin family's land is Kirrin Cottage, Kirrin Farm House and Kirrin Island. The village of Kirrin also still bears the family name although it's not revealed whether the village is still owned by the Kirrin family. At one stage there was a castle on Kirrin Island but eventually Kirrin Castle fell into disrepair and became an old ruin.    Despite the last Famous Five novel, Five Are Together Again, first being printed in 1963, there has been various theories and speculation as to the fate of Kirrin Island. It is presumed that George still owns the island although what state of repair Kirrin Castle is in is open to speculation. It is hoped that the fate of Kirrin Island and castle will be revealed in the announced revival of the Famous Five.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirrin_Isla...|`|pAih5juAaa	Alas no it isn't a real place.

vFF5vwqsaa	Climax is used in an interesting way in Watchers.  Throughout the novel, both Travis and Nora start to develop a more intimate relationship between themselves and the dog, Einstein.  Because of this we start to see an underlying Freudian complex that starts to bulge out from beneath their feet.  As this complex grows, the reader is able to see exactly where the book is heading and where the climax will take us: beneath the sheets.  It is at this point where we see Einstein and Travis reach the climax at the exact same point, while Nora is caught in the middle.  It is Nora's character that creates the climactic tension in the novel where she can either stay or go, but both decisions could change the book entirely.    A Quote:  "Einstein and Travis arrived at their respective climaxes at the same time as it splattered on Nora's face with the vehemence of a Cougar Magnum.  She knew at that point that she made the right decision to stay."    I'm an English Major and I think I'm pretty good at writing about books.  I hope this helps.|`|uoEfoI7aaa	why don't you do your homework yourself, rather than try to find someone to do it for you!    quit asking the same question!, this is the 5th time you have asked the exact same question...obviously nobody wants to do your homework for you!

ugiUyhOwaa	If you want something, then go ahead and make your way towards it! Maybe you can explain to her that you are more interested in photography than drawing. It's your decision and it is your life so you are the one who must decide for yourself, not your teacher. Good luck!|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	I would make up a portfolio of the things I liked to do and was good at. In your case it is photography and making things so collect your best works and put them in a portfolio. Take it to her and tell her you would like her opinion on your work ( this will impress her ). Tell her you are interested in doing art and you would like to know if she thinks you would be able to cope with it. All you can do is ask. Unfortunately there is more to art in class than just doing what you like doing. You will also have to learn the history of art and do a lot of papers on that and also on other artists and even the different genres of art such as Cubism and Impressionism etc. You have to learn all of that when you are studying art even if you only want to learn photography. So keep that in mind when you say you want to do art as a subject. That might also be the reason your teacher doesn't think you would be able to cope with the work. Talk to her and ask her.|`|588a8aa56a591fed908f275a4037cc81aa	explain to her! give her your example of work  you should have it, give her a tons of your good work!  it's a shame that you didn't try your best in the first place, you should at leat try

Humans have an instinctive survival mechanism. They don't want to die so they will usually try most anything to avoid it. Yes, death is inevitable but most people would prefer to avoid it until it is absolutely necessary.  It's also the common fear of the unknown. People don't like to take risks and chances which have no certain outcome, it scares them.  Say there is an afterlife, it could be good or bad, people are afraid of what awaits them.  If there is no afterlife then people fear the darkness that comes with not existing. It is a scary thought that one loses their sense of self and the body stops working. I think most people are afraid of dying, not actually death itself.    If you know death is coming, no matter what you do then you tend to accept it. But if there is any hope of a way out, people will usually go with their instinct and fight for survival.|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	There is nothing bad about it, except the fact that we would die. It's a natural part of life. I think the earth has died and been reborn about 5 times since its creation. So who is to say it won't happen again? Just like you said, we all have to die at some point. I love life, but just like you, I accept death.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Your question reveals the problem. Humanity regards itself as the world.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	I'm not sure we understand what that means really?  If you mean the end to man then yes that is the end for him.  But not for the world.  Because even if all living things die on this earth the world would still go on.  Oddly enough it would still go through the process creating an environment for living things to grow and have existence.  I suppose that would be the pity of it.  We have a planet here that can sustain life yet there is no life here for the earth to sustain.     Of course that would be untrue.  For we know that planets and insects with less intelligence than man would survive and grow somehow.  As in the movie Jurassic Park "life finds a way".    The real answer as to why we should care is this.    We care because man is intelligent enough to care not only about his life but the other lifeforms that exist here.   We care because each one can reproduce in it's own way.  We care because we are a connection from the past to our present.  And our present is a connection to our unborn future that will inherit the world we are responsible with today.  For tomorrow it will be their day just as in the past, it was there time.|`|tIEpxNYpaa	you are retarted for asking that question now you got to delete that yahoo ansers account and dont get a new one|`|jIB2kIzKaa	Correct.....Next Question!|`|xSh9TMS5aa	People fear death, simple as...|`|IDSHUio4aa	Nothing.

Our human nature protects us against killing ourselves through the mechanism of self deception.  We deceive ourselves into "feeling" as if our lives have purpose and meaning.  Even the great atheist, Richard Dawkins, slipped up at the end of an interview and made the statement that he didn't think "we were put on earth to be comfortable".  Which means that deep down inside, he sees himself as fulfilling a grand plan or design that excludes acting on mere comfort.    Honest atheism always leads to nihilism which leads to suicide or mental illness.    Those who accept that God might exist don't have that problem.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...nothing...  ...im content, happy and enjoying my life...  ...death is for everyone, even this world one day...
eezP5wQ2aa	...yes...  ...its their actions i want to see and be aware off...  ...dividends only shows you what you want to see and blind to other things...|`|PtoieF7Caa	I disagree. Humans have always had the capacity to learn and to grow. If people saw only what they have seen or experienced before then humanity wouldn't be where it is today. It's natural curiosity of the unknown and the desire to learn about the world they live in that has allowed people to adapt to modern life.  I believe that humans acknowledge more than they realize about the world around them, whether or not they remember said knowledge or dismiss it as unimportant is another matter, it's still their in the back of their mind. But I think the mind is like a computer, it can only hold so much data before it over-loads so old data or data that is unimportant to everyday life is discarded until it is rediscovered at a later and more relative time.    We're not blind as such, but we tend to focus more on the matters that effect us personally from day to day so learning something that is not related to our lives or ex hists outside of our "personal bubble"  tends to take longer to sink in.|`|hpzfccwaaa	No i do not. If that were so there would not be reports posted as noteworthy.|`|cEa8TTenaa	We can only see what we are conditioned to see - wanting is another issue. Volition is a difficult thing to analyse, but conditioning is different.    We are conditioned by our environment - our environment is everything in our surroundings, including the people who influenced us most as children, our education, our experiences, the places we grew up and visited, what we read, what we watched, and so forth. It is very difficult to break out of conditioning, and we can only see things in the way our conditioning allows us to see them.    Hope this helps|`|B7Vy3XJtaa	Yes, yes , yes   prejudice is a thick glass on some people's eyes|`|qehPqG17aa	Yes I think many people live in denial because they just do not want to deal with the pain the hurt and the reality of another person or even a situation that is causing them grief and stress!

NYU37jfGaa	In the Macmillan Dictionary of women's Biography, it says:    'After Charles's unexpected death in 1740, the 23-year-old Maria Theresa immediately assumed control.  Her initial impetuosity and love of frivolity gave way to a stern, autocratic and rather puritanical style.  She ensured that her husband Francis was crowned Emperor in 1745 and instituted severe taxes and levies to pay for an army to defend her right to the throne, which was challenged by Frederick the Great of Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession.  To do so she limited the power of the nobles, enlarged the central administration, reformed the treasury, implemented sweeping changes in the civil service and the universities, and, despite her piety, brought the Church more strictly under state control.    After Francis's death in 1765, Maria Theresa engaged in a new round of social reforms, less immediately geared to efficient fund-raising and administration, reforming the law and harsh penal policy, developing a poor law system and introducing compulsory primarly education.  Her policy of centralization also encouraged the architectural, social and cultural development of Vienna as a great European capital.  Her relations with her many children were often strained, especially with her son Joseph, co-ruler since Francis's death, only under presssure from him did she agree to the partition of Poland with Russian and Prussia in 1772.  For much of this later period she was il, very fat and very weak, but she remained able and powerful until she died, a far-seeing ruler who had achieved a remarkable unification between the diverse areas of her Austro-Hungarian Empire.

He kissed me, I fainted.  Suddenly, he looked furious, he was trembling with rage, but then he smiled and looked beautiful again.

I tried to figure him out, but I didn't get the chance because he was running his nose along my jawline, then I died."|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, I personally thought Twilight was the best of the series, so I don't know whether you will find any of the others more enjoyable.  The third one, Eclipse, was the most boring in my opinion.    I agree that there is a limit to how many times you want to hear how good-looking Edward is, or how he glides when he walks etc.  But i am afraid you won't hear it any less often in the subsequent books.  I thought the introduction of a secondary love interest in the second book might make it a bit more interesting, but unfortunately Bella continues to drool over Edward just as much.|`|If2ww2i9aa	Yeah it gets better and new moon has the best ending ever!

Just keep on reading. =)|`|CUMnu0OXaa	Okay, eve though I am speaking as the biggest Twilight fan I totally understand what you are saying.    She continually uses the same words and also describes a lot but I like it like that. I think it is down to personal preference. I do wish there wasn't so many of the same word though.    I think it does get a bit better and I know she isn't the best writer in the world like I have heard about one million times from so many twi-haters but she is a good writer, and she isn't bad.    I mean, could you come up with a plot like that. Her work is brilliant and I love that she shared it with everyone else.    Keep reading it, because it doesn get better.|`|CsZVPfwdaa	I think that Twilight was good then New Moon was bad and it gets better from then on!|`|i9QFC9apaa	In twilight most of the action is towards the end of the books in the begging bella is still getting over Edward's good looks so they are mentioned allot|`|cTYAYrb9aa	I loved the first book.    But I hate to burst your (slightly deflating bubble) mate but Twilight really goes downhill from the first book.    I mean, come on! This is the woman who declares a TRIOlogy and Makes an extra to class it as a saga. T_T|`|Z19gRYZwaa	It gets somewhat better, eventually. In New Moon and Eclipse, if anything it gets worse. Breaking Dawn is somewhat better, though still overly unimaginatively sappy. Mostly I just skipped over those bits and only really paid attention when there was some actual plot going on.|`|5Wa8pNn9aa	Twilight gets better at the end most of the action is at the end but the rest of the series is not so good|`|XZfdLVu5aa	I get what you mean it is all about her facination with Edward but the other books get into the the other characters, easpecially New Moon and Eclipse. Much better with Jacob Black as a main character :D    p.s we get to see that Edward ain't all good, kerching!|`|bkz5hs4Paa	I know how you feel. At first I loved hearing about how gorgeous he was, but after a while I wanted something to happen, and eventually it did. The second book is my favorite and I think that's when it really picks up, but the end of the first is very good. She does improve in her writing, its not ALL about Edward after the first book, and she starts to develop the other characters more. After the first book Bella gets over how hot he is and starts to see his faults, and thats when it really gets good! I suggest you continue reading, it gets much better!    ps. Robert Pattinson is HOT! (actor playing Edward). Looking him up!|`|FSGuFG8gaa	It really doesn't get any better than that, I also tried reading it and those books were terrible. Don't continue reading it but if you like the storyline you should try reading Interview with a Vampire by Anne Rice. SMeyer basically took her storyline from Rice, but Rice is a way better author :)|`|YlRMabZ4aa	Honestly it depends on you. Personally I liked Twilight, not for the mushy stuff and all, though. Towards the end their is some action, which I liked. New Moon, to me at least has a bit less of what your talking about, cause there is not much of Edward until the end, but a lot of Bella missing Edward. As for Eclipse, has more of that mushy stuff, and same goes for Breaking Dawn, I could not stand somethings in Breaking Dawn, still liked it, but I was begining to get annoyed with the same stuff you are annoyed with, but thats just how I am, I am not much of a fan of romance novels, but when I start a series I do like to finnish them, and Twilight was a fun read for me, just not my favorite. Also I agree with you about Robert Pattison, I thought I was alone.|`|r68xD4JFaa	No, it's a horrible book suitable for feeble minded idiots.  the types that will post hundreds of useless questions here, all marked spoilers, as if people are to stupid to avoid questions regarding the book they're reading if they want surprises.      Don't finish reading it, then as I'm encouraging all people to do, report every empty headed question written by these people to drive them out of the answers section.  They've already ruined it, by reporting anyone who dares give an honest opinion of their favorite book, which is thinly veiled Buffy fan fiction.    The same goes for the dimwits who "roleplay" harry potter characters in here.|`|bhs05edAaa	If you want to read a good vampire book try Anne Rices "Interview with a Vampire", which is deeper, better written and just plain more interesting than Twilight.|`|FHrrKxO5aa	I understand what you are saying but if you can get past all the "gorgeousness"  the books are good. Also the only reason ppl keep saying new moon was boring is because Edward wasn't in most of it. I enjoyed all four books Eclipse was my favorite.  Give it some time and try to ignore how "perfect" Edward is supposed to be.|`|kC8i88d2aa	yes|`|kUE3Ddktaa	No, it's repetitive all the way through. There are about 10 pages of action near the end, and then the next three books are even more repetitive than the first one. If anything, the books get worse - both in the quality of writing and the slowness of the plot - after "Twilight."    Eclipse, for example: Bella hangs out with Edward. Bella hangs out with Jacob. Repeat times 20. Conflict that lasts about ten minutes. The End.|`|cxip3nA8aa	That's one thing (well, one of the millions of things) that bug the heck out of me about Twilight. Stephenie Meyer can't write description. The stuff about Edward at first was great! Yes, he's hot but by page 300, I think we've established that concept. It turns into crap after a while and makes me wonder if Meyer hasn't ever written before in her life.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Not really. It's the same, and even a bit worse later on. If you really want to know what happens, without having to endure the bad writing, look up the summary on wikipedia.

810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	I do stop sometimes, rarely, if the book is that bad.     Most of the time, though, I'll go back to it and give it another try, then I usually finish it.     I get kind of weird about not finishing books..|`|aeODdMATaa	I wouldn't read it, I'll put it down and maybe start where I left off at another time after reading something thats good.|`|Aij8qBYpaa	I just stop reading it because I would rather be reading something I enjoy rather than finishing a book I don't.|`|KHUEkyNaaa	No, i HAVE to actually like a book in order to finish it!|`|A65C8cmeaa	If I start it then I have to finish it no matter how bad it is I pull through.|`|AA10187097	I have a varied taste in books so can read just about any fiction without  getting bored.

I've tried to pick up another book and read it because I didn't like the original one but it drove me crazy ... I had to know if there was something I was going to miss.  I still ended up being disappointed in the book but I did finish it!|`|b7a146ef697ee51a64d659330e1ba1ebaa	I'll usually finish the book no matter how bad it maybe, that way I'm able to have a complete opinion of the book.|`|QMbaeva9aa	If the book has a good reputation, I try to stick with it to see what the fuss is about, but eventually I'll give up.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	I've taken two books back to the library unread.

But normally if i don't like a book then, a few months later i will pick it up again and probably like it :) hope i helped!|`|fUIYoeRfaa	I DEFINATLEY DEFINATELY need to get a new book! im a book lover but i mean if the book is boring drop it and pick up a new one!|`|ozIz7Ojlaa	I can never stop reading a book even if I don't like it.

I stop because there are so many other books that are worthy of my time so I'd rather be reading something that entertains me rather than bores me.|`|8sxD1qUBaa	I normally try and finish the book no matter how much i am not enjoying it because it might get better as it progresses, if it  doesn't il still try and finish it but if it is REALLY awful then i wont read it i have only ever done that once before though :)|`|AA11199739	Usually if I paid for the book, I feel I have to get my money's worth and finish it. Also, I always live in hope that the book will get better.    This may sound crazy, but I was reading The Red and The Black by Stendhal and I heartily disliked it. However, when I got near the end, when the main character almost murders his previous lover, I became fascinated with his behavior and his thinking. It just changed how I felt about the book and I had to reread it. On the second reading, I realized that it really is a very good book. What I find so interesting is that it was almost like a miracle or a great surprise (yes, I was taken by surprise) to find myself so drawn to this character when he makes his momentous decision.|`|WUcjQFx4aa	No, i stop because something else comes up and i can never be bothered to get back to reading it|`|ugiUyhOwaa	I always finish reading what I have started because I cannot bear to just sit there and wonder what happened in the end of the story. Even though the plot of the story bores me, I still finish it for the sake of freedom from wondering.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Not any more.  I used to be like that when I was young, but now I am getting pretty old I feel that there isn't enough time to read books I actually enjoy, let alone wasting time reading books I don't enjoy.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Usually, unless I really can't finish the book. Twilight I could finish because the writing was addicting and it had a shred of entertainment value. I've tried reading Brave New World, and I couldn't get past twenty pages. It just didn't hook me. Picture of Dorian Gray and Steinbeck's books I had an awful time getting through, but I had to finish them for school. If I hadn't had school, then I would have stopped reading them after the first few pages. Finding a book that I can't finish isn't all that common, though. Those three books I mentioned - the one I stopped reading, and the two for school - are the only ones I wanted to stop reading in many years.
LSXosyX3aa	Georges-Pierre Seurat|`|tLpppqJuaa	George Seurat. (Funnily enough, I know this from the *musical* about the painting, Sunday In The Park With George.) Thought it might be spelt 'Georges' as another has suggested, being French.|`|3M3UtNyvaa	Georges Seurat
iGfNQoX3aa	This is difficult because anyone who is a rabid fan of a style of music is likely to think their music is NOT obscure.  Plus, there are so many artists out there trying to make a mark as something unique, new styles are created practically every day.    However, I think if I would to stick with established styles of music, styles that have recognized artists and somewhat of a following (which by that definition would mean they weren't really obscure) - I would have to say music of the New Complexity.      Brian Ferneyhough, as an extension of serialism, started to experiement in the 1980's with thinking about all the various sounds an instrument could make and not just the ones typically found in standard notation.  The result was an explosion of new ways of notating music to incorporate all the detail necessary to instruct the performer how to play any given note.  Often these instructions are too intense to successfully be performed live and so the intensity which performers approach these pieces is on the extreme level.      While there are a number of composers who fall into the category of New Complexity, they are primarily British and the music has not really taken hold in the classical music world (or any other for that matter).  Those that love it really love it.      What results in this form of music is a new way at looking at what an instrument (and instrumentalist) can do, what constitutes sound, and what changes in notation need to come about in order to really express what composers what in terms of note production.      I am not really a fan - I wouldn't sit a listen to this music to relax, but then again, that's not the point.  The point is intensity, complexity and not relaxation.  However, I am very interested in the concepts and possibilities of the music.  It has certainly affected my own compositions in how I approach getting what I want played written on the page.|`|LoKJBLF1aa	avant-garde, free-form jazz.awful.lets make sure it stays obscure heh heh
iGfNQoX3aa	Certainly musicals come from opera.  In the time of Mozart opera buffa (or comic opera) was considered light entertainment.  This eventually lead to the operetta's of Gilbert & Sullivan, late 19th 20th century.      These light operatic forms of entertainment would give way to Vaudeville and folly style entertainments (song and dance shows).  However, the idea of a show that followed a single story line was still appealing and in the late 1920's the film Jazz Singer (the first talkie) led the way to shows that combined speaking dialog interspersed with songs - the musical was born.    In the late 20th century, Sondheim brought the musical full circle with pieces like "Sweeney Todd" which might be classified as opera, as they are fully sung.  And yet, many modern operas have spoken dialog.  So, the line between the two is blurring more and more.   Is "Evita", which is entirely sung an opera?  Is "Leave Me Alone!" which has large amounts of spoken dialog a musical?  Does an opera have to be classical music (and if so, what is classical music)?|`|YN8CwnRfaa	Some musicals are based off of operas, like Rent, which is based on Puccini's La Boheme. Most musicals (and operas as well) are based on books, such as Les Miserables, which is adapted from Victor Hugo's book.
1EzSAU5Haa	Wrong question, because the war wouldn't have started if the US hadn't triggered Iraq to invade Iran.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Yes.  Without US aid, the Iraqis would have gotten overrun.  Thanks to an 'endless' supply of US-made 155 MM artillery, the Iraqis were able to hold off the Iranians.  During this time,  Vice-president George .H.W. Bush went to Iraq and was photographed and filmed embracing Saddam Hussein, holding hands with him, walking together arm-in-arm and waving to the cameras.    Try finding those photos now.  They've all been destroyed, apparently, but those of us who are old enough (50s +) remember when Saddam and the US were tight, with the US on top.|`|c8c1cb28e44d345f313a31fd56774537aa	Iraq havent lost the war with iran, USA provided them of all technology to won the war, and now the US want to take Iraq bec the OIL! but I dont think they will won Iraq|`|5wufIH1Haa	You really shouldn't try to worry about the "what ifs" in history. Especially considering the Middle East, that history is so long and interwoven that you could confuse facts with the what ifs. That would be like saying what if one of the plots to kill Hitler actually worked, would 6 million Jews have died? or 4 million handicapped? It's all speculation.|`|wWWq9myCaa	Iraq lost the war to iran. Look at history saddam was looking to invade iran in the 80's and he failed, even with the help of US and Europe. Iraq would have been a lot hard to invade for the U.S. had it won that war because it would have had more oil than Saudi Arabia. That would have really helped its economy it might have even been richer than the US had it won. Iraq lost the war never trust a source that said it won.

Why not just print it out from a computer?  Publishing a book costs a lot of money, and no reputable publisher will do this for you.  They won't put the time and effort into getting you a book cover or editing and typesetting your pages.  What's in it for them?    Vanity publishers let you self publish a book, but like I said, it's expensive.  It'd be much cheaper for you to print it out and put it in a binder.  You could draw your own cover art that way.
w7USF5wDaa	If you want to go for the one with the most information then I would skip Penguin and Oxford's World Classics and go with a Norton Critical Edition.  The Nortons always have annotations and an extensive bibliography as well as essays that provide background information and critical analysis of the works and are printed on a better quality paper.  They cost a little bit more but they're the best as far as I'm concerned  http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/...    http://www.amazon.com/Northanger-Abbey-N...  http://www.amazon.com/Persuasion-Norton-...  http://www.amazon.com/Jane-Eyre-Norton-C...  http://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-...

l74RoxUDaa	There is this old Buddhist torture which goes thus:  get yourself into the most comfortable position possible.  Spare no expense and make yourself really comfortable and happy.  Now stay there fixed in this position.  After a few minutes, you might start to get restless.  After an hour, it ceases to be very pleasant.  After a day you are in considerable pain.  After a week you are crippled, and after a month you are dead.  Even trees that are rooted in the ground sway in the wind and welcome the endless movement of animals.    The world will end as we know it today tomorrow morning.  It is quite impossible to hold onto everything to eternity precisely as we knew it today.    For example, the world I know today is half-covered with thawing snow.  It might last the night, but if the sun comes out tomorrow, it will soon turn to slush and the ground to mud.  The snowman we lovingly made in our image will droop and melt and his eyes will fall to the ground.    Some of these changes are seasonal.  Some are subtle, like the growing trees and the natural decay of all man-made objects.  Some are profound - we may not know the gentle climate and the vast wealth of companion life in 30 years time or so.  Some are in our perception - as we get older we forget recent memories and close our eyes to the present as the world we relate with is the one that really existed a long time ago.    Above all, we all adapt or succumb, and in the end we all die.|`|AA11635601	"as we know it" is a dramatic phrase most people add for the drama but dont' really consider what it means.

Y4RS35M7aa	Do you mean the countries that were colonized?      Don't forget that Colon (Columbus) sailed for the Spanish crown, and claimed everything he saw for Spain.    Spain conquered much of the New World, or at least claimed it as being conquered, and Los Conquistadores did ride all over much of what we call North, Central, and South America, so most of those continents, save Brazil, were considered Spanish Colonies.  Also, parts of the Pacific Basin, including the Philippine Islands, the Marianas Islands,  and other atolls were Spanish, or claimed by them.    In the Caribbean, too, most of the Islands were, at one time, claimed for Spain.  Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and other island chains were all claimed by Spain.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	Think of it like this:  What countries other than Spain speak Spanish now?

Keira would be multi-faceted if, say, she is a strange, passionate, alluring, energetic character that also has a dark streak.  But it's important not to base a character entirely on one person - but to write your character as a certain type that people will be able to identify with and say, "I know a person like that." e.g. their character traits are universally recognisable without being cliched.

xJoMSkI5aa	Sonnet 18 opens up looking an awful lot like a traditional love poem, but by the end its pretty clear that the poet is much more into himself and the poetry he produces than the beloved hes addressing. In fact, at times it seems like he might actually harbor some resentment toward the beloved.    Full analysis at Shmoop Poetry
kUE3Ddktaa	The main theme is that the object of the speaker's affection (his beloved) will live forever in the poem he's written about her. The idea is that, even though the beloved will eventually die, her beauty and goodness will live on and be remembered whenever people read Sonnet 18.    Death won't be able to brag about taking the beloved because she will achieve a kind of immortality through art.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Shakespeare's Sonnets    Themes:    Love  Literature and Writing  Time  Man and the Natural World    Full Theme Summaries:  http://www.shmoop.com/themes/poetry/will...|`|MBiAm9zaaa	Its a love poem.

uPVnqbE8aa	If what you mean by "work lights" are those used by home auto repairs or painters, etc, then, yes you can use them.  They are relatively cheap and come on stands or can sit on the floor, etc.  In controlling light intensity it is far easier to reduce the intensity than increase it.  So, with that in mind, I prefer the highest wattage I can get.  When I use lights like that I buy 1,000W bulbs.  The kinds shaped like long thin tubes.  You may have to buy ones this powerful off the internet but it is very worth it.  Reducing light is easy with scrims, diffusion,  or backing off the light itself.  These lights will get very hot so be careful and use good leather garden gloves to handle them.  If that is too much of a hassle for you then  you can get 500W ones at any good hardware store.    Since these are Tungsten bulbs make sure your white balance is set on automatic when using your digital camera, and do not mix incandescent or fluorescent bulbs unless you want some kind of lighting effect.  One thing to keep in mind is that these lights cast very hard shadows, and when shooting portraits use heavy diffusion in front of these lights on stands or arms about 1' away, or the heat will melt them.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	I use 250W to 500W.

But you should be able to do that.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	The Bolshevik takeover of Russia. You will find plenty of material. One that comes to mind is John Reed's Ten Days That Shook the World. It is the seminal journalistic work on the Revolution. Now this could take you to Stanlinism instead, or the causes or a cause that led to WWI. Either of those topics ought to have plenty of material for a small term paper.    You could write a paper on Bismarck or Prussian nationalism which led to the formation of Germany. The Prussian-Franco War led in some ways to WWI. You can sort this out pretty easily by looking up a book on Otto Von Bismarck.    Write about the formation of the Italian states by the great leader Garibaldi.     A very interesting subject is Lawrence of Arabia and the desert revolt against the Turks which aided the British in their fight against Germany during WWI. Lawrence would make a good topic since it doesn't cover everything about the war. Lawrence of Arabia, the movie, would make a good start to introduce characters to you. T E Lawrence wrote a book called The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. You could certainly get info from this book but I am trying to read it now and am finding it incredibly difficult going.    What about the popular notion at the time that WWI would be the "war to end all wars." Why did people think this? Why were they so wrong?     There is President Wilson who was desperate to start the League of Nations. Your paper could be about his failure at the hands of British and French politicians who were too savvy for him. There is a little known fact that he suffered a stroke during his last days as President, and his wife and doctor kept it from everybody so he could continue as President.    You could write one on Henry VIII's wives, his desperation for a son to take the throne. Elizabeth I's rise to power, her struggle with Mary, Queen of Scots. A very interesting and little known character is Sir Francis Walsingham, who was Elizabeth's intelligence officer. You can start your search about Elizabeth and Walsingham from the movie Elizabeth which came out in 1997 with Cate Blanchet and Geoffrey Rush, only as a start. It is also highly fictitious.    Hope this helps. There is a wealth of information in books on European history. Just remember to limit yourself to a smallish topic that can be covered by 5 pages.    It would be good to have a college library near by.

Y4RS35M7aa	Well, Sunshine, in the US there were no parties in the beginning.  General, then President Washington wanted no arguments in his administration, and so he "discouraged" their formation.  So the men of good will who had differing opinions drifted into what would be called "factions."      One faction favored a strong central government and close ties with Great Britain, whom we had just fought in a war.  They represented the Northern states who had manufacturing economies.  The other faction wanted strong states with a weak central government and close ties to France.  They were representing Southern states with farm economies.  Of course, some Southerners favored the strong government, and some Northeners did not, but generally, those were the factions.    The former, in many ways, became the Republicans, and the other became the Democrats.  They were not called that, though.  Once Washington left office, the factions broke off into separate parties, calling themselves Federalists (led by Hamilton) and Democrat-Republicans (led by Jefferson).|`|9XJLlPaEaa	Ideas on what...how the federalist and anti-federalist started is fact not idea, same with republicans, democrats, anti-masons, whigs, etc..

AA12016117	Well, he didn't cut them off personally!    They were also displayed on old London Bridge.  A famous head spiked there was that of Sir Thomas More:    "The head, after being parboiled, was exposed on London Bridge for a month when Margaret Roper bribed the man, whose business it was to throw it into the river, to give it to her instead. The final fate of the relic is somewhat uncertain, but in 1824 a leaden box was found in the Roper vault at St. Dunstan's, Canterbury, which on being opened was found to contain a head presumed to be More's."  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14689c.h...

AA10725882	Ho Chi Minh himself fought against the occupying Japanese.  He was helped by American medical personnel.  Ho was shocked when Americans aided the French in taking back Vietnam as a colony after the war.  That has to be one of America's greatest mistakes.    From Wiki (edited)  "In 1941, H? led the Vi?t Minh independence movement and fought against the Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II.  He was supported by the United States Office of Strategic Services - which later became the CIA.  In 1943 Ho was treated for malaria and dysentery by American OSS doctors.  After the August Revolution of 1945, H? became Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that borrowed much from the American declaration of independence.  His government was not recognized by the Allies.   He repeatedly petitioned American President Harry Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, but Truman never responded."|`|4FWrRRF2aa	In WW1 the Vietnamese fought as "French" Colonial Troops, some served on the western Front.

I don't know enough to comment on the form, but I will be searching out rondeaux, promise!|`|raU9c3tzaa	well chosen refrain.  perfect meter, me still have to do with the internal beat, because, matching syllables count doesn't always mean steady internal beat. for example: in the line : "Closing within, uttering sighs." requires readers' effort to figure the phonetic pattern that would make the proper beat flow .   In this type of subjects, the singular form of body parts would suffice for the plural [ ex:, eye>eyes, ear>ears, hand> hand], and the part would suffice for the whole mass [ finger > hand, hand> body]. so, if you want to keep "strict" rhyme, taking the "s" out of "eyes" would do it.  flow of images :  * powerful first stanza.  * beautiful second stanza.  * Nice third stanza..nice flow of image, in general. you could have used more powerful language [wording] for a better flow for the first four lines. the last two lines flowed nicely, and made a sensational ending.

pd4VLvoHaa	It is difficult to judge as a 'story' because it is only one small scene, so concentrating only on the style: As 'conrad x' states, it's a little 'jumpy' but I think you can fix that with sentence structure. For instance, you commence with the stress of the character then describe the weather in a subsequent sentence. Think about ways to combine those two sentences into one. Don't describe conditions just because you think they add effect, connect the conditions to the action and advancement of the story.    Don't be afraid to stretch out the action. You do a pretty good job of establishing mood and tension with transition to action, but it feels a little rushed, all of it. Don't overdo it but don't be afraid to elaborate.    Technical nitpicking (1): the opening sentence, "He gripped the back of his neck..." The back of whose neck? His own neck or someone else's neck? Be careful not to pile too many pronouns into a sentence without clearly stating who is who and who is doing what to who.    Technical nitpicking (2): Passive verb... "A pistol was fired..." Pistols don't fire themselves, somebody fires them. When the others in the room crowd around and strike the character, the passive element of that verb action supports a sense that he does not know who is striking him and from his perspective, it appears as some number of disembodied limbs, so in that case, style and effect arguably justify the technical violation. Just be conscious of passive verb use and if you choose to do it, know why you are doing it.    Overall, I think it's pretty good and I encourage you to push ahead.    http://www.nokilleye.com/111000.htm|`|q3Fbkztbaa	wow...thats amazing  keep it up|`|b97IpZBOaa	PROBLEMS,,,,PROBLEMS..|`|cUgtkGdVaa	sure :]|`|m3rt9x8Caa	sorry just giving you advice, maybe it would be better to put this on www.storywrite.com you can write stories on there and get comments on them also view other peoples and comment on theres|`|cxip3nA8aa	It's great!!

TKl8Ljrvaa	I think, if it boils down to it, your question can be answered by a few of Sir Winston Churchill's quotes ( the British world war 2 preme minister) he said,  People say that Maxists and Fascists are worlds apart, but what is the difference between north and south pole? maybe a few polar bears here and a few polar bears there but all around the same dead desolate landscape.  the other quote was,  what matter is not what you say, because we as humans do not say anything that has never been said, the only original things in us is the original sin, but how you say it makes the difference.  the difference is that this guy had a gift, a gift of the garb and he could say someting in such a way that everyone could adore him but when it boils deep down, he did not say anything new.  Do I admire him? alot|`|WVXVeN8Gaa	He's so adored because people believe he formulated the foundations for creating a utopian society.    He's a pompous figure of antiquity, and the only people that make him out to be great are historians and those that consider themselves "enlightened".

To make it poetry, take what you have written, and make the effort to let the words flow line by line, and find words that express what you have expressed, but in rhyme wherever possible.  You know the old rhyme:    Roses are red,   Violets are blue  Sugar is sweet  And so are you    That simple one liner contains all the elements of poetry.  Lines, rhyme, message.      I hope you don't mind the criticism, but it is meant to be constructive.  You have something, but it is as yet raw, and needs to be channeled.  Good luck, keep writing, and remember, things will get better, when you grow out of your teenage angst!|`|8480359be8375ad8bd76aba19d816effaa	Hey really nice and touchy one...

In late 2001 the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). This force is composed of NATO troops that are involved in assisting the government of President Hamid Karzai in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key infrastructures in the nation. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion US dollars have also been provided by the international community for the reconstruction of the country."    THE 1979 SOVIET WAR IN AFGHANISTAN  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_...  "...a nine-year conflict involving Soviet Union forces supporting the Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) government against the Islamist mujahideen resistance. The latter group found support from a variety of sources including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations in the context of the Cold War. This conflict was concurrent to the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the IranIraq War."    THE 2001 U.S.-LED WAR IN AFGHANISTAN  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afgh...  "...which began on October 7, 2001 as the U.S. military operation Operation Enduring Freedom, was launched by the United States with the United Kingdom in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks."

THE PERIOD OF WARLORDISM: 1992-1996  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan...  "The USSR continued to support President Najibullah (former head of the Afghan secret service, KHAD) until 1992 when the new Russian government refused to sell oil products to the Najibullah regime."    "Because of the fighting, a number of elites and intellectuals fled to take refuge abroad. This led to a leadership imbalance in Afghanistan. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, which gave rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. It was at this time that the Taliban developed as a politico-religious force, eventually seizing Kabul in 1996 and establishing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."

COLD WAR: THE U.S. IN 1979  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan...  "As part of a Cold War strategy, in 1979 the United States government (under President Jimmy Carter) began to covertly fund forces ranged against the pro-Soviet government, although warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention, (according to National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski)."

I mean God wouldn't say I love your soul but not your DNA, God is infinite you know like God doesn't have a mind, it just loves EVERYTHING.    You are on this earth because you have things to learn, in this body. Don't fight it, don't fight anything. Just go with the flow...|`|az2ZBy3iaa	Ha, YOU're the clown. Swallowing religious propaganda like that...can you truly believe the existence of a soul when you can't even prove its existence?

The real problem, though is that the gangsters have made so much money in these last hundred years of material pursuits, that they are able to bend minds to their greed wherever they choose. There is only one force able to lift people's greatness out of the materialistic miasma and that is the teaching propagated by the SGI.org. If you care enough to ask the question, care enough to read and use the LDK.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	People are becoming more materialistic because of this hedonistic twenty-first civilization. It is a cycle. They indulge in pleasures and at the end of the day, some of them start to question the "meaning of life" (a phrase which I am getting sick of) most probably due to emptiness or a relationship meltdown. However, even hitting this point of existentialism, majority do not bother to find out why there is even a universe at the first place. Hedonists simply return back to their pleasures like hanging out in shopping malls, walking blindly in the crowd, hanging out with friends and so on. Moreover, since technology is advanced today, hedonists who had hit the point of existentialism would run/turn to music, for an example, to temporary relief the "darkness" they are facing. It is simply an illusion which would be shattered when they hit existentialism again. People are so blind, they can't realize what they are doing.     I am 16 years old but believe me, I am completely different from the typical teenagers. I am not materialistic and I detest going out, having to face a hedonistic humanity. I even hate 'fashion'. To me, fashion or style is just another act of "****-ty-ness". Look around you, girls wearing short skirts, short pants and tight tops. How are they different from prostitutes? They want men to notice them and when they have received the attention, some start feeling uneasy. Utterly rubbish.     If you were someone who hates materialism and how the world is today in terms of hedonism, not suffering, then I suggest that you read the book titled "Into The Wild". There is a movie you may watch it on: www.watch-movies.net It is based on a true account. Google it.|`|bwyBXDMHaa	Because we are living in a material world and i am a material girl! :)|`|r18r2bLiaa	Because money is life!|`|DMpVSHvXaa	People are exactly the same as they've always been.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The capitalist system demands it. Here's how it works:    1. The rate of profit that a manufacturer makes always goes down over time.    2. To compensate for the reduced rate of profit, more items must be sold. For example, if you used to make $10 on each item you manufactured and now you make only $1, then you'll have to sell ten times as many items just to keep the same amount of profit that you used to make.    3. This means that you try to sell to other countries and try to maximize your sales by extending easy credit. The last thing you want is a society of thrifty people saving money. You want people to buy.    4. In support of this, you develop an ideology that encourages purchases, often on-the-spot; and also encourages a throw-away attitude so that there will be more purchases.    5. Now you've got a society that goes deeply into debt to make purchases and needs to keep working to pay off that debt; that encourages wasteful spending and an attitude of tossing anything that isn't deemed perfect; that doesn't have the time or the inclination for sparrows or anything else like that. In short, you've got the current state of the nation.

There are also forums for discussion of various topic categories related to photography.  Good places to ask questions.  Critiques can be brutal, perhaps not expressing the same sense of pride that you have in your photograph.  However, the period of time you must participate prior to uploading a photo of your own will also teach you much about composition, correct exposure and focus.

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	The first book is "Nowhere to Call Home" by Cynthia Defelice  http://www.amazon.com/Nowhere-Call-Home-...  "Despite the ongoing Depression, 12-year-old Frances leads a life that's comfortable, orderly, and a little dull--until the night her father puts a bullet in his head. Suddenly she must pack a bag and travel by train to her aunt in Chicago. Instead, Frances, who has heard a little about hoboes riding the trains from one of the servants, cashes in her ticket, buys some boys' clothes, cuts her hair, and sneaks aboard a boxcar. Frances, who now calls herself Frankie, quickly realizes that hoboes live in a completely different society with its own rules, routines, and language. Fortunately, she finds a friend to guide her--Stewpot, a 15-year-old boy. Of course, there are a number of books with a similar theme, including Mary Downing Hahn's The Gentleman, the Outlaw, and Me--Eli (1996), but De Felice's historical novel is so real that every bump of the train can be felt. The smooth, vivid writing makes us experience the unfolding events and the nitty-gritty details right along with the characters, so as Frankie becomes increasingly horrified by the squalor and inhumanity she sees along her journey, we get a powerful sense of history. The ending is at once optimistic and poignant: Frankie will appreciate the comfort and security of her life even as she remembers the grim conditions she witnessed, and readers will feel sure that she will take advantage of her privilege to try to improve things for others."

0LgpcOBDaa	When is it best to watch a sunset?    At sunset...!     Noon is often too bright to see much in the way of colors and mid night is often too dark.    The better days tho are them with clouds, storm clouds too, but a full dull and drizzly day may not offer much. However, there are times the sun can find a opening and give you a show. You just never know.    When exposing for sunsets always under expose your images. If you shoot on Auto of Program you will most likely get bland and washed out colors. If your camera has no Manual mode, maybe you have a way to cut back the exposure in a menu some where. The EV range may be fiddled with to make the exposures darker.    Don't be afraid to get things in your foreground. Trees. Rocks. Lighthouse. Dock or piers. People... If done right they add to the image.    Clouds, clouds and more clouds... Storm clouds too, all add to the beauty of the sunset. You might get lucky to capture lightning, again, you never know. You have a totally cloud free day..? It's still worth a drive because our atmosphere is full of junk, and this 'stuff' can give red glows like distance fires over the horizon that can last long after the sun has set.    If near water, try looking for the "green flash" as the sun just slips under the horizon.    http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...    This is a true and often seen (but it only lasts a second) event. Because it's so brief, many do NOT see it even if 'looking'... This can sometimes be seen at sunrise too, but again, mostly over water or vast expanses of flat open land.    Here are a few of my desert south west sunsets..    http://lensmen2.smugmug.com/gallery/7281...    Enjoy    Bob - Tucson|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	The best sunsets will come after a breezy or windy day, partly cloudy Sky's and when the wind dyes down a little before sunset. This will make for Orange/ Reddish Clouds (because of the dust in the air )and it is Beautiful! If you have a choice,( it sounds like you don`t if it is the Ocean) You should be on the East side. It will make for a Picture Perfect evening. I live on the East side of a lake In northern MN & that's when I find them the Best! Good luck to you on your sunsets!  =)|`|tFVyfvS3aa	Obviously a clear day would be to your advantage in order to view the sunset clearly|`|QLopvWKDaa	The best sunsets are when a weather front is approaching.    So it may have been a clear day, but a front is moving in towards night fall.  Watch the weather in your area to predict the best time- that way you get the clouds that intensify the colours- just beautiful!|`|qXAvXHdYaa	I like clear or partly cloudy days about an hour before the sunset(known in photography as the "golden hour").  Also stick around for about 20-30 minutes after sunset, that is very pretty too.|`|GDJGNYFcaa	You should round up a bunch of friends and go have fun at the beach. Run around and splash and wear yourselves out doing whatever you do. It's the sunsets you catch that you didn't mean to see that will stick with you the longest. Some of the best sunsets I can remember come from driving down 136 in Central Illinois (most dismal and depressing drive I've experienced) and looking in the rear view and seeing the colors come alive while the storm fronts are moving in. Another time I was out cleaning up branches and limbs after a big storm when the clouds broke and the sun put a golden cast on everything. Don't go out with the intention of seeing one, as your expectations may not be met. Go out and live you life, and see and do everything. What's a good sunset if you're impatiently watching for something to happen? As for the pictures, go into the settings on your camera and see if you can adjust ISO. Turn it down as far as it will go and point it >near
c8XHnKV2aa	hi BB  One literary critic calls Wuthering Heights an  "allegory for the corruption of culture by nature."  Check the first entry on this link. Joyce Carol Oates, (third link) a famous author, thinks the book isn't allegory, everything that happens including the incredibly passionate relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine is simply exactly as it is.

DW7J8huQaa	Title your book after you are done writing it.  No one can come up with an appropriate title but you.  And, if you are trying to get this published, a publisher may change the title anyway.    When thinking of a title, there is so much more than the general plot line to consider.  The title could be something about the character, about fear at losing his friend, about boxing, something about the friend's character, about the search for the friend, or about some little detail that you don't give away in the plot but you discover when reading.  This is why a lot of people don't know the title for their stuff right away, but ultimately only you can pick the title.|`|U21h1JDoaa	The underworld of Society in My Eyes|`|KSAbA57Haa	Quest of the Amateur|`|3izRJuxOaa	Boxatator    Box glove gone    set out of the ring    fight to the max|`|WxoZrTPlaa	I'd go with some interesting boxing term like:    Knockdown  Knockout  On the Ropes  Right Hook  Upper Cut|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	The story sounds good.

DIlNnjf8aa	This is from an Australian government website,  so "caveat emptor":    Camp life    Internment camps were administered by the army and run along military lines. During World War I they were often referred to as concentration camps. Camps were established in repurposed institutions such as the old gaols at Berrima and Trial Bay in New South Wales. The largest camp during World War l was at Holsworthy (Liverpool), west of Sydney.    During World War II, internees were first housed in prisons, such as at Long Bay gaol in New South Wales, or impromptu accommodation such as the Northam race course in Western Australia and the Keswick army barracks in Adelaide. The first camps were set up at the Enoggera (Gaythorne) and Liverpool military bases in Queensland and New South Wales and at the Dhurringile Mansion in Victoria.    As the numbers of internees grew, the early camps became too small. The Australian Government then constructed purpose-built camps at Tatura (Rushworth) in Victoria, at Hay and Cowra in New South Wales, at Loveday in South Australia and at Harvey in Western Australia.    Life for the internees varied between the camps, particularly between those that were temporary camps and those that were purpose-built. The conditions also depended on the geographical location of the camp, its climate, the composition of the camp population and importantly, the personality of the officer in charge.  After the wars    At the end of each war the internment camps were closed down. After World War I, most internees were deported. During World War II many internees, particularly Italians, were released before the end of the war. Others were allowed to leave the camps after hostilities ceased. Internees of British or European origin were permitted to remain in Australia after the war, including those who had been brought from overseas by British authorities. Most of those of Japanese origin, however, including some who were Australian-born, were repatriated' to Japan in 1946.
Z19gRYZwaa	I like my stories well built (no plot holes, consistent characters, a setting that holds together,etc.), with exciting bits and funny bits that fit naturally into the story. I generally read sci-fi/fantasy, though I read some other stuff. if there is going to be romance it has to be realistic and mature (whiny teenage angst makes me want to beat the characters with an ice pick), and there has to be a plot as well. I don't mind endings that are somewhat predictable as long as there are a few things that surprise you in the book.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I look for more of the horror genre  I like really good authors   and the cover cannot be boaring  I like a mystery with a blast at the end|`|bkz5hs4Paa	Romance, if there's no romance in a book I usually won't read it. I just love the connection two people can have. Also anything with angst and drama! Nothing really fluffy, but sometimes a bit of fluff can be good.    I don't read any mystery novels, I always know who the killer is going to be and the rest of the book is just boring.|`|ajeMVARraa	I look for a good "voice" from the main character/author. If I can put myself in their shoes, I'm more likely to finish the book. I also like good conflict. Something that you don't really see coming. There's always the main conflict of the story, but if there are good sub-plots going on at the same time, I LOVE it!.   And I hate reading books that have the character switch personalities. Like, it starts off that the MC is kind of outspoken and a no non-sense type, then three chapters later, she's cowering under a lunch table from the school bully. You know? I usually throw books like that away.|`|DW7J8huQaa	I usually read a variety of themes and genres, which brings a variety of settings.  But there are a few elements that every kind of book has in common.  You need characters that the reader can identify with, whether they are sympathizing, empathizing, or just rooting for the character.  Villains that you love to hate don't hurt, or even ones that you hate to love.  But I hate predictable plots or plots where coincidence fuels the story.  Like the author just put the male and female in the same place so they could meet and fall in love, even though neither of them had a any reason for being in that place other than the author needed them to meet somewhere.|`|5UC4h886aa	I look for themes and interesting characters. Also I look for styles of writing and ways to improve. What I don't like in books are type errors, boring plots that have a predictable pattern and lots of endless descriptive passages.|`|c6FrTkFRaa	I always end up buying a book because of the cover lol.    I buy a book because of the story line... and settings.

I think that everyone loves twists in the plot, irony etc. I think it is fun to 'kill' a lead character and then bring them back just to annoy the reader ;)  Also go with something unusual and new, no one likes to read what seems like the same old story over and over again just in a different format. Be creative and fun with your writing, don't use the same words too much like 'said' there are plenty of other words you could use instead. Also you should avoid using the word 'nice'. I enjoy Fantasy though, with a Dark Ages setting. But go with what you want not what you think everyone will like.|`|qi0BlGrlaa	it has to have a weird cover. like, think about it, would u buy a book with a flower on it...or a book with a picture of a never ending hall way. lol    and i like books that are romantic-comedy, and depressing  i dunno, crying at the end of a book makes me feel like...wow, that was amazing and thts a book i'll never forget.    and i dont like books with such a perky happy ending to it, where liffe is perfect and nothing can go wrong -_-  seriously, its not realistic  as in, a happy ending can be nice...if its not a perfect one    nyway...an example of a book tht was ammmazing...The Host   i cried, and the end wasnt tht much of a perky one. =P    nyway...gd luck ^^,|`|9iWqc5CNaa	A good story that is written well. Although a story doesn't fit into any of my favorite genres, if it's well-written, then I might give it a try. Characters are a very important part, there must be at least one character whom I can identify with or feel an attachment to. I don't like predictable endings; I want twists, turns, and surprises; and it doesn't need to be a mystery story to have all that. Suspense is nice, it keeps me wanting to read more. As for the settings, they can help draw me in, but it's really the story and characters that can draw me all the way in.

It is a perception and sometimes the tone doesn't come out of your mouth spot on unless you are paying close attention. If it truly was her business, you wouldn't have mentioned these last few comments.    It's probably just a jealousy thing. This is just a typical situation where two good musicians have bad blood between them, mutual or not. She either thinks very highly of you and wanted to give you a piece to show you off, or she thinks highly of you but wanted you to crash. There is respect there either way. Do what you feel is right. There is no right or wrong way of handling this situation.

ZB9zkbxxaa	As well as being one of the most popular, The Homecoming (1965) has proved to be among the most controversial of Harold Pinter\'s plays, at least as far as newspaper critics and academic commentators are concerned. There is no doubt that the action on stage continues to draw and hold audiences, as the play is frequently revived. The Homecoming shares a number of characteristics with Pinter\'s earlier comedies of menace. It is set in a dingy interior; there is throughout the play a sense of (largely) suppressed violence; the exchanges between the characters seem to be composed substantially of non sequiturs; the words that the characters actually say are divorced from what they mean (the meaning being discernible only by piercing what has been described as the irony and indifference of the surface); the naturalistic setting houses actions that smack of the surreal; the dialogue is conducted in language whose naturalism is subtly undermined, tuned, and poeticized. These are among the hallmarks of a theatrical style for which the term Pinteresque has been coined.    The play is concerned with the return of Teddy, a professor of philosophy at an American college, to the North London house occupied by his father, uncle, and brothers, all of whom seem to operate on the fringes of working-class society, some distance from respectability. Teddy is accompanied by his wife, Ruth, who then finds herself at the centre of a series of Pinteresque power-struggles. The men\'s attitudes towards women are decidedly ambivalent, as represented by the father, Max\'s, description of his late wife: Mind you, she wasn\'t such a bad woman. Even though it made me sick just to look at her rotten stinking face, she wasn\'t such a bad *****. Max presents his wife in an even more ambivalent light later on when he says: I\'ve never had a whore under this roof before. Ever since your mother died. So, the mother is represented as having been both a mother-figure and a prostitute. This madonna/whore binary can be taken as representative of the archetypical models for women that are perpetuated by the conventions of a patriarchal society. One of the primary functions of The Homecoming is arguably to expose the limitations of these archetypes. Jessie, the dead mother, is a figure whose absence is central to the play. Paradoxically, she is almost more of a looming presence in her absence than the figures who actually occupy the stage, an absent presence which is visually symbolized by the square arch shape demanded by the initial stage direction.    Among the men of the house a continuing, back-biting struggle for power rumbles along, characterized by ageism and mutual attempts at feminization, in which power accrues to the man most successfully portraying himself as virile and heterosexually active. Into the midst of this walk Teddy and Ruth. Teddy stands aside from combat with the other men, though not before suffering an apparent defeat

Not all of them have to rhyme and they don't have to be a certain length. Just be sincere about it. If you think the girl is pretty, or beautiful put it in the poem. Use inspiring words like breath taking, or enchanting. Use qualities about her and compare them to objects. "And her beauty out rivals the moon". Talk about her smile and how happy she makes you feel. Maybe this example will help, but try to come up with your own:    May these words touch your heart  so that your heart will smile  and reflect it on your lips    I long to see your smile  for it's brighter than any day  and gentler that any night    The stars are dimmed at night  for your mere eyes outshines them  and the moon grows cold and dark next to your fair skin    Ok, that was a little mushy and romantic but hopefully that will give you an idea.

c18Isnbyaa	The Great War was the first major conflict between European coalitions since 1815. Individual powers were not defeated in seemingly decisive battles because each had allies to take up the fight. Ranged against the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and Germany, joined in November 1914 by Turkey and in September 1915 by Bulgaria) were those of the Entente. Originally consisting of Russia, France, and Britain, they were reinforced by Japan in August 1914, Italy in May 1915, Portugal in March 1916, Romania in August 1916, and Greece in June 1917. When the USA entered the war in April 1917, the nations of South America followed suit, as did China. Much of the rest of the world were colonies of the belligerents, thus it was indeed a global war.    Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914 in a bid to reassert its authority as a Balkan power. Its determination was buoyed by the knowledge that it enjoyed the backing of its ally, Germany. But Serbia was supported by Russia, and Germany therefore confronted the danger of a war on two fronts, as Russia was allied to France. Determined to deal with France first, Germany needed Austria to engage Russia in Galicia. The result was that Austria-Hungary divided its forces, and suffered defeat on both fronts. The situation was partially redeemed by the Germans' defeat of two Russian armies in East Prussia. The Germans then shifted their efforts to the south, so as to give direct aid to the Austrians, and the two allies advanced into Poland in October. The offensive miscarried, partly owing to lack of co-ordination, but principally because the Russians crossed the Vistula westwards with comparable designs.    In the west the main German advance, swinging through Belgium in order to envelop the French, began on 18 August. The French, redeploying round Paris, together with the British, checked the now extended German armies on the Marne. Thereafter each side sought to get round the other's flank to the north. By October they had filled the space to the coast and heavy fighting around Ypres between then and mid-November failed to result in breakthrough.    The principal priorities of the British and French outside Europe were to contain the war by destroying the Germans' network of wireless stations and cruiser bases. Conversely, by extending the war to the Islamic peoples of central Asia and North Africa, Germany could threaten the colonies of their enemies. Her ally Turkey declared a jihad on 14 November 1914, while Britain had already landed an expeditionary force in Mesopotamia, and in March and April 1915 British sea and land forces attacked the Dardanelles. The Turks countered both threats, causing the British to evacuate the Gallipoli peninsula at the end of 1915, and forcing the advanced elements of the Mesopotamian force to surrender at Kut Al Amara on 29 April 1916.    In Germany, Falkenhayn's first instinct was to renew the offensive in the west in 1915, but the need to support Austria-Hungary, the greater fluidity of the eastern front, and the pressure of Hindenburg and his supporters resulted in a concentration in the east. A joint Austro-German offensive at Gorlice-Tarnow (2 May 1915) unlocked Russian Poland and the tsar's shattered armies fell back to the Pripyat marshes. Falkenhayn hoped that the Russians would accept a separate peace so that the Germans could concentrate on the west. But alliance loyalty held. Moreover, the entry of Italy on the Entente side in May prompted the Austrians to divert their already inadequate forces to a third front on the river Isonzo. By September the German advance into Russia had exhausted itself, and Falkenhayn switched his attention to the Balkans. With Bulgaria as an ally, the Central Powers outflanked and overran Serbia. Britain and France finally sent troops to Salonika in October, too late to influence Bulgaria and too distant to give aid to Serbia.    Although the Germans had not won on the eastern front, they had gained sufficient breathing space to allow them to turn their attention back to the west. On 21 February 1916 they attacked the Verdun salient. Their initial target was the French army but Falkenhayn realized that the financial and industrial hub of the Entente was Britain. He therefore wanted submarine warfare to accompany the offensive on land, but Bethmann Hollweg opposed him for fear of America's reaction. Britain's surface ships confirmed their control of the exits from the North Sea in the less than decisive battle of Jutland, and so Germany continued to be denied direct access to oceanic trade. By June the German attack at Verdun had stalled, as had the Austrians' independent offensive against the Italians in the Trentino.    Both Britain and France had learnt from a series of offensives in the west, either limited in objectives or limited in effectiveness, in 1915. At the end of that year the Allies agreed that simultaneous attacks on all fronts were the way to drain the reserves of the Cent|`|AA10725882	Darn, Marshall.  I have a 10 volume history of what happened during WWI, and that's a 1919 Literary Digest - an abbreviated version.  This is a vast topic which would require at least a full book length answer.    A good place to start is Barbara Tuchman's prize winning 1962 book "The Guns of August" - but that focuses on just the first month of the war.    If you want a general review, start with Wikipedia.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World...    "The Real War 1914-1918" (1930) by Captain B.H. Liddell Hart is about the shortest good book on what really happened in WWI - over 500 pages.    Here's a good site with an animated map http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/w...

TV - Shutter Priority (Time Value). Using this allows you to select the shutter speed. The camera then selects an f-stop which will allow proper exposure.    AE - Auto Exposure. In this mode the camera selects both shutter speed and f-stop. To avoid pictures ruined by camera shake the camera will always select a faster shutter speed.

zuZntfiwaa	The problem is, of course, that many of the most scandalous reviews were for plays that were scandalous themselves....    Look for the reviews of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Many of the reviews trashed it, saying George and Martha were really a gay couple made to look straight, because, after all, a relationship THAT dysfunctional could only be a gay one. They basically slammed Albee (widely known in the theater community for being gay, though not really anywhere else) for trying to make straight, "normal" people look perverse when they just couldn't be! Those reviews DID cause a scandal.    I know that George Bernard Shaw's play Mrs. Warren's Profession caused quite a stink when it was first produced b/c it was the 1st major play in the English language to deal with prostitution.    I'd also recommend looking for the reviews of any of Jean Genet's plays. The chances are good that you'd find a scandalous review of at least one of them, perhaps even one of the less scandalous plays.    Here's a book that cites Sarah Kane's play Blasted as getting "scandalous reviews" in England in '95 or '96 (I guess).  http://tinyurl.com/dfnntd    You should also try looking for any reviews of the Dada performances at the Cabaret Voltaire.    By "theatre production," can it be performance art? If so, then look for the reviews of Ron Athey's Four Scenes in a Harsh Life by Mary Abbe in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, which apparently "sensationalized" the performance and turned it into a scandal that was talked about on the floor of the U.S. Senate.     I'd also recommend looking for the books in the link below. Even if they don't have full reviews (and probably have a lot more reviews of fiction writers), some of the comments are bound to point you in the right direction. (I notice the back cover of one has a nasty comment about Samuel Beckett, so....)  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url...

Zyl2wBnPaa	There was the working or poor class and the upper class. One worked for the other. They didn't interact as friends. That was not heard of.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Yes, they did interact.  The poor people worked for the rich ones, and minded their place, or else got sacked.
NYU37jfGaa	The rich were expected to be charitable towards the poor, and would contribute to charities, and give to individuals who were in need.  A person who owned land for instance would normally be expected to take an interest in the welfare of his tenants.  Visiting the poor with gifts of food, medicine, etc, was an activity thought proper for Victorian ladies as it was for ladies throughout history.    Another custom that was popular in the Victorian era was that of making well-off children give some of their toys away to poor children at Christmas. This was thought to be good for them, teaching them about giving etc, but it could be embarrassing for all concerned.  In her autobiography 'The Joy of the snow' elizabeth Goudge wrote about how embarrassed she always felt going round to the houses of poor children handing out toys from a basket.  And the poor children to whom she gave the toys seemed embarrassed also.    Some Victorian employers had a social conscience and provided accomodation and welfare for their employees,  like the Cadbury chocolate firm for instance.    Wealthy people sometimes endowed hospitals, orphanages, libraries, etc, like Andrew Carnegie did for instance (I know he spent most of his life in America, but he was from Britain originally, and endowed libraries here as well as in America).    Social divisions in the Victorian era were in some ways more rigid than they had been in earlier centuries.  For instance, relations between masters and mistresses and their servants had generally been a lot more relaxed in earlier centuries than they became in the Victorian era. But there was a certain amount of social mobility, a person might start poor and make a fortune in industry for example, or more modestly obtain an education and join the middle class.

With a 2-gig card it will hold a little over 800 pictures, the zoom is incredible, clarity is superb. After you take pictures and you bring them back up on the camera (say a group picture of 15 people) you can zoom in on each and every person to crop just head shots of each one separatley  them. I say you should look at this one at the store if you already haven`t. I was looking for a camera with less options but after the girl showed me this one and what it could do, Wow, I bought it. And I love it , glad I got it . I don`t remember the options any more on the E420  but I am sure that one was nice to. Just get the one with the options you want/need. Olympus is a Very Good choice.

(I tried a 'self-portrait' and it turned out very well). he only drawback is that it's only black and white, but nonetheless its a good free tool.    Hope that helps.

NYU37jfGaa	Football matches could be very violent.  There were usually a great many men on both sides, and often the game quickly degenerated into a fight, with the players more interested in kicking each other than in  scoring goals. Sir Thomas Elyot described it as "a beastly fury and extreme violence; whereof proceedeth hurt, and consequently rancour and malice do remain with them that be wounded. . ."    Bear and bull baiting were very popular spectator sports.  A tethered bear or bull would be set upon by mastiffs (large fierce dogs).  In England in the 16th century, famous fighting bears like 'Harry Hunks' and 'The Great Sackerson' were national heroes, and Paris Garden in Southwark, the centre of the sport, drew immense and noisy crowds every Sunday, so that 'bear garden' remains a synonym for a place of disorder.  Thomas Platter described a bear-baiting:    'The theatre is circular, with galleries round the top for the spectators, the ground space down below beneath the clear sky, is unoccupied.  In the middle of this place a large bear on a long rope was bound to a stake, then a number of great English mastiffs were brought in and shown first to the bear, which they afterwards baited one after another, for although they were much struck and mauled by the bear, they did not give in, but had to be pulled off by sheer force, and their muzzles forced open with long sticks to which a broad ironpiece was attached at the top.'    Cock-fighting was another unpleasant sport that was considered perfectly acceptable. Entrance cost a penny so it was cheap entertainment.   Two cocks would fight until one died, and people would bet on the outcome, sometimes large sums of money might be bet.  This was still popular in the 19th century, Mark Twain's book 'Life on the Mississippi' contains a vivid description of a cock-fight.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Jousting and melee tournaments were still quite popular in the 16th century and beyond - participants were often seriously wounded, sometimes fatally.  King Henry II of France was an enthusiast who lost his life when he caught a lance splinter through the eye in 1559.|`|X1cYBjyJaa	Well during Shakespeare's time, people used to go to see other people make bears fight each other.

And it's even more to think that the God who created all of that, sent his only son; the son that he loved and cared for, to get nailed to a cross for you and ME. Man...I just can't fathom it.

8c2595d727227b01770787ec6351ad05aa	This question reminds me of my old punk leather jacket i have. I used stencils and spray paint to put/block out designs on it. One coat should do it. Acrilyc paint will do it but it won't be very durable.    If you have a hobby/craft store near you, you can get bottles of screen printing ink. A little heavier than paint but can be mixed just the same. That sticks to leather/fabric(and carpet/sofas/body parts...be careful!)  That's your best bet if it's going to be flexible or worn. Again one coat should do it. It might crack if you put too thick of a coat. Test it on a swatch before hand.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I would use Jacquard Textile colors.  It's a type of fabric paint that won't leave the leather quite as stiff as acrylic paint would.  Just paint or stencil it on and then heat set it with an iron once dry.  After that it's totally permanent.      If you Google the brand name above, you'll find several vendors on the internet that sell it.  You can get it in several colors, or blend your own.
NYU37jfGaa	I understand that at the beginning of the war many of the larger animals were shipped out to Whipsnade wildlife park, and some of the non-rare animals were killed.  But it was decided in 1941 that it was better to keep the zoo open, like other places of entertainment, and the animals were returned to the zoo.  I suppose the zoo was not a prime target for bombing, I imagine that the location, in REgents Park, was probably fairly safe.

"Irish Bulls is an informal philosophic dialogue on the nature of Bulls (logical absurdities) and jokes and jests in general. Published at the time of the Union, the overarching theme is the confusions of identity and the relationship of Irish people to the English."

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	His reign as James I was marked by unpopular policy decisions and uneasy relations with Parliament, who resented his assertion of the divine right of kings and considered him self-indulgent and crass. In 1611 he dissolved Parliament and, excepting what was called the Addled Parliament (1614), ruled without one until 1621. Raised a Protestant in Scotland, James angered Puritans with his support of the Anglican Church, and he frustrated both Catholics and Protestants with inconsistent policies. His personal extravagance and reliance on incompetent or corrupt court favorites made him increasingly unpopular and helped set the scene for the English Civil War under his son and successor, Charles I. The colonization of America began during his reign. Despite all the turmoil, he is probably best-remembered for commissioning the translation into English and publication (in 1611) of what is called the Authorized or King James version of the Bible.
PWwKcjwFaa	If you do a lot of location photography under extreme conditions, go with 1ds - solid build, longer battery life, and faster and more accurate AF (we're talking about fractions here). Suitable for shooting inside a dark, and very damp caves, war zones, arctic circle.    The big downside is that it's heavy and gets annoying after 2 hours.    If you shoot under controlled conditions and you call the shots, the 5D would be my choice. Suitable for wedding photography, fashion, features, in my opinion.    Image quality-wise, you can't go wrong with either. If you don't crop a lot, 8-10 megapixels is enough.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Always remember this: "its not the camera, its the photographer."

It was created in Spain by the famous chef Alonso Paella, who had fresh armadillos flown in from his supplier in South America.  The armadillo is filleted and then grilled over a medium charcoal heat until tender and then, for no more than 9 minutes, it is plunged into boiling water to remove any impurities. The Spanish were very good at grilling, which is why this dish has proved popular.  After cooking, the armadillo is sliced and placed immediately onto wooden plates (this is the traditional aspect to the presentation of the dish) and served with a side salad of crispy lettuce leaves, radish, cucumber and a portion of pilau rice.   The dish became especially popular in the Indian sub-continent (where the armadillo is slightly curried) and in Greece and the Greek Islands (where taramasalata and vine-leaves replaced the lettuce).  Armadillo de Paella, as it was known after its creator, proved very popular in other countries of Europe, except in Britain. The British dislike of the meal was prompted in 1588 by Queen Elizabeth who remarked after tasting it for the first time, "This is crap!"|`|P9RQ4mgiaa	Spanish Armadillo?    Simple yet effective...

It curled up in a ball.    The Spanish 'armada' on the other hand was the Spanish Naval fleet that attacked Britain during the time of Elizabeth I. I don't know everything involved in the war. Henry VIII, Elizabeth's father had been married to the Spanish Princess Catherine and threw her over for Anne Boelyn, Elizabeth's mom. Maybe the Spanish royal family was still in a feud with the Tudors. And maybe it was to get more land in North America. I don't know. But the word is Spanish Armada. You should be able to find it. If you can't, look up Elizabeth I of England or something like that. You're bound to find something about it.    If you are looking for Armadillos, on the other hand, try "Nature" on PBS or something.    Note: Some of the ships of the armada sunk off the southern coast of Ireland. The Irish, who did not like British rule, rescued some of the Spanish sailors. Some of them took in the Spanish men. Some of the Irish women and Spanish sailors, well,  as might be said today 'hooked up'. To this day, there are more dark haired Irish people along the southern coast than other parts of Ireland.

bi5g8V5Gaa	I have to agree with Robin, she suggested some great books!  I have a few more to add:    The The Black Jewels series by Anne Bishop (first book Daughter of the Blood)     Amazon.com Review  Anne Bishop's debut novel, Daughter of the Blood, is like black coffee--strong, dark, and hard on delicate stomachs. Within the Blood (a race of magic-users), women rule and men serve, but tradition has been corrupted so that women enslave men, who seek to destroy their oppressors. Bishop's child heroine, Jaenelle, is destined to rule the Blood, if she can reach adulthood. Her power is hidden; her family believes her mad. Saetan, High Lord of Hell and most powerful of the Blood males, becomes Jaenelle's surrogate father and teacher. He cannot protect her outside Hell, where he rules. She refuses to leave Terreille, risking herself to protect or heal other victims of violence. Can Daemon, Saetan's estranged son, keep her safe from the machinations of the evil High Priestess? Or will he lose his battle to control his destructive urges and endanger her?"    The Banned and the Banished series by James Clemens (first book Wit'ch Fire)    Amazon.com Review  Wit'ch Fire grabs you in the first scene, and doesn't let go until the very end. This is the beginning of a new fantasy series--the Banned and the Banished--by first-time author James Clemens, but its sophistication and style are reminiscent of experienced fantasists such as Guy Gavriel Kay and George R.R. Martin. Elena is "the wit'ch of spirit and stone," born of a deadly alliance between three powerful mages in fulfillment of prophecy. But can she learn how to use her powers in time to resist the forces of the Dark Lord? She is joined in her battle by some unlikely allies, but the motley crew may be the only hope for a threatened world. Clemens handles plot and characterization deftly, but the addition of lots of un'neccesary apos'trophes to let you know you're reading a fantasy is a little distracting. Still, Wit'ch Fire is a fast-moving, entertaining read that's definitely worth your time.    The Incarnations of Immortality series by Piers Anthony (first book On a Pale Horse)    Review  The first of another five-book fantasy series from the prolific, YA-ish, popular Anthony - centered on five "Incarnations of Immortality" (Time, War, Fate, Nature, Death) in a messy and illogical science/magic setting. The focus here is on Death, starting with the suicide preparations of guilt-ridden, down-and-out Zane; in comes skeletal Death to claim his soul - but instead Zane shoots Death, and so is obliged to assume the office himself. Zane's ostensible function: to collect and weigh those few dying souls that aren't primarily good or evil, but balanced between the two. But he's really being manipulated by a powerful magician and the other Incarnations. . . who are out to foil Satan, who's hatching a vile plot to start World War III. It's Luna, the magician's comely daughter, in fact, who is fated to stop Satan.     The Mage Storms series by Mercedes Lackey (first book Storm Warning)    From Library Journal  In the face of a growing threat from the mysterious and powerful Eastern Empire, the lands of Valdemar and Karse attempt to form an alliance despite old prejudices and misunderstandings. Readers familiar with the author's previous Valdemar series ("The Mage Winds," "The Heralds of Valdemar," etc.) will enjoy the return of favorite characters, while a vivid assortment of new protagonists continues to expand the wealth of cultures present in one of fantasy's most intriguing universes. Lackey's talent for evoking the youthful passions of her heroes and heroines brings life to this creation. Recommended.  Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.

Hamilton revitalized vampires, werewolves, and zombies in the popular Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter books. In this new series, she updates faeries. A Kiss of Shadows introduces Merry Gentry, a.k.a. Meredith NicEssus, a faerie princess of the Unseelie Court, where politics is a blood sport. Merry, who's part sidhe (elvish), part brownie, and part human, never really fit in. She's short, not skilled in offensive magic, and mortal because of her human blood. These are real liabilities when your family, especially aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, is out to kill you. Merry has been in hiding for three years, living in Los Angeles and working for the Grey Detective Agency, which specializes in "supernatural problems, magical solutions." A new case sets her against a man who uses forbidden magic to seduce fey women and drain their power. A plan to trap him goes awry and Merry's cover is blown. Now Andais knows where she is. But things have changed in Andais's court, and Merry is changing too.|`|Aij8qBYpaa	I would suggest checking out books by tracy hickman and margret weis. I read dragonlance chronicles and legends all writen by both authors and found that there was a nice mix of adventure and romance. I know that they both write fantasy that isn't dragonlance. It's worth checking out.|`|AA10954273	You might like Sorcery and Cecelia by Patricia C. Wrede and Carolyn Stevermer.

They also ignored the info you gave us.      Ok, you're looking for straight out sword and sorcery, rather than generic any fantasy. Here is some.    Terry Brooks' Shannara series.  Sure it is a thinly veiled Tolkien rip-off, but hey, that doesn't keep it from being a good series.    Fritz Leiber's Fafhred & Grey Mouser Stories.  These short story collections are, simply put, some of the best sword and sorcery tales out there.    R.A.Heinlein's Glory Road.  Yes, he is a sci-fi master, but his fantasy stories are great too.  If it isn't on the shelf grab Magic, Inc.    Gordon Dickinson's the Dragon and the George.  He tried to turn this into a series and failed, but the first book is worth reading, just expect the worst for the rest.    Glen Cook's Black Company series.  S & S, if it was written by the grunts, rather than the princes.     Ok one I don't recommend all the time, but like the dragonlance series, it was written by a D & D fan.  Raymond feist's Riftwar series, starting with magician.|`|de0e13b53b8247e94598d0825137ca7baa	Sara Douglass' series, The Wayfarer Redemption, Enchanter, and Starman.

Kushiel's Dart, Kushiel's Chosen, Kushiel's Avatar,  Kushiel's Scion, Kushiel's Justice, and Kushiel's Mercy.  All thick, meaty books full of adventure and romance.|`|zccL7tBmaa	The Sword Of Truth series by Terry Goodkind is really great.  It is a lot more advanced than Harry Potter but i have found it really enjoyable. The first book is Wizard's First Rule.  It has 11 books in the series if I'm not mistaken.  As someone had already said the Shanara books by Terry Brooks are really good and you might try looking into those.|`|dJuEtGxraa	If you are looking for a romance, that's thick, and filled with adventures and is a fantasy novel. I suggest you read the Twilight saga series. Its suited for Fantasy and romance, they are each around 400-700 pages. Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn. Trust me, you wont wanna stop when you start reading. ALL BY STEPHENIE MEYER~    Hope that helped~|`|9X0nHkdWaa	Twilight believe me read it the first 5 pages are a bore but then you became an addict!!! 0_o|`|SLhIlXjnaa	Inkheart, Inkspell and Inkdeath by Cornelia Funke|`|2Q26FpDoaa	The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant by Stephen Donaldson is an amazing fantasy series, up there with the Lord of the Rings but easier to read.  There's no romance that I can remember though.  There are three books in the first chronicles (Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War and The Power that Preserves), three in the second chronicles (The Wounded Land, The One Tree and White Gold Wielder) and the 3rd chronicles is supposed to have four books but only two are released yet (The Runes of the Earth and Fatal Revenant) with the others expected in the next couple of years.  Brilliant read!!|`|oa1YH5l7aa	Cornelia Funke's Inkheart trilogy, the Pendragon series by D.J. MacHale, and Harry Potter are the ones which pop into my head when you say "adventure". Apart from those, Mercedes Lackey writes REALLY good books. She's written over fifty, but one of the best I've read is Magic's Pawn. Bards and music, romance, royalty and adventure ... it has it all.
b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	Ignorance and the PC brigade are to blame for the reaction that is prevalent at the moment , They give such high profile to any race issue that it is counter productive and creates hatred . Myself i am white  and Peter my best friend since childhood is black , and has been my friend  from the early fifties (  one of the first immigrants families ) I took much stick then, but that faded away with time until the PC brigade raised there ugly heads and now my friend has noticed a marked change of atitude that we thought had long gone. They have a lot to answer for.|`|Kl56NSmLaa	Ah, a genuine question.    Some thoughts...    I used to think that I had no prejudices, but then I spent three years working as a conductor on UK railways. I lost count of the number of times I was called a "racist" for:  - asking someone to show a ticket  - asking someone to buy a ticket  - asking someone to move out of "first class" when they didn't have a first class ticket    Being told "You wouldn't hassle me if I was white."  Etc.    And, for the record, I always asked everyone to show tickets, black, white, whatever.    Now, whilst I am still well aware that it's not good to generalise, nevertheless, I find my attitudes have changed. In particular, whenever there are claims of "racism" or "institutional racism", my first response is "ah, chip on shoulder". Not good, I know, but there you are...|`|kxN5kKryaa	I'm of mixed race and to be honest no one that I know, black, white or purple is offended by those things. The current government thinks we are, therefor changes things to suit us when we don't need it and then the white people start getting annoyed because of it... they blame us and blah blah blah...     Lets just get along, I'm too lazy to fight. =P|`|KsQYf2ISaa	Picking on black people for their colour alone is about as stupid as putting people with freckles to one side just because they have freckles. In fact, since we're on the topic, I don't like people with brown hair, can we push them to one side? Also, Davids, they annoy me. Rachels! Chuck 'em all out.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	kill em i say|`|uIzTvsbcaa	Well, when you come to think about it all that racism is is fear. Bob Marley said that until the day the color of a mans skin has less signifigance of the color of his eyes this world will know war. That is wrong and i pray that you stay strong through everyones comments. God bless you, you sound like a nice girl. Peace|`|ZaoMZe6uaa	I think you're hearing more racial hatred lately because our new president has placed race in the face of those who hate. He hasn't done it on purpose, but simply the fact of the color of his skin has sent all the racist bells a whistles off in people who hate or have fear in their hearts.  It has brought all the insecurities that white people have about other races to the foreground.  I know President Obama wanted to play down his impact as a black man achieving the White House in the United States, but I think the effect is bubbling to the top.  It has forced white people to look at the black man they work with or see on the bus slightly differently, and that always makes one unsure, which can bring out fear. There can be no complacent racial superiority. Those that are fearful will fall back on hatred to make themselves feel stronger again.    What those people don't understand is that it only makes them look weak, afraid and stupid.|`|XRX2sgniaa	No. Bugger off.|`|1L8ETufRaa	lately! lol, it's been happening since man was created.  and anyway the world is progressing - Obama for instance.  props only 50years ago we would never have a black president   for US.  But we have horrible people in this world who think they are better. White people & black people think this. (not all lol)    Just don't get miffed about it! The people who are racist or just sh*ts and need to get with the programme!     I know what you mean about PC. Yesterday I was with my friends and we were talking about family guy & I asked, 'which one was Cleveland again?' & my friends replied 'the black one' and then then this girl next to me sort of gasped and look at my friend (he's black) I was like o'cummon lol, how is that offensive. and my friend who is black was, got embarrassed becuase of her silly reaction.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	People who are unsatisfied with their lives feel the need to blame someone else.

ndXvMLZ2aa	The Windmill     The great windmill symbolizes the pigs' manipulation of the other animals for their own gain. Despite the immediacy of the need for food and warmth, the pigs exploit Boxer and the other common animals by making them undertake backbreaking labor to build the windmill, which will ultimately earn the pigs more money and thus increase their power. The pigs' declaration that Snowball is responsible for the windmill's first collapse constitutes psychological manipulation, as it prevents the common animals from doubting the pigs' abilities and unites them against a supposed enemy. The ultimate conversion of the windmill to commercial use is one more sign of the pigs' betrayal of their fellow animals. From an allegorical point of view, the windmill represents the enormous modernization projects undertaken in Soviet Russia after the Russian Revolution.|`|DFT6tYepaa	Personally I think the windmill represents the building of communism in Russia at the time. However it was destroyed by someone else. This shows how Russia didn't actually become a communist country.    Snowball represents Leon Trotsky who hoped to build communism. In the book it was Snowball's idea to build the windmill. But Napoleon who represents Joseph Stalin, drives him out. In reality Trotsky is driven out of Russia by Stalin's secret police.

36a3ynpJaa	Many immigrants end up getting a new last name by accident when they come to America and it gets past down.  Like in the movie, the Godfather, Vito is not born "Corleone" but he ends up with the name when he comes through Ellis Island.   In the old days many people were named with their parents' names and then ended their names with "de Larentus" or whatever meaning "from Larentus"  So my guess is her father came into the country as just "Enrique" or whatever and they just gave him "Spanish" as a last name to indicate that he was not Haitian.
AA10093245	To me, the difference is asking it it has some kind of use. Crafts have some use, art is basically pleasing to the eye but not practically useful. Making a little basket from popsicle sticks has a use. Making a little birdhouse from popsicle sticks has a use. Painting on canvas is art because it has no practical use. Painting flowers on an old dresser falls under craft, since the dresser has a use.  But you're right, some things would be hard to draw the line. Dale Chihuly crafts some wonderful art in glass, which is not only decorative, but can have a use. There are modernistic sculptures that are art, but can have a use, like sitting on it in a park, or making it into a useful fountain.   Some things are easy to distinguish, some are not.|`|ISPIa0n5aa	You sure can.  Draw the line right down the middle.  Art is photography, painting...  Crafts are when you glue popsicle sticks together and make a house, or make a quilt, or make a purse...      The two shall never be confused.|`|ywoKvBInaa	i think crafts are like making things and art is like on something like a canvas or something|`|mHsRlpLFaa	Personally, and heavily influenced by my experiences as an Early Childhood Educator, a craft is product-based (ie: gluing Popsicle sticks together to make an ornament), whereas art is process-based (ie: exploring the feeling of paint on your finger, where you just happen to make a painting as a result). I also find that art is more open-ended, exploratory, and creatively stimulating than a craft which has a specific method and result.    Hope this helps :D|`|W5h7UfZmaa	yes this a lot of difference ,craft is gluing, sewing , pasting and adding things could be pictures in a book or quilting , art is DRAWING PAINTING ,SCULPTURE you could not put the last 3 as craft so they are ART|`|UOqi5ZkRaa	Art is a form of communication; probably the oldest form of communication.  Art can communicate ideas, beliefs, stories, feelings, emotions, etc. Crafts are generally thought of as utilitarian, however, crafts can often cross over into the realm of art.  Quilts are a perfect example, because they can be used to keep you warm (utilitarian) but the fabrics and patterns used can often communicate complex stories and histories as well as evoking emotions and feelings (art).     So it's a blurry line but basically if the object does not communicate then it is not art. And believe me there are a lot of drawings, paintings and sculptures out there that don't communicate and so should fall more into the craft category than art.
oHO0XOQVaa	It depends on what the primary purpose of it is. If it has a strong concept behind it's a piece of art. If the purpose of building it was to make something beautiful more than making something useful then art is the main purpose also.  If you just wanted to put something nice on a jewelry box to make it more interesting, or you needed a jewerly box so you just made one then it's a craft.

8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	This was asked yesterday as well. According to legend, Rome was founded in 753 BC. However, archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied earlier than that. Romans did not have accurate accounts of the city's early history, and so 753 should probably be pushed back another hundred years or so. The Western empire fell in 476 AD, and the Eastern part was conquered in 1453 by the Ottomans. Most people only count the West as the Roman empire, with the east being known as the Byzantine empire. However, the Byzantine empire was a direct continuation of the Roman state, so it can qualify as Roman. Measuring to 476, Rome lasted 1,229 years, or 2,206 years measuring to 1453. But remember, Rome was probably founded before 753 so these numbers are low.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	The true Roman empire, not the holy roman empire . started at 27BC and ended at its fall 437AD 464 years ,The city of Rome was founded 700 years before but was not an  empire until 27BC when it had captured most of the know world,  After the Visigoths conquered Rome it was no longer a true Roman empire even though a splinter Eastern culture  still existed they were more Eastern culture than Roman .they were called the Byzantines.|`|AA10425091	24,000yrs.|`|1ZeNgdUaaa	The city of Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. and Rome was sacked in the 5th Century C.E.

The end is really up for debate, because the Empire split and non-Latins became emperors.  The traditional end is 476 AD when Odoacer sacked Rome and ended the Roman system of emperors, but then again...  The East Empire or Byzantine Empire which was and is considered to be the "Last Roman Empire" didn't fall until 1453 when the Ottomans sacked Constantinople. I would say technically not until 1453, but for "traditional Rome" 476 AD.    So either it was 503 years or 1480 years.    Now some people are going to say: "But Rome was founded in 753 BC"  They are right, but you asked how long did the Roman EMPIRE last, not Roman Civilization.|`|sTIlnVDAaa	Empire about 1200 yrs because of the Byzantines. When the ottomans captured Constantinople (Istanbul)|`|H55nCLqPaa	We don't really know when the actual city was founded, archeological evidence suggests as early as perhaps the ninth century BC, but this was really a simple collection of huts nothing that could be called a city. You could define the beginning of a Roman ''empire'' in several ways. You could say that it started with the imperial system in 27BC under Augustus as some others have mentioned.     I however would say Rome became an empire at the close of the first Punic war in 241BC because at this point Rome acquired her first truly foreign territory; the new province of Sicily. Even though the republican system lasted for another 200 odd years, I would say that Rome clearly had acquired an empire long before the emperors took control. By the time of Augusts they had North Africa, Sicily, Spain and Gaul.    As for when it ended I think the ''official'' point of 476AD is good enough. The empire itself slowly fell to pieces under assault from Visigoths, Vandals and other Germanic peoples but the Roman government was officially overthrown when Romulus Augustus was deposed by Odoacer. Other posters have mentioned the Eastern Roman empire, however the eastern Roman empire wasn't really roman at all. It was far more Greek in character than Roman, in fact the language they used was Greek so I wouldn't really count them as having continued the Roman legacy.    So the Western Roman Empire lasted from 241BC to 476AD, some 717 years.|`|1MMIwkfsaa	Roughly 1,500 years if you take the weakened Eastern empire known as Bysantium into it.|`|lw3AUOM3aa	east rom existed until th 15th century but only the state, it wasn't really like a roman empire anymore, so like until 640. the western part existed (if u want to be really nice) until the 7th century.|`|ooCvJWPHaa	800 BC- 476 AD.
fZQ2uK1Xaa	The trade magazine for science fiction and fantasy is Locus. In each issue there is a listing of sales: who wrote what book, what publisher they sold it to, and who the agent was.    You want an agent who a) knows fantasy and b) knows the fantasy publishers and c) can sell.    The Writers Market book is a useful resource, but the publication timeline for it means it might not be up-to-date for the particular listings you are interested in. You should always check the publisher's/agent's website for current submission guidelines. Did you include the SASE with appropriate postage? Did you give a current e-mail address?    Keep in mind that it can take from two to six months for an agent or publisher to reach your manuscript in their stack of reading. If you have not heard after 4 months, you can send a polite letter to confirm that your manuscript was received. Always remember to include a cost-free way for people to respond; publishers can't afford to pay postage or long distance phone charges for every inquiry.    The markets are tough right now. Your submission must be as close to publishable as possible, and competition is fierce. Persevere.|`|YorMkZYAaa	If your query letter and manuscript are anything like this post, I can understand why you're not getting a response.

ReTRqbn8aa	You seem to have researched your subject matter really well (or have had a lot of experience in this field), which is great.  Here are a few pointers I have:  The text is very dialogue-heavy; try to avoid just one character spinning out a monologue - of course they have their place, but they are usually dramatic or emotional in order that the reader pays attention. Sometimes the characters sound like automated reports - allow their character to seep into their dialogue. Some people have choice phrases, speak a certain way. Try to incorporate that.  Know your character - what are Mrs Smith, Fran and Jett like as personalities, or what are Fran's first impression of Jett as a person? Who is Robi? Elaboration is key, which brings me onto my next point.  Description is lacking - set the scene, ease the reader into things, have Fran describe the people around her, her background, perhaps even her family, her hopes, her fears. How did Fran become paralysed? If this is something you want to disclose later on, allude to it early on (e.g. "I try to push out of my mind the day of the accident. My doctor tells me to think positively, which, to me, is just another way of saying "We can't do much more than hope.")  An instant fix to your story would be the addition of paragraphs, as well as grammar going beyond the simple comma (try semi-colons and dashes to separate your thoughts).  The beginning and ending should deliver the most impact; whether or not your story is finished, if you're submitting it as an episode, think soaps. It doesn't have to have the schmaltz and cheese, but begin on a note of intrigue to draw the reader in and end on something dramatic e.g. a new discovery, a closing thought etc.  Best of luck with it, I think if you add these details your story could be really powerful.

QPr6XYXUaa	First start by stretching everyday. Bboying isn't all about flexbility but it would help you a lot in the long run...but you are right about strength. It very important to have upper body strength.  I would suggest really stretching your quads, hamstrings, you know the basic stretches.  Then work on your arm strength, do as many pushups as you can atleast 50 to start with, lift weights. Build up your arms.  Nah 14 not to old, break dancing isn't about technique so much so you will be fine. JUst have fun, and be careful! = )  Hmm some basic moves are the coffee grinder, baby freeze.

Make sure you eat well (obv) and do some other sports as well to get you physically fit.running or swimming are good ones to do. As well as lifting your weights. Upper body strength is vital in breakdancing.    Also make sure you stretch well!

They followed up the book with a sequel, "The Wyvern's Spur," which followed two characters from Bonds - Olive Ruskettle and Giogi Wyvernspur.  Then, a few years later, they released a third book called "Song of the Saurials," which followed the two main characters of Bonds - Alias and Dragonbait (the others weren't in it).  The entire thing was tied together and marketed as "The Finder's Stone Trilogy," and that's what it is.    But it's not a trilogy in anything but name.

nujen4dmaa	Blood Diamonds are rough diamonds controlled by certain factions which are sold to fund illegal activities and military conflict. The diamonds are mined and sold illegally. As a result many thousands of people are enslaved and subject to human rights abuses.     Some people maybe of the opinion that all diamonds are Blood Diamonds. Others may be concerned there is no way to tell if the diamond they are buying is conflict free.     When buying diamonds you must ensure that you are buying from someone who can guarantee that you are buying conflict free diamonds.    This online Diamond Boutique http://Whiteflash.com guarantees conflict free diamonds as they have purchased directly through legitimate sources not involved in funding conflict and in compliance with United Nations Resolutions, in accordance with the Kimberly Process and the USA Patriot Act.    They are also a social responsible company that realizes the gravity of the loss and damage to human life from the sale of Blood Diamonds.    As a result they have created 2 lines of jewelery. The first one is called Dreams of Africa, (http://dreamsofafrica.org/) where 100% of the profits go to WCCI (World Centers of Compassion for Children International). The second is called AWEAR which is a jewelery line designed for children. Whiteflash hopes to build global awareness among youth for this cause. 25% of the profits from AWEAR will go to WCCI to support the healthcare and educational development of child victims of conflict diamonds in those countries affected.

AA10276642	Prior dance training is the only way to physically prepare for an audition. If you're familiar with the structure of a dance class, it's the same for an audition for a college dance program. For a program like Akron's, you're not trying to show that you're a perfect, star performer. You're just trying to show that you're a good dance student and that you love dancing.     Your behavior from the moment the dance faculty can see you should demonstrate that you're eager and open to learning new dance movements. Always pay attention to the teacher and be bold about carrying out their instructions. It's actually better to dare to make mistakes than be meek and withdrawn in your movements. Then, if you do make a mistake, calmly do your best to apply the corrections that the teacher gives you. The teacher needs to see that you're actually trying to do something different on the next attempt with grace and determination. Rolling your eyes and otherwise revealing through your body language that you've made a mistake and you're upset about it are actually worse than the actual mistake. Professional dancers make mistakes all the time; you just don't know it because they make it look like it was supposed to be that way.    If you can, try to treat the audition like a performance, with the judges as your audience. If you truly love performing, your natural love of dance should shine through on your face. This means that your face should show neither a scowl of concentration, nor a fake smile around your mouth that doesn't reach your eyes. But if you have to think too much about that, then don't bother. Lesser-trained dancers have a hard enough time focusing on their arms and feet. At least do your best to avoid nervous tics like biting your lower lip or doing weird things with your tongue.    Hope that helps!|`|b8IA5ly7aa	I think you should think about majoring in dance.....thats like a baseball player "majoring" in baseball......if you can dance you can dance-a dance degree isnt going to get you any farther at an audition.  If your good your good.  I would seriously consider majoring in a practical subject that will get you a real job.  Majoring in dance isnt going to guarentee your going to make dance a career...only how good you are is.  Im a college graduate and I know many friends that majored in dance and have no jobs as dancers and are having hard time getting any job because their major means nothing.  Take your time and money and energy and just audition- you are in your prime and cant afford to spend your early 20s in a class room when (if you really are good enough to make it as a dancer) you could be audition and getting jobs.
swg3BhLXaa	Yes you can. Ballet isn't a *need*, but it will help because it contains the fundamentals that will help you to excel at other types of dance. You will increase your flexibility, coordination, and balance ... all necessities for every type of dance. Plus, a lot of the jazz moves (leaps and turns in particular) are ballet moves with modified positions. Ex: instead of turning your toes facing out before you jump, you would turn your toes to face forward (or parallel).    There are a few options for shoes and it will come down to personal preference and what is most comfortable for you. There are jazz shoes that cover the entire foot and then there are others that are more "strappy." You can also get "foot thongs" which are like the front part of a sock with the toes cut out.

Some of them worked for female suffrage, others for temperance, and still others for immigration restriction, government inspection of foods and drugs, the abolition of pornography and prostitution, or the improvement of wages and working conditions (especially for women and children).

DUH9gJa1aa	Sondance speaks a lot of truth.    But every clown has got to start somewhere.    A very inspiring book for me was Clown Ministry by Floyd Schaffer. A book like that can give you some ideas. Not just ideas of what to DO but ideas of what to BE.    I believe a clown should be a servant who wants to give people a positive experience. One NZ entertainer says "Clowns love people." Another of my teachers said, "To a clown, nothing is as it seems."    If people would enjoy spraying you, that could be good, and if they would enjoy being sprayed by you, that could be good, too.    Maybe you start with just that one gag. That's fine. One friend who I was encouraging to be a clown said she didn't know what to do. I told her to just take one prop and use it for everything. She came back very happy. She had carried a little stick and with it she had made music, and directed people, and grown flowers...    Although I want to be encouraging, I don't want clowning to be treated cheaply. When people see a clown, they usually react positively because of their previous encounters with clowns. Don't leave them less positive for the next clown they meet. Don't just exploit the goodwill that clowns have, contribute to that goodwill.    Please take clowning seriously. You don't have time to prepare a great act before Friday evening. (Here in New Zealand it's already Saturday morning!) But go into it with the intention of continuing with clowning afterwards.|`|p7eUxwFkaa	Just be yourself  lololololololololololololololololololo...   hey i could be a clown|`|UsTyc0oeaa	Real clowns do not spray people with seltzer bottles.  Real clowns do not do anything to people that would hurt or upset them.  A clown may spray another clown, or another performer, but would never spray a member of an audience, so the issue of their consent wouldn't even come up.    Becoming a halfway decent beginner clown takes several months of intense training.  Real clowns learn how to put on makeup so that it looks good and friendly, not grotesque and scary.  Real clowns, even beginner ones, have skills that they could perform at the party that people would enjoy, such as juggling,  balancing objects, and physical comedy.    People who claim to be afraid of clowns often say that it is because they "had a bad experience with a clown" at some time in their life.  In fact, the reality is that most of those experiences were not with real clowns, but with someone dressed up in a clown suit that had no idea of what they were doing or how to behave like a clown.  If you do as you described, this is the likely result.  Not that you intend to be bad at it, it's just that without knowing what you're doing, there is little way that this could turn out to be anything less than a disaster.    Since this event is a fund raiser, you would be much better served by contacting a full time working clown in your area.  Hire a real, professional clown, not someone who performs mainly kiddie parties and doesn't know how to entertain people over the age of eight.  Real clowns know how to perform for all audiences.  Get a pro who knows how to perform comedy that adults would enjoy.  Pay them their fee, and have them "busk" money from the other party goers for the charity you are raising the funds for.

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"The Barbarian" by Judith E French  http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Bar...  "In 315 BC in Alexandria, suffering from amnesia and listening to her kind host the Pharaoh Ptolemy, who insists she is an Egyptian aristocrat, is easier to swallow than the emptiness of knowing nothing about herself though flashes make her wonder if he lies. Though having some doubts, she accepts the Pharaoh??s words as truth because Ptolemy also insists he loves her and will take care of her forever.---- However, reality changes when Kayan the Barbarian arrives at Ptolemy??s palace and sneaks into her room. He insists that she is the Princess Roxanne, whom he has always loved even when Alexander the Great took her from him and married her. With the conqueror dead, Kayan wants his beloved to go home with him to share the love denied them even as his arrival prompts her to remember that she is Roxanne the great warrior princess. Together they might be able to escape her luxurious captivity, but Roxanne wonders whether she wants to be the pampered prisoner or warrior princess as she also questions whether she still loves this barbarian as he insists she once did?---- This exciting sequel to the fabulous historical tale, THE CONQUEROR, is a wonderful look at the ancient world just after the death of Alexander. The story line will delight readers who appreciate a vividly picturesque look back at Egypt, Persia, and to a lesser degree Macedonia and Greece. The romantic triangle is unique hooking romance readers as few ancient historical tales have. Combining strong fully developed characters, a sense of place due to the colorful descriptive locals, and a beautiful haunting romance,"|`|6kue5meiaa	Not really an answer here, but you might try asking the various librarians at your local library.

0LgpcOBDaa	Are soft boxes worth buying?    Sometimes, however, there are a number of items you can use to achieve the same EFX..    The milky white plastic found on many plastic gallon milk containers work fine if cut and held in front of your flash. Small plastic bottles of the same like material could be used by just cutting off a end and slipping over the flash head.    Remember, necessity is the Mother of Invention and you have to ask your self, do I want to look good, or do I want pictures that look good..?    Any kind of a box that can go around the flash head, or as a screen in front of the flash head, with a diffuser screen or material out in front will most likely give you what you need. A domed hood will allow light to travel in more directions than a flat one will, but either can and work better than the harsh bright flash alone.    The white plastic found in many plastic bags, kitchen trash bags, etc, will work fine too if a holder is devised..    Think out of the box and in your pocket.    I have taped lens tissue or even used dryer sheets over my flash to soften them. Just remember, you cutting the light down a number of f/stops and camera adjustments may have to be made.     Again, experimentation cost nothing but a lil time, and the looks of a home made item for "nothing" vrs the looks of a commercial item for $30, 40 bucks or more almost out weigh them selves right there when $$ is tight.    Happy experimenting..    Bob - Tucson|`|3TqPF1zMaa	The answer entirely depends on what kind of photography you want to do, what your subjects are and any difficulties that you're having that you hope a softbox will help with.

iNXqiDIYaa	In the late 1980s, Dent forecast that the Japanese economy, then the darling of the world, would soon enter a slowdown that would last more than a decade. In the early 1990s, he predicted that the DOW would reach 10k. Both of these predictions were met with much skepticism, and yet both eventually came to pass.    In 2000, Dent predicted that the DOW would reach 40k, a prediction which was repeated in his 2004 book. In his book, he also predicted the NASDAQ would reach 13-20k. In late 2006 he revised his forecasts to much lower levels, estimating the Dow would reach 16-18k and the NASDAQ 3-4k. In January 2006, he predicted that the DOW would reach 14-15,000 by the end of the year. It ended 2006 at 12,463, 11% below the lower end of his prediction. It ended 2007 at 13,264, again significantly lower than Dent's revised prediction of 15,000 by early 2008. Since then, the Dow crossed 14,000 in late 2007 before retrenching.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dent

hl4kkvXhaa	I wouldn't advise changing anything in the way of fonts if you know that you have followed each publishing house's guidelines (Remember, each individual house can have their own separate guidelines so you need to check).      Self publishing is good, if you know which publishers will be accepted by book sellers.  So, if you go that route, look for a publishing service that offers things like marketing and print on demand services.  More booksellers will be likely to pick you up if you use a print on demand service.  That way, they aren't having to order a ton of books that might not sell.    Starting your own company sounds great, but there is a few huge problems.  First, you'd have to hire people to help you...editors, staff, and etc. because you'd have to publish other people's work to stay afloat.  Just publishing your ten books probably wouldn't even pay back the capital you would need to buy the equipment, let alone pay for the materials, marketing, and everything else.  Not only will you have to market your book, you'd have to market your company.  And, in today's economy, I think it would be harder than ever to find reputable book sellers to pick up books by unknown publishing houses.  If you're still interested in this as an alternative, be sure to have your business plan and proposal in place.  Even if you don't need to get a loan, these things are essential (current business student).  Also, do a lot of research in the publishing industry so that you know what you will need and exactly what you will need to get started.    I would advise you to first seek an agent.  An agent will know which houses you would fit into and which ones are financially stable enough to publish your work.    I advise seeking out an agent, as I said, and waiting it out.  Just spend time improving your skills while you are waiting for the right publisher to come along.

I guess I prefer just an isolated novel.|`|AA11111233	One Isolated novel.  I prefer good books that one can read for English Class in High school, which is the goal the novels I'm writing.  I don't know of any serials that are like that.|`|KbffpAxTaa	i like them both, but i think i have more single books. its hard for me to finds a series that i like. i think i agree with you mostly.|`|XbTZEm6paa	An isolated novel    Although I get more obsessed by series especially when they have film adaptions|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy and have read the series based around Jack Ryan. Loved it. Ken Fol let has a two book series that is fantastic.    http://www.ken-follett.com/bibliography/...    World Without End and Pillars of the Earth are a great read. Go poolside with those two this year and you will not need another book for the two weeks!|`|kFnzYrrnaa	I love a good series, they're the kind of book that you can read over and over and they hardly ever get old. But I think that if a book is really great then it can stand on its own, those last in my memory more. And I think its harder accomplices. I mean, we'll always remember Harry Potter, and Twilight, but those will never be taught in the classroom and still teach us the kinds of things Shakespeare and Faulkner can.|`|tGDOZrUTaa	Something that has not been brought up is that the series must, must be published at a fast clip, or it becomes frustrating to readers, who may leave it.    For example, Scott Lynch's Locke Lamora/Gentleman Bastards series. The first two books were published once a year, but the third book is in publishing woes and has not been published yet (roughly a year and a half later). I really liked the first two books but am getting frustrated by not being able to read the third one, and am losing patience with the series. When the third book DOES come out, I will likely be less excited with it due to the waiting, not more. That's a peril of series that I have seen a lot run into, particularly in fantasy.    There is definite strength in having a single, isolated story. (Look up the film 'Hamlet II' to see what goes wrong with unneeded/unwarranted sequels, haha!) Particularly if the novel is sparsely written or deals with some sort of unique imagery, it loses its 'special' vibe when it explains things that shouldn't have been explained, or continues stories that shouldn't have been continued.    Each story has its own pace--the trick is knowing what that is.|`|BzMQejGxaa	Fantasy, YA books, and chick lit are the only books that really work with a series, as they are stock characters facing different situations each time.    I prefer novels, I think. Whilst we may want to hear more from the characters in our favourite novels, generally we can tell that this is the right place for them to end. Series can be cheap because a writer will stay too attached to characters and then destroy their personalities.|`|1a0cdf84b10327b2e35d799092f75617aa	I prefer a series, just because like you said, i want to know what happens to them after the book ends. But, if i find a good isolated novel i'll read it lol|`|14ZoC4pwaa	i guess... i would have to say that it all depends on the story and how it ends, it'd be perfect if the books were a collection ex: like different characters same world thing, then  you at least have familiarity|`|kC8i88d2aa	series
AA10766729	Youth longs for the liberation that age brings.      Age yearns for the freedom that youth had.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	because when we are kids we imagine all the things we can do as an adult... no authority over us... we answer only to ourselves... and once we grow up and reality hits us with all the responsibilities we wish we were kids.. with no responsibilities....|`|DlL98tVHaa	because children constantly see the things that they are not yet allowed to do and they want to do them too because they think that it makes them happy.  and we constantly tell them "wait, until you are older, you are not allowed to do this, you are too small, let it be, you cannot do it, you are not old enough" etc.  so they think it is desirable to be grown up.  but once you are grown up you see how effortless it was not to be able to do all the things that grown ups do, because you have to be responsible, you are worried about certain things, you have to take care of the kids etc.  we should help them enjoy their freedom and joy instead of telling them what they cannot do.  they are real masters of joy and we can lear finding our inner joy again that sometimes gets lost in the daily worries and fears in life.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	We all are motivated to finish things, to complete them.

I'm older and I still can't wait for the new day to discover my new gift.    Like Christmas day when I arose early with anticipation.    Sometimes I don't see any gift boxes, but, tomorrow maybe.    If time stopped, I may have to live with no more gifts.    I've lived a long time and lost most of my gifts.  Now, I'm still waiting, but, I'm sure I have missed seeing some.

Children look forward to getting older because there is a goal at some point of their independence.  We as adults have more solidified goals that we acheive daily without our age playing a role in our happiness in order to acheive them.    Getting old brings wisdom and insight to others I look forward to it all.|`|Nbozr7Dcaa	I guess we do a good job of making life look easy.  I used to want to grow up so I could smoke cigarettes. geesh.  I think kids today are smarter about their goals/objectives.|`|DQdYUF1daa	I believe that children look forward to getting older because they want to be able to do what they want and know everything. Adults want to stop time, I think, for 2 possible reasons. Either, because they realize the excitement you have when you're a kid is gone. Everything is old to us. Nothing gives us that rush we use to get over the smallest little thing. We know so much that nothing is new. Or, they fear death.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Children look forward because they look at what's ahead of them; they look at models (parents, siblings, teachers, friends, etc) and "wanting" to be just like them whilst most of us are afraid of dying and accepting the fact we will be gone at some point. Others are afraid of letting their beauty fade and to stay young forever, which is not possible even with all the botox and lipos that they have to offer.|`|a1cLXGwxaa	Yeah well like peanut wrote i agree i want to get older to escape the watchful eyes of my mom and grandma! ha for those of u girls that have only one person scanning you feel lucky i have 2 !|`|nXZEoDO7aa	Thats why they are kids.. they are Naadan . masoom .. they dont know anything.. they think it will be better when they grow up.. but they dont understand what golden time they are having...|`|ioLun57Caa	When I was 16 I went into a local convenience Store and bought a six pack of beer. I had waited for that day to come and it arrived. Back then you had to be 18. I began going to bars and yes one was a bike operated nudie bar. Now it is over 30 years later and I wish I was a kid today now that the laws are more strict and they actually pay attention to such things. Back then I was going after what I thought was cool. Between that and street fights driving without a lic I was lucky I never went to jail. Very lucky.|`|8ekoa6szaa	Children do not understand the concept of death and those of us who are older do.  The older we get the better we understand that our time is running out and the harder we try to stop time.  Unless a person is mentally ill, s/he does not WANT to die, and their survival instinct kicks in making them resist dying.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	This is a societal based notion. Some cultures do not value youth, and sexual ripeness. In those cultures the wisdom of age carries more value.  In fact, (though I can't think of the tribe's name, but), I heard in a lecture given by Deepak Chopra, that there is a group of people where the expectation is, that the older you get, the better you get. They have races in that community, and the older people consistently beat the younger.  Along these lines, there was a study done among seniors, where they were isolated for 2 weeks, listening to the music and culture of their 20s, and they were found to have significantly lower age markers than an otherwise identical control group.  Back to your question, it's a cultural thing, where a culture values certain things like youth, it becomes something to hold onto. Holding on to something, out of fear of losing it, is pretty much a guarantee of losing it. eventually.  I do wish to add, there is nothing wrong with passing years, it is certainly possible to look, feel, and perform at 60 better than you did at 20, if you mind your diet, drinking, exercise, and avoid toxic habits.  Many people say, "If I only knew then, what I know now", taking care of yourself can put in the best of positions.|`|I13rHn1Waa	cozzzz its the fact that when we r children or enter the young age, we wanna grow up fast and hv fantacies for future....  but when we r into the situation with lots of responsibilities or stresses in life, we wish that we could stop time.....  its human tendency|`|aIzKbpQGaa	the grass on the other side is always greener  i hope i am able to express my point..     anyways... actually children think that their elders are just ordering them and misusing their powers, hence they want to exercise their independence for which they wish to grow up fast  whereas adults are facing a load of responsibilities and hence want to go back to their childhood days when they were yound, free & careless|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	All that children see ahead of them is life and opportunity.

We may have our own perceived dreams, and we look forward to grow up to have them realized.    We grow up and see that there are too many obstacles and nothing comes with ease. We may make our dreams come true, and realize that we have sought something worthless, that the true meaning of living has not yet been realized, and we'd wish to stop time until we are able to figure out the present before having to deal with an empty future, and then the closure of death.   We may not have our dream realized and the passing of time would only keep on reminding us of failure, so we'd rather have it stopped.|`|4861f9e17bcef08d8f5e36f917de504eaa	Children have a sense of anticipation, and, some thrill from that anticipation, looking ahead for a time that still is a kind of mystery to them: on the other hand, the elder ones have transited through youth, they know that the energy and enthusiasm in youth cannot be recaptured at any time ahead of them! So, the elders want to 'rewind' and get back to the 'good old times' if possible, while the young ones are impatient to get to a 'place' they can explore, a place of freedom and indulgence they imagine possible and enjoyable in the years ahead! This, in short, is the trick that life plays on all of us, to keep the drama going!|`|q4BQq5wLaa	Because the childrens have not yet faced the reality of the world. They still believe in their fantacies and are unaware of the true fact of life. They feel that their life would be the same later as it is now.  But the grown ups have faced the sufferings of the world. They know that people here have something else going on in their minds but they act differently. They have experienced the cruelty, the untruthful world. They know that life is not like the hide and seek that they played in their early ages. They realise that everyone talks and preaches of love but never act so lovingly.|`|AA11918249	Hello:    Children are treated like...well children and they see how adults treat each other and so they want in on the good stuff we do and say and so on.  On a certain level I remember adults being kinda cool in that they could do whatever they wanted and had cars and stuff and sure they had to go to work but I had to go to school...so same thing right?      So kids want to get older because they thing its super cool (its all right really, but its worth waiting for...for real).    Pretty much in the USA once you hit 21 there is not a lot of reason to want to get older...maybe to be taken more seriously, but all in all once you know that you are going to die someday (and I mean you actually get the idea...as in accept and kind of understand what death is) and then you really don't want to speed things up.      Children don't get death and if they do then maybe they don't understand time.  Then again maybe we don't really understand time...but thats a different question.    I hope this helps    Rev Phil
zuZntfiwaa	This is definitely one of your better things, Elys. Truly your own vision, fleshed (and husked) out to take you from reality to dream. The God stuff ain't me, but I ain't the poet!    On your use of "anger/angry": seems more likely you're talking about other than mere anger---may be different realities of it for the exploring.    But COULD mere anger cause all that you describe? Maybe so, if it's held on to for so, so long, and built onto, deftly, for so, so long.... But repetition is a form of change; surely something more monstrous comes out of it? What food you get(less and less)'s less filling: the hollow leg fills with gall, the belly button brims with bile.     On instances of "anger/angry": seems you could just say "Thinking back on ages when I was spinning anger in webs." Seems you could just get rid of "anger" in 2nd stanza. Seems leaving out any more "anger" till that belly in the end makes that belly better heeded, heavier with its need for redemption....|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	I love it. I know what anger is and what it can do to your insides. Relinquish my will to seek revenge and betray my need to prey on others leaving behind me tell tale evidences of the damage I have done.

Some things can have an irreversible effect on you and those around you. The list includes    - addictive drugs like marijuana, cocaine, etc. Staying away from alcohol and cigarettes is also a good idea. For some of the more addictive drugs, even a single time is enough to get you hooked. And once you're addicted, it takes many years of effort to get off it, often leaving permanent damage in your brain, muscle, and other vital organs.    - being sexually promiscuous may feel good temporarily, but getting STDs is not fun. Not to mention the frustration and anger you may cause if even a single one of your partners like to treat relationships seriously.    - operating motor vehicles carelessly often sounds fun and "cool", but really, once you get hit by a truck and have to spend the rest of your life on a wheelchair, how "cool" does it become? Risking injury and even death for a few moments of excitement certainly isn't worth it.    - gambling. It is extremely addictive, yet nobody ever seems to win in the long run. Why try it in the first place?    the list goes on and on. Before you do something, just think: what effect will this have on me and those I love when things don't go as planned? Remember Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong.|`|MCJAYZeZaa	You probably shouldn't experiment with killing yourself and then trying to bring yourself back to life.

Qzv4ySYaaa	If you haven't already seen it, I suggest you view the movie "Thirteenth Floor" made in 1999 starring Gretchen Mol, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Craig Bierko in which the characters come to realize they are indeed part of a video game.  Needless to say, God is capable of and very likely does create parallel universes.    I've always believed that earth is a "textbook" created by God for the angels.  If earth is God's video game, its entertainment value is secondary to its educational value for the occupants of Heaven.    I've always been taken aback by religious people who totally discount this world and say they can't wait until they die and go to Heaven.  Our world has a very significant purpose and should not be discounted.    As to your question who or what is God, the movie, Thirteenth Floor" may have a possible answer.  Does God "download" into His or Her own video game to participate?    I get the impression you are a deep thinker and very philosophical. perhaps religious.  I would therefore recommend another movie with Armin Mueller-Stahl, "The Third Miracle."  I believe the movies, The "Thirteenth Floor" and the "Third Miracle" are two of the most profound movies made in recent times.|`|FToLSzm8aa	Life is Gods comedy play ....    and people just dont get it !|`|FoIxsunVaa	No. YOU are the movie.

The burning oil field in the background leads me to believe he's cleaning up the skies now and is looking to take out oil burning in the future.

cEa8TTenaa	You have to start with short stories. Send them to online or print magazines. It'll take a long time before any of them take anything you send. Expect rejection as a way of life. Eventually, if you keep at it, some will be published. They may or may not pay you. Keep a list of publishing credits. Start writing longer pieces. Read a lot. Practice. It takes a long time.  Publishing is a difficult industry but, in brief, here's how it works:    You keep sending stuff out until someone actually reads it. Then you write a book. Then you send it to a hundred publishers. Then one publisher might offer you a contract. (But only if you have a publishing track record with lots of credits.) They will take a risk that your book will sell, and go ahead and print it, warehouse it, get it reviewed, distribute it, promote it and so on.They will give you something like 12 percent of the cover price. So if the book sells for $20, you get $2.40. If you have an agent, they take about 12 percent of that, so you are left with $2.10. And that's it. If your book sells a thousand copies you get just over two thousand dollars. That's better than nothing.    Self-publishing means you take the risk. You pay for the printing, distributing, promotion and all that. Trouble is, book shops very rarely accept self published books. The same goes for distributors. Why? Because they don't sell. People only buy books they HEAR are great, mostly from other people, or if they are already bestsellers. People love bestsellers. So how do you sell your self-published books? You can't, really. Unless you have a stall at a Sunday market. But why would they buy your book?  So you are left with a box of books under your bed for the rest of your life. The bright side is you have total control, but of what? If you pay to get published, you need to sell a lot more than a thousand copies to break even.    You can self-publish for free, at somewhere like lulu.com, but only family and friends will buy it, and only if you hold a gun to their head. It's true - you make more dollars per copy, but how many friends do you have? Make a list of people who are likely to buy your book. (I have about 300 friends and relatives, only about 15 ever buy my books) Let's say forty friends (some are couples, they'll only buy one) so you sell 40 x $8.50 = $340.00    Very few people sell more than 50 books on lulu.com    Before you do anything, join a writer's blog, read publisher's websites, go to sites that explain the industry... and if you still want to do this, good luck.|`|EktKaBXuaa	this will answer all your questions.

I6dcRgD6aa	I have a bunch of old cassettes & I was amazed at hearing how I was different when I was younger. My son is 31 but on the tape he must have been about 8 years old. I was getting his voice on tape & I had a list of questions I was asking him. I am so glad I did this. One of the questions I asked him was "what is your favorite dessert?" well my son thought about it & then asked if he could give 3 instead of one. I said NO & he said he couldn't decide & then I moved onto the next question. I was so hard & strict. I would have said all kinds things differently now so I am surprised that I am nicer & more creative now.|`|X7z0KWXbaa	yeh i get what ya mean, like every year the people in my photos change and its like god how i must have changed to have a different group of friends each year    it is a strange feeling, knda makes u wonder what made u change and how it happened without ya noticing    wow i must be feelin philosophical    but yeh for a random thought thats a thinker|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	Yeah, it's so weird to look at someone and know it's you but it's not, you know?|`|2pq3y2ghaa	I think wow!

Whose philosophies at the time were evident without reason.     Nevertheless, i have a strong affection to the boy i was, if the only reason being he (at the time) believed he was so completely alone in the universe.

s4WywJ8baa	This was written a few years ago by a friend of mine.    Getting Started  Hey girls, I am truly delighted to receive a number of letters from young ladies (and men) who want to model and are seeking my advice on how to go about it.  But what I find MOST inspiring is these girls (and the guys who ask, too) recognize the importance of finding a mentor.  A good businessperson will tell you, if ANYONE is going to succeed in ANY task, we/they/you are best served to seek the advice of someone who is already succeeding in their field and I'm flattered to be viewed as a successful model.    Volumes of modeling advice have already been written by other professionals who possess far greater experience than I.  And I am not going to attempt to repeat what they've done.  Instead, I will point you to the best source I've found, so far.  However, I will share some of my biggest mistakes in the hopes that they save others from repeating those same mistakes.    First, don't ask if you have what it takes!  As a businesswoman, and just as a woman, I want to help you understand why that is such a mistake. Frankly, it shows you don't believe in yourself.  It communicates to others that you are so unsure of yourself and your abilities that you require validation. One of my biggest gripes with the current education system is the fact that grades are given.  Guess what -  I don't get a report card every nine weeks so there is no little slip of paper telling me how I'm doing.  So don't think that a kind, caring, compassionate teacher-figure is going to help you.  In fact, the opposite is true, people are going to try to take advantage of you!!!    That leads nicely into my second point and that is, you are going to make mistakes!  AND BLESS YOU!!!  The more mistakes you make, the better you will be.  If you are NOT making mistakes, you're not moving!  There are precautions you can take to ensure that your image isn't being used to tarnish your modeling name.  You never want to get into a situation that compromises your morals or personal code of conduct.  To put that in simpler terms, don't do anything illegal or anything that puts a knot of guilt in your heart! If the photographer starts using phrases like, "Next time we work together, you can show a little 'down there', maybe... and once you're comfortable, touch yourself and flirt with the camera" -- never go back!  You have caller ID, ignore his calls if you don't want to confront him.  Just DON'T RETURN! You don't have to give up your dignity to get ahead in this business, but you do have to have "IT"!    What is "IT"? "IT" is a passion that burns inside you so intensely that others can see it.  "IT" is the confidence in yourself that instantly dismisses the words of the "hater du jour".  "IT" is charisma.  "IT" is humility.  "IT" is compassion.  "IT" is integrity. "IT" is kindness. "IT" is confidence (yes, I said it again)!  "IT" is patience.  "IT" is drive.  "IT" is focus.  The instances that come to mind of someone earning celebrity status without "IT" are not happy stories.  Keep in mind, the names you know best worked long, hard, & exhausting hours to get where they are.  If you want an easy job, modeling is not for you!    The last pearl I'll share on the "IT" topic is advice one of my favorite photographers, Jonathan Simms shared with me as a comment to the first "girl talk" blog: Make up artists, hairstylists and great locations are one thing but ATTITUDE is the key. Something girls, Teresa, is not short of, and what aspiring models better be long on if they want to succeed in this biz!! You guessed it - that's part of "IT".  Don't think that photographers want to listen to some whiney princess about her legs hurting from holding a pose, even though in all likelihood, a four-hour shoot will leave you physically exhausted and your muscles will be begging for mercy. This isn't Romper Room!  No one is here to diaper your bottom.    The fact of the matter is that coming into the biz, you will have dues to pay.  For every model that makes a name for herself, there are hundreds who end up serving beer and wings until they finally leave modeling behind them. If you're willing to sacrifice a few years of partying and playtime, you have a chance.  But if you believe you can have your cake and eat it, too, continue filling out job applications. The photos look glamorous, but if you've viewed every photo of mine on the internet, you're seeing about two hours of my actual labor in front of the camera from over a year of working countless twenty-hour days.  Sound glamorous?|`|D9x1QSgiaa	If you have money to blow, you COULD attend a "Modeling School or Academy".....but they are not always what they are cracked up to be. In fact...I would venture to say that MANY of the best, well known professional models have NOT attended a modeling school. The problem is that MANYYYY of them are nothing but a "front" for a photographer. Of course they will insist that all of your photos come from this ONE photographer...so it's money, money, money. Most ad agencies won't ask the model if she was "schooled" by a professional Modeling School or not.     Experience is more important than school. It doesn't really make much difference if he or she was or not formally trained. I have gotten excellent results from the models I have used who have NEVER attended a Modeling School. If they are given 10 minutes of coaching they usually catch on well.     What IS important in the process is your ability to make a GREAT portfolio...that is....a decent album of your best shots in a variety of setting. That includes bikini photos, head shots, formal wear, product promotions, you name it. The portfoilio must display the model in a variety of settings and backgrounds to display to a potential advertiser that she is versatile and capable of promotion the product or merchandise in the way that reflects best on the company. I have used many models who never show their face....so good looks don't ALWAYS carry a lot of weight either.    Age 13 is a good age to get going in THIS business.....many models are starting at around age 12, 13 or 14. I suggest that you find a photographer who is will can capable of helping you make a portfolio. Some photographers (such as new photographers or college students) may work with you on what is known as TFP...(Trade for Photos)...in other words.... you sign a Model Release allowing the photographer to use your photos for FREE and he supplies a good selection of photos for you to keep (for FREE) in your portfolio. One hand washes the other in this kind of agreement.   Also....your BEST choice of Modeling Agencies WILL be in the larger cities...New York, L.A. , San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami, etc.....but I don't necessarily suggest that you move, until you are better established. Also...don't be afraid to post a few photos HERE for us to see as well. Be sure to have an online presence at websites such as modelmayhem.com, onemodelplace.com or other such sites. Making your OWN site featuring YOU (and ONLY YOU) is also a great idea. You need business cards with your face on them and your website address. You need to print flyers with 3 or 4 great shots of you. They need to be mailed to modeling agencies (not the schools), ad agencies, and anyone else you can find who could use you in the promotion of their business in any way. Agencies DOOOO look at these sites from time to time to scout for new talent. There are probably some decent photographers in the YOUR area or some other nearby larger city.  Good Luck|`|df33eaa9d9fa77a930c76a56de1aa68aaa	Put together a portfolio first and begin by working with a local photographer as a model for his work. If you are under 18 years of age make sure that you have an adult supervising your efforts and the photographer descretely.  It can be done, but be very wary of predators and the slave market.|`|x5q0HM55aa	get a photographer, book a photo shoot, build your portfolio, get interviews in modeling agencies, sell yourself at castings.|`|kG8j4uqaaa	Hi, Don't be sad. A lot of it has to do with luck but if you keep persisting you will get there! I've been modeling for a few years and when I started out I almost quit a few times because I was getting rejected a lot more than I was getting hired.  What I eventually did was I joined an internet modeling agency because that way you get exposure to all over the world, not just in the city you're living in. At the time I was living in California and I started getting a lot of jobs in New York. So I flew out there and apparently I have a much more New York look than I do California and I started booking jobs. So I would urge you to join an internet agency because that way people will find you (and believe me they will) and you will know what to target, or if you have to move like I did.     Also, the main thing I learned about starting off in modeling is that people like to see a more natural look. If you're going into auditions or castings, let people see your natural beauty. They want a blank canvas. Simple clothes, just a tad of makeup. That way they can see your potential. Those are the two best peices of advice I can give you. And of course don't give up if it;s really your dream!    There's a lot more good information here:    http://antmcycle12.blogspot.com/    Including a really good internet modeling agency which is the same one I used to get started.     Good luck!
q7z7Ni3Daa	Sorry, I can't tell if anything is a direct quote here or not. If so, that would have to be changed.You also don't give an appeal; you make it. There need to be some connections between the ideas to make it clear what you someone else said and where your comments are. =)    By 2006, the year the article was written, the adult obesity rate had risen in over 31 states, according to a report from the Trust for Americas Health. Here Rosenwald made his first appeal to pathos. This crisis was now within our homes, even more so than it had been in previous years.     The author is trying to appeal to American values, and one can assume that most, if not all, people value their health, so to hear that the obesity rate is increasing is an eye-opener to people.|`|BYdjgGVDaa	According to an article published in the Trust for America's Health(2006), Rosenwald gave his first appeal to pathos, as adult obesity rates rose in 31 states.

sgApJkSmaa	If you like photographing technical details (gadgets, machine parts, scientific instruments, electronics) then industrial photography is an amazing field to be in.    It is a niche specialty, quite challenging, and requires a scientific eye for those little details. It is one of those photography forms where you can create a lot from very little, while also developing larger-than-life exposes of say, megastructures or Boeing airplanes.

0dU50gc9aa	first off, he should have never mocked you. as a teacher, it is his responsibility to be the adult and he made a poor choice. that being said, did you take it too personally? i know i have been in situation where someone made fun of me not meaning anything personal. people don't realize when something hurts us very deeply and you're obviously self conscious of the way you walk already otherwise i dont think it would have hurt you as much. but this is very personal to you. he probably doesn't realize that. have you communicated to him your issue? i think maybe if you told how it hurt  your feelings and your sensitivity to the issue, maybe he would apologize and realize that it hurt you more than he ever realized. i would try to explain to him. you can do this face-to-face...you can write him a note...or you can ask another adult (parents/other teachers) to explain to him what the real reason for your quiting.     i'm not sure if i would go back...there's bad blood between you two b/c of a lack of communication. i don't think you're responsible. but sometimes you have to be the adult when adult can't seem to be one themselves. i also have a tendency to talk a lot and i would have ASSUREDLY explained to him how unprofessional, immature, and disrespectful he was if he even dared to come at me like that. tough situation! but it's even tougher not to quit. maybe you two can bridge the miscommunication gap and get thru it! good luck.|`|2K6hHhUaaa	well dont worri heel get over it  maybee you should just saii well if you didnt tease me so much i wouldnt of quit  u neva no maybe he ws doin it as a joke xx|`|pA8odCpuaa	He's a dra,a teacher! He's trying to have fun with you and help you!!|`|7X9AzA2Zaa	A teacher should NOT be talking to you like that or making fun of you!  He has lost out in your acting, so you should not go back!

iNXqiDIYaa	Warner's life was chronicled in the biography "Gertrude Chandler Warner and the Boxcar Children" by Mary Ellen Ellsworth, illustrated by Marie DeJohn, which tells the story of Warner's childhood living across the street from the railroad tracks, her bouts with poor health, her teaching career, her earliest attempts at writing and her inspiration for The Boxcar Children.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcar_chil...

sBseCETSaa	Breaking Dawn was totally lame. Compared to the previous novels, it was a huge let down. The author used many quick fixes to solve dilemmas in the story line. Jacob imprinting on the baby was the worst of them all. Also, in the end when Alice mysteriously discovers the half vampire from the Amazon... it was like saying, "Ha! Look we found one! Don't kill the baby!"|`|JEP4CmyUaa	No, it was totally not lame! But if u think it's lame i dont mind coz people have their own opinions.|`|7iV0dIpGaa	No it was definately not LAME!

Even though im 14 I don't share the opinion of all the teenage girls out there with Twilight Saga obsessions. Although it was a very sweet love story, making everyone crave for a man like Edward in their own lives, it was very clicheed in my opinion, especially the end SPOILER..............it was to happily-ever-after for me. Maybe it would have been more intresting with a death.|`|kC8i88d2aa	no|`|IiFFPlIZaa	I Know!! i literally just finished it there about 5 minutes ago...  at the start i thought wow a baby!!  didnt see that coming! then the jacob point of view was good! then the voltri thing was abit.. amm.. drawn out, annoying and predictible! they didn't even fight! stephenie meyer should've got some good battle scenes there. everything was abit too lovey dovey and cheesy at the end... there should have been more deaths maybe, more sacrifices to save others..  it was all just bella worrying then... nothing...  but maybe i expected too much...  plus the whole "happy ever after" chapter name gave everything away grr|`|IDtrNQ1vaa	i think it was too commerical.

Or you could write books, or choose another career that might get you in the public eye.    But the odds of you becoming famous through an acting career are about as good as you getting struck by lightning.  I have a dear friend who tried for years to become an actor.  He studied, went to the right schools, played in as many parts as he could get--and then finally started a catering business. He meets all the right people and I know from having watched him act that he's good.  But he just never got the right break and acting is mostly all about being in the right place at the right time.

To me personally? Do you have an hour or two, while i bring up ethics, metaphysics, Epistemology, Psychology, Lingual Analytics, all while citing several noted texts, such as Kant, Descartes, Jeremy Bentham, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Platonic Forms and several others.  Then i would have to sit for an another hour and try and define "meaning" in its purest form for individuals, shortly followed by a tea break. Then afterwards i would try and resolve the duality of existance, and the connection between mind and experience, and the various actions and philosophies one takes to question inherent meanings, and try to rectify what reality means for me personally.

I believe that life is filled with meaning from beginning to end.  Can you speak of a rainbow without colors?  So too, you cannot speak of life without meaning.  Everything you do has meaning.  Every word you speak has its effect, and every thought that passes through your mind lives forever.    So then be careful how you nurture your soul.  Seek truth.  Practice love.  And, Relish beauty everywhere it is found.  That is all you need to know about life.  That is all there is to know about life.
s4WywJ8baa	An internship in photography?    Well, internships don't pay.     Those "jobs" require a lot of skills not related to photography. Answering phones, paperwork, sending correspondence. Good typing and spelling skills are required... something you will learn in "collage".    And any photos you may take while interning with a photographer will belong to them (its usually in those types of contracts).    Best to stay in school, go to 'collage', and strike out on your own as a photographer. You will learn the business aspect of it in college.

From 625 BC to AD 476 = 1101 years ! - And if one includes the eastern Roman empire which lasted until AD 1453 it would even be 2078 years !

rvaXSVjcaa	It is a good and very enjoyable world that Terry Brooks created, though he follows the same recipe in later books.    Its a very long history to discuss briefly without giving anything of the plot away but here goes:    Original Shannara trilogy: Sword, Elfstones & Wishsong of Shannara - first is about Shea Ohmsford, only descendant of the Elven king Jerle Shannara. Second is about his grandson Wil, third is about Wil's children Brin and Jair. The 3 books are stand alone novels but you should read them in order.    Heritage of Shannara tetralogy: Scions, Druid, Elf Queen and Talismans of Shannara is set 300 years later and deals with the Ohmsford [Shannara] descendants. They should be read in order and the four books deal with one story of the these descendants' quests to save the Four Lands.    Journey of the Jerle Shannara trilogy: Ilse Witch, Antrax and Morgwar. Set 130 years after the books above, also about the Ohmsford descendants, Grianne and her brother Bek.    High Druid of Shannara trilogy: Jarka Ruus, Tanequil and Straken. Follows directly on the trilogy above and is about Grianne again and mainly Bek's son Pen, though Bek also makes an appearance.    Prequel to Sword of Shannara: First King of Shannara - is about Jerle Shannara and should be read only after reading the original trilogy.    Word & Void trilogy as well as Genesis of Shannara trilogy are books set in our world and time [more or less] and tells of the beginnings of Shannara. Strictly speaking the Shannara series is set in the very far future of our world, a world that was remade after the Great Wars [i.e. read nuclear world war, everything wiped out except some ruins] and where people have lost most of the technology associated with the Great Wars. Magic now rules where technology once did.    High fantasy, epic quests, likeable characters and interesting villians. Although not the best fantasy novels out there, I would definitely recommend it.|`|r68xD4JFaa	It's worth reading.  It owes a lot to Tolkien, but a lot of other series do too.  IT has the stock elements of this style fantasy.  You have long quests, which involve magic, varied races of odd beings, strange locales, and evil doers.  You have world wrecking wars, lost items etc...    It is Tolkien Lite, but it still beats 90% of the junk that is out there.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	www.goodreads.com    Gives you reader reviews and comments.

WZNaNvplaa	The first thing to point out is that sexuality has always been with us, no matter how repressed the culture.  All those biblical laws about adultery, rape, and even bestiality were written for a reason. During the Puritan times it wasn't uncommon for girls to get married after becoming pregnant; the prospective husband wanted to be sure that he was getting a fertile wife. The Victorian era, well known for its public disapproval of things sexual, was also notorious for the variety of sexual offerings that could be found in the right places.     Going on to modern times, the battle you talk about is different in one major way than all those eras. We live in the information age. A person can communicate with others, usually anonymously, with others all over the world. The effect this has on those marginalized minorities you mentioned cannot be overestimated. No matter how isolated one is in ones society, it is becoming increasingly easy to reach out and talk with others who share your personal habits, tastes, and inclinations. With this support, it is more common for people to stand up and push for their rights. In that sense globalization is helping bringing the "hidden taboos" into the open.     But the conservative/fundamentalist groups cannot be written off as ignorant, or stupid. They have learned to use the same internet and propaganda tools as those they seek to suppress.  And they have one weapon in their arsenal, so to speak, that makes the fight a dangerous one, especially for those in the minority. Namely, violence.  Especially when tied in with religious law, making murders of those who are different legal, the fight for recognition is all the harder. As for who is winning, for now, I couldn't say. I simply don't have enough information about conditions in certain countries to determine if the fundimentalists are winning, or if those trying to bring their sexuality into the open are gaining ground.

lw3AUOM3aa	WWI was won because of the better material the allies had, they invented the tank and the machine gun. This two inventions basically won the war. The russians were at that point already defeated by Germany. BUT it is very probable that the Allies also wouldn't have won without the help of the amercians. The british population was starting to be against the war because of all the casulties they had and the gov was thinking about signing a peace treaty with the German gov.    WWII was certainly won because of US help, the British would not have been able to open the 'Westfront' without American help and if there wouldn't have been a front line in western europe, the whole german army would probably been sent against the Sowjetunion and a victory in that case is almost sure.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	During WW I American troops and material tipped the balance on the Western Front. The Germans were shocked at the ferocity with which American Soldiers and Marines fought.  American material largess was only just beginning to come into the field when the Armistice was signed.    During WWII the "Arsenal of Democracy" was the 600 Lb Gorilla. without it the USSR would have been defeated in 1942 and England would have starved. Also the output of US factories and shipyards made it [possible for the US to fight in 3 oceans and on 5 fronts simultaneously. The USSR only had to contend with 1 front.    The Axis defeat was dramatically hastened by the continuous bombing of Germany, tying up huge resources that could have been employed to defeat the USSR.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The Russians won the war, not the US. And they probably would have eventually succeeded without the US, too. But the US certainly did in the end provide important help to the war effort by busying Hitler in the west.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	In WW I, Spanish influenza really won the war.  So many people died that there weren't enough left for a decent war.  The Americans arrival only extended the inevitable.    In WW II, Hitler's madness and meglomania would probably have led the Germans to defeat anyhow, but the Americans arrival there shortened the war considerably.  Even more advantageous, though, was the arrival of American supplies.  The never-ending train of trucks, tanks, planes, fuel, and ammo spelled "victory" in any language.|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	In western history/lore, the D-Day invasions were massively impressive, but in truth, the most impressive contributions to the allied war effort in WW II was not the manpower but rather the weapons "loaned."  Not only did the U.S. loan/lease weapons to England, but also to the Chinese and the Russians.  That the industrial infrastructure of the U.S. remained intact was a vitally important asset to the allied forces.|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	I agree that the Russians likely would have beaten Germany in the end, but not without the war lasting much longer. Had the Nazis been able to relocate their western divisions to the Russian line it could have been a stalemate. Besides that, the Russians played no part in removing the Nazis from North Africa, which was a crucial step in cutting the Nazi's oil supply. The threat of invasion from both England and Sicily kept many German units tied down.    Here's something to consider. If the US had not been at war with Germany during WWII, that would have meant we probably wouldn't have been at war with Japan either. Had Japan not been fighting us, they likely would have overrun all of China. Japan and Russia were technically at war too, but there was little actual fighting as Japan was busy with us and Mongolia served as a buffer between Siberia and Japanese held China. If Japan had been free to invade Russia from Siberia, would Russia have been able to defeat both the Nazis and Japan?|`|XJWeuLPoaa	the russians were the only ones who were really wininng the war...but when it definitely helped alot when we came lol|`|G2JHunHjaa	Gosh!

e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	I agree that it is our History, instead of a racial issue...the problem that has arisen is that the "Stars and Bars", which is actually the Battle Flag of the Confederacy and not the official flag, has been hijacked by many extremist organization, such as the Neo-Nazi movement...in my opinion that is why it is viewed as a racist symbol...to stop this, I think as a collective people, Southerners, we should start and organization and Copy-write the flag so we can limit it's use...what I find funny is the NAACP complained about Georgia's State Flag having the "Stars and Bars" on it...but the new Georgia Flag is actually a version of the Official Confederate Government' Flag...|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	only as an example and reminder of how I myself as an american can be an idiotic american|`|WvAwQmndaa	Yes there are a lot of ppl who use the Rebel flag in the wrong way. Those racist people sometimes aren't from the south. But when i was in Jr high, Mississippi, where im from, was having lots of hearings to decide whether or not to take the confederate flag off of the state flag. We asked a lot of african american students and they said they didn't mind the confederate flag. I don't think that people who live in the south mind it at all. It is more the northerners that find it offensive.  It is a part of the US's heritage, and I don't think it should be regarded as a racial issue.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Quite true, and I feel that the Confederate national flags and the battle flags should be reserved for historical events. The hate groups who have usurped the usage of the battle flag really have no right to it. The biggest problem with the misuse of these flags is that the Supreme Court has already allowed this as a form of freedom of expression along side the flag of Nazi Germany and the wearing of the swastika arm-band in public.|`|TBNaPkl6aa	Here's my take on what the root of this debate is: many say the Confederate flag is a symbol of southern heritage, but no one wants to explain specifically what that heritage is.  That heritage, around the time the flag was created, was a heritage that included slavery and racism, and southerners happened to be honest enough to defend that.  (I say "honest enough" because most Northerners were certainly racist too, and very few people by the time of the Civil War approved of unconditional emancipation of slaves).  That's just one reason the flag has become involved in a racial issue.|`|VCIZJQCJaa	fantastic controversial question.  the safe  pro argument for today's society is that  the flag a relic of the past,no reason to celebrate it..when the south surrendered their confederate flag to the north union in 1865,militarily it meant never to fly this flag on usa soil again.later the 13 and 14th amendments were ratified.but during the  civil war the fact that only 350,000 out of 5 million whites wanted slaves.on the other side of the argument which weighs heavier scales. the Confederate flag represents the people their land their government ,ideas,heritage and they should be proud and allowed to display that.how many soldiers came home alive from the civil war carrying the Confederate flag so proudly..?? it also  representative of ancestrally historic roots with blacks and whites..and for the british population who settled in the south. now from a british point of view the stars and stripes represents many more years of treason,slavery and sedition. and still denotes prejudice all over this nation,not just the south)remember  witch hunts.look after the revolution war.ethnic cleansing,was what the stars and stripes stood for not liberty...look at all the modern wars, lives taken,crimes,continued prejudice against native american,chinese,muslims,africans the irish,italians,scots,south americans, brits,german's canadians etc.even when they are native  american born. the corrupt politicians ruining this country.so why isn't the stars and stripes more of an issue???????????|`|0xfVyxxIaa	I'm not American (so feel free to ignore my opinion) but I see no reason why the 'Stars and bars' and Beauregard's battle flag should be somehow erased from history for some shallow piece of feel-good political correctness.    Whether you see it as part of America's heritage or a symbol of racial oppression, erasing it from history amounts to faschist censorship in my eyes.

On top of that its probably advisable that you learn to draw basic figures and shapes to help storyboard your ideas, these little cards often help get across your ideas but youll need to be articulate well enough with your descriptions to convey your vision through words also. On top of these skills youll need some hardware, a relatively good quality hand held camera is a good start and studying books on film and like someone else suggests - watching DVD extras on films (behind the scenes/ Making off featurettes) give a great insight into how to put shots together like the pros. Be aware that lighting is a huge part of early handlheld directing work and that even a cheap camera shot can look 1000 times better when your scene is well lit. Besides this just really start thinking about how to lay out shots, even try going around putting up your hands in the classic letter box shape (forefinger of right hand touching thumb of left hand and vice versa) to see what your frame would limit a scene to. I hope this helps ;)|`|QPr6XYXUaa	start by making videos...film your friends.  Also, there are  camps for that kind of stuff. Check into it!   Good luck
iNXqiDIYaa	i found this in a blog    "Fhweet! I just discovered that Popular has opened a huge (by Penang standard) bookstore on the 3rd floor of Gurney Plaza. Gee, I had not ventured to that part for a while and just realise there is a spanking new store there.    Wow, there are plenty of books to see. So many books on photography (which I cant afford cos it is RM150 per book!). The rest are usual stuffs that Popular offers.     The Big Bookshop also has been renovated. TBB offers cheap books, those out of prints and older displayed books"    and the related search leads to this    "Best recipes, foods and travel  Chinese, Western, Malaysia best foods blog    Skip to Content Home   About me   Contact   Eating places   Foods   Privacy   Sitemap    Secondhand books shop  Nov 12th, 2006 by Lilian.       I took a walk down memory lane yesterday.?  When I was in my teens and twenties, this shop was located at sunny Macalister Road.?  I love hanging around the place and would visit the secondhand bookshop every weekend.?  Back then, they have a lot of imported magazines like Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and etc from the UK and USA.?  The exchange rate was mere USD1 equivalent to RM2.?  You can find almost any book there.?  From sleazy Swedish p0rns to Mad magazine to Harlequin romance.?  I had my dose of Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Cartland, Jackie Collins, Harold Robbins etc etc.?  Usually, the shop will sell you the book for say, RM10.?  Once you finished, you bring it back and claim RM5 from them.        Unfortunately, these stall owners were forced to move to the Chowrasta Market.?  As you can see, it is not an ideal place for a stroll because of the stench from the wet market downstairs. It is awfully hard to find a parking too.?  Anyway, after I started having children, I do not have that much of time to hang around the stall anymore.     However, the place where the bookshops are is not stuffy or smelly or anything like that.?  One can still hang around to browse through the books.?  So, if you are really into grabbing cheap books and comics, please do make a trip there.?  Chowrasta Market is along Penang Road.?  You can go up the bookshop from the flight of stairs.?  (Please ask the locals for direction.)"
s4WywJ8baa	Huh? Your question makes no sense. Professional photographers usually charge anywhere from $100 to $300 or more per 2 hour photo session.    Amateur photographers? Who knows how much they charge. They usually only have a camera, no studio and no equipment.    You might want to update your question with additional information so it makes sense.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Amateur means not gaining money for it....none, zero,zip, goose egg, nada!|`|D9x1QSgiaa	I consider myself to be a "Semi-Professional" but NOT an amateur. My photos are of professioanl quality and have been used in advertisement, promotional, and entertainment venues since 1976.     The "cheapest" shoot I will do for a client is $75. for a two hour shoot which is typically for HS Senior portraits. I will give them ONE 8x10 and FOUR 5x7 sized pics. If they wanted more, I will provide more at an additional fee. If the student is EXCEPTIONALLY handsome or beautiful (male or female) I MIGHT offer them an opportunity to get FREE pics and a FREE sitting fee IF they sign a Model's Release allowing me to use their images in advertising, such as the promotion of my business or some other use. I will also offer this to parents of chilcren if they are 100% adorable and make great photos.    For girls (or guys) looking to make a portfolio for modeling purposes I charge $150. for a three hour shoot, plus expenses, plus travel and plus photos. Maybe 5% of those I will shoot for FREE, once again, provided they are above average looking and sign a Model Release. I also get a "Finder's Fee" from a Modeling Agency located in Chicago if I provide them with photos of someone who they accept as one of their exclusive models. That happens about 4-5 times a year.|`|x5q0HM55aa	amateur? i guess he wont charge you much..but the quality is not guaranteed.    earn money to actually get worth looking shots

WZNaNvplaa	For Britain, perhaps, winning the Battle of the Atlantic was the turning point o the war. For the war as a whole, other events were of more import.    But to support the thesis. First, had Germany won that war, Britain could have faced an invasion, rather than having been the one planning to attack the mainland in the future(1944). Second, the winning of the battle of the Atlantic ensured that Britain could remain in contact with its allies and colonies. This provided supplies, manpower, and war material to keep them in the war. Third, it helped Great Britain strangle the Nazi supply lines from around the world. While Germany could draw on a lot of resources, certain ones, like oil, were in short supply in western Europe. By making sure that Germany could not import oil from other regions, it forced Germany to strike for the Caucuses, drawing military resources away from the Russian front further north, and to overextend the Wehrmacht.  To a minor degree, it also added to the morale of England, as first the German surface navy was reduced to impotence, then the submarine fleet systematically eradicated. After the early days of the war, when the Germans could brag about tonnage sunk, the English could promote each naval engagement and claim just retribution for each sailor or civilian lost earlier.|`|WvAwQmndaa	Yes I would agree with that judgement. It was a turning of the tide for Britain. They won the battle of the Atlantic, so research the battle, and include the facts leading up to, during and after. And why it was important for them to win it.     D-Day is important because the allied powers were fighting together to win the world war. stategic bombing really helped us to win the war by getting rid of their military bases, and other important things like factories that could help produce wartime materials for the enemy.|`|2d4d4d8f449f8266d3033948651354acaa	I would challenge the assertion that the battle of the Atlantic was the most important reason. Important but not most. The major turning point in WWII is Stalingrad 1942-3, the Eastern front from this point on is on the defensive for Germany and uses up the majority of the Germans resources.

2ucN3YXRaa	Salsa dancing actually differs somewhat from country to country and from city to city, so there are as many differences are tere are similarities. I would break things down into 4 major styles today. New York Style salsa, LA Style Salsa, Cuban Style Salsa and Colombian Style Salsa.    There are some basic characteristics that are shared by all salsa styles.  1) It is a partner dance where the man leads and the woman follows  2) The music has 4 beats per measure but the dancers only take steps on 3 of the beats pausing for one beat. This is often confusing for beginners. You could count it like step, step, step, pause or some people say "quick, quick, slow"  3) The dance includes both turn patterns as well as moments where the couple may separate and dance apart for a short time before retuning to dance together.  4) The hips of the dancers, both man and woman, are always moving.    US salsa styles share the trait that they are danced more or less straight backwards and forwards, i.e. the motion is in a straight line. This is called "in-the-slot" as if each couple has a slot on the dancefloor and they keep within that slot as they dance. One implication of this is that the dancers spin, especilaly the ladies do multiple spins and often double or triple turns.     Also both NY and LA style salsa use a lot of "shines". These are step combinations that the couples do when they split apart.    However, NY salsa is danced On2 whereas LA Salsa, and pretty much all other salsa as well, is danced on 1. New York dancers "break" on2  while everyone else "breaks" on1.    Here is a video of some  New York style dancers, note how they stay more or less inside the lines of where they are dancing on the carpet.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHx2ivwEF...    Also LA salsa is very flashy with a lot of acrobatic moves designed to impress the audience.  Here is a video of the Vasquez brothers who "invented" LA Style. Note the acrobatics and showiness of the dancing.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vbYn9iJ7...    Cuban salsa like LA breaks on 1 or even sometimes 3, but the direction of motion is in a circle. The couple moves around and axis thta is between them or sometimes the man becomes the axis. Instead of spins, turns in Cuban dancing are usually 180 degress with the man and woman switching places. Cuabns don't do acrobatic moves but rather enjoy complex, tangly moves that require rotation to get untangled again. Cuban style salsa is actually called Casino.    Instead of doing "shines" Cuban style dancers will switch to "despelote" and "tembleque" when they split apart. They may also add steps from afr-cuban rumba and afro-cuban religious dances.    Here are some people dancing casino at a club in Paris. Note the circular motion, tangly moves and the parts where they separate and dance afro-cuban rumba rather than doing shines.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-30RzT2wn...    Finally Colombian salsa is danced on1 but has unique footwork that comes from boogaloo. This style of salsa originated in Cali, Colombia and most Colombians actually dance somethnig closer to Cuban style salsa but with fewer moves. However, people are starting to teach Cali style salsa as "Colombina style salsa" so it will probably continue to gain a share of the market.  Cali style salsa at a club in Colombia. They seem to have picked up some of the LA moves as well.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEuhOR_Ar...    Cubans also dance a variation of salsa called Rueda de Casino, which means "Casino wheel" since it is casino moves that are dnaced in a circle by a group of 2 or more couples. Ruedas "wheeles" form spontaneously at clubs and parties but have also become an are for competitions. One important aspect of Rueda is that it is not a planned choreography. There is one leader who calls out moves and everyone performs the moves in unison. So anyone who knows the names of hte moves can join in, but you never know what moves will be called or in what order. And sometimes the leader will try to trick the dancers into messing up.  Here is a group performing in a rueda de casino contest on Cuban TV  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrl1uAGw8...

This painting shows the French frigate "Medusa" which crashed into a reef on July 2, 1816 off the west coast of Africa.  The captain and officers of the "Medusa" took all six lifeboats for themselves and selected passengers, leaving the other 149 crew and passengers on a wooden raft; the captain then cut the raft loose from the lifeboat.    After thirteen days aboard the raft, only 15 people survived to report tales of starvation and cannibalism.  When it was revealed that the captain had received his job due to political patronage rather than merit and skill, Gericault painted "Medusa" to memorialize this social injustice.      "Raft of the Medusa" is an oil on canvas, 1819, measures 16' x 23'6", and is at the Louvre.

You should really know how to RUN a business before you think about starting a business.    2.  You should know something about the greeting card business before jumping in and starting your own.  (it is clear from your questions that you don't.    If you don't know the first thing about MARKETING your product, your venture is doomed to failure.  Any advice you get from Yahoo Answers is bound to be iffy, and may not apply in the various stages of the marketplace.    What you NEED is a publisher for your line of greeting card designs.  With a publisher, you only need to worry about the creative end of the business while the publisher takes all the risks. (I worry about this, for your sake because if you need a template, and don't know that greeting cards come in a VARIETY of sizes and formats, then you really aren't in a position to be a card designer, no matter how skillful a photographer you are)    I suggest you contact a greeting card company, find out who the art director is and ask THEM about their design submission guidelines.  Send them a SASE (usually a  10 business size envelope) and then read these guidelines carefully.  NOTHING gets tossed into the trash bin faster than submissions from people who can't follow simple directions.    If you insist on going it on your own, be prepared for a lot of obstacles.  You will have to be your own sales staff, so that means research and legwork to find out who to contact to get your product into stores.  Have a contract ready.  You can't expect to just drop off a case of cards on a merchant and just aske them to track the money for you.  If you don't know how to draw up a contract, then this is another reason to reconsider starting your own business.    Do you know how to do your own bookkeeping?  File for taxes?  Deduct business expenses?  What kind of business insurance do you expect to carry?  Etc.  Etc.    "Intimidation" is only the FIRST of the uncertainties of running a business.    Good luck.

1XmmMnPEaa	Bad news is that unless your acting is directly relevant for a role it wont mean anything for an employer - all you will bring to the party compared to an 18-23 y/o is "life" experience and probably higher salary requirements - you have to ask why an employer would consider you and your skills over a teenager...  As you will be competing against new grads you are best taking a "sideways" approach i.e. don't approach the job market like an 18 - 23 year old would.  Leverage any contacts you have made as this is the best way of getting "in" to an industry or organisation    If you can support yourself your best bet is to try and get some temp work in the industry and use your more mature, experienced manner to make an impact and hope to get taken on and developed.    Create a couple of versions of your CV and try and explain your skills, thinking if you were recruiting, what would you look for. Talk in terms of successes and how that has been an advantage for an organisation - don't just list skills, expand on them and illustrate how they have benefited organisations before. Different versions are to appeal to different recruiters - if you are a sales manager, one might focus on sales, the other on management. Most recruiters use programs that find CVs like Google does - mention something (i.e.sales) more often and you will be ranked higher up the search.  put your CVs out on the various job boards such as Monster, Fish4, Totaljobs etc and any industry specific ones you know about.    Lastly they keep advertsing for teachers, why not retrain for that?

You have good practicing habits and dedication, which will take you far     - the best teachers, the best instruments, the best music to listen to - none of that makes any difference without the willingness to practice and desire to play - and you already have that!     That being said, my best tip to you is to get help/mentoring/lessons - whatever you can do, from the best players and/or teachers you can find, because there is so much about the violin that isn't intuitive     - proper bow hold, bowing technique, bow pressure, distance of bow from bridge, position of the wrist, how the fingers arch on the fret board, how to hold up the violin, best shoulder rest for you...  I could go on and on.      Here's something else:  Contrary to popular opinion, practice does NOT make perfect.  Instead, PERFECT practice makes perfect.     It is quite easy to practice things that are incorrect that become ingrained bad habits that will have to be undone later if you continue to play the violin.     This is where really good, regular help and feedback (in the form of lessons, whatever you can get) will make all the difference for you.  Good lessons with good practice habits will make all the difference for you.    It IS worth doing - keep up the good work!|`|rPHGTyK2aa	get a recording of what you are playing.  listen to it.  a lot.  then you will have the (hopefully correct) rhythms and sounds in your head.    and keep practicing.  but i recommend playing for 20-30 minutes. then a 10 minute break. then another 20-30 minutes.  this will help keep good posture and help prevent moving into bad posture because of fatigue.  this also will reduce the risk of injury.  (yes. i said injury.  repetitvie motion injuries are common when a person suddenly launches into an activity they don't do normally (or didn't do normally). and continues for extended amounts of time)
cb25af74395068791628bac78a1921f0aa	I would guess your main concern would be keeping the rest of your sketchbook clean and dry while you're working with the cover. The best thing to do would be to wrap the paper in a plastic back or cellophane to keep it safe.    Clorox makes a "Bleach Pen" that many people use on fabric for creative purposes; it's really easy to draw clean lines with, just like you would with a Sharpie or marker.    Other things you could do:  - Spray bottle to create splatter effects  - Reservoir brush that hold fluid in the handle, to do calligraphy, painterly drawings.  - Pour bleach directly on the fabric for abstract shapes  - Mix bleach with water to create varying levels of "bleached-ness", so it's not as strong    I think the only tricky thing is when it's dry, your sketchbook is going to smell strongly of bleach.   You might treat the fabric separately (if it's possible) wash it, and then apply it to the cover.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Without knowing the fabric I can't be specific. You may want to get a piece of something similar to see how detailed you can be. If you are just going for a tie dye effect, some bleach water solution (1/2 & 1/2) will work with Q tips. Have fun.

I'm sorry for you.|`|fOZPJhoPaa	Well if you are still alive to read this answer I would not take too much notice, I know that's easy for me to say but hey, we all have to die at some point that's' the conclusion to our lives, if you are going to die then at least you know how and when which is much more than most people do, apart from Cyclops, of course oh and suicide bombers. Anyway I'm rambling and you may not have time to read all of this, unless it's true that you can still see for a fraction of time after you have been decapitated and always assuming that your head is still in a position to see the screen. Basically at the end of the day if you spend what could be the last day of your life worrying about loosing your head instead of living, then personally I think you are wasting your last day on this mortal coil.

B0GujA9Aaa	I agree with Elizabeth.    The Finch family were revolutionary; they saw people for who they were not because of their skin color.     During the trial Atticus Finch (the lawyer) was able to figure out what had really happened to Mayella Ewell.  He was able to get to the bottom of the hysteria and found out that Tom Robinson (the black man) had done nothing wrong. Mayella's father (Bob Ewell) had beat and violated her in a drunken rage.    Mayella was just lying to protect her father and because she believed that black people were lower than white people.|`|DvToP5h7aa	To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee    Study Guides:    http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/h...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/    http://www.homework-online.com/tkamb/ind...    http://www.bellmore-merrick.k12.ny.us/mo...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...|`|AA10798839	By putting story mostly in eyes' of children they reflect the place thus define the period. It might be fun to have Mockingbird fly to Washington and land in a tree in the Rose Garden. You could call it The More Things Change The More They Remain The Same. Use two black children to describe how their dad isn't lifting poor up but tinkling down on then just like two children watched many year ago. The connection is using technique of showing world through eyes of  children without the spin.|`|ZLJN8VXOaa	They definitely modified it. The Finch Family didn't put up with the racial stereotypes presented in early 1900's Alabama, they broke the barriers down.

SZdVYrSSaa	Dramatic monologues...    The classic tortured writer is usually very much a cynic. You want to use a very dark look at life.     Some people you may want to look up, read a few lines of Edgar Allen Poe, no one owned "tortured" like the raven himself. Also take a look at August Strindberg, a very influential dark writer. There is actually a very humorous animated web comic called "Strindberg & Helium" that portrays him nicely. As well, you'll probably need an ample amount of quietly spoken interior thoughts. Maybe think about taking a section where he contemplates something using just bits of the sentence as if the writer was only vocalizing... For example an excerpt (this is published, by the way)    "And then she looked to me, so I simply told her...but no... I mean... I believe it was the poisoned look on her face that...  so I wasn't wrong, was...I mean...I... I mean, I can't... because if there was someone to be blamed it was her... she was a wretched, foul, stinking... and I am only an innocent man, and observer, AN OBSERVER who cannot change that which he... I mean to say... well, ...THE ACT OF OBSERVATION IS NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS THE CATALYST FOR A VICTIM YOU KNOW... AND THIS I KNOW... yes, well of course"    You see how he carries out the second half of the conversation on his own? This is excellent. If you are looking for more modern examples, watch the film 'Secret Window' starring Johnny Depp, he plays perfect neurotic writer. Another idea is to listen to someone speaking on the phone, preferably a stranger, and only pay attention to what they are saying and how they say it. Close your eyes and pretend they are speaking aloud to themselves.    Finally, you could always stick with time. There is nothing more tortured about writers, than those who have to meet a deadline, or who desire nothing more than to finish their novel, and yet find themselves incurably blocked from their own creativity.     One of my best writing teachers of all time, former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins once said that great dramatic writing is made up of 10% Inspiration, 20% Procrastination, and 70% Good Tea. As if to say, there is nothing one can do to sound more like a good writer, than to sit alone and slowly become caffeinated. In this quote, I leave you to your work.     Best of luck, and enjoy.|`|ZLJN8VXOaa	Read some Edgar Allen Poe, And some Chuck Palahniuk. They're pretty tortured, i guess.    and they all do good ramblings|`|SOt4ia4paa	How I do it -I am sort of a tortured writer so I do it all the time- is I use a lot of high vocabulary that sounds gloomy or depressing. If you are sort of a depressed person then just listen to your heart and words will be flying across the page in no time! And if you are a regular happy person then use a thesaurus and look up some words that describe are along the lines of slow, sad, mad, sunken  Ramblings are more along the lines of a soliloquy which is basically a talk with yourself about the awful things you've done or of the things that you wish could happen to you. (By the way, this is a great example! Notice how I'm not just listing things, I am really thinking of good vocabulary and good ways to form the paragraphs) Normally, when I write a soliloquy, I make the character look up at the sky a lot and perhaps shed a reluctant tear.    I hope this helps! I hope you get a good grade on the paper!    |`|WZa6GhS3aa	Well a example of a story im doing    I saw the slaughter the massacre of many virtous victims i only knew that it could be me that they where waiting for next .Days and nights passed as i layed awake in bed well what i called bed a stinging sharp chilling floor of a old shack the same shack that i hid waiting for my family the first time. There was nights when i expected them to enter to walk through the door and smile to tell me to wake up , in my heart i knew this was all imagination i knew they where gone forever.  also another part of my story     i watched my mother and family die right infront of my eyes it was unbearable i did all i could i was the only one there how could i save them it was up to me to save my whole family? my mother stopped breathing still from this day i believed it to be my fault whilst the guns where blazing and dad had passed out hours before mum i knew he had to be dead he couldn't of survived the guns and torture of the carsonville city raids and as for my little sister i did not find her i did not know if she was dead or alive i needed to know as tears dripped from my eye i had to believe she was alive i had to have some hope something to believe in.

Inkheart is allabout bks, I mean what HAPPENS in it is about bks, their love.  Is about a girl meggie, who has a past she doesn't know about. Once when she was 3, her dad was reading aloud 2 her mom ( a bk named Inkheart, the bk Inkheart is the central part of the bk,dont confuse this with the ACTUAL bk written by Cornelia Funke), he accidentally read 3 characters (Capricorn [a tyrannt], Basta [his devoted servant], and Dustfinger [a fireater, & Capricorn's enemy]).    After he read them out, 2 of her dad's cats and her mom went INTO the bk, 2 replace the 3 characters that came out.  and for years, Dustfinger, who misses his home, begs Mo (Meggie's dad) 2 read him BACK into the bk, but Mo can't coz he doesn't know how to.  Then they go into hiding 2 meggie's Aunt Elinor ( I just luv that character! [cuz she's bk crazy])  There, Mo is captured by Capricorn (who's in luv w/ this world, and has makde quite a place here)    Capricorn has been trying 2 burn and destroy every copy of Inkheart, so that no one can send him back, except for one, his personal copy.    He wants Mo 2 read other ppl from the story into the real world, and then they escape....read on....(I mean get the bk)    Inkheart is a wonderful bk, a mixture of comedy, adventure, romance (teeny bit), suspence, secrets..  U hve GOT  2 read it.  But I dont know ne  thing about the other fantasies u mentioned..|`|cYW1bWi7aa	they are all amazing!!!!  eoin colfer is a great author!  inkheart has a great storyline!  and i just love the characters in bartimeus!|`|oa1YH5l7aa	Inkheart is worth cutting off your left earlobe for.

BYdjgGVDaa	A person is so much more than flesh and bones.    A person is a product of a human beings total life experiences, from birth to whatever stage in their life they have reached.  Every influence, good or bad, every thought, word, and deed make up a person. Love and compassion, or the lack thereof, all play in to the composition of a person.  Life chances, taken or overlooked, help determine the outcome of your person-hood.

QPr6XYXUaa	okay, sounds like your pointe shoes are not broken in. It can take weeks to break them in, depending on how much you work in them. You can't dance in them until they are broken in.  Work on rolling up through the shoes one at a time as much as you can. Also, try walking around in them in demi pointe.  Good luck.|`|8S2icURfaa	Before you got your pointe shoes you should have had your ballet instructor check your feet out to make sure you are ready!|`|AA10496780	30 years ago, my only at home exercise was the railing of the back yard's chain link fence and inside when it was too cold outside was the railing for the stairs to the second floor. The stairs was the best tool. I had very skinny legs and it was hard but I learned to balance straight and walk up & down the steps on my toes in pointe. I was allowed to put a sofa cushion at the bottom of the steps in case of falling which did happen a few times.|`|3BzVOdzUaa	Hi, sorry to hear you are having trouble. It sounds maybe like your ankles are not strong enough yet. I'd do lots of demi point exercises. Basically do all your pointe exercises in your soft point shoes, such as raising a lowering in all 5 positions, not going up on to full pointe. But really concentrate on stretching your ankles keep pointing your toes as strongly as you can dn do it about 20 times each go. A little like the old 'god toes, naughty toes' exercise, that should help strengthen the ankle. I wouldn't recommend using your points at home unsupervised when you are new as you can do a lot of damage. Also make sure you ribbons are sown on right, at an angle, just to the front of your ankles and tie them correctly. That will Support your ankles. If it is painful, you can get 'Ouch pouches' off the internet, which are a gel cover for your toes, they work very well better than the sheep wool normal covers.   The back of your shoes will soon loosen up and mould to your foot arch with use. Once they get floppy it is time for a new pair.    Hope I helped a bit.|`|00f9b13066000aa39eb7b7036e571513aa	your shoes need breaking in...after wearing them for class bend the soles where you need them to 'break' and you can get  foot strengthening materials for discount dance|`|WoxHi03eaa	I had exactly the same problem when I started en Pointe.     You need to break in your shoes, and then you'll feel more comfortable in them -- it will be easier to get en Pointe.     I MUST recommend the videos by Lisa Howell on YouTube, they helped me sooo much. Also, visit TheBalletBlog.com, which Lisa owns, you can pick up handy hints and tips for your ballet. There are also excercises that help you develop the muscles you need for Pointe.     Enjoy your dancing!|`|swg3BhLXaa	Because your shoes are new, they will be tough for a while. It takes a few weeks sometimes for the shoe to start softening up and molding to your foot. There are different techniques for "breaking in" your pointe shoes to make them more comfortable. Ask your teacher, or research on the site for the company that makes the shoe, to make sure that you don't damage your shoes. Once the shank starts to soften, it will become easier to roll through demi-pointe.    Don't get discouraged. As you continue to work at the barre in class, your feet will get stronger and you will begin to find it easier to go up on pointe.    Continue to do releves to strengthen your feet (or begin, if you're not already doing this).     Here's a good calf work-out:  1) 32 releves with both feet turned out  2) 32 releves with both feet in parallel  3) 32 releves with both feet turned in  4) 32 releves with one foot in cou de pie (then do the other foot)  5) 32 releves with one foot in passe (then do the other foot)    *Do these without holding on to anything. And be sure to go all the way up in releve.   *Don't allow your heel to just drop back to the floor. Come down slowly in a controlled way. "Fast up, slow down."  *Stretch your calves and your achilles tendons after you're done.    Your calves will be screaming by the time you're finished!! But, you use these every second you're en pointe, so continue to strengthen them. If after all 5 steps you find it to be too easy, increase your reps to 40.    ALSO ...  If you have a theraband (or any type of strong elastic), you can do this exercise to help strengthen your ankles and toes:  1) Sit on a flat surface and point the foot you are going to work.   2)Loop the band under your foot (by pushing your toes through the center) and pull the ends towards you. Make sure that your toe nails are short so that you don't rip the band. (It should look like your foot is in a sling).  3) Write each letter of the alphabet with your toes (upper and lower case).   4) Do this 2-3 time for each foot, alternating feet.     *Be careful not to stress your ankles. If it starts to hurt or if your feet feel really tired, don't do as many repetitions.    Give yourself time. Be diligent and don't try anything too risky. The last thing you want it to sprain (or break) your ankle trying to do a trick. The recovery time stinks and then you'll only end up behind everyone else.    Happy dancing!
gA2wmyIyaa	Well it all depends if ur god at memerizing maybe somthing like that are you a singer? an actor ar you a comedian its all what YOU are YOUR talent!! Have fun :D|`|mizPdbuAaa	Well, with comedy, either you're born with a funny bone or you're not. If you weren't then to develop a sense of comedy requires imagination, practice and study. If you're looking for humour, and how its formed through verbal and physical means, then I would suggest a few Brit comedies, Monty Python Life of Brian and Blackadder II - IV, as they contain a great deal of wit.    As for anything else, just keep trolling along until you find something that is out-of-the-ordinary and can be performed on-stage, then focus on that. If it doesn't come naturally, don't give up, just focus on it.
AA12172001	Sounds good so far, but try to make the words have a slight rhyme to emphasise the pain conveyed in the poem.|`|PZYNdUtXaa	yes I think so. Go for it.    for some reason I cannot explain I would like the last two lines to be together on one line!  But I am sure you feel differently because you are the creator and you must do what feels right to you.    the only thing to think about is, as you continue with this poem do you want to have further verses with a similar structure in terms of line length - if so you have quite a specific one above.  Having said that I wouldn't change that structure much as it works with the ideas you are writing about.|`|GpO17WZ4aa	I have a title for the poem     Tomarrow|`|azEAN8JBaa	Yeah really dark and meaningful.

Even the church violated that rule, the borrowed from the Jews with interest due, and probably loaned to some with interest to be due.      The Jews would have had a monopoly on the banking system because the Usury ban did not apply to them.      All of this went to hell in a handbasket with Martin Luther who cancelled the usury rule and allowed lending for interest due.  That sped up the wheels toward capitalism which went into full bloom with the Dutch Tulip trade.|`|AA10813012	In many kingdoms in the Middle Ages, Jews did have a monopoly on banking due to the church's ban on Christians lending. Jews were great patsies for noblemen because they could borrow up to the hilt and then just dissolve the loan and exile or outright kill the jewish lenders when it became convenient. Who were they going to appeal to? The Pope?  But the Medici family wanted in on the action during the Renaissance, when the merchant princes (rich commoners) were coming up and needed loans. The Medici planted family members in the Catholic Hierarchy that gave them an exemption from the usury ban. The Medici made out like bandits.|`|AA11942204	The church's ban on lending money at interest was easily evaded. Typically a lender would "give" money to the borrower and then it would be repaid with a penalty for lateness that was interest in all but name.
TvDubaNxaa	I would go for the first it would work well in an average home, in a small space etc. The second is unique but would be good if you have a modern style or parisian decor. The second would be good if i had a nicer frame--as in not one from ikea. to make a statement and add to the appearance of your space buy the second and find a different frame, i'd go for guilt. If re framing is not an option go for number one because it can stand alone and would look better with a simple frame or no frame at all.|`|LydL7EN6aa	i like the first one better, its seems more calm and relaxing

He wasn't imprisoned for murder, though, but for being a member of the Petrashevsky Circle.    from Shmoop/Crime and Punishment|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Dostoevsky was very concerned about the times he lived in.  Russia in the late 19th century was in dire straits indeed.  The tsars had initiated reforms in the justice system, the class system was being disrupted, and many Russian intellectuals were embracing Western ideas.  Marx and the ideas of socialsim heavily influenced a new breed of young thinkers in Russia at the time, and Dostoevsky was keenly aware of that influence.  I can't think of a Dostoevsky novel that doesn't feature a character that could be coined Marxist: Raskolnikov's friend in Crime and Punishment, to Ivan in The Brothers Karamazov, the secret society in Demons, and the sick boy in The Idiot.  All these characters represent the encroachment of Marxist principles into Russian life.  Dostoevsky recognized this trend and incorporated it into his literature.  He anticipated a cultural revolution in Russia, one we would see in the early 20th Century with Lenin and his Bolshevik Revolution.
