It's important to know exactly what the essay title is asking us to do. First look at this essay statement and the four questions that follow it. How will the initial verbs influence your essay?<br>  <br>  'China today is totally different from the country that it was in 1970.'<br>  <br>  Justify this statement. <br>  Evaluate this statement. <br>  Outline the ways in which China has changed. <br>  Diagnose the main causes of change in China. <br>  Although the content of all four essays will overlap, there will be significant differences. An essay asking you to justify a statement will be asking you to find evidence to support the statement.<br>  <br>  An essay asking you to evaluate a statement will want you to provide arguments and evidence for and against the statement.<br>  <br>  An essay title that asks you to outline events, reasons or causes will want you to show that you have a good grasp of what actually happened, and why.<br>  <br>  An essay asking you to diagnose changes or the causes of change will seek to find out if you have a clear understanding of what occurred, and in particular, the causes and effects of different events.<br>  <br>  There are a number of verbs that often appear in essay titles; the list of verbs below are particularly common:<br>  <br>  Analyse: investigate, consider in detail <br>  Compare: look at the similarities and differences <br>  Contrast: consider the differences between two things or ideas <br>  Criticise: outline the theory or situation and then state how you approve or disapprove; you can bring in other's views too perhaps to support your argument <br>  Define: state clearly and logically the meaning of a word or phrase <br>  Delineate: give a broad outline of an idea or theory without going into great detail <br>  Describe: give an account of events, or experiments, findings or theories etc. <br>  Differentiate: distinguish between two events or theories <br>  Enumerate: list down the main points, features, factors <br>  Evaluate: outline the theory or main ideas and then state how you approve or disapprove; you can bring in other's views <br>  Examine: look into a theory, a period of history, experimental results etc. in detail <br>  Explain: give reasons how or why something happened and provide an interpretation <br>  Explore: examine a theory or event (or series of events) very thoroughly, providing an explanation <br>  Illustrate: use examples to justify your argument <br>  Interpret: describe a series of events and provide an explanation <br>  Justify: give reasons/evidence in support for your argument <br>  Outline: cover the main points briefly; do not go into detail <br>  Relate: show how things are related to each other and in what ways they are similar or different <br>  Review: give an account that includes the main points but not necessarily all the detail; give differing points of view <br>  State: present a theory or set of beliefs in a clear way <br>  Summarise: cover all of the main points but not all of the detail. <br>  Trace: follow the stages in the development of a theory or of historical events from the past <br>  <br>  i wish it helps this is all i can find!!|`|TQfVWzt5aa	Courage can move mountains.
73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Well, I'm not sure if I can help you much with your point about restorative justice, but I have many good reasons to be against capital punishment:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."<br>  <br>  6. Whether you’re a hardened criminal or a government representing the people, killing another human being is wrong.  “He did it first” is not a valid excuse.<br>  <br>  If you haven't seen the movie Dead Man Walking (Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn), you should - it is excellent.  There was a line in there, I can't remember the exact words, but something along the lines of "a person's life is worth more than their worst deed."<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.  Good luck on your essay!|`|NnpMaOTnaa	you could look at human rights.<br>  you could look at cases where the person they killed was actually innocent.<br>  religious factors<br>  cultural impact.<br>  be sure to state your key points in the hypothesis|`|bf5cDEyZaa	In certain cases, I fully support capital punishment. Reconciliation, restoration etc is not possible, since the murder victim cannot be brought back to life.<br>  <br>  My biggest concern regarding capital punishment is our flawed justice system. Human error in the investigation process, bureaucratic/political agendas, intentional set-ups etc can still send an innocent man to death row.

All you really have to do is substitute the second equation into the first equation. The second equation is already telling you what x is, so you put that for the value of x in the first equation. It's like if the second equation is x=3; you would put 3 for x in the first equation to figure out y.<br>  <br>  B. That is a bit tricky, since it does have three variables. Play around with it, I'm really not sure.<br>  <br>  C, Here, you have to look at the second equation and figure out a way to make it into an x=. So just add 3y to both sides to get x by itself. Then do the thing that I described in A.<br>  <br>  D. See C. Also, if you want to make -x into +x (or x), just multiply both sides by -1.<br>  <br>  E, F, G. See C.

e6923297a9e9b6a1da8be3748d9facb9aa	I think this is the best review ---<br>  <br>  Long time ago there weren't such things as computer games, movies, TV shows or even comic books. So, young boys and other people yearning to experience strange new worlds of imagination had to rely on the written word. One of the people who delivered those worlds was Jules Verne, 19th Century French novelist who is often regarded as the father of science fiction genre. There were, of course, authors who had used elements of science fiction in their works before, but Verne is the first one whose complete opus is associated with that particular genre. On the other hand, Verne's novels, although definitely belonging to the genre, are in their nature adventure stories, and thus responsible for future misconception of science fiction as nothing more than worthless juvenile escapism. Escapist or not, Verne's work provides entertainment to its reader, and even today we are still fascinated with his technological prophecies, although many of them became obsolete with the passage of time. The best known Verne's novel and one of the classics of the adventure literature is 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, mother of all underwater exploration novels. Its popularity among the readers was tremendous, but the 20th Century filmmakers were rather reluctant to adapt it to the big screen, mostly due to the huge technical problems associated with the production. Some of those problems were solved in 1954 when Disney produced its version, directed by Richard Fleischer, one of the very first films shot with the use cinemascope technology.<br>  <br>  The plot begins in 1868 when numerous ships are rammed and sank by huge and unknown object. Surviving sailors bring stories about sea monster, creating hysteria in the world's ports. Professor Arronax (played by Paul Lukas), French marine scholar visiting San Francisco, is asked by US government to join expedition that should investigate the phenomenon. Arronax boards US Navy vessel, together with his trusted servant and apprentice Conceille (played by Peter Lorre) and Ned Land (played by Kirk Douglas), cocky expert harpoonist. The expedition spends many months in fruitless search, until it finally encounters the sea monster in violent collision. Arronax, Conseille and Land are thrown overboard and after a while they stumble on the object of their search. To their great surprise, they realise that the "sea monster" is actually man-made submarine. Its crew, led by mysterious Captain Nemo (played by James Mason) take them as prisoners. For the next few months they would experience numerous adventures and witness many wonders of the underwater world. In the same time, while Arronax tries to reason with Nemo and convince him that he should share his discoveries with the rest of the world, Land plots escape.<br>  <br>  20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA is embodiment of Disney at his best - family entertainment that superbly uses brand-new wonders of film technology. Special effects, combined with the underwater photography, are still impressive after almost four decades, and the "Oscar" award for them is well deserved, especially after we take into account the use of brand new cinemascope technology. Production design of "Nautilus" was also very good, both original and faithful to Verne's vision. The result is a film that should be viewed as a very good adaptation of the science fiction classic, in many ways comparable to the adaptation of H.G. Wells' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, produced one year earlier.<br>  <br>  Of course, technical innovation and visual splendour isn't enough for a movie to be successful. Script by Earl Felton took some liberties with the original text, which is quite understandable. Some of the situations are quite recognisable from the novel; on the other hand, Felton spiced up the characters and, in some way, improved Verne's material. The biggest difference is the moral ambiguity; Nemo, played by James Mason, is portrayed as genius whose disgust with civilisation and conventional morality reaches almost pathological levels, while, in the same time, deeply personal and quite understandable causes of such disgust provide strong emotional impact, making that character very alive, believable and almost sympathetic. Land, enthusiastically played by Kirk Douglas in his prime, is portrayed as a "normal" and even extremely likeable man, but, on the other hand, his actions portray him as not very bright. Paul Lukas as narrator is shadowed by those two, same as Peter Lorre's Conseille, rather unsuccessful and almost pathetic attempt of comic relief.<br>  <br>  Since the film was targeted towards family audiences, some of the darker and more adult aspects of the story were compensated with rather unnecessary plot additions intended to lighten up the mood of the film. First we see Kirk Douglas doing the song number in the beginning, and, later, we have a pet seal as much more successful comic relief. Those elements give some charm to the film, but in the same time they reduce film

NKdJeUVoaa	There are two key things to remember for this set of problems:<br>  <br>  1. Multiplication takes precedence over addition: in all four examples, multiply the fraction times the integer before subtracting by two.<br>  2. When adding or subtracting fractions, all fractions must have the same common denominator: Notice that before subtracting two from the "x/3" fraction on the right, I wrote 2 as 6/3. Once you've done that, just subtract the numbers in the numerator.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are the solutions:<br>  <br>  1/3 * 1 - 2 = (1/3 * 1) - 2 = 1/3 - 2 = 1/3 - 6/3 = (1 - 6)/3 = -5/3<br>  or "negative one and two thirds"<br>  <br>  1/3 * 2 - 2 = (1 * 2)/3 - 2 = 2/3 - 2 = 2/3 - 6/3 = (2 - 6)/3 = -4/3<br>  or "negative one and one third'<br>  <br>  1/3 * 3 - 2 = (1 * 3)/3 - 2 = 3/3 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1<br>  <br>  1/3 * 4 - 2 = (1 * 4)/3 - 2 = 4/3 - 2 = 4/3 - 6/3 = (4 - 6)/3 = -2/3|`|mqcnt6kiaa	1/3*1-2:<br>  <br>  first 1/3*1=1/3<br>  <br>  then you have 1/3-2=(1-3*2)/3= -5/3<br>  <br>  or you can change 2 to 6/3 and then 1/3-6/3= -5/3.  please try it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1/3*2-2  =  2/3-2  =  2/3-6/3  = -4/3<br>  <br>  1/3*3-2  =  3/3-2  =  1-2  =   -1<br>  <br>  1/3*4-2  =  4/3-2  =  4/3-6/3  = -2/3|`|OmsYxRDDaa	okay, never change the denomenator when multplying!!!  just multiply straight across.  Here's an example:<br>  1/3*1/2= 1/6<br>  because 1*1 is 1 and 2*3 is 6.  if they give you a whole number and a fraction to multiply, then put a 1 under the whole number and do the same thing.  Example:<br>  1/2*4                                   you do: 1/2 * 4/1 which equals 4/2 and then you simplify or whatever its called which makes it 2.  When you add or subtract fractions always change the denomenator if it's different.  If you want to divide then just flip the second fraction and multiply. Example:<br>  1/2 divided by 4/3.................it turns to be 1/2 * 3/4....then just multiply straight across.

PEMDAS<br>  Parenthesis | Exponents | Multiplication | Division | Addition | Subtraction.<br>  <br>  Rewrite the problem, for example the first one:<br>  <br>  1/3 x 1 - 2<br>  You have to do the parenthesis first since you dont have any exponents in this problem.<br>  <br>  Rewrite:<br>  (1/3 x 1/1) - (2/1)<br>  <br>  Now multiply the parenthesis<br>  <br>  (1/3) x 1 = 1/3<br>  <br>  Now following the operations you have subtration left.<br>  So;<br>  (1/3) - 2<br>  <br>  Now, when dealing with fractions you cannot just add or subtract. You have to have a common denominator.<br>  For example:<br>  <br>  1/3 - 2/1 does not equal (-1/2)<br>  <br>  To find a common denominator:<br>  <br>  you have a 3 and a 1 for your denominators and you want them to be the same. It cannot be 1 because 3 cannot be decreased to a lower number so that leaves you with 1.<br>  <br>  1 can be multiplied to get a 3.<br>  How? well, in this case its easy 1 x 3 gives you 3.<br>  <br>  so:<br>  <br>  (1/3) - ((2/1)x3)<br>  2x 3= 6<br>  1x 3= 3<br>  <br>  so (1/3) - (6/3)<br>  <br>  Now you have a common denominator and therefore you can subtract these fractions:<br>  <br>  1-6 = -3<br>  You dont subtract the denominator, when you have the same denominator you just use that number so in this case its 3.<br>  <br>  -5/3 is your answer.<br>  <br>  I know this seems complicated but i just went step by step and thats why its longer.

aTmu4WEbaa	You can say that Technology has created expedients for us in the way we communicate data and knowledge, which makes learning easier (e.g. wikipedia, text messaging)<br>  <br>  However, Technology has also made us less physically connected to one another. text messages, phone calls, and emails all lack physical contact, and thus lack true social interaction. It makes us more distant and less willing to bond with other people.<br>  <br>  Television has made data easier to receive (watching the news or a drama), but it has made us lazy; people often listen to something on the news and are unwilling to check and see if the data is true. Also, many people don't even care to watch the news because television has a plethora of other things available to watch (entertainment shows).<br>  <br>  Technology in general has enslaved us to our own creation; 10 years ago, cell phones were not a necessity, and people easily made phone calls to each other without needing a cell phone. Now, especially with teenagers, cell phones seem to be a necessity only because we've MADE it a necessity. I could easily use a payphone or a house phone to interact with friends, but now that cell phones are so popular, people are unwilling to part from it and have made it a necessity. As Thoreau once said, "We do not ride upon the railroad, it rides upon us."<br>  <br>  So in general, technology has made us a society that has many resources for quick knowledge, but it has made us a society that is unwilling to fully connect with other humans, and the ease with which we can attain knowledge is easily taken for granted, so many people are too lazy to even gain the knowledge that is open through the internet, television, etc.<br>  <br>  Hopefully these will give you some ideas as to what to write.

AA11158580	What are you majoring in? I would start with checking with an academic advisor. If anything you would need to take classes along the lines with secondary education & higher education. At the colleges where I live, a teacher needs a bachelor's degree & a teaching certificate to teach at the college. Their degree is in subject which they are teaching - example: major=nursing you can teach nursing as long as you have that bachelor's degree. As I said before, check with an advisor for futher information or check with the college itself. These will be great places to start!|`|oTxufwbEaa	Depends on your subject and where you want to teach.  You can get a teaching certificate with your Bachelor's degree with some majors.  That will get you into most secondary schools and some community colleges.  A master's degree will get you into any community college, some colleges and some universities.  A PhD will get you into any school on some level.|`|eh2KiSTMaa	In general, teachers at universities fall into three categories: graduate students who are teaching as part of their requirements to earn a degree and have some amount of teaching evaluations under their portfolios, professors, who teach usually in combination with research and/or service, and lecturers, whose full-time job is just to teach.  The trend here is that most of these individuals either have, or are on track to earn their PhD is whichever field you are interested in going into.  Myself, for instance, am planning on entering a graduate program in business management (organizational behavior and human resources management).  To proactively work towards becoming a teacher at a research university, I might first ask yourself if you want to ONLY teach, or would also like to conduct research.  Next, start looking into taking graduate admissions tests such as the GRE (general), GMAT (business), or LSAT (law school).  Scoring highly on these is often a prerequisite before going into a graduate program.  Decent undergraduate grades are of course important, but the correlation between grades and graduate performance is not very strong.  I would say anything above a 3.3 would be okay, so long as your test scores are pretty good (above the 80th percentile for sure).  Other than that, just talk to faculty around your school and ask them what the process was like for them to become a teacher.  Hope this helps!|`|t7OCoFdIaa	You need to go to grad school.

It is a thematic variation of that. I think that we all have some self destructive moments where we let in the guilt or shame of something enter and dominate our thinking. The trick to getting past that kind of thinking is to do something to put that behind you. I had a near death experience and when my heart stopped for ten minutes I had an out of body experience; I was looking at myself on the floor of the hospital with the nurses giving me CPR. I heard a voice ask the question: "Why have you worried so much in your life?" I looked at the nurse on my chest pumping my heart and realized that I may be dying. The voice then asked: "What good is it now?" I thought about this for many years and I do not worry about anything small. I live in the now and do not let the little worries bother me.

It is one of a series from which the movie Blade Runner was based. In the novel, Rick Deckard is a troubled bounty hunter who is questioning his job of killing human-like androids. He confronts old man Mercer who tells him, "You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe."<br>  <br>  Philip Dick is describing a philosophy that states that life contains both good and evil. Life begins idealistically, but as we live it, we face situations again and again where we are forced to violate our own principles, like the pregnant mother who says that she won't feed her baby anything but nutritious food and not let him watch TV.  Nevertheless, by the time that the baby is two or three, the reality of life is that she frequently needs the break that she can only get by sitting him in front of the tube for a few hours with a bottle full of Kool-Aid. She feels a little bad about settling for so little for him, but she is grateful that he's quiet for two hours. And she may feel some guilt. Author Philip Dick is telling us with this quote that nothing is easy, nothing is pure. Yet we must go on. <br>  <br>  We are taught all of our lives about man's nobility and purity, how if we apply ourselves, we can accomplish anything, and how good triumphs over evil. But as life goes on, the good aren't always rewarded, evil often triumphs, and mediocrity seeps into our lives from every direction and mixes with the good and ideal. No matter how high your goals, how pure your ideals or how faithfully you apply yourself toward attaining them, although you will at times achieve those goals, you will also often fall short, compromise and in the end, betray yourself. You have no choice, because that is an imperative of life even if you didn't know it.<br>  <br>  In the end, we must come to grips with the fact that we are disappointing copies of our preferred version of ourselves. Philip Dick's books are all about the idea that we are no longer the basis of our own ideals, and that eventually, we all must come to terms with the baseness and meaninglessness of some of our choices and simply go on with life.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dymaxionweb.com/kulturedrome/archives/2006_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dymaxionweb.com/kulturedrome/...</a><br>  <br>  Darkwing is correct. This is the philosophy called antitranscendentalism. It was a literary reaction to the transcendentalists. Both were literary styles characteristic of the American northeast from 1840-1860, a period called the New England renaissance. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson were the dominant transcendentalists. Their work was cheery and hopeful. Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville were the principle antitranscendentalists, after whose tradition Philip Dick continues. The characters of their novels were flawed, like the adulterous Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter," or Captain Ahab from Melville's "Moby Dick" who was obsessed in his pursuit to destroy evil unto his own destruction. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/52337.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/5...</a><br>  <a href="http://beastmaster2000.blogspot.com/2007/02/anti-transcendentalism.html" rel="nofollow">http://beastmaster2000.blogspot.com/2007...</a>

Over the years there has been more and more research and now as we speak, countries all over the world are together looking into the cases of autism. It is mainly believed that autism is genetics, some hold the belief that it is to do with the MMR jab. but I have never believed this to be so.<br>  <br>  If your child is autistic it is due to NO fault of your own, nothing to do with stimulating the child, nothing to do with love nor care....In the 1950-1960's women were imprisoned for the fact their children were autistic. A doctor at the time held the belief that they had caused their children to be this way, and sadly most believed him.<br>  <br>  I have four young boys, three with autism. They are all different, all unique and all have been loved, nurtured and supported since birth. They all have the triad of traits that simplify autism....<br>  Lack of communication<br>  Lack of imagination<br>  Lack of social skills.....<br>  But all at different levels. Our four year old is higher functioning, he is seen by most as 'normal' but to the knowing eye he has problems. our five year old is mid autism, he has problems with communicating his needs and it affects most of his day to day routines.<br>  Our eight year old is sever, he has many problems that run with autism and has one to one support at school.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autism.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=225" rel="nofollow">http://www.autism.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopol...</a>|`|yv1dRwF9aa	No, you are born with autism. There is such a thing as delayed onset autism linked to MMR vaccine, but it is not a stimulation issue. It is possible to not notice autism until later stages of development, but again it's not due to lack of stimulation. Lack of stimulation could result in similar symtoms, such as lack of social skills, but this is not technically autism.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	no--but they can have asutistic like beahviors<br>  <br>  thre haven been studies of children who have been SEVERELY deproved--like 50 infants to 1 caretaker in an orphanage--or being locked in a room without any interaction/stimulatio--the brain doesn't develop..<br>  <br>  the difference here is that there is actually brain damage--in autism--brain scans don't show teh same lack of development|`|AA11247439	severe neglect can cause one to appear autistic but there is a big difference.<br>  <br>  read this article for more clarification.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feralchildren.com/en/autism.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralchildren.com/en/autism.p...</a>|`|xTb8u783aa	no they cannot
8vKrxSYyaa	The answer is indeed Communism but I am not doing your homework for you.  The teacher gave it for you to do.  You will learn nothing by asking someone else to answer it for you.|`|AA12098193	The phrasing is odd. I would say that the economical model is part of the political system, not the other way around, so what system "works best" for the model seems odd.<br>  Anyway, The now extinct communist block or rather the socialist countries, were typically known for applying a centralized economic model. An open market economy usually implies a smaller government or at least a non intrusive government. Centralized planing requires strong controls over what is produce and how it is consumed. That way "the plan" can be guaranteed to work.<br>  Open market economies will concentrate resources where they are not "indispensable" and leave social sectors (the poor) with no resources.<br>  Centralized economies are meant to distribute evenly whatever is available. But then again this is not possible if the government is not in control of production.

Do you tell people or do you not say anything?<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm mildly dyslexic and I think I'm also dyspraxic. (dyspraxia)<br>  <br>  A lot of people have a fear of public speaking. The key is learning to overcome it. It can be done. I have that fear and I took a public speaking class and it helps. <br>  <br>  A problem with what I have is that I learn differently. It's not much of a problem really but it can be difficult because I need structure/organization or I can't function well. I get very nervous - confused - upset. Communication can be tricky - finding the right words to express - ask the right questions. I have an MBA. I'm not dumb and I'm not lazy. But I can feel dumb. It just spirals down from there. I wonder - is it me or would others feel the same in this situation - should I even think of this? I don't know. It's distressing. I work very hard - I struggle - I don't always know how to communicate in the most effective manner.

It's sad to say, but one of you will have to be VERY lenient with her.  We have a son with Mild Autism, and I can't imagine how he would deal with having such a screwed up schedule.

The market change, sometimes its IT, sometimes engineering...and so on.<br>  <br>  Also, all career options are good, provide you choose them as per you talent and skill strenghts, cuz if you don't and just join a popular course without the right talent, you will struggle, which will affect your grade.<br>  <br>  The end result will be that nobody wants an average student with a popular degree. Companies look for excellence.<br>  <br>  Hence you can see there are successful people in all profession, so also there are unsuccessful people in popular professions like - doctors and engineers who are not successful, because of their bad decision and lack of adequate skill.<br>  <br>  Saying that, since you are in 10th, you have plenty of options -<br>  <br>  ARTS - about literature, history, legal (law) etc., - you need to be good in languages, comfortable with remember dates etc., as history and legal stuff has many dates and Acts etc., to remember.<br>  <br>  COMMERCE - about accounting - you need to be good in simple calculations - (Maths is optional, but opting for Maths will make you eligible for higher studies like - CA, ICWA etc.,)<br>  <br>  a brief is given in the following link -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://genwis.com/commerce/commerce_accounting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://genwis.com/commerce/commerce_acco...</a><br>  <br>  SCIENCE - is about applied and pure science (applied = engineering, pure = theoretical). While you need to be good in science and maths for pure science (B.Sc), you need to be really excellent in them for engineering (B.E. / B.Tech)<br>  <br>  a brief on engineering fields is given in the below link -<br>  <br>  Other option is MBBS.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://genwis.com/Engineering/engineering" rel="nofollow">http://genwis.com/Engineering/engineerin...</a><br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  Alternate Options:-<br>  <br>  If you have some creative talent like drawing, writing etc., after 12th (any stream) you can do Mass Media & Communication - you can choose either Journalism or Advertisement / TV&Media / PR / Event management etc.,<br>  <br>  OR, if you like computers, and are good in drawing, you can do B.Sc in Animation after 12th (any stream)....its has great scope, as most of the big animation industries of the world are getting job done from us.<br>  <br>  So, choose as per your interest and the ones that suits your skills and talent, and you will always be successful....and all successful people earn good MONEY.<br>  <br>  all the best !!!!<br>  <br>  PS: On personal note, since you will be free after your 10th, you can read this book - Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

AA11158580	My GPA in high school was extra crappy and definitely did not reflect how I was as a student. I had no problem getting into college for my undergrad and I was accepted into graduate college with no problems. I think once you get to the graduate level, they only care about the grades and gpa you had at the undergraduate level. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|DyUlb5beaa	Nope, all that matters is your undergraduate transcript.|`|BBht4bGsaa	No, they do not look at it at all.|`|4xcqK9Jjaa	No definitely not. Graduate schools do not request a high school transcript. Only a complete undergraduate transcript.|`|GoVm7QU7aa	I think that the Grad schools would consider it but if your grades in college are pretty good then I think that they will overlook your High School GPA.|`|eh2KiSTMaa	No, a bad high school GPA could hardly hurt your chances of getting accepted to a grad school program.  However, it could of course hurt your chances of getting into an undergraduate program, and graduate schools examine the prestige of the undergraduate university you are attending.  As you noted, your high school GPA is not a real reflection of your ability as a student.  In fact, this is often the case with undergraduate GPAs being a poor predictor of post-educational performance.  Therefore, grad schools tend to place more weight on other proxies for GPA, such as test scores (GRE, GMAT, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), letters of recommendations, and research experience (if you are looking to enter a position as a tenure-track faculty member [professor]).  Still, undergraduate GPAs do have some weight, and some programs even require a minimum 3.0 to even be considered.  I wouldn't by any means recommend shirking your work, but certainly other factors can compensate for low grades (but only so much).  Hope this helps!

GCicPp7daa	Below are some ideas for things to write about that are relevant issues on a national basis.  See if one catches your fancy.<br>  <br>  * Tenants nationwide are becoming progressively more environmentally conscious.  What can commercial property managers and property owners do to make existing buildings (that were not designed to be green) more attractive to these tenants?  - hint look into LEED for existing buildings, the USGBC website and BOMA's BEEP program for material. <br>  <br>  * Energy costs are the single largest controllable expense in an office building.  How can commercial property managers mitigate the rising cost of utilities on the value of their buildings?<br>  <br>  * In challenging economic times, what can commercial property owners do to attract and retain credit tenants in leases that will not erode the asset's value?  - think about lease flexibility and how near term "pain" can leave a landlord with a favorable exit strategy when the market begins to recover.  Look at the reasearch from large firms like CB Richard Ellis, Jones Lang LaSalle, and Cushman & Wakefield.<br>  <br>  * What roles and responsibilities can and should a property management team take on when there is an armed gunman / bomb threat / riot in or around the office building?  - Think this through a bit, and you will see that there is no perfect pre-scripted response to this type of situation.<br>  <br>  Hope this at least sparked some ideas.  Good luck on your paper, and if all else fails, go to on of the big firm's websites I listed above and look at their white papers for other ideas.

It could be any of the following or one of your own invention:<br>  - She offended a more popular person that herself, and they have told everyone to hate her (which is a fairly common storyline and works well).<br>  - She has trouble making friends.<br>  - She might be different for example: She might not like the same types of things as everyone else eg. music and clothing.<br>  - She has embarrassed herself in front of the entire school in some way which has earnt her a reputation for mucking things up.<br>  <br>  Another good place to start would to set out her personality:<br>  - Is she kind?<br>  - Is she mean?<br>  - Is she pretty?<br>  - What clique she may have once belonged to.<br>  Doing this might help you assess where a good place to start is.<br>  <br>  Another thing you'll have to consider is the way she is treated by others:<br>  - Is she practically invisible or ignored?<br>  - Is she teased or bullied in some way?<br>  <br>  I can't really offer you any more advice but I hope this helps and good luck with your essay!

jT1mPev9aa	1.  It's possible that isn't told what is being hatched simply because it keeps the reader curious (simply a technique used by Aldoux Huxley), that, or they don't tell you what is being hatched because the want to heavily highlight the  way they treat the hatchings.   Like, they treat it as if they were in a factory and product testing, instead of treating the hatchings with emotions and feelings like humans.   They treat it as things (material value, nothing spiritual or emotional, as if the hatchings lacked feelings).  <br>  <br>  2.  It's social stable because the Bok. process is a fixed process.   They purposed create a world full of people that are unequal, if everyone was equal, they would always want the same things and therefore, decreasing the social stability because competition for the best things and status would increase.  No one wants to be at the bottom of the social structure, instead of letting it be natural, if they fixed the process, there are people who are happy at the bottom of the hierarchial structure.   The structure is designed so that everyone is generally happy about their status.  <br>  <br>  4.  So I think Huxley uses the alpha-beta-gamma ttiles for humans to indicate their status in society as a way to explain their behavior (those at the bottom have the right to behave in an inferior way without subjection to harsh disdain, although they are not respected, they may not be condemned for their positions, they are simply excused).    That is the significance (using these titles allowed room for certain people to make mistakes, allowed people have certain expectations of other people, and miminizing surprise within human behavior).|`|Syn2excFaa	Read this short summary of the main points of the novel so you can answer those questions:<br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/section1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/s...</a><br>  Look at left menu for other chapters.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Acting is kind of a fluky field, because although one can get a degree in acting, that isn't the most common way of getting into the field.  Usually people are picked out of auditions for their talent or looks, and it has little to do with any degrees they do or don't have.<br>  <br>  According to biographies of Tom Cruise, he is dyslexic, so school was hard for him.  His mother was an actress, which may have given him an idea of going into that field, and he was successful in high school productions.  He didn't become famous right after dropping out - it seems to have taken about four or five years.  His breakthrough role, in Risky Business, was in 1983, and he was born in 1962, so he would have been about 21.  Again, he was lucky.  Had that film been a flop, we might never have heard of him.

It is the most supreme academic title available and so one who is really a professor should be addressed as such.  Strong academic credentials are required to be a professor.  Whether that includes having a doctoral degree depends on the type of college and field of study. So to answer your question, yes it is possible for a JD to be a professor, usually at a community college however.<br>  <br>  However, keep in mind that many instructional members at colleges are not professors at all.  Rather their title is that of instructor, or at the lowest level, a lecturer.  They may have advanced degrees too, including doctoral degrees. In this case a student would address them as Dr..   Else simply address them as Mr/Ms if they only have a masters.|`|IXskJPlVaa	All teachers at University are referred to as professors - technically - it is a designation - in the hierarchy, and varies from Univ to Univ.

CtqWRAcFaa	The current economic conditions have smothered the nation in a blanket of fear. Many people fear that the downed financial markets and the loss of jobs will lead to another depression. <br>  <br>  But even though the unemployment rates are rising and the crisis in the stock market will make for a difficult year, the current situation is still not close to what occurred in the 1930's. This fear of a recession is what aided the current recession. People are afraid of losing their jobs, so they began saving their money.  This decrease in consumer spending increased layoffs.  We caused the recession but we can also fix it.<br>  <br>  Large corporations such as the "big box" stores have always had the advantage over smaller, individually-owned businesses. With their outside investors, they have a greater number of resources to fall back on when needed. The single goal of large businesses is to create a profit, often at the unintentional expense of the economy. <br>  <br>  For example, these corporations look for cheaper labor costs and the consequent increase in perceived profit by sending jobs overseas. But exporting jobs increases domestic unemployment.  People are now unable to purchase these corporations' goods, leaving the companies with a loss. These losses are what created the  need for the government bailouts in September 2008. The government has to get the money from somewhere though, and  taxing working people makes them unable or unwilling to do much spending -- leaving us in a continuous cycle.<br>  <br>  Small business owners without wealthy investors to finance their business pursuits depend on bank loans to start up. When the mortgage crisis occurred, the banks were more selective about their borrowers, leaving small business owners without many options. <br>  <br>  Small businesses that are already running are having a harder time making a profit.  Society is spending less and small businesses are having trouble staying afloat; many do not make it. Even in a normal economy, only 80% of small businesses succeed past their first year.  It is even harder in these trying economical times.<br>  <br>  As a high school student living with my parents, I have very few financial responsibilities. However, I am aware that this economy may not change by the time I get out of school, so I want to be as prepared for it as possible. My education will be a very important factor in my future. If I want to succeed in the business world, I need to have a solid college education to allow me to cope with anything the economy throws at me.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Finding the right places for paragraphs was difficult for this essay because the paragraphs have no structure.  Most of your sentences are undeveloped "topic sentences" strung together with no elaboration.<br>  <br>  For example, I thought that your essay was going to detail the differences between the current economic situation and the Great Depression because you wrote this: "Even though the unemployment rates are rising and the crises in the stock market will make for a difficult year it is still no where near what occurred in the 1930's." But you just wrote it and then dropped it, never to mention it again.<br>  <br>  Then I thought that your essay was going to be on this topic: " We caused the recession but we can also fix it." But it turned out to be just another topic sentence you wrote and then dropped without ever mentioning it again.<br>  <br>  This is what makes your essay seem unfocused and meandering. It seems like the title of this piece would be "Some Random Stuff I Remember From Class," or maybe, "I Don't Have Anything to Say on This Topic."<br>  <br>  Your essay would be vastly improved if it had a narrow focus that you developed properly. I think you could dismiss the "business" part of the assignment with one or two strong paragraphs, and then dig deeper for the part about how it affects you. Make up some details about curtailing your own spending, inability to find a job, and your parents' actions. If you develop this topic, you will have a much better paper.<br>  <br>  NOTE: It is not uncommon for the openings and endings of essays to be weak, as you noticed yourself. Very often the remedy is just to delete them when you are proofreading.|`|JeVxDmfYaa	not bad.. good job.. i like it.. <br>  <br>  may I advise that you proofread it for grammar and misspelled words.. Also, you should have your friends or teacher re-read it and for some insights.. but overall its a good paper.. <br>  <br>  I don't mind editing for you if you want..

For this reason, I would chose Harvard. That been said I think students at non-harvard could easily out smart me. If I attend that school, I would also have to worked hard to be the very best. But since we all know that getting accepted into Harvard is like winning the lottery, I would chose Harvard. Ultimately, it is your decision. You have to see if Harvard would benefit you socially, academically and financially.<br>  <br>  ss|`|b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	the very best student at a lesser, public, state school|`|bFfWFsFWaa	It would depend on what I was going for. If I was going to be a teacher, I'd prefer to be the best at a lesser public school. Any collage is a lot of work and stress, and going to Ivy league would be very very very stressful. If I were to be a teacher, I wouldn't feel the need to put myself through all of that because I could do just as well afterwards with a lesser public school education. Right now, I'm at Notre Dame to be a high school history teacher. Definitely not worth it. The work is terrible and I'd be so much more happy at a lesser public school. The only reason I'm here right now is because of the bigger scholarship.<br>     If I were going to be a doctor or a lawyer, then the bigger education is more important. I'd rather be an average student at Harvard. More jobs would be open, more opportunity, and a better education all around. As a patient, I'd want someone who graduated from Duke, Yale or Princton or some place Ivy league. The title of one of those schools just means a better education. But just for basic jobs in business or schools or something like that, the stress is NOT worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>     For everyone who says Harvard because of the challenge and being able to prove it to themselves...go to collage.

AA10067221	I am pretty sure that the word you are looking for is Pathos.<br>  <br>  Pathos: Pathos is related to the words pathetic, sympathy and empathy.  Whenever you accept an claim based on how it makes you feel without fully analyzing the rationale behind the claim, you are acting on pathos.  They may be any emotions: love, fear, patriotism, guilt, hate or joy.  A majority of arguments in the popular press are heavily dependent on pathetic appeals.  The more people react without full consideration for the WHY, the more effective an argument can be.  Although the pathetic appeal can be manipulative, it is the cornerstone of moving people to action.  Many arguments are able to persuade people logically, but the apathetic audience may not follow through on the call to action.  Appeals to pathos touch a nerve and compel people to not only listen, but to also take the next step and act in the world. <br>  <br>  To Appeal to Emotion (pathos)  <br>  <br>  Vivid, concrete language <br>  Emotionally loaded language <br>  Connotative meanings <br>  Emotional examples <br>  Vivid descriptions <br>  Narratives of emotional events <br>  Emotional tone <br>  Figurative language <br>  <br>  Evokes an emotional response|`|WyCmQBuvaa	sympathetic<br>  empathetic<br>   <br>  or<br>  <br>  exciting, provoking, tormenting, insulting, infuriating, inspiring, stimulating<br>  <br>  The descriptions appeal in what way?<br>  ??   appeals to the reader?? or appeals to another character in a book?|`|car4UyLFaa	If you're asking about logical fallacies, check out this page: <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html#index" rel="nofollow">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies...</a><br>  <br>  There's the 'appeal to emotion', 'appeal to pity', and 'ad hominem'

SW9GlSCWaa	No início do Regime Militar a infla??o chega a 80% ao ano, o crescimento do Produto Nacional Bruto (PNB) é de apenas 1,6% ao ano e a taxa de investimentos é quase nula. Diante desse quadro, o governo adota uma política recessiva e monetarista, consolidada no Programa de A??o Econ?mica do Governo (Paeg), elaborado pelos ministros da Fazenda, Roberto de Oliveira Campos e Octávio Gouvêa de Bulh?es. Seus objetivos s?o sanear a economia e baixar a infla??o para 10% ao ano, criar condi??es para que o PNB cres?a 6% ao ano, equilibrar o balan?o de pagamentos e diminuir as desigualdades regionais. Parte desses objetivos é alcan?ada. No entanto, em 1983, a infla??o ultrapassa os 200% e a dívida externa supera os US$ 90 bilh?es. <br>  <br>  Para sanear a economia, o governo imp?e uma política recessiva: diminui o ritmo das obras públicas, corta subsídios, principalmente ao petróleo e aos produtos da cesta básica, dificulta o crédito interno. Em pouco tempo aumenta o números de falências e concordatas. Paralelamente, para estimular o crescimento do PNB, oferece amplos incentivos fiscais, de crédito e cambiais aos setores exportadores. Garante ao capital estrangeiro uma flexível lei de remessas de lucro, m?o-de-obra barata e sindicatos sob controle. Extingue a estabilidade no emprego e, em seu lugar, estabelece o Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Servi?o (FGTS). No final do governo Castello Branco a infla??o baixa para 23% anuais. A capacidade ociosa da indústria é grande, o custo de vida está mais alto, há grande número de desempregados, acentuada concentra??o de renda e da propriedade. <br>  <br>  Para financiar o déficit público, o governo lan?a no mercado as Obriga??es Reajustáveis do Tesouro Nacional (ORTNs). Estimula a constru??o civil criando o Banco Nacional de Habita??o (BNH) para operar com os recursos captados pelo FGTS. Estabelece também a corre??o monetária como estímulo à capta??o de poupan?a num momento de infla??o alta. Ao fazer isso, cria um mecanismo que, na prática, indexa a economia e perpetua a infla??o. <br>  <br>  A economia volta a crescer no governo Castello Branco. Os setores mais dinamicos s?o as indústrias da constru??o civil e de bens de consumo duráveis voltados para classes de alta renda, como automóveis e eletrodomésticos. Expandem-se também a pecuária e os produtos agrícolas de exporta??o. Os bens de consumo n?o-duráveis, como cal?ados, vestuário, têxteis e produtos alimentícios destinados à popula??o de baixa renda têm crescimento reduzido ou até negativo. <br>  <br>  No campo das rela??es econ?micas externas, procurou-se recuperar credibilidade junto aos organismos multilaterais de crédito, aos investidores estrangeiros e aos países industrializados - especialmente os Estados Unidos. Estimulou-se a entrada de capitais, com expectativas de que a Alian?a para o Progresso se tornasse uma fonte de capta??o relevante. Ao mesmo tempo que se recuperava o apoio financeiro externo, o desempenho agrícola contribuiu para reequilibrar a balan?a comercial. <br>  <br>  PRIMóRDIOS <br>  <br>  A partir de 1967, com a mudan?a de governo, o crescimento tornou-se a meta econ?mica primordial. Foi elaborado o Plano Estratégico de Desenvolvimento (PED) para o período de 1968 a 1970. O crescimento econ?mico foi impulsionado pelo bom desempenho nas indústrias de bens duráveis (automóveis e eletrodomésticos) e de constru??o civil. As indústrias de material elétrico, química, constru??o naval e de bens de capital também aumentaram sua produ??o. O demanda por bens duráveis aumentou em virtude dos consórcios e do fornecimento de crédito ao consumidor por empresas financeiras. O Sistema Financeiro da Habita??o, o BNH e o FGTS estiveram por trás da expans?o da constru??o civil, que passou a contratar mais. Com isso, cresceram o consumo agregado e a produ??o das indústrias metalúrgica e de minerais n?o-metálicos. <br>  <br>  A política monetária antiinflacionária de altas taxas de juros do período anterior tinha reduzido o consumo e o investimento agregados. Com o PIB abaixo de sua taxa natural, o objetivo do plano era estimular a demanda privada. Foram adotadas políticas monetária e fiscal expansionistas. A oferta de moeda e o crédito ao setor privado foram expandidos e os gastos do governo aumentaram. A?o e outros insumos básicos para a indústria automobilística foram barateados. Sob a gest?o de Ant?nio Delfim Netto (1967-74), foram expandidos os investimentos de infra-estrutura, estendida a presen?a do Estado na economia e ampliado o segmento técnico-burocrático alocado em atividades de planejamento. Em 1972, foi lan?ado o I Plano Nacional de Desenvolvimento (PND), que reuniu um conjunto de metas de crescimento setorizadas, a serem alcan?adas até 1974. O "modelo brasileiro" seria organizar o governo de modo a tornar a economia plenamente desenvolvida no espa?o de uma gera??o. Os custos da indústria nacional seriam reduzidos pelo fornecimento governamental de insumos básicos mais baratos. As exporta??es, principalmente de produtos manufaturados, seriam diversificadas. Seriam feitos investimentos em educa??o, no desenvolvimento tecnológico e na agricultura. Surgia no Brasil uma "tecnocracia" e as empresas estatais dilatavam seu raio de a??o com base na expans?o de seu endividamento externo. Para complementar, foi ativada uma rede de programas de financiamento e investimento, gerenciados por agências públicas e bancos oficiais. <br>  <br>  OS ANOS DO MILAGRE <br>  <br>  Os anos de 1969 a 1973 foram o período de maior crescimento da história da economia brasileira. A disponibilidade externa de capital e a determina??o dos governos militares de fazer do Brasil uma “potência emergente” viabilizam pesados investimentos em infra-estrutura (rodovias, ferrovias, telecomunica??es, portos, usinas hidrelétricas, usinas nucleares), nas indústrias de base (minera??o e siderurgia), de transforma??o (papel, cimento, alumínio, produtos químicos, fertilizantes), equipamentos (geradores, sistemas de telefonia, máquinas, motores, turbinas), bens duráveis (veículos e eletrodomésticos) e na agroindústria de alimentos (gr?os, carnes, laticínios). O setor de bens de consumo duráveis foi o que mais se expandiu. O retorno ao crescimento foi facilitado pela existência de capacidade ociosa do período anterior, pela nova estrutura de financiamento montada no PAEG e pela disponibilidade de empréstimos estrangeiros. Na falta de poupan?a doméstica, a poupan?a externa foi a alternativa viável. Gra?as a um conjunto de incentivos governamentais, observou-se um importante crescimento e moderniza??o da agricultura, que logo teve impacto sobre as exporta??es. As exporta??es aumentaram e o volume de empréstimos externos superou o montante utilizado para financiar o crescimento. Houve, ent?o, grande acúmulo de reservas cambiais. Entre 1968 e 1973 a taxa média de crescimento do Produto Interno foi de 11,2%. Neste mesmo período, os índices de expans?o da atividade industrial variaram, conforme o setor, entre 12 e 18 %. Este desempenho levou o período a ser conhecido no Brasil como "o milagre econ?mico". A economia atingiu o pleno emprego em 1970. A partir deste ano, investimentos foram destinados a ampliar a capacidade produtiva da economia. O auge do milagre econ?mico deu-se nos anos de 1972 e 1973. <br>  <br>  O crescimento da atividade industrial foi acompanhado pelo aumento dos investimentos externos, com a presen?a de firmas norte-americanas, européias e japonesas. Estas empresas - incentivadas pela legisla??o local - contribuíram para a expans?o das exporta??es de produtos manufaturados e para o avan?o da tecnologia industrial no país. Em 1973, a entrada de capitais passou de 4,3 bilh?es de dólares. Isto significava o dobro do patamar de 1971 e o triplo de 1970. De fato, o novo perfil industrial e agrícola brasileiro logo se refletiu nas rela??es econ?micas externas do país. O peso do café no comércio exterior brasileiro reduziu-se sensivelmente, registrando-se entre 1955 e 1975 um declínio de 53% para 10,8%. O aumento e diversifica??o das exporta??es e de seus destinos foi acompanhado pelo crescimento das importa??es - especialmente de bens de capital e petróleo. Este processo foi estimulado pelo Conselho de Comércio Exterior (CONCEX), criado em 1968. <br>  <br>  No campo financeiro, o Brasil iniciou um processo de crescente endividamento externo, no qual a participa??o de empréstimos privados tornou-se cada vez mais relevante. Nos anos 1968-73, a dívida externa do país saltou de US$ 3,780 para US$ 12,571 bilh?es. A gama de opera??es de crédito contratadas direta ou indiretamente pelas empresas públicas foi beneficiada pela conjuntura de ampla liquidez do mercado financeiro internacional. O impacto deste endividamento foi neutralizado por confortáveis reservas e o positivo desempenho das exporta??es. <br>  <br>  O PRE?O DO MILAGRE <br>  <br>  Este equilíbrio come?ou a romper-se no início dos anos setenta, quando se passou a sentir o peso do servi?o da dívida (juros e amortiza??es). Novas dificuldades emergiram com a crise do petróleo de 1973, que provocou a drástica redu??o das reservas brasileiras. Nesta época, o petróleo representava aproximadamente 40% do total da energia básica consumida no Brasil. A estreita dependência brasileira deste insumo tornou difícil manter o ritmo prévio de crescimento econ?mico. A partir de 1973 o crescimento econ?mico come?a a declinar. No final da década de 70 a infla??o chega a 94,7% ao ano. Em 1980 bate em 110% e, em 1983, em 200%. Nesse ano, a dívida externa ultrapassa os US$ 90 bilh?es e 90% da receita das exporta??es é utilizada para o pagamento dos juros da dívida. O Brasil mergulha em nova recess?o e sua principal conseqüência é o desemprego. Em agosto de 1981 há 900 mil desempregados nas regi?es metropolitanas do país e a situa??o se agrava nos anos seguintes.Nos anos 1973 / 74, o valor das importa??es brasileiras de combustíveis e lubrificantes saltou de US$ 169 para US$ 2.962. Ao mesmo tempo, aumentaram significativamente as compras externas de insumos e equipamentos. <br>  <br>  O Milagre Econ?mico revelou seu "calcanhar de Aquiles" no campo social. O aumento da renda agregada n?o se distribuiu para todos e houve tendência à sua concentra??o. O crescimento rápido beneficiou a m?o-de-obra especializada e o valor do salário mínimo real declinou consideravelmente ("O país vai bem e o povo vai mal", diria o General Médici em 1971). Em 1979, apenas 4% da popula??o economicamente ativa do Rio de Janeiro e S?o Paulo ganha acima de dez salários mínimos. A maioria, 40%, recebe até três salários mínimos. Além disso, o valor real do salário mínimo cai drasticamente. Em 1959, um trabalhador que ganhasse salário mínimo precisava trabalhar 65 horas para comprar os alimentos necessários à sua família. No final da década de 70 o número de horas necessárias passa para 153. No campo, a maior parte dos trabalhadores n?o recebe sequer o salário mínimo. <br>  <br>  Os indicadores de qualidade de vida da popula??o despencam. A mortalidade infantil no Estado de S?o Paulo , o mais rico do país, salta de 70 por mil nascidos vivos em 1964 para 91,7 por mil em 1971. No mesmo ano, registra-se a existência de 600 mil menores abandonados na Grande S?o Paulo. Em 1972, de 3.950 municípios do país, apenas 2.638 têm abastecimento de água. Três anos depois um relatório do Banco Mundial mostra que 70 milh?es de brasileiros s?o desnutridos, o equivalente a 65,4% da popula??o, na época de 107 milh?es de pessoas. O Brasil tem o 9o PNB do mundo, mas em desnutri??o perde apenas para índia , Indonésia , Bangladesh , Paquist?o e Filipinas .|`|0faaf8fa3b7a14f449d2bca46f87d6b3aa	resposta<br>  Milagre econ?mico=O "milagre econ?mico" é a denomina??o dada à época de excepcional crescimento econ?mico ocorrido durante a ditadura militar, ou anos de chumbo. Nesse período áureo do desenvolvimento brasileiro em que, paradoxalmente, houve aumento da concentra??o de renda e da pobreza, instaurou-se um pensamento ufanista de "Brasil potência", que se evidencia com a conquista da terceira Copa do Mundo de Futebol em 1970 no México, e a cria??o do mote de significado dúbio: "Brasil, ame-o ou deixe-o".<br>  <br>  As três vitórias na Copa do Mundo ajudaram a manter no ar um clima de euforia generalizada, nunca antes vista, e daquilo que Elio Gaspari apelidou de "patriotadas". O Brasil cantava:<br>  <br>              "Noventa milh?es em a??o,<br>              pra frente, Brasil<br>              do meu cora??o(...)<br>              Salve a sele??o."<br>  <br>  Foi um período paradoxal da História do Brasil. Diz Elio Gaspari, em sua obra exaustiva [1] :<br>  <br>          O Milagre Brasileiro e os Anos de Chumbo foram simultaneos. Ambos reais, co-existiam negando-se. Passados mais de trinta anos, continuam negando-se. Quem acha que houve um, n?o acredita (ou n?o gosta de admitir) que houve o outro. [1]<br>  <br>  Como se iniciou<br>  <br>  Após o governo de Juscelino Kubitschek, entre 1956 e 1961, no qual o Brasil passou por acelerado crescimento econ?mico gra?as ao Plano de Metas - o programa "cinqüenta anos em cinco" - que era baseado na política de substitui??o de importa??es sob a inspira??o da CEPAL, e com a constru??o de Brasília, surgiu uma forte press?o inflacionária no País, já sentida no final do governo JK e que se agravou com a renúncia de Janio Quadros e com os impasses institucionais que marcaram o período de Jo?o Goulart (1961-1964). Tais factos fizeram com que se elevassem os défices do governo de tal forma que se formou uma forte infla??o de demanda.<br>  <br>  Logo após o Golpe Militar que se seguiu em abril de 1964, no início do governo Castelo Branco, foi criado um primeiro Programa de A??o Econ?mica do Governo - PAEG [2], com dois objetivos básicos: formular políticas conjunturais de combate à infla??o, associadas a reformas estruturais, que permitiram o equacionamento dos problemas inflacionários causados pela política de substitui??o de importa??es e das dificuldades que se colocavam ao crescimento econ?mico; o que requeria, agora, que fosse dado um segundo passo no processo: a expans?o da indústria de base (siderurgia, energia, petroquímica) para evitar que o aumento da produ??o de bens industriais de consumo final, ampliada pela política de substitui??o de importa??es, provocasse um aumento insustentável nas importa??es brasileiras de insumos básicos, que a indústria nascente consumia de forma crescente.<br>  <br>  Após um período inicial recessivo, de ajuste, que foi de mar?o de 1964 até fins de 1967 - com a reorganiza??o do sistema financeiro, a recupera??o da capacidade fiscal do Estado e com uma maior estabilidade monetária - iniciou-se em 1968 um período de forte expans?o econ?mica no Brasil.<br>  <br>  De 1968 a 1973 o PIB brasileiro cresceu a uma taxa média acima de 10% ao ano, a infla??o oscilou entre 15% e 20% ao ano e a constru??o civil cresceu, em média, 15% ao ano. Durante essa fase, o grande arquiteto e executor das políticas econ?micas no Brasil foi Ant?nio Delfim Netto, que chegou a ser chamado de "super-ministro".|`|87d4eeaf51e98e7a8e7f876422836c19aa	resposta de engenheiro mais sucinta possivel e q odeia historia: <br>  foi um dos periodos de maior crescimento no brasil, teve forte impacto na economia pois indutrializou bastante o país, por isso foi bom, mas qnd acabou foi péssimo, por incompetencia do governo que nao conseguiu fazer as reformas que o brasil necessitava..

White tiles, porcelain sinks. Same feelings of ecstasy having escaped from class.  When "opposite sex's name" walked in.  I had adventured into a bathroom that did not belong to people like me.  Then you can talk about learning the people are the similar, maturity, differences between men and women, etc. etc.  idk just an idea.  people like humor and it is a good attention grabber.  humor is a good link into a serious topic.<br>  <br>  pick one and run with it, or pick a few and think about how they all change who you are for the better or worse.  how turning points give people character and experience in life.  brings people together or pushes them apart.<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|JeVxDmfYaa	is that a book or a movie or something.. sorry never heard off.. but let me google it and i might have some ideas for you..|`|yQFHoEqxaa	Turning points in a person's life: <br>  <br>  Having a child<br>  Going off to college for the first time<br>  Realizing there is no bogeyman under your bed (hehe)<br>  Falling in love for the first time<br>  A death of someone close to you<br>  Turning 30, or 40, or 50, etc...aging, i guess<br>  High School Graduation<br>  Bankruptcy<br>  Failing at something important to you, i.e., getting into that one college you wanted<br>  <br>  You don't have to actually have experienced these, you can interview someone who has, or you can make a speech that makes your audience think about turning points. For example, "Falling in love for the first time can be considered an important turning point in a person's life. Most first loves don't last, and from the pain and sadness suffered from a first heartbreak, many important lessons are learned, and a person's character is developed."  and so on and so forth blah blah balh<br>  <br>  That's a really rough example, but you get the idea, right?

I will be talking about "Turning Points."<br>  <br>  P.S.

For example, as someone getting on, I am frequently at a loss listening to teenagers chatting due to the fact that they seem to have a set of vocabulary where my understanding of the meaning is completely different to theirs - e.g. wicked, cool etc. <br>  Good luck with your study and presentation.

But would probably read like this victim was found faced up with contusions around neck and throat.<br>  <br>  A physical examination is done first before an autopsy which means if a M.E. can't find the cause of death on the outside such as poison, etc then they do the autopsy which would go like this-Female is 5'11 weight is 115LB time of death was around 12 hrs ago cause of death is a broken neck consisting of the 3rd and 4th vertebrae has some bruising on the left arm from her attacker etc. Get the picture.<br>   Manner of death?

Courses without any math tend to be the ones that also don't lead directly to any jobs - like English, history, anthropology, sociology, religion, art, theater, dance, music.  Avoiding math eliminates the high-paying choices - medicine, science, math, engineering, nursing, architecture, business, finance.|`|0WASp0bHaa	No matter what your major is going to be, you will have to take math in college.

g25k21fAaa	When making reference to the Bible, it should always be capitalised so that people know that you are referring to the Bible and not just any biblio, ie book.<br>  <br>  God and Holy Ghost should also always be capitalised as they are titles/names (depending on what you prefer). Always.<br>  <br>  By capitalising these, then people will know exactly who you are referring to - even if you don't believe. It's like capitalising the M on Mr or Mrs, or capitalising the first letter of your name. If the first letter of your name is not capitalised, it could potentially be regarded as an insult. But in this case, it just makes it clear to whom you are referring to. If you are just talking about 'a god' or 'a ghost' that just happens to be holy, they do no need to be capitalised, as they are now objects/nouns, not names/titles.|`|car4UyLFaa	It's a body of literary work, so yes it should be capitalized.|`|128ac88ebed63144dd0d2d177b2adb74aa	All names have a capital including the names of books.<br>  <br>  ~Lord Wafflemire~|`|z7lTBWkYaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7MH1aPTEQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7MH1aPT...</a>|`|WJXzna8xaa	Yes.

AqrjG7tvaa	I think the system in Australia might be a little different, so I'm not sure how helpful this response will be.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of courses in highschool that are compulsory, even though they might be completely irrelevant to your future career.  If you know what that's going to be.<br>  <br>  A lot of students have no idea what they want to do, so having a variety of courses as a part of the curriculum can be instrumental in helping them decide what their interests are.<br>  And I don't think it really needs to be said that a variety of courses in highschool helps create a well-rounded person.  What I love about the Australian university system is that you only study what you want - there's no compulsory English or literature or arts to do.<br>  <br>  In short - highschool isn't a waste of time, but all the other courses might seem a little pointless to those students who know where they want to go in life.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps a little mate ;)|`|2TIFeiUEaa	yes it is...I cant think of one thing besides reading, writing, and math, that I learned in my entire school life.

szyrw5P0aa	just start talking like you were in a middle of a conversion.|`|jygcvFAMaa	here's some tips:<br>  WIFM. While listening to your speech, your audience wants to know “What’s In it For Me?” Select a topic THEY care about. Give them the information they want to know. <br>  Do you Care? Select a topic you care about. If you select a topic that doesn’t interest you, how is it supposed to interest your audience? Your enthusiasm for the subject will be expressed through your speech. <br>  What Do You Know? Each of us has our own niche of expertise. Don’t start from scratch. Select a topic that you already know something about. Keep an inventory of subjects you have knowledge about for future reference. <br>  Timing is Everything. Consider your time constraints. If you’ve been asked to give a 15-minute presentation, be sure that your topic can be explained in the time allotted. Your passion may be Euclidian Geometry and your audience’s idea of a good time involves fun filled weekends of proofs, but 15 minutes would not be enough time to illuminate the fascinating world of Geometry. <br>  Brainstorm. Brainstorming is a great way to get the creative juices flowing and can be accomplished in 4 easy steps. Step one: Take out a piece of paper and pen. Step two: Stop thinking. Step three: Write down anything and everything that comes to mind. Don’t evaluate what you’re writing—just start writing. If you find yourself staring at a blank piece of paper, then go back to step two–STOP THINKING. Step four: Go back though your list and evaluate ideas. Look for connections or ideas that fit well together. You can use this list as a springboard to finding the right topic for you and your audience. <br>  Fold Laundry. If you’re stuck for ideas, get up and do something else for a while. You may find the less you think about an idea, the easier it will come to you. I’ve had some of my best ideas with me.<br>  <br>  That's all, i hope'd it helped! :)

AA10276327	On the lighter side:<br>  - As our alphabet now stands, the bad spelling, or what is called so, is generally the best, as conforming to the sound of the letters and the words. -- Benjamin Franklin<br>  <br>  I don't see any use in spelling a word right, and never did. I mean I don't see any use in having a uniform and arbitrary way of spelling words. We might as well make all our clothes alike and cook all dishes alike. - Mark Twain<br>  <br>  I have no respect for a man who doesn't know more than one way to spell a word - Walt Whitman<br>  <br>  As far as YA goes, there are a number of non-English speakers here who are trying to learn the language.

And also my niece, who is 13 reads a lot of books, and has done all her life, I have her on my Facebook and she still conforms to use text language on there. But she's a very intelligent girl.

What I would say is that I am the kind of person that enjoys things to be aesthetically pleasing, that I enjoy having things in order. Perhaps I am  a little OCD in this respect. <br>  <br>  One has to understand that many people are just finding the quickest way to get their point across, as mentioned in one of the posts previously. I think it's just a matter of laziness - people just need to get into the habit of writing correctly. <br>  <br>  Of course, there are tools out there for people who cannot spell (up to this point, I have made 4 spelling errors :) ) I use Firefox with an Australian-English Dictionary integrated, and proof-read what I have written before I post. <br>  <br>  In conclusion, it's just a matter of training people to write correctly, 100% of the time; instead of just writing Standard English when it suits them.

ixmaM395aa	Painting!!! An all round favorite of kids from 2-8yrs old! Take them for a journey out to the mall and go to a craft store. Let them each pick two colors of paint and brush each and a big piece of paper. Then take them home, set them up where it won't matter if they make a little mess, kitchen or bathroom as they're tiled and tell them to paint a picture for their parents. You can even paint with them if you want. <br>  <br>  Oh and the whole point of them picking two colors each is so they can share without it costing too much!|`|bm8Ano1Naa	maybe you can go to a indoor park (if you have there) or maybe you can go like shopping centre but go to the children area so that the children will enjoy but if you want you can just play around inside your house.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	If you see a cat in a hat, hide and call the police.<br>  <br>  Edit--<br>  <br>  Dr. Seuss?

74935bb8e45f026d8f222b3b74cffd8faa	Err... drop the thesaurus. Remunerated? You were paid for your essay in "Race and Family"? "Tauntingly"? Do your classmates actually make fun of you? If so, that's a point that should be explained in itself. If that's not what you mean, don't say it. Is the mix really "volatile"? That makes you sound emotionally unstable, not going to help your case.<br>  <br>  Using lots of big words doesn't make you sound smarter, especially if you don't use them quite right. Use a thesaurus sparingly, and only use a word if you're sure it conveys the message you mean. Synonyms can have different connotations.<br>  <br>  Also--if this petition is being made to the teacher who's actually teaching the class, don't accuse him of grading your papers unfairly (which is what you're doing basically when you say you got better grades on your writing in the other class). And even if it's not being addressed to him, it's not going to help your case. <br>  <br>  Suggestion for 1st paragraph:<br>  <br>  I am petitioning to drop sociology 100-01 because I am struggling to grasp the abstract concepts of the class. I have increased my studying [and sought help at the tutoring center]*, yet my grade continues to fall.  I would not like to risk my GPA in a class whose difficulty and time commitment far outweigh its pertinence to my major. Since sociology is not directly related to my major or career aspirations (finance, accounting, pre-med), and since I am getting social science credits for another class I am taking entitled "Race and Family," I don’t see how withdrawing from this class would be a problem.<br>  <br>  *bracketed part: If that's true, say it. If not, don't, obviously.<br>  <br>  See how much clearer that sounds? And without dumbing it down.|`|EamhENYJaa	If you are having trouble with it, why don't you ask the teacher for help or get a tutor ? Why are you giving up ? <br>  If you are just dropping it to save your grades then just say that is the reason.|`|AA12393475	I can't believe you have to write out a reason to withdraw a class, I attended ASU and they never asked you for a reason.

It is derived from ventriculography, an earlier and more primitive one where the air is injected through holes drilled in the skull.<br>  <br>  The procedure was introduced in 1919 by the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy.<br>  <br>  Pneumoencephalography was performed extensively throughout the late 20th century, but it was extremely painful and, as researchers would later discover, very dangerous. The test was generally not well tolerated by patients. Headaches and severe vomiting were common side effects. Replacement of the spinal fluid was by natural generation and therefore required recovery for as long as 2-3 months before normal movement was restored. Modern imaging techniques such as MRI and Computed tomography[1] have largely replaced Pneumoencephalography.<br>  <br>  By the late 1980s the procedure was largely abandoned by the medical community, having been supplanted by the CT scan and metrizamide cisternography. Today, pneumoencephalography is limited to the research field and is used under rare circumstances. A related procedure is pneumomyelography, where gas is used similarly to investigate the spinal canal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pneumoencephalography appears in popular culture in the movie The Exorcist (1973), when Linda Blair's Regan McNeil character undergoes the procedure."
2pNHOCONaa	oh my. i used to have that same exact problem in highschool.. even through college. i never even finished college because i couldnt concentrate.<br>  <br>  so were probably on the same level, and i absolutely understand what youre going through. my mom would look into my notebooks before and see that i dont have notes from class, instead she finds sketches of the back of my classmates heads! it was a problem.. i couldnt even finish reading a book.<br>  <br>  but heres the best part, i can finish doing what i need to do Now. i have read so many books that i started when before i never could. its Attention. the key is attention. you need to be aware of your thoughts. if its getting you places you know you dont need to go, STOP it. the more aware you are of what youre thinking? the more you will have control over them. you are not your thoughts and emotions. those are separate from you, did you know that? who you are is what you choose to do about those thoughts and emotions! :) so you need to be more aware so you can separate them as soon as you recognize them.<br>  <br>  The Art Of Memory Is The Art Of Attention.-unknown<br>  <br>  you need to realize what Presence of Mind means. and you need to practise it soon. it means beaing in the present. living in the Now. not imagining what tomorrow is gonna be. my dad is actually the same way. he does not see whats going on around him. when we talk to him, we think hes listening, but his mind is wandering. this is a problem :c<br>  and i hope you learn from our mistakes and realize that you are in control. not your thoughts that go day dreaming, but You.<br>  <br>  and common rule of thumb says that any difficult new habit becomes second nature after only three weeks! so be optimistic. keep at it, and before you know it, youll be smoothsailing :) Goodluck!|`|yYmHr93Gaa	Get some peace...Study!!<br>  <br>  Concentrate...Dont have things around you which will allow you to be distracted.

Ensure you have a quiet place to study<br>  <br>  2. Make sure you have all necessary materials for the study session within reach. <br>  <br>  3. Do not accept any phone calls from anyone during your set study session. <br>  <br>  4. Have a clear goals set for the study session. Be very specific and realistic as to what you can complete. In fact. set the bar so low that you are almost sure you will achieve that goal. For example, you know you have to answer 7 questions. You know you can answer 3 in one hour. That is your goal for the session. This motivates you to concentrate on achieving this goal because you know you have 100% chance of success. Naturally, you will succeed. Great! You did well, pat yourself on your shoulders. Now, the next step is to answer 2 bonus questions because you are so brilliant. Again, make sure that you have a good chance of achieving those two bonus questions. Success breeds success and motivation. <br>  <br>  4. When you have all your study session goal's set out, sit back on your chair, close your eyes and breath slowly and deeply. Focus your mind to exist only in the NOW. The here and now is important. Call it your Zone of success. Open your eyes and start working within that calm and concentrated Zone. <br>  <br>  This works wonders for me. Give it a try and you are likely to find that it will work for you as well. <br>  <br>  Be sure to end each study session with success. It builds confidence and motivation. Study will become something to look forward to. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|mjy4oRvDaa	Losing your concentration when doing an important task can be extremely frustrating.

yJSPecgoaa	The way I read your question, I thought your concern about how long homeschooling takes each day was rooted in concern for your *parents* and their tight schedules.  (Would that more 13-year olds were as considerate of their parents.)<br>  <br>  A common misconception of homeschooling is that the institutional classroom becomes the model for the home school, complete with 7-hour days and parent-as-teacher standing at the head of the "class"  giving out assignments and orders.  Although some homeschool families may choose to re-create the typical institutional classroom in their homes, it really isn't necessary.  Nor is it necessary (or possibly even healthy) for a parent to be watching over every move a young homeschooled teenager makes while they are studying.<br>  <br>  Most of the home schooled children I know at your age are fairly independent.  They know what they have to do, and if they get stuck, they know where to go (often right online) to get UN-stuck.  Depending on the curriculum you choose, an online tutor may even be available on an "as needed" basis, when you get stuck on a math problem, for example.<br>  <br>  Before approaching your parents. it is best that you FIRST become informed yourself on homeschooling.  Go to <a href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/inde...</a> and read the topics under "Beginning to Homeschool."  This way, you'll have a better idea of what will be involved, both from your standpoint and from that of your parents. <br>  <br>  You don't say what state you live in, but the homeschooling laws vary quite a bit from state to state. The site I gave you above can also help you with understanding what your own state's homeschooling laws are.  BEFORE you approach your parents, it's good to have at least a general idea of what sort of compliance responsibilities your parents will have.<br>  <br>  Now for approaching your parents, once you've read a bit more about homeschooling.  Tell them in a serious and calm way (with not a single trace of pleading or whining) that you have come to realize, more than ever before, how absolutely essential an education is in our society.  Go on to explain that you are concerned that you are not learning anywhere near as much as you think you ought to be in school, and that it is mainly due to all the distractions and so forth that surround you at school.  Tell them very sincerely that you want to SUCCEED in your schooling and learn as much as you possibly can.  Then tell them that because you find you learn best with the fewest possible distractions,  you have researched the idea of homeschooling.  You can then present to them what is involved, based on your research, and reassure them that you yourself will be bearing the greatest amount of responsibility, and that you *welcome* whatever responsibility that is.  Try to convey to them that you are really, really excited about the prospect of learning and making the sort of progress you *want* to make, but are currently held back from making,  given the circumstances at school (classroom distractions and disruptions, for example).<br>  <br>  Only if your parents see that you have approached this matter maturely and responsibly are they likely to be receptive to your proposal.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best of luck.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	Don't listen to 'lovin'. Home schooling is NOT a sclaker's gig. Home schooling provides a safer environment than any public school. And he's not trying to get out of work! Don't be so jumpy to conclusions, he may be suffering from bullying or abuse at school, don't be so judgmental.<br>  <br>  Each home schooling day varies, depending on subjects, and length of assignments, and the amount of time taken to complete each subject.<br>  <br>  It averages around a few hours a day. Hey ask your parents, you can even independently do the work, they just give you everything you need for the day, and then just do it.|`|TB8rfMrHaa	First of all, it sounds as if you are trying to get out of doing work!  Home schooling is anything, but a slacker's gig!  You must be willing to work hard and not have to have someone nagging over your shoulder all day.  You must be diligent and willing to complete your work on time w/o being checked up on.<br>  ***If you work hard and fast . . . maybe 2-4 hrs per day.<br>  <br>  Personally you don't sound like you're ready!  Not to mention the added work for your parents.|`|jtmXnJf4aa	Well, you're thirteen, so I would like to think you can handle some independent time while your parents are at work. But, since I do not know you personally, let's go on the safe side and assume someone is going to be checking up on you...<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is find out what the homeschooling laws are in your area. Please view the following link to find this information:<br>  <a href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/directory/Legalities.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/dire...</a><br>  <br>  Once you know what your state expects of you, you can branch off into figuring out a lesson plan for yourself, as well as know if it would be easier to do "school in a box", belong to an umbrella organization or charter school, or go completely DIY (do it yourself). Based on this criteria, your "school day" can last only a couple hours, though most of us homeschoolers like to believe we are always learning! :)<br>  <br>  I believe if you can track down all of this information for your parents and discuss your thoughts and ideas in an adult manner, your chances of becoming a homeschooler will greatly increase.|`|hH4WUq5Naa	about 2-3 hours a day. but depends on how much work your teachers want you to send in each week or day.

"Young Goodman Brown" poignantly proves that consideration as Hawthorne masterfully paints a picture of a man filled with doubt and deceit.  Goodman Brown is a Puritan, and outwardly, he presents himself as a man of conscience and duty.  Yet, secretly, he harbors thoughts which are considered sinful, and eventually lead him to the meeting with the Devil.  The story is filled with symbolic meanings, as characters represent not just people but also human inner strengths and weaknesses.|`|6GULDLO1aa	First things first shouldn't use ?cutely (second line)  its not a "small" fact its quite an accomplishing characteristic...try replacing acutely with (Furthermore or More over).

i5tOQGgFaa	Daily practice...you can search "sight word" activities on the internet and then change those ideas to include the number words instead of the other more typical sight words.<br>  <br>  I've found that the more active the learning the quicker they'll learn and they are more apt to retain the information.<br>  <br>  *  Sidewalk chalk on the driveway...make a hopscotch board or an icecream cone and instead of writing the numerals in each spot...write the numeral word and have him say/yell/sing each one he hops on.<br>  <br>  *  write the numeral words on paper shapes and attach to a wall and allow him to toss a bean bag at each one and tell you which he it.<br>  <br>  * www.childcareland.com has some numeral word/numeral matching free printables.  I make them a bit smaller and cut out and laminate and add velcro.  Then I hide the numeral word strips in a sensory material- styrofoam, paper crinkles, foam pieces, etc and they go digging and match the word to the number.<br>  <br>  *  Inside of a plastic egg place letter manipulatives (magnet letters) to make each number.  Write the numeral on the egg and then have him "crack" the egg and spell out the number.<br>  <br>  *  On one end of a craft stick write the numeral on the other end write the numeral word.  Place the craft sticks into a container word down.  Have him pull out a craft stick, look at the numeral, and write the word down and check his work.  You can write on a window/sliding glass door with washable marker, in a sand try, etc.  It doesn't have to be paper and pencil!<br>  <br>  *  have the numeral names on one side of a piece of paper and add stickers or stamps or do a dot markers and have him read the word and then stamp out that many dots next to it.  You can do it on small pieces of paper and staple together to make a book.<br>  <br>  *  provide a pile of blocks and numeral word cards.  Can make it self-checking by writing the numeral on the back.

g25k21fAaa	Haharr!! I love writing stories, howbeit I've only just recently realised that to be a good writer, you need to be able to write a good short story, not just any blah story that goes on forever... sorry, I'm rambling. <br>  <br>  Some ideas? I'll sure loooove to help ya, but depends which way you're bent... as in what types of stories you prefer. Humour, symbolic, serious, dark, your choice... good versus evil blah.<br>  <br>  Romantic style... which by the way, could be almost anything!<br>  People fall in love, get married/ don't get married, tragic ending/ happily ever after<br>  Beauty and beast style:<br>  Hero/heroine is either the beauty or the beast. Hate each other's guts, or so afraid of the other that they faint all the time. Situation forces them to get together and spend time together. They see something in the other person they didn't notice before. Ladedah, you know how it goes.<br>  <br>  Fantasy style<br>  Erm... this can be anything. Another world, different social rules and priorities, dancing unicorns, anime style?<br>  <br>  Swashbuckler style<br>  Reminds one of the pirate of carribean type. Save the lady in distress! Here comes the knight in shining armour! Whoops! Clumsy pirate ho! Look out below! You know, very action oriented. Oh no! she's been kidnapped AGAIN!<br>  <br>  Dead hero who makes the ultimate sacrifice style<br>  Can go with romantic hero, swashbuckler...<br>  <br>  Random style<br>  Ok... this is hard to explain, but I'll give a short example off the top of my head.<br>  <br>  The onion wanted everyone to look at him. He wanted to be great, just like the bright shining lightbulb that the whole house looked up to. Everyday, he cried, because he just could not shine any light, so the lightbulb took pity on him and taught him to reflect light and show the world how beautiful and shiny he was. Unfortunately, the light reflections caused all eyes to be drawn to the onions beauty, resulting in the onion getting made into onion rings to complement the sausages.<br>  <br>  See what I mean? It's random.<br>  <br>  Anti-hero style<br>  Erm, somewhat like my onion above. or um... your main character is portrayed as the hero. All his best aspects, skills, comeliness, manner is shown off... and then you find out that he's actually the villain in the story, and the whole story is about how the villain gets defeated by the good guys, but you end up liking the villain. He is the hero after all, because you like his personality, although you may not like what he did. <br>  <br>  There are sooooooo many styles, you gotta choose your favourite.<br>  <br>  Main thing is: make sure your hero/heroine has CHARACTER! If they don't sound like they could plausibly exist and they aren't showing any real personality, your guy/lady will be a 2D cardboard cut-out... so, the cheat's way (which many many writers use! I assure you!) is to base your character on somebody around you that happens to be larger than life. Base your hero on somebody you admire. Take the admirable qualities and give them to your hero.<br>  <br>  Giant and dwarf<br>  someone betrayed by their best friend and the story is about how they resolve the issue<br>  The rock, the scissors and the paper. Who is stronger? Who is kinder? and therefore the hero?<br>  Travelling over mountains and seas, against all odds, the hero/ heroine battles against the forces of evil to preserve the last remnants of their kingdom's most prized treasure.<br>  <br>  and the list goes on...

Early whaling affected the development of widely disparate cultures–as, for example, in Norway and Japan.[1] Although prehistoric hunting and gathering is generally considered to have had low ecological impact, early whaling in the Arctic altered freshwater ecology.[2] The development of modern whaling techniques was spurred in the 19th century by the increase in demand for whale oil,[3] sometimes known as "train oil" and in the 20th century by a demand for margarine and later whale meat.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] England<br>  The English Muscovy Company was given a monopoly charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1577, and the growth of its whaling fleet was gradual. The primary whaling grounds of this joint-stock company came to be centered around Spitsbergen in the early 17th century.[4] Initially the English tried to drive away competitors; but after a few years, they persisted in claiming only the waters to the south of the archipelago.[5]<br>  <br>  In the mid 1770s, government subsidies for whaling ships flying the English ensign were increased. Import tariffs and other economic restrictions limited access to British harbors for non-British ships and non-English whaling products. This led to a ten-fold increase in the English whaling fleet.[6] These Arctic gains were diminished by the fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784) and the Napoleonic Wars (1795-1802; 1803-1813).[7] In 1816, there were 146 English whaling ships in the coastal waters of the Arctic; and the numbers of English whalers continued to dwindle for the next two decades. In the 1840s, the British government ended its whaling subsidies, ceding the market to the Americans and others.[8]<br>  <br>  This is a taster of what you can find on Wikipedia|`|9YMPSQWCaa	i did this for bio coursework last year.. if your doing the same course as me...<br>  start with why they actually whale... what they use the meat for<br>  then begin to research measures put in place by those that don't agree with whaling, and how effective they are<br>  <br>  you'll find plenty more on the way, email me if you have any problems.. it's easier than you think

Those are grad school topics - MIT is one of the few schools that even offers an undergrad class in GR.  Seeing as how those schools accept less than 5-10% of US applicants, and fewer foreign applicants, your chances aren't good no matter what your credentials are - but that's ok, because you'll need a PhD either way, so you can do your undergrad at pretty much any school that offers physics.

JoyIIiZ6aa	Lord Thomas Elgin was British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and an avid antiquities collector and fancier.  He asked and received permission to enter Parthenon which was a Turkish military fort at the time, and then looted the place wholesale, sending the marble sculptures to Britain by the boatloads. (early 1800s)  His actions were controversial back then, and still remain a source of political discussions and arguments.  It seems that there is no middle ground, and people perceive him either as a thief and a vandal, or as a savior of Greek culture and tradition.  Elgin removed marbles in a somewhat haphazard way, picking the pieces he liked best, and often damaging other structures while taking the parts he wanted.  There is a strong movement supporting Greece's claim to the marbles and demand that they be returned to Parthenon, but there is also just as strong an opposition to it.<br>  You may find this link useful for your homework:<br>  <a href="http://www.parthenonuk.com/who_are_we.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.parthenonuk.com/who_are_we.ph...</a>

tTLGVtLGaa	First, there is an error common to both sentences:<br>  <br>  'Nokia is a good example of company.....', should be, 'Nokia is a good example of a company.....'. Take a look at the link below regarding the use of the indefinite article.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/radio/specials/1521_gramchallenge27/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learni...</a><br>  <br>  Other than that, either sentence is grammatically correct. Sentence 1  suggests that the company is paying much attention to the cultivation of its organizational culture right now (but maybe hasn't done so in the past). Sentence 2 implies that the company pays much attention to the cultivation of its organizational culture all the time/generally/as a rule (including in the past).<br>  <br>  The sentence which is most acceptable depends on the meaning you are trying to convey and therefore the context of the sentence, which you have not provided.|`|I1eR9aULaa	neither is correct english it should be written as <br>  <br>  Nokia is a good example of a company paying alot of attention to the cultivation of its organisational culture.|`|ZCcHS7N5aa	sentence 2 but it needs an a after the of and before company|`|AA11553969	Sentence 2 is close -- very close.<br>  <br>  It needs the article "a" between the words "of" and "company" so that it reads "example of a company"<br>  <br>  You will find that one of the main ways to take the foreign sounds out of speaking or writing in English is the use of the articles "a", "an", and "the" and to use contractions like "that's" rather than "that is".|`|qaacatZzaa	sentence 3: Nokia is a good example of a company that pays much attention to the cultivation of its organizational culture.<br>  <br>  Or what dude above me said, except spelled correctly. :D Cheers.<br>  <br>  And what the girl below me said.
CCkeHYw7aa	Wonderful!|`|5c85d17cf24e7425bd40998e49a6e30aaa	It's grammatically correct, but you could tighten it up by saying something like:<br>  <br>  *Nokia is a good example of a company that pays attention to cultivating its organizational culture.<br>  <br>  *Nokia is a good example of a company focused on cultivating its organizational culture.|`|rgPmkqwXaa	Very acceptable!|`|1ZU5IP0vaa	Although my english is not that good, but the sentence has no problem and when i read it it does not sound strange at all.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Strong organizational culture is said to exist where staff respond to stimulus because of their alignment to organizational values. In such environments, strong cultures help firms operate like well-oiled machines, cruising along with outstanding execution and perhaps minor tweaking of existing procedures here and there.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Nokia is a good example of a company that pays a lot of attention to its organizational culture.<br>  <br>  (changed paying to that pays or which pays and cultivation and culture is redundant, so one must go)<br>  <br>  A good  example of a company that pays a lot of attention to its organizational culture, is Nokia.<br>  <br>  (I don't like "pays a lot of attention to"  = promotes, dedicates ??)|`|qEn157Ppaa	I would change one word, cultivation, to growth. Only for the simple reason that the ending of the sentence would flow better. Instead of  "the cultivation of its organizational culture" I think it sounds better writing "the growth of its organizational culture."
IW0JOg9eaa	find another word for culture, skills, is probably a better word, otherwise it's ok.|`|mBgi9fdwaa	A company that has no organizational traits cannot be as competitive compared to those with such traits. hope this will help you.
orRJdm0maa	You could either drop an AS next year and pick another one up - Does your college do Fashion design?<br>  OR<br>  You could do a foundation course at uni in Fashion Design. A foundation course is for a year and you are guaranteed a place at that uni on a course of your choice. This may not be possible for every uni - so you are going to have to look into it. I know Lancashire's university does foundation courses if that helps! x|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	Go and talk to someone at your college. Basically there is a time period from when you start college and when you're allowed to change or drop courses. The time period is like 2 months. So I'd highly doubt you will be able to change your courses. They're probably advise you to stick with the course you are doing, then take art and design next year from Sept. Or, they could give you evening classes as well as classes in college time, so you can catch up, although it be very hard.<br>  <br>  Xx|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	unfortunately, you would need art.<br>  <br>   a possible way round it is study the art Alevel as an evening class at your local college. talk to <a href="http://www.connexions-direct.com/index.cfm?go=Careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.connexions-direct.com/index.c...</a><br>  <br>   they can advise you.
d62ec4b0ec79c4b628be4464b2d06733aa	Call the school!|`|8443dcf01e697987812523d32f90fd07aa	In a public school you will need a teacher certification - which will require a BA and student teaching. During student teaching you will receive no income for 16 weeks unless you work nights (VERY difficult during student teaching). States offer different options for the certification. Some offer Early Childhood Ed which is birth through age 8 (third grade) that would let you teach K, but some only offer Elementary (K-6). Both are different than the degree in Child & Family Development that many schools offer. While it also trains you to work with young children, it does NOT certify you to teach above preschool. <br>  <br>  Another option is to find out if any of your local public schools offer a preschool program on-site. Its a growing trend and many schools are piloting preschool programs. Not sure if they would require you to be degreed or certified, but you get the same benefits as a public school teacher and would most likely earn quite a bit more than you do now.<br>  <br>  I would suggest contacting a school and asking to "shadow" a K teacher for a day to see what a typical work day is like. Mention to them that you work in early childhood ed as a preschool teacher and are considering pursuing teacher certification. I assume that you are required by your preschool to have a criminal background check and TB test on file. You might mention this to them as their volunteers & employees must have these. <br>  <br>  Also, some larger preschools offer tuition reimbursement for teachers intending to become degreed or certified. If yours does not, there are also several scholarships from ECE professional organizations at the state and national level that might help you with the financial aspect of continued schooling. Best of luck!

GjmtdrUnaa	When you apply for college, they request an official HIGH SCHOOL transcript. Your middle school grades aren't on there.<br>  <br>  Middle school is preparation for high school, which is preparation for college.<br>  <br>  Colleges are only concerned with how you well prepared for college, not how well you prepared to prepare for college, haha.<br>  <br>  Don't stress about your middle school grades. I had terrible middle school grades. I got straight As in high school and at my college interviews they brought up my straight As. So clearly, they did not look at my middle school grades.<br>  <br>  Make sure you practice for and take the SATs. That is way more important than middle school grades.<br>  <br>  Also, get involved with a bunch of clubs.<br>  <br>  Colleges don't just look at grades.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XGsuxRR2aa	Your GPA for high school is something that colleges will want to know when you apply for them, So yes, they will matter, 9 - 12 matters.<br>  <br>  If you want more information, ask teachers at your school, or perhaps the councilor and people such as that, they will know more.|`|xfFdYiWlaa	no and yes dpends if your going to a major univesity dude<br>  honnestly preety sure thell back track<br>  <br>  high school<br>  thats were it all happens<br>  dude dont mess up freshmen year<br>  thats when every thing matters i promise<br>  once you fall behinde there i promise almost inpposbile<br>  to come back<br>  dont let any one tell you freshmen year doest count<br>  thats the most inportant one<br>  its your start<br>  <br>  dont mess up like me man <br>  im 17 and down a thousand credits
hAFxcxP0aa	Read books. Go to the nearest library (local or school library) and read books at a very low level. Progress your way up. <br>  <br>  Each time you read a book write down the main idea and the main issue. Summarise the stroy into your own words and then check the spelling three times over. Underline anything that seems to be spelt wrong. Show your teacher, sister, brother or parents if you spelt those words write. Get someone to mark these papers each time.<br>  <br>  Do this each time you read a book and slowly work your way up to a high reading level. You will get better and better, trust me.<br>  <br>  Ask people such as friends or family how their day was. Listen carefully, go back to your room or somewhere quiet and write about their day.

And the best models to read are the bible, Shakespeare, and Abraham Lincoln.<br>  <br>  1. The bible, quite apart from its content, is a model for English prose because of its rhetorical tropes. It is full of parallelism (the use of parallel structures in English) and balance--sentences that use phrases of approximately the same length that create a sense of order and clarity. Most English prose strives for these effects. They were first and most tellingly incarnated in the bible.<br>  <br>  2. Shakespeare's poetry and prose is the richest there is in terms of linguistic variety and the imaginative use of metaphor. All language is metaphorical in nature; the writer, in my experience, in English who makes fullest use of this trait is Shakespeare.<br>  <br>  It's better to know one or two plays that you really like well than to try to read all of him. Even if it's _Titus Andronicus_ or _The Taming of the Shrew_ (two of Shakespeare's poorest), Shakespeare will serve you well.<br>  <br>  If Shakespeare is beyond you, it's better to know one or two books well--_Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ or _Pride and Prejudice_-- and these can serve as models too.<br>  <br>  3. Abraham Lincoln, in my judgment, is the greatest writer of expository prose, of casual prose, or writing memos and letters. He is never pretentious, always to the point, and embodies in humbler contexts the virtues of the bible and Shakespeare. There may be other models such as Addison and Steele that will also work, but Lincoln is not daunting and can be read in snatches.|`|7syRjSZwaa	Any language you go for learning you need to practice everyday. Like our mother tongue, we everyday speak at home or with relatives with our mother language. So we are familiar to that language.<br>  <br>  But if we are learning a new language we need to first listen the language properly with correct grammar so we start thinking on that language. <br>  <br>  Like English, if you start thinking in English everyday you will speak the same. So try to think more in English and speak. <br>  <br>  The more you will think in English, the more you will speak in English.<br>  <br>  For listening start listening English songs or listen news in English.. When you are familier to the correct pronounciation of words, you will develop your listening skills.<br>  <br>  You can also visit to the following link for your reference.|`|JJKcLcflaa	I would suggest to improve ones english you read a lot of books. Going to the library is a good idea to build up your speaking skills and listening. Another good idea is that you could go online to chat to people as normal this way you could improve alot of speaking and listening.<br>  <br>  I used to know a lot of people with this problem and they followed some of these techniques and did improve. See how you get on.<br>  <br>  Hope  i've been of help and goes well all the best.|`|4PcxcCVPaa	Read anything by Winston Churchill and Charles Dickens.  Kurt Vonnegut is great also.
dcRFtckyaa	- Promotes patriotism, so people feel good about their country and generally complain less about taxes.<br>  - Promotes unity, so people stop arguing with different ethnic groups and embrace the fact that they're stuck on the same piece of land for the rest of the foreseeable future.<br>  - Promotes tradition, so those with conservative views will stay happy. Also, it's a bit late to change things now.<br>  - Makes people feel proud about their country. Helpful in war recruitment propaganda. Also gives politicians the "I'm doing this for the good of the country" excuse.<br>  <br>  In a way, it's a form of brainwashing really.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! xx

Esto dejo de ocurrir cuando cumplí 10 a?os.<br>  <br>  Ahora que soy una persona mayor me doy cuenta que mis padres jamas vieron que el problema real no era que fuera una ni?a cochina, simplemente era mi manera de llamar la atención, de decir ehhh aquí estoy, también necesito de su atención.<br>  <br>  Entiendo a tu ni?a y yo te pido que por favor NO LA REGA?ES, trata mejor de ver que es lo que ella te esta queriendo decir.|`|5da51c8caae44fa57a596c7af2a20517aa	Consultaste con su medico??<br>  Te preguntaste si en tu casa, o en su escuela esté pasando algo y ella te quiera llamar la atencion de esta manera??

AA10540268	Bacteria and viruses vary greatly in size- bacteria can be anywhere from 10 to 100 times larger than viruses. Basically, bacteria contain everything for them to reproduce- genetic information in the form of DNA or RNA, ribosomes (necessary for translating the genetic information into enzymes required for its survival), and plasmids which convey extra genetic information for a variety of purposes (bacterial "sex" for example- bacteria normally reproduce asexually, but with certain plasmids genetic material can be passed between bacteria). Viruses, on the other hand, generally only have genetic information, have no way of replicating that information and also lack the machinery needed for making its own proteins. They need to infiltrate living cells to be able to reproduce. You may have seen pictures of viruses looking like moon-landers- the legs attach onto the surface of the cell, then the genetic material contained inside the head of the virus is injected into the cell. This genetic material can either use the cell's machinery to produce its own proteins and/or virus bits, or it can be integrated into the cell's DNA/RNA and then translated later. When enough "baby" viruses are produced the cell bursts, releasing the new viral particles.<br>  <br>  They also differ in structure- bacteria have cell walls (in addition to their cell membranes), which contain peptidoglycan polymers and provide structural definition. Another answer mentioned the fact that antibiotics can kill bacteria but not viruses. This is because many antibiotics interfere with the production of peptidoglycans for cell walls. Viruses contain a simple protein coat on the outside. They lack peptidoglycans, therefore are not affected by antibiotics.|`|2f30b86ae700e5bb5bfa748fff29cb7faa	viruses cause more harm and arent able to kill them...bacteria you can kill and isnt as harmful|`|AA10745195	Viruses are very small parasitic non living protein/dna/rna "capsules" that often cause desease.<br>  <br>  Bacteria are larger unicellular living prokaryotic microorganisms.

cMZEmpp0aa	Not if you're smart about your preparations. Many colleges (including very good ones) not only accept but actively recruit homeschoolers. <br>  <br>  Prospective college students need to prove that they can handle college-level work and that they would contribute something to the college community. You can do that in a lot of ways: through SAT or ACT scores, with a transcript of your high-school level coursework, with a transcript of community college classes, and through participating in a wide variety of extra-curricular activities. It's not the old days anymore, when homeschoolers had to struggle and jump through hoops like trained seals to prove themselves. These days, colleges WANT homeschooled students and homeschoolers have no problem getting into colleges and getting scholarships, grants, and loans to pay for school.<br>  <br>  Kenneth F, I am exceedingly grateful that you are NOT a college admissions director (or a college admissions counselor, or anyone else connected with college admission for that matter), because from your answer to this question and others in this forum it's obvious to me that you have no clue what you are talking about when it comes to homeschooling. Get the facts before you pass judgment.|`|yJSPecgoaa	Many colleges welcome home schooled students, including Harvard and MIT, both of whom have a long history of admitting home schooled students.<br>  <br>  It is not necessarily harder to get in to college as a home schooled student.  Home schooled students tend to outperform others on the SAT and the ACT (possibly, I think, because they can devote more time to preparing for such tests).<br>  <br>  College is often easier for home schooled students because they are used to learning independently and knowing how best to budget their time.  Colleges now recognize and appreciate this in home schooled applicants.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	No, it is not harder to enroll in college if you are homeschooled.<br>  <br>  Homeschoolers can submit transcripts, ACT and/or SAT scores, and anything else necessary.  While a diploma is not necessary (for even a public schooled child), homeschoolers can submit those as well.<br>  <br>  Some colleges are actively recruiting homeschoolers, because they have a reputation of easily matriculating because their education more closely resembles the learning style in college.  Homeschoolers are eligible for scholarships as well.<br>  <br>  What does make a difference is your grades, community service, test scores, extra curricular activities and the like-same as with students schooled in a public or private setting, though.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	No, it certainly won't. Some colleges only require a high school diploma, some require the SAT. You can take the SAT at any public/private school, or by a certified evaluator.|`|uuK5lYsjaa	Not necessarily. It depends on what kind of student you are.|`|rXInAcURaa	No, not at all. You are actually more likely to get into it, my 3 sisters were all homeschooled and enrolled in Harvard Law.|`|6fVzzNhiaa	My first thought is, harder than what?  Over the years I've read many mainstream articles about college admissions, and one of the common threads in all the articles is the difficulty regularly-schooled applicants have in standing out from the crowd.  So many stellar school students apply to premier colleges that it's almost as if acceptance personnel have to flip a coin to decided between 'This 5.0gpa, student council pres., cheerleader, National Honor Society, Volunteer of the Year' and 'That 5.0gpa, football captain, Beta Club Pres., Eagle Scout, Olympic team semi-finalist.'  Both applicants have worked hard and excelled, but yet there may be only 1 opening.  How do the admissions personnel choose?<br>  <br>  ... and if homeschooling continues to be popular, it may get that way for those applicants as well.  ;><br>  <br>  As it is, college admissions aren't completely standardized, so a lot about the admissions process depends on the school.  Still, with a 'homeschool transcript' and a comprehensive curriculum vitae (a description of how the teen spent that last 4 years or so) or a reasonable score on a standardized test, homeschooled applicants to colleges are readily accepted.<br>  <br>  One sticking point might be if the credit hours on the homeschooled transcript don't quite match the requirements of the school ... because independent learners move through the material more quickly.  If a person speeds through a text, then the clock-hours won't quite make it to the credit hour cut-off.  In that case, many colleges may accept an explanation of why the clock-hours fell short if the standardized test score validates the claim.<br>  <br>  The same goes for lab courses.  If a teen volunteers in a clinic, that time can (even if it happens after 'graduation') can be counted as lab course time.<br>  <br>  For academically-inclined people who want to minimize these surprises, it might be a good idea to look at the admissions requirements of colleges that the teen would like to attend, and work to meet those requirements.<br>  <br>  All paths to greater competency require work, regardless of whether the path is a common way to go about 'getting there,' or a more unusual way (say, public schooling as compared to homeschooling).  It all depends on where you want to invest your time and energy in 'getting there.'|`|9Ute4yidaa	If your home schooled, its easier to make it to college. :) They usually like you better.
AA11453828	So in space astronauts can function normally|`|AA10104730	Um. We don't.

Over the years, researches have found that humans in space over longer periods of time in zero-gravity conditions experienced considerable bone density reduction to the point of the bones actually being brittle, like an old person suffering from osteoporosis.  Gravity helps the body insure proper circulation, bone density and weight distribution for normal muscle activity which promotes a more normal existence.|`|AA11715950	cuz reality sux|`|AA12326852	In outer space where gravity is low, our bones and muscle will slowly loss the strength.

Over time human muscles deteriate from lack of gravity. (yes you get exersice by just existing on Earth)  So after long travel in space return to any gravity enviroment would kill someone.  Crush them if you will.  They would be unable to breath.

Of course, as an adult everybody will always long for those fun and careless days, but when you don't grow up, you will never experience life in full.

The countries involved all lose some or the majority of fighting age population.  The countries involved experience some degree of population movement, for example, fleeing war torn areas or congregating in metropolitan areas to manufacture war material.  This social movement disrupts culture within geographic areas within a country or countries.  <br>  Economic costs:  countries involved either have their economies severely disrupted or destroyed.  Severe disruption includes going into national debt to pay for war.  Destroyed economies are ones in which the means of production and supply are destroyed.  <br>  Political Costs:  losing countries involved are likely to see their political structure destroyed or minimized..  Winners usually see a significant change immediately after war, for example, Churchill of England was replaced just after World War Two---the winner goes in another political direction.   Also, winning countries governments' may have, due to the war, acquired more social control over their populations. The losing countries, having lost their political structure, may resort to anarchy.|`|yKPsMa2saa	is this some dumb romodel thing?

9x8tOaIyaa	Antibodies which are Y shaped proteins which have specific receptor sites on the arms of the Y. These destroy invading viruses/pathogens by binding to specific protein antigens on their cells.<br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/htbw/_bfs_ISanswers.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/htbw/_bfs_ISan...</a><br>  Lymphocytes<br>  There are two types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells. B cells help make special proteins called antibodies that recognize stuff that shouldn’t be in your body, like bacteria or a virus you get from a sick friend. Antibodies are very specific, and can recognize only a certain type of germ. Once the antibody finds it, it gets rid of the germ so it can’t hurt you.<br>  The really cool part is that even after you are better, B cells can become memory cells that remember how to make the special antibody so that if the same germ infects you again, it can kill the germ even faster! T cells also battle germs that invade the body, but instead of making antibodies, they work by making special chemicals that help fight the infection.<br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/blood.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/blood....</a>
tTLGVtLGaa	They are very closely related but nevertheless separate sentences. One of the common uses of the semi-colon is to link separate yet closely related sentences, so I would probably use a semi-colon in this instance. <br>  <br>  But it's always worth remembering that language is not a science. Some would argue that a comma is more appropriate, while others may even say you should use a full stop. Some may say that the choice of punctuation would depend on where you want to place emphasis. Some would argue that I should not have begun this sentence with the word 'but'.

High school is really quite enjoyable, even the classes, especially compared to college.

You do make new friends at college, but not as quickly as in high school. The schedules are different in college so you don't have classes with almost the same people all the time.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the end of your senior year. Embrace graduation. Take lots of pictures.

74283bab669de6eb8d987f76d05875d1aa	Como já respondi em outro tópico, acho que os professores n?o s?o valorizados atualmente. Antigamente o prof. era um dos profissionais mais valorizados, mais bem pagos e mais respeitados por isso. Hoje a situa??o se inverteu. Hoje, os valores mudaram, as mídias, muitas de péssima qualidade, têm uma enorme influência e, principlamente, porque agora o ter está acima do ser. Para os governantes a principal fun??o do professor é ocupar as crian?as enquanto os pais trabalham e registrar o maior número de alunos para mostrar ao povo, através da mídia, suas estatísticas levando a ele a no??o (falsa) de que está fazendo a sua parte, conforme exige a Constitui??o do Brasil. Os professores, pressionados sempre,  por sua vez est?o extressados, doentes, pois a cada ano recebem mais turmas e com mais alunos cada uma. Por isso n?o podem fazer um acompanhamento individualizado do aluno, como  seria o ideal. Em consequência pela falta de tempo e muito trabalho, muitas vezes n?o podem se reciclar, e nem mesmo cuidar da saúde devidamente, pois também s?o desrespeitados, muitas vezes pela perícia médica.  Como a quest?o principal para a escola tornou-se, agora, a quantidade em vez da qualidade do ensino, o professor, que geralmente é o responsabilizado pelo governo, através dos meios de comunica??o, pela baixa qualidade do ensino se sente, até, desrespeitado pela própria escola e secetarias de educa??o, ou seja professor desvalorizando professor.<br>  <br>  Sugiro que leia as respostas da página Educa??o Referência _ Conhecimentos Gerais, pergunta: Por que a profiss?o de professor está t?o desvalorizada? da pedagoga Josie Lindinha.|`|19c1e3af0215eee00a7eea3aba68dfa4aa	Acho que os bons professores , mas bons no sentindo de saber suas obriga??es como professores, de saber suas responsabilidades esses s?o na sua maioria valorizados.

Assistam programas que aparecem professor, s?o ridicularizados.<br>  Pela mídia de forma geral, n?o. Tratam os professores como coitadinhos.<br>  Depois de toda essa  turma toda dizendo que ser professor é uma quest?o de pena, as famílias acreditam, seus filhos também, e por fim o professor acredita e acaba n?o investindo em si próprio, com forma??o .<br>  Ciclo vicioso.<br>  é necessário acabar com isso.|`|74e1ebd664227fe648f32f8e9cbd5b37aa	No Brasil todo mundo que se forma em curso superior pode ser Professor.

To make it more suitable to your assignment, you could research how this simple concept is used in other modern devices.<br>  <br>  What goes up must come down right?

You'll need the help of some cardboard and a little bit of air pressure.  <br>  <br>  Experience Gravity Free Water <br>  <br>  What you'll need:<br>  <br>  A glass filled right to the top with water <br>  A piece of cardboard <br>  Instructions:<br>  <br>  Put the cardboard over the mouth of the glass, making sure that no air bubbles enter the glass as you hold onto the cardboard. <br>  Turn the glass upside down (over a sink or outside until you get good). <br>  Take away your hand holding the cardboard. <br>  What's happening?<br>  <br>  If all goes to plan then the cardboard and water should stay put. Even though the cup of water is upside down the water stays in place, defying gravity! So why is this happening? With no air inside the glass, the air pressure from outside the glass is greater than the pressure of the water inside the glass. The extra air pressure manages to hold the cardboard in place, keeping you dry and your water where it should be, inside the glass. <br>  <br>  This was borrowed from the science kids website.

UxooffHZaa	If you are inspired by history, get a BA in History. Regardless of major, people with a Bachelor's make twice as much as those people who do not. A BA in History is what is called a liberal arts degree. While you could find a job at a museum, on a historical site, doing digs, or in a library, more likely you'll find yourself in employment that isn't directly effected by your college major. Most go into Business, many go on to earn MBAs, or JDs, Many get education certification and teach. I know a few who went into the police force. Some go into the military, and are able to become officers because they are college graduates. (which is easier with a BA, and next to impossible without) Liberal Arts degrees teach you thinking skills that all companies find desireable. That is why they give BAs preference over people without degrees. In your degree in history, you'll be given perspective other people do not have, and this perspective will be valued on any team you join in the future, whether you find yourself working marketing, military, museums, or mail delivery. :)|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Because it interests you?

While these are still more expensive for international students than they are for domestic students, they are usually the cheapest way to go (and the community colleges in California tend to be inexpensive, compared to others).  Then when you transfer, the economy may be somewhat better again, and also you would have saved considerably on your first two years of college.|`|teqhNlo4aa	Student loans are meant to help students who are unable to bear their educational expenses.

Written in the C++ programming language, CATIA is the cornerstone of the Dassault Systemes product lifecycle management software suite.<br>  The software was created in the late 1970s and early 1980s to develop Dassault's Mirage fighter jet, then was adopted in the aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding, and other industries.<br>  <br>  Automation, roboticization or industrial automation or numerical control is the use of control systems such as computers to control industrial machinery and processes, reducing the need for human intervention. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provided human operators with machinery to assist them with the physical requirements of work, automation greatly reduces the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Processes and systems can also be automated.<br>  Automation plays an increasingly important role in the global economy and in daily experience. Engineers strive to combine automated devices with mathematical and organizational tools to create complex systems for a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities.<br>  hsj

zgTsCicNaa	They won't actually fall off.<br>  <br>  In conditions when the body starts to lose more heat than it can easily generate to keep all parts at the normal 37°C it will start to allow the extremities, fingers, toes, ears, nose, and cheeks start to get cooler. There is still a blood flow to these body parts, but not as much flows as does normally. In order to keep the extremities at normal body temperature, greater blood flow would be required which would bring cooled blood back to the body core so cooling the body even further. The extremities have a high surface area/volume ratio, so they lose heat very easily.<br>  <br>  This reduction of blood flow is not normally a problem and happens to some extent for most people much of the time. In extreme or prolonged cold however it can lead to frost-nip and even frost-bite. These are situations in which the body has made the decision to risk or sacrifice some of the more expendable regions to preserve the core temperature and so avoid death from hypothermia.<br>  <br>  Frost Nip<br>  <br>  Most often observed at the end of the nose, tops of the ears or possibly fingers. The skin goes an unnatural looking "pasty white" color and loses sensation. This is caused by a lack of blood flow to those regions because they are losing so much heat. Frost nip is an early warning sign that if left will lead to frostbite. It can be readily corrected however by putting on extra clothing. The skidoo gloves I used in Antarctica had a large patch of sheepskin on the back to hold against and warm up any frost-nipped parts. The important thing with frost nip is to keep an eye on your companions as it is so easy to miss it on yourself.<br>  <br>  Frost nip can actually freeze the surface layers of the skin and lead to symptoms like sun burn with the warmed skin later turning bright red and being sloughed off. There is no permanent damage. <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Frost Bite<br>  <br>  Left unattended, frost-nip will lead to frost bite. The difference is that in frost bite, the skin actually falls below freezing point and ice crystals form within the live cells of the skin killing them in the process. On rewarming, the skin swells and blisters turning blue-purple to black - this then forms a hardened black carapace. If the damage is not severe, the dead layer is sloughed off revealing new healthy skin that has grown underneath. It is however very painful. This is known as superficial frost bite.<br>  <br>  "The temperature was -47°F and I was fool enough to take my hands out of my mitts to haul on the ropes to bring the sledges up. I started away with all ten fingers frostbitten. They did not really come back until we were in our tent for our night meal, and within a few hours there were two or three large blisters, up to an inch long on all of them. For many days those blisters hurt frightfully" <br>  - Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World<br>  <br>  More serious is when frostbite affects the deeper layers of muscle and bone. This almost always results in permanent tissue damage and may result in amputation of fingers, toes, even feet, hands and parts of the arm or leg. Many polar explorers and mountaineers have lost parts of some fingers or toes because of frostbite.<br>   <br>  <br>  Treating severe frostbite - serious damage can be caused when badly frostbitten body parts are rewarmed, particularly if it is done too rapidly. It is therefore better to keep the parts frozen until medical attention can be received.<br>  <br>  Who suffers the most?<br>   <br>  <br>  Cold weather on a modern society has a number of effects, most dramatically on the general population mortality rate. The average mortality on a winter's day is about 15% higher than on a summer's day. Cold weather is directly responsible for  deaths through such things as hypothermia, influenza, and pneumonia. It is also an indirect factor in a number of  ways such as death and injury from falls, accidents, carbon monoxide poisoning, and house fires all of which are partially attributable to cold.<br>  <br>  The sex and race of a person are important when it comes to how susceptible they are to direct cold injury and hypothermia. Non-white elderly men are the most at risk, while white women are the least at risk. <br>  <br>  Women have a higher gradient of temperature from the skin to the body core (they're more likely to have cold hands for instance) and so it seems are more able to maintain a constant body core temperature in cold conditions. Subcutaneous fat has a part to play of course as an insulator and women generally have more than do men so helping them stay warm. On the other hand, because of the high temperature gradient from skin to core, women are more likely to suffer from surface cold injury such as frostbite.<br>  <br>  Age has the highest influence, more so than gender, with elderly people of any race or sex having the least ability to survive cold injury. Studies have shown that shivering and vasoconstriction to reduce blood flow to the body periphery are not so prominent in older people, putting them at greater risk. Also a|`|Yd3YLIlraa	It's possible, but you'd have to be in super freezing cold wheather and Im sure you'd probably be dead by that point and wouldn't feel any of it.

The unions and the Labor Party were established to look after the rights of the working classes and the less fortunate. The poor were poorer than they would be now and there was no social security. On the other hand the politicians were so rich that they could look after themselves without being paid out of the public purse like they are now. It was rule by the wealthy and whose interests do you thihk they really had in mind. Having said that, Australia is far more egalitarian than other places.

Yet the last half century has been about trying to blame it on one guy (or 10 guys, or 100 guys, but scapegoats none the less) and forgive the rest. Being given forgiveness so easily doesn't necessarily cause remorse. So, there's still a Naziism problem. (Moreso in Austria, but still in Germany) Racism is passed from father to son, and mother to daughter, and doesn't disappear without major and constant effort. Be ever vigilent against it. <br>  I'm not German, so it would be out of line for me to tell you guys what to do about it. We've got our own problems to deal with here in the US.

It is illegal in Germany to show any kind of Nazi symbols, it is illegal and punishable by law to do the Hitler salute, it is illegal to deny the holocaust, and millions are paid in reparations. The German government supports Nazism? Really?<br>  <br>  If there is a Professor at a school making racist remarks about Jewish or Muslim women, than that school has to deal with it. Talk to the professor first and tell him that you do not appreciate his remarks and what you think of them, and tell him to think about what he says out loud and to watch it. If he continues or starts to diss you (even indirectly), go to the dean and to the "Fachschaft".<br>  <br>  The problem is that in Germany, Professors are "verbeamted", that means they are working for the state and can not just be fired, like they would be in every other country. The state (! Not the school! The state!) has to either release them (which is a process that takes very long and is usually done after court ruling, and can be faught against by the professor - long, drwan out process) or the teacher has to resign, which he likely would never do, depending on what he is teaching and whether he could get a better (paid) job out in the normal job market, especially with such a tag on his name.<br>  <br>  Than again: what did he say? I have heard of some professors being mean, tacky, sarcastic or even venemous to students. Any student whose nose they didn't like, be they German or otherwise. Simply stating that he is a nazi because you are of Jewish descent (which he likely doesn't even know if you have never talked about it) or crying racism because you are a muslim wearing a head scarf is just as ignorant as really being a Nazi or a Racist. Just as crying "Racist" is if someone tells you to learn the language before trying to go through with your studies. I've had a couple of "colleagues" trying to get pulled through the program crying "racists" as soon as they got a bad grade because their language skills were bad. Besides: we all got bad grades. We just passed, they failed because they fainted to not understand the question and only answered in very broken German, even though in normal talk, they understood and talked quite well. I got angry about that, and I was just a colleague. I am all for fair treatment of everybody, wherever they come from, but they all have to measure up to the same standards in class, and german teachers should not have to bow to anyones feet and let them pass simply because they are Jewish or Muslim, even if they didn't get the answers right. So:<br>  <br>  What exactly happened? What makes you say he is a Nazi?
AA10176626	Let's start out with the obvious - by official state legislative statute (Alabama Code 16-64), non-state residents are required to pay tuition fees that are "at least twice that of resident student tuition".<br>  <br>  If you are thinking that you can start at Alabama as a non-resident, and later qualify as a state resident - that's really unlikely. Not impossible, but highly unlikely. For one thing, as is the case in almost every state, an individual can never qualify for state residency in Alabama if their primary purpose in moving to the state is to obtain an education.<br>  <br>  Here's the exact statement of the rule: <br>  <br>  "Persons in Alabama primarily for the purpose of obtaining an education are presumed to be non-resident students"<br>  <br>  So how much will you pay to attend school in Alabama as a non-resident? About $29,000 a year, when you include tuition, fees, books, room and board, and your other miscellaneous college expenses.<br>  <br>  What would it cost you to attend NCSU as an NC resident? About $11,000 a year.<br>  <br>  Do the math.

It's a comprehensive free public service with more than 2,000 MBA programs listed worldwide. It allows you to search for programs by location (US, Europe, Far East, etc.), by concentration (finance, marketing, aviation management, health management, accounting, etc.), by type of program (full-time, distance learning, part-time, etc), and by listing your own criteria and preferences to get a list of universities that satisfy your needs. You can use the Guide to contact schools of your choice, examine their data, visit their web site, and send them pre applications. You can see lists of top 40 schools ranked by starting salaries of graduates, GMAT scores, and other criteria.

Wherever we look, we find criminals and crime. Criminals have become a part of our daily lives. Does this mean we let them be the darkness of our society? No, definitely not. Eliminating crime and criminals is our duty, and we cannot ignore it. Getting the rightly accused to a just punishment is very important. Some criminals commit a crime because they have no other option to survive, but some do it for fun. I do not advocate death penalty for everybody. A person, who stole bread from a grocery store, definitely does not deserve death penalty. However, a serial killer, who kills people for fun or for his personal gain, definitely deserves death penalty. Death penalty should continue in order to eliminate the garbage of our society. Not everybody deserves to die, but some people definitely do. I support death penalty because of several reasons. Firstly, I believe that death penalty serves as a deterrent and helps in reducing crime. Secondly, it is true that death penalty is irreversible, but it is hard to kill a wrongly convicted person due to the several chances given to the convicted to prove his innocence. Thirdly, death penalty assures safety of the society by eliminating these criminals. Finally, I believe in "lex tallionis" - a life for a life. <br>  <br>  Deterrence means to punish somebody as an example and to create fear in other people for the punishment. Death penalty is one of those extreme punishments that would create fear in the mind of any sane person. Ernest van den Haag, in his article "On Deterrence and the Death Penalty" mentions, "One abstains from dangerous acts because of vague, inchoate, habitual and, above all, preconscious fears" (193). Everybody fears death, even animals. Most criminals would think twice if they knew their own lives were at stake. Although there is no statistical evidence that death penalty deters crime, but we have to agree that most of us fear death. Suppose there is no death penalty in a state and life imprisonment without parole is the maximum punishment. What is stopping a prisoner who is facing a life imprisonment without parole to commit another murder in the prison? According to Paul Van Slambrouck, " Assaults in prisons all over US, both against fellow inmates and against staff, have more than doubled in the past decade, according to statistics gathered by the Criminal Justice Institute in Middletown, Connecticut" (Christian Science Monitor, Internet). There is no stopping these inmates from committing further crimes within the prison, if they are already facing the maximum punishment. Anti-death penalty advocates argue that imprisonment itself could deter criminals. They believe that we do not need to go to the extreme measure of killing the criminals to deter crime. Hugo Adam Bedau in his article, "Capital Punishment and Social Defense" mentions, "Crimes can be deterred only by making would-be criminals frightened of being arrested, convicted, and punished for crimes& " (301). Unfortunately, the ever-increasing population in the prisons proves otherwise. Somehow, just imprisonment is not enough for some people to stop them from committing a crime. The number of criminals is increasing every year. In 1990, there were 42,733 prisoners in Alaska, whereas in 1999 it increased to 68,599 (Death Penalty USA Pages, Internet). Some criminals may think that they would never be caught, and just keep committing crimes. The perfect example for this would be serial killers. For such people, death penalty should be there, so that others, who even think about committing such crimes, learn a lesson that every criminal is eventually caught. <br>  <br>  Anti-death penalty advocates believe that death penalty is irreversible and may become a cause of irreversible mistakes. Once a person has been sentenced to death and thus death penalty practiced, there is nothing that can be done to undo the punishment if the accused turns out to be innocent. I agree that death penalty is irreversible, but the chance of making a mistake in death penalty is extremely low. Death penalty is considered an extreme punishment and the judicial system takes a lot of care in finalizing the decision. There are several safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. For example, "Capital punishment may be imposed only when guilt is determined by clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts", "Anyone sentenced to death shall receive the right to appeal to a court of higher jurisdiction", etc. (Capital Punishment: Life or Death, Internet). There are several other privileges provided to the convicted that assure that death penalty is given to the rightly accused person. According to Haag, "Trials are more likely to be fair when life is at stake - the death penalty is probably less often unjustly inflicted than others" (192). Statistics reveal that there is far less number of dea|`|djX0o7V4aa	He won't be smirking once he gets to prison, who wants to waste all their young life in jail?  they might be given a play station etc, but would anyone want to waste away their lives playing one of them all day?|`|mBgi9fdwaa	less cost for the government.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I sometimes question why some people where put on this earth because I can't figure it out and think the world would be better without them.

AA10128218	If your Boyfriend is a professional welder? then you should be looking for a name brand (Miller, Lincoln, Hobart) machine.  It should be at least a 220 volt welder (household current)  It should also have the ability to weld with different wire sizes .023 .030 .035 up to .045  with the right rollers installed and use shielding gas (Co2/argon mix) That way he will be able to weld sheet metal all the way up to 1/2" plate.  With the right options in time he could add on a spool gun to weld aluminum as well.<br>  <br>  If you have time?  research your gift.....and get the best deal possible.  If you have a local welding supply company?  Give them a call and see if they might have a used or returned machine.  Most reliable companies will still honor a warranty if applicable and also be there if there are any questions.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.....sounds like he is a very lucky guy.<br>  <br>  GeorgiaHyway|`|AA11353918	A Lincoln is very good and has a wide variety.

fef477f17ee822369508186f91d9a3a7aa	Intracultural communication? That would communication between people of one culture. Intercultural Communication, which is probably what your talking about, is the study of how people communicate between cultures. This studies how proxcemics (peoples personal space) are different between cultures and how when someone from a cultural that has much closer proxcemics talks to say someone from the western cultural the westerner will keep backing up to move further away while the other person will try and get closer. Things like this are studied in Intercultural Comm.|`|d7e9a9be41a1e3c5ec3363d459686ff6aa	By definition, the use and study of communication dates to the earliest information found in anthropological sites and includes each now-ongoing debate about competing meanings of some stimulus--carried out by an ever-changing mix of participants in a dozen countries across the world. Communication is the process of sharing information in mass communication, culture, intimate physical contact and among layers of silicon in the latest integrated circuit. Communication is the form and the substance that is the interesting stuff of genes, and it is the specific transmission of information through the round dance one honey bee initiates to inform her hive mates. Communication is also the (mis)understood subtext of the debate about beauty across time, perhaps expressed with many images and few if any words.<br>  <br>  Communication processes include sign-mediated interactions and even the unintended consequences of public acts. Babies communicate as do professional dance troupes, and complex organizations. Some say that a rock tumbling down a hill communicates by transferring entropy or atrophy. Others say that only humans truly communicate (engage in abstract symbolic discourse). Some would say buildings communicate, others perhaps, the building's designers, owners, tenants, constructors, advertisers, visitors or even its destroyers do the communication. "Communication professionals" can be found in many fields including cybernetics, information theory, public speaking, color (in any medium), music, advertising, poetry, forward reconnaissance operatives, political consultants, high school band teachers, jazz musicians and psychologists. Two boys fighting over the affections of a girl are flooding communicative messages and it would be common for students of communication to study the societal and cultural contexts that monitors/encourages/frames adolescent fighting, the patriarchial/matriarchial histories and the familial relationships of everyone involved, the outsider role of the school security guard, the public relations assistant to the principal nervously observing through a plate glass window and life coach of the community organizer who wants to see the principal fired. The newspaper journalist happening by participates in a communicative act by sizing up the situation and deciding whether the communicative environment at the newspaper would welcome a first hand account or would dismiss it as trivial. The telephone conversation notifying the family members of the fight participants, the designers of the transportation system used to come pick up their children and the narratives that initially framed the fight and that will be prescribing/proscribing behaviors of classmates tomorrow and children decades into the future can also be stated and debated as communicative acts. Some philosophers, including some monists say that all there is, is communication.<br>  <br>  This is the strength and the weakness of communication. That which includes everything means nothing. This is also why nearly every use of "communication" is attached to one or more modifiers: interpersonal, political, nonverbal, systematic, pedagogical, musical, operational, dynamical and even quantum communication. No single article could hope to cover the breadth and depth of all that is communication--indeed, the entire Wikipedia, the political movement behind Wikipedia, the written and unwritten guidelines that govern the contributors, distributors and consumers of this Wikipedia are all participants in communicative processes. By reading this article, when you are reading it, the manner in which you read it, why you are reading it, what you think of it, and even if you are reading it (or listening to it, or recalling it) you are engaged in communication.<br>  <br>  Lest we say nothing about communication by trying to say everything about it, we (the past, current and future representatives of various Wikipedia topics and sensibilities) who stumble upon this broad topic and add to, sharpen or clarify each's own experiences and understandings of communication will continue to make this an expanding article. We (the past, current and future readers of this article) will best benefit from well organized additions and clarifications of some small part of communication, rather than from competing definitions which exclude each other.<br>  <br>  Possibly more than any other Wikipedia topic, "communication" will do best at helping those who are pursuing some particular application or attribute of communication. It will be of little help to those who want to find the definitive answer to a question such as "what is and is not communication." For information about specific fields within the broad category you might want to jump right to the linked article, remembering that many people--even "communication professionals" use communication in dramatically differing ways.<br>  <br>  Intercultural competence is the ability of successful communication with people of other cultures. This ability can exist in someone at a young age, or may be developed and improved due to willpower and competence. The bases for a successful intercultural communication are emotional competence, together with intercultural sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Interculturally competent is a person who captures and understands, in interaction with people from foreign cultures, their specific concepts in perception, thinking, feeling and acting. Earlier experiences are considered, free from prejudices; there is an interest and motivation to continue learning.

Moving away for a while makes you grow up and get your confidence faster, and the good colleges really can make a difference.

If they both do, you can always give one a try for a while, and if you decide you don't like it try the other one. As far as the whole debt thing goes, as long as you don't get a credit card an buy things you really can't afford then you shouldn't have a problem.

(I've found the more the better -you'll get more edu out of it and that's the point!)<br>  - Can you get grants/scholarships/work placements?<br>  - Can you function and feel comfortable outside of your family's comfort zone?<br>  - Could you go to one and transfer to the other? <br>  <br>  Also -don't think of the cost right now. The important thing, as said above, is that you fufill your education. You need to chose the best uni for that and only that reason. I know it sounds selfish but it's really not -do what's best for yourself and your future -not for your friends & family.

JJonolNPaa	Io sono laureata in lingue (non triennale,ma vecchio ordinamento c'è una grande differenza) e ti posso dire che per sceglierla come facoltà devi essere STRA portato per le lingue straniere.Potrebbe sembrare una banalità ma non lo è. Gli esami annuali di conoscenza delle lingue sono tostissimi e se non li passi ti precludono il passaggio all'anno successivo (nonchè la laurea). Tra i miei compagni erano la maggioranza quelli che non passavano gli esami di lingua e rimanevano 'bloccati' anche per diversi anni.<br>  Psicologia a quanto sento è la più facile insieme a scienze politiche, non serve avere particolari attitudini, è molto discorsiva. Il problema è che a menochè tu non abbia già uno studio a cui appoggiarti fai conto che trovare lavoro sarà molto difficile.<br>  Di iscritti a giurisprudenza c'è stato un boom negli ultimi anni (come ad economia) e li il discorso è lo stesso per quanto riguarda il lavoro: se non sai dove appoggiarti è inutile che lo fai. Inoltre devi essere appassionata di diritto e devi preventivare dopo i 5 anni canonici di passarne sui libri altrettanti se non di più per varie specializzazioni abilitazioni concorsi ecc ecc è un po come medicina,se sei bravissima e fortunata cominci a lavorare a 35 anni, non prima.<br>  Ingegneria è abbastanza una garanzia, dal punto di vista lavorativo. Come difficoltà l'indirizzo gestionale è il più facile,ma anche il più abusato.<br>  Infine, qualsiasi facoltà sceglierai ti sconsiglio di fermarti al diploma universitario dei 3 anni ma di farli tutti e 5.<br>  Con i primi laureati del n.ordinamento si è visto che il triennio da solo non serve a nulla.<br>  Spero di averti aiutato<br>  baci|`|1mYiklPJaa	Lingue, psicologia e giurisprudenza richiedono di studiare molte cose teoriche, cioè non esercizi...ad ingegneria si fanno tanti esercizi...poi ricorda che esistono vari corsi di ingegneria (areospaziale, edile...)... un pò meno, di corsi, (mi sembra) per le altre facoltà che hai menzionato. Secondo me nella scelta c'è da valutare:1. gli sbocchi occupazionali (ingegneria è la prima) 2 lo sforzo che si vuole fare nell'intraprendere la facoltà 3 il grado di piacevolezza della facoltà scelta 4 quanto o meno sei portata per la materia (ma se una cosa ti piace anche se non ne sei tanto portata, non credo ci siano problemi...)<br>  Ciao|`|6a8cd226cd6d072c55c69cc7d30b8b7eaa	io non sopporto ki classifica le università in facolta di serie A e di serie B..io penso ke siano tutte parekkio difficili e dipende dalle proprie attitudini.ad esempio io nn avrei mai scelto una facoltà come ingegneria o giurisprudenza proprio xke nn mi sento portata x gli argomenti e le materie ke si fanno.invece mi sento molto portata per la psicologia ke è la facoltà ke ho scelto..ma magari un'altra persona puo trovare difficile la facoltà di psicologia..è tutto molto soggettivo|`|8549b54d3978018d728d833d1c58c714aa	Le facoltà sono tutte difficili e tutte facili: l'importante è essere convinti di ciò che si vuole fare...<br>  Io mi sono laureata in pedagogia.

UcT0NSzuaa	Un giorno un giovane di nome Artù riesce ad estrarre una spada magica dalla roccia e diventa re di Camelot e di tutta la Bretagna. Due compiti attendono il grande Re : il primo, fondare l'ordine dei Cavalieri della Tavola rotonda; il secondo, la ricerca del santo Graal. Tra incantesimi e magie, tra tornei e duelli, tra amori e tradimenti i cavalieri riescono a trovare il santo Graal , ma l'usurpatore Mordret coinvolge Artù in un duello cruento . Artù ferito a morte giace sulla spiaggia e chiede al suo scudiero di gettare in mare la sua spada, Escalibur. Appena la spada tocca l'acqua una mano misteriosa esce dalle onde, l'afferra e scampare tra i flutti. Artù muore.<br>  (ricorda k la storia si svolge nells bella Bretagna)<br>  spero d esserti stata d aiuto...+ riassunto d cosi si muore...|`|3yl6D10Maa	<a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070605093644AAPhDX5&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHwLLtmEus_QT._fWQnI3JnMWm6_TVYwIAp6w--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|LG7UdONAaa	Cavaglieri?
