20090309175506AAmyvYJ	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Will I see faster results with a Wireless-N Gigabit router? (fast 10 points for a good answer)?	Right now I have a Wireless-G 10/100 router.  Our internet keeps disconnecting and we have decided to buy a new router.  I am thinking of buying a Wireless-N 10/100/1000 router. Right now I only have 1 PC that has a Wireless-N network adapter and the other 2 PCs have Wireless-G adapters.  I have multiple parts to this question.  1.  Would the speed difference be noticeable or how much faster would it be for the PC with the N adapter if I had a Wireless-N router?   2.  Would all the other wireless devices that are only Wireless-G see a speed increase or even decrease with a Wireless N router?   3. What does the 10/100 and 10/100/1000 mean?   Thanks so much for your help!

So i was online and one of those fake virus-remover things popped up and installed itself, so I tried to run MalwareBytes to remove it (which has worked before). My computer turned off and when trying to restart it it went to a blue screen of death. (: I said something about uninstalling anti-virus programs, but since i can't get onto my computer i can't uninstall them.    I tried running it in Safe Mode, no difference. The same blue screen.    My computer has been having LOTS of problems recently, so should I just get a new one? =/ (trying everything BUT that)    What can I do, and what could be wrong? (:   Thanks.

I know you can draw in realtime, accurate dimensions and AutoCAD will automatically scale the drawing thereafter but I just can't remember how. I used ACAD 2000 back in the day and years later it seems that 2009 has changed quite a bit.      Thanks to everyone in advance.

My video is 8min long so i's not over the time limit...I doubt it's even saying that ecause of a violation.

20090309195133AA8nlhM	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How do I structure a table in access?	I need to create two tables (or maybe more?).  My goal is to keep track of physicians and their specialties.  I have some physicians with just one specialty, others with multiple specialties.  How would the tables look in access?  For example right now I have in my two tables...      *Physician_ID, LastName, FirstName, Specialty   *SpecialtyName      The * indicates that it is the primary key.      I know this will not work for physicians that have more than one specialty.  Can someone give me some insight as to how I need to structure my tables to allow physicians to have more than one specialty, so that when I run a query on a Doctor all of their specialties will show?  Thanks

Ok, I have some control buttons within a Microsoft Word document (a form that I created). Ok so I have a text box field where I will be entering a patients name in (named TextBox1).  Now I want to program this so that I don't have to type the patients name in on every page in other words what ever I type into the text box, I want it to appear in every page.      So I understand that the name on the first page would have to be a text box field since it would need to be typed in.  Now for page two, where it says patient name, I understand to make this field a Label.  So I want whatever is typed in the text box to appear in the label.        Can anyone help?

20090507072814AAijK1n	Computers & Internet;Software	Why do you really prefer one browser over another?	Seriously, all you do with browsers is look at the Internet. That's it. Aren't the differences between browsers overrated? Seriously, if all you could see was the Internet part, and not the tabs or anything above them, would you really be able to tell the difference? Why all the hype about this browser being better than that one?      Now some of you will certainly be chomping at the bit to tell me about security; however, consider first that I recommend to everyone Site Advisor. This free product will pop-up a red balloon if you go to any web sites that have malware. It will also put green, yellow, and red icons next to your Google and Yahoo search results.  http://www.siteadvisor.com/       In other words, it's possible to avoid dangerous sites altogether, making browser security--not irrelevant--but less important.      So again, I ask: why are people such avid (rabid) fans of certain browsers?

It's not wireless, and the power meter seems to be fine. Can anyone tell me what might be wrong?

20070316021141AASRade	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	I am trying to make a form with dynamic opacity in VC#?	So here's my problem.  I have Form1 (my main form) and About (separate form).  When I click a certain button on Form1, I want it to open About and set the opacity of Form1 to 50% (0.5).  Now, when I click the OK button on About, I want Form1's opacity back at 100% (1).      I have it able to open and close About at will, and set the opacity at 50% (in the buttonClick statement), but it's getting back to 100% that I'm having trouble with.  I cannot figure it out for the life of me.  Perhaps a loop statement in Form1's main statement?  I was trying to get it to set the opacity from About, but that is proving to be somewhat difficult, since there's already an instance of Form1 open (and I need it to stay open).      I will be later changing this to make it +0.1 in opacity every millisecond, but I just need a general idea of where to go with this now.  Thanks in advance.
20070520212601AAQWzWl	Computers & Internet;Software	I want to convert MPEG4 encoded AVI back to DVD--but it's more complex than that...?	OK, so I have 14 DVDs with 13 episodes per disc (2 discs per season).  Each episode has approximately the following specs:      - Appx. 45min length   - 1060kbps bit rate   - mpeg4 format   - 576px. x 432px.   - 23.98fps      Audio   - ac3 audio   - 192kbps audio bit rate   - 48000Hz   - Stereo audio      Each episode is roughly 356mb.  Is there any way to convert each episode to DVD format (regular 4.7 DVD) while still preserving the low file-sizes?  I have tried converting directly to VOB but it expands each episode to about 1gb, which is way too big!   I have also tried using Sony's DVD Architect to decrease the bit rate to allow such a thing, but in that program you have to decrease it to below 700kbps, which is apparently too low because it messed up the video pretty good.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Thank you.      PS: I would like to not have to use 5+ DVDs for each season, so it is a necessity to retain the low file-sizes.

20070527103601AAD7YDJ	Computers & Internet;Software	Why is the Mozilla Firefox window jumpy?	I just bought a new PC and new monitor and one of the first things I did was download Mozilla Firefox. However, most of the time I open it, the webpages seem to be jumping/shaking up and down, as if I'm constantly scrolling up and down. The problem is, I'm not scrolling, the web pages are just erratic. The other problem is this is not a consistent problem, It happens almost every time I launch Firefox, but not every time. It is, however, unique to Firefox. I can use IE without any problems and I haven't experienced any other programs with similar errors.   Is there a fix within Firefox? Is there a problem with my monitor? With how my monitor is hooked up? Is there a problem with my graphics card?   I'm probably panicking over nothing, but I appreciate any feedback. I spent plenty of money on getting a new computer,and I'd like to be able to use it worry free. Thank you!

One is a normal program crash window, but the other is an error message saying "The instruction at '0x771cf424" referenced memory at '0xe05d89e4'. The memory could not be 'written'. Click OK to terminate the program" I used to be able to just move these windows to the side and play music normally , but now the error message closes iTunes altogether. I have tried reinstalling the software multiple times but the problem persists. How do I solve this?

20070618114044AAKXelY	Computers & Internet;Security	Norton Antivirus 2007?	have been told that once Norton places a questionable file in quarantine (ie suspected trojan) that if you delet the item from quarantine it will be deleted from your program files, thus removing the risk. However when you go to the Norton site, they have removal tools. Why would one need to use the removal tools if it is automatically deleted?

20070621154538AAiSdUc	Computers & Internet;Security	HELP!! My computer is infected with spyware virus?	My computer has been infected with spyware virus for a week by now. I left it like that for like 4 days then I went out to buy an antispyware program. I bought McAfee VirusScan Plus 2007.   I bought it and installed it. The program scanned and removed some of the spyware but it is nowhere close to getting rid of every spyware. And m computer constantly turns off itself with blue screen popping up telling me that computer is turning off because of system failure or whatever.   I tried to turn on the computer on Safe Mode, it worked the first few times. However, now my computer would not even turn on. The blue error screen pops up everytime.   It is horrible. I do not want to reinstall the Windows XP again.   I can't lose all my files. I spent 40 dollars on that stupid antispyware program too.       Please help me.

20081002120414AAYjB8Y	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Hard drive failure but not hard drive failure?	Okay so I've asked a few questions in the past day and got some great answers... but my hard drive is failing but not?       I rank chkdsk and chkdsk /r from the recovery console of the windows XP CD It said the hard drive had bad sectors so I repaired ran it again it said it had errors on the disk / drive. So I used hirens boot CD to run two independant drive tests and they both came back without errors.      I "repaired" the windows XP files... but now it doesn't even get to the starting up screen, it gets to the loading screen Windows XP (with the green or blue bar scrolling across) the lights flash on my computer and it stops loading... (the capslock, numlock lights).      What could be causing this? Still hard drive failure, perhaps hardware issue or maybe even a virus? Sometimes it even freezes in the boot CD menus with no apparent cause (to me).      I have a Toshiba P100 Satelite laptop, 1GB RAM, 100GB Toshiba 2.5 inch hard drive, wireless card cd-rom/dvd rom/burner/ duo core 2400 @ 1.8 Ghz

When it is times sensitive material I find that I sometimes get the 2nd mailing before the original email.  Our Outlook settings are correct, so that is not an issue.

20070721160452AAmKkEy	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why are PC users dumb?	I'm not trying to sound mean here, but most of the time, PC users just don't know what they're doing. I'm an IT worker and I know what I'm saying.      They're always complaining and everything. They blame Microsoft, they blame me, they blame everyone.      Then they look at the Mac and they think it's the right choice : WRONG!      You know what the problem is with new users and PC's? They make the wrong choice.       They buy a cheap PC (run on bad configurations), get no anti-virus (or download it for free on the internet - which is dangerous), and when things go wrong, guess who they blame?      Me. Microsoft. Almost anybody.      PC users have to understand that they themselves are responsible.      They should buy a high-end/mid-range PC, Windows Vista, Live OneCare, and get high-speed internet.      Do that, and then you have less prolems. It's that obvious.      But nope, it seems Macs are the end all answer for dummies. But Macs get more users confused and mad at me!      So what do you think?

When i start up, instead of showing me the pictures of the users to click on with a blue backround, it gives me a black backround and a field to type the username and password, whith instead of my custom name, i have to use Compaq_Owner (yes. its a compaq presario) then its noral for startup      when i press crt+alt+del., instead of bringing up the task manager, it hides all running programs, icons, everything except the desktop backround and brings up a window that has the xp home logo, last login, and the name of my compuer, and has six buttons at the bottom to "lock Computer" "Log Off" "Shut Down" "change Password" "taskmanager" or "cancel".      When i go to the start menu and click the shut-off key, instead of a window with 3 buttons, it brings up a window with the windows xp logo, and a drop down list of 6 otions such as log off, shut down, hibernate, resart, or standby. the log-off key on the start menu (not the drop down menu on the weird) it just has log-off, and is a grey window, not the xp log-off window with the button to "Log-Off" or "Switch-users"      i i remember right, this is like windows 98 (except the windows xp logo replaced for 98 logo of course) and i dont like it. (i especily hate the ctr+alt+del. thing) it started after i installed sp3, so i uninstalled (didnt work) so i reinstalled (didnt work) i also had the vista insirat installed before sp3, and it messed up a little so i restored back to before the sp3, uninstalled vista inspirat and reinstalled sp3 (which is when this happened)       for more information on vista inspirat (not sure if it'll help but) here is the site:  http://www.crystalxp.net/galerie/en.id.1...

First off, I'm not exactly sure what MMS means, but anyways...There is a website that I used to download 5-10 minute movie clips using the files' HTTP address. Recently the website switched to what seems to be an MMS streaming format.  Under each of the formats (HTTP and MMS) the videos are embedded in the webpage. While there were still under the HTTP format I would just view the HTML source and then copy and paste the video files' web address into my Download Manager program. Now that they are in the MMS transfer format they files appear to only be a few KB and I'm confused as to how to get the entire WMV video file as I did when they were still under the HTTP transfer format.

I builded a custom pc with vista 64 ultimate 2 months ago, and recently I bought some new games, and I am having trouble playing some games, which is Crysis and The Witcher. For some reason the game will just crash after couple of minutes of gameplay. I know its not hardware problems, because I played other games and it runs perfectly.      Games such as: Hellgate: London, FEAR and other expansions, HL2 and episode 1 and 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, CS:S, DOD:S, BF2142, and some other games.      I tried latest patches and hotfixes, drivers and beta drivers, temperature monitering, and no overclocking.

Ok I bought a lot of clothing on eBay and paid via money order because I do not have a bank account or credit cards to a get pay pal account.  The lot was almost $100.  So eBay sent me the address to send the payment to the seller and I sent it right away.  The seller then sent me a email like 2 weeks later saying that eBay has the wrong address on file despite trying several times to change it.  And that they would wait to see if the payment was forwarded to the new address or if it got sent back to me.  So I waited and still nothing.  I emailed asking if the payment had been received yet and was told that the sellers MIL owns the "old house" and she told her renters to let her know if they got anything for them.  Still nothing and I sent payment on 10/27/08.  Is there anything that I can do to either get my purchase or get my money back or anything?  I have the stub from the money order still.  Please help.

20081109140711AAVQPoF	Computers & Internet;Software	How do you fix a program that's non-responsive?	Too often I'll be use a program and something will happen that will cause that program to freeze and become unresponsive, and will basically say so in the window toolbar and in the task manager.  My question is though, is there any way to coax the computer to clear up whatever caused the lock-up and continue without shutting the program down?  Too many times when this happens, it's right in the middle of something and I loose work; or like today, I'm trying to do a data recovery scan and part way through the scan, the data recovery program inexplicably locks up and I have to close the program down and start the scan over again, wasting a lot of time!  I'm getting really tired of the freeze-ups; especially when it happens after I do something inane, like click on a file brought up in the scan, or click save in another program.  How I can I handle this without forcing these programs to close?
