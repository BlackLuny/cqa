It's free.<br>  <br>  The first time you open it, it will say something about adding all your music to the library. Click yes or OK. It might also need to convert songs to mp4/m4a format (apple format). Just go along with it.<br>  <br>  If you already have iTunes, go to File>Add file to library. A little window will pop up. Hold the ctrl button and click on all of the songs you want to add to itunes, or click on the first song, hold the shift button and click on the last song in the list.<br>  <br>  Then, sync your iPod.|`|e5f248f4ec77213104ecd5af443312b5aa	Just drag the files to iTunes, or set up iTunes to look for music files on your PC.|`|IF7WSw2zaa	This is an Alternate way to do this other than limewire.

2BgZMwOWaa	ps3 games are on blue ray discs. as far as hd goes if your talking about having an hdtv it is highly recomended but not required. I play on a hdtv and love it i've played once on non hd and it was a huge change couldnt handle it lol. But if you get the ps3 and an hdtv make sure you get hdmi cable as well cause thats what makes it so much clearer|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Nope. Sorry dude. You'll need a blu-ray player or a ps3 could work too. But neither of them could go together unless you have an HD tv cause they're the only ones capable of the advanced picture. Take  it from a guy who's actually tried it.|`|UphoLYGYaa	Blu-ray beat out HD-DVD to be the format for home HD movies.  Every PS3 game is made on Blu-ray, so every game is in HD. However if you don't have a HDTV you can still enjoy a PS3 on a standard tube tv. The picture will be slightly better compared to a PS2, but will still look great. It comes with everything you need to hook up to a standard tv in the box.<br>  <br>  In order to maximize the PS3's visual and audio you will need to connect it to a HDTV with a HDMI cable. The HDTV should be 720p at least, 1080p if you want to use the PS3 to watch blu-ray movies. 95% of PS3 games are 720p so 720p is acceptable. Very few games are in 1080p and television shows aren't being broadcast in 1080p yet, while the majority of home Blu-ray movies are in 1080p.  A 1080p television will be good in the future when 1080p eventually becomes the standard.|`|dfRu4G1gaa	dude blue ray is just the way the information is read from your cd, it has nothing to do with your screen.<br>  if you want the best graphics and stuff you need to buy a HD tv...|`|912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	You can play on a standard TV, it just won't look as nice.<br>  <br>  And blue ray is not better than HD it IS HD|`|doOqgl1Uaa	u need a hd tv it dosent matter if it is 720p or 1080p becuz u can change the resolution on the ps3 on the tv if u go to setting and u do the whole thing|`|tyRNuhJkaa	No you can use a standard definition TV, via S-video, scart, AV etc.<br>  <br>  Ps3 normaly comes with AV/scart leads instead of HDMI<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|nigSXGtyaa	You do not need hd but you will not get the full effect of the blu ray player.|`|AuQBlXdhaa	yes, blu-ray is hd, but it enhances the hd

s2TYiaC7aa	As far as I know, you have to drag & drop music onto the phone's SD card to get music on it - and it won't recognize files with DRM, so nothing you got from iTunes will play on the G1. When you first connect the phone, you'll notice the USB logo in the notification bar. Drag the notification bar down, tap on that logo, and it will ask if you want to mount the SD chip. Say yes, and then you can treat it just like you would any USB mass storage device - but it's not recognized as an MP3 player by any media player, so it won't sync automatically.

6qsTmMQaaa	I honestly don't see any pros to cancelling the production of VHS tapes, other than the fact that movie sales would probably go through the roof, as so many people own DVD players, and have gotten rid of VHS players. <br>  <br>  There are so many cons I can think of, because I love VHS tapes with a passion. VHS tapes are, in my opinion, the greatest way to watch movies, other than on the Internet, which is half the time illegal. With VHS tapes, you can always remove the tape from the player, and replace the tape with another and never lose your place on the first tape. That doesn't happen with DVDs. <br>  <br>  Also, VHS tapes rarely have problems with the viewing value. What I mean by this is that DVDs scratch up when overused, and it's somewhat a waste of money if you think about it, because they're SO easy to scratch it's ridiculous. Unless you step on a VHS tape, there really isn't anything that impairs the viewing value. <br>  <br>  Along with that, VHS tapes make me feel so much more young, as I watch old Disney movies and children's films from my childhood. They're so much more fun that way. Yes, it's fun to see them in high-definition, but I'd much rather view some of my favorite childhood movies the way I viewed them as a child, ya know?
WY5f0d0qaa	The LG Voyager Titanium.<br>  I have it right now and in my opinion, it's the best phone out right now. It has a nice spread out keyboard like the env2, but way better. And unlike the env models, the front screen is a touch screen and you can do as much stuff on the touch screen as you can on the inside. The battery life is great and can last a few days without it charging. Also, the 2.0 megapixels camera takes good pictures and records good videos. It has a lot of features, and it's $80.00 with the contract. The touch screen vibrates to your touch and the full qwerty keyboard rocks! It also holds about 220 texts until its full. AND ABOUT THE INTERNET: The touch screen and inside is great with the internet, I'm telling you , its like a real computer. And its a real browser. This IS the best phone out and you need to get it with a verizon plan.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tZNlebbLaa	I recommend you search for best coverage first, and then zero in on a phone for that service.

VJ1C5JsYaa	gmeezyjr is so wrong. Its correct that bungie said that halo 3 is meant to be run off the disc. However its only halo 3 that they are referring to. It was actually MS that also. What it does is installs the disc to your HD. This serves three main purposes. Number one is the system runs cooler. Since it does not have to waste the energy spinning the disc the system will not get as hot helping you to avoid the RRoD. Second is that the system will not be as loud since its not spinning the disc. The Third is that load times in ever game is decreased except in halo 3.|`|hrLXNG6uaa	dont listen to these guys. it slows it down and your xbox 360 is actually louder! i downloaded halo 3 and it screwed up my xbox live. like bungie said "its made to run onto the disc". oh and it does go onto your hard drive.|`|vrfKf5o2aa	it puts the game on ur hard drive. but u still need the disk inside to play. load times are considerably decreased. as with the noise. and games seem to run more smoothly :)|`|UAMwT76Maa	it doesn't put the game on there  it actually a feature to make your 360 do less work so it will sound a hell of alot quieter

V4ZSGQBoaa	Alright.  If you already have a wireless router, you dont need to buy anything because unlike xbox the wii does not need a wireless attachment.  The wii has an internal thing that automatically picks up a wireless signal anywhere you go.  If your in the city near a store that has free wifi you dont even need a wireless router.  If you dont have a wireless network set up then you do need to buy the LAN adapter and a very very long Ethernet cord.  This would be a lot more work though.  I bought one, and then got a wireless router and things have been much easier, and I am with a useless LAN adapter now.  I hope this helps you.|`|y8HKAhBFaa	wow dont buy it i bought one and it was a rip of $30! i used it like once and it is the same as a wireless tho... get a USB Wi-Fi Connector. Get it off amazon.

CQA4HAdmaa	If your locker has a lock on it and she knows the combo, the iPod should be there-Your friend is either irresponsible or lying.  At the same time, if she is your friend and close enough to share your combo, there is no way she will be able to use it or show it in front of her friends without it being noticed. If there was no lock on your locker, then your friend was being irresponsible.  When you hand you belonging to someone, they need to take reasonable care of it.  Because everyone knows it's something that is high in demand to steal, she needs to take better care.<br>  <br>  One thing i would do it make it clear to Bre that you handed your iPod to her at her request.  And that she was the last person to see it.  Have her take you through the events because you know when you looked in you locker it wasn't there and you don't believe that story is true.  <br>  <br>  As she goes through her motions an tells you the time, my guess is her time line will not be able to match with what you know to be true.  after she is finished going through it, then let her know the information you have.  She's going to understand it looks like she had the ipod and she lost it.  You and I both know, there is no reason why a person wold have a friends IPod and instead of putting it in their hands, put it in a place where a person is not looking when they are right there in front of them.  It takes longer to put it in a locker when you aren't looking than handing it to you when you are in front of her.  <br>  <br>  Also if you know her parents. let them know you're looking for it and for them to let you know if they see it.  That way if your friend pops up with it at home, she will not be able to show her parents.  Only place she can use it is in her room.  That  ruins the purpose of having an ipod.|`|bC42lYYtaa	Tell her that you know she is lying, and tell her why you know she is lying, so she knows you aren't bluffing, and then tell you aren't playing around, you want your ipod back, because it wasn't in your locker, and she was the last person with it, it was her responsibility, and she needs to give it back.<br>  <br>  Threaten to the tell the principal.<br>  <br>  It's probably in her locker, so just go up to hers in between classes or something, it prob won't be in plain sight.<br>  So if she has a backpack or something tell her you are getting a piece of gum, and do some snooping.|`|xpQlzgkmaa	well if she said she put it in your locker she must have put it in the one next to your's. probably this is all i can think of so good luck with finding it and with your mom|`|kJFXxMeRaa	good question try asking my source and become a fan and post me the answer they give because i have lost my ipod before too|`|MaWUTYf6aa	well. idk...  maybe you should tell the principal and your parents.  they probably will understand.  anywayzz, if you get it back, it's worth it!|`|jj550T1Vaa	IDK don't give your i pod to other people or tell your dad cuz my dad does not get as mad as my mom

QUIZ9Fqxaa	YES. My gosh it breaks so easily. It comes off of its slider into halves. The screen cracks too. If you drop it at all from anywhere onto anything it will break.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ya, they let you replace it. But it is still annoying. Most people just switch phones.
r8HAHhgkaa	4ohms refers to the speaker's impedance. All this is is the amount of power needed to adequately drive the speakers. 4 ohms is very low and will need alot of power to drive well as they are very inefficient. typically high quality speakers have this impedance. If your current amp powers them fine then another set with the same impedance should work fine.

AQ4b4Iilaa	I despair when people advise others to buy the Nikon D40 without pointing out how limited it is.<br>  <br>  You'd be better off trading the D40 in to give yourself a better range of lenses.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	The AF 50mm lenses will not autofocus, nor with any other AF lens.<br>  <br>  If you want autofocus, you'll have to get the AF-S 50mm f/1.4, and it's considerably more expensive than its AF cousin.|`|tWoN22rRaa	AnwserMan is slightly mistaken. The 50mm 1.4D AF doesn't autofocus either. In fact no lens with the "AF" (sans -I or -S) designation will.<br>  <br>  There is however an newer version of this lens: the Nikkor 50mm 1.4G AF-S. This lens will in fact autofocus on your D40.<br>  <br>  50mm on a D40 is actually kinda long though. It's useful for certain work like portraits, but because of the smaller medium (and 1.5 crop factor* that results from that), 50mm is no longer the general purpose lens it was in the film days. With that in mind, you may want to look into the new 35mm 1.8 AF-S. This lens produces a view that is similar to what the 50mm would have on a film camera (or full frame digital like the D700 or D3). Making it useful for general photography. And at only US$200 MSRP, it costs less than half what the 50mm 1.4 AF-S does.<br>  <br>  The 35mm 1.8G won't be out until the beginning of next month. But some stores are already accepting pre-orders.<br>  <br>  * 50 x 1.5 = 75mm effective. 35mm x 1.5 = 52.5mm effective.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	No, they won't autofocus. Nor would you really need it either. I use an old 85mm f/1.4 AI-s lens perfectly with the D80. I dont care if it doesnt autofocus or works with the metering, cuz the subjects I shoot dont need that. Autofocus is important for shooting sports, but that's not what most people do with 50mm primes anyways.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	No. You need AF-S or AF-I lenses to auto focus with the D40. However, you can use it as a manual focus lens.|`|KbwintLyaa	1.8 can't autofocus with d40 or d60,but 1.4 AF can because it has a focus engine inside..

HY22vMOhaa	To find some prices you can go on <a href="http://us.creative.com/products/welcomenew.asp?category=213" rel="nofollow">http://us.creative.com/products/welcomen...</a> to see different creative players(Zen). For example the Zen V Plus is $90 for 4gb and $70 for 2gb, the Zen Mozaic is $60 bucks for 2gb, $80 for 4gb, $100 for 8gb and, 16gb is 150 bucks. There are different types other than these too. 4gbs holds 1,000 songs, 8gb hold 2,000 songs, and 16gbs hold 4,000 songs. Your probably not going to buy is online so you can buys these at Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. Do some research online and find the one that is right for you. There are also different mp3 players you can buy like Zune, Ipod, Samsung and more.

IoKjLtN9aa	No, actually you should turn your Wifi card "OFF"  for your flight. (It's illegal to have a wifi card on during a flight actually!) Very few flights do allow pay per byte but it's very expensive, and that's by a modem meaning only for laptops. <br>  <br>  Even if you had the iPhone you would have to turn off your cell phone reception.

AA11056614	Blu-ray will probably be around for 5-10 years. That said, so will DVD.<br>  <br>  The future isn't clear yet but it's still probable that DVD will remain the mainstream disk format with Blu-ray remaining what it is now, a premium price HD alternative.<br>  <br>  At the moment Blu-ray disks are ~30% more expensive than DVD and less than half the population in the US can benefit (you need at least a moderate sized HDTV to see any significant benefit, and a good surround sound system to perceive an audio benefit).<br>  <br>  The first improvement on Blu-ray MAY be 3D (which can be built into Blu-ray). Eventually a replacement for Blu-ray (Blu-ray 2?) will deliver higher bit depth and improved colour range and, eventually higher resolution ... but not for several years minimum and only as a high priced alternative for those willing to pay high prices and able to benefit.<br>  <br>  So ... feel safe to buy Blu-ray IF you have an HDTV and are willing to pay the higher prices required for both the player and disks.|`|UinOWcMUaa	More than likely 1 year 2 tops :)|`|cc3c991f430603e40938b020443e27a7aa	I think that if the technology sticks, it will be the technology for some time... probably a few years minimum.  It seems prices are dropping on the players and disks, so I believe that the technology will make its way into more homes and the manufacturers and studios will make a good return on it.  <br>  <br>  I believe next we will see a move toward wireless technology soon for all home theater components.  Also the next step for blu-ray will be some kind of wireless electronic/no disk versions.|`|bda90c576f1d500516702950d3dbb7ffaa	I think your safe to get one being that they still play standard DVDs. The next phaze is the BD live where you do not need a disk and you Blu-Ray player will pull a movie via an internet connection. <br>  <br>  Some new things to come are power panels that do things like charge cell phones and laptops by just setting the device on them. And also some talk about these being placed in the walls and painted over and not having to plug into an outlet to power TV's etc. <br>  <br>  Also the next generation of TVs are upon us as the introduction of OLEDs. <br>  <br>  No talk of Blu-Ray being replaced yet.|`|QekY4ycuaa	blu-rays will be around for atleast 4 years

V7fULXTeaa	Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip for Wii sticks with the basics. Ubisoft's game mimics EA's SSX series, putting you on a snowboard and giving you a variety of tasks (item collecting, tricks) to complete across several mountains. It handles smoothly with the Wii remote, but the Balance Board enhances the experience as you twist your body to jump, carve and grind your way down the track. Single-player has hundreds fun challenges and humorous moments (check out the spam emails) and the competitive four-player modes are great, even if you only use one Balance Board per race. We're glad that Shaun finally got an excellent snowboarding game worthy of his talents|`|ktbyKKK9aa	Yup. Especially the Wii version of the game. Shaun White Snowboarding on the Wii is alot better than the 360 and PS3 versions.

VlBncwFDaa	I've made my pre-order and I can't wait for it. I love the idea to carry lots of books and magazines anywhere without actually bringing the heavy books along with me. And I like the text-to-speech function, which means I can have my hand holding other things and eyes looking around but still reading (listening) the books. What a wonderful idea!<br>  <br>  You can read a good review here:<br>  <a href="http://www.speedreaderxreview.com/amazon-kindle-20-review-speed-readers-complete-thoughts-on-this-hot-new-device" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedreaderxreview.com/amazon...</a>|`|22HpFLCmaa	I ordered the Kindle 1 for my birthday. My birthday was on the 17th, I ordered on the 3rd. We are expecting it to arrive on the 2nd of March. I can't wait. I can carry so many books on the plane no hassle! Plus the book costs less! When I don't feel like reading, I can just have it read too me. I think it's an amazing deal. : )<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  I forgot to say they switched my order of Kindle 1 to Kindle 2 automatically when the second Kindle came out.

If you don't know what gb's are they are the amount of space. The more gb's the more room you have for music movies pictures etc. But its important to remember that just because you have an 8gb itouch dosent mean that you can use all of that space.

bR5r9DMZaa	you have to be in a wi-fi area. some wi-fi signals you could be picking up are from other homes. most families protect there own signal with a password. so basically go to a free wi-fi area or use your own families wi-fi signal when you know the password|`|p8mqgpWaaa	that just means that that network is someone else's and they put a password so that no one else can use it. the only way to get internet is if you have your own wireless network or if you go to like starbucks or some place that has it free

nNAAClOqaa	The Voyager is awesome. It's so easy to text on. I was debating the same thing. The Dare is kind of hard to text on. It's like the iPhone, too hard to text in my opinion. If you are a big texter, then you should get the Voyager. It really is a great phone. The price is also less. Make sure to get a cover, though. I had a bad experience with tripping and scratching the silver plating. You also need a invisible screen protector. Personally, I think that the Voyager is one of the best phones out there for the time being.|`|qz3Vgkhqaa	there is a new phone coming out called the lg versa. it is a touch screen phone like the dare. but it also has a detachable keyboard. pretty cool. i think it is coming out in march. check it out. it should be in stores soon.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?" rel="nofollow">http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?</a> newsID=14897&model=LG+Versa+VX9600|`|99HoClOTaa	both are great for texting, but if you have big fingers, go with the voyager, allthough i think the voyager is over-rated and could use a few new things, its fine.

N4IvZmPiaa	Buy what you can comfortably afford. Don't bother saving for the next plateau because by the time you get that money together there is another plateau you will want to wait for! If you buy a D300 today, it will perform extremely well for you for at least the next 3 to 5 years unless you are an everyday-all day shooter and wear it out!<br>  <br>   The difference between the D700 and the D300 is a big leap, and unless you have the lenses to take advantage of that leap, you are wasting your money. The best camera body in the world can still take poor images if the glass out in front of it isn't up to the job.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	The Nikon D300 is a superb camera but the D700 deserves a bit more.<br>  The Nikon D700 is equipped with a full frame FX sensor (36.0 x 23.9) while The D300 on the other hand uses the APS-C sensor (23.6 x 15.8). The D700 lower noise level in turn translates to the D700 being able to operate at a higher ISO level than the D300. The D700 can operate as high as ISO 25,600 while the D300 can go up to ISO 6,400<br>  Personnally I would go with Nikon D700<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BTG3BE?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001BTG3BE" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BTG...</a><br>  but if you are on budget is Nikon D300 is an excellent DSLR to get<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR5YA8?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VR5YA8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR5...</a>|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Your decision should be based on several factors, your budget, lenses you currently own, and accessories you may want to aquire later on.<br>  <br>  - Buy what you can afford right now. Tommorow's camera won't take today's pictures<br>  - If you currently own DX lenses and are unwilling to go out and buy new lenses, the D700 would be a waste since it is only using the center part of its excellent full frame sensor.<br>  - if you go and buy the d700, you probably won't have enough money to buy anything else. If you buy an excellent camera body just to stick a crap lens on it, it certainly doesnt do the camera justice. Get the D300 instead, and spend more on quality glass and accessories.|`|KbwintLyaa	If you are really into night time photography, get a D700 for better ISO results because it has bigger sensor(full frame).if you think that you don't want perfection but good results,D300 is also a good performer.But if i were you i would wait for a while(D400 maybe coming soon) or get the D90 which performs almost the same as D300.The question is:Do you want full frame one like D700 and D3x which pro guys use therefore the lenses you need gets more expensive for better results or middle size ones such as D300,D90?So its up to you...|`|i5OVORXgaa	If you insist on getting one of these two... save a little shorter and get the D300, then save some more and get some nice lenses.|`|s1awA1jhaa	I think you should get the D700. The features are better than the D300 and at the end of the day, your saving up will pay off with great results from the D700. Good luck on your decision!

jPeySdTSaa	I have had this same problem in the past.  What you need to do is go into itunes, click on your ipod in the sidebar, click "check for update", it should say there is new firmware available (2.2.1)and click update.  That should solve the problem.|`|Oj1eYTyBaa	I just figure this out too. You MUST download the iPhone 2.2.1 version in able to get any apps or games. To do this, you have to plug you iTouch in and go under neath the "devices" toolbar on the left. Then where it says update, click it and make sure you've got all pictures and music on your library on the computer so later on you can sync it back on the iPod. You'll have to pay some money but at least you get your apps. This may take a few hours to download. Good luck! Enjoy the apps! XD|`|AA10332688	2 possible reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Not on the right firmware. Upgrade to 2.2.1<br>  <br>  2) App is not compatible with the iPod, I don't know why, but some apps just don't work with them.  Only solution is to buy an iPhone or wait until an update.
9rvaMQ0eaa	wow ur desperate

Try calling again and asking for the LOCAL station WCIU because they have a separate listing for local affiliates by zip code.<br>  <br>  Tip, you can always try asking a regular CSR instead of a sales agent by calling 1-800-531-5000.|`|838bf62c54d3b8485e9f70388fa64a81aa	If you're in the Chicago market, you'll get WCIU-26 and both WGN-ch 9 and WGN America.<br>  <br>  If you're outside the area, you won't get WCIU no matter how much you try.
IoKjLtN9aa	It happens with every hard drive, and other external drives. Even flash drives! The space is taking up by formating (Not necessarily software) , When a company has 1 Gig of storage normally about at least 0.05-0.2GB go to formating, For example at my feet there is a 1 TB external drive, but really I'm only getting about 900GB's. There's no way you can free up space, but don't feel ripped off, it's bound to happen with whatever device you have.|`|p4fRULvJaa	I don't think so. Every single electronic device does that. In reality, you get about 7% less space then advertised. But, hey, how attractive would it be to have a commercial that said: "The new iPod Touch. In 7.26 GB, 14.98 GB, and 29.47 GB,"?|`|5rw7qvdhaa	Its because it needs space for system items like the browser,internet settings,etc...<br>  <br>  For Instance, my Sansa Fuze is a 8gb but only 7.60gb...<br>  On my iPod nano 2nd generation its a 2gb but only has 1.70gb|`|T9f9WDb9aa	Yep, my ipod touch is 8GB and it turns out the capacity it 7.2!!! i agree, its disgraceful|`|LSkeAPBIaa	Ugh yea I have an 8 gb touch but it really only has 7.1 gb. Good question|`|eaLuDhyfaa	Yes, it is a rip-off.  The reason why you get less space then they say you get is because the software included that allows you to play the songs takes up some space.  While this is essential to have, they should not market the iPod as having 8 GB if the software it needs to run makes it less than 7.  They should market it as having less than 7 GB, so that people are aware when spending the money of what they are actually buying.

kL6amV8gaa	The Omnia has 2 versions...the i910 and the i900.  The i900 is a GMS phone which can be activated to a company like AT&T and T-Mobile.  The i910 is a CDMA phone that can only be activated to Verizon(as of now).  Both run off Windows Mobile 6.1 and it is rumored that they are both compatible with Windows Mobile 6.5 but as of now that has not been confirmed.  The Omnia HD runs of Symbian OS and has a screen resolution of 480x800.  Because this runs on the Symbian OS it is VERY VERY likely that it wont come preloaded with as many features as the Windows Mobile versions for GSM and CDMA.  The Omnia HD is strictly GSM (AT&T and T-Mobile) as of now but the regular Omnia started as a GSM phone and landed with Verizon.  As of now no one knows weather a CDMA company like Verizon or Sprint will get the Omnia HD but we do know Verizon usually stays away from the Symbian OS.  Most of Verizon's PDAs run on Windows Mobile or Blackberry OS.  I hope that helped.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something below that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information below for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often. <br>    <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ... It's PINK, but it uses a $49.50 Series G Rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery.<br>  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber-shot%20DSC-W150%2FR%20Digital%20Camera:1995337750;_ylc=X3oDMTB0bjZzaWNuBF9TAzk2NjMyOTA3BHNlYwNmZWVkBHNsawNlbGVj">http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=3462&review=sony+cybershot+w150" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau...</a> ...<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best.  The second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. <br>   <br>  Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.  Once you select a camera, read all about it in the owner's manual.

Some come with Wii sports, others with Wii fit and board and others with other games. As for extra things, well if you want to play multiplayer two controllers is a good idea. If you want to do the Wii fit then you need the board (if you don't get that with the console)<br>  <br>  You can buy extra things (Wheel, Gun and so on) which are for certain games, but you don't need them and in some cases there are probably just a waste of money|`|S5yDQ4ZHaa	well if you want to play with friends a remote and if you want to play boxing on wii sports with friends you will need a nun chuck and if you want more accuracy for the wiimotes you will need to get wii motion plus witch is coming out soon.you don't actually need games use twilight hack and get burned games for free.if you want to view pictures you will need a sd card not more then 3 gigs wii does not support it.If you might like to play over the internet get a router or a wifi connector made by Nintendo and you can also play ds online and a internet connection is very useful to get newer channels like internet channel check me out channel Nintendo channel

Xpp9h2Nbaa	Well it depends what games you are looking for. Ipod touch games have many fun games but they aren't games like gun games or action games you might buy for a playstation or an xbox. the ipod games r things like games u would find on mindjolt.com for example cube runner where u tilt the ipod the move the ship and aviod hitting the cubes. not that fun sounding but a good game when bored in the car or something. If you just want games to be playing at home or with ur friends then use your money for the console games.|`|jVi1uJ8Laa	PRICING:<br>  It depends. For mobile gaming(I don't mean phones, I mean PSP and DS) it is awesome. An XBOX 360 game or PS3 game brand new are $60. Brand new PS2 or XBOX game is $50. Brand new DS game is $30 and PSP game is $40, not like they ever make em anymore anyways. Brand new good graphics console style game for iPod Touch is usually $10. They usually give 5-6 hours of playing time.<br>  GAMING:<br>  The best console style games for iPod Touch are Hero of Sparta and Brothers in Arms Hour of Heroes. Here's some screen shots:<br>  <a href="http://xboxoz360.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/hero-of-sparta-6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://xboxoz360.files.wordpress.com/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://iphonemanual.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/brothersinarms.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://iphonemanual.info/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>  <br>  Hero of Sparta is iPhone's God of War, except it was $10 when it came out and is now $5.99.<br>  BiA: Hour of Heroes was $10 on release, and is now $5.99.<br>  <br>  FINAL:<br>  If you want a hardcore, 50 mission game or so, iPod Touch is not for you. If you want a 10 mission game then go with the iTouch. For more for your money console wins. But they both provide good value.|`|vLabXe9Raa	theres only a cuople of good ones such as touch grind and feild runner. but the other ones are like joke games just for entertainment

WARNING! this will erase her ipod and sync it with your library. all you have to do is make sure that she just syncs her ipod with her computer again. ALSO, to import her purchases to your library, you have have to AUTHORIZE your computer (you can do this by clicking STORE and then AUTHORIZE COMPUTER in the itunes bar. an ipod can only have like 3 authorize comps that can play their purchases. then just sync your ipod to your library and youll have her purchases in your ipod :) this MIGHT work, if not, there is no other way... unless she just burns CDs for you and then you import those CDs into your comp

AA11217353	Yes, that phone is a pretty decent messaging phone.  It is an entry level phone that is targeted towards teens and heavy texters.  I am sure you will enjoy this phone.  I will say, however, that if you keep breaking phones, you may want to consider getting insurance and/or getting a rugged phone.  I can't really say if this phone is the right choice for you.  To say that, I will need you to provide information on what are you are looking for in your new phone and how you will use it.|`|8XS7xeiXaa	i've heard it's not that great, but if you want a phone somewhat like it, but a slider phone, i would try the samsung propel, i've had it since the end of november, & i absolutely love it!|`|4cVU7CoZaa	my friend has that phone and it sucks...<br>  <br>  i would recommend the iPhone (i know you dont want it) <br>  but i would try it out...<br>  or the blackjack<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	Looks nice.

3DCPcZLQaa	No, you cant do it yourself. the iPod 8G is built too small and thin and was built for an 8G hard drive which is smaller than the 30G. i got the iPod Touch 8G too and it actually holds a lot of songs and i have a ton of applications. If you really want more space im sure you can go to the Apple store and buy the 30G iPod or see if they can try to replace the 8G with the 30G. But the two are actually built differently n they have different models that have more applications that can only fit on certain GB's. Hope this helps!|`|k5557KW2aa	no you cannot because it uses a flash drive that is much smaller that a harddrive and some models of flash drive are soldered to the ipod touch motherboard<br>  <br>  basically an expierenced thechnician would have trouble doing that and defitnatly not with a harddrive<br>  <br>  <br>   basically its not possible|`|tFXVTT8iaa	I dont think you can :S<br>  It is unusual putting 30+ GB on an iPod Touch.<br>  And...

F2znLWdWaa	Umm... lets see I used a 1gig on my cousins wii, and a 2 gb on mine so they both work fine. <br>  <br>  Heres what you do. If you have all the files ready, insert the SD card into the wii. Start Tp and make a new file(saved data). then restart the wii. Go to your SD cad from the options menu and copy over your Tp file with the hack. start Tp again and click on the hack file. Once in the game, talk to the man in front of you to start the hack. <br>  <br>  If you need more help, just email me^^|`|oZgDxBTGaa	This website will help you, I also used it for using homebrew on my wii, check => www.wiibrew.org<br>  <br>  I don't have Zelda TP either, I rented it once and used the hack, I found out that I'd better install the Homebrew Channel at once so I wouldnt need to use the Twilight Hack anymore. Read everything on the website, it's simple to understand
ozM1rX7Iaa	You have to have Zelda. If you don't, just rent it or borrow it, or better, buy it.|`|kgTPnjhkaa	i really dont think theirs any way to but The Twilight Hack is currently the only free, safe and publicly available way to enable Homebrew on the Nintendo Wii. It is executed by playing a specially designed savegame for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess that loads and executes a Homebrew application or installer from the SD card in the Wii's SD slot. <br>  <br>  Inside the zip file you will find versions of the hack for all three regions (USA, Europe, and Japan). You may copy the whole folder containing all of them to your SD card, your Wii will only recognize the savegame for your region. <br>  <br>  For USA users: when entering the savegame loading screen in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, you will be presented with two savegames of which only one will work (the other one does no harm, but only halt the game). The easiest way to find out which one to use is to look up the last digit of the text on the inner circle of the data (usually bottom of disc) surface of the game disk (it's either 0 or 2).|`|oZgDxBTGaa	I'm sorry but you'll need the Zelda Disc ._. but after you install the homebrew channel, you wont need the CD anymorefor installing homebrew :D|`|b4mhcOy6aa	buy the game and keep it safe after u use it lol

jLTDqVHsaa	Mega-pixels really has nothing to do with video quality.  The highest-resolution HD video format is 1440x1080 HD, which is a little over 1 MP.  This means that for video, even if the camera HAS more pixels, it doesn't USE them for video.  The extra pixels are for photos.<br>  <br>  To pack in more pixels for photos, they have to make the pixels smaller, which means they can't capture light as easily, which actually has an ADVERSE effect on video quality, especially in low-light conditions.<br>  <br>  On the XL-H1s, there are fewer pixels per chip, but even then, there are THREE CHIPS.  This system used in professional camcorders produces great color.<br>  <br>  In short, professional camera operators aren't worried about the resolution of PHOTOS that can be taken with their cameras.  They just want great video.  That's why the XL-H1s doesn't bother with a high megapixel count; it's a machine built for great video.<br>  <br>  The HF-S10 uses a highly-compressed MPEG-4 format on flash memory.  The XL-H1s uses HDV on tape, a format much more commonly used for professional applications.  It also is supported by more editing programs.<br>  <br>  On top of that, the XL-H1s offers a crazy amount of manual control options that are extremely easy to access.  It also features interchangeable lenses.  It offers XLR cable audio input for professional microphones.  It offers easy manual audio control.<br>  <br>  In short, the smaller, lighter camera is NOT better.  The bigger one uses superior video processing, has a superior lens, uses a superior video format, has superior features, and offers manual controls FAR superior to the smaller one.  The XL-H1s is built for professional use.  The HF-S10, even though it is a nice little machine, is not suitable for professional use.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	the 9'000 one has flourite lens , and you will find that it has more advanced technology in relation to picture and size
Sq1p3zJSaa	Do the math, that's 1,920 pixels (horizontally) and 1,080 (vertically) and you get 2,073,600 pixels. An HD camera is far better then a regular camcorder because those pixels are compressed making the picture very crisp and contrasted compared to a regular camera. A 1920x1080 is equivalent to a 30 inch television or monitor. Now 30 inches of clarity captured from the lenses of your camera most likely a little over 2 inches, you tell me how good that is.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	camcorder pixels are different from digi camera pixels.<br>  <br>  basically 0.8 mega pixels is considered a starter for camcorders, but least 3 mega pixels is a starter for digi cameras, because digi cameras have still pixels, while camcorders have dynamic pixels.<br>  <br>  so does pixels matter? ofcoz, higher pixels you get, resolution is higher. but do remmeber that camcorders pixels are different from digi cams', so like 5 mega pixels might be low for a digi cam, but SUPER HIGH FOR A CAMCORDER.|`|tl8e4KyGaa	Yes because the more the better quality.|`|Ev6pe7Dgaa	YES u need like 1gb at the least for a camera
qWicVoU9aa	Sure you can.  But the internet is an always on function with the iPhone and when you get a 1000 page bill for $4000 because you do not have the correct plan on it then AT&T will bear no responsibility towards being lenient with you
Z0odTlyQaa	Uhhh, still with the Chipods people?!?!? <br>  <br>  I've been spreading word on Y!A about these for awhile.<br>  <br>  Be really careful buying unbranded mp3 or mp4 players or touch screens from ebay, ESPECIALLY Hong Kong. I bought one that claimed to be 8GB but it had some kind of memory hack and was only 1GB. Which I am actually fine with because I only paid $15. But I had to reformat the player because it went haywire after about a day (now it works fine as a 1 gig). I felt really silly because with one quick search on the internet about these players I found a LOT of information about the common practice of selling these hacked mp3 or mp4 players. See link below for more info on the hacked players.<br>  THIS IS A VERY COMMON PRACTICE ON EBAY (Selling hacked players. When it arrives, all is fine and in a few days, or once you add enough music to it, it freaks out. For that reason, people also often leave positive feedback before they even realize anything is wrong- I did!).<br>  <br>  The seller of the auction you gave has 4 negative feedbacks in the last month, and my guess is this isn't their only ebay user name. Many of these guys are HUGE powersellers, so even if they have 67 negative feedbacks in a month, their percentage will only be to 99.1 or something. Ebay has finally been taking a stand and banning these people, and that's probably why this seller has only been a member for 3 months.|`|3zM7JptVaa	nano... the picture looks like they just took an itouch and messed with the size. and if price doesnt matter i would just get the itouch from apple. but if not.. then the nano if you are just using it to listen to music|`|tJUDxmO6aa	hmmmmmmmmm i'd go with the nano...<br>  <br>  actually, if price doesnt matter, then just get a normal iTouch. its like 10 times better than the nano and the clone put together <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222113631AAm3jR8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|zfKzLFgxaa	1) nanochromatic isnt the name of the ipod, its just a term that the marketing team uses to describe it because it has so many colors. but i had the new nano and i didnt like it so i bought a nano from the previous generation. but i do like the touch. if you want to be able to browse the internet and stuff like that then get the ipod touch but if you just want a small music player, then i would recommend the nano|`|BxkBXsocaa	Go 4 the best then... get a 32GB iPod Touch, not the clone, since u can afford it... yeah, u can an incredible lots of stuff with this one & that's why I'm giving up my PSP.|`|BftuXp1Iaa	Ipod touch|`|CelHLdg4aa	or you can get one free here:<a href="http://www.rewards1.com/index.php?referrer_id=668547" rel="nofollow">http://www.rewards1.com/index.php?referr...</a>|`|jVi1uJ8Laa	Nano.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Kate why are you looking for an 8-10mega pixel camera?  The number of mega pixels has little to do with the quality of the photo!!!!<br>  <br>  The single most important part in any camera is the lens.  There are many totally crap 10mega pixel cameras out there that take rubbish photo's because they have a rubbish lens!<br>  <br>  Walk into a camera shop and when the sales person asks you what you are looking for, and you say an 8-10mp camera, he mentally rubs his hands together in glee because he immediately knows that you know nothing what so ever about photography and he can palm any old rubbish off onto you!|`|pC2jGRKraa	If you're going to spend that much money on an SX10 you may as well pay a little more and get a Powershot G9 or G10 (14/15 MP).

r97pNcztaa	well in Limewire, you go to the search box and type in the name of the song. roll over the song and when you see that it has a lot of information like the name of the song, album, producer, things like that you double click it. you should look down and see that it is loading, once it is loading you click it and press preview and make sure you can hear the song. then you wait for it to fully download then you doble-click it and it should start playing once it does you go to your library and look in your playlist section and you should see the song. then you click save as and pick a folder (choose something you can access from anywhere, like on my comp. i click the public folder and click on pulic downloads and save it in there) once youve chosen a folder and saved it, go to itune and look up near the top left hand folder and you should see Library look under it and you should see Music click on it and then click on File on the top lefthand corner and click import. Then that folder thingy should come up and go to the folder in which you saved it under and double click it. then you should see your song come up. then go under File again and click sync (name of Ipod) ipod and after it syncs you should be able to see and hear your song on your ipod. ( don't forget to plug in your ipod)<br>  <br>  I know its long but this is the only way i can get it to work|`|YHIFlsvoaa	Downloading Music:<br>  I do not recommend downloading from Limewire because lots of people have been getting virus' from it.

After that double clip the file to listen to them on itunes and listen to all of them then go to your purchased and put a check on all the songs you want on there and sync them to your ipod or mp3 or what ever you have and there you go.   :):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)...|`|X0X5I75xaa	the only way u can put the songs into ur ipod is through i-tunes, coz it supports the i-tunes format only. <br>  when the page of ur ipod appears after connecting to ur pc, import those files through it and the songs will b converted and played in the ipod.

Except The P3 is more cheaper to the ipod and has pretty much the same features. And if you want the iphone buy the the Chromatic.

5HfuI3MEaa	no
oZgDxBTGaa	Yes, I'm sure of it since i had a wired connection b4 using a wireless one. the wired one is about 3 times faster and doesn't fail as much as the wireless one. However you'll need your wii near the computer or a very long wire if you want to use the wired connection ;)|`|AA11238814	Not if it's the same internet. They will work at exactly the same speed. Sorry =[|`|9roHz7ZTaa	A wired internet source will generally be faster than wireless. However, if you go with a wired source, you will have to buy the LAN adapter for the Wii, and I think that goes for over $50 in stores.
BqXqfZMpaa	Yes, but only in certain areas for now. They are still rolling it out and are not 100% 3G (like AT&T, for example). They have have both 3G/EDGE, so if you don't get 3G, you usually get EDGE. What's the difference? 3G is super fast and EDGE is fast. <br>  <br>  You can check on this map if to see if your area is covered: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://coverage.t-mobile.com/default.aspx?MapType=Data" rel="nofollow">http://coverage.t-mobile.com/default.asp...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  In my personal experience with T-Mobile using an HTC G1, I got 3G/EDGE 65/35.  I felt the 35% of the time on EDGE wasn't unbearable, but rather.. occasionally annoying.  <br>  <br>  However, paying less for service (I'd estimate about 25%), which you definitely do with T-Mobile, offset that for me. <br>  <br>  I had both for many years and I would say the customer service of both carriers is extremely equal (which I'd rate both as relatively good and getting slightly worse). <br>  <br>  Ultimately, in deciding between ATT/T-mo it would come down to the phone for me. The differences in service, price, coverage aren't significant enough between the two and I think having the right phone is critical in achieving phone satisfaction. <br>  <br>  Which, by the way, if you want to keep your Iphone, I'd go with ATT b/c even if you unlock it and use it with T-Mobile, you will only be able to get EDGE speed for now. In order to get 3G on T-mobile you have to use a T-mobile phone (and not an unlocked other carrier phone). <br>  <br>  Also, to get the most out of the Iphone, I'd say jailbreak it and get an unlimited ATT plan.

akvrwpywaa	First of all, check all your cable connections.<br>  Since it's a Magnavox, I'm guessing it's fairly likely that it's a CRT.  If that's the case, it may have been magnetized, in which case you'll want to degauss it (if turning it on and off a couple times doesn't fix the problem, then you might want to take it into a TV shop to have it degaussed).<br>  Otherwise, just set the tint, color, brightness, what not to the middle settings, or if there's a reset feature, use that.
DWBN7wDbaa	I have been using P2P programs for over 5 years now, and I highly suggest not using limewire. I can also say that WinMX is still by far the best one out of all of them. The original owners gave up on WinMX, and the community came together and got it back up. And now it has more features than before.<br>  <br>  Unlike Limewire, WinMX protects you from the RIAA/MPAA by blocking them from even getting on the network, it removes all fake files from your search results so you never get fake files, and it's fast and easy to use and NO SPYWARE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patchwinmx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.patchwinmx.com</a>|`|AA11877240	sounds like your ISP has blocked you.<br>  Have you exceeded your download limit?|`|4NcshCDvaa	Limewire gave my computer like 40 million viruses and only killed it. <br>  <br>  I would suggest getting off it...before you lose your computer.|`|ERo2gNxUaa	Have you updated your virus protection recently, did you get a new computer, are you using a different wireless network, did you get a new firewall. These are all questions you need to ask yourself and address. I use limewire and this happens to me all the time, some days it will work great and some days it wont i just have to use itunes and pay. The next day i will get on and no problems. If you find out it was one of the problems that i said above then let me know and i will help you fix it, but otherwise just wait a day or two and try again. By the way limewire isnt illegal, otherwise it wouldnt be on the internet to begin with. Its no different than letting your neighbor borrow a cd. Its a file sharing program, it just so happens that there are alot of people to share with. haha|`|rqJSk1omaa	Don't use limewire it is bad for your computer and your network might have booted you. Look in you shared folder and delete it. Even when you have closed limewire, the program will can still share you music. Uploading songs is what people get in trouble for. I deleted limewire over a year ago and some of their stuff is still lingering on my computer. It is hard to get rid of it all. Get a different music thing. utorrent.com and pirate bay are safer and less hated then limewire.  I don't download music, but my friends do.|`|xHxUCs1Haa	well its obviously letting you on the normal interenet so there cant be a connection problem.<br>  you could'av downloaded a faulty file :|<br>  limewire is bad for that!<br>  very bad and you have to scan everything before opening<br>  and know which ones are OK to download<br>  aswell limewire is illegal, so you may wanna get rid of it and stick to buying CDS ha<br>  but if you wanna carry on downloading illegally id uninstall limewire and download a thing called frost wire. it works exactly the same it just connects easier. try this and see if it works.<br>  <br>  as for itunes i cant help you because i dont use it but id look on the ITunes website <br>  uninstalll your existing itunes and make sure you have the latest version which is downloadable on <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/</a><br>  <br>  heres some troubleshooting on their website which might help<br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/store/connect/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/stor...</a><br>  from what youve said id say your problem is on this page<br>  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1527" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1527</a><br>  <br>  but you might have to check it out for yourself.<br>  <br>  you may also of exceeded your download limit (unless of course you have unlimited)<br>  therefore they may of blocked you<br>  but any good provider would inform you if you went over<br>  and some dont tell you and just make you pay for the extra downloads afterwards!<br>  youll have to contact your internet provider to find that out.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|jj550T1Vaa	LIME WIRE IS ILLEGALL I MIGHT TAKE THIS QUESTION OFF OF THE INTERNET

You could visit another person's town and get their fruit (each town has it's own native fruit) and it will sell for a lor more than the fruit in your town. It will take a while, but it is worth a shot. Alos, try buying turnips from the turnip lady on Sunday. Sometimes, Tom Nook bys them for A LOT. Or, you could cheat and hack like the second guy said, but I'm sure some of the cheats and hacks out there will crash your system or make it have glitches. Hope I helped.

UsOmE2zWaa	Keyboards are cool, I have the NV2, but they are slower. My brother has the LG Dare (Touch screen) and he can text faster than I can because you don't have to wait for the buttons to come back up. Also if you text in class the teacher can't hear a clicking sound ;). The touch screen wont wear out unless you really smash the screen in, but that is really hard to do. The actual keyboard's buttons would die out first because there are actual moving parts. I'm not sure if your phone company carries this phone but the LG voyager has a touch screen on the front (like an LG dare or iPhone) and then you can open it like a laptop and it has a keyboard like an NV! so it has a keyboard and a touch screen solving both your problems! hope this helps you and good luck on your new phone!|`|y3h4oAMxaa	its ok about your question being long lol. its actually a good idea so people know exactly what youre wanting. anyway i have the scoop and i think its great. it has a really cool keypad, a music player and chatting.  i would go with that or the delve.<br>  good luck:))

tHjBr4L4aa	Most likely the "D" stand for Digital, but camera manufacturers can use whatever designations they wish.  After all, what does the "X" or "S" stand for?   It's all marketing and regional appeal.  After all, the camera's sold with alphanumeric names in some counties are Rebels in the USA.  One Canon is actually sold as the "Kiss" in Japan, a name guaranteed to keep consumers from flocking to it in the USA.<br>  <br>  Nikon, Canon, Sony, Pentax, and other makers each use their own naming system for their camera line.  Pentax, for example, has a couple of models with identical names to their 35mm predecessors, but they just added a "D" to the name to show that it's digital.  Nikon uses single digits (D3), for it's professional line, double digits (D60) for it's amateur models, and triple digits (D300) for their pro-sumer cameras.  It's just like car makers with their LE, XL, SI, XT, LTD, XE, and so on.|`|oboe5c4Waa	digital. as in digital slr|`|i5OVORXgaa	It stands for digital.

You might have to unlock your ipod.|`|GWSKslriaa	Mine does the same thing, and I have an Ihome 1st generation.  I think that to get it to work, you would have to buy a new docking station, because the one you have now wasn't made to support the ipod touch.  I'd invest in a new docking station.|`|BPF5ZacIaa	Your cable might be damaged or just old... this happened mine and i juast had 2 buy a new wire for it!

3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	I would say it is down to how much heat is there, if not much at the height you propose to mount it, then go for it ! If you skin starts to sear and your flesh drops off, then probably not a bright idea.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Not because of the heat - but because the heat would be consistently present. The heat will dissipate around the TV but because of the LCD technology - the screen isn't real build for heat. They are a lot more fragile than CRT.<br>  <br>  The liquid crystals may be affected by the heat. Have a look at your manual to see recommended max/min temp for your tv to work in.|`|AA11503051	Hi James<br>  <br>  I've seen lots of people do it. I've also seen people put TV over fireplaces. 9 times out of 10 there are no issues.<br>  <br>  You will however find that the manual advises against putting a TV above any heat source.<br>  <br>  If you go ahead, and a fault develops in 6 months time, you'll probably find that your warranty is invalid as you placed it above a heat source.<br>  <br>  Your shout basically!<br>  <br>  Boris|`|YuWLcExJaa	It will be perfectly fine. Maybe fit a radiator cover if you are concerned. Cold and moisure condensing is more of a threat.

Ab1vrd6Taa	I'm not using it but I have a friend whose been with them for a few mths now and he swears its for real. I'm evening thinking of going over to them.
qWicVoU9aa	There are no truly free sites as cell phone records are NOT public records. To get the information requires that records searches be performed by a legitimate agency and they DO charge for this. You will find all kinds of sites that claim to be "free" but all you will get for free is the city and state. I have tried my personal cell phone number in many of these sites and they do not give correct info even at that. They usually come back and tell me that it is a landline number, which I know it is not|`|PmkXPisEaa	Yeah, unfortunately, you can only get this info by paying a small, one-time fee. That's because the information is private, but luckily, many sites do have the information if you are willing to pay for it. Good luck!
aLp1ySZ9aa	My Fiance has one and she loves it. The mobile 3G internet on it is great for when we're on the road our out of the house. It's a really nice phone. It's like the iphone except it isn't extremely overpriced. You should visit your local cell provider's store and just try one out. The touchscreen keyboard can take a little while to get used to, but that's about it.
6vY9Ys1daa	Only the iPhone 3G works strong internationally. If you have a iPhone 1G, then maybe it wouldn't be as strong or it might not work at all. Evere seen that AT&T commercial explaining the "More Bars in More Places" Slogan? That's because most international countries use 3G Wireless up link towers for there phones, so that' why the iPhone 3G can work in a lot of countries.|`|yTmERGw7aa	you would have to get it unlocked from the UK. Unlocking a phone means that u can put any pay as you go sim card in the phone and it should all work.
RmLabASeaa	It's pretty good. But it does have some problems too.<br>  Like the sound isn't always good, like you have to talk loudly and very clearly. No echo problems really. <br>  Now the battery time is the thing that I hate. It doesn't last long you have to keep charging it. uh i hate that part.<br>  <br>  It does have cool features and the ful keyboard.<br>  hope this helped.

kgTPnjhkaa	What you need to do is beat Tabbu and then after that get Wolf, Toon link and Jiggly puff. To get 100% you need to get as many trophies as you can. Get trophies from those blue and yellow boxes or turn your enemies into trophies.it will take a while but you will eventually do it|`|y8HKAhBFaa	Hmm its hard to get 100% my friend got up to 86%. You need to collect every single thing and box and not miss one thing to fight. So its really impossible to beat... HF if you want to look for what items you miss like a stupid music thing,<br>  -EC|`|haLQ4bCnaa	It is indeed hard, but not impossible, as I have done it. you need to find every yellow box in every level.

dUyBF4yOaa	yea when you opened up your rock band 2 box you should have got a usb hub... its about the size of the guitar usb dongle. What it basically does is take up on usb port and splits it into 4 more. The guitar dongles also split into one more hub so you can keep extending from there. I myself own the 60gb ps3 and never had to use the hub because i had 4 usb ports. If you threw away your hub by accident go out and buy one from wal mart they are about 8 bucks. You DO NOT have to buy the special rock band branded one any hub will do fine. <br>  <br>  If you have any more quesitons you can email or IM me at:<br>  redlightning7@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED
xG5ZlJDqaa	I saw the D80 (body only) for $650 over boxing week. The lens alone costs about $300. When bought as a kit, it should be close to around $850.
rEWZWZi5aa	yes you can play music<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Guillemot brought us the Hercules XPS-210 and XPS-510 speaker sets, and represented great value for money with a sub-$200 price tag, considering the quality of the sound. This new offering from Guillemot appears under the Thrustmaster banner, and is aimed specifically at the console gamers and home cinema buffs.<br>  <br>  Bearing an uncanny resemblance to the XPS-510 Hercules speakers (in fact, the packaging does bear the Hercules logo), the Thrustmaster 5.1 sound system is equipped with an external control unit, which contains a full Dolby Digital AC3 decoder, and supports Dolby Digital, Dolby Surround, Dolby Pro Logic and Pro Logic II. Also present in this control unit are both S/PDIF optical and coaxial digital inputs, as well as RCA analog inputs. There is no direct connectivity for PC sound cards, however. Such connections are possible, through the use of various non-supplied adaptors, but as Guillemot point out, these speakers are not aimed at PC users.<br>  <br>  Setup was straightforward, with a G9 connection from the control unit to the subwoofer. The control unit automatically detects the presence of various sound signal types. There are no real equaliser controls, except for the bass levels on the subwoofer, which we needed to max out. Also supplied is a remote control, allowing for the volume control of each speaker, and the standard system controls.<br>  <br>  The sound quality was great, as were the original XPS range. The high tones are clear but not harsh, and mid-tones were full of depth. We did notice, however, that the bass didn’t seem to pack the punch we were expecting. Even when watching the opening sequence to Armageddon on DVD, while the full 5.1 positional audio was convincing and ‘cinematic’ in atmosphere, the rich rumblings of a decent bass sound were lacking.<br>  <br>  A different experience was to be had when jumping into some hard and fast GameCube action – the speakers provided some of the best sounding console gaming we have experienced for a system in this price range.<br>  <br>  This speaker system is a great offering from Guillemot, and at a reasonable price to boot.
qWicVoU9aa	It sounds as though you have an issue with the oubound server.  If you have AT&T service this server name should be cwmx.com if you know where to check the settings.  If not you will need to contact Apple as they troubleshoot email issues, not AT&T.  The number for Apple is 1-800-My-iPhone (1-800-694-7466)|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	If you don't have enough credit, it won't go through.

e79a6ead0b057ff9d302561a7fd12b9caa	They don't zap the SIM card. The SIM card has a unique ID called an IMSI. The phone talks to the network's Home Location Register (HLR) to authenticate you and get your settings. If the operator has disabled you in the HLR then the SIM is useless.<br>  <br>  Look up IMSI, GSM, HLR on wikipedia for more info|`|YuWLcExJaa	Your simcard has a unique number assigned to it, just like it's own phone number. When you switch on your phone, the software connects it to the mobile operators cell situated in masts and tall buildings. The mobile operator gives your number the permission to dial/recieve via these cells. They block you or allow you to connecting to thier network and use the service. Just like wifi and padlocks on your laptop/games console when it searches for a wireless lan. The wifi owner has control.<br>  <br>  The electricity company can flick a switch and turn off the electricity, it's just the same thing.<br>  <br>  There is always google my friend ;o)|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	It's easy for them to do a number of things with the phones & SIM's from their end. For example, when your phone is stolen, they can "block" the card, so no one else can use it. Same with the mobile itself. I think it'd be quicker if you just paid your bill, so you don't have to find out.|`|AA11256390	The best way for this to be answered is to have a read of this one, it's from Wikipedia and explains fully what they are and exactly what they do<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_Identity_Module" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_...</a>

jH003ElKaa	i think u should go 4 guitar hero world tour it is 1 of the best games i have, and i have alot!! i have both rock band,and GH i preferably choose GH  ~*good luck*~|`|kgTPnjhkaa	I generally agree with your overall assessment of RB2 vs. GH:WT. i have both and Rock Band 2 is the favorite in most aspects. I know the instruments are a biggie for most players but vocals are my thing (not that I can sing great but it’s the part I can actually follow it. You didn’t really address vocals much so here’s my two cent comparison.<br>  <br>  The scoring/rating on vocals on RB2 are generally more forgiving and the vocal highway is visually easier to follow. GH:WT gives you more difficulty levels but beginner is too easy while the other levels do seem a bit stricter than the same named level on RB2 — much like the instrument tracks are more difficult. <br>  <br>  However, the stats available on GH:WT (for vocals and instruments) are fantastic. Love the phrase/section breakdowns under “more stats.” Wish I had those stats on the RB2 songs. For those of us who play both for fun and to try to improve our scores (i.e. singing without freaking out everyone else in the band), those stats are very helpful. The only place on RB2 where you can get more feedback beyond the percentage scores and the “Most Gutsy” or “Serious Skills” type kudos are in practice mode but that’s still skimpy feedback and it’s not available during regular play.<br>  <br>  Other vocal differences: In GH:WT you have more “clappy parts” and freestyling sections while RB2 only has a little bit of freestyling and the occasional tamborine section — or mic-thumping (which, disappointingly, doesn’t count toward your score or matter one whit in your solo or band success… bummer, us vocalists get no respect!). <br>  <br>  My personal assessment of the vocals: RB2 is best for variety of songs and just having fun belting ‘em out. GH:WT is the winner when it comes to providing the vocalist (or any player) with detailed feedback on their gameplay/performance and it sets the bar a little higher as well.|`|bBDJPL04aa	Guitar hero World Tour!!! It's got all the great classics like livin on a prayer and crazy train|`|kzja9ZJ7aa	chris, Guitar Hero is my newest game on the Wii.
pSYzKDaDaa	There are programs out there that you can buy for fairly cheap (or probably pirate off of Limewire or something, but who knows what kind of viruses you might encounter) that will load the songs off of your ipod and onto your new computer.  That way you have a back up of the ipod which comes in handy because sometimes ipods like to randomly wipe...|`|PaNtuw4Daa	yea that happened to me<br>  backup your ipod on your new computer and on the itunes ipod settings it should have 3 boxes<br>  one says automatically open itunes when this ipod is connected<br>  sync only checked songs and videos<br>  or manually manage music and videos<br>  put a check on the manually manage songs and videos<br>  that way it doesnt delete anything and you can drag and drop new music or videos into the ipod without deleting anything<br>  ands if u wanna delete sumthig just click the music playlist and ittll show all your songs and just delete whatever u want
rVzsV76aaa	Yes it will.|`|sYZ6IPWjaa	Yes, it should. The form factor of the phones are the same.
T6g8O3VNaa	i have the htc touch pro aka fuze. And i love it you can text on either the touch screen or the qwerty key board. It has quick text which predicts what you are typing and it is really easy to text on. The keyboard it a nice size. The touch screen on the fuze is a lot more responsive and the screen is alot clearer. You can do so much more with the fuze then the quickfire. Go to at&t website and read the reviews. The fuze has excellent reviews and the quickfire does not. Apparently there are alot of faults with the quickfire.|`|LQWkBUxyaa	I think that the Quickfire would be easier for faster texting, because it has a more spaced out keyboard (the letters aren't touching each other. You can't imagine how much of a difference this makes for speed!), and the touch screen seems easy to navigate quickly. If you are still undecided, though, you can probably go into an AT&T store, which usually has all of their phones working so you can try out all their features in the store.|`|brVS3Pg0aa	at and t quickfire is better
RgSCstkAaa	1. You are an optimist. The Palm Pilot dates from 1997 and has a very limited memory and low resolution display. Don't expect video viewing, sorry.<br>  2. Tired old battery<br>  3.

I have a Palm Z22 that I can put pictures on, but they are low-resolution.  I can put pictures and videos on my Palm Centro.
qWicVoU9aa	That is what happens when you upgrade the firmware on the iPhone.  If it was unlocked it will be locked again.  This will happen every time.  You have to jailbreak it first before you can unlock it again as you need to load cydia and you cannot do that without jailbreaking it first.  See the links below

Just make sure to backup.<br>  You do it.|`|LQWkBUxyaa	Search for jailbreaking an iPhone on Youtube, and they should have all the steps and risks. If you need to know more, you can search on Yahoo for it too. It would take forever to type everything that they say in the videos and in the important internet articles!

ETsUQa0kaa	1) There is no type of iPod in between the shuffle and nano. Some versions of the shuffle have a screen, it could be that.<br>  <br>  2) The iPod touch has a lot more features and it can do a lot more things including using the internet, going on iTunes from your iPod and lots more!<br>  <br>  I would suggest the iPod touch. I have it and it is definitely worth the money! You can basically do everything with it! If you are not willing to spend that much money though, I would suggest the iPod classic. I know your probably thinking "those are the two most exspensive iPods", but when it comes to money, these two iPods are both most definitely worth their price. If you are wondering about iPod prices, I listed them below.<br>  <br>  Shuffle: $49 - $69<br>  Nano: $149 - $199<br>  Classic: Around $249<br>  Touch: $229 - $399|`|G8tzxwhraa	It is called the ipod mini ithink, it only comes in black and white, but it is really old. I personally like the nano 3rd generation, the square one, it has a big screen and it playes movies. the new cromatic can shuffle when you dont want it to, so you have to lock it. Get the square nano.

AA12323486	I'd go for the 18-200 Nikkor lens.  I've heard many good things about it, and I'm saving up for one for my D90.  I've never heard anything about the Tamron lens.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	To be honest, I'm a bit confused by your lens choices. First you say you're planning on buying the AF-S VR Zoom-Nikkor 70-200mm f2.8G IF-ED lens. Then you say you'd like the AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm f3.5-5.6 IF-ED lens for "daily use". <br>  <br>  In effect, you are duplicating focal lengths after 70mm on the 18-200mm lens. Plus, the 18-200mm is a variable aperture zoom which means you lose 1 1/3 stops from f3.5 to f5.6. So if you're shooting at 18mm with the lens wide open at f3.5 and getting a shutter speed of 1/125 sec. and then zoom to 200mm your shutter speed will drop to ~ 1/42 sec. <br>  <br>  Another thing to consider with the Nikkor DX lens is that if you should ever upgrade to a full-frame (FX) sensor Nikon, the DX format will still only cover the smaller DX sensor. <br>  <br>  I offer these alternative zoom lenses for your consideration:<br>  <br>  AF-S Zoom-Nikkor 24-70mm f2.8G ED<br>  <br>  AF-S Zoom-Nikkor 17-35mm f2.8D IF-ED<br>  <br>  I would also include the new AF-S Nikkor 50mm f1.4G as part of your kit. This is an especially good choice if you want to try low-light, non-flash photography. At 2 full stops faster than an f2.8 you can use a lower ISO and reduce digital noise. If you were in a low-light situation using ISO 800 with the f1.4 and getting a shutter speed of 1/60 sec., at f2.8 you'd either have to try hand-holding at 1/15 sec. or increase your ISO to 3200 (f2.8 being 2 stops slower than f1.4 and ISO 3200 being 2 stops faster than ISO 800) to achieve a 1/60 sec. shutter speed.<br>  <br>  You may be less than thrilled with the idea of a 2 or 3 lens kit but back in the old days it was common to carry 5 to 7 lenses - back when zooms were of low quality and less desirable than today's incredibly competent zooms.<br>  <br>  I'll admit to a personal bias for fast lenses and constant aperture zooms. If it were my choice I'd choose the 17-35mm f2.8, the 50mm f1.4 and the 70-200mm f2.8.|`|032edbf3c667862d220191dfca435fdbaa	i don't have any personal experience with these lenses, so take my advice with a grain of salt...but i've heard there may be problems with the autofocus on lenses with a max aperture smaller than f/5.6 because they provide so little light to the autofocus system.  i would look into this issue before buying the tamron...or just go with the nikon.

kgTPnjhkaa	There are a few jumping events so you need to get your technique right. I know<br>  that people can really struggle with these. All of the jumping events start<br>  off with a little bit of running. You need to get to your top speed as soon<br>  as possible, before your speed is locked. Check the speed bar in the top left<br>  to help you out.<br>  <br>  Once you are up to speed and locked in, in comes the important bit. Usually,<br>  you will have to begin your jump before you cross a foul line (e.g. Long <br>  Jump) or on a certain spot (e.g. High Jump). At the right time you are told<br>  that you need to raise the Wiimote. Doing too hard or too soft will result in<br>  a bad jump.<br>  <br>  This can be very hard to judge. The best advise I can give is to get<br>  practicing! Once you have found the sweet spot, you can hit it again and <br>  again. A bit like riding a bike. But without the bike. What I will say is <br>  that you need to make your move very deliberate. Often the sensor won't pick<br>  up your movement if it is too small now for theIt's kind of hard to gather, but I think skill-types fair best here, along<br>  with speed-types. Therefore the best character to use MUST be Dr. Eggman. He<br>  has a good blend of the two.<br>  <br>  Do the running thing (yawn) to start the event. Get up to top speed before<br>  you reach the spring board. As your character steps onto the board flick the<br>  Wiimote upwards. The better you do this, the higher your character will go.<br>  Whilst you are in the air you need to perform tricks. Do this by flicking<br>  the Wiimote (flex spin), Nunchuck (stretch spin) or both together (Twist<br>  Spin).<br>  <br>  You need to create combos to attain the best scores. You need to perform these<br>  moves without pausing. As soon as you perform one trick, make sure you do<br>  another one right after it. Good combos will cause your character to emit<br>  sparks. I find the best way to perform combos is to wildly throw my arms<br>  around. This ensures there is no pause between your tricks giving you time<br>  to get more in. This is an unfortunate flaw. If you are looking for a little<br>  more skill, try a combo of your own design. A combo of Wiimote, Nunchuck,<br>  Wiimote, Nunchuck, Wiimote, Nunchuck scored me well into the 9s.<br>  <br>  After performing your medal-winning combo, you need to land. Otherwise your<br>  perfect 10 is going to be reduced into the 7s. The trick is to leave plenty <br>  of time for your landing. Stop performing tricks a short while after you<br>  begin to lose height and fall. You will get a feel for this. As you come down,<br>  make sure the Wiimote is held straight. The best landing will result in you<br>  standing straight. Press the A button. You should be for a decent score if<br>  you combo'd well. <br>  <br>  If you leave your landing too late (i.e. you did too many tricks) you are in<br>  for a harder time. As you land your character is in danger of over-balancing.<br>  You need to pump the Wiimote and Nunchuck to keep them upright. You will<br>  be penalised for this and your score will reflect it. However, it is much<br>  better than falling over. This will happen if you fail to pump the controllers<br>  after landing badly. Your score will be shameful if you fall over.<br>  <br>  Perfect 10s are attainable with the right combo and a good landing. In Single<br>  Match mode, you will only need to get close to a 9.<br>  <br>  TOO EASY?: Score a perfect 10.

XcF4L6KMaa	I have a storm, and love mine. yes the initial OS that came on it sucked and was very buggy, and had a lot of lag. But as soon as you plug the phone into the desktop software it will find the official OS update, and load it. It is quite possible that they are sending the latest batches out with the updated software, but I'm not sure about that. After I loaded the new OS, it ran great. I have since experimented with several pirated beta OS releases, and some worked great, and others really were horrible. I can see a first time blackberry owner being confused with the storm, but I had other models before it, and it wasnt a big issue. The only issue for me was getting used to typing on a flat surface, rather than a dedicated keyboard.

AEaWwjm4aa	DTV has nothing to do with the pixel ratio.  Instead DTV is a method of transmitting the Televison signal.  Using Digital signals instead of the Analog radio waves frees up air space.  Digital signals basically turn the old analog signal into a series of 1's and 0's.  This allows the information to be transmitted across a greater distance without a great loss of quality. This series of 1's and 0's also use up less space when transmitting and therefore more information can be sent.  This is why going to DTV will allow for more channels such as 4.2 and 7.3.  <br>    HDTV is High Definition television and uses the 1080i and 1080p.  The difference between the two is simple.  The "i" stands for Interlaced and the "p" stands for progressive.  When television was first being developed the cathode rays, the technology used for the first televison tubes, were not fast enough to redraw a signal before the lights started fading.  You would see a visible fade moving down the screen as the cathode tried to project a picture.  The solution to this problem was simple. cut the number of pixel lines in half and the ray would travel twice as fast. instead of going down the line of pixels line 1, then line 2, then line 3, etc. etc.  Interlacing the picture yould project the picture by drawing line 1, then line 3, then line 5...you get done faster and the tube can start line 2, then line 4, etc. before line 1 would have a significant fade.  <br>  To see how interlaced worked talk a VHS and record yourself throwing a ball.  when you playback, if you pause the video look at your fingers and they look like its moving even though the video is paused.  <br>  Today we have better technology allowing the problems of yesterday to<br>  be solved.  With tecnology such as Plasma and LCD screens, the fading doesn't happen.  This allows the pixels to be projected progressively allowing for a move film like experience.|`|AA10594501	All HDTVs are DTVs, but not all DTVs are HDTVs.<br>  <br>  The digital television standard defines a video transmission standard (ATSC), which has the video and audio content carried in compressed form (in MPEG-2, the same system used in DVDs). It also defines several levels of resolution:<br>  SD - 480i<br>  ED - 480p<br>  HD - 720p<br>  HD - 1080i<br>  <br>  TV manufacturers have added another, 1080p.

When I first got into the higher levels of debt in the game (the third and forth expansions and so on) I set myself a goal of a certain number of bells per day. I achieved this goal by fishing incessantly! as well as chopping down the native fruit trees and replacing them with foreign fruit that I got from some of my friends via wifi. It was kind of a pain to pick all the fruit every day, but it gave me something to do in between classes and to procrastinate on my homework. :) Fun game!

BYHmKxpdaa	20$ in my area covers internet. AIM included and many other things, like email sent directly to your Blackberry. The charges are the same for all Blackberry phones.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	I think T-Mobile charges $20 per month for the unlimited Blackberry data plan. Doesn't matter what model you have.<br>  <br>  It might be $15. Their web site will have that. I used to have a Pearl, but I don't use it anymore.
7vFylPygaa	I don't think so. You would have to get a global phone or when I was in Italy I got this special pre-paid calling card to call the US. It wasn't that expensive while a global phone would be unless you're moving there whereas I was on vaca for about two weeks.
BhNP2P8Xaa	The G1 works OK with Edge. Of course, if you have wi-fi available, it works just great with that. They're rolling out their 3G network deliberately, so I would imagine that the mainland will be finished before they venture into the islands, but you never know.<br>  <br>  If you have their unlimited data, you can also hook up the G1 at T-Mobile Hotspots for free.|`|tD5wqGifaa	dont do it cuz i think its a sily idea

S-video uses a sort of DIN connector. RF from satellite dishes, cable, or antenna is typically handled with F connectiors, or PAL/Belling-Lee plugs in Europe for antenna.
c2j5ibzMaa	The screen can turn off when in a call, you can adjust settings to have the Omnia do whatever you want when in a call. It does also have a light sensor just to the right of the earpiece. That is mainly for adjusting to your environment, if you are in the sun it gets brighter, or in the dark it gets darker to save power. Or you can manually adjust brightness to have it remain a constant brightness in all environments. Also, get the Omnia if comparing to the Dare. It has many more great features, but it is a little more challenging to get used to using. If you are looking for user friendly, get the Dare. If you want a phone that has it all, get the Omnia. I like my Omnia, but its not something my friends can pick up and be able to use very easily. After having the phone for a few days you will be used to it, and it will be natural to use. It is slow to text on though, if you wanting a more text friendly phone, get the HTC touch pro. I send about 5000 texts a month and the Omnia works fine for that, but if you text all the time, look at the HTC phone. Hope I was some help in your phone buying decision.

yotafojtaa	It's hard to know exactly what is wrong with your iPod as i can't see what make it is, or if there are any symbols on the screen that could indicate a problem. Does your computer pop up with a notice to show that the iPod has been recognised? if so, there are settings there to reset your iPod. If that then doesn't work, then it could well be that the screen has gone. Also, have you tried to manually reset it, by holding down the menu and centre button for 5 secs? It's worth giving that a try.<br>  <br>  Is it within the 12 month warranty? You can send it back to Apple for a replacement or repairs for free, if so.
kgTPnjhkaa	ok heres my outtake of it.....The good:<br>   Comfortable design; enables play of downloadable Virtual Console titles. <br>  <br>  The bad:<br>   Doesn't play GameCube games; needs to be tethered to the Wiimote, from which it also draws power and connectivity; offers few advantages over connecting an old GameCube controller.<br>  <br>  The bottom line:<br>   Unless you don't have a GameCube controller or any GameCube games, give this Wii peripheral a pass.

IoKjLtN9aa	You only jailbreak for a special set of apps that don't appear on the app store, instead a new icon will appear on your device, Cydia. But you don't need to jailbreak to buy / download things off the apple store. <br>  <br>  Now if you get a second generation iPod touch it's currently nearly impossible to jail break so that won't really be an option :). It's okay though, there are a lot of great free games, and other apps! (that are available through the apple store!)|`|x67HctK5aa	HAHHAHA NO! I JAILBROKE MINE READ THIS: jailbreaking is not needed at all! thats just something to do to customize everything on it. you dont need to know anything to use an ipod touch! jailbreaking is themes and sliders and its hard to explain but no you dont have to! app store you can buy apps or download some for free jailbreaking is more complictaed go to youtube and learn somethin!|`|mqJBxknFaa	u don't need to jailbreak it to use apps on the app store but I dunno about other apps|`|ETsUQa0kaa	I pretty sure you only need to jailbreak it for apps.

Something probably came loose after the last drop.  If you know someone who is technically savvy, he/she might be able to try and take it apart and see what's come loose inside and try and repair it.  It's pretty much toast already so just back up your songs just in case taking it apart doesn't work.

LQWkBUxyaa	You would have to buy a data plan, just like with any other cell phone with these features. But from what I have heard, the TV is great on this phone. It even has an antenna that you can take out! You might need more than a data plan to get TV on your phone, but you still need at least a data plan, and maybe some plan por add-on to your service to get the TV on your phone.
LRIVeB5caa	yeah i just got this phone yesterday and i really would like how to do number 1 on your questions. <br>  however, i do know how to do number 3: from the homescreen click menu>settings>sound profile>normal(or whichever one you want)>click the drop down list on the top and click message>message alert tone>choose from one of the 4 provided, or at the bottom click tones, and choose from your own saved tones.<br>  <br>  hope this helped
p11sk9qhaa	You're not going to like these answers but here it goes:<br>  <br>  1. You can't have that app. It's an Apple app and not available outside the iPhone.<br>  <br>  2. The Eternity doesn't have Speed Dial or Voice Dial capabilities. <br>  <br>  3. If you mean the sound it makes when a new text message is received, go to Menu > Settings > Sound Profile. Click the profile you wish to change. At the top you'll see a drop down menu. Select "Message" and then "Message Alert Tone". Choose one of four tones available.<br>  <br>  The Eternity does have a few limitations but overall is a great, non smart phone.
95NSIO6Daa	Well I think you should probably just get him a regular iPod.

A regular mp3 player wont even be comparable. I wouldn't necessarily go for the best one, but he could still get the 8GB first generation...<br>  <br>  yeah, they are expensive...but they are so much fun and they have so much that you can do with them. I am not saying that this is the best choice, but at least consider it...don't just say no since it is expensive (maybe wait for Christmas or a birthday or something?)|`|O4R26YHRaa	Think of the things he could see on the internet!

There are a lot that are relatively cheap.|`|e0f24ba61d68e105aee75ac065c2d674aa	Maybe just get him a  mp3 player.

qWicVoU9aa	Becuase of the uniqueness of the data plans with both of these devices you will need to call AT&T and change the IMEI on each number because the iPhone you Dad will be getting will need the iPhone data plan and that feature cannot be added in the billing system if there is not an iPhone IMEI on the account.  Same thing with your number.  You will need to get them to change theIMEI on yours as well or they will not be able to remove the iphone data plan and it needs to be removed so that the BlackBerry Data plan can be added so that your device will work properly.  There will be no additional fees for doing any of this.  You may however see prorated charges on your next bill unless you wait until your bill cycle date to make the swap.  If you both have the same cycle date that is.  If you don't then it is a moot point.  If either of you have any further questions or concerns on this swap email me, I will be happy to help|`|RgSCstkAaa	Just swap the SIM cards over.|`|LQWkBUxyaa	If you switch SIM cards, nothing will happen. You will both have the same features, contacts, and everything that you did with your old phone, only that you will have a new phone. AT&T can't tell when you swtich SIM cards, but if they do, they don't charge you for it. If the tethering is with the Bold, then you should call AT&T and tell them to cahnge that to the iPhone, but other than that, you guys should be able to swtich for nothing else. You might want to make sure that your dad doesn't have his email account set up on his Blackberry when you get it, though, otherwise you will get all of his emails on your phone when you switch.

Does the card reader have a light that comes on when the card is in?<br>  <br>  If the light is coming on (if it has one) and the card is just not showing up, try rebooting the computer and trying again.<br>  <br>  Is the card reader separate from the computer?

76cAAPfBaa	Infra-Red light beam, that basically transmits modulated control signals to a receiver built into the tv set. If you look at the end of the remote through your digital camera viewscreen, you can actually see the beam!|`|k2wiYJAcaa	magic.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	through IR signal, that's why its basically line of sight although you can bounce it off a mirror. Its a form of light that falls outside our visible spectrum.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	It doesn't "communicate" as such. It is a one -way transmission.<br>  <br>  It is usually done with IR, and the hand unit has an IR LED.<br>  <br>  To transmit, the remote finds what button has been pressed by sensing X and Y matrix lines. A key press will link an X line to a Y line. It also senses unit strapping, to identify that particular remote from others.<br>  <br>  When it figures out the address and matrix code (a byte of data with the closed X and Y lines encoded into  it). it serially sens them to the carrier generator.  It sends an attention signal ( a long carrier pulse  with a rest of no pulse), then sequentially each bit in the address  then the matrix code, with check bits thrown it to make sure the signal is valid. A data bit 1 is sent as a short pulse of carrier, and a data bit zero sent as a long carrier pulse. <br>  The carrier itself is a 40 Khz or so waveform, gated by the data generated above.<br>  <br>  In the TV, it has an IR receiver, which receives the IR signal, amplifies it a bit, and detects the data pulse train coming from it. That goes into he TV's computer. Amongst its other taskts, it looks for an attention signal from the remote sensor. If it finds one, it listens for a  bit stream meeting the timing and bit length characteristics of the protocol used. If that is valid, then it examines the data for validity, and if that passes,then to see if it is a code for it. It then sends the matrix code to the another part of the software that figures what key it is and what to do when that key is received.
trxSLyqgaa	I have the same problem just baught a cheap net 10 phon or the sim and now I can not seem to use i because net 10 and trac phone lock up the sim cards so even if you buy a unlocked phone and you put in the sim cardit will not work right or maby not at aall just like you can unloc trac phone and net 10 but then you would still have to keep there minutes on it to use iut on the other carrier they love to screww you one way or another hope this helps and sorry to have to tell ya I ould recommend you buy the nicer phone ad then get a prepaid at&t cell and you could use that sim in a unolcked phone|`|VPzjuI8Iaa	If you have a phone in mind,<br>  Search on the internet to make sure it is unlockable, then buy it.<br>  Then buy instructions on how to unlock it.<br>  The phone you have right now must have a SIM card.
LQWkBUxyaa	I think that it is a pretty good phone, but you can read great cell phone reviews on this website: cnet.com<br>  <br>  Just search for LG Vu, and click on it on the list that comes up. They have a full review of all the features on the page, and you can also click on the user ratings, which should be right next to the Cnet rating (which should be near the top). Happy phone shopping!|`|AkAoMwmqaa	I would recommend the LG Versa, which is also on Verizon.<br>  <br>  It works about the same as the vu but has things you can attach to it, such as qwerty keyboard.<br>  <br>  Comes out in a couple of days i think.<br>  Check it out.<br>  Most people don't know about it yet but I think you would like it if you like the vu|`|tiguZHIQaa	My recomindation would be to check it out on Cnet.|`|Qjba1tiQaa	I don't like it very much. it's fragile|`|o58qWNiwaa	I don't know if it's good or not but I think it's a ripoff of the Iphone

qWicVoU9aa	No, the AT&T stores do not loan out phones. neither would they swap it out even if they still have them.  The only time you can swap a phone out in a store is if it is still within the first 30 days of purchase.  The only recourse you might have is if you had insurance on it.  If so you can call them.  The number for the AT&T insurance provider is 888-562-8662.  As far as you not wanting to pay for something you cannot use that is not AT&T's problem.  They did not break the device, you did.  You could always pick up a cheap GoPhone and put your SIM card in it until you are eligible for upgrade.  If your contract is up in July then you should be eligible for an early upgrade in April.  If you call Customer Service at 1-800-331-0500 and talk real nice to them you might get one that is willing to help you get a new device.
76cAAPfBaa	Sometimes Dish sucks out a lot of bandwidth, to spread it around to other channels. That can cause this. Or, if this is coming from one of your local channels that are on a spot-beam, they can be weaker signals, and cause it when a heavy cloud goes over.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it comes straight from the actual broadcast, from the station itself.. There can be lots of reasons..

You've followed the set up directions, scanned for channels and now all you get is a black screen that says "no signal".  If you're not getting the 'no signal' message, then either you haven't done the set up correctly or the box is defective.<br>  <br>  If you are getting the no signal, then you need to either adjust your antenna or get a new one.  even though 'they' say your old antenna will work, it doesn't seem to be the case more often than not.  And a lot of stations when to UHF in the conversion.<br>  <br>  I like www.tvfool.com for finding out what stations you'll get and how far away you are from them, the direction they are and what interferences might be in the way.  These are all things to consider when shopping for a new antenna.<br>  <br>  I was so frustrated that I spent the time to research antennas and find the best ones (short, medium and long range) at the most reasonable price.  I made a blog a bout them...|`|8IHfytEvaa	I have a Magnavox Converter box, its hooked up to rabbit ears and it works ok.

IoKjLtN9aa	Well, the only difference is one has Microphone support (You'll still have to buy a microphone) and external speakers. big whoop. <br>  <br>  But there's something most people do not know, the second generation is nearly impossible to jail break. Meaning you can't have custom themes, cracked apps, jail broken apps. If you don't care about jail breaking or external speakers, I say still get the first generation it will be cheaper and just in case if you ever want to jail break many moons later you can :).|`|PaNtuw4Daa	2nd gen has a speaker and side buttons and it has a bit of a better ipod<br>  but it feels cheaper and weaker<br>  i have a 1st gen and i love it<br>  but 2nd gen is slimmer<br>  but id choose the 1st gen<br>  :]<br>  the silver plastic around 2nd gen feels cheap and it gives me the feeling ittll break anytime soon|`|Io3jW3EEaa	get the 2nd its better|`|k0BF9M0Haa	Ok so there is a BIG difference.<br>  <br>  As all these people said, the second gen. is much more ligher, smaller, comes with extra side buttons, and has SPEAKERS :O<br>  <br>  but at the same time, the first gen. iPod has more of classic look the only advantage to this is that you can get it jailbroken... and it's cheaper.<br>  <br>  It's probably not wise to suggest jailbreaking it, but it does include tons more things you can't have with the second gen. (well, at least not yet)<br>  <br>  oh and one more thing...<br>  when you get the first gen. you'll have to upgrade it to a 2.x filmware which (i believe) costs 10 extra dollars... with the second gen. it should already have to correct filmware...<br>  <br>  so just think about it.. :]<br>  Hope this helps!|`|a8hbGnlOaa	the 2nd gen is better it has a speaker and it is slightly smaller and lighter|`|6HgiNCmqaa	2nd is better..1st is cheaper|`|GmEdWFPEaa	Can you help me out here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/aut5v3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/aut5v3</a><br>  <br>  You would be helping yourself out as well b/c it is reallly fun and addicting.

CQA4HAdmaa	You need to transfer the files on your iPod to your computer.  Once you update your songs, you them click on the box for album art in iTunes. So go to Kayne West and click on the album art.  If you get your music from say Rhapsody, then you may have to get that album art from there.  For whatever reason, it appears if you have album art from something other than iTunes, you may get problems. Apple has also had some problems in this regard.|`|kJFXxMeRaa	click advanced and get album artowrk and if that doesnt work ask my source

Animal Crossing: City Folk<br>  2. Mario Kart<br>  3. Guitar Hero III / Aerosmith / World Tour (all can be played via wifi)<br>  4. Super Smash Brothers Brawl<br>  <br>  I am sure there are more, those are the only ones I have experience with playing via WiFi.  <br>  <br>  All, except for Animal Crossing, you need to get your Wii's code, and you will need your friends.  I am sure it is in the Wii Settings somewhere, other people have posted "how to"s.  Animal Crossing you get your friend code at the gate in your town (in-game).  It seems like many of the "questions" in this section (yahoo>wii) are about friend codes in Animal Crossing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|3pLv7KBvaa	if you mean like 360 and ps3 no you cant wii wifi or the moden cable only works with other wiis.<br>  <br>  the same goes for the 360 and ps3. you can only play with the same console.<br>  <br>   to get someone friends to play the have to add your friends code. which if you go to the wii meanu you hit the letter and create a message.  thats your friends code.|`|SLBYhPplaa	Yes, you can you need a wireless router then make an internet connection from that to your Wii and connect it to your computer or DSL box.|`|y8HKAhBFaa	yes u can...
