20090223092834AAQbJyh	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Hitachi 50v500 rear projection hd 720p big screen tv has a red spot in it. Anyone know what this is?	Hey, I bought a hitachi 50v500 projection tv with special lamps. The tv works fine but there is a huge red spot that takes up about 30% of the screen. I have consulted ebay professionals and have gotten mixed answers, so I do not really know whats wrong with my tv. This was the flagship model about 4 or 5 years ago and it is high def 720p. I did purchase this tv about 4 years ago and i have never changed the lamp or bulb, so it does appear like the picture has faded over time. I have a westinghouse that was quite a bit cheaper and newer and it is simply amazing, its a 32 inch and is so clear it can almost be high def in itself without it being actually in high def. I hope I didnt spend$3000 for nothing, cuz right now my $700 tv looks better than the $3,000 one.

20090223075908AAZHCM2	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Is Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition too easy?	Hey guys. I am wanting to play through res4 again before 5 comes out b/c it is such a good game and I probably won't be going back for a while once 5 is here.      As such, I have been trying to decide whether or not I'd like to play the gamecube version, or the wii version.      The wii version sounds like the best of both worlds; it has the additional content, 16x9 support, and "improved controls", or so I hear.      However, my friend (who owns the wii version), said that he still prefers the gamecube version because the wii controls make it too easy in his opinion. I don't know how much truth there is to this statement, so I guess I'm just looking for some more opinions on the matter; the more the better.      So, is the wii edition of res4 "too easy", or much easier than its gamecube counter-part? I don't mind trying out the new controls, because they sound awesome, but I don't want to just blow through the game with god-like accuracy and not be challenging as much as I remember being challenged back on the gamecube. Do you think I should play the gamecube version, or the wii version, considering the controls and the level of difficulty?

20090223105223AA5y7sV	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Why can't my Ps3 install Street Fighter 4?	I recently bought Street Fighter 4 for Ps3. After beating the game and unlocking all the characters I found out about the install feature and how it speeds loading times. I started to install the game and the installation just froze at 41 percent. i waited about an hour to see if it would finish but it wouldn't so i just stopped the installation. When trying to play the game afterwords the ps3 said that an error occured while loading. When i finally did get my Street fighter game to work it would freeze at loading screens especially after matches. whats wrong with my ps3?

20090223110050AAnWBMd	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Changing exposure time?	Hey, I'm about to go out and take some night shots with a new digital camera I got a few days ago (Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX37). I'd like to experiment with the exposure times, but I can't find the way to change them... I've scanned the manual and have found nothing.       There is a 'night scenery' mode, but that would take the fun away, don't you think? Besides, it is always good to know how to manually change settings to try new things.       If anyone could help me I would be very thankful.
