But you don't have to use that software , any Audio recording software which lets you select the Audio mixer channel can be used even free ones.<br>  Now for direct play back control it is more complicated than that , you will probably have to use the provided propriety software that comes with the USB turntable. The software must send special control commands to it. The only other way is for the manufacturer to make the turntable identify itself to the PC as a CD or DVD player , in which case any CD or DVD playback software can control it. But you will have to ask the manufacturer about that.

pZGLhV2Waa	I have both and they are both great lenses. For the money you can't beat the 17-40. The 24-70 is also a great lens. <br>  <br>  These lenses really are for different purposes though. The 17-40 is great for moderate wide angle to normal. Some good uses are landscapes, street photography, or just an all around lens. It is not however good for portraits as it is to short. You do have another option. The EFs 17-55 F2.8 $1,000. This will replace what you have with a much faster lens. This is a great lens but if you ever plan on going with a full frame camera you wont be able to use it.<br>  <br>  The 24-70 is great for portraits and also for an all around lens. This is the most common lens used by wedding photographers. Its focal length is ideal for most wedding situations. It is also good for low light close up action shots. For example photographing a pit crew at a race track. Assuming you are right there with them.<br>  <br>  If the wide angle is really what you are after but want a faster lens the 16-35mm F2.8L is a great lens as well. It is about $1,300.<br>  <br>  What I would consider a perfect set up for your camera would be the following.<br>  <br>  EFs 10-22mm. You need it for real wide angle shots. It is designed exclusively to get the same field of view you would get with a 16-35 or 17-40 on a full frame camera. <br>  <br>  EF 17-40 F4L or 16-35 F2.8L<br>  EF 24-70 F2.8<br>  EF 70-200 F2.8L IS or the cheaper but equally as good 70-200 F4L IS<br>  EF 100mm F2.8 macro<br>  <br>  You can also throw in a few fast prime lenses like a 50mm F1.4 or 85mm F1.8 and 135mm F2L.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	If you're looking for a good all around lens, I would probably go for the 24-70 f/2.8.  Better range.<br>  <br>  Another lens to consider is the 24-105 f/4 L IS.  A lot of people use that for their all purpose lens and I've heard amazing things about it.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have the 70-200 f/2.8 L IS and the 24-70 f/2.8 L compliments it extremely well... Even down to the 77 mm filter size.<br>  <br>  The 17-40 is a great lens from everything I've read and heard, but it's so reasonably priced, it won't break you if you pick it up after you have your all purpose lens needs met.  I actually plan to pick one up after the 24-70 :)|`|ZssP10Efaa	24-70mm! You will get much more use out of the wider aperture than the shorter range. ....perhaps a 17-70mm f2.8-4.5 would be the best of both worlds|`|55orqX2yaa	17-40 mm is an average lens, but I would not recommend it if you need to take any type of low light situation.  I have the 24-70 mm, and I love it for indoor of all sorts... I have even been able to use it in an auditorium, and still get great pictures, with using little to no flash.  It is also nice if you are taking outdoor pictures of single subject, and you want to blur the background.  One of the obvious cons of the lens over the other one is that it can not get as  wide angle as the other, but , in my opinion, the 2.8 way pays for itself, in both light, and bang for your buck.  I think that overall, you would be happier with the 2.8, by what you described. But, over all, of my four lenses, my 24-70, 2.8f is my favorite for just about everything.|`|uLZrKiW8aa	Bang for your bucks would be the 24-70 mm f 2.8 L. Will be more or less walk-around lens for you. <br>  <br>  The 17-40 mm f 4 L would work on your camera like a "kit" lens, yet, much sharper with higher contrast and better made than the original kit lens. Both lenses have butterly smooth focusing / zoom rings and both have "full time manual" focus, which lets you touch up focusing at any time. <br>  <br>  I have had both (on 5D). Gave the 17-40 mm away and replaced it with 16-35 mm f 2.8. <br>  <br>  Some photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/little_pooky" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/little_pooky</a>

3kboRgkzaa	There are defiantly glitches in that game that cheaters abuse! For example, I've seen many people use glitches in the Monastery map to hide behind walls. You can't go through these walls because you don't know how. The cheaters who do this have looked up the glitches and know where to exactly stand and what weapons to use to get into these glitches. I don't know how to get into the walls but one could  easily find out by searching the internet. My advise: keep playing fair because honestly, the cheaters who hide in the walls don't deserve any kills they get for abusing glitches in the game!

One on the inside of the DS (Facing you when you look at the screen) and one on the outside (So you can watch the screen and take pictures of other things) <br>  <br>  You can use different features to change these pictures to make them look funny and/or goofy and add stuff to it. <br>  <br>  There is also a music editor built in that you can record your voice and play with it - Changing pitch and speed and adding sound effects. <br>  <br>  The DSi is a bit thinner than the DS Lite, it has slightly bigger screens and it also has a slot to put an SD card in it (Like a camera) <br>  <br>  The DSi Also plays Mp3s off your SD Card which is kind of neat..<br>  <br>  Also a new feature is you can connect to a nintendo Store and purchase items such as games and I'm sure other things..<br>  <br>  As far as getting a PSP or DSi... DSi is going to be for more "on the go" gaming.. Games that you can easily pop in and play for 10-15 minutes at a time.

RTHWQvkzaa	When you hear the beat but no lyrics, usually the headphones are not completely plugged into the MP3 player. If they are definately in all the way, they might be broken :(<br>  <br>  Mine have broke quite a few times as well. They might break a lot if you stuff them into small areas or don't pay attention to how you store them. I used to always grab them and bunch up the headphones and try to stuff my MP3 into a pouch in my backpack. At the end of the day they would be tangled. Leaving them tied in bad knots might eventually start to break them. You should take the time to wrap the headphones around and around the MP3 player- it is a good way to store the MP3 player without having knots later :)<br>  <br>  A suggestion would be to get an MP3 player case i know they have ipod cases, they must have ones for regular MP3 players. Any small pouch or case will do.<br>  <br>  Also, if you start having problems wher eonly one side works, and then they both work, and then only one side again, this is a sign they are breaking. Just so you don't feel bad, i will tell you that mine are broken too1 I have been listening with only one working side for about a month now:) I really need to get new ones. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|HGnWKRzyaa	There is probably something wrong with the headphone plug in.

If the touch has the wrong password it will connect to the router, but not get any internet connection.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	Maybe you need a password for where you are, that would show you can get on (explains the bars) but would tell you that you are not actually conected.|`|sX7N7xnfaa	try to reconnect it plug it into ur comp with the usb and use internet there on the ipod then plug it out make sure the wifi works if not try restoring ur ipod or find a new network|`|kMj69JEjaa	This has happened to me a couple of times especially when i go out to places that have public wifi. make sure that your ipod understands the ip address. i think it has do do with the connection of the modem, no your ipod. sometimes the connection bar will suddenly go down and you will loose connection. i think you should look into your router(modem) and check your settings, as well as connection. i would prefer that you buy or use linksys because it is very fast and durable for distance and connectivity.i hope this works. if there are any other questions i would be glad to help answer them as best i can.|`|JuuBZoMxaa	try to set up a different network<br>  cuz maybe the one you have right now is crap.<br>  if that doesnt work, then all i have to say is <br>  APPLE PRODUCTS SUCK<br>  good luck(:|`|WcOmKwXNaa	I don't know<br>  Good Luck|`|3xoEFFOKaa	well good luck with that<br>  literally u'll need it! lol|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Are you using WAP or WEP encryption on your wireless router?

4UkEhKeqaa	It really depends on if you play by yourself or with other people..<br>  <br>  Game Cubes are definitely affordable you can pick one up easily under $30 on ebay.  Ps2 has more games and most definitely better games for solo playing. But Game Cube has some great gems out there if you are looking for something different..<br>  <br>  If you've never played a recent Zelda or Super Smash Brothers I'd go for a Game Cube and Grab one of those games.. Zelda Windwaker is a bit childish (yet lots of fun) where as Zelda Twilight Princess is more adult and darker. Both are fun. <br>  <br>  And Smash Brothers Melee is one of the best Multiplayer games out there for anyone to pickup and play. <br>  <br>  To be honest where you have a ps2.. I'd say go for a Game Cube.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	u must be pretty weird but i would get more games for the ps2 but if ur tired of the ps2 i would try getting a gc because they are pretty cool

(imagine rewinding 100 or 200 tapes at 2 min each) The rewind stickers were just put on to encourage the public to be courteous and help them out a little.<br>  I always fessed up when returning an an unwound tape, but I usually rewound them before I headed out my door.

If you're just beginning photgraphy, then this will do. <br>  I'm also wondering...why does your question say pros and cons but the detailed one have nothing to do with it? <br>  <br>  Well, i'll answer both questions anyway :P.<br>  <br>  The nikon D40 is a great beginner DSLR, which takes great pictures, costs so little, and is just the best thing for a beginner.<br>  <br>  Pros : In the camera, there is an "INFO" display, which tells you what each setting will do.<br>  -Big and Bright LCD<br>  - Quick autofocus.<br>  <br>  CONS: - Doesn't have as many "extra" features as some other entry-level DSLRS<br>  - Works only with AF-S and AF-I lenses.<br>  <br>  ACCESORIES.<br>  Some recommended things to buy would include..<br>  -A bag to carry this baby 'round<br>  -(You need this...) A Memory Card, around 2-8 GB<br>  -Possibly another lens (any kind you like)<br>  <br>  I have another recommendation for you. Get the D40. This author (Kenrockwell.com) explains why.

qWicVoU9aa	Probably, but it would be quite expensive.  Motorola does not have any free (at least none that I have been able to find) software for that.  They do however sell Motorola Phone Tools software that will do what you want.  I am not sure what it costs now.  That software will get them off the RAZR but I don't know if it would allow you to put them on the new device as you did not specify what it is.  You would more than likely have to get software for the new device as well so that the computer recognizes the device when you connect it with the USB and then transfer the info to the device.  Does the Boost device take a SIM card?  If so then Boost may have what is called a card reader that they could take your old SIM and copy them and transfer them to your new SIM.
8F5t3DhKaa	Well, even if they were a complete jerk, maybe you should take it. Maybe its like, a peace offering or something. Or maybe they are trying to make themselves feel better about being a jerk to you, and want to make it up to you by giving you a gift.<br>  <br>  Although, I don't know you or the person, or what they did to you to be a jerk, so in some other case, you could decline the gift. You could be like: "thnx for the offering but I really can't/don't need to use this right now." Just try to be polite about it.<br>  <br>  My own opinion: I think you should give the person a second chance.<br>  P.S. If you end up taking it but you don't want it, I'll take it!!!!! lol :)|`|IoKjLtN9aa	You could either tell the person you don't want it or you could exchange your gift card for one you like at <a href="http://www.cardavenue.com/!" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardavenue.com/!</a> <br>  <br>  But other than that you can't just "deny" the gift over the computer.

qWicVoU9aa	All SIM unlock codes are tied to the particular device IMEI and are carrier specific.

RyvKws7Laa	LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also physically lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well (though good Plasmas are now beating LCDs). It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a modern Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.<br>  <br>  It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies). The new 240Hz ones with LED backlighting are making good strides, but right now you're paying a HUGE premium for those features.<br>  <br>  LCD life spans are fairly equal to Plasma ones now (the better Plasmas that is).  You're looking in the 60,000-100,000 range.  So at 8 hours a day 365 days a year, that's 20-30 years.  So either way you're likely fine.<br>  <br>  Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you often do have to pay a bit of premium for them. Images look smoother. They have greater ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).<br>  <br>  Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds). Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news). This isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference. Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.<br>  <br>  They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100-200 hours, then optimize, and you'll have an amazing TV experience.<br>  <br>  Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine. Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).<br>  <br>  Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 8 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 25-30 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?<br>  <br>  Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses. This is again no longer an issue. Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).<br>  <br>  Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.<br>  <br>  Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung. The Panasonic TH-50PZ800 or Samsung PN50A650 would both be top notch choices.<br>  <br>  LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets. Samsung is a step above the rest if you go with the 5, 6, 7, or 9 series models.|`|fwdsp3dVaa	Plasmas last about 100,000 hrs before losing half their contrast. That's about 30yrs of use @ 8hrs/day! Some LCD's have CCFL bulbs that do eventually burn out and need to be replaced but they don't burn out fast...about 5-10yrs or so depending on usage.<br>  <br>  Plasma TV's are best for fast motion content like sports & movies because of their high contrast ratios(2,000,000:1 dynamic--40,000:1 native) and their super fast refresh rates(600hz)!<br>  <br>  LCD's are best for well lit rooms and for mounting on walls.<br>  <br>  See this website for more info on both types...<a href="http://www.plasma-lcd-facts.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasma-lcd-facts.co.uk/</a>|`|f214429e4e17c6a8c91dfc66ee5378d7aa	I own a 47" Phillips LCD and it's beautiful whenever you're watching a blu-ray. If you're planning on buying a new HDTV go for an LCD. Pioneer recently ended it's production of their Kuro line which was one of the best if not the best Plasma's out there.

heFbG2FRaa	I personally prefer Canon, but I am shooting with higher-end gear and don't have any first hand knowledge of the consumer level cameras. <br>  <br>  Bear this in mind though - Canon lenses are *typically* more expensive, but the optics are arguably better than Nikon. Canon spends a lot of money of research and development of their lenses and this shows in the quality (and, unfortunately, the price!)|`|YaSF9P5taa	To put this short and simple, you want a camera that is ergonomic and you find comfortable in your hands. Just go to a local electronic store and ask to hold the cameras. You don't necessarily have to buy it from that store.<br>  <br>  Both those cameras are good cameras, althought from comparing specs, i would stick with the Rebel EOS XS. (might want to check out the XSi too.) But I enjoy the ergonomics of Nikon DSLRs to suit me better. (you should also check out the D40 and D80. The D40 is pretty much the exact same as the D60 minus a few additional features that most can live without. With the saved money you can buy a better lens)|`|OIdXanGXaa	I have the Nikon D40 and I absolutely love it! I am just starting out in photography and this camera is great.  It is pretty compact for a DSLR and takes amazing pictures.  It is easy to understand the different functions and has an auto setting that does really good.  I have a few (amateur) photographer friends and they all use Nikon cameras.|`|p2fYB13uaa	but what about canon sd1200? i like this one very very much|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	Just make double sure your teacher wants the class to use a digital SLR and not a 35mm SLR.|`|WPVpOfuwaa	The Nikon D60 is my favorite camera.

VOSyb1fcaa	There are three ways to get Wi-Fi on your Wii. You can do it through a router (recommended), you can get a Wi-Fi USB<br>  (it's been discontinued, but can still be found) and put it in your computer's router, or you can use a LAN adapter. <br>  <br>  Look here for more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineRequirements.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  Next, follow this link to a set-up guide, or read my instructions below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/connectingOnline.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  1.

ztPBKgILaa	<a href="http://www.ventones.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ventones.com</a> <br> <br>  just follow the steps on that site . Ventones shows how to get free ringtones for iphones. <br> <br>  i use it for my iphone 3g all the time|`|Rs1Mc34paa	The iPhone is different when it comes to ringtones. While with most phones you can just create a small mp3 file and then put it on your phone to set as a ringtone, that is not the case with the iPhone. However, it can be done after you follow a few steps.<br>  <br>  1) You will need to enable the viewing of file extensions by unhiding them on your computer. If you are unsure about how to do this, you can just google it and make sure you input what OS you have for your computer.<br>  <br>  2) You will need to open iTunes and open the preferences menu. You will need to change your "Import CD" settings so that instead of converting your audio files into MP3 files, you will have to change it to create AAC files.<br>  <br>  3) Take the file that you want to be your ringtone and right-click it. Then, choose to Convert Into AAC Version, Make sure that you are able to locate where this file was created.<br>  <br>  4) Delete the song added onto the iTunes database but DO NOT remove the file completely. Make sure it stays somewhere on your hard drive. You technically don't have to do this but the song will become useless after Step 5.<br>  <br>  5) Go to wherever the file you just converted was created and look at its extension. The extension of the file should be .m4a, at this point you will have to change the file extension (by changing the file name) to .m4r instead of .m4a.<br>  <br>  6) Take the .m4r file and drag it onto your iTunes window, iTunes will recognize the file as a ringtone and place it into the "Ringtones" catergory.<br>  <br>  7) Connect your iPhone and then go to the Ringtone tab of the iPhone menu. You will have to check the box that allows iTunes to sync ringtones.<br>  <br>  8) You will receive a message saying that all media on your iPhone will be deleted by choosing to sync ringtones. Do not be alarmed, if you want custom ringtones then just enable it. However, you will have to re-sync all the music and videos you had on the iPhone afterward.<br>  <br>  That's all there is to it! It's much better to do it this way than doing it the official Apple way where you actually pay for your ringtones in the iTunes Store. Each ringtone you get this way will cost a little over $2 ($1.29 for the song you want and then another $0.99 if you want to create a ringtone from it).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

The graphics are bad and the controls are too difficult. So please get The Show|`|QIlhmWwBaa	actually mlb 2k9 is pretty good<br>  you should download it from the xbox live marketplace and give it a try <br>  the last 2k8 was crap but this one looks good<br>  i have played both demos the show on the ps3 and 2k9 on the 360 and both look pretty much the same to me and i still don't know which one to get either|`|q1Hb70nTaa	you should get 2k9. You will find a lot more people to play online because it is the only baseball game for xbox. the graphics will be outstanding so you shouldn't sacrifice those. <br>  personally, if i were you i would trade in my 360 and ps2 for a ps3. I did that about a month ago and I think it is so much better. than you can get mlb 09 the show for ps3 and get the best game out!!|`|pl2SocVKaa	well if you thought mlb 2k8 sucked  2k9 will probably suck so just try out 09 the show and make the sacrifice|`|xwEPYEqSaa	The Show for PS2 is better than 2K for 360 by far.|`|m9VOPLSsaa	I am struggling with the same dilemma.  I think I will rent both, and go from there.

oZTMyTQOaa	Like others have said, Blu-Ray.com is a pretty good site to get some reviews and new releases.  I have found that many retailers, like walmart and target list their movies online.  Amazon.com has a full dedicated store for Blu-ray movies and players, with good discounts and lots of user reviews.  <br>  <br>  And don't forget Ebay.com.  While you will find some non-discounted dealers there, you can also pick up some good bargains if you don't mind buying used.  I'd probably go more fore used movies than players, due to the bulkiness of transport.<br>  <br>  Probably the best single source of information would be one that included multiple sources so you could do comparisons on one site.  So far, I've only found one:  <a href="http://superblurayvalues.com/." rel="nofollow">http://superblurayvalues.com/.</a>  They have ebay and amazon listings, as well as feeding off the RSS for blu-ray.com's new releases and reviews.  I found it handy while looking up some new releases as well as being able to see prices from different sources.<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind: they appear to keep their listings separate but still on the same site.  To get amazon prices, click the movies or player store at the top.  To see ebay listings, you'll find those in the movies and player categories, where the ebay listings are presented like a blog entry.|`|UinOWcMUaa	<a href="http://www.blu-ray.com/players/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blu-ray.com/players/</a>|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Blu-ray.com is a great source for Blu-ray information.  It has prices, reviews, prices, release dates, forums, etc.  They connect to Amazon, which is in my experience the best place to buy Blu-ray movies.  However, it appears to be maintained by the Blu-ray industry, so treat it only as a source of objective information (i.e. prices).

As for storing them, it really doesnt matter. Most phones now you can easily transfer them from your phone to sim card and visa-versa.|`|SAKHbxrKaa	when you save the contacts in SIM, you save it on the chip where when you transfers your chip to another mobile you will fine your contacts,<br>  and when you save to mobile, you only save it on the mobile, you cant find it on other mobile if you transfered the chip( the service provider) example: vodaphone. <br>  that what all you need to know hope that help, this is best answer!

That's what the store was claiming so that their 90% off sale price of $15 looked good.<br>  <br>  Also, my 52" Sony television cost me $2500 brand new at Best Buy. The exact same model at Circuit City was 40% clearance for $4500. I paid the MSRP for the TV at Best Buy.

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	HDMI connected from PS3 to receiver will give you HD sound such as DTS-HD MA or Dolby True HD from Blu-ray movies, optical cable is not compatible with HD audio formats. Just use optical for cable box only.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	First of all, "HDMI audio" means nothing.  HDMI is a cable.<br>  <br>  The first way you mention is the best way to go.  The reason for this is because if you run the HDMIs to the receiver and then the HDMI out to the TV you need to switch input sources on the receiver, not the TV.  If you run the HDMIs directly to the TV and then send audio via optical from the PS3 and cable to the TV (and, presumably, out to your receiver) you will not get surround sound.  This is because the TV can't pass surround sound signals.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, optical cables can't pass multi-channel PCM, which is what HD audio soundtracks are decoded into by the PS3.  So your best bet here is to go with HDMI from PS3>receiver, HDMI from cable>receiver and HDMI from receiver>TV.<br>  <br>  Then set up the remote to work with the Onkyo receiver and do all of your switching through that.  I have verified that the receiver (HT-R667) is in the Harmony 550 database.|`|FgTkF31iaa	If you use HDMI  to the TV you will have to turn down the sound or mute it on the TV when  you use the receiver the optical is a digital signal and every bit as good as an HDMI hook up  But you should be able to use the receiver and run both HDMI cables to the receiver and a single HDMI to the TV using the receiver to do the switching just change the source and the audio and the video will change. The remote shouldn t have any impact on the hook up as long as it controls the receiver correctly if you have a problem getting the video thru the receiver check the system programing.

josOoA32aa	The 1920x1080 resolution. Also, the Blu-Ray disc formats use actual blue lasers as opposed to red lasers. Therefore, the discs can hold up to 50GB (yes, GB) and using all that space, Blu-Ray discs are recorded in true high definition (DTS HD-Master Audio and 1920x1080 resolution; it will take up to 35MBPS to play at this resolution and rate and that's why the discs can hold so much).<br>  <br>  They are expensive because Blu-Rays are becoming the new format. Remember back when VHS was still popular but the first DVD players were being introduced? They too were priced expensive like new Blu-Ray players are. Eventually when they develop newer technology than Blu-Ray, those new players will too be highly priced. It's because it's a new technology, I guess.|`|vdJkPXAsaa	Pricing of any device when it comes in the market will be high as there are no competitors.

FD8I4zthaa	Use a flash or lights.<br>  <br>  Cameras need LIGHT!|`|pC2jGRKraa	Right, auto is designed so you can shoot decently in average conditions. It will result in good daytime photos of generic stuff, but when you need something more specialised you need to used the "creative zone" on your function wheel.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to set the camera to the M setting (manual) and open your aperture to maximum, and your shutter speed as low as possible and the ISO speed as high as possible while keeping the built in light meter to take the photo at between -1 and 0. Since it's wildlife photography you won't really be able to practically use a flash of any description.<br>  <br>  If you still are getting an blurry or underexposed picture you will want to get a faster lens (lower F number, suggest a Tamron 70-300 f2.8)<br>  <br>  Edit - after getting faster glass, if that is still not enough you will probably want to sit nice and far away with a tripod. If you still aren't getting the results you want, you the last thing you can to is go up to a full frame camera, something like a 5D or a 1D.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Yeah, there's definitely a lack of light. Your camera can take images as long as there's *some* light, but you need to set it up right:<br>  <br>  1) Take it out of auto mode and put it in Av mode. This will allow you to control the aperture.<br>  <br>  2) Open the aperture as wide as possible by turning the control dial until the number on the LCD is as small as possible. A smaller number means larger aperture hole which means more light.<br>  <br>  3) If the shutter speed is still too low, turn up the ISO. Higher ISOs make the camera more sensitive to light but also increase the noise in the photo. However, photo with noise is better than no photo at all.<br>  <br>  4) If the shutter is still too slow, zoom out and reduce the aperture again. Cheaper lenses have a larger aperture at the wide end so you can get more light by zooming out.<br>  <br>  5) If you've done all of the above and are still not getting good photos you either need to a) Get more light. This can be from a flash, taking the photos earlier in the day or maybe from a lamp. Or, b) Buy a new lens with a wider maximum aperture. Look for an f-number next to the focal length of the lens. Something with f/2.8 or lower would be good.|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	First of all, Auto settings are something every camera owner should learn to avoid ASAP. They only work under ideal conditions.<br>  <br>  Like others have said, he needs light. Yes, you can take photos by moonlight or street lamps, but that requires know-how and the right settings, a tripod, and an external shutter release. You can only take photos that way of things that don't move, since the shutter will be open for a very long time.<br>  <br>  There is no way you'll get wildlife to hold still in the dark so you can have a five second exposure. <br>  There is a good reason for the amazing variety of flash lights, studio lights, reflectors etc...... even a nice camera can't perform miracles.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	hipp5 gave a good answer. The problem is not the camera, its the lens. Unfortunately to get any better results mean an expensive wide aperture telephoto lens, and even these have limitations, but they will extend a usable shutter speed into lower light situations.<br>  <br>  Not total darkness for that the shutter speed would have to be measured in minutes not fractions of a second. Amazingly digital cameras can still record a full colour image when you can't see anything with very long exposures.<br>  <br>  What your camera is doing when it says busy is its recording a 'dark frame', over a certain low shutter speed (varies from camera to camera, but is usually around 1/4 of a second or longer), the camera will automatically record a 'dark frame' of the same shutter duration which will have all the noise generated by the sensor, this 'dark frame' is then subtracted from the image frame which reduces noise dramatically. This can be turned off in menu.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|i5OVORXgaa	Photography literally means "drawing with light."<br>  <br>  You can't create a photograph without light! To get good pictures of wildlife he'll have to go out before the sun sets.|`|WYdb31Llaa	450d isn't made to take low light pictures. You have to use one of the pro model(d700,5d mark2) cameras to be able to use 6400 iso. My guess is you're using the kit lens. That again isn't made for low light. It's to slow. You need a fast lens 1.5-2 or so F   At this point one out of 50 will come out good :)<br>  <br>  Really the best thing for hem to do on a budget is to get remote flashes. Put a flash out where he plans to see the animals. You can buy really powerful strobe lights that will light up huge areas that might be a good idea too.|`|9q2zMOQkaa	Use a Higher ISO setting (800 to 1600) <br>  <br>  Use a tripod in Low Light<br>  <br>  Having a Lens with Image stabilisation IS<br>  <br>  The other option are brighter Lens (lower the F number) , but this can be expensive.<br>  <br>  17-55mm F2.8 IS  or a fixed lens 50mm F 1.8<br>  <br>  If the pictures are blank, Is the Lens screwed on properly to the 450D (it should click in), and .....

CKRfaRYvaa	This game should just charge you usage for the initial download, but you should call Verizon Wireless at 800-922-0204 to be sure.  A good general rule is that if the game has 'tournament' in the title or if it lets you play online with other people, then it will charge you usage every time.  If it doesn't, then it's probably just the one time for the download.

It was a great phone but for the hassel you get from T-mobile it isn't worth it.<br>  I constantly ran over my minutes and they charged me crazy fees.  My bills were over $300 a month. <br>  T-mobile (or at least when I had it) didn't offer nights and weekends for free.  They called it something else which is basically like rollover minutes that you used.

Cl8FwsI2aa	Turn down the LCD. The new iPhone's screen is brighter, but you shouldn't be running this thing at full heat if you want to save battery power. I keep mine at 10% brightness. Change this under Settings -> Brightness.<br>  <br>  Wi-Fi new network scanning off or Wi-Fi off. While you're not checking data for more than a few seconds at a time, I'd turn off Wi-Fi and in general, I'd turn off Wi-Fi scanning. It uses less power than EDGE or 3G but when you're not using your network connection, you might as well shut it down. Change this under Settings -> Wi-Fi. Same goes for Bluetooth.<br>  <br>  Turn off 3G  to preserve the battery life. Settings --> General --> Network --> Enable 3G --> Off.<br>  <br>  Set the Autolock to 1-minute. The iPhone's autolock is good at shutting off the screen if you forget to when placing it in a pocket, purse or just tossing it on a table after a call. I set mine to the most aggressive, 1-minute, but there are times where I set it to 2-minutes.

1HtTxOOQaa	Yes, sometimes I definitely have such a feeling when they unnecessarily argue to prove their points right. I mean how can a console be superior to it's opposition when the opposition has better games (well more exclusives now and even in the future), more features (Blu-Ray, wifi, bluetooth, FREE online...) and better reliability(lol 30 % failure rate vs 0.02 ha ha ha)? Statistics show that teens prefer the 360 cause it's cheaper and so they can afford it. PS3 on the other hand is expensive, but you do get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  The fact is that when someone advertises that their console is the best, actually shows their insecurity(uh um...360 fans listen). I believe if a thing is good, it will eventually prove for itself and not require fanboys to praise it or something. Just be happy with what you have and if you don't have a console you want but want to have one but can't afford it, shut the F*CK up and mind your own business. Enough fanboyism already. Don't ***** about something you haven't even played in your life. Be happy with what you have.|`|dCuWCbRkaa	I seriously think it is.  It's cheaper, so lots of parents will buy it for their kids.  Plus, you get on Live to play Halo and half the time it's 10 year olds that are like STFU you can't play worth the $hit you dumba$$.<br>  <br>  I have a PS3 and most guys sound about high school or college age and like are mature and don't just drop f bombs for the sake of doing it.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Actually the average age for someone who plays video games is around 32.

Many games on the platform are first person shooters, what guy wouldn't like to see blood splash all over the place? Not to mention that it costs less than a Ps3.<br>  The immaturity thing is a whole other issue. I'm sure 99% of those people have never even touched a PS3. The Ps3 and Xbox 360 are good in their own right. Ignore them, DO NOT FLAME! Flamming leads to banning, and no one wants that.|`|gqnyQ3L5aa	I own xbox 360 but I can say PS3 is definitely better from  technological point of view. The only reason I bought xbox 360 because I knew I can hack it and get games for free though I do pay for some games that I think is worth paying for. Quick someone report me to FBI  lol !!! People who think xbox is better are simply morons who lost ability to think. Firstly xbox is not that much cheaper it might seem this way but if you compare what comes with xbox and ps3 there is big difference. Ps3 comes with wireless and joysticks  have chargers installed in them. When you buy xbox you have none of these things if you want to have wireless and proper joysticks with charger (not damn batteries) you have to pay for all that stuff around 150-200 euro (it might be cheaper in US). So if you sum all that it comes about the same as PS3 ( well some people might not need wireless but lets face it most people use wireless these days) not to mention that you have to pay for damn membership if you want to play online games ( because of the greedy fcks at Microsoft), on PS3 though as I know game servers are free. And in general Ps3 is more powerful console then xbox and we will probably will notice that in near future. When someone says to you Ps3 sucks ask them why most of the time they have no answer lol. (sry for my english if I made any mistakes though I tried not to lol .|`|a8hbGnlOaa	haha well its the same with the ps3 a bunch of little kids playing and i have them both i prefer playing on xbox live =] plus xbox 360 has more games and it is dominating the ps3|`|dBpWY76Maa	because....IT DOES, i mean for real the 360 hardware is a little shitty, but the software is stomping on ps3, plus it's 200 cheaper, yeah for Microsoft|`|8XXBY1wlaa	yes... yes we are|`|0tJl0L5Raa	most video game console owners are kids...period. <br>  <br>  But yes, PS3 does suck.

DbQKHNYsaa	Verizon because they make excellent phones and their service rocks!|`|J0Ie3XJmaa	AT&T is better.|`|8SpJG9WVaa	I currently have Verizon and there are very few areas that i don't get service.

vEZormRBaa	Hi! I've had Virgin Mobile for a number of years now. The ringtone is yours to keep. They don't expire. Once it is downloaded to your phone, it will be there forever. But, if you switch phone models, you have to get new ringtones again. I had an old phone for 2 or  3 years, and even though your phone number and balance transfer over, your contacts and ring tones are stored only in the phone itself. So.. there you go... in short: <br>  <br>  Yep, the ringtone is yours permanently.  :)

j5Apt8hWaa	In general, the larger the format of the film or sensor, the larger prints can be made.<br>  <br>  Many photographers who make poster size images use medium format cameras, either ones that use 120 film or digital cameras made by Mamiya and Hasselblad.  Some use 4x5 view cameras exclusively when printing large prints of landscapes.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in using smaller cameras, then the Nikon D3x and Canon 5D are said to produce the best landscape, studio and architectural subjects.<br>  <br>  Of course in all the above cases, you will have to buy the appropriate lens for the subjects you tend to shoot.<br>  <br>  I use a special Sinar 4x5 view camera that folds flat for easy transport when hiking into the wilds of Arizona.<br>  <br>  When 4x5 transparency film becomes more difficult to process (as time goes on, there are less and less E-6 labs), I many have to spend the money on a Nikon D3x.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	OK!

The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

The more pixels in an image the sharper it will look in larger prints. It also allows for cropping on smaller prints while maintaining good quality. <br>  <br>  Digital cameras allow you to change your resolution setting anytime you wish. Choose settings based on the largest size photo you expect to print from the images you are shooting. Shooting at a resolution much higher than needed for the print size you intend to make will not yield a sharper photo. Higher resolution images create larger files which will reduce the number of images that will fit on your card and they may move slowly on your computer. High resolution files can be downsized in a computer, however this may negatively impact your image quality.<br>  <br>  Changing resolution will change how many photos you can fit on your memory card. Most cameras indicate how many photos you have left on a card, based on the resolution setting.<br>  <br>  PRICE DOES MATTER !!!

AbRfd29Haa	Yes, absolutely. <br>  <br>  Verizon uses a phone standard called CDMA... unlike GSM phones, there's no SIM card. But there sort of is.. it's just not removable. In your phone, usually under the battery, there's a code. That works the same as the SIM card -- it connects your phone number to any specific phone. <br>  <br>  You can take any Verizon phone in to a Verizon store and have them update your account to use that phone. They will probably charge you $10-$15 to do this. However, if you have a login for your account at <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com</a> (or if you can make one now), you can do the switch yourself for free. <br>  <br>  I did this, I'm not just guessing. Last fall, my Treo 700p stopped begin a working phone (the keyboard failed), but I happened on an generic Verizon phone at a yard sale for $2.00. So I figure, can't hurt.. got it home, and 15 minutes later, my phone calls went to the new phone.|`|1ghVv65Daa	Depending on the phone yes, but if you have insurance on the phone why not just get a new one. the phone you buy off ebay should be a verizon phone if you want there service.  <br>  <br>  Kandice|`|C2mau8DRaa	My answer would be yes. That is because if they are both verizon phones you can have it put into your number. Or what you can also do is call the verizon wireless customer service and ask them if you have warranty on your phone and if you do they can replace for a new one that may not be the same.|`|prlMQgDLaa	Yes they can.

YupMCYHlaa	A mic puts out an analog signal.  It's meant to be connected to an amplifier, and then to a tape recorder or public address system or radio transmitter, something like that.<br>  <br>  A USB port is a digital port.  For a mic to be connected to a USB port requires some electronics, an ADC--analog to digital converter--which converts the analog signal to digital bits and bytes.  Mics that plug into USB ports have this built into them.  Or you can buy various boxes that you can plug a mic into, and other analog sources, and it plugs into the USB port.  Sometimes it is a mixer too.<br>  <br>  Google 'USB microphone converter' and you'll see what's available.  Also companies like Creative Labs make a number of 'external sound cards' that have connections for speakers, mic and line level inputs, and plug into USB.  There's an advantage in this, the inside of the computer is electronically very noisy, so you get a cleaner signal if you use an external box (though it's a little more expensive).

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	You want a.) a Blu-ray player and b.) a home theater system.  HT systems can be packaged (aka HTIB or home theater in a box) or DIY where you assemble all parts (receiver, speakers) yourself.  If you don't know much about these things or don't care to do the research, go wtih an HTIB.  Those are almost always inferior to DIY systems, but it's much easier for the unintiated.<br>  <br>  You don't want an HTIB centered around a player (i.e. DVD or Blu-ray).  Such systems are very limited in their connection options and most don't allow expansion.  So what you want is a receiver-based HTIB.  In my opinion the best value HTIBs (and receivers in general) are made by Onkyo.  If you want one that's HDMI compatible, start with the HT-S6100.  There's the 7100 too, which I think is just the 6100 with speaker stands and a slightly different receiver.  The king of the hill is the HT-S9100THX.  It meets THX's standards for audo quality.<br>  <br>  If you want to DIY, you'll need to do some research.  Read forums, ask questions, etc.  Look for Pioneer, Yamaha, Denon, Harmon/Kardon and Onkyo receivers.  For speakers you can either buy piece meal or go with packaged 5.1 sets.  I am partial to Polk Audio.  Just search "Polk 5.1" on Amazon for some ideas.<br>  <br>  As far as the Blu-ray player goes, I used to recommend the Panasonic DMP-BD35, but I think they stopped making them.  Sony's 550 and Samsung's 2500 are good models.  The new 2009 players should start coming out later in the month, so keep your eyes peeled for good deals on the 2008 models (if you can find them).<br>  <br>  Feel free to ask questions.  Good luck.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Well the 7.1 stems from the reciever... for that I'd recommend either Kenwood, American Acoustic or Yamaha. They are all fine reciever/speaker set ups.<br>  <br>  As far as the blue ray player? Get a PS3!<br>  <br>  Its the best blu ray on the market (still)... it updates automatically and gives you true 1080p with upscaling. Not to mention you get an awesome video game system and all that entails.<br>  <br>  If the Ps3 is not your cup of tea then get a standalone Sony blue ray player. They did invent it after all.|`|hL7g6pJ0aa	For a player, definitely go for a PS3.  It's the most future-proof player out there.  It has direct-update over the internet capability.  The hardware is not only top of the line, but about the same price as a standalone player, and has the added bonus of being a game machine (although games are unbelievably pricey).<br>  <br>  For a receiver, I would say stick with Sony.  Many of their receivers are built and tested with their own players.  They are reasonably priced as well.  However, just about any high end or medium high end brand will perform the way you want.

Between powering the bigger screen, interpreting the touch signals, changing the screen, your battery will die very quickly. I can’t give you an estimate on how long, though, because I don’t own a Power Monkey myself.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!
vQOFU4vCaa	Check out the Sony W-220 or any higher model in the W or T series by Sony. They control light really well and they come in a couple different colors. They are fairly quick to turn and a take pictures and are the very best point and shoots for night time or low light environments in general.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Many superzoom point- and- shoots, unlike their smaller counterparts, have options to add additional "attachments" in front of the lens that allows you to add teleconverters. Most superzooms comes packaged with plastic hoods. They attach to the lens barel of the superzoom camera. Hoods are designed to block light from entering from a diagonal angle, thus cutting out flare. Here are pictures of a superzoom with the hood attached: <a href="http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/assets/21363.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/asset...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/assets/21364.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/asset...</a><br>  Many superzooms also gives you options to add filters in front of the lens with optional adapters. One of the filters, called the "polarising filter", is designed to enhance colours and to prevent a subject from becoming "washed out". It's advantages include better contrasts in your photos. Check manufacture's websites on assessories.|`|NEFaTFHRaa	If you're going the small route, and had the cash, I'd definitely go with the Canon SD880. It goes for about $245 shipped.  It's gotten excellent reviews all over the internet and quite a following.  It's got a huge 3'' LCD screen, a better lens than the previous canon powershot series cameras (which is saying something), faster lens, as well as a unique button lay-out that allows you to shoot the thing one-handed if you wanted to.<br>  <br>  The "Canon A590 IS" is another cheaper option but excellent quality camera. ~$110.<br>  <br>  Canon is also unveiling a new 12x optical zoon powershot series camera this week at the 2009 PMA Convention.  You could check on the availability of that here in the next week or so.<br>  <br>  General rule of thumb: If you're going with at point and shoot camera, go with a Canon Powershot (at least for this day and time) Superior quality at their price range.<br>  <br>  However, if you really want to get into photography. I'd go with a Nikon D40 SLR kit with a 18-55 starter kit lens. ~$450.  You'll then be able to capture motion in pictures as well as have a lot more control over the smaller aspects of picture making that result in huge changes.<br>  <br>  More resources on these cameras can be found on flickr.com and then do a camera search. It's also worth noting that no camera will get you the perfect picture. That relies upon the photographer and a skill set involving a creative eye and patience.<br>  <br>  Link: <a href="http://www.jr.com/canon/pe/CAN_SD880ISGOLD/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jr.com/canon/pe/CAN_SD880ISGO...</a>|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28.

Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands.

YlyN73Jnaa	Explain to your parents that if there is an emergency you can call them and let them know where you are and when you'll be home. Like if you will be waiting at the bus stop after school for a long time because of some unfortunate mishap or accident, or if it is okay for your friend's mom or dad to drive and give you a ride home. Or if you are at the mall or the movies with your friends, you can call them and let them know that you're coming home now, or you may be late for an important reason. Also, tell them that they will be able to use the telephone more often because you have your own phone if you want to talk with your friends. Tell them that you are responsible enough to carry it around in your backpack and bring it to school every day, and to charge it when it needs to be charged. Remind them of a time when you were responsible and kept track of your own belongings or their belongings so they will believe you and trust you. Otherwise, your parents sound strict and there is no other possible way to convince them into saying yes, they will just say no. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|k2NRCYo9aa	Here's some food for thought....<br>  <br>  If you have a cell phone, your parents will then be able to know where you are 24-7, and will be able to call you 24-7.

Maybe once they see that you are using the prepaid responsibly they will agree with you and let you get on their plan. Do your parents give you a reason for not letting you get one?|`|x8Jdcdpdaa	Just say that you really need one for emergencies. How are they going to know where you are?|`|1fjhg6j4aa	When I was a teenager, there were no such things as cell phones.  I had quite a few extracurricular activities, and I made it through my teenage years alive and well.  So, you really don't need a cell phone.  A cell phone would be convenient and cool, and you would like to have one, but you really don't need one.<br>  <br>  If your parents felt that you really needed one, they would get you one.  Have you actually sat down and talked to them without getting emotional or an attitude?  Have you tried to have a mature, level-headed discussion with them about it?|`|331e6b1a584448c0381304334da2febdaa	For an extra $5 a month with verizon, your parents can set controls on the usage of your cell phone.  It's called usage controls.  Your parents can designate trusted numbers, and block others.  They can even receive notification when you are about to go over your allotted minutes or text messages.  <br>  So, between offering to pay for the extra line, probably about $20 with taxes and all, and offering them the flexibility to control how much you use the phone, they should allow it.  Good luck!|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Your second paragraph says that you are a self-centered, rebellious and only want people to say what you want to hear.

dC7d5sy5aa	HDMI means a simpler and higher-quality entertainment experience. It provides the highest possible uncompressed video and audio quality over a thin, easy-to-use cable with a simple, consumer-friendly connector. It’s also backwards compatible with DVI, requiring only a simple passive adaptor or cable to connect between the two interfaces. <br>  Most importantly, it adds support for up to 8 channels of full-resolution digital audio, all on a single cable. HDMI has the ability to transmit basic control codes from device to device, making the goal of system integration easier to achieve. <br>  HDMI addresses the complexity issue by both reducing the cable count and easing the process of interconnecting the various devices that make up the typical home entertainment system. Instead of having to choose among RF, composite video, S-video and component video and optical digital audio or coax-based digital audio, everything can use a single HDMI connection. For example, in the case of a DVD Audio or SACD Audio capable DVD player, a single HDMI cable can replace up to 10 other connections (3 for analog component video, 1 for optical or coax digital audio and 6 for the 5.1 multichannel analog audio outputs). <br>  Added to this is the ability to simultaneously achieve the best possible audio and video quality due to the uncompressed all digital signaling of HDMI.<br>  <br>  The most recent version of HDMI, more than doubles the bandwidth of the signaling from 4.95 gigabits per second to 10.2 gigabits per second. This increase in bandwidth enables greater color depths, higher screen resolutions and faster refresh rates. It supports the new xvYCC color space, adds support for the Dolby ? TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio standards, provides a mini-connector for use with camcorders and digital still cameras, and supports the ability to automatically and accurately adjust the audio to maintain lipsync with the video image. <br>  <br>  Quality:<br>  Because HDMI is a digital interface, it provides the best quality video since there are no lossy analog to digital conversions that are required for analogue connections (such as component or S-video). The difference is especially noticeable at higher resolutions such as 1080p. Digital video will be sharper than component, and eliminates the softness and ghosting found with composite. Small, high contrast details such as text bring this difference out the most.<br>  <br>  Ease-of-use:<br>  HDMI combines video and multi-channel audio into a single cable, eliminating the cost, complexity, and confusion of multiple cables currently used in A/V systems. This is particularly beneficial when equipment is being upgraded or added.<br>  <br>  Intelligence:<br>  HDMI supports two-way communication between the video source (such as a DVD player) and the DTV, enabling new functionality such as automatic configuration and one-touch play. By using HDMI, devices automatically deliver the most effective format (e.g. 480p vs. 720p, 16:9 vs. 4:3) for the display that it is connected - eliminating the need for the consumer to scroll through all the format options guessing what will look best.<br>  <br>  HD Content-Ready: <br>  HDMI devices supporting HDCP (copy protection) will have access to premium HD content now and in the future.|`|IbxhRebgaa	High bandwidth, why else? <br>  <br>  Most people can't tell the difference between 1080i via Component and 1080i via HDMI. I am one of those people. If you're like me, however, there's still the benefit of not having to run separate audio cables from your source to your monitor/speakers.

p1dcw35Qaa	Remove the yellow and white rca cables from the tv and hook them into the vcr inputs. Then run coax or yellow video, red and white audio to the tv input. If your vcr doesn't have the yellow rca video input, you can go to Radio Shack and tell them what your doing. They'll sell you a converter (most VCRs have a yellow composite input though). Once it's hooked up, you can put the vcr/tv switch to vcr and watch the cameras through the tv and record what's being shown.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Use a seperate video cable from the VCR to your video camera system.

edaNo7DOaa	It depends on what kind of ipod you have. If it is an Ipod Nano then hold down the menu button and the center butter at the same time. Any other ipod you might need to restore the ipod and then put everything back on. But this happened to me once and it was because that particular ipod did not play movies or videos. So that could be the problem. If none of this works then I am not sure what is wrong. But who knows Apple is crazy!|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	reset it<br>  unplug the ipod<br>  press the menu and the center buttons at the same time until the apple appears then plug ipod in and sync|`|fhVj1fMUaa	oh mine does tht all the time.. i ignore it and disconnect anyway.. nothing bad happens... like my ipod doesnt break or anything.. so ya<br>  thts wat i do

If u have a pda like a blackberry palm or htc it will cost 125.00 anything else cost 50.00. Call this number and see what they say its the insurance number 1-888-562-8662. See what they have to say. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  You wont have to pay the difference for the same phone. and not all of them are refurbished trust me.

DONT LISTEN TO HIM.|`|IaF0voEQaa	if you have a lost/ stolen phone, then the insurance covers it.

Dfr6uA91aa	Blue? The TI-84+ SE calculator has a monochrome display, meaning it can only display black and a few shades of gray. If you're seeing blue, then that indicates a problem with an LCD display driver.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you just mean something like the contrast being screwed up (which I guess could look a bit blue) then just press/hold [2nd][(Up)] to make the screen darker, or press/hold [2nd][(Down)] to make it lighter.
4gyrvY7Jaa	You should try resetting your PS3. If that doesn't work, there might be a problem with your disk, which is very unlikly, due to Blu-Ray disk durability.|`|FIL4vngsaa	Yeah, same thing happens to me.<br>  I just keep trying a few time again and it doesn't come up.<br>  You could also try this:<br>  <br>  While the system is on and in the game menu, put your finger on the power button (on the front) and hold for about 10 seconds for 2 beeps.<br>  <br>  Then turn it back on again.<br>  This basically resets the console. No changes made to any part of the system.
08cYUAW3aa	Yes, sadly it does cost money to receive a text. That's why my bill is so high. 3 random people texted me too. I have to pay for texting each month.  I think it's about 75 cents per message i don't know... Maybe your mom's phone has the same number as another phone...I once knew of someone who had the same number of another random person in Mexico.... If the person continues to text your mom, tell verizon...|`|Axi9yDabaa	Yes, if you don't have a plan, it most likely will cost.|`|pNmCYpnqaa	Yes, it costs like 25 cents a message.

However, if you do fit it on a DVD, it will be played in SD, not HD. But when played in a Blu-ray player, it will upscale it to HD, so unfortunately there will be minimal quality loss.

OhTPygYlaa	The good:<br>   The HTC Fuze for AT&T ships with Windows Mobile 6.1, push e-mail capabilities, and a good helping of multimedia features, including a 3.2 megapixel camera. Other highlights include a full QWERTY keyboard; VGA touch screen; Wi-Fi; Bluetooth: GPS; and HSDPA support. <br>  <br>  The bad:<br>   The HTC Fuze doesn't have a standard headphone jack, and the smartphone is a bit bulky. Speakerphone quality isn't the greatest and streaming video can cause the phone to stall. It's also pricey.<br>  <br>  The bottom line:<br>   For AT&T business customers who demand the most out of their smartphones, the HTC Fuze is up to the task, delivering plenty of features, good performance, and a functional design. <br>  <br>  Specifications:<br>   OS provided: Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional ; Installed RAM: 288 MB ; Processor: QUALCOMM 528 MHzMSM7201A
RVy0yKgHaa	You may have purchased the 30 Minute one. Make sure that is the 60 minute camera. I have the 60 Minute one, and sometimes it will say that I have 60 minutes and 36 seconds left or something, so there could be the possibility that you have the wrong version. If it cost you about $120 or so, that should be the 60 minute one. If it was $70 or $80, thats the 30 minute one.

jBIotay5aa	Yes, you definitely can.This could be a very expensive project though. You will need a power supply to your subwoofer. Because of your subwoofer requiring a 12 volt supply, you'll need a 110 or 220 volt AC to 12 volt DC convertor. That's not the end of it though. The power supply needs to be rated to supply the rated current of the amplifier (a bigger power supply would be preferable roughly double the current rating of the amplifier) You can check the amplifier fuses for current rating. It is also advisable to have a power supply with a regulated output, meaning that the output voltage would stay constant even with heavy bass notes and current draw. Good quality convertors are expensive especially the bigger they get.

The same idea applies for the playstation 3 if you have the playstation 1 or 2. There are different types of xbox 360s, arcade, pro, and elite. Elite is the best but really expensive. Arcade is said to be really bad but really cheap, but I don't think it's worth the money. Pro is in the middle in reviews, the money and bytes. So if your going to get an Xbox 360 get the Pro. But the playstation isn't as good as the Xbox so choose between Xbox 360 and Wii. Wii is more family but Xbox is violent and usually single player. It depends if your family likes video games or not.|`|u2hK47Ncaa	It depends on you want kind of games you play. If you play a lot of multiplayer games you should get the wii.
