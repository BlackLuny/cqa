I know they have, so why couldn't the Russian government just spend a few Trillion more and everything would turn into a paradise?      In Russia the government actually controls the economy and yet the government can not prevent a recession - wouldn't increased government spending by the Russian government fix this?

I am in the process of creating a DVD with footage from a paintball game in which I hosted. It is a scenario game that is based around real events.

20090219205448AAlkRL1	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Do you know of any business that wire money out of this country instead of depositing funds to avoid claiming?	I worked for a bank with  one of our customers being a collection agency. Among many customers was a large well known  insurance co,  they collected money for was a special acct under another name but was for "uninsured motorist" for the auto company, one of their customers, that they had to pay claims out on, because they could not recoup from the other insurance company because "there was none" and took the collected money from people to recover costs by threatening ruining credit to pay back since it was illegal not to have insurance   . The  collection agancy said that the money had to be wired out of the country  rather then deposited into the account so no record would be on bank statements so that the govt would not get on insurance agency for collecting what they claim they did not get  due to  uninsured  motorist that cost the insurance industry much money and a good reason for the high rates they charge to make up for their losses ,covering  the deadbeats that they could not collect from at high cost everyone, yet did actually collect. Actually there not a loss as claimed.(Sounds like the insurance industry is again the frauder)  It has occurred to me that if the insurance industry does this, there are probably other companies that do this,  the  recent swiss bank accounts news  made me think of it.    I realize there are many business secrets that are legal to do, but many of them do not seem a bit ethical to  me. Another one was the insurance company law firm bought basket ball season tickets at high price from another law firm in building and they called it "charitable contribution"  I guess as long as a company can produce a receipt or cancelled check to accountants they can get away with business outings that regular people are unable to do. Have you worked for a company that did special little deductions that are like this? It sure seems that there are many loopholes as they call it, but how do they find out what they are, from their accountants? What secrets do you know that larger business is able to do?

20090219205459AAzCOYZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Accused of shoplifting?	um so me and my friend were accused of shoplifting from a store for candy and coke ... but we werent technically stealing anything what happened was how should i start we walked in the store and went in the candy aisle to buy candy (this was in safeway btw) so we walk to the front and we both grab a coke near the register and we got to a line but i needed some milk so we went to the back and we stopped and got in a arguement cause i needed money to buy the milk i told my friend to wait in the back while i go out and grab more money and she could hold my stuff for me and wait in the store she said it would look 2 suspicious if she stayed back there with a crap load of candy (they were bags not those candy bars) and 2 cokes ... i told her sit on the floor and look like ur making the world a better place somehow but she didnt cooperate i think this is where i meesed up cause i couldnt exactly carry all the candy so i put 1 of the bags in my jacket pocket and had it stick out so the public could c it was there and i wasnt going to leave without paying ... erm so we walk towards the front and we were lined up with the cash registers and she was following behind me we get to a point where we had to stop and i turned around ready to hand her my stuff then the loss prevention guy starts racing across the store and i heard him yell nonononono so i turned around and stared at him run towards me and he like pratically tackled me when i was standing in place i told him i was going to grab my wallet (it was really a seperate wallet so that was bad to and i had my wallet on me so it looks like i was lying no hope there) ... he dragged me across the store while my friend followed behind and asked us questions i dont know how many times there supposed to ask u if u stolen from the store before but this guy kept pushing us after we told him before we took nothing at all and um he said the whole reason why he followed us throghout the store was bcuz he mistook my friend for a guy(she is a girl so i think thats bs) and he said his name and everything after he pushed us to admit to something we didnt do so the police came and ya we were joking around to keep  calm but you shouldnt joke in situations like these we werent aware the police were contacted and ya they gave us a citation for shoplifting under concealment my question is if your not passed the register wtf am i still in the store or what? and i didnt even make it out the dam door so wtf? and ya i was caught with things i hadnt payed for YET but wtf?

20090219211334AApkjLM	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should the power to make marijuana laws be reserved to the states or delegated to the federal government?	I'm doing a research project on marijuana and I think that should be a reserved power for the states to make laws regarding marijuana and it's use due to the 10th amendment (“the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or the people.”). there are many things that the supreme court has ruled on that haven't been in the constitution and the court has sided with the states (abortion is one example).       for instance:  the DEA was was formed by an Executive Order in July 1973 by President Richard Nixon to form “an all-out global war on the drug menace". that order is over 25 years old. how can it be expected to rule the ever-changing society?   Since the Order was enacted, the annual marijuana arrests in the United States have nearly doubled but the US population has only grown about 40 percent. Furthermore, the budget of the DEA has grown more than 3500 percent in that same time period from $65.2 million to $2,345.9 million. how is that right?   The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision in the case of Raich v Ashcroft in 2005 upheld the Controlled Substances Act as an exercise of federal power, giving Congress the right to ban the use of cannabis even where states approve of it’s medicinal use. That does not seem right seeing as every state is different and laws should be made to fit those states. i think the states should be given the power to make laws regarding marijuana use. the federal government should not be involved because it does not involve interstate commerce.       that's my "legal" opinion. what do you think?      ***sources: NORML, NPG, DEA, Drug Policy Alliance Network

My car was making a funny noise and jerking so I had my husband (his license is suspended) to drive me up to the store cause I was scared to drive. Bad idea, we got pulled over...but a couple of the things the cop did had me wondering.      I was in a fender bender a month ago and my front end had a little damage and one headlight out...knowing this, I do not take the car out at night. The police officer said that he was pulling us over for operating a vehicle with defective equipment. It was 5 in the afternoon and the sun was up...is it really illegal to have a headlight out in the daytime???   He arrested my husband for the suspended license and the defective equipment. He had him in the car and he came to me and asked if there is anyone I can call to come get me, I said, I have a license, can't I just take it. He said no, it is being impounded for defective equipment. He asked me if I had ever been arrested, No. He asked what kind of trouble I've been in, I told him Ive never been in trouble. He asked me if there was anything in the car that was illegal. I said no. He told me to get out and stand by his car, and he started searching the car! Doesn't he have to have permission?? He didn't ask. He just started digging through my purse and shopping bags and the car. I have never been in trouble and he ran my ID, he knew that. Can he just go through my stuff like that. I thought he had to have a reason?      When he came back to tell me how much my husbands bond was gonna be, I asked him if I could get the debit card from my husband (handcuffed in the backseat) he said 'does he HAVE that much in the bank?' WTF?? And then when I gave him the card to run at the station, he said it came back declined. I told him to do it for a couple hundred less, and he said it came back declined again.    Came home and checked my balance, sure enough, it is all in the bank. Jerk.

No, the US isn't one; the government has actively involved in infrastructure investments since the 19th century.      Nor is Britain, nor any other country. Every single country that has ever developed has had a mixed economy (excepting the USSR, which was able to leverage vast resource inputs to exchange for capital), which seems to utterly annihilate the pet fantasy that government's role in the economy is purely detrimental.      I suppose the real question is then "why do people most staunchly support policies which have no proven record of success?"

I'm 25 with a college degree, but I have a neurological disability that gives me limited to no job abilities, but my brother, who is more mentally impaired than I am, lied to me & said he's mentally functional enough to live independently.

He forcefully verbally pressured me into letting him come here, & I told him I can't let him stay here. He came anyway. He's 31 & supposedly can't count $$. He has an expired state ID from another US state, so the homeless shelter only let him stay 1 night. He really put a big inconvenience in my life.

Now, she's angry because she doesn't have the power to misuse his $$ like the rest of the family, & she threatened to get my SSI & Soc. Sec. Survivor's benefits cut off.       My brother wanted me to help him get his own place, & the people @ the local SSA office said he can live in his own apt., & he doesn't have to stay with me in order for me to be his payee, but just make sure his bills get paid on time & give him what's left over. I'm the only person in this family that's honest enough to do that.      But now my mom is making threats @ me. I currently have no money until Feb. 27. I'm not willing to break my lease for someone else & then get evicted. & it's not my fault my brother has a 2-yr. expired state ID. I didn't ask to be his payee. He wants to be his own payee, but his Dr. says he's not mentally capable, so he nagged me constantly about me being his payee.      He flipped the story around & lied on me because he's mad @ me because I told him he can't stay here.

If you could ask an unborn fetus this question...which answer do you think the unborn fetus would pick?      "Hey you in there, decision time!

We let you grow to full term, you're born & given away to someone else who will raise you as their own"      OR      B. We will either hack you up into 1,000 tiny pieces, then suck you out & throw you in the trash can or inject saline solution into your lungs until they fail to function, then suck you out and into the trash (we won't tell you which method we will use, we will surprise you).

I live in PA and a friend of mine, ignorant of the law and scared by police, gave a false confession. It was for 2 murders in the 3rd degree in Upper Darby, Pa. He had a PD who didnt care for his case and told him she wouldnt beat it.  8 days before his trial was to begin the DA and his PD offered him deals he finally took the 17-38 yr deal after told if he didnt, he would do life. Plead guilty.His DNA and fingerprints from the gun came back negative and im positive they never would have came with a single "deal" if the could prove beyond reasonable doubt he did this. They couldnt. Everyone in the neighborhood knows the name of the guy who did it but nobody has came forward. He didnt have good advice or guidance and its so so sad. there has to be something i can do! any suggestions?!!

Why doesn't this get aired on our television? Canada is the greatest ally the USA has, it's America's #1 trading partner, it's the #1 supplier of oil and gasoline to the USA, AND Canada has its troops in Afghanistan helping to battle the Taliban and Al Qaeda.       Why can't the US be more open-minded towards Canada and Canadians?

The Democrats take control of both the House and Senate.      11-4-2008 The Dow was at 9925.28. B. Hussein Obama is elected President of the United States.      Today the Dow is at an abysmal 7465.95 and falling.      It would seem like everything was fine until the Democrats took control of the House and the Senate...but since then we have LOST 4690.82 points in the Dow.       Yeah...yeah...I know it's all Bush's and the Republican's fault. But how do you explain this:      11-9-1994 The Dow was at 3830.74. The Republicans took control of the House and the Senate.      11-7-2006 The Dow was at 12,156.77. The Democrats took control of the House and Senate.       Today the Dow is at 7465.95 and falling.      Twelve years of Republican control produces a gain of 8326.03.   Less than two and a half years of Democrat control produces a LOSS of 4690.82.      I know...I know...it's all Bush's and the Republicans fault. Yeah...Yeah...couldn't have anything at all to do with the Democrats. Yeah...Yeah....it's about more than the Dow....Which is why before the Republicans took office unemployment was at 7.5% and now that the Democrats have been in control for over two years we are right back there!

I couldn't take it anymore and that's why I hit the other guy.      But the thing is, he got away clean. Not a single day of suspension. I know what I did was wrong, but what about his actions?      My code of conduct said that the assistant principal's responsibility is to FULLY investigate the case before making a decision. He refused to bring any of my witnesses that can testify that I was threatened first and just suspended me because I "hit him first."      I remember that two girls also fought at my school and ended up bloodied. Guess what their punishment was? Only a three day suspension.      Plus, I'm Asian. I don't want to be ignorant, but I can't help but to feel that a bit of racism was involved in this.      The other boy also threatened to fight me AT SCHOOL to my face.      I threatened to fight him over MySpace and they used my messages as evidence.      The assistant principal, however, really didn't do anything when I told him that the other boy wanted to fight me first and that I have plenty of witnesses to testify for me.      Please help me out!

20090219220848AAhb6VP	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this Hypocritical About Abortion?	Okay, first of all I'm a Catholic, and the Catholic church preaches against abortion. Now I personally am against abortion. For example, if my wife got pregnant and she wanted abortion I'd be upset.       Now here's the hypocritical part: let's say I'm signing a law about abortion. I feel just because I'm against it doesn't mean I have the right to restrict others from it. Sure I'd be hurting my Catholic faith, but I feel it's not right to tell someone else they can't do this or that just because I personally disagree with it.       Is that against my Catholic faith that just because I'm against it doesn't mean I wouldn't force my ideas on someone else in means of signing laws, threats, etc.      By the way no "baby killer" comments or "you're a terrible person" or I WILL NOT hesitate to report you. Believe me, I'm a very competent writer and have gotten reports filed and successfully enforced/acted upon.

20090219223329AAO2VBA	Politics & Government;Elections	Why didn't Nancy Palosi check Priceline before she went to Italy?	Here we go again. I'm not going to bash her or insult her which is my usual modus operandi. This time I'm giving her the total benefit of the doubt. I presume you have been watching CNN who is commenting on her trip to Italy and the cost to taxpayers. Let's get beyond that for a moment. The point is that she and her cohorts took a private jet which, according to CNN, costs $10,000 an hour to operate. They also said that the total trip costs $200,000.00 but they can't confirm that yet.   So I went to Priceline and checked four(4) round trip tickets from KSFO to Rome, Italy. I also gave her the benefit of first class arrangement over business class. So, sombody please help me out. Here's what I got in what should be a comfortable scenario for her:        http://www.priceline.com/travel/airlines...       Is that price include the total for four tickets like I asked? If you look to the right, it sure seems to. Both American and United Airlines seem to pretty much have the same offer. Even if you did multiply that by four, it's still well, well over $100,000.00 of savings over what she pulled off. Ok, wait a minute. I'll do the math and say around $51 or 2K and throw in the hotel for 4 grand? The total would have to be less than $60,000; please. You can go to any travel agency and do better than what she just did.

20090219223713AAMVUg8	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is it only after the Democrats took control of the House and the Senate did we have problems?	The Stock Market:      11-7-2006 The Dow is at 12,156.77. The Democrats take control of both the House and Senate.      11-4-2008 The Dow was at 9925.28. B. Hussein Obama is elected President of the United States.      Today the Dow is at an abysmal 7465.95 and falling.      It would seem like everything was fine until the Democrats took control of the House and the Senate...but since then we have LOST 4690.82 points in the Dow.       Yeah...yeah...I know it's all Bush's and Republicans fault. But how do you explain this:      11-9-1994 The Dow was at 3830.74. The Republicans took control of the House and the Senate.      11-7-2006 The Dow was at 12,156.77. The Democrats took control of the House and Senate.       Today the Dow is at 7465.95 and falling.      Twelve years of Republican control produces a gain of 8326.03.   Less than two and a half years of Democrat control produces a LOSS of 4690.82.      I know...I know...it's all Bush's and the Republicans fault. Yeah...Yeah...couldn't have anything at all to do with the Democrats. Yeah...Yeah....it's about more than the Dow....Which is why before the Republicans took office unemployment was at 7.5% and now that the Democrats have been in control for over two years we are right back there!      Yeah...Yeah...didn't adjust for inflation...blah blah blah...      Facts are facts...deal with them!       http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/cha...       Unemployment:         November 1994 Unemployment is at 5.6% the LOWEST it had been during Bill Clinton's Presidency.      November 2006 Unemployment is 4.5% which is about the average throughout the Bush Presidency. But the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate.      Today unemployment is 7.6% after less than two and a half years of the Democrats in control of the House and the Senate. In fact under President Bush the HIGEST unemployment BEFORE the Democrats took control of the House and the Senate was 6.1% and that happened during the two year period 2001-2003 that the Democrats held a one vote majority in the Senate!          http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOu...       Believe me folks...it's NOT eight years of Bush, (Even though I am certainly NOT a fan), it's two and a half years of Demcrats and the facts are plain to see!  Lower stock market and higher unemployment only began AFTER the Democrats took control of the House and Senate and the evidence is undeniable!

You know, those **** recruiters will lie and say just about anything to get you to sign eight years of your life away.  Oh, BTW, I did receive an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in case any of you were wondering.  I am just bitter because I feel that the Marine Corps has hindered me in more ways than it has helped me, That's all.

20090219183231AA8mUNa	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Copyrights and Patents for games?	A while back I remember reading an article online about some people that made a clone of the game Scrabble -- they called their game "Scrabulous" and it was apparently very popular on Facebook. The owners of Scrabble filed suit against them and I believe they won. Now I would agree with the results of this suit because from what I understand, they basically copied the game board exactly from Scrabble, same rules, same scoring, etc. and the name they used for the product was essentially copying Scrabble. But I am curious -- how much of a change does someone have to make to their game clone before they run into problems? I mean if the Scrabuluous people had changed the rules to be different from Scrabble would it have been okay? Changed the tile values? Changed the tokens used on the board? How much?      Another example would be Monopoly. Everyone knows its a board with various properties around the perimeter, free parking, jail, etc. If you renamed the properties, and changed the rules I'm sure the Monopoly people would still freak out and sue.      Then there are games like Uno and Crazy Eights -- essentially the same game, but one game is protected (Uno) and the other one is just a knock off of it.      Other examples -- solitaire, various flavors of solitaire. Basketball, soccer, tennis, etc...      What is the difference? How different do you have to make your game before you run into trouble?

The reason I asked is that when Al Sharpton et al. speaks, the press and society ascribes that point of view to all African Americans. As if blacks and other minorities lack individuality.  I know blacks that are Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, and those that are Independent. I imagine that some of my black Republican friends cringe when they view the racist garbage on this site. When whites are outspoken or err in judgment we site that as an individual act. But when an African American is outspoken (as seen in heavy rotation on Fox) they are seen as representing every person of color. So let's be fair. Name one person who speaks for ALL of white America.

Exercising sweeping emergency powers buried within Presidential Decision Directives (PDDs), unelected officials could suspend the Constitution, declare martial law and create an Executive Branch dictatorship that rests solely on the power of the U.S. military.      Most troubling, Executive Branch officials under secret rules of a COG regime could suppress and usurp the lawful powers of Congress and the Judicial Branch (by force of arms if deemed necessary) as a means of ensuring "cooperation" under a "unitary executive."      Top Bush administration officials were busily revising Continuity of Government plans, including "civil disturbance" contingencies for suspending the Constitution and imposing martial law, long before the 9/11 attacks.

Okay, personally I didn't find the cartoon racist, but whatever, my question isn't really to debate that, though your opinions are welcome.       My question is a lot of people are saying they will boycott The NY Post until the Editor-in-Chief Col Allan & Rupert Murdoch are reprimanded/fired or as Al Sharpton would have it (god he's a douchbag) they are jailed. (yeah that d*mbass is actually "calling" for them to be jailed!)       Anyway so my question is if you compared all the people who said they will boycott if they are not reprimanded & compard them to all the people who should boycott if they are actually reprimanded, who do you think would win.       I say the people who would boycott if they got in trouble should out outweight the visa versa      Beside the people that will probably boycott the Post probably never even read it prior..it's like a vegan boycotting KFC, it's not like KFC is going to lose their buisiness now-they never friggen had it!

Why did the United States traditionally oppose imperialism?   (Points: 3)           because the U.S. military lacked the power of other nations              because the Monroe Doctrine was against it              because there were plenty of raw materials within U.S. borders, so there was no need to go outside              because the United States had originally been a colony and was against colonizing others            3. Both yellow journalism and the explosion on the battleship Maine contributed to the U.S. decision to go to war against Spain. What was another reason for going to war?   (Points: 3)           to prevent Spain from attacking Florida              to protect U.S. investments in Cuba              to stop Cuban nationalization of U.S. businesses              to keep Spain from attacking Venezuela            4. Which place did not play a role in the Spanish-American War?   (Points: 3)           Manila Bay              San Juan Hill              Havana              Mexico City            5. The treaty ending the Spanish-American War made the Philippines a U.S. territory. What was another provision of the treaty?   (Points: 3)           Haiti and the Dominican Republic became U.S. territories.              Spain would pay reparations to the United States.              Cuban independence was assured.              Panama agreed to allow the United States to build a canal there.

20090219164636AAhMK1T	Politics & Government;Elections	Why didn't obaama "fix" the economy in his own country?	That's right libs; simple question. After your boy, the pope obaama, got his education (that somebody else paid for) in this country, why didn't he go back to indonesia where he's from and revolutionize that third world country? What about his other home away from home Kenya? If your imported lib genius obaama is such a creative innovator, why didn't he go back to Kenya and work miracles there? In fact, that would be a great idea for a resume that this guy didn't have when he ran for President in the first place. For example, my experience in electronics is somewhat well versed and not some novice from ITT tech. My experience is in troubleshooting and not design. Yet I'm scrutinized in not having enough experience in a "specific" area. What experience and/or resume did this President you elected have? What credentials does this Indonesian have for you to hand this guy over $850,000,000,000.00 carte blanche, that this country doesn't have, because he says it's in my/our best interest, "or the economy will get worse?" Who the frig is he? I'll tell you who. Some imported lib socialist who read enough about U.S. history in Harvard or wherever in order to create a perverted interpretation of that history. Now, back to my question about his friggin homeland. Why were they cheering with outstretched hands when you elected this guy President? I'll do you a favor and answer that. It's because their own perverted destitute countries don't have anything to offer. The United States does, or rather did. Therefore, now that their homeboy rep is President of the United States, things are gonna "change". It's going to change alright; like casting pearls before swine. They know they don't have anything, so it's time to pilfer the country that does. I hope you lib socialists can afford the change because I know I can't help support that many pigs. More importantly, neither can future American citizens after me; that is, if there is a United States left in the future. Sorry to ask more than one question at a time, but here is another one. If you libs are so altruistic, why don't you move to indonesia or Kenya and "change" things there. Don't forget to take your leader obaama with you. Then, when you make your utopia of economic progress and prosperity in those freak countries, Obaama's homeland, then you will have a leg to stand on; vis-à-vis your democratic party's rant about change in the United States (?)

20090219172125AAbqyRs	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can my Girlfriends dad file a Restraining order?	Okay so.   So in October me and my girlfriend got together and we dated till December and then I got into some drug use. And her dad found out so he made her break up with me. And he HATES ME and never has liked me Even before the Drug thing.. and we have been living this BIG secret to hide our relationship from him.   And so i quit doing drugs and all that. and 2 weeks after we broke up we got back together.   And everything was going good. And in January i tried to call him and apologize to him and ask if i could date his daughter. ( Ha yes i know i already am)   And He didn't want to talk to me and made his daughter send a 2 page text to me saying all this stuff. And so he still doesn't like me.   And so on Tuesday of this week. My school got out a 2:35 and it was a blizzard so I called my dad to come and get me. And her dad or mom comes to picker her up at the elementary school next door at 3.   She has 2 siblings that go there.   So Me and her just were walking around and talking and holding hands.   And her dad comes walking up.   And asks '' What do you think your doing?''   I was like Ummmmmm.   And he said '' You better get going''   So i did.   Then i went home got on you tube and got a message from her saying her dad might file a restraining order.   I am 15 and She is 14 and we live in Utah.   Is this possible?      Oh yeah.   He told my girlfriend he has no problem with beating the Sh** out of me and doesn't care if he goes to prison. And she wrote a note telling me that. Which i still have.   And.   I have messages from my girlfriend telling me how much she loves me and all this stuff on youtube so i have proof im not stalking her or a threat to her.      So If i did get a restraining order Could i fight it? and what are the chances of winning. ( Yes i have a lawyer)

20090203111733AA6XzQA	Politics & Government;Military	Army Reserve Vs. National Guard (Advice)?	Sorry if this is long:      I originally talked with a Army recruiter and he got me through the ASVAB and so forth and getting ready to go to MEPS when I moved and transferred to a college. Joined ROTC and was given the option of going to LTC (Leader's Training Course) this summer to count as my basic (Since apparently it does now). The choice I have to make is whether to go National Guard or Army Reserve. Honestly I lean more towards the Reserve.       Now for the details:      I want an MOS of journalism, photojournalism, Public Relations, combat documentary, or anything along those lines. I was told through ROTC that they could guarantee me a MOS in what I want through the Guard, and that it would be harder to get said MOS in the Reserves.    Depending on how my time in service goes, I want to consider going carrier or at least longer than the 8 year commitment.       My Questions:   Do many people make go carrier in the Guard?    Which choice am I more likely to get the MOS I want?   Which choice am I more likely to get more opportunities with? (like Airborne school, or special units?)   Which choice is going to allow me to relocate a little bit more easier?      In closing:   I picked the military NOT because I'm looking for someone to pay for the rest of my education. I picked the military because I feel called to this line of work. I want to put my all into it, not just go for the benefits or side money. At this time in my life I want to give it my all.       Thank you in advance.

My AFQT was 95, but I don't understand how to read the Navy line score, and I won't be able to talk to a recruiter until Monday.      I have a feeling I meet the requirements of all the jobs I was interested in test-wise, however, unless I wanted to take the DLAB and see about becoming a CTI or something. However, I have a different problem and would like an answer:      My mother is not a US citizen. She moved here when she was 18 from Northern Ireland with her parents and siblings, she has lived over here the whole time - over twenty years.      I understand that if I want a job with Top Secret clearance, I cannot qualify with a parent that is not a US citizen. But if my mother became naturalized or started the process, would I theoretically be able to do it after that?      I know you can fail the background test very easily even without that definite block, but if becoming naturalized opened me to more of the job opportunities I was interested in then maybe she'd finally work on taking her citizenship test.      I told them going in that I was interested in legalman (would have to do something else entry level like Yeoman) or Intelligence/Communications, but it never occurred to me at that point that both my parents had to be legal citizens, only residents, and it didn't really occur to the recruiter to ask.

If you ask a homeless person if they wanted the conservatives to be elected or the liberals, they wouldn't care. If you were to ask someone with a family and money and a job, they would have a strong opinion. How does the government affect wealthy people more?

20090219201342AAb2n9v	Politics & Government;Politics	Have any of you experienced  this epiphany?	Hey. I'm 19 years old. I think I've realized something tonight. Have any of you experienced the same? Well, when I was 17, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer for various reasons. I decided to choose political science as a major because I find the subject matter very interesting and I also love history, and just knowledge in general. A little after I turned 19, I changed my prospective hopes with respect to my major from physics, biology, to math. Personally, I am not very strong in mathematics. I was in a phase where I thought I would conquer my mathematical deficiencies by just consuming and practicing the material. Well, long story short, I just realized that I wasn't at all that committed, strong in, or THAT interested in biology, physics, and particularly mathematics to actually major in them - even though I find the subject matter in all three fascinating (though biology is my favorite out of the three). So, I've come back full circle to settle on political science because I know that it reflects my strengths, and interests; political science combines history as well. On a side note, I have reduced my future job/career to either a teacher or lawyer, but we shall see what the future has in store...      I love history, I love science, and I am fascinated by how mathematics is knitted in everyday phenomena. I remember from a young age I always loved social science. I am generally interested in learning, and I greatly appreciate knowledge. So where I'm getting at is, I think that I am really interested in all of these things, but social science is my strong suit, even though I am fascinated by the sciences and enjoy my time watching my Nat Geo/Discovery channel programs and reading about them online. I think of myself as a type of renaissance man, if you will, in that respect. But I think I'm going to go with my strong suit and choose political science. I really enjoy the sciences, but I think I will leave that to reading and watching programs about science to feed my learning appetite for them. Because, maybe some of you have been here before, but haven't you ever felt after watching The Universe on the History Channel that you wanted to be a scientist and major in physics or biology? Ha ha.

20090219221721AAH9QMZ	Politics & Government;Politics	WHO'S TO BLAME FOR OUR CORPORATE RAPE?	Not in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would come across this!       A while back I did a post (WHO'S TO BLAME FOR THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN?) and just found this tonight. I had no idea the bill did this to us as well. The guys that created this bill are seriously the most disgusting slimes on the face of "We the People" I can even imagine... Wouldn't you agree?       "Congress passed, and the President signed on 12 October 99, sweeping new legislation creating powerful, one-stop financial supermarkets. The law had long been sought by the financial industry. It allows banks, insurance companies and investment companies (stocks and bonds) to merge, or affiliate, together into holding companies. The bill, numbered S. 900, and called the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act, unfortunately legalizes Orwellian privacy intrusions into our daily financial lives, with virtually no consumer protections.          How Does The New Law’s Information Sharing Provision Work And What Is Happening on July 1st? Since at least 1997, banks and other financial firms have shared your confidential experience and transaction information with their affiliates and with telemarketers. The new law’s modest privacy provisions provide that banks and other financial institutions must provide a notice of their information sharing policies and a limited right to opt-out (say no) to some sharing, by July 1st, 2001, or lose the right to continue that sharing. The law was designed to give companies the benefits of information sharing, without really protecting consumers. Under the law, companies can share all your “experience and transaction information” from your account relationship, with any of their affiliates, even if you say no. The law even allows companies to share this information with some third parties, as if they were affiliates, even if you say no. The law gives you only a limited right to “opt-out” or say no to information sharing with non-affiliated third parties, such as some telemarketers. Nevertheless, opting-out is still worth doing to prevent telemarketers from ruining your life. See below.          What is Experience and Transaction Information? How much money do you have in the bank? Who owns your accounts jointly? What do you buy with your credit card – airline tickets, medical expenses, beer? What is your Social Security Number? What is your account number? How much do you have in the bank’s investment affiliate accounts in what kinds of stocks? How much life insurance do you have? These are all types of experience and transaction information generated from your account relation with a financial institution.  Your medical records are protected by a separate law when held by hospitals, doctors or HMOs, but not from affiliate sharing when held by insurance companies affiliated with banks."      What sickos bent us over for thecorporate rape of our privacy rights (See above...), eeeww?

I only got detention once in sixth grade. (I know. Hard core.) I'm just wondering.      But I'm a vegetarian. I am one for ethical reasons, but if I accidentally eat meat, I get really sick because I find it so gross. What would I do in jail?      I'm also a crazy OCD clean freak with very bad anxiety. I MUST have baby wipes with me at all times, or I will panic majorly. And if I touch anything when I don't have baby wipes, I can't touch anything above my waste. I can't rewear clothes, pull clothes that I am already wearing above my waste (unless I take a shower right away) (I wear many button up shirts and things with zippers so I can pull them down), or pull clothes that have touched below my waist above my waist (I wouldn't be able pull overalls up the whole way.) If I can't do these things, I will cry and panic... Would they let me keep baby wipes, wear the overalls only partway up, and wear an undershirt I don't need to pull over my head to take off? Or would they let me go to a mental institution instead or something?
