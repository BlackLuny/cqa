I know that we are all programmed to believe that a college education is a godsend, however, is it really worth it? I have been going to school for over 3 years (I'm a college senior) and I noticed that I can't find a decent job, and to top it off the job that I'm at now is run by a bunch of people who are 2 years younger then me with half the eduction that I have. Its very frustrating. Did I mention that the people running the company that I work for are making 50,000 dollars a year while I'm making 5,000? I know, its sad. Give me advice, what should I do? Should I stay in school, or should I quit school and try to move up in my company? Thank you in advance for your answer.

Please find out the mistakes and suggestions. THANK YOU VERY MUCH   --------------------------------------...   You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.      International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not.   What are your opinions on this?      Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.      Write at least 250 words.   --------------------------------------...      In the recent decades, it has seen a considerable increase in global tourism throughout the world. There have a marked link between various forms of occupations and tourism, such as: hotel services. Certain people may consider the global tourism have a positive trend to become more common, meanwhile, other people do not agree with that. I personally believe the benefits of the development of the tourism far outweigh its drawbacks. The reasons for my position are as follows.      It is evident to seem tourists will spend a large amount of money during travelling in the host nation; they do not only spend for eating, but also spend for living and shopping and so on. Moreover, as the demand of certain occupations rise, the more and more people will be employed. Thus, the total economy of the country should be altered because of tourism.      In addition to, the reputation of the host nation and its local cultures can be built up when tourists come to visit. The Maori, the traditional tribe in New Zealand, has become famous; likewise, it attracts more and more tourists to come to New Zealand. Basically, most tourists enjoy and desire to learn various cultures around the world. It is good for both the nation and tourists.      Conversely, few people feel tourism has its drawbacks. Tourists may bring their own customers with them to the host nation, particularly their bad habit. For instance, certain western may think eastern tourist’s behaviours are different from them, western may afraid that these form of behaviours will be shown as same as people in their own nation. Nonetheless, individual behaviours should take the focus more on internal factors rather than the external factors. It is unfair to say all the changes of local people are affected by tourists.      I once again restate my position that I agree with the global tourism is a huge industry today, likewise, it is a position fashion that tourism brings benefits for most of the nations in the world.       --------------------------------------...   PS: I wrote about 333 words, is it too much?   THANK YOU

Hi, i'm currently in an online school that has no benefits   i've looked through the entire year and all of it was review from earlier grades. The whole online school is confusing and complicated. Even though its review, the way it is explained is so unclear, i'd have to be asking questions everyday. I've fallen major behind because i dont understand how their system works   After talking it over with my parents, we've decided to use a differnt school. a school that's number one in america   but you have to be accepted and they dont accept applications until march 2nd. If i stay enrolled in my current school im gonna keep getting calls and emails about falling behind and stuff (i'm already in their "academic advisory")   So i'm wondering if i can just be out of school until march 2nd, would that work?

I'm a Carer for my wife, i love her and have cared for her over 15 yrs now due to her illness, but i'm beginning to wonder if after all this time i have just been an idiot.    Everytime the Social Worker comes to see her i get remarks like 'Youre a great fellow, with what you do and sticking by your wife', bla bla bla and so on. My wife only wants to stay in bed, sleeping, and whenever i ask her to get up all she does is laugh or take no notice, she hardly washes or does work around the flat, unless we argue and i get her to do things, its the argueing thats finally getting to me. She promised to stop smoking but has not and like and idiot i let her get away with all or most things. The funny part is i still love her but again i'm beginning to have doubts if all what she wants is just someone to look after her and so i believe she is 'using me'   The Social Worker never seems to go against me but never really does much to help.    If this goes on much longer it could end up with me either in hospital or trying suicide as i don't feel i can cope too much longer. Its no use saying see your doctor or Social Worker as i have tried this before with no results, and quite truthfully i only think the Social Services are using me so they don't have to waste money finding a Specialist Home for my wife.   I am 60 yrs old now and even though i don't feel old my wife makes me feel like i am an idiot, my friends i don't doubt could very well be saying what an idiot i am for continuing with her.    So you have the choice to tell me, am i an idiot or a love struck person who does not know anymore what to do.

As Mrs Walker walks over to her front door she notices a shadow behind her husbands car, she walks over to the car and a man jumps out grabs her by the neck and covers her mouth he mumbled "don’t struggle, just come with me" Mrs Walker realised he had a knife in his pocket she tried reaching for it but the man hit her across the head and placed her in the boot of his car. Jim Walker, Mrs Walker’s husband, looked out the window when he heard the car speeding off, on the floor was Mrs Walkers bag, Mr Walker ran out picked it up and realised that the car that just sped off had Mrs Walker in it. That night Jim got a phone call saying "don’t call the police or she will die, i want 5 thousand pounds within three days" Jim didn’t know where to get that amount of money in a short period of time. Jim didn’t have to call the police as he was a police officer. When Mrs Walker awoke she was tied to a chair and her mouth had tape across it, it was pitch black and there seemed to be two men standing in the corners of the room. The next morning Jim searched all over the drive way for evidence on who took his wife but nothing was there except a small blue card with a logo of a tiger on it. At work Jim searched all over the internet to find out anything about this card but there was nothing. He tried looking for fingerprints there were none but there was a small black piece of leather behind his car.

I want to study anthropology at a large, urban school. I went to OSU and UW-Madison, and preferred UW because it was part of the city, unlike OSU which had a definitive campus. I'm also considering the University of Manchester in Britain because it has a lot of what I'm looking for.      It seems that most city schools are private and very expensive. I'm a good student and stand a chance at some top schools (NYU, U of Chicago...) but they're SO expensive.      I'm also considering UCLA and the University of Washington in Seattle, but I can't think of any other colleges to consider. I don't want to go to the Eastern or Central South, but anywhere else (including other countries) is fair game.

Other minority groups have fought tenaciously against stereotyping, and generally they have been successful.      2. He's usually a football player, muscular but dumb, with a face like a beer mug and only two ways of speaking - in a conspiratorial whisper to a friend; or in a drill sergeant's sudden bellow.      3. Broadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly speaking, corn-porn stands for self-approval.      4. Flashy sensation clogs up synapses. The cheapening of violence - not so much the number of incidents as their emptiness and light-weight gruesomeness - leads to both paranoia and anesthesia.      5. Violence dominates television news and entertainment, particularly what we call "happy violence" - cool, swift, painless, and always leading to a happy ending in order to deliver the audience to the next commercial message in a receptive mood.      6. On Jan. 24, the Fox network showed an episode of its hit drama 24, the real-time thriller known for its cliffhanger tension and often-gruesome violence.      7. A fire-breathing reptile is pretty much the same in any language. But the butchered version of the film that swept the world after release in the United States was stripped of the political subtext - and the anti-American, antinuclear messages - that had saturated the original.      *Sorry they're so long, it's for AP Language.

20090223100049AA2mRtp	Education & Reference;Special Education	What is the difference between sensory and emotional?	I answered a questionnaire a few weeks ago regarding my 2 yr old son’s overall development. Today a woman called me back regarding his results and said he passed his social/emotional but had some concerns regarding his developmental and sensory areas. I should have asked her to elaborate on what that means but I didn’t. I’ll call back later but I wanted to ask here since some of you have been through this.       What exactly does it mean to have sensory issues?      He’s going to be further evaluated next week. But this whole thing is eating me up. I feel like I failed as a parent or that I didn’t do something right. And especially because it felt like a slap in the face since I’ve never had ANY concerns with his development. Nor has his pediatrician. I’m not saying he has nothing wrong with him, because if he does, I’d like to get it fixed sooner than later. But still, I can’t help with these inner feelings that I have. And to top it off, my husband gets almost angry because he thinks that our son is fine. So it’s a double whammy!      Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Ok I know that I spell things wrong and my keyboard sticks, but I try my hardest to use the spell checker. My question is WHY do some of you people seem to intentionally spell every word wrong?

Yahoo went through the trouble of offering spell checker use it. Oh and stop writing in all caps. There is no need to yell and most people will not even read them. Last but not least...Why the need to be mean? I have been blunt with people but always with an actual point behind it. Some of you people are just mean for no reason at all.

20090223091820AAc4XEv	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Can I take graphic design classes at RISD if I am not enrolled in a degree program?	I am about to graduate from Virginia Tech architecture school and decided that I want to pursue a career in graphic design instead.  Architecture and graphic design are similar fields and I do have a good knowledge of the subject, but I would like a bit more experience that is specific to graphic design.  I am already knee deep in loans so, unless I receive a massive scholarship which seems unlikely, graduate school is out of the question.  I am very interested in RISD and have looked at their certificate programs, but they do not offer it for graphic design.  Would I be able to take a few classes in the undergraduate or masters programs if I am not enrolled as a full time student?  I know you can do this for many universities and programs, but architecture school reserves architecture classes for the full time students and I was wondering if it were the same here.  Also, has anyone tried just sitting in on any of these classes, and did the professor allow you to stay?  I don't really care about receiving any credits or degrees, I just want to get the experience and knowledge from quality teachers.

I missed my exams this semester due to illness, and I want to know what mark I would need to get in my re-sits in order to get 70% overall.      I'll tell you the results I have so far, and then if you would kindly tell me what I'd need to get I will love you all forever!!!      Module 1: I have done one essay worth 30% which has given me the mark 34 (which was a score of 68/100) so far. What would I need to get in the exam which is worth 70%? It confuses me so much!!!      Module 2: I did one exam worth 30% in which I think I got 72/100. I have a mark of 22 overall. I think that was 30% (it may have been 15 I really cant remember..sorry I am being so confusing). So what mark would I need to get on a paper worth 70% of the module to bring this up to 70?      Module 3: I did rubbishly on this. An essay worth 30% and only got 18. Again what would I need to get on an exam worth 70% to get 70?      Sorry for this being the worst asked question in the world. Thank you for any help you can give me.      xxxRosannaxxx

I gave the typical "ask who their councilors were or find an adviser who could handle the problem."      I wanna stick out in this interview, and I want to say something that will make them laugh.

She has been knowing the letter sounds since long. She is not able to put the sounds together to pronounce the words. I know it is early to do that but I am still asking for advices as I feel she really needs that at this moment. I read her a lot as she is so much dependent on me at this time. I think she wants to do that on her own, but she can not so she seeks me so often. She wants me to switch off the gas-stove and come sit by her, read her stories. But then who will do cooking for her(and for us)?      I taught my elder one how to read at age 4. She had started writing a bit by 4. So I just gave her workbooks and with little practice she started reading at age 4.25. I must mention that she is a wondeful reader and is doing amazing at her school(Now Grade 1).  Elder one loves reading so much that she makes sure to do that for one hour each day. Probably that is also one source of inspiration(and a bit of problem) for younger one. I want Reading to be quick for younger one because that way they will have reading time together with their own books. My elder one does read to younger but mostly for 10 minutes and then goes to her own books. They play a lot together. Younger one is very mature and elder one is very energitic so they get along very nicely. Somehow 'Not able to Read' is coming on the way. I don't want to be pushy but I just want to make it easier and quicker. However I know some kids need parents even after they start reading on their own, but I feel that won't be too much and I can make myself available surely for sometime.

I went for 3 months and then a family member died and I needed some time off. The school dropped me from class, and I petitioned to come back and was accepted. They told me I could start next mod, which they never started me. Apparently they leave the [restarts] until very close to start date and then if any [new] students dont fill the class seats then a restart might get in. Thing is... The school has been paid for just about my entire program, with school grants and loans. So why isnt my seat [which is already paid for] being held for me. NOW I have waited 8 MONTHS and over 4 mods have passed and I still am not in school & just recently I was sent a letter stating once I paid my remaining balance of $1,500 I would THEN be accepted back into the program!       Who can I report this to? There must be some agency that oversees these type of schools. I have tried talking to & emailing the school. NO ONE has answers and no one has fixed anything!!
