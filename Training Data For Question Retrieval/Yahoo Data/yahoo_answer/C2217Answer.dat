2zA27qmCaa	Well... The effects would override, considering that they both subtract from your opponent's life points when they would gain...     So, no, they would take the normal reversed damage, since the effects are "blanket effects", both setting life point gains to losses as an effect that covers all gains your opponent would get.|`|7Xxvn7GQaa	totally

9VaWal2Daa	a javelin?  for a social studies project you say?????    well, a javelin is usually triangular in shape.....long.......and heavy enough to throw......    all I can picture, is like making a paper plane, and keep folding the paper in upon itself, until it is really skinny.     sorry....that's all I got.     I know a neat trick where you can CUT a single sheet of 8 x10 paper, and make a hole big enough to walk thru!    you can do it with a playing card too , if you are really good with the scissors.     But a javelin.......that's a new one.

jK7pklCKaa	Try open up with Lapras, and use Ice beam  and it should do a a lot of damage to it and would do a decent amount of damage to luxray if he decides to switch to that to take your lapras out.    Generally the key to winning a pokebattle is to predict what hes going to use, since you know what he has you should be able to make a rough decision depending on what each of you has out at the time. Usually if someones pokemon is weak to anothers they will switch it out to something good against the others,|`|9MtL3L6Caa	Hmmm...you didn't really give us much to go off of, but I'll give it a shot. His pokemon could be at higher levels than yours, or have higher speed stats.  You could try to guess what pokemon he's going to send out first and counter that with a pokemon that has type advantages. Or, as soon as he faints Beedril, and Beedril used Sunny Day right before, you could send out Charizard to make his Flamethrower stronger. If Infernape killed Beedril, then I'd send out Lapras. Infernape is a fire/fighting type, and Lapras' psychic would give it a lot of damage.  Sorry I couldn't be more of a help.|`|oUWg7466aa	You need a lot more mudkips man.|`|NRS3vrRSaa	It's obvious. You need more damn mudkips.|`|jq3LdPBKaa	If all same level start with raichu or lapras against honchkrow. For infernape use charizard.

6GIrW5eWaa	There are those type of people out there that will lead you to believe that this can be done, but in fact it cannot be hacked. Most of the times when you hear that someone was hacked it was because they were doing something that they weren't suppose to do. Example if you will humor me for a minute. I was reading on the Halo forum about a person who claimed his account was hacked, he had this big long story about a certain person who he knew for fact that hacked it. What finally came out was that he gave his gamertag and login information to this person under the pretense that they would get his account to a certain level 50 (for a fee of course). Then he kept the account and blocked all communications to him. The shorter version in this is; don't give your information to anyone, period!

This is for an american girl: MATERIALS    ? US Size 6 dpns  ? US Size 8 dpns  ? Crochet hook (for finishing)  ? Leftover worsted weight yarn  I used less than 1/3 a skein of Patons Classic Wool Merino for the entire sweater.   ? Provisional Cast On Color  This yarn is also a worsted weight acrylic yarn in a color so completely opposite from the yarn colors of your sweater so as not to be confused for the actual sweater. This is only a place holder and will be ripped out at various stages of the knitting.  ? Gauge: 5 sts = 1 inch wide and 6 sts = 1 inch tall   NOTE - This sweater is another Knitting From the Top Down Sweater.

Repeat these two rows one more time (28 st).  DO NOT CUT YARN!    Picking Up the Front Shoulder Stitches   Insert the needle from top-to-bottom, right to left and pick up 5 stitches.     Cut off the provisional cast on yarn ONLY above the 5 picked up stitches. Tie a knot in the leftover provisional cast on yarn so that you dont lose the center stitches.    Repeat for the other shoulder.    You should know have 5 stitches on the left needle, 10 stitches in the center still connected to the provisional cast on yarn, and 5 more stitches on the right needle. If you prefer, you can put one of the sides on a stitch holder and work one side at a time.

L6wNnxdfaa	I really don't think there are rated A games out for the PS3....    Why would you want to know anyways?|`|uctxzjIIaa	No. Ao is an ESRB rating, which only applies to North America. The North American arms of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo refuse to licence unrated or Ao-rated games (mainly due to the PR storm that would erupt), and without that licencing, it is illegal to a company to publish a game for their system in the US (thanks to a lawsuit Nintendo won against Tengen back in the NES days).    There's little push from publishers to try to change this either. They can still make Ao-rated PC games, but none bother, since all the major retailers that carry video games refuse to sell Ao games anyway (due to the same PR issues). With that beign the case, it's pretty much impossible to turn a profit in North America on an Ao game.    There are undoubtedly plenty of games in Japan that would get an Ao rating if they tried to release in the US. But since they don't try, they don't actually get rated by the ESRB.|`|raEUval8aa	Umm.....what does that mean? Like rated 10/10? Yes, there are quite a lot actually.      Or are you talking about an age rating? Do you mean AO (Adults Only)?    Then no.|`|YTGDqc77aa	no Dont think so   ive saw GTA san andreas   for PS2 to thats rated A until   the cut out the sex mini game then turned it   to M|`|gPZ7d3mJaa	not yet bro  but you could find out on www.ign.com  it tells u games coming out in da future|`|gzk25Zz4aa	Order form Japan  they got alot of rated  A games.

To see if your state outlaws them, check here:  http://www.skmknives.com/blade.html    For Canada, check here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade    Then, you can find something to suit you at one of these locations:  http://www.bladeplay.com/cat--Home--82  http://www.bladehq.com/cat--All-Items--1  http://www.jaxknives.com/cheapies_auto.h...    Only problem, if you're ordering from outside Canada, you might have a problem getting your knife through customs.  good luck..  :o)|`|bl8co4hUaa	I live in the U.S., and they are illegal in most, if not all, states. Buying one online is risky and potentially illegal.    Go to a local knife shop and inquire. The dealer should be knowledgeable about what blades are permitted because if they're legal, he or she will likely sell them.
o7gckZ2Paa	I think you and i are in the same boat. I'm having trouble with the fair's website as well. Its slow and doesn't always connect.  I also noticed that all of the dates are from last year. It sucks too, cause I scheduled days off based on the (incorrect) days of the armbands so that I could take my 6 year old son. The dates ARE from last year, but as far as the armbands go, I DID find a site that has the right dates. The correct dates are: February 6, 8, 13, 15 and 16. I don't know how much they are.

ZA5QTj3Zaa	http://www.blurtit.com/q453307.html    Try this.  I was just looking up a code for my Sims original.  You click on the link and scroll down, someone wrote a list of many games and the Sims is included, I didn't see if the rest of the expansion packs are there but I will be looking.    i feel for you.  i have all the Sims expansion packs and could not use them for 4 yrs b/c I lost all my codes.  I put the first code in for The Sims and it installed okay, I haven't played it yet, but here is hoping.    Good luck.    PS with all the illegal trading/downloading going on it is stupid that ppl aren't willing to help someone who made a simple mistake and threw out some old papers with codes on them.    EDIT:  It installed and played fine but when I went to save it said it encountered and error and wouldn't save.  Maybe it is just my computer or the code I used.  Hope fully the other ones work.|`|xi9amEG2aa	Each game comes with it's own code.  We can't give you our code...I don't think it would let you install it.

obPSaYf3aa	When I used to crank the ball during my jr. league days through PBA competition, I just kept my wrist cupped all the way from address to release and tucked my pinky finger in.  My backswing was shortened and since I have a swing that comes from the inside, I was able to wind it up a bit and at release, just normally go with a 1/2 way counterclockwise motion (I'm a righty) "through" the ball and generate much needed revolutions and speed because I was much stronger back then.  No extra wrist, hand or finger motions needed.  Just a strong wrist (or assistance with a wrister), the basics of bowling, ability to keep the wrist cupped and an aggressive coverstock bowling ball.    Now, after all those years of trying to make the ball look ominous on the lane, I changed back to a conventional straighter style and delivery.  I guess I was getting fed up with tons of 10 pin leaves, solid 7-10's and deflected splits from cranking the ball once the game started changing with even more aggressive bowling balls.    Well, to each their own, and certified bowling coaches like mine will tell you that you can keep your style, no one can change it, but they are out there to improve your style with the basics of bowling and get rid of the bad habits, much like golf instructors do.  Good luck!|`|VmGrypxVaa	try searching it in Youtube =]|`|AA10462002	Cranking is not the way to go.  Yes, there are some people that bowl very well this way, but I'd stick with what works for you.  Forcing a hook like that puts a lot of strain on your body and can risk injury.  Also, you'll never learn to control it with any consistency.  Those that do bowl like that grew up bowling like that and do it naturally.
AA11850311	Yes, you need Sims2 first before you install Pets.  Sims2 Double Deluxe (includes the base game) is about $20 at Walmart  If you have a friend that will lend you the disk, yes you can do it that way too.  You can borrow Sims2, University, Nightlife, and Open for Business, and still play off the Pets disk.  If you borrow any other games that are newer than Pets, you will need to play with that disk instead.  Make sure that your friend has the manual, you will need to use his installation key, but do not register it!!!  Only register your Pets code.  You will need to register at least one game in order to get the official patches.    Patches that you will need after installing  http://thesims2.ea.com/update/index.php|`|C4N3TM3maa	yes you need the sims 2 and sims 2 pets  but you can either get the sims 2 double deluxe which is 3 games for like $27 (and you will still need the sims pets)  but sims 3 is coming out soon   idk if they're going to have pets in that one|`|Bi7DoB7iaa	u have to buy the sims 2 first, then the sims 2 pets expansion pack.

y02PZj22aa	Yes--start a small business.  Think of yourself as a business person and look for ways you can put your talents to work.  Ideas others have mentioned sound good, and will be even better when you approach them from the "business person/entrepreneur" angle.    1.  Yard sale/Garage sale:  You probably have things you can sell, so a tag sale is a good idea.  A better idea is to canvass your relatives and neighbors to see if THEY have things they'd like to sell.  Offer to sell their things for a commission--you do all the work and advertising and take 50% of whatever the "stuff" sells for (they will have to agree to the lowest price you can negotiate to in a sale, however).  You can be selective of what you do sell--no "junk"--and increase the chances of a profitable tag sale.    2.  Yard Work/Snow Shoveling:  Depending on where you are in the country, now is the time to prune dormant shrubbery, get the last leaves out of the flower beds and renew the mulch, mow the grass, or shovel snow.  Many of those things need to be done by many homeowners at the same time.  You can do only so much--and some of your schoolmates may also want to pick up some quick change.  Organize a group of willing workers you can call on and find out which days and hours they are willing to work and what their skills are.  Decide on the per-hour charge they are willing to take.  Then advertise your service with your phone number in your neighborhood, at church (older people may be your best customers), at the corner store.  Either charge more than you pass on to the workers (you're doing the scheduling, advertising, and dealing with the customers) or take a cut of the workers' pay (10% is probably fair), and schedule workers at times they can provide the needed service.    3.  Same principle with dog walking, baby-sitting, house-sitting, grocery shopping, and other services you perform for a fee.  For these services, you'll need to draw up a contract specifying exactly what each party will expect and what they will provide.  You may also want to get in touch with an insurance company to see what liability insurance will cost you.    Good luck with your entrepreneurial projects!|`|qNkFMv8Naa	Ebay dude. just sell some stuff and you'll be good.|`|3FirTMbtaa	buy stuff and resell it on ebay|`|bSr3WeXNaa	Get a job, and how old are you?

I've made up to $300 in one sale, just depends on what you have.    Used CDs and DVDs sell really well, as do toys, camping equipment, hobby stuff. Clothes do not usually sell well. Try to avoid putting out junk; you can have a freebie junk box for bits of things if you like. CDs and DVDs should be in good condition.    Also, knick-knacks and curios like little porcelain figures and cute or novelty items sell very well. If you're unsure of pricing, ask around at a garage sale some time in your area. Garage sales do best on weekends, like Saturdays.|`|wig4qCeJaa	If you feel comfortable doing this, go door to door and ask for work:    Yard work    Washing cars    Cleaning inside/outside    I never see young people doing this, but would be delighted to employ them.

JWjq5iaXaa	When you turn around 13, then you could get into some business. I sold stuff at school, stuff I made... like duct tape wallets. 9 years old is a little tough to start out on, but no problemo.

mqV9TOv0aa	Hay Nick, the more you can make the wheels spin easy, the better you will do in the race. Some oils in the right place can make a big difference. Depending on the weight of the car, bigger wheels could add more weight and give you an edge, but if you have a low drag axel, there is almost no difference.    ME!    .|`|AA10282820	Take a pencil and scribble in one spot until you get a small amount of graphite to use as a lubricant for the wheel to axle connections.|`|qe1Ncf7Yaa	tie a rope to it and ur car and go on a highway :D|`|CAAcoqtYaa	Give it a nice axle that is smooth to fit with the caps.|`|OUtcHIm0aa	zoom show had this on one time. I think it will go fast if you fart in the opposite direction so it will have a gust of air that will move it faster.|`|T8G0wOXQaa	Take the bottle caps make sure they are the same size.    Try smoothing them out (the ridges)    Make the car heavy, if it is starting on a ramp the more momentum it has the faster it will go.    Good luck|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	make it heavy enough, because it's going downhill.  don't have the wheels wobble.  It will slow it a lot.  Use yogurt lids for wheels (they are more stable than the tops of drinks).  Unless you are talking about the little caps from 2 liter bottles.  good luck|`|9lsSy9m5aa	sdf|`|DBYxsNe2aa	well first you need to make sure that the part of the wheel that attaches to the axle is completely round and not too small. and the outside of the wheel that is kinda bumpy needs to be sanded so its smooth but not too smooth because it won't have any friction. on the paper towel roll needs a little weight in it towards the front so it is forced down the ramp.|`|ZV7kORR7aa	are you talking about mr.mcgreagors in independence middle school class cause im trying to do the same thing

4e7e1ef459ff402fdbafe1fd53ca981aaa	put it this way, if the game is at all hard for you, or you don't want to waste potions/money buying potions, or you like to kill things yourself, i'd recommend using any healer (ie rucha, ayna, michelle, eugene).    if you don't care about any of those things, then put in non healers (sigmund, edward, etc).  and if its any benefit, i found the big hitters didn't hit that big or were too slow that i ended up doing it myself anyway.    personally for me, i preferred healers for ALL the reasons i mentioned above.  i made the mistake of playing a dungeon with sigmund and the tiger - none of us could heal.  and it made it very hard to get thru.

X9kNbpnQaa	No, the Panoramas don't produce the required colored mana.    The Panoramas don't actually produce the colored mana themselves. Instead, they produce one colorless (enough for the "any color", not enough for the blue) and/or can search your library for basic lands and put them into play. They don't have basic land types or tap abilities to generate colored mana, either.    When a card generates mana, it actually uses the mana symbol (the numbers in circles, symbols in the center of the basic lands Forest, Swamp, Plains, Island, Mountain, or hybrid stuff that's a fusion of the two former symbols). They never actually say "forest" or "mountain". This mana is generated from the card and put into your mana pool.

YVfz3KxBaa	They are adding a lot of theme .smoke, on board audio ride triggered lights and other effects.It should be cool at first.

i41wOu48aa	Reputation is very similar to experience. Reputation is divided into a number of different levels for which players must earn reputation points to progress through. Higher reputation levels generally require more points than the previous level to progress. The exception is hated, which spans a very large number of reputation points. Reputation points, just like experience points, are gained through quests and killing various mobs. Unlike experience, it is possible to lose reputation points with some factions, either by killing members of the faction or by assisting rival factions. For rival factions, gaining reputation with one will normally decrease reputation with the other, but at a greater rate. For instance, if you kill a magram centaur, you will gain 20 points of reputation from the gelkis, but will lose 100 points from the magram. Currently there are 4 of these rival-faction pairs: Aldor (Draenei) vs. Scryers (Blood Elves), Gelkis vs. Magram (both Centaur), Steamwheedle Cartel (Goblins) vs. Bloodsail Buccaneers (pirates), and Ravenholdt (rogues) vs. Syndicate (Thugs).|`|iPe9i9tnaa	yea...scoob has got a good knowledge about reputation

Wha1t4Sraa	Fallout 3|`|3Xop7uxaaa	sounds like you're a little too picky.|`|GLIa3Cdtaa	I would say Fallout 3 is the best post apocalyptic game out there. it really is not that unrealistic, yah theres supermutants and giant insects but it explains how they came about, and after a nuclear war there might be animals like that.|`|AA11634780	You might try the Tomb Raider games if you haven't already.  They're not post apocalyptic, but they can give you that desolate feeling.  They're not shooting at zombies either.|`|meySiWKzaa	I think fallout is the closest you'll come to that.  Outside of fallout, there really isnt much that fits all of that.
QWHpXlNCaa	It is one of the minimum paying jobs there. probably at least $9.50<br>  per hour. how you can tell if you are looking for higher rate is the age required for the job. that supervisor position calls for at least 16. if the job calls for at leats 18 then it pays like an ectra $1 an hour. look here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lionsafari.com/jobs.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.lionsafari.com/jobs.asp</a>
MtikeJtRaa	You have a few options here:<br>  <br>  Ignore the turning chain when you reach the end of a row.  A lot of patterns count the turning chain from the previous row as a dc.  You can ignore it by not crocheting into it.  You will need to do something to help you get the height for the next row, so even if you do chain 2 when you start the next row, dc in the same place and count that as your first stitch.<br>  <br>  Instead of chain 2, chain 1 VERY LOOSELY (it will give you a big chain) and dc in the same place.  Ignore the chain when you are going back on the next row.<br>  <br>  You can also try this method:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxYpo-tyi8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxYpo-ty...</a>|`|g7igZ4svaa	This will work on almost anything.  You have already kinda started, but needed to finish.  I have used this on anything that has a solid look to it.  I began doing this when making Barbie clothes so there wouldn't be the gaping hole down the back of the dresses. <br>  <br>  When working in rounds or rows you take one chain away from your turning/beginning chain, then make the your first stitch in the last stitch of the previous row.  This will fill in the gap you have in the beginning of your rows.  (You probably have one gap at each end, right?).  And when you get to the end of your row you will stitch in the normal stitch not the short stitch that you started with.  When you are counting your stitches in each row/round you don't count that one because it's not a full stitch, just a filler so to speak.<br>  <br>  I really hope that made sense to you.  I guess I have done it so much it's one of those things that is easier for me to show than explain.|`|NCq71qptaa	You might also try turning your piece the other way or doing your chain after you turn.  Finally, you can try going through the chain from the other direction (back to front) when you get to the end.
5l5uHNQEaa	yes the "package" is supposed to come with a transmitter, otherwise the controller will not work.  If you got it used (or new for that matter), then return it pronto with the receipt for either your money back, or get them to give you another "package" with the transmitter.<br>  <br>  For swapping transmitters, that's a no-no.  So make sure you always have yours no matter what.
AA12042448	I would suggest making your shirts a little more long-term-usable.  Don't put anything about panthers or the other school's name on them.  Build your own school up without tearing down the other one.<br>  <br>  The school initials on your shirts is a great idea for the front.  For the back, if one or more of you is artistic, draw one big picture of a cougar that stretches across all 4 shirts.  Make sure you get it in the right order, of course, so the letters on the front and the picture on the back both make sense at the same time.  If none of you is that artistically gifted, go with big cougar paw prints.  Those aren't hard at all.

XKiMAh39aa	I Dont agree with what Runespace Pro just said but left 4 dead is intended for online play although its single player is not that good its multiplayer is where it gets its shine<br>  <br>  yeah F.E.A.R 2 is a great game and IT ONLY HAS 10 WEPS NOT 50+<br>  but after you finish it then what?????<br>  <br>  L4D do has some flaws of its own such as repetitive of the map but then every time you play it has diff surprises w8ting 4 u in the next corner or the next room especially when your playing with active players not AIs then it also has diff spots where you can find weps like the TIER 2 weps (the autoshotgun, assault rifle and the hunting rifle) which you cant exchange with your TIER 1 weps which you,ve started with.<br>  <br>  Also L4D will be continue to be updated<br>  <br>  L4D bases on team cooperation while F.E.A.R 2 bases well...... on your gameplay<br>  <br>  I'd say its better 2 buy L4D since the game test your "trust" factor with others (not with AIs dont trust them when you're incap it takes a while  4 them 2 realise that 4 you 2 b revived but stick close 2 them) <br>  <br>  OR if you have enough money then buy both then judge it by yourself.|`|056440fa395da52240b41fd2644a15bcaa	All I know is that Left 4 Dead is excellent! It has a great coop play mode, a fresh style of online play, an above average single player story mode and it will receive lots of DLC for it in the future. The single player story mode isnt anything spectacular but the game really shines online. There will be new weapons , maps and customizable characters released in the near future according to Doug Lombardi which is Valve's VP of Marketing. If you want a game that will have great replay value with new content being distributed GET LEFT 4 DEAD! <br>  <br>  F.E.A.R 2 is also a great game with lots of choices in weapons and other story content, but doesn't have nearly the replay value of Left 4 Dead and will no way even compare to Left 4 Dead with DLC and new content being produced.|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	i bought "left 4 Dead" a couple of months ago but its simply not made out what its said to be. Threw out the WHOLE GAME you can only use 5 weapons compared to 50+ weps on Fear 2, the graphics arent that good on left 4 dead. L4D simply repeats itself with the same monsters all the time and the same weapons! all you can get is a pistol shotgun and uzi and another on i cant think of right now. If your looking for a good scare and basically a good game you need to lean towards Fear!<br>  <br>  My Rating:<br>  Left 4 DEAD 2/5 NO  GOOD WEPS SAME MONSTERS REPEATS <br>  ITSELF<br>  <br>  <br>  FEAR IS THE WAY TO GO|`|8ScvPsTAaa	I can't really choose. Though, as much as I love F.E.A.R., Left 4 dead is probably a better buy. FEAR 2 is a really good game. The fighting is realistic and is always fun. There are a bunch of weapons but not THAT many. I dont know why that guy said 50+ weapons. Theres only like 10. <br>  <br>  The reason I say Left 4 Dead because it will have you playing it for a while. FEAR 2 is a pretty short game. I beat it in 2 days (though it was probably cause i never stopped playing it :-)) but the multiplayer will not keep you playing it. The mulitplayer is fun but it gets boring after a while. Left 4 Dead is meant for online gameplay, so theres no limit to it. You can play as many times as you want and you probably always see something new. Once prices on the games go down though, get FEAR 2 AS SOON AS YOU CAN!
J0p6r3r0aa	its gay dont get it|`|YVX59Rd1aa	Its is an RTS game. Real time strategy its not first-person shooter like halo, call of duty, ect. It is a fun game if you like planning moves that you want to see happen. The difficulty isnt too hard so if you pick it up you should get the hang of it. It is a really simple game. Plus it has fun 1 player vs. 1 A.I. skirmish mode. So I reccomend it to fans of the series and casual rts fans. I like it and I like Halo 3 and Call of Duty so you should give it a rent and try it out first.|`|nZynoCVKaa	better

It could also be other things to such as your fans not turning on....
zSvcfC8Faa	one of my favorite games from gym class was called turkey shoot.  Everyone got a pin and placed it on one of the lines anywhere in the gym.  Then everyone was given a ball.  When the teacher blew the whistle, you would try to knock other peoples pins over with the balls while protecting your own pin.  The last person with their pin still up was the winner.  <br>  <br>  Another way to play was to have a few people sit out to begin and when someone's pin was knocked over, they would give it to the first person in line who wasn't in the game.  This way, the game can go on for as long as you want and there are no "winners" or "losers".

uctxzjIIaa	Both Factions and Nightfall have their own continent (Factions is far east Asia themed, while Nightfall is Middle East themed), and Eye to the North opened up new areas of Tyria. Factions adds the Assassin (close-quarters spike damage and condition/hex machine with weak armor) and Ritualist (blend of Healing Monk, Air Elementalist, and nature spirit-focused Ranger) classes, while Nightfall adds the Paragon and Dervish classes (I never bought Nightfall or played much after it's release, so I don't know about them). Both Factions and Nightfall have new skills for the 6 original classes, though some of them are just existing skills with new names (though this does let you have multiple copies of those skills in your skill bar, essentially).<br>  <br>  If you have multiple parts of Guild Wars all on a single account, you can have your characters travel between the continents and gain skills/armor not available where they started.<br>  <br>  From what I understand, Eye to the North did not add any new skills, but it did give alternate locations to capture 15-20 Elite skills for each class, and added some new Green equipment that was better than anything else you could possibly get by a little bit.|`|4lASyV9yaa	yes, eotn(eye of the north) is a expansion and is for more skills and rewards<br>  faction is for the two new proffesions:assasin and ritualist<br>  and nightfall is for the two more new profesions:dervish and paragon<br>  all three of these add more skills and new heros<br>  *source*:IVE BEATEN THE GAME AND I HAVE ALL THREE CAMPAIGNS+EXPANSION listin from a  pro XD
dLsx3fKuaa	Granite is better than rune,  but a hell of a lot more heavier. I would recommend granite above rune (even though the legs are a little pricey)<br>  <br>  You might want to look into getting some sacred armor from stealing creation. It's about as good as rune, but it's more combat efficient because of it's compatibility.|`|3nCA4768aa	Granite is better Rune.I would reccomend you use Rune and spend the money you save on 60 Defence. then buy yourselfe some nice Dragon armour. The best armour is the ones with good strength bonuses. A good defence is an even better aufence, always remember that in Runescape. Granite also will make going places a pain, you will have no run in 1minute. Combine your rune armour with climbing or rune boots, also a strength or glory ammulet wont kill anyone. Try and go for a defender, and a fighter torso these will raise your strength drasticly and make you hit alot harder. If you feel up to it then try your hand at fremminik isles and score a helm of neitiznot this is also great defence and killer strength bonus.<br>  <br>  add me my name is slur11 for anymore questions.|`|9WfLBpWkaa	well granite is better than rune but will greatly reduce your run energy faster. also depending on if you are a member or not there are also more armours that give bonuses in a specific feild rather than just defence.|`|svtJUrcUaa	well ,if ur talking about armor, then all we need to know if just defence. i would go with rune, or i forget when you can wear dragon

You'll get maybe 40-50 dollars if your lucky. If you sell it on craigslist or ebay you will get almost double that. A new Xbox360 is anywhere from $199.99 up to $399.99. You can do the math with that.|`|9DBV1CZ8aa	No one is going to exchange a 360 for a ps2. The system is over 7 years old. It's practically worthless.

WUQ9dNVbaa	My favorite game. The Star Levels are a bit tricky, but to pass them and keep going you need to pass it by looking for keys and you know, taking them to the keyhole. I don't how different the GBA version of the game is, but the levels to secret levels are Chocolate Island 2, to get the secret key in the level you have to pass the scene with the flying koopas before 260 seconds, if the timer hits 259 before you get to the second pipe it wont work.

16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Um, the order of the pieces is different from what you said, but other wise the same. Any piece except a king.  (Pawns are not pieces, blame guys in the middle ages for that distinction.:))|`|UVUYG5jaaa	in most cases the queen is the best choice, you can also select a rook or a knight...... (a bishop is basically a useless choice). the rook can prevent a stalemate by giving you an extra square to move to. a knight is even rarer but usefull if it gives you check...some of the nicer sets have an extra queen, but your allowed to use an upside down rook if necassary|`|AA10248312	When a pawn reaches the last rank (row) on the board  (i.e. when a White pawn reaches the 8th rank or a Black pawn reaches the first rank), it must be exchanged for any piece of its own color, except a King.<br>  <br>  So you may exchange the pawn for either a Queen, a Rook, a Bishop, or a  Knight of your own color.<br>  <br>  The pawn can not remain a pawn once it reaches the final rank, it must be promoted immediately before your opponent has to move.<br>  <br>  It's always best to choose a Queen, of course, except for two instances:<br>  <br>  1) If promoting the pawn to a Queen will lead to an immediate stalemate position for your opponent, when you have an advantage in material, you should promote to a lesser piece.  The last thing you want to do is promote to a Queen only to have the game end in a draw with a stalemate, when you have a material advantage.<br>  <br>  2) On occasion, it's preferable to promote to a Knight if the promotion produces an immedate Knight fork that will swing the game to your advantage.<br>  <br>  But you read it right.|`|UpmdLqYnaa	As long as a pawn has made it to the complete opposite side of the board (the 8th rank for white, the 1st rank for black), then you have the option to change your pawn into any piece other than a pawn or a king.|`|hK9klgvVaa	it is your choice to either select a queen, rook, knight, bishop upon promoting a pawn to the 8th rank.  And any subsequent pawns as well.<br>  Good luck with your games.

It was implemented as a protective measure against bots that use a page refresher.<br>  <br>  If you were banned the best thing to do would be to contact Gaia explaining the issue and hope that they unblock your IP address.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do to prevent this is to view pages slower. Don't just go on a clicking rampage (not saying that you were). Just give a page time to load entirely and wait a short amount of time between each page view and what not.<br>  <br>  If this appeared within the last week or so it could be a glitch.

(By this way I'm assuming that you haven't tried the Add and Remove programs and are running a Windows computer) Click on your start button, then settings, and then click Control Panel. Once it opens up, click on the program addressed as Add and Remove Programs. Scroll down the list until you come across World of Warcraft. Click Change/Remove and it will start to erase the files. If this fails, then read the second option. First, go to your Windows Explorer. Navigate to your WoW folder located in C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft. All you have to do from here is erase the entire folder, and erase the desktop shortcut.
6GIrW5eWaa	speculation only but if you go to www.bungie.com and read some of the release information you can guess a little right? In the release it states while those of you who have purchased the limited edition halo wars are enjoying the new maps we ask those who are purchasing on the market place to be patient. So for the next 5 weeks they are going to provide everyone else information about the maps and the different variants of the maps. This is just an overview not word for word of what it said. So if you take that to the letter they will be on the market place on 4/7/2009. Now if you believe all the 7 stuff with bungie 7 on 7 and the 7 original founders of bungie and how 7 always comes up it sort of makes sense.

Defense, and Speed and Lapras has better Hp, Defense, and Sp. Defense. They both (R & j) have the same growth curve of 1,000,000 which is Normal. Gyarados and lapras both have they same also but they have tough which is 1,250,000.

I would pick Jolteon and Larpras.|`|7nTOHsGKaa	Jolteon and Raichu are really just who you like best. There isn't really a difference. As for Gyarados and Lapras, It all depends on the type you like best. Gyarados can learn more dragon attacks, but Lapras can learn more Ice attacks.

Clerics are a big hit because they don't require a lot of mesos since they can heal themselves = don't have to buy HP pots. And with mp eater they can cut down mesos from MP pots as well. Plus they are popular in PQs and parties. In addition to that, they have a bunch of moves that ups your defense/attack like bless, invincible, holy symbol(doubles your exp :D), etc. However, they don't do that much damage. <br>  Assassins spend a lot of money compared to other classes because they use a lot of MP pots, but not that much HP pots. Plus they need to recharge their stars. However, they are pretty strong and fun because when they get to third job they have flash jump :D|`|ER3DRi1Raa	Well, personally, I enjoy playing as a warrior. At first it may seem like a challenge and that no one wants you because of your acc, but later on, you'll get more wanted. It's a nice challenge to be a warrior, which is one reason why I like it so much. Don't pick a magician or a thief, so many people pick those. Besides, the skills are pretty neat in my opinion (Fighter and Spearman.) If you don't like warriors, at least make a brawler. I'm not a specialty in that area, but I do have a... I believe it is a lv. 34. Nice skills also, great attack.

AA11030557	A used DS and games probably will not sell for the original price, especially if you market it as "crappy."  You might get $70 or $80 for it, leaving about $100 for your allowance to cover--five months if you spend it on nothing else.<br>  I suggest you try to save your money (allowance, resale, whatever) and buy yourself a new PSP sometime in the future.  Once you have one, take steps to avoid losing it again.  You could also try to learn to enjoy the DS and discover the many good games that are available for it.  Try asking a question for game suggestions.<br>  Otherwise, you could try to find something else to satisfy your great need for entertainment, perhaps something that you can afford and earn yourself.|`|nnziVe4zaa	You probably wont get as much as you spent back, unless everything is unopened. Sell your DS on ebay, you might be able to get a little more for it then the game stores would give you.|`|1Uk6j3Ccaa	I have many situations like yours before, heres what I would do. Do some research on what places would buy the DS and how much would you receive along with other accessories and games you don't want to up the return value. <br>  <br>  Then after you let your dad know where he could trade it in for some cash or credit you can add on other things to make up for the remaining balance or make him want to get you a PSP, like doing chores for a week, reducing or not give you allowance for a month or two, etc.<br>  <br>  Make it as easy for him and dont give him a reason to say no.|`|iVFR6Rzaaa	well if you give him your DS and games to sell would that be enough?
cKzP0wI2aa	If your that high of a combat level I would highly recomend getting big bones from moss giants or hill giants, wichever you prefer. You could also go to the wild, there are plenty of bones lying around there. Or look for quests that give you prayer exp for a reward.|`|0KpHYUZBaa	Unfortunately its not the quickest level to up...<br>  I recommend just powing around Lumbridge and picking up bones that other people left. Just keep picking them up until you have a full inventory, and then bury them to empty your inv, and continue.<br>  The reason that I say get the bones that are just lying around is so that you don't have to waste time killing anything or waste money buying them.<br>  :]|`|vd1pnMZyaa	go to a pvp world and when other people kill eachthother they dont take the bones so get the bones and, run in any safe spot and bury.

I would say get you r prayer to 50 which is pretty decent or atleast to the point you can use melee protect. <br>              if you have any plans to get memership wait out on prayer. In members you can use ectofuntus after ghost ahoy. which is very fast and effective method to level prayer apart from pest control and soul wars.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck <br>  pc|`|6ac89f4c5c098186328d1b26a2cbdee9aa	I'd say buy big bones and bury them.  Very fast XP there.<br>  <br>  Too expensive you say?  Probably so.  Prayer is THE MOST expensive non-member skill to train quickly (by a big margin).<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to buy bones, you should fight Hill Giants or Moss Giants and bury the big bones they drop.  <br>  <br>  If that's too slow for you, try going somewhere like the minotaurs in the Stronghold of Security.  They are very low level, so you can kill a lot of them quickly.  And most folks leave the bones on the ground, so you can gather up those bones and bury them.<br>  <br>  If you want to get your prayer much higher than 50, you should pay to be a member.  They have MUCH faster and cheaper ways to train prayer.  And I think the highest non-member prayer is like lvl 45.
gfmTgLDKaa	Yes, you'd have to go in the bed with a guy that has fallen in love with you. Sometimes you don't get pregnant right away, you have to try multiple times with protection off.

cLW7vFUGaa	Yep, I like Harvest Moon! Haha, you're right; it's hard to believe how a game about work and real life is so incredibly appealing.<br>  <br>  My first Harvest Moon game and major obsession was Magical Melody, for GameCube. I had also rented Another Wonderful Life, the girl version of A Wonderful Life for GameCube, but didn't like it too much - first of all because of the limited number of potential bachelors, and second of all because I've got ridiculously high standards in my preference for cutesy-ness and brightness in video game graphics, and Magical Melody was the one to deliver. I loved the huge cast of characters and Musical Note collecting subplot, and set myself to recording over two hundred cutscenes and related videos from the game on YouTube. Yeah, that's pretty obsessed. And I'm still working on the collection.<br>  <br>  Because of that major obsession factor, I was determined to stick to only one real game from the series, not wanting something else to take over my life. I was excited to play Puzzle de Harvest Moon, which was fun but thankfully not quite as addicting as the entire life-sim ones.<br>  <br>  But then, a couple of months ago, I finally got Tree of Tranquility for Wii. And it. Is. Awesome. I have to say it's my new favorite. The selection of marriage candidates for each gender is wonderful, and the relationships are much more developed through heart events and festivals. The plot is also very interactive with the main ranching storyline and very fun to play through.<br>  <br>  So, um, very sorry for rambling - short answer to the actual question: Me, and Tree of Tranquility! ^^|`|a395f8e196fb55bd41bce52e9a5c7699aa	i never played those before.  but i guess it's an ok game <br>  <br>  =)|`|v72gVgtsaa	I liked the old 64 version myself.

B9gBsCGGaa	It's not your GPU, I have an Geforce9800 and it works fine with me, check your RAM and your processor. The game's minimum RAM requirements are 2GB, this does'nt mean to say that 2GB will run it perfectly. I would say between 4-6 GB RAM would work it perfectly. Check how much RAM you have.|`|OpO5tcNLaa	Your computer should easily run it. I ran the demo on my 512mb Geforce 8600M GS (rather poorly i might add). The full game is probably more optimized so you should be able to play it. I also ran it on my aging single core processor with a geforce 7800GS (256mb) and it ran better than the other card. Creative Assembly clearly botched the optimization process for this game...and the game doesnt even look that great even on higher settings. To be honest...it looks pretty shoddy for the performance or lack thereof...For a huge FPS boost, turn grass off or lower...trust me it works wonders. But why they would have such poorly implemented grass is beyond me. Also try vsync and tripple buffering to increase your frames. As for the settings not going past medium...i believe it is because they want you to have Vista for the higher settings. My XP machine does not let me go higher than medium but my Vista machine can go to ultra. Best bet is to await the numerous hotfixes and patches that will be released pretty soon due to the issues people have been having. As for the graphics...if you want to crank them up, find a hack for it or try and force it in the configuration files. Check the TW forums for crash fixes or information. I hope i at least gave some insight, though there is not much i can do to really help. Just bide your time, im sure things will get sorted.|`|gfmTgLDKaa	The minimum requirement is 2.4ghz processor and 256 mb for your video card.. If you don't have that, don't bother with even low settings, you need to have like 2.8 ghz processor and more than 512mb graphic card to even play it good. To play it on the best setting, dam you just gotta have like a 10,000 dollar computer bro.|`|lAECuayzaa	Try changing the resolution it seems to help|`|mObKRVqZaa	i to have empire and i can play Medieval 2 on high but not empire on low wtf.|`|qk7xY7iyaa	maybe ur computer doesnt have a high flash.|`|eNMRIKL6aa	Games depend mostly on the video card. Your card is marginal at best for playing games, even though your laptop was billed as a "gaming laptop." The 8000 series nvidia cards came out over 4 years ago, and yours is a mid-level one in that generation. I have a 9800gtx card, and it can handle everything up to ultra settings. I also have a budget level core2 duo processor and 4GB ddr2 ram. RTS games have a lot of threads going and will make good use of dual core or quad core processors.|`|SOxzD2Waaa	i think this game requires a really good video card. what card do u have?<br>  <br>  No wonder because that card isn't the best.

Ambipom first, flinches with fake out. Once thats done I will either u-turn my way out or keep fighting. Brick break is for those annoying steel types and Aerial Aceis for coverage against those nasty grass,bug and to help fight off ghost types. Ambipom is a big annoyer in my team.<br>  <br>  * Might have problems with gengar leads. They usually will hypnosis so you should get someone to absorb the sleep or, then again, let ambipom do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Special Wall<br>  <br>  <br>  Slowking (Zero) w/ Leftovers<br>  Nature: calm<br>  Ability: Own Tempo<br>  Evs: 200 HP/ 56 SpA/ 252 SpD<br>  Moveset:<br>  Surf<br>  Ice Beam<br>  Thunderwave<br>  Slack Off<br>  <br>  My special wall. Own tempo is so I don't get confused. I gave it 200 Hp so it can survive hits from more physical pokemon. 56 SpA so it can still pack a decent punch. He is also my SpA Salamence counter. Surf is for stab and Ice Beam is for coverage. Thunderwave is there for obvious reasons and because I felt my team needed it. Slack off is abviously for HP reasons. Yes, I know he's in uu but he still makes for an effective wall.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Haven't had much experience with slowking tbh. IMO you can drop the Special Attack ev's and pour it all into HP. (Assuming perfect Iv's) Slowking reaches 236 SpA which is enough to OHKO  4HP, 0SpD Salamence. The only reason why the extra ev's would be needed would be for OHKO Garchomp which has been exiled from OU.<br>  <br>  The Defensive Tank<br>  <br>  <br>  Gliscor (Scar) w/ Leftovers<br>  Adamant<br>  Hyper Cutter<br>  252 HP/ 40 Def/ 216 Spe<br>  Moveset:<br>  Ice Fang<br>  Earthquake<br>  Roost<br>  Stealth Rock<br>  <br>  Ok, so this moveset allows me to switch on someone who wouldn't be to good against it, stealth rock on the switch and just go from there. The perfect counter for some ou pokemon like sala,tyranitar, and dragonite. Roost is for hp reasons.Also Fire fang can be used for Skarmory because I have been having some troubles with him lately. The evs allow gliscore to survive any big physical hit that comes its way. His Speed evs allow it to outrun pokemon troubling pokemon such as a nuetral speed Lucario. I have also been having trouble with Heatran lately and this set allows it to easily outrun a Heatran<br>  <br>  *Guuuuuuuuud. It's attacks are walled against some other pokes such as levitate bronzong who could wall you and set up stealth rock itself. <br>  <br>  Physical Beast of Nature<br>  <br>  <br>  Scizor (Rezon) w/ Life Orb<br>  Nature: Jolly<br>  Ability: Technician<br>  Evs: 252 Atk/ 252 Spe/ 6 Def<br>  Moveset:<br>  Swords Dance<br>  Bullet Punch<br>  X-Scissor<br>  Brick Break<br>  <br>  My favorite pokemon. Scizor is one of my main strikers. Jolly nature helps with the speed. I didn't choose adamant because of swords dance. Once swords dance + Technician make bullet punch have a big hit on pokemon. X-Scissor is there for stab and Brick breakk is there for coverage. I usually send him out a little later in the game to help finish off some of the already damaged pokemon. i was also thinking of Roost to help heal life orb damage<br>  The Evil and Deadly Ghost<br>  <br>  * I WOULD STRONGLY suggest you make your scizor adamant. Jolly isn't really needed as scizor is attacking from it's priority bullet punch most of the time. Thus speed is a non-issue. Also, the difference between Jolly and Adamant is huge, especially since you have swords dance AND life orb. Your total net amount of points also increase with an adamant nature. For example, with life orb the difference in attack between neutral and beneficial nature is from 468 to 512. (Around 40 points). After a swords dance, the difference is even more dramatic: 936 to 1024 points: Almost a 100 point difference! <br>  <br>  <br>  Gengar (Boo) w/ Wide Lens<br>  Nature: Timid<br>  Ability: Levitate<br>  Evs: 252 SpA/ 252 Spe/ 6 HP<br>  Moveset:<br>  Hynosis<br>  Thunderbolt<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Focus Blast<br>  <br>  Yes, the basic Gengar set. I chose Wide Lens because it'll help with the poor accuracy of hynosis and focus blast. Gengar pretty much covers all the types it needs to. Not much else to really say here...<br>  <br>  * - You should consider making gengar  a trick-specs. Your brelloom already has spore (a superior sleeping move) and if you already put one of your opponents to sleep, you're not allowed to use hypnosis OR spore (making breloom alot less useful). (This is if your playing by sleep clause and you can only put 1 of your opponent's pokemon to sleep. Almost all competitive players use it, but u probably already knew that. ;D ).  So a set better for your team will be: <br>  <br>  Gengar (Boo) w/ Choice Specs<br>  Nature: Timid / Modest<br>  Ability: Levitate<br>  Evs: 252 SpA/ 252 Spe/ 6 HP<br>  Moveset:<br>  Trick<br>  Thunderbolt<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Focus Blast<br>  <br>  It works like trick-alakazam: You use that massive special attack to destroy everything, come in on immunities. If your opponent sends in|`|xFeGxPtoaa	Seems pretty bad *** dude.|`|lQZa74mIaa	On a scale 1 to 10 i 'd give it a 9.<br>  <br>  Teams good i would battle but don't have wifi.
8pIGQdybaa	The only postage stamps I know of that are free through the mail are sets of collector's stamps.

My mother belonged to several stamp clubs like that.<br>  <br>  I really don't know of any way to get postage for your mailing and SASE other than buying 1st class stamps. If you can't get to a post office, some grocery stores and convenience stores have stamps for sale.
q6uyloYdaa	This happened to me too. You can either kill everyone (which would be hard so early in the game) or start from a previous save. Since you aren't too far in the game, if you don't have a previous save, completely starting over won't be as bad as it could be. I could not find any way to get the people of Megaton to stop trying to kill me so I just went back to an earlier save.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Restart or leave the city and wait a few days in gametime.

However, that Pokemon Yellow is worth something, I would try selling it on ebay.
ZQTgxlzwaa	kind of, the higher the line you put them on, the more play time they'll get and the more you'll have them on the ice, so i suggest putting your best players on the 1st line, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th. Also, players do best when you keep them at there regular position, so try not to mix positions too much.

Join Wow.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely have to join a private WoW server so that you can enjoy WoW to its fullest while not having to pay a cent.

If you're going to choose, the choice would be between Call of duty 4 not call of duty 5 and in those regards i'd say go for Halo 3. Because a lot of people like COD 4 better there will be a split in the COD community because some will play 4 and some will play 5.

c98282119d9626fa0bd7ccc95590b8c3aa	For general help, see the Poptropica Guide (related link below): <br>  <br>  All right, here is a complete walk through of Big Nate island in Poptropica. (see related questions for help) <br>  <br>  <br>  1. First get the top of the Comic page from the guy at Klassic Komix. Collect the 8 missing pieces from around the island : there's two in the school, one atop the school by the cement scaffold, one at the top of the lighthouse, one above the playground, one in the Pop-In shop, one in the photo place, and one on the electric poles (right side of the wire). <br>  <br>  2. Once you have successfully found all of the comic pieces (there are 8), assemble them and go back to Klassic Komix and give them to the guy . He will give you some gum. <br>  <br>  3. The combo on the comic is 9 3 0 5. Go to the school and up to the second floor where you should find a stuffed messy locker. Open it up with the combo. Find the blueprints inside. <br>  <br>  4. Go inside the science lab where there are three chemicals on the counter. Mix the yellow and blue and heat to level 3, and you make a stink bomb. Go back downstairs by the detention room and chew your gum. A teacher will take you inside the detention room where you can set off the stink bomb. Click on the filing cabinet once the teacher leaves the room and go down the ladder. You will have to find the light (power) switch which is down and to your left - the blue hand will appear. There will be a swinging thing (the clapper of the school bell on the top of the school). Before you can repair the bell, you have to get rid of a seagull that keeps knocking you away. <br>  <br>  5. Go to the lighthouse which is as far as you can go to the right of the island. You can climb up the little metal tongs on the side. There is a floating piece of paper to the left of the lighthouse which you have to jump off and hit as you go down. You will automatically pick it up. It is an old photo. <br>  <br>  6. Bring the picture back to the photo shop and give it to the man there, who will give you scuba gear as a trade. <br>  <br>  7. Go back to the lighthouse, put on the scuba stuff, and go dive in the water. (You can aim your mouse down and click 'dive'. Go to the bottom of the water towards the right of the screen quickly and try not to get forced up by the air bubbles.) There is a long rope attached to a rock and a lobster trap next to it. <br>  <br>  8. Go up. To do this just click 'up' where you dove in. Give the lobster trap to the old sailor (Cap'n Salty) who in return will give you a lobster and jet ski keys. <br>  <br>  9. Go to the top of the lighthouse. Use the lobster as pliers to turn the light*. The seagull will go away so you can fix the bell on top of the school. (Ringing the bell will cause schoolgirls sitting on the ground to move. See step 11 below.) <br>  <br>  10. After that you can go back to the lighthouse and ride the jetski with the keys the captain gave you. You have to beat Nate to the island. On the island push both seals to the far left of the seesaw rock. Go under the rock and get the map. Return to the main island. <br>  <br>  11. In the "Kids Only" house on top of the playground, challenge Nate to a game of Hangman. Once you win, he'll give you some crackers. Place a cracker on the ground where the schoolgirls were. The lost dog will dig holes until you find the capsule. Click on the box and pull it out, and click on the gold button. Once it's done loading, Big Nate will be a hero and you'll get your medallion. <br>  <br>  *Note that the lobster (after using it to change the direction of the light) will return to your inventory, as will any item you use (except the stink bomb).

Not only can you play PS3/PS2/PS1 games. But, it acts almost like a computer does. It plays all kinds of media. CD-ROM, DVD, MP3, WMA, ATRAC, and virtually anything else that you can put on a CD or DVD, besides your protected iTunes songs and such. In addition to this, you get an all-in-one media card reader. This comes in handy when your adding media to your PS3 via Memory Stick or Compact Flash. This system also flaunts an extremely high powered processor. It has an octa-core processor. It has 8 processors in it. This is better than most desktops of today. To futher expand your PS3, you can easily switch your PS3 over to another OS. And, you can switch back over to the original OS without any difficultly. Also, you can go onto the Internet using the 802.11b/g wireless card in it. ONE WARNING THOUGH: If you do decide on purchasing a new PS3, try to find a 60GB version. This is the ONLY PS3 that was fully compatible with all previous PS2/PS1 games. But, if you don't plan on playing any PS2 or PS1 games, then I would say to go out and buy a PS3 system tonight.|`|7xJpfheZaa	Ps3 has...<br>  - the best graphics.<br>  - no 3rl<br>  - blu-ray (the cheapest player in the market)<br>  - it plans to have 3d features in the next years<br>  - you can use any bluetooth devices<br>  - free online gaming<br>  - if you have an HDTV and a home theater, you'll be making the most out of it<br>  - Since they are still making games for ps2, the lifespan of it can last you up to 5-7 more years (probably more)<br>  - if you like how the games look now, guess what, it still hasn't used half of it's power. there's too much potential.<br>  - after you buy it, you'll feel that you made good choice (rather than getting a 360)<br>  <br>  is that enough reason?|`|iMDUdcR5aa	well the ps3 has a blu ray player and its internet is pretty fast too i have one and mine is the 60gb model i got it the 2nd day it came out and its still perfectly fine :]|`|CJvq5rh7aa	Besides the games eh??<br>  <br>  HD DVD's..<br>  <br>  If you have one of those Wireless I-Net usb cards you can hook it up and stream movies from your computer to your ps3.. lots of goodies!|`|LxGf6AuQaa	to tell u tha truth u dont really need all that memory<br>  just stick with a 360|`|v6S44idOaa	Blue Ray player.

Also there is a thing which has different options with like 1600x800 and change that to the highest setting- I have forgotten the numbers.

It took me forever to figure that one out!<br>  <br>  Go into options (the 3 dots at the bottom left) and click Graphical/Performance Options (the pic of a computer screen). Then switch Texture Detail to High. That's the only one that affects those details, so don't turn everything up, or else your game will be ridiculously slow unless you have a powerful computer. <br>  <br>  Turning up Texture Detail affects the appearance of everything: hair, clothes, furnishings wall coverings, ect. so turning up just this one can take a toll on game performance. <br>  <br>  You should play around with the Graphic Settings and find which combination of settings works best for your computer and looks best to you.|`|ZZqUkH5aaa	On game settings set it to high qualtiy and it should b good<br>  o and settigns is on the menu where u exit...it looks like turning gears :)

Any will do, It dosnt matter much for your sex appeal or any of that, but the less damaged your car is the better. Anyway drive up near a woman wearing high boots. tiny skirt and a bellyshirt and honk your horn twice. Accept the question and she will get inside. drive to a dark secluded place where u cant be seen and she will " help " you. having sex gives you HP. Now after she is done get out and kill her to get your money back|`|30591Ebkaa	Just go around a prostitute in road or anyway.

lAECuayzaa	I had this problem last night<br>  Uninstall Steam from your PC go into the C drive delete the Steam file and make sure that is not showing on your program list.<br>  Go to task manager make sure steam is not running as has been removed.<br>  Reinstall and should work ok<br>  Another tip if the game wont run some times from clicking the desktop shortcut go to task manager close Steam and try again....runs every time.<br>  The game itself is great but a bit buggy and i am getting some random CTD but hopefully a patch will sort it soon.<br>  <br>  Have fun|`|FfLsQ97Qaa	I had the same problem when trying to install the Special Forces Edition - when Steam asks you to enter the 25 digit authentication key code you have to enter the one printed on the back of the manual - not the one printed on the leaflet titled Special Forces Units.  The key code printed on this leaflet is so that you can access your additional units, not activate the game.  Annoyingly if you enter this code rather than the one on the manual the TWE installer simply runs as normal until it tries to access your DVD drive at which point it returns the ambiguous message 'The Steam servers are too busy to handle your request.  Please try again in a few minutes.'   I wasted a couple of hours following that advice before looking through the box and finding the 2nd keycode.
gTPjvnp4aa	Everyone will tell you the same thing; It all depends on what you like and your play-style. Do some research look on worldofwarcraft.com or thottbot.com for classes/races and their talent trees.<br>  <br>  Mages- Insane magic DPS<br>  Warlocks- Damage over time (DoT) spells<br>  Priests- Great heals, life/spirit buffs and damage absorbing buffs<br>  Warrior- Pure melee/close-range DPS, can tank<br>  Druid- Shapeshifter. Strong character, but hard to stick with. Can magic DPS, melee/close-range DPS, close-range DPS specifically and Heal over time spells (HoT)<br>  Hunter- Strong character able to have a pet at level 10, easiest to solo level with in my opinion. Like having two people.<br>  Shaman- Similar to druid but no shapeshifting. Shamans get VERY helpful totems instead (Very desirable in a group) in my opinion<br>  Paladin- Very versatile character, able to melee/close-range DPS and heal itself and others, Healing specialization, tanking specialization. (Second easiest class to solo level with) in my opinion<br>  Rouge- Haven't played rouge much. They can stealth (basically go invisible) Good DPS.. pure close-range DPS not much versatility.<br>  <br>  Sorry if I missed one.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!

To play Pets on Vista you need a proper dedicated card: <br>  ATI Radeon(TM) series- 9600 or greater required for Vista<br>  Nvidia GeForce -6200 or greater required for Vista<br>  <br>  If you do have ATI Radeon X1200 graphics maybe you can get your money back and purchase one of the laptop friendly games like Sims 2 Life Stories, Castaway Stories etc which are designed for machines with integrated and low-end graphics.|`|v8RBzhVnaa	I had that same problem i work with computer you should delete  it re-download it

If you train by my nature, and let the Pokemon hold that item, then this Pokemon I gave listed, along with the move, guarentees to hit Super Effective, and should OHKO. I beat the Elite 4 with this team, and the entire time the opponent failed to kill any as I 1 hit KO every single one of them (besides Spiritomb). They did made some attacks when I was using things like Sword Dance, but barely did any damage. The move I gave you guarentees good damage AND hits hard and high, if you train right. Remember, Azelf's Explosion is when desperate. It is a safe move to keep as it can kill almost any non-Ghost or Steel Pokemon in game if not EV'd defensively.<br>  <br>  Then, let's take a look at the coverage...<br>  1) Aaron<br>  * Dustox - Fire Blast (Infernape)<br>  * Heracross - Fire Blast (Infernape/Azelf), Psychic (Azelf)<br>  * Vespiquen - Fire Blast (Infernape), Ice Beam (Milotic), Ice Fang or Stone Edge (Gyarados), ThunderPunch (Infernape)<br>  * Beautifly - Fire Blast (Infernape), Ice Beam (Milotic), Ice Fang or Stone Edge (Gyarados), ThunderPunch (Infernape)<br>  * Drapion - Earthquake (Gyarados), Earthquake (Garchomp)<br>  <br>  2) Bertha<br>  * Quagsire - Grass Knot (Infernape), or just wear it down with Milotic's Surf. This is also a good chance to give in a Dragon Dance or 2 on Gyarados, then once that's done, Waterfall kills the rest of his team. Quagsire is weak, and Gyarados is immune to Quagsire's Dig.<br>  * Hippowdon - Waterfall (Gyarados), Surf (Milotic)<br>  * Sudowoodo - Close Combat (Infernape), Surf (Milotic), Waterfall (Gyarados). Milotic's Surf works the best.<br>  * Golem - Grass Knot (Infernape), Surf (Milotic)<br>  * Whiscash - Grass Knot (Infernape)<br>  <br>  3) Flint<br>  * Rapidash - Earthquake (Gyarados), Waterfall (Gyarados), Surf (Milotic)<br>  * Infernape - Psychic (Azelf), Earthquake (Garchomp)<br>  * Lopunny - Close Combat (Infernape)<br>  * Steelix - Fire Blast (Infernape)<br>  * Drifblim - Thunderbolt (Azelf) or Ice Beam (Milotic)<br>  <br>  4) Lucian<br>  * Mr. Mime - Night Slash (Weavile)<br>  * Girafarig - Night Slash (Weavile)<br>  * Medicham - This one you have nothing on your team that can hit Super Effective, but don't panic. Just switch to Gyarados, use Intimidate to cut down its attack, then switch to Garchomp (immune to ThunderPunch in case it tries), then Sword Dance as there is NO way it can kill you in 1 hit barring a Critical Hit. Earthquake can kill the rest of his team besides Bronzong, who dies to Fire Fang after 1 Sword Dance, or may live with minimal HP left. Guarentees 2HKO.<br>  * Bronzong - Fire Blast (Azelf/Infernape), Fire Fang (Garchomp, after 1 Sword Dance)<br>  * Alakazam - Night Slash (Weavile)<br>  <br>  C) Cynthia<br>  * Spiritomb - There is no move in the entire game besides Scrappy Fighting/Bug moves from Kangaskhan or Miltank that can hit Super Effective on this thing. The Dark/Ghost combination is super as it has no weaknesses. Don't panic though, as Infernape can't be burnt, and Fire Blast should 2HKO. If you're out of PP, just wear it down with Grass Knot. If it tries to heal, you can get in a free Nasty Plot if you have.<br>  * Garchomp - Ice Punch (Weavile). Weavile MUST be Jolly nature and trained on killing 252 Magikarps and 126 Bibarels. If you are not prepared to face Cynthia's Garchomp, it can ruin your day. Explode Azelf if you need.<br>  * Roserade - Ice Punch (Weavile)<br>  * Gastrodon - Grass Knot (Infernape)<br>  * Milotic - Thunderbolt (Azelf), or wear it down with Gyarados' Earthquake. Use your own Milotic to put it to sleep if you need.<br>  * Lucario - Close Combat (Infernape), Earthquake (Garchomp), Earthquake (Gyarados)<br>  <br>  You'll do fine.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	It is harder to beat than the previos incarnations. I like that. Although the hoenn champs is annoying. But the other elite 4's never had a challenge. Maybe that's because I always played the game properly.<br>  <br>  Kanto was diffucult but weaknesses were easy to exploit. Johto was weak, hoenn was weak save the champ. Sinnoh was a bit more difficult due to computer strategy.

wAiVxAKNaa	Personally, I use the Dawnfang\Duskfang. In my experiences it is the strongest sword in the game, and it only requires one hand.<br>  <br>  According to Oblivion Wiki and UESP.net, and these are direct quotes:<br>  <br>  "Value: 162 - 5046 dependant on what level the sword is gained. <br>  Weight: 19 - 47 dependant on what level the sword is gained. <br>  <br>  The blade has leveled charges ranging from 250 - 3600. Uses range from 50 - 80. <br>  <br>  Dawnfang/Duskfang is a unique leveled sword of Akaviri origin with a unique look. It is an unusual weapon in that it really is four weapons in one. During the day (6 a.m. - 6 p.m.) it is Dawnfang, doing fire damage on strike. During the night (6 p.m. - 6 a.m.) it is Duskfang, doing frost damage on strike (both are leveled, but do the same amount). At dusk and dawn, the blade in your inventory will be replaced with the other.<br>  <br>  Nourish Blade effect: Each weapon keeps track of the number of opponents killed with the blade; providing you killed at least 12 enemies during the preceding 12 hour period, the next blade you receive will be Dawnfang/Duskfang Superior. You must kill 12 enemies in each 12 hour period in order for the following weapon to be the Superior version. Killing your own summons is a good way to obtain the 12 required kills. The Superior version does have an increased enchantment charge and absorbs health (Dawnfang Superior) or magicka (Duskfang Superior) in addition to the previous fire/frost enchantment.<br>  <br>  All four forms of blade are leveled, but all four forms have the same stats at each level. It does not appear to level with the player, it is only leveled to the PC's level when it is first received. The sword will probably never have to be repaired or recharged, as each version comes at 100% health and fully charged. Dawnfang/Duskfang is received at the conclusion of the Baiting the Trap quest.<br>  <br>  Here are a few of its basic effects:<br>  Leveled Fire Damage (Dawnfang) or Frost Damage (Duskfang)<br>  Nourish Blade on Strike"<br>  <br>  This sword is awarded after completing the quest Baiting the Trap. Here is a link to that quest guide. <a href="http://oblivion.wikia.com/wiki/Baiting_the_Trap" rel="nofollow">http://oblivion.wikia.com/wiki/Baiting_t...</a><br>  <br>  You can see individual stats on the UESP site link in my sources.|`|uU8lT4Mqaa	theres a one-handed sword you get in the shivering isles after completing baiting the trap mission (its the main mission) called duskfang/dawnfang during dawn its a different sword then during dusk. it'll weigh about 30 which is knid of heavy but its one handed, has a ton of attack, fire damage, nourish blade, and something else. it was my favorite sword and i think one of the best!
EpGJbHhEaa	I had got that same set and it wouldn't play on my computer. I couldn't figure out how to fix it (my brother couldn't either and he goes to college for computers) I ended up having to play them on a laptop. Maybe certain computer types can't read that particular game?

AA11678263	You know what, sometimes they are just reluctant to come out!!!  I'm not sure why, but I've had houses with tonnes of graves and very little ghostly activity.  It's nothing to do with the cheat, because I've also made a plague pit before (storytelling you understand...) and had millions of ghosts surging about because I kept moving people in and killing them with the death creator.  Ghosts usually haunt between 1am and 5am though.  Keeo your eyes peeled.  Mine only ever haunt on the ground floor also.|`|vWucEcNJaa	Its can be because you used a cheat.If you have sims 2 university press CTRL+SHIFT+C and click on a sim and type "unlockCareerRewards" then go to the career rewards part of THAT sim.You will see a kind of a monster plant.Put it in your house and feed it.It will get a vine cake.Make someone you want to kill ,eat it and then you will see the grave.Then you will also see the ghost soon.

Why would they need to, since probably half the people that own a DS will buy the DSi as well.|`|q6uyloYdaa	They might let you buy and download GBA games but I doubt they will ever make something that will let you physically put the game in the system.|`|FxzijnSIaa	Actually, this does seem like a possibility, after all, it would probably cos 20-30 bucks, just another thing you you to buy for Nintendo to make money. I'm sure if it was done easy enough, and no major updating was needed, I'm pretty sure they'd do it. =)<br>  <br>  ~Pie Guy 360|`|sTF73lKwaa	actually, now that I think about it, knowing Nintendo, they will probably start selling the DSi, and then make an attachment and make a huge deal out of it and get everyone to by it|`|9jgFYazZaa	i dont think they will, because gamers now a days dont really want to play GBA games sorry, this also means no Guitar Hero On tour for DSi ;..(

RnmYc0lhaa	I heard the DSi will be getting rid of the Game Boy Advance slot, which is where the Guitar Grip goes on a regular DS or DS Lite, so sadly the DSi can't play Guitar Hero On Tour...<br>  <br>  I would stick with the DS Lite. Actually I am :P|`|Px2fKrDzaa	plz get a real video game system|`|sTF73lKwaa	No, unless they make a special button pushing thingy for it.  The DSi is only cool cause it's got the cameras, taking off the GBA slot was a bad idea|`|9jgFYazZaa	Nope sorry it does not support GBA periphials

Chose save to hard drive.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	You'd have to hack the old Xboxes to save play files directly to the hard-drive for discless play. I don't like messing with soft-mods since they can ruin your system. You could buy a DVD repair kit for about 50$.

cCAGstnpaa	G forces are the gravitational pull you feel during the ride. For example, when you are going down the drop, you feel positive G's which means that you are being pushed down in to your seat. And when you shoot up fast and go up over a hill, that is negative G's which pull out of your seat. And weightlessness is when you feel like you are floating.|`|U0LPJ2Puaa	"G" stands for gravity.  It is when the force of gravity pushes you into your seat and keeps you from falling out of your chair.  The most obvious is on the "LOOPS".  When you start to go up into the loop, the g forces hold you into your seat and that is why you don't fall out while you are upside down.|`|2Kv5Fzopaa	G forces is basically a measurement of how much force gravity is exerting on you. Your weight is how much force gravity is exerting on you since gravity is trying to pull you to the center of the Earth. On roller coasters, it varies at parts of the ride. There are two types of gravity being exerted on you, positive and negative, both keeping each other in check so you are not crushed nor go flying off into space (they are very rarely equal though).<br>  <br>  At various parts during a roller coaster ride, the g forces change. At the top of large hills the train crests, "airtime" is experienced here because the positive and negatives g-forces are equal and give the faint sense of weightlessness, as felt in space. The most powerful g forces are experienced during high speed helices, bottom of large drops, and the bottom of inversions (loops, corkscrews, etc.)|`|ouq1hAQCaa	It stands for GRAVITATIONAL FORCES its not good to go over 12 g, 1 g is x2 of your body weight basically.
MDf0BoiNaa	first off, the notion that the elite is the onyl model that has the jasper chip isnt true. its in all of them now<br>  <br>  that said, theres no reason to spend the money for all that extra memory, because you cant really make good use of it. i bought it after owning a ps3 for a while (on which you can easily copy all the videos and mp3's you want, and you cant copy any of that stuff to the hard drive on 360) you might as well get the pro (60gb) model.<br>  <br>  as for the falcon, it should be fine. sure it gets hot, but that's to be expected. its not extremely loud (louder than the ps3, but whatever). <br>  <br>  i think youre making this into more than it is. the difference between the chips isnt really going to make all the difference. i say chances are, if you get rrod'ed, (in my opinion) you are at least partly to blame. and the habits you have that make it happen will likely make it happen no matter what.<br>  <br>  in any case, microsoft has a 3 year warranty, under which theyll fix whatever happens, so its not like it really matters either way.<br>  <br>  if youre hell bent on finding a jasper, read this <a href="http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/paul/archive/2008/12/12/how-to-find-a-jasper-xbox-360.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/...</a>|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Per MS: There is no way for the average joe to be sure they have a Jasper.   Elites and Pros and Arcades are all getting Jaspers...it's just a matter of time ^_^|`|JkIKYtC9aa	I bought a Premium 360 a year and a half ago. It died with the Red Ring of Death. It was under warranty and got it fixed, but then I decided to get a 360 Elite/Falcon chip around the same time when my 360 broke, and it has been running good, it is loud and gets a little hot but, if you keep it and the power supply in a good ventilated area you should be ok. I got a little wire rack from wal-mart for 12 bucks which keeps my 360 elevated from the ground and providing more and better airflow. Hope that helps.|`|9HX04GjSaa	Yes you should buy a 360 Elite, I bought an XBox 360 Elite over a year ago, and it's still working fine.If you do get the chance get the Elite package that comes with Resident Evil 5.|`|coyDMtUsaa	GET PS3!!!

ZoXGErk9aa	Mabinogi is a great game with or without nx. To be honest it only sucks if you have no friends in game and your completely broke...My advice...ask friends for help often... But if you feel like a loser for not being able to make money fast...well give up...play something else if you dont like. Though it has become a bit hard to make some money currently because of the new recent update....my advice is do dungeons with friends...if you have no friends...make some...if you cant...well.....goodluck loser...thats it..|`|ZKIKLh2Caa	i recommend u play combat arms too|`|3SL8wdUraa	not rly play combat arms or somethin i dont like too much of the games made by uhh i forgot who made it lol

Delivered to my home no payment required, with an extended warranty, and gets free gas for the lifetime of the car. My friend these things don't just happen. If you think about it a cell phone actually costs as much as a new Kia if you have good credit. You can get a $10k car for $200 a month if you have good credit. You only have to pay on the car for five years tops. Free phones come with a plan they know they are going to get at least $600 dollars a year from you. There aren't too may good plans for $50 dollars a month. You can get a prepaid phone for free and not need a credit card, but you have to buy a bunch of minutes to get the phone for free. What you want is going to be hard. If you have good credit you may be able to haggle the manager at the kiosk in your local mall to get close to what you want. The manager does have the ability to drop down payments and offer better free phones.|`|08cdf2a24083a3fb03a629b14a60252caa	your free phone is in the mail|`|c46cd5c9e46293a0a73eb1a2afb5198eaa	I was hooked up to tracfhone and now I am on my parents plan but tracfone is very good try that for a while to see how it goes from julie
