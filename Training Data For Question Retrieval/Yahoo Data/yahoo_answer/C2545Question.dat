A school bus is travelling south and in the far right lane of 3 lanes.  There is a large median separating those 3 lanes and 3 lanes with traffic travelling north.  If the school bus stops and puts the stop sign out, does the traffic travelling north on the opposite side of the median have to stop?

When I go to brake heavily the truck shakes misrably.  I don't feel it in the pedal but the steering wheel and truck shakes pretty bad.  When you brake normal and lightly there is no problem at all.  No squeaks, nothing, just shakes bad when brakes are applied just a little harder than normal.  Any suggestions as to what the problem might be?  
20090216115542AAkeK2T	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Comment conduire une voiture ?	Voilà. Je reviens de Managua (Nicaragua) et j'y ai acheté un permis.  Je suis rentré en France il y a 4 semaines et j'ai eu le temps de faire modifier mon permis (accords bilatéraux). J'ai même acheté une voiture !!! Une Laguna toute neuve. Je vais la chercher chez le concessionnaire demain ou après demain.      Mon problème c'est que j'ai encore jamais conduit. Je suis un peu stressé d'autant plus que je ne trouve pas de cours intensifs sur internet...      Pouvez vous m'expliquer rapidement les bases ?   Ou bien m'aiguiller sur un site qui donne des cours ?   J'apprends très vite (heureusement)...
20090203075607AAI1S9s	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Question about Cars..........................…	I brought a car recently from a company which sells used cars and we paid in full cash. The thing is, the dealer said the car would be delivered to us on Monday.      It didn't come on Monday, presumably because it was dangerous due to heavy snow where i live.         Then they said they would call us in the afternoon and bring the car. They didnt do this so we called them to bring the car.      I wasn't at home in the afternoon so my brother answered the door and told my brother that we had to pay ￡80 because the man brought the car to our house!       Our house is about 45 mins away from his business and he didn't tell us this when we brought the car OR phoned to ask him to bring the car!      Isn't this ridiculous? We paid him for the purchase of the car, he isnt a taki driver and even if he was - even taxi drivers dont ask for ￡80!
20090220164806AAmJFe5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Do I need an oil  change or can it  wait?	I have a 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid and on my trip to Syracuse my maintenance minder went on saying I need an oil change because my oil life is at 15%.        I then drove another hundred miles or two.  Now I have to drive back to CT and I can't get an oil change until after work on Monday.        I will be driving 300+ more miles until I can get to Honda... Can I wait until then or should I get an oil change while I'm here?        I really want to get it at Honda so I can get free tires, but I'd rather be safe if I have to!

20090203075728AAkwZLo	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Driving Record Results?	I was under the impression my license was suspended for a "minor in posession of alcohol" charge which people said would get my license suspended.  I'm almost 21.  The court date was 3 months ago.  I plead guilty and never went to court.  I wasn't in a car or operating a car at the time of the charge.  So I ordered a driving record to check my license status (because DMV told me that was the best way to find out).      I see my previous suspension and all violations on here BUT Nothing mentioning that charge.  The only suspension says it ended Feb 2, 2008 which was the first time it got suspended.  Other than that my license status is simply listed as EXPIRED (it expired last month) and not SUSPENDED and doesn't show any current suspensions.      This record is the same information DMV has, correct? I'm in the state of virginia.  If the court had issued a suspension it would of taken effect a long time ago, right (since court was 3 months ago)?       So basically, I just need to renew my license (I know the process since it's expired)... and I can have a new one since I have no suspension current on my driver record and my current status is simply expire, not suspended with no valid suspensions?      Just confirming this?

20090220164319AAwnpyB	Cars & Transportation;Safety	What to do if someone follows you while driving.?	This car was originally in front of me but then the lanes became two so I turned into the other lane but not to get around them. When the two lanes became one again, that car ended up behind me.       At first, I thought the car was going the same few streets at first but I noticed that when I was stopped at a light, I would move forward a bit and so would they. They, 3 girls in the car, eventually took the same route that I did and at first, I brushed it off because I thought they were going to pick someone up at the station because many people go to the station.       However, when I parked in the lot, they parked right behind us. My friend nor I got out of the car because we waited to see what would they do. They were waiting for us to get out I presume. I decided not to get out and just drive off; the car took off following right behind me again.       When exiting the lot, I didn't put on my signal and decided to turn left. The driver was pointing to turn right but too bad, I didn't go right.  That damn car started honking the horn when I didn't turn left (there was a car coming down the left side). To annoy them, I didn't go. I know that's not the brightest idea to do but hey, it's in the past now. I lost them a few seconds later behind a bus.       They didn't and I got my friend to the station in time.       But I've never been in that kind of experience before.  I don't know what set off the driver to follow me like that but I was upset, scared and annoyed.       The bottom line is what do I do if I'm in this situation again?       Please and Thanks.

20090203075109AAQxLKF	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Driving on someone elses car insurance?	I'm 18 and shopping for car insurance and the quotes are ridiculous, (like 280 a month for minimal coverage). However would it be possible/legal to have my girlfriend who is 20 and in college be the legal owner of the car and have the car under her policy, but I drive it daily and still be covered?      The insurance quotes for her are MUCH cheaper, like (40 a month). The reason I'm asking is because a friend of mine told me that as long as the car I'm driving is insured by someone, and I'm driving with their consent, I'm insured. Is this true?
