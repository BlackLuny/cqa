20090309190221AABroFh	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Just got my brakes fixed, is a whistling sound normal?	I recently had to get my brakes fixed (like 3 weeks ago) at Goodyear, and they said they had to resurface the rotors. I drove around for about 2 weeks before i decided they are far worse than before, plus they make a bad squeak when they never did that before the service.      So today, i got it redone. Now, they dont stop any better (or at least i cant tell). But when i slow down using the brakes, they make a whistling noise that goes from really high pitch to a really low pitch until i come to a complete stop. Its not a squeak, its a whistle sound, similar to something you hear on an airplane or something.      Is this normal?

20090309191207AAL3g82	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	How can I get out of this car loan?	Please, I hope someone in this community can help me.  I know this story is long but if you know anything about car loans, please read it! Bless you!        I bought a car in July from a local dealer in Glen Burnie, Md.  I don't have a lot of cash and my credit isn't great.  It is a saturn station wagon that had over 100,000 miles on it at purchase.  The car broke down in a parkinglot one week after I purchased it.  The dealer cleaned the battery and put me back on the road.  The car would cut out at red lights, would turn off when idling.  I took it to them time and again and was told they would help me, that it would be fixed.  The repairs came out of pocket for me, plus the agreed monthly payments.  The mechanic they sent me to replaced the waterpump stating that it was not sending the coolant to the engine and thats what was happening.  The problem persisted, so the dealer turned up the idle.  Each month I would take it back, over and over, being told that they would take me to court for the full amount of the loan if I backed out of this.  The problems got worst, sure it wasn't idling at redlights now.  What it was doing though was cutting out while in motion.  It broke down before christmas and i had to pay to have it tow.  They said it was a bad starter and replaced it, I didn't have the money for the repair and the tow - so they tacked the price onto my total due. I got the car back the day before new years and it cut out while in motion again.  I left it at the dealer and the mechanic replaced a TPI sensor.  This did not fix it.  They said it was a bad sensor and replaced that, once again - did not fix it.        I gave them the car and the keys back.  This is after desperately asking them to place me in a new car, transfer my loan, anything.  I have dropped everything I have into this - and I have nothing.  After giving the car back to them, after it broke down in the middle of the highway, in the rain, causing me to be pulled over by the police, they still would do nothing.        Days later they told me that they would take the car to auction and tack the money it brought against the money left on the total amount I owe.  (1,900).  They said they would place me into a car on their lot, I got a huge runaround and finally the owner tells me he will place me in a van and I can make payments on that.  I am still responsible for the 1,900 minus whatever the saturn brings in at auction.  I'm told to come back the next day and test drive it.  I come by and am told he's with another customer, after waiting for an hour I leave.  I try to reach him the next day to no avail.  I call him again today, the third day and he tells me he needs a couple hours but he has something worked out for me and to come by after work.       Then when I get there he tells me that he can't transfer me to another vehicle because I don't have any money down.  He also says he won't enter into a loan on another vehicle with me because he doesn't know if the business would be there long enough for me to pay off the loan.  He tells me that it is a mapping sensor now that they have to replace, and that he is going to drive the car around for a few days to see if it happens again.  Then he stated if that didn't fix it, he would see what he could do to try and help me get into something else.      I don't know what to do.  I'm so lost and upset right now.  I'm on a fixed income, I have a child to think about, I don't have the money for this but I work in Annapolis which is a good 30 minutes from my house.  I'm not covered by the lemon law or by the implied warranty law.  I'm stuck, and I'm scared to get behind the wheel of that car.  It almost killed me once.  Please help me.

It is a 1.8 litre, not a 1.6 litre engine. 316i is just the model number, NOT the engine size. It is a 1995 BMW E36 316i 1.8 litre four cylander.

It looks like the only thing wrong with it is that the A/C isn't working. Will it take much money/effort to fix this problem? The Used Car guy said it's blowing air but it isn't cold. If I leave this problem until just before summertime can it lead to other problems? Luckily I have my brother who can do it for nice and cheap as he is a mechanic. He's  at work right now and I don't want to bug him. I'm just anxious for an answer as I want to go buy a vehicle asap. Also I live in Canada and the car is supposed to be in miles and up here we use kilometers. Any ecomical way I can get it changed to KM on the speedometre etc?? That won't be too much of a hassle either will it? Also it is 220,000+ KM or 138,408miles, think it is worth buying for $4800 CDN???

20081107110443AAmtaFh	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	I can't afford my car payment!?	I bought a 2004 Honda Civic after my first car was declared a lemon. My payments were $250 a month and I can afford that. However, the car is in my mom's name, but I pay the 250 myself. She had a deal that as long as I stayed at home for school (going to a community college), she would pay my car insurance until I got in my first accident. Well, I got in my first accident a couple days ago. It was a fender bender and all I did was take paint off of the other cars' back bumper in the corner. I told the girl I hit that I would pay for the paint job (because it wasn't that bad). My car has more scratches than hers does from the accident. She told me that she didn't want that and called the police. The police officer said that the damage to her car was $1000!! How in the hell is it $1000? All she needs is touch up paint, seriously. She didn't have one scratch on it, just chipped paint.      Well, I can't afford my car insurance and payment each month now. My insurance before my accident was over $200 a month. I have to pay for school and I have a minimum paying job, so I couldn't afford that. Now I really can't afford it and I'm afraid my insurance is going to shoot over $300! I don't know what to do. I can't afford my car and my mom isn't helping at all. I got a $144 ticket, which I am going to take driving school for to get the points off of my license. But, since there was an accident, my insurance will still go up regardless if I take the driving school or not.      I just want to get rid of the car and buy a $1000 one until I can afford payments. And since my new car will be paid for, I can have the bare minimum for my insurance policy. Can I just give the car back? I bought it from a tent sale, not a dealership. HELP!? I'm lost and don't know what to do!

I have become interested in car restorations and hot rod builds, mostly old 60's and 70's classics. I already have one issue of Popular Hotrodding in which the cover article was Build Your First Engine: Save money and wrench it yourself, but it only went so far. I want to learn how to rebuild a car, engine, how to do metal work, paint work, dealing with rust, interior work, ect. Pretty much everything that goes into (re)building a car. Though I know it takes a lot of practice, it's the money that's hindering me from getting my hands dirty. So as long as I can read up on some literature and get a good idea in my mind of what to do and how to do it I'll be a happy camper. If any one has any other suggestions on how to get into the hobby, despite I don't have a car to rebuild, please let me know. I'm open to almost anything right now.      PS: Maybe motorcycles would be a better place to start if money was such an issue?
