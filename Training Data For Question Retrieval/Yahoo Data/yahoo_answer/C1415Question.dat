20090226130905AAa3Uwq	Social Science;Psychology	Do dying loved ones see others who have passed already when they are real close to passing themselves?	I have cared for my mom with MS since I was eight years old and have been caring for her full-time the last 5 years, I am now 36 married with children and she lives with us (24/7 care). None the less it has been real hard despite support networks I have but recently she has been really scaring me because she continually talks about dying and her funeral plus she has full conversations with my grandmother, grandfather, and my father who all have passed. I will ask her who she is talking to and that is the answer I get. The other morning she woke my husband up yelling that my dad would not get up, real confused. Do you think she may know it is close to her time. Please keep in mind that her mental state has not been real good in the last five years or so, but this is the first time she has consistently talked of dying.      It is ok to think it is her time to go?      What do any of you think, please no rude answers it is hard enough.......

20090226135436AAq3Wdr	Social Science;Psychology	Am I depressed...and any advice?	Okay, so lately I've been really tired like all the time.  Sometimes I just skip out on school, because I'm so tired and like over-booked.  I'm a sophomore and I have a lot of honors/AP work almost every day.  I get home at about 5pm each day and even by then I'm like super tired.  I get stressed out a lot, and I miss a lot of school because of it.  I just don't have enough time to finish my work at home so I just end up skipping school the next day and finishing my work at home (like I'm doing today).  Sometimes I feel as if I'm like really lonely and super lazy, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  Like I have work to do in front of me, but I just don't have the motivation and effort to finish it all and I end up procrastinating.       I really want to get into a good university on the east coast and become successful and prove that I am worth something, but my laziness, tiredness, and lack of motivation are hurting my grades to the point where I highly doubt I can get into the universities I want to (I went from a 4.0 (weighted) end of freshman year to a 3.4 (weighted--2.9 unweighted) first semester of sophomore year.  I have this semester left to bring that grade up to at least a 4.14 (weighted)!!!!!!      On top of all of that, I feel as if all my teachers, friends, and my mom are disappointed in me for missing so much school and being tired and stressed all the time.  I barely have any time to myself, and when I do have time I usually spend it sleeping or doing nothing to just get a little bit of relaxation in everyday.       I feel as if everything is piling up at once, and this is just making me not want to go to school anymore--but everyday I miss is just like another day I have to make up (I already have to make up like 2 tests, and a bunch of homework assignments not to mention a competition tomorrow which I haven't prepared for because I've been so busy!).      What should I do, and any advice?  (Please keep answers serious =[ )

20090226093935AAKFtdj	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it wrong to NOT be bothered by catcalls?	I've seen many women get up in arms about catcalls, getting hit on in the bar, attention from strangers, etc etc.  And it got me wondering.  Is there something wrong with a woman who is unbothered or unperturbed by catcalls, getting hit on, approached in a bar, etc?      For example, I'm rarely ever bothered by the attention--and I've been through some pretty wild catcalls when I was the military.  It just never bothered me and often I'm quite flattered.  (Except for in Brussels.  The men's attention there is down right scary).        Does this show an inherent low self-esteem in a woman who isn't bothered by overt male attention?  As if she's looking for self-validation in her looks?  SHOULD a woman be bothered by it?      Women, how do you feel when a random guy hits on you or tries to get your attention?

20090226140020AAZTEfY	Social Science;Psychology	Are you ever surprised when your own peers believe something you thought impossible to believe?	For example, in Canada most people wouldn't even dream of believing in a literal interpretation of the Bible, where the world was created in 7 days, that evolution doesn't exist.  However, it seems that in the U.S., which is so close to us, many people actually do believe that.      Also, Americans have gone to wars that don't make any sense to Canadians, like Vietnam and Iraq.      I thought this type of thing was limited to older generations, but when I look, I see my peers and people younger than I believing these contrary things.  I'm baffled.      And you?

The entire time, I'm doing all the talking, and she just goes, "mmm. mmmm. ok. ok. so how does that make you feel?" and then when I stop talking, it becomes dead silent. So I asked her, "so what do you think I should do?", and she goes, "Oh, i don't know. Do whatever you think is best."       I became frustrated. Are all help lines like this? Aren't they supposed to be helping out, or are they just supposed to sit there and listen inanimately as if you are talking to a wall?   Just wondering.

He also knows of my problems outside college and inside college, i am behind on work and have attempted suicide, he knows im a quiet lad who doesnt speak much, so when he said are you a bigtime charlie which means gangster or tough guy i think hes mocking me and when he said in the same sentance is it cause the girls always ring you that you never answer the phone, im far from a ladies man and below average looking so is he patronizing and mocking me with the others...........i also know my personal problems and myself have been discussed in the staff room...........PLEASE HELP 10 POINTS TO A GOOD AND DETAILED ANSWER..........THANKS

20090226134514AAIzgpW	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Extremely weird dream?	all right everyone is gonna think im crazy or on drugs(which im not) but this dream really disturbed me...so maybe someone could help me out:   my mom handed me a shovel and told me to clean up the yard. i was confused but i did wat she told me. when i get out there, theres a bunch of debree all around. as the dream went on the debree started to be dead animals, like rodents (rabbits, woodchucks lol) I was wondering how everytime i turned around there was more dead animals. (which by the way had horrible expressions on their face) as i kept shoveling them up rasberry bushes kept growing around me. i would get stuck to the thorns but i kept eating the rasberries. then as i reached for one, a thorn pricked my finger and it started to bleed. then i woke up.      so thats my crazy dream lol not very pleasant and extremely wierd.

20090226140240AAjg0TA	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I feel doomed?	I did decent in high school so far--not great--but decent. I'm a senior now, with a 3.55 unweighted GPA, and 4.30 weighted GPA, and I got into every college I applied to including Penn State, UMD college park, and virginia tech.   But I'm taking 3 AP classes now, and everyone in my class is obviously a genius--literally the majority of the class are straight A students. I feel like an idiot, because I'm literally failing now, with D's in two of my classes (with A's in all the other ones) and the worst part is, I'm trying so hard to do well but something is not working...it could be a lack of sleep, because I study SO much that I get 3 hours of sleep a night.    I feel like all the colleges are going to reject me now. That will make me feel more like an idiot. I'm obviously a failure that's not as good as everyone else, and my teachers HATE me. Because I'm a failure. I can tell because they love to embarrass me in front of the entire class.      I know I'm making a big deal out of this, but I'm constantly surrounded by smart, straight-A students and it's not fair. I think I'm depressed, because I lack the energy to do anything.   Any advice?

Ok well today i had a huge social problem, i was at college and went to the staff room to hand in my homework and i felt as though i was being heavily patronized by the tutors, firstly one of them started talking about how bad this ginger kids haircut is, and i said i'd seen it, i didn't mock him or anything and then this tutor who was the main one involved asked me if i was getting the haircut, i don't think he was just having a laugh when he asked i think he was patronizing......then secondly my main tutor came in the staff room and because im so far behind on work the guy who slated the guys hair cut asked if i need a new tutor to try and get a friendly jab at my main tutor..........then i said yeah as a joke and then he said in a patronizing tone "good lad"      Then the worst part followed, i was about to leave the room when, this woman who helps with college work said i don't answer my phone so he said my name as i was about to leave and called me over and said......"why don't you answer your phone, are you a big time charlie or something, or is it cause too many calls from the girls" it seemed very odd that he called me over to his desk which was a good 10 feet away from the door just to say that and it seemed patronizing.      He also knows of my problems outside college and inside college, i am behind on work and have attempted suicide, he knows im a quiet lad who doesnt speak much, so when he said are you a bigtime charlie which means gangster or tough guy i think hes mocking me and when he said in the same sentance is it cause the girls always ring you that you never answer the phone, im far from a ladies man and below average looking so is he patronizing and mocking me with the others...........i also know my personal problems and myself have been discussed in the staff room...........PLEASE HELP 10 POINTS TO A GOOD AND DETAILED ANSWER..........THANKS

20090226143136AAjdPiT	Social Science;Psychology	Would you say this is depression?	In the past half year or so, I have become really pessemistic.       Yes, i am over-weight by about 20 pounds, and im working on taking those 20 pounds off.      I have recently closed myself up. I used to absolutly LOVE swimming and hanging with friends. Now, whenever swimming comes I just feel like sitting at home. I'm spending a load of time in my room, my grades are dropping horribly. I used to be a straight A student, now I am a straight C student. I just can't concentrate. I feel like I cause most problems my family goes through.      Yes, I think about suicide a lot. ANd osmetime ways of committing suicide. I have been tempted to do it also. For the past couple of weeks, I have cried myself to sleep. I feel as if everyone around me is so much prettier and like I'm the oen with teh huge nose and stomach. Music really calms me.      Now to teh heart of the whole thing. My mother makes some really rude comments baout me, "Loose some weight, in a couple years you won't be able to fit into your seat."     "Hello my little piggy."   (over at someoen's house) "No, she'll have a salad, she's loosing weight."      My parents swear a lot. They aren't very cultural adn modern around the hose. My dad will walk around in his underwear, without a shirt on, my mom will too. They don't care about their appearance at home, (Like Jenny and Dan's dad, Rufus, from teh Gossip Girl books).      Yes, everytime they make a comment about my mood swings calling me some bad name, telling me there's something wrong with my head.      They are not born in america but Poland,   they believe that diseases of the brain make you psycho and therapists don't help.   I wake up in the morning and when Im laying in bed and hear my mother's voice, I feel pure hatred run through my veins.      I feel hopless, and my future is a black hole.      Is this depression?   If so,   are there any things I can do by myself that can pull me out from depression?   Aso, How serious is my condition?

20090226140153AALWyfL	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is giving birth the ultimate act of selfishness?	Why do people have kids?      I've asked it before. The standard responses were "for fulfillment," "to carry on the family name/genes," "because I wanted one" etc.      Every answer had one thing in common--motivated by self-interests.      Not one person said "I wanted to have a child so that he/she can experience all the wonderful things I have in my life."      My problem is, even if that was the sole reason for someone having a child, they have absolutely no idea what the child's future holds. I think people assume that because they are happy and enjoy life that their offspring will too. Do they not acknowledge that the child might grow up to be miserable, wishing that they had never been born? Do they not acknowledge that they might become a serial killer or some other heinous criminal? Or do they acknowledge these things and (dare I say selfishly) choose to ignore them?      Consent seems to be an important component of many things. You can't have sex with someone without their consent, that's rape and it is viewed as a terrible crime. Yet that same act (sexual intercourse) can give birth to a child who has not given his/her consent to be born. Is that not also raping the child (figuratively)? If we can bring someone into the world without their consent, why is it seen as wrong to remove someone from the world, without their consent? Who placed so much value on life? Why is life seen as a "gift"?      Would you have a child that would not bring any fulfillment to your life? Would you have a child that would not pass on your family name/genes? Would you have a child if you knew that it would never love you?      There's a lot of questions, sorry, but try your best =)

I tend to want alot of attention at times, or show people I care for them by being clingy and annoying. OR.. lately, I drop it altogether, and act like I dont care much about anything.      It's hard for me to be in the middle. I guess it's because I can't express my care towards someone or get attention from people in certain ways that others might be able to do.        I have a friend, who is sort of perfect when it comes to communicating with people. She expresses her interest in people by laughing alot, giving people eye contact when shes talking to them, asking alot of questions but not too many, and talking friendly.       Doing those things make me uncomfortable. I don't know why? Even people I have known for YEARS, I cannot directly look them in the eye and talk. It's like,when I make myself do it, it becomes impossible. I also cannot laugh alot or say "yes" and speak aloud, like make comments of approval. Its hard for me ?       I can't seem to generate my attention in that way. I just want to spit it all out, and than it usually comes out too strong, and I end up making people feel weird, and not really connecting with people.

I was at work so i asked if i could call her back. When i got the chance to call her back there was no answer. I called my sister she couldnt get in touch with her either. So a few more hours went by no word from her. (i live 600 miles away otherwise i would have gone to her house) So the next day i get a call she was found dead sitting upright indian style on the couch by the boyfriend of the deceased family friend. When i got into town that next morning i learned they had been together wed. night Lou had died in her bed thursday night. My mom died the following night which was friday. There are a few more factors that in my opinion are suspicious but i am not sure if my mind is just running away from me. This was never questioned by the authorities. My mom was 48 to young to die. Autopsy shows it was a heart attack. Lou didnt have an autopsy. Is this suspicious or am i just thinking into this way to much?

20090226142452AAwMNXS	Social Science;Psychology	Possible pyschological problem?	I really have no idea what's wrong with me. I'm 16 and I hate to be around people and even talk to them. I hate being part of society and technology. When I say technology, I don't just mean t.v.s and computers, I mean anything not primitive. I do admit it's useful, but I hate using it and it makes me depressed to use it. I recently just bought a pair of skis and ski boots and I know that I won't be able to use them to next season but I realize that I hate buying things. It just tears me apart and it has been that way. I rather make my own things. I sometimes just think that I should have been born 1000 years ago. I know I'm advanced and not dumb because I finished 10th grade in a month with all 95's and above and got a scholarship to do college now. But even that doesn't make me happy. To me college is just an extension of high school learning pointless knowledge that doesn't help in surviving with my own two hands. I don't have girl friend because I choose not to have one. I see no need to have a relationship with anyone, and I do much better on my own. I rather have a torch than a flashlight, a tepee rather than a house, and a bow rather than a gun. I rather get rid of all modern technology in my lift and live primitively. Do I have some kind of physcological problem because everyone around me says I do.

Instead this person claims we are all out to get him.  This person also seems mentally unstable and some employees are concerned that something might happen to one of us.

20090226144237AAy9lQC	Social Science;Psychology	Personality of INTP people?	I am not exactly sure if I fall in this category but here is a little information about me.    - I challenge my parents and often stump them, especially about religion.   - I am an atheist.    - I enjoy mysteries and documentaries that most of my fellow classmates would not watch/learn about.   - I enjoy social science/humanities (history, psychology and and philosophy).   - I used to be an honor roll student, but the last year of my high school I lost interest, and I found this particularity in INTP people. They either are successful or they fail.   - I believe I know more than the teacher, especially in the fields of humanities, thus I tend to often say some tests are dumb.   - I like cosmology and quite often it leads me to thinking about possibilities by studying known facts..it intrigues me so much that I tend to voice my opinion, but most often I do not.    - I like to be in my own world, thinking and processing in peace.   - No need for social interaction.   - Tend to fall in love hard.   - Show exceptional interest in what I like, the rest I find irrelevant.   - I like to think out of the box, thus I am a big skeptic.   - I do not seek help in what I do, group work is frowned upon.   - I enjoy being creative and to work independently.   - I like writing poems and reading literature and intellectual writings.   - I like reading and computer related studies.    - I enjoy writing in big words, my thoughts are deep and intriguing.    - I am not talkative and tend to frequently stare off into space, thinking about the present time, the world situation and the point of our existence. To me it is mind boggling.    - Can be arrogant   - I dislike higher grade students who earn better marks. I do not believe that it shows intellect or uniqueness. It certainly shows commitment, but they would never understand me and my complex thoughts.    - I tend to take into account the nature of my location. Every visualization and sound I perceive into my complex thought. Staring at a tree, the sky or even the passing of people or the sound of the environment. Many thoughts come into my head, it is like every object has an answer that I am trying to decipher.   - I seek the truth    - I contradict myself, yet in the end I believe in the good of humanity.   - I get frustrated when I am disturbed.   - I believe in science, and i ardently love theory.       Could this be because I am some sort of Emo person? Though I am not. Or could it be that I tend to stare off or think like this because I do not enjoy human interaction? Maybe these things are true...maybe I am depressed. One important fact about me is that I been through a lot and seen a lot. When I was small I used to blink excessively. My parents sent me to a doctor (at the time in Serbia) and doctor concluded that I have seen something horrible and horrendous. I seen what war really is, through the eyes of a two year old I have seen death and tragic drama.       Could this be the reason that led me to be like this?   I need help.            In the end, I am tending to drift away from those traits particularity due to society
20090226144802AAzuXEG	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have an anxiety disorder?	I've been thinking that I do because i'm showing symptoms, although I don't know if it's something I should be concerned about.      For about a few years now, my hands have been shaking/trembling without stopping. It's as if they do it naturally. I also often get scared to go out and do things with people, even if they're really close friends. I have a feeling something's going to go wrong or they won't like me. These thoughts just repeat over and over again until I tell myself I can't go and make up some excuse to get out of it. I'm always doing it, yet I complain how I don't get out enough. I also feel like people are always watching me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I get really sweaty and clammy. I get hot and cold like I have a fever and my stomach gets upset to the point where I refuse to eat, or I almost throw up. I can't go to school dances and am afraid to attend a formal or prom at my school because i'm not sure if i can handle it. I tend to worry about almost everything, even if it isn't my own problem. I'll carry other people's problems around with me as well. I'll stress about a math test for days or where I'm going to go to college and think I'm not going to be successful in this world, and I'm only fifteen! My mind's always on overdrive and because of these thoughts, I often have trouble sleeping as well and have to take sleeping pills.      I don't know for sure if I do have an anxiety disorder and I was wondering if anybody had any knowledge about it or if I possibly do?      Thanks.

20090226145841AAzRcNk	Social Science;Psychology	We're more than best friends, more than just FWB, but not BF/GF. What is he doing/thinking?	*WARNING: This is rather long. Sorry*      So, I live together with my best friend,and his nearly 3yr old child.   We've lived together for a little over a year now and as things would have it; we have also had an intimate relationship for almost a year now...      So the back-story goes; his, now ex, girlfriend of 4yrs and mother of his child was a really emotionally,mentally, even financially abusive person to him - and his child. So he eventually had enough and asked her to leave. This she did w/o hesitation, and has since only taken their kid on her own 1 time for 1hr in the past year + a few months, along with never paying child support, and moving a few states away.      All this being said, He likes to bring up how when he was a TEENAGER & early 20's. he believed in Poly-amory (not polygamy). He's not a teenager anymore. And he basically says he hates relationships because you lose yourself, your freedom, etc....and says a monogamous relationship is not in his future. ( Yet has since been monogamous with me for almost a year now.) His actions speak louder than words, to say the least.   (I hope)      (Maybe I'm wrong - but I do believe that this is selfish on his part, considering that perhaps this is not what his child will want, and he is solely trying to protect himself from heartache etc...w/o full considering his child's wants, perhaps even needs.)      Anyway. Over the course of our, now intimate relationship, he has treated me on many many occasions much more like a GF as opposed to a simple FWB.   (He even admits we're not just regular FWB)      His family, and mine all are convinced we are 'secretly' together. These speculations are brought about because he brings me along to his family, bdays, holidays, get-togethers...and simply just to go hang out with them. Things like going to get dinner with both sets of his parents, or staying late at their house to play games.      -He has sometimes acted in a BF/GF manner toward me in front of his friends. Kissing me on the head, rubbing my arms, holding my hand, even making out with me before.   -He's said to other people before how he would 'like to date (me)'   -That I would be his choice steal for a GF.   -He's admitted that we were 'dating' - but not in an "exclusive" way.   -He'll tell me how I'm his 'best friend", and he has "a lot of love" for me, and how I make him feel "secure" and he "trusts" me more than anyone - and will do things such as kiss me after these things are said.   -He always always lets me know how much he appreciates me and everything I've done for him and his kid.   -He makes note constantly about how much his child 'loves' and 'adores' me.   -That the 3 of us have inadvertently created a nuclear family.         When I ask him why he's chosen not to sleep with other girls, despite his chances, he raises his voice and simply gives me a "because I chose NOT to" answer.   And when he has been asked if someone were to question his being "in love" w/ another person; he said he'd deny it and say "NO" even if he was in fact "in love" with them.         There is a strong solidarity between us and we both mutually help each other out.      The 3 of us share a bed at night. When I am lying next to him, he will hold me super close, hold my hand, rub my head, ears, shoulders etc...   And sometimes when he wakes up "before" me he does such things as stroke my face, pet my hair, or kiss my forehead.         It's now come around that he has basically realized fully that I like him...A LOT. Perhaps even the L word could be used. (for him and his child). This knowledge doesn't seem to make him falter in his behaviors toward me. But he makes it a reminder that we are not exclusive and he won't have a relationship...and that he's sorry if he has given me any mixed messages...      Yes, I'm sure all this makes him sound like a jerk of a guy, but he sincerely does not mean to hurt me..Which is part of what's confusing me. He treats me like I'm his GF for the most part....but when faced with the possible reality of it; won't admit it, or make it official.      I've never mentioned the idea of us dating because I figured that he needs time to heal after his last relationship.   But at the same time I feel like he just has his guard up and is making himself blind to what's going on around him. That he knows his kid sees me as a mother figure. And that (based upon his actions) he in fact might even have "feelings" for me that he denies to himself.   That he might not realize how he is hurting me - and possibly will hurt his child in the future.      So, if any one made it through all of that text....and could shed any light on what he may or may not think/feel or whatever..I would much appreciate it. Because I'm so confused.      I want him to want to be with me and me alone.   I want to be able to be a mother for his child.
20090225113040AAmsVYg	Social Science;Psychology	Worrying about stupid stuff?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

20090226152716AAHXW5b	Social Science;Psychology	I'm sick of life. And I am sick of people. Why?	It's my birthday today. 2/26. and this morning before school I felt very very depressed and angry for (NO) reason. I usualy am depressed over my dad being him but today I felt like killing someone. I started to cut my arm before school and went totally emo on myself. These are the things that I was thinking to myself.         1.Why wont my (so called) friends even give me the time of day when i ask them and just ignore me?      2.All I do is annoy people and cause pain.      3.I am not trying to cause pain but everyone seems to hate me for some reason.      4.DANG! I'm ugly and I only have one (TRUE) friend.      5. If one more person pisses me off I will hit them in the face.      So me and my TRUE friend both skiped the last two periods of school and hung out for awhile. I dod not care if the school called my dad. I did not even care that I was playing in traffic with my friend. I just wanted somebody to walk up and shoot me. Whats the point of living if you piss everyone off and you suck at everything in the world?      Why live watching people ease their way through school while you get f's when you try.      Why live when all people do is make fun of you, yell at you, and want to beat you up just because I'm ugly, white and skinny. I DON'T GET IT.

20090226151641AAsCxtL	Social Science;Anthropology	My difficulties with evolution.?	Evolution has pretty much been proven.  I can say I evolved from an animal and be content with that.  But, don't evolutionists believe that evolution was just a product of accidental changes in the genes?  This is pretty much the theory that Darwin states, where one particular animal develops something on accident that works better, and it lives and the rest die out over time.  Then how would you ever explain creatures evolving to fit its surroundings when needed most.  I just don't feel that millions of mistakes just happen to make the very thing needed for a creature to survive.  Can you honestly believe that a snake just started secreting venom by mistake because it couldn't kill it's prey?  You could tell me without a doubt, that a bird of prey developed good eyes in a region where it needed it most, so as to stay far enough away from the food to not scare it, lest the bird never hunts, and then dies?  If you can prove me wrong then so be it, but I'm tired of all of the people complaining there is nothing to life but mere accidents, when there is so much planned beauty around us.  I can understand evolution, but not the fact it is an accident.  Evolution has been proven in times where it has been needed, but mostly at these times, and these were changes directly linked to the problems at hand.

20090226150320AAGSBcH	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	2 things i want to ask...?	i tend to have very weird and horrific dreams so my first question is what does my dream mean? and if it could be considered a lucid dream?       At first, i was with my cousin and we were walking around in the basement. we felt as if we were being watched. then a little boy with a crazed look in his eyes and a horrible smile came outta nowhere. he started chasing us and every thing went blank for about 2 seconds. Next thing u now, my cousin disappears and im running in my back yard. I notice that some of my classmates were running from the crazy boy too. when i look back the crazy boy is on my porch and yells out to me and all of my classmates but i couldnt hear wat he was yelling. only silence came out of his mouth. my classmates around me had a look of horror on their faces. i was wondering why until the boy takes a beheaded head out of a cooler. the face was gruesome and the boys says something else but again silence comes out. like lightning the boy comes down from my porch and attacks and starts eating one of my classmates(actually the people that were my classmates looked different now) anyways, i had a feeling that if i ddnt sacrifice myself he wouldnt stop killing but i also had a feeling that even if i did, the boy wouldnt keep his promise and just kill everyone else. everyone was standing still, so i decided to run. i went into the woods and there was nowhere to run. i was so scared and started screaming for me to wake up. i started hitting myself but i felt nothing. just as i was about to go back for the boy to kill me, i remembered that people wake up from their dreams right before they die. so somehow i made one of the trees into a spike and suddenly the ground was lower so i could jump. so i jumped and the spike went through me. And wat do ya know i woke up before i hit the bottom. so basically i committed suicide in my dream.       so was that last part considered a lucid dream? since i did form my dream to kill myself to wake up? idk    please dont make fun of my weird dreams lol i swear im not crazy

20090226150543AAJAvXD	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a dream that a Baby Lions head was inside the mouth of a Big Lion?	The big lion would open his mouth and you could see the baby lion's head at the back. The big lion could only see/eat/roar when he opened his mouth as he did all this via the baby lion. (so his roar was really cute.) They animal was sitting on the reception of a nice resort at an island in the pacific - we drove there from qld? When I first saw the lion I was surprised and little scared, but it was so cute, and because the baby lion was the one that made all the noise I wasn't scared to put my hand in the big lions mouth and pat the baby one. You could feed it but it could only eat small amounts at one time as its mouth was soo small.      I know it is strange and I cant make any sense of it so if anyone has any thoughts I would love to hear them. Thanks

20090226152131AAFhhd3	Social Science;Psychology	Relationship/emotion question?	For a long time I was really into one of my good friends and often expressed those feelings towards her. She never said yes or no to me, which was slightly frustrating. I hated the mind games. We both have a lot of important things in common and even people that are very close to us agree that we'd make a good couple.      I finally came right out and had a one-on-one sit-down conversation about it with her and she concluded that at the moment she'd like to stay friends. That answer was just fine. Really, I just wanted a straight answer instead of all these ambiguous comments she was throwing around all of the time. I accepted what she wanted and moved on, even dated a few women since then. It has been roughly seven months since we had our conversation.      During these past seven months, my wounds have healed nicely and I've only talked to her occasionally. She works at a different place now and I've seen her maybe only four times out and about. We would always stop and talk for about ten minutes, catch up on the latest news (we have a lot of mutual friends and acquaintances), and so forth. The first three times I didn't really feel anything when I saw her, but this last time was different. All of the familiar feelings came back to me, although not as strongly as I remember it had been.       Truthfully, I have moved on but I suppose a tiny part of me will always want her. In all seriousness if she showed interest now I wouldn't reject it, but as of now I have very little interest in actually pursuing her at the moment. I suppose I'm sort of taking refuge in the comfort of "if it's meant to be". If it never happens, then great. If it does, that's even better.       So after this long-winded description of my situation, here is the real question. Is it normal to feel those emotions coming back when you see that person, even when you've moved on (or at least thought you've moved on)? I seriously thought I was done with her and felt really proud of myself for just letting it go. Now I'm second-guessing myself...

(it's in english)

20090226094227AAxCwMl	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why can't I find a single female-run granite fabrication and installation business?	I'm having some new granite installed and every single place is run by men. Obviously this isn't because women don't like granite countertops (they probably account for the vast majority of orders since women pretty much stay in the kitchen). So why are women too inept to run granite companies? Is it because of the large machinery or because of the heavy rocks?
