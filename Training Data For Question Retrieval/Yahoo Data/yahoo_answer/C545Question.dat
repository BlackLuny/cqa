20090304091322AAcPdJj	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	What is this?!? Please help!?	Over the past 2 or 3 years I have noticed that I occasionally get chest and arm pains. By occasionally I mean like they appear for about 5 seconds and then disappear and then come back like 5 minutes later.      Sometimes they are really painful and sometimes not. They can sometimes be sharp pains, that can go down either arm, but usually they are just general niggles that just make me really worried that it is to do with my heart.      I am only 14 years old and not paticularly overweight, and a lot of people have told me that, because of this, it is 99.9% chance not my heart. But I still get really anxious and worried.      A lot of the time I also feel nauseous and it can come on at any time, makng me feel really bad.      I also read somewhere that if you can't get an erection or something, it is sign of heart problems. I can get an erection though.      The thing that confuses me is that, last year, these pains nearly completely disappeared. I was still wary of them coming back but they didn't seem to, until a couple of months ago, when they came back.      I went to the Doctor about a month ago and told him about the pains. He used his stethescope, but that was it, and told me my heart sounded fine. Should he have done more? An EKG?      Please help. Any explanation to this would be greatly appreciated, I am really worried and anxious. I have told my parents but they don't seem too worried; they put it down to perhaps growing pains.      Should I go back to the Doctor? I don't know what to do!      Again, any help is greatly appreciated. In the mean-time, can anyone suggest some ways to calm my anxiety?      Thank you.      P.S. I also occasionally get this sort of bubbling feeling in my chest; like once a month. I've heard this could be something to do with my heart skipping beats?

Had them since second grade, I'm now 20. They bother me everyday of my life and I'm very self conscious about them. Would I call a dermatologist or plastic surgeon?

It's in the same area and size that Cindy Crawford has hers. Except mine is more 3D and I hate it.  It just has gotten bigger over the years and I'm afraid it will get even bigger as I get older.

Before I do it, I just want to know if anyone had done it on their face and what they're scars look like now if any at all.  Help I only have 3 hrs until I do it or decide to cancel.  Thanks!

From time to time I get problems with sciatica, sometimes this is painful in my lower back but more likely it causes sensations and discomfort in my legs.  At the moment the muscles in my left leg feel very weak, almost as if they cannot support me.  I am also getting some pins and needles in my one arm, which I guess is another tapped nerve.  I have seen an osteopath and he tends to sort me out but at a cost.  He believes it is the muscles which are tightening that is causing my problem.  What can I do on a daily basis to keep there muscles supple.  I have done the usual back exercises without much relief.      Also when I take ibuprofen,  does this just mask the pain or does the anti inflammatory help to cure the problem.      Ta!

Gnats,mosquito's and especially no-see-um's come right to me for feeding. They lock-onto me and follow me with single-minded purpose, regardless of my attempts to shoo them away. I bathe every day and i'm care full to change-up the soaps,shampoos and laundry detergents to eliminate the perfumes,( that many of these products contain), as the culprits. Nothing I've done grants me more than a couple hours of relief. I've come to believe that my perspiration is the source of my dilemma, and due to my diet, is acidic in nature. Acid,as I understand-it, is sweet to the insects olfactory detection sensors, and is the major instinct they react to,to pursue me as tasty food. A'm I wrong? This is my hypothysis,after years of frustration and eventual depression. What say you?

20090304102419AARA60Q	Health;Men's Health	It burns when I pee.. what is it?	Well, actually it 'burnt' when I pee. Now I'm fine.  but about 6 days ago (for about two days) I noticed it burnt alittle when I peed. The urine didn't smell unusual, there were no discharges, nothing.. just a slight burn. The following evening I went to a really shitty clinic. Told him it burnt alittle. He made me pee in a cup and then walked away (doctor). He came back and said "seems to be fine .. not sure what it is. I'll be right back". He walked into another doctors office and closed the door. I was 5 feet from it and I heard them trying to figure out possibilities. He came back and walked back to the urine sample and then came back to me and said "it turned cloudy so we're going to give you an antibiotic, but It's odd for a 21 year old male to get a Urinary Tract Infection. So we're going to do a lab culture (swab the inside of my penis) to test for Chlamydia.        I had sex with a girl about 11-12 months ago, intercourse once (without a condom) and oral about 4-5 times.       Could I have contracted Chlamydia almost a year ago and just NOW started to feel a burning sensation and no other symptoms? I was prescribed doxycycline and have been taking it for almost 6 days now. Also, if they did a lab culture 5 days ago, shouldn't the results have been in by now?

This will last from what i can tell  for hours to days. I just get moody and hard to deal with. This has killed relationships that probably should have worked out. I have a really good girlfriend who loves sex but doesn't like how I get if i get too much. Morning sex is out of the question now because she doesn't want to deal with me all day. Looking at the stereotype i thought guys were supposed to be easy going and relaxed after sex, not the opposite. Is this some sort of hormone problem that could be fixed?

I was thinking of going on a liquid-fast for as long as my body would let me, but after three days i was getting SERIOUSLY worried about my metabolism!      I want to try and lose weight a healthier way. (And if it doesn't work, I want to try this 2468 ana diet - 200 cals one day, then 400, 600, 800, and then back to 200. The severe change between 800 and 200 is supposed to seriously boost the metabolism? Is this true?)      I've read that certain foods can help boost. What foods?      And are there any exercises that specificly boost the metabolism??      I know and understand how the 5 small meals a day works, but I just can't do that. I can't eat 5 meals. I will feel super bloated - I am almost never hungry (which is why I got to 3 days without food without it being too hard). Maybe one meal a day is good enough for me. I really will function decently throughout the day on just one meal instead of 3 (or 5), I've tried and tested it out myself.      I have a tredmill in my house and I use it amost every day for at least 30 minutes, either in a slow jog or a fast walk.         Also -  I know muscles can boost the metabolism, help me out with exercises for this, too. I wan specific things, and also, I would like to tone up my legs and butt, and flatten my stomach.

Anyway I don't know what type of filling they put in but it is wearing down and I can see some silver that looks like they put underneath the filling.

Obviously it hasnt caused me to loose weight because I've been consuming tons of calories through the drinks and the pop and stuff, but my question is not how bad is it to drink but how bad is it to not eat if Im getting how many calories I should.

When reading posts about people who got their cured with topical or/and oral medications, I always wonder how SEVERE their fungus really was. I don't usually see pictures - before and after.       What I am very interested in knowing is THIS - Are there any people at all who have had it so severe as mine and gotten it cured? And how? I'm not interested in just the general information about treatments as I'm aware of them all, I just want to know if someone with my severity has been successfully cured/treated and how.      I am attaching a couple of links to picture of my toenails for you to see. The toenails are clipped as short as possible. Any dark marks are from bleeding. The left big toe will bleed and hurts terribly if I cut it any further.       http://i394.photobucket.com/albums/pp28/...        http://i394.photobucket.com/albums/pp28/...       I am thinking of trying topical (listerine/vinegar soak daily), plus oregano oil topical treatment 2xs/day as well as taking oregano oil orally. But if there is no chance it will work because it's so bad, then I don't want to waste my time and money and just try to accept it. The thing is, I just can't seem to accept it. I just want to be able to show my feet and not hide them for once in my life. I've tried topical solutions in the past to no avail. Lamisal concerns me because of the potential liver risks and expense.  I've thought of toenail removal, but that is my last resort.       I am 33 yrs old (female) and I can't remember a time I could wear sandals or go swimming without being terribly embarrassed - now I don't show them anymore.      Thank you for your time!

I am a big coffee drinker also. Love love love salt! I am about 30 pounds overweight (I know..). We eat a lot of meat/game. Okay-rednecks!     I was recently diagnosed with high blood presssure and the doctor told me to:     Quit smoking, caffeine, alcohol, salt. Eat a vegetarian diet, no meat. Lose weight. Excercise daily, reduce stress.       Just like that-so non-chalant about it!   Sounds ideal but who realistically can do it all at once?  I certainly understand the quit smoking.  I thought I'd START with that!   I am on the patch and haven't smoked in 2 weeks. I have gained 8 pounds.   I honestly don't know how he expects me to quit smoking  AND lose weight at same time!  No coffee, no beer, no cigarettes, no meat,or salt-but reduce your stress!  I think he is expecting way too much at one time.  I am crawling out of my skin! A cup of coffee and a cigarette WERE my de-stressors. Has anyone ever made such a radical change-just like that?  How did you do it? I am happy just to be off the smoking-I figured I'd worry about the weight gain once I was over the cigarettes.  I see doctor next week. how can I tell him that all these changes at once are stressing me out? Bad enough I gained when he said to lose!  Any suggestions?

I immediatly went over to it and observed that it was a fresh bloody, walnut sized, mass of mucusy skin with tiny blood clots attached. It was a normal colour of skin although like i said, covered with clots and blood. I freaked out, picked it up and was so confused as to waht the heck this was!?

I have had them for about 4 months and they won't go away, they all itch still and don't look good. They are not scars but still scabs. I also have a neat circle of them on the top of my foot which at 1st I thought was ring worm but have since found out that its not, my doctor told me its nothing but I can't believe that its nothing!! One of the scabs is from a bite I got in Mexico and that goes from a scar to a scab all the time and I have had that for about 18months now!!! Please help me figure out what this is!!! Oh and I am fit, healthy and have never had any bad illness or disease!!!

But from the past week, I am experiencing terrible headaches at the back of my head and at the top of my head after wearing spectacles.   I found out that if I don't wear spectacles, I wouldn't get any pain. Its only after wearing specs for more than half an hour, I would get headaches.       Can someone please tell me why is this happening because I don't think my power has either decreased or increased. But I can say for sure that I have power because without wearing specs I can't make out clearly what is written on the Blackboard in the classroom. After wearing the specs it becomes crystal clear. So, the power has neither increased nor decreased.       Please help me out because these headaches are spoiling my day both at the college and at home.

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

I used to go out, drink, and get drunk all the time with my buddies and just have a blast. Going to bars, clubs, and enjoying the night out. Now that I'm older, being 29 with a college degree, working in the corporate office, and making a good living ... I just don't feel the need to go out as much anymore. I really don't care about going to rock shows anymore. I still like to drink, but I just drink occasionally just for a good buzz, but never get drunk anymore. Most of my friends who I knew when I was younger are still doing the same thing, still living with roommates, and getting drunk all the time. I just don't feel the need to do that anymore.

20090227062655AAKCQsV	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	If someone with SEVERE toenail fungus has been successfully treated, I would LOVE to hear from u!?	When reading posts about people who got their cured with topical or/and oral medications, I always wonder how  SEVERE their fungus really was. I don't usually see pictures - before and after.        What I am very interested in knowing is THIS - Are there any people at all who have had it so severe as mine and gotten it cured? And how? I'm not interested in just the general information about treatments as I'm aware of them all, I just want to know if someone with my severity has been successfully cured/treated and how.       I am attaching a couple of links to picture of my toenails for you to see. The toenails are clipped as short as possible. Any dark marks are from bleeding. The left big toe will bleed and hurts terribly if I cut it any further.        http://i394.photobucket.com/albums/pp28/...        http://i394.photobucket.com/albums/pp28/...       I am thinking of trying topical (listerine/vinegar soak daily), plus oregano oil topical treatment 2xs/day as well as taking oregano oil orally. But if there is no chance it will work because it's so bad, then I don't want to waste my time and money and just try to accept it. The thing is, I just can't seem to accept it. I just want to be able to show my feet and not hide them for once in my life. I've tried topical solutions in the past to no avail. Lamisal concerns me because of the potential liver risks and expense.  I've thought of toenail removal, but that is my last resort.        I am 33 yrs old (female) and I can't remember a time I could wear sandals or go swimming without being terribly embarrassed - now I don't show them anymore.       Thank you for your time!

20090304093043AADRKLg	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Alternative strength training exercises while injured?	Last Monday I pulled my right latissimus dorsi muscle doing deadlifts. I didn't think anything of it, and continued training. A week later my back still hurt quite a bit, and I had also developed a strange shooting pain down my right leg.       I went to the doctor and he told me that I needed to take at least two weeks off of lifting weights. The back pain was likely just a pulled muscle that kept getting aggravated by continuing to work out, and my sciatic nerve was probably responsible for the shooting pain down my leg, which I may have damaged doing squats with too much weight on the bar.       He scheduled me for four electro-therapy sessions to help with this. My questions are, are the electro-therapy sessions really necessary? I know they're doctor recommended, but the pain isn't intense and I can walk around just fine. I can't run right now, but that's partially also due to my back. Also, I would like to continue training while injured. Are there any exercises that don't use the muscles I've injured, because it seems like any lift I do, from bicep curls to bench presses, seems to aggravate the problem. If not, I'll just take my losses and stay in bed for a couple weeks, but could I at least get some pushups or something in?

20090227063045AAUyK12	Health;Women's Health	Yeast Infection Question?	A month ago, I had an epic yeast infection that responded not at all to home remedies. I finally used Miconazole and it still didn't clear it up as far as I could tell. I then went to the gynocologist, and she took a look, and said there were still tiny traces of yeast.She said it should clear itself up but gave me clomitrozole as well. I used it for 4 days then had my period and when my period was finished I finished the tube (she said that should work). Now, while I don't have itching and burning down there, I have thick cakey discharge that clings to my labia.It's very frustrating because it makes it really hard for me to get lubricated when sexually aroused. Is this a yeast infection still? Do I need to get ANOTHER kind of anti-fungal?

20090304082716AAHZVAa	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Common Cold? Or something serious?	Saturday, 5 days ago, I started with that sick feeling like I knew I was getting something. I went on with my day tho and took zicam that didnt help. Sunday morning I woke up with a bad sore throat. I thought it was because the dry air in my room and it was dusty so I cleaned everything and went on with my day drinking orange juice and taking vitamins. At night I went to bed and woke up like 2 hours after trembling I was freezingggg and I took my temperature and I had a 101 fever. I was shaking so bad I couldnt even hold a cup. I put on a sweater and sweat pants and took some tylenol and the fever completely went away and I went back to sleep waking up in the middle of the night again cuz now I was hot from the sweater. The tylenol worked. Monday, I still had sore throat and at night I developed a dry cough which hurt cuz my throat hurt so bad and my nose begin to get stuffy. But no fever the whole day and night. I took some thera flu and fell asleep. I woke up Tuesday (Yesterday) with my throat feeling worse but I think its cuz I couldnt breathe through my nose and I sleep with my mouth open snoring. As soon as I drink water My throat feels better. definitely not gone still pain but much better then when I first wake up. I still felt achey tho. My nose is stuffed no mucus comes out I couldnt even blow it out its just stuffed. Went thru the whole day yesterday feeling a lil tiny bit better. Rested all day again. Then night time I layed down and watch TV at like 11pm I stayed up till 5am. At 3am I started to feel warm I took my temperature and I had a 99.1 I took some thera flu and went to bed. I slept 5 hours and today I wake up to this pain in my chest that hurts everytime I move and I still have sore throat. My nose is cleared up tho and my body feels better. I have been eating normal I only went one day not hungry. Every other day including last night I was extrememly starving. SO my appetite is still here. The lil fever last night and the chest pain this morning is a lil worrying tho. I feel like I wasnt breathing right in my sleep and it maybe caused this pain. I feel a lil better overall tho still have sore throat and the sick feeling and a cough but my body feels better but my chest pain is there. Is it just a common cold? Since I dont have green mucus and blood and all that or should I go to the doctor even tho I feel like my nose is unclogged and i can breathe. The pain in my chest tho feels like something is damaged. could it be a muscle from sleeping the wrong way or it hurts from breathing wrong in my sleep. Like now when i take a breath in and cough it hurts..please help

20090304082853AA4GFv8	Health;Other - Health	Correcting errors in medical records?	I recently applied for health insurance & the insurance company obtained medical records from my doctor and then declined my application because of some medical conditions found in the med. record. Those were conditions that I'd never had, never was treated for & was shocked to learn that they were present in my med. record. Talked with the doc. about them :- She said the conditions were her inference based on the conversation she had with me during my office visit, but she had never mentioned that to me during my office visit (matter of fact, I went to her office for routine physicals) and had never advised any treatment for any of those conditions. And, I know for a fact that I do not have those conditions. I tried to get her to correct my records but she did not agree to remove those conditions from my records.      I'm not even bothered about my med. insurance at this point, I'd like to have my medical records corrected and also take legal action against the doctor.       I'd appreciate opinions and suggestions on this matter and would also like to know if anyone has had similar experience and how they fixed it.

My dentist is an in-network provider of both plans. I wonder which fee schedule should she be based on? The primary or the loweres one?      For example, I need to do an onlay. The primary plan covers 50% of $1000 while the second plan covers 50% of $700.  The way it works in this office is that I pay 50% of what they charge first and they file a claim to my primary insurance company. Once the EOB from the primary company is available, I will have to file a claim to the second insruance company for the remaining balance. Since my doctor is in both networks, should I pay 50% of $1000 or 50% of $700 the first time?

I started at 215lbs which was a little plump. My wife went to a few meetings a year or so back and got the book and the calculator but then stopped going. I have always used what I call the "Push the Plate" diet. Meaning don't eat so dang much. I do eat a certain amount everyday but I know what my food point values are so I really just eat. I am getting ready to start back at the gym and wanted to know your opinions on how I should re-figure my eating habits. Meaning since I will burning more how do I make up for this since I am on a points system. I currently eat 24 points daily and never use any of the Flex Points. Never have, maybe as far as the daily intake goes but not for the week. I've read where this diet makes you loose muscle mass as well so if I up my protein intake should I up my points as well or just substitute my other foods with my protein?

20090304083815AAgQmBu	Health;Diet & Fitness	Diet soda and excess abdominal fat?	I'm a 5'6", 21 year old male who weighs about 121 lbs on average.       For the past 4 years now, as I can remember, I've consumed about 3 diet soft drinks on average - rarely if ever a real high-fructose corn syrup soft drink - just diet. My drink of choice is typically diet coke.      I'm a vegetarian as well, and have been for the past four years.      Despite my small frame and skinny build at just 121 lbs, I find that while the rest of my body does not have much, if any excess fat, my abdomen does, noticeably (especially when I retain water). I've been trying to pin point this cause as I've read it can be related to an increased risk of heart disease, and a lot of people are saying that high abdominal fat can be related to the chemical processes in diet soda.      This seemed slightly out of left field - I knew it wasn't good for you by any means, but I didn't think it would cause this type of problem.      Does anyone know if this is true, and if so, why this is true that soda/diet soda would cause abdominal weight? As of right now, I'm willing to pilot giving it up altogether for a few weeks and seeing how my body reacts.       It's really my only vice - my diet is very vitamin, protein, and fiber rich with very little cholesterol.      Thanks!

Mall? Drugstore? Or would it be a bad idea to rush these things?

20090304094457AAdXwOK	Health;Optical	Can an Eye doctor be wrong with a diagnosis?	We just found out that our 5 year old needs glasses. We were told she has really bad eyes. We did two tests. The first test, the Dr. said it is fixable over time. The second test, Dr. said its worst then she thought. Now she needs to wear glasses all the time. My question is can the Doctor be wrong? I tested my daughter at home and her school did too. Everything seems fine. The only problems shes been having is some headaches (here and there not too many) Doctor says shes 20/50 & 20/70. I'm not sure if that's really all that bad, people just seem shocked when they hear those numbers and they ask why it wasn't a problem for her before. I have already spent $150 on glasses for her (we dont have yet) I don't know, If anyone can help.

My last tests were about 4 years ago, but I am now experiencing hives and I think my allergies may have changed because I am careful about what I consume.      Previously, I had the skin tests where they put the drop of allergen on your arm and scratch the skin to see if you react.   I am sure they will probably do the same test again, but I was reading that there are now blood tests that can also check for food allergies.      I was wondering if anyone has had the blood tests done and if they showed an allergy to something that hadn't shown up with the skin test???      I would appreciate any info anyone can give me on their allergy testing experience.

My work has been extremely stressful lately, I am getting married in August, I'm struggling to organize my finances, and I started on birth control which messed up my hormones.  I have moments where my whole body tenses up and I squeeze everything because I'm so frustrated.  I keep thinking negative thoughts about everything and it makes me want to quit my job and just die.  I love my fiance and I don't want to be so crazy when we are married.  This all started in November but became extreme this last month. I can't decide if it was the pill messing up my hormones or just me being stressed out.  I started the 'reminder' pill this week and yesterday I felt really good, but today I feel horrible again and it seems to be the same as it was during the weeks of taking the actual pill.  Why am I so stressed all the time?  I can't keep my mind straight or focus on anything.

20090304101958AAY3Tgc	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Low blood sugar? What is happening to me?	OK, I am hoping I can get an MD, nurse or someone with diabetes to answer this.       Whenever I eat or drink something high in sugar or refined carbs (and lower in fat or protein) I end up feeling like I'm going to pass out about 2 or 3 hours later.       I know this is because my blood sugar most likely spikes and then falls, which is what leaves me feeling like that. I get sweaty, panicky, heart racing, lightheaded and just feel like I'm going to faint. I have an urge at this point to eat more carbs/sugar- which is probably a natural response to up my falling blood glucose.       My question, though, is this. I'm overweight and have no symptoms of type 2 diabetes. No frequent urination, thirst, weight loss, tingly limbs, etc. I would be less surprised, though, if I were having those symptoms, seeing as to how I beleive I'd be a better candidate for type 2 than hypoglycemia.  Obviously, I have a problem regulating my insulin/sugar levels. Am I overproducing insulin? Is this a symptom of oncoming diabetes? This is happening to me more frequently, and is alleviated when I drink or eat low sugar products. I know how to alleviate it, I'm just curious what underlying cause there is.       The older I get, the faster this happens. I had to switch to sugar free when I order my decaf latte in the mornings because of it. I just can't handle the sugar.       Can someone help me clear this up? Is this normal or am I going nuts?

20090304095057AApJlhS	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Rolled ankle...   need some advice!!!?	I rolled my ankle 5 days ago, and as they all do, it swelled and bruised.  5 days on, most of the swelling has subsided, and I can walk on it without limping, although there is still a little bit of tenderness when i DO walk on it.  There is also some bruising along the bottom edge of my foot.   I have a bmx competition in just over a week, and I want to get my foot as good as it can be for then.  I started doing stretching and strengthening exercises today, and I'm still applying ice a few times a day, and keeping it wrapped tight and elevated as much as possible, only leaving it un-bandaged at night when I sleep.   I figue that if I can walk on it already, it can't be a severe injury, so I'm hoping that if I keep treating it like I have been, it will be well enough to compete in my competition next weekend.   Given that it's only been 5 days, and that I can walk on it, and that the swelling has gone, could I be ok in 7 dyas from now..??  I'm not expecting to be fully healed, but, I'm hoping to be able to put it under a little bit of stress.  There is no impact on my joint in my sport, by the way. I do Flatland BMX, so I am only standing on the pegs or pegs on my bike, while I do tricks, so it won't stress my ankle too much.  It is the 3rd stop in a National Series, and I'm leading the series, so I really want to compete to stay on top.     Thanks in advance :)

Here are the symptoms I read about          *  Pain in the joint when you are active, especially as you push-off on the toes when you walk          * Swelling around the joint          * A bump, like a bunion or callus, that develops on the top of the foot          * Stiffness in the great toe and an inability to bend it up or down      I have only the first symptom, my right big toe hurts sometimes when I take a step, only at a certain angle.

It's so bad that I keep crackers, a bottle of water, and naproxen in my nightstand. When I wake up with cramps I take a naproxen, eat 4-5 crackers, and drink half a bottle of water.

I've tried birth control, and the cramps weren't as bad, but I ended up getting morning sickness other times of the month, so it just didn't work.      I'll be leaving for basic training soon and I know I won't be able to go through my normal routine to deal with my cramps. What can I do to to make sure all of this won't be a problem at basic?

20090304111312AAd7ZVu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Skin sensitive to touch.  Feels like sunburn?	Let me explain my circumstances:   I had a common cold at the beginning of February.  All of the cold symptoms went away except for the cough.  The cough stayed with me off and on for the whole month of February with some yellow mucus coming up.  I went to the doctor this past Saturday and he told me it was a sinus infection and gave me doxycycline hyclate 100mg tablets (twice daily).  I have been taking this medication since Saturday.  I have also been taking OTC cough medicine, tylenol, and advil.  The day after I went to the doctor (Sunday), I had a cold "relapse".  I had a fever ranging from 99-102 from Sunday to Monday night and felt very achy and tired.  The cold/flu-like symptoms ended completely Tuesday afternoon, except I still have the cough that has been pestering me for the last month.      Here is my problem now.  Since Monday when I had the cold "relapse", my skin has been very sensitive.  It feels like a sunburn when I touch it or even when clothing rubs against it.  The bad areas are my whole back, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  There are no visible marks, rashes, lesions, or anything else.      I was wondering if this had anything to do with the doxycycline, because I know that is also used to treat skin conditions such as acne.  If it is not because of the medication, is there another explanation as why my skin would be so sensitive??      Thanks for any help you can provide and I can provide any more details if you need them.

20090304112217AArZ9e8	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	How long will this tonsillectomy recovery take?	I'm fifteen & I had my tonsils taken out 6 days ago. The first few days went really well, other than me throwing up a few times when I came home. I had pain, but my pain medicine took care of it. I was drinking a lot, and eating well. I was able to have bread & hot dogs with minimal pain. But on about the fourth day, I had an allergic reaction to my Loritab. It was still helping the pain but it made me very nauseous & it felt like I had bugs crawling all over my skin. The next morning we were able to switch my medication to Tylenol with codeine, and that worked for about a day. But around 7:00 last night, my pain medicine stopped working. It would last only a half hour, & then i would be in horrible pain. I tried alternating the Tylenol with the Loritab, and the doctor said I could take them every two hours, but there was no improvement. All that did was make me dizzy, nauseous, & still in horrible pain. I spent all night in agony. I would be awake until I could take my pain medicine again, doze off for the short amount of time it worked, & wake up with tears streaming down my face & lie awake in horrible pain for hours. This morning I got my medicine switched again to Darvocet, & like both other medicines before, it's working alright, though making me very dizzy and nauseous. I'm just very afraid that it will stop working like the other medications have. & I don't understand why I would be doing so well, & suddenly have things turn horrible! Even on my medication, i can barely swallow, let alone eat or drink. If anyone has had a similar experience, or any tips or advice, PLEASE share them with me-I'm desperate. This is by far the WORST thing I have ever experienced. Any advice would be much appreciated.

If it were oral thrush caused by the medicine, why didn't it present itself early, when i was still on it, and  it also feels like there is something stuck in my throat or tongue. Could this be a symptom of oral thrush. I googled around, and noticed that oral thrush can be an early symptom of HIV.

I have a three year old son that has not potty trained yet and tends to have tantrums that I believe are due to a language barrier since he doesn't talk much yet.

Now if my son has autism, that's something I can deal with but he doesn't show signs like repetitive behaviors or lack of cuddling, etc. My OTHER son also had delayed speech and everyone told me he was autistic. Now he's gotten older he's one of the most empathetic children a mother could ask for. I'd like to learn more from parents here and medical professionals regarding this to tell me if it sounds like autism to you, or perhaps just speech delay.

20090304115045AAbnYtd	Health;Mental Health	Is my mum an alcoholic?	She's been hiding bottles (empty and full) of wine and spirits such as vodka and whiskey in her study.   I also have noticed that it looks like she's drinking water, but when she leaves the room, i smell the drink and its clearly vodka.    I'm worried about her, as I think she's very stressed/depressed and know that she's been taking st johns wort (an anti depressant).   Is she just enjoying a drink or is she an alcoholic?    And what should I do?   xxxxxxx
20090304115552AAJSToY	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Why does my ear pop every time i swallow?	Everytime i swallow ( not swallow anything but just swallow in general ) My ear pops and it is very painful? I don't really have earache, until i swallow of course. It has been doing this all day and becomes quite painful if i talk loudly or shout and lean my head to the side of my sore ear??      What is wrong with it, is it just an ear infection or something else? Bear in mind i have had quite a few ear infections and this does not feel like that sort of pain?      Thanks all xx

20090304120456AAZ9o0v	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is there any other reason why this would happen to someone?	I’m 16 years old and a couple of weeks ago, something really weird happened.      Ok, so me and my 17 year old sister were smoking hookah, and we smoked for about an hour, and my head started to hurt like hell.   Usually when I smoke, my head doesn’t hurt, but I figured it was because of my diet.      I hadn’t eaten anything that day, or the day before or the day before that except 2 cups of coffee.      Anyhow, so I decided I’d take a bath because I figured the headache would leave.      So I let the water run, and I opened the heat in my house, and after about 20 minutes I returned to the bathroom.      As I was about to close the door, I realized I couldn’t see anything, everything was a blur, I dropped to the floor and I began to shake like crazy for about 3 minutes.   I felt like vomiting but  I didn’t.   I couldn’t get up or get myself to scream for help. I had no power in me.      Anyways it all went away after a few minutes and I got up, and washed my face and fell into bed to sleep.      I think this happened because of  the combination of not eating, smoking, and hotness from the heat.      Any other possibilities? Any other reason why someone would drop to the floor and shake?

20090304121613AAtMJd6	Health;Men's Health	Have muscle men gone out of style, should I bulk up or stay thin?	I just lost 25 pounds from dieting, but I lost lots of muscle too because I stopped lifting weights during this period as well.  So now I'm really lean with a six pack.        I feel good about my body, but I'm also a little insecure because I'm not bulky anymore.  I've done steroids before, but only winstrol (which adds more strength than size) because I didn't want to get too huge.  Now I'm thinking about doing the hard stuff like deca.        But every time I look at tv or magazines, most of the "sexy" guys are thin and toned like Jude Law or Smith Jared from Sex and the City.  The bulky guys are in the minority like The Rock and LL Cool J.        Another thing I'm insecure about is my finances.  I'm 25 and was doing good selling cars and insurance until the recession.  Now I'm just a security guard at a club, and I'm back with my parents.  So that makes me feel like I need to have big muscles again to make up for being broke.      So should I remain lean and chiseled or go for the size.  I'm 6'4 by the way.

20090304121154AAIIzhN	Health;Mental Health	Could this be schizophrenia?	I have a friend who i know full well is mentally ill. She is diagnosed as BI-polar but i think their is more. She doesn't tell her psychiatrist somethings which she tells me. first she started telling me that their were cats outside her window that watch. she also today was telling me about the woman that only she can see and talk to. she often giggles to herself but refuses to tell her psychiatrist because she believes that the woman is her friend. I think this could well be schizophrenia but i do not know enough about it to conclude. does this sound like typical symptoms of schizophrenia and if not what else could it be? cheers =]
