20090128115634AADQ34w	Pets;Dogs	Puppy whimpers a lot and I can't figure out why?	I have a 4 month old pug that I got from my dad. (He breeds them) The puppy is paper trained, we don't put her in a crate, I hardly ever leave the house and if I do she's behaved enough that I don't have to lock her up. She's friendly and hyper like a normal puppy but the last few days she's begun to whimper a lot. She'll be chewing on a toy and whimpering the whole time she's doing it. It doesn't make any sense. She whimpers when I play with her too.       On top of that she gags a lot. At least 6 times a day she throws up in her mouth and then swallows it. (At least thats what it sounds like she's doing) and she gags twice that much. I've owned dogs before and I know they gag but never this much!

She has been ridden previously by a 13yr old girl who has a "yee haw" attitude and she has used spurs and a tie-down attached to a bozel/bridle combination.  The mare now has a large muscle built up on her bottom neck line rather than along the topline.  When I try to bring her onto the bit she sticks her nose up and tosses her head, I ride with a very gentle steady hand and no artifical aids what so ever.

20090225125445AAoljso	Pets;Cats	Bringing my girl to the vet tomorrow?	My baby-girl Ziggy is going to the vet tomorrow at 11a.m.!  She's got two bumps on her shoulder (they feel like they're connected).  They're probably a little smaller than the size of a pea.  When I touch it it feels like cartilage.  It doesn't seem to hurt her because when I touch it she doesn't even flinch.   So weird.. so im taking her to get it checked out!  Any ideas what it could possibly be?      Also, she's been developing black spots on her gums/nose/eyelids - My last vet told me that it was nothing to worry about.  I did research on it a few months ago and it said that it is completely normal for orange tabby's to develop these (but in VERY rare cases it could be cancer.. pray for her)!  Anyone ever have this checked out or hear of it?      I also just switched to another vet, i wasnt fond of how she handled things.. (she basically told me to declaw my cat)  And thats the last time she heard from me!       - and the last time she had her rabies shot was about 2 years ago.  She's 3 years old.  Should I get it for her again tomorrow?  She's an indoor cat and spayed.  She's been checked for FIV and leukemia - all is negative.

Okay I'm really scared right now because my dog's poop just had blood in it....I'm almost certain it isn't parvo because he's already had it and fought past it.

Also, he is a Cryptorchid, I dunno if that has anything to do with it....just please someone help me!

20090225125112AAC1fN4	Pets;Dogs	Is it too quick to suspect my dog is pregnant? Or is it a false pregnancy?	I have a female Pomeranian Shih Tzu mix and a male purebred Shih Tzu. My female was in heat about 2 weeks ago. It seemed to be a very short heat cycle and it was her first cycle because she’s only a year. Well my male shih tzu has always tried to hump her and she refused but just near the end of her very short cycle she finally allowed him to do so. They locked on February 8th and then they locked again the very next day! It’s been 2 weeks since the mating occurred. My female dog has been looking like she’s putting on weight and her nipples are bigger and there is a lump underneath them. I’ve been calling the vet and doing as much research as possible about pregnancy and dogs because I plan to have a career in the veterinarian field. I’m just a little confused about her being pregnant or experiencing a false pregnancy. It’s only been 2 weeks. Is it too soon for signs like bigger nipples, sleeping a lot, laziness, and slightly bigger belly? Please answer this and tell me what you guys think. Thank you so much!!                  ^^^^^ alot of poeple have been saying im a mean person and dumb person because my animals bred together. well it wasnt a planned pregnancy. dogs and dogs not humans. they dont always know whats best for them. there is no way i would ever hurt my dogs or harm her puppies. i know shes a little too young but im not an animal killer im not getting them aborted i love my dogs very much. and i dont think her pups are going to be abanded or neglected there for family members not for people in the paper. ive bought from people in the paper thats where the dad and mom are from i know the problems that come along with that and im gonna make sure her pups are safe and loved with people i know and trust.         thank you very much!!!

20090128095924AAYhibn	Pets;Horses	Reining conformation?	I'm going to train my almost 5-year-old mare for reining. She's very calm, smart, and obedient. I've started her on leg yielding and sliding stops, but she's only in the beginning stages.      I read that these are things a horse needs conformationally to excel in reining:      1. Low head carriage.   2. Straight legs for soundness.   3. Good pasterns for soundness and way of moving.   4. Overall balance.   5. Sloping shoulder.   6. Strong hindquarters.       I'm working on number 6, and number 5 isn't great at the moment ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  but I'm hoping to improve her balance by taking her reining training very slowly. That isn't conformational, anyway.      But what are your opinions about the rest?         Here are some pictures:    http://www.flickr.com/photos/cloudsmysti...       (They go from oldest to newest)

20090225130311AA5mAqW	Pets;Cats	Does anyone know about the law and cat rescue homes?	I got my cat from a rescue home last october but i think my daughter is allergic to her. I'm going to leave it a few weeks to be sure. When I took the cat I had to sign something to say if I couldn't keep her then I would return her to the same place. However, that place was horrible, it was a lady's house that works for the rescue home and there were about 30 cats all over the surfaces and the smell was unbearable. It has taken me this long to get the cat healthy! I have grown very attached to the cat and if she really has to go I don't want her going back there but because I signed that thing, could I get into trouble if I took her to a nicer place like RSPCA or cats protection league?
20090128100149AA0mD8n	Pets;Birds	Weird lovebird behavior... Please help!?	I bought a lovebird from a lady at a fare and brought him or her home.  The bird is not tame so I am not able to pick him or her up but I talk to him or her and she/he listens.  Just recently, I read online that lovebirds can get lonely if no attention is given to them.  I decided to get him/her a partner and found a lady who was giving her female lovebird named peaches away and thought that would be a perfect partner for my bird.  Now these are the weird behaviors I am getting from these birds:    Peaches actually was bred once and per her previous owners, thats why she bites.  But she also fed my other bird as if the other bird was a baby bird.  Then they get along and then they fight.  They dont tear out feathers but it seems like they get jealous of the attention given to one but peaches seems to be more aggressive then the day I got her.    My bird "Blue" rips the paper from the cage and dips it in water and then eats it. Why does he eat it? Whats with this weird behavior?    If someone can tell me why these birds are this way or maybe enlighten whats with the weird behavior, I would greatly appreciate it.  Please help me understand my birds.
20090225125949AAtKEgd	Pets;Rodents	My guinea pig is motionless.  What's wrong with her?	About 5 days ago we started breeding her with one of our boy g. pigs.  Yesterday she started rolling over and over in the cage and then stopped, on her side, and sort of had some seizure movements.     Today she was laying very still on her side, and when my boyfriend picked her up she was wet all over her bottom and had some blood coming out.     She won't move...looks like she might be dying.  Could this already be due to a miscarriage, or what could be going on?

We took our pets to Dr.Smith's but the doesn't show any emotion and it's kinda creepy. We then started taking them to Dr. Drummond's in New Bethlehem and he shows emotion but doesn't seem to know what he's doing. He told us last time that my cat needs to be put down because she's losing weight and that's not normal, I said that last time he told us it was because she's old, and he was like "oh she's old?" as he was looking at her file. And he said that my cats odor was normal(I posted a question a few minutes ago about that) and I didn't believe it was. So Does any one know of any one else around here that I can go to?

20090128084513AAVgMrg	Pets;Fish	What are reasons for a cloudy tank?	Hi!  I have a 20 gallon tank with a plecostomus, a bala, and 5 mollies.  I cleaned it real well the other day...did my chemicals...salt etc.  New filter...got dirty quick...rinsed, used again, then put in new one.  Filter is not getting dirty any more.  Yuck settled and Pleco cleaned it up.  For one day it was SOOOOO clear.  Then it has been cloudy since.   I know I tend to over feed and that could be it...I have been watching that.  What are other reasons that would keep it a little cloudy?  I do usually use one more chemical that is to keep it from being cloudy but I ran out of that.  I used a water neutralizer with clear water help in that.  Just wondering if there is other common sense reasons I am missing!  Thanx so much in advance!

I've had a 10 gal freshwater tank for 8 years now, it has a few guppies, 2 cory catfish & 2 ghost glass catfish, where I live we have very hard water, the calcium is visible on the fish tank lid/filter. I did a partial water change, like I have been for years, did that 2 days ago, and the water is the very cloudy. I've never seen it this bad. My friend owns a fish store and gave me a Wonder Shell to put in there, it hasn't done anything yet, it's still very cloudy. I have the bio wheel as well, and it's a 20 gal filter. I did put the water conditioner in it to make the tap water safe. I'm just annoyed that last week it was CRYSTAL clear, you couldn't even tell there was water in this tank, that's how clear it was. Now, it's white cloudy colored, and it seems to be more in the middle of the tank and the top. Towards the bottom it's a little clear.   Can someone please help me and let me know what I need to do? Or why it's doing this?   Thanks in advance for all your help!

They wanted to do a biopsy and more then likey radiation. We simply can't afford any of that. The lump seems tobe growing rapidly and is now the size of a football, not exexaggeratingIt doesn't seem to bother him too much; he itches it often and it seems to drain his energy.

So my cat got neutered about 10 days ago, and he hasn't been eating or drinking barely at all. I always feed him dry food, and only wet once in a while as a treat. So yesterday i went out and bought him wet to see if he would eat, and he ate it all. I just gave him another can and he finished it quickly again. My question is: Why is he eating the wet food and not dry? and do i have to keep giving him wet or will he go back to dry again?

It is kinda funny that he wants to show me he is the best, but sometimes I become unseated and this worries me, his habit that is. (Thank God for western saddles.)   3.What to wear during shows?

I know there isnt any in the tank because I've checked everywhere and the platy is still big. even though she is orange I cannot see a gravid spot. She only has a big round belly. My swordtail (also pregnant) has the spot and when I had a female guppy she did as well. My molly is black and orange (golddust) so I couldn't see it. But could the platy be pregnant or an I jus crazy?

20090128115544AA8G1L6	Pets;Dogs	My dog won't come back when I let him off his lead!?	O.k, so I have a black lab. He is 3, 4 in July. I've taken him for a walk to the local park times before, but when I let him off his lead, he will run off excitedly and will not come back however nicely I tell him to or however I tell him at all. I used to bring treats and try and bribe him with them and that worked for a bit, but other times, he just wasn't interested at all, especially when he saw another dog coming. So, as I said, I have used the treats and calling sweetly and I've even bought him a clicker but that hasn't worked either.      Now, I am too embarrassed and kinda nervous when I let him off. Don't get me wrong, he is  an amazing dog and wouldn't hurt a fly, he just won't come back. I am quite nearby to a few playing fields so it's not the distance that bothers me, it's just I think he should get more excersise  than walking round the neighbourhood with me.      Anyone got any ideas what to do. (I've tried the '' when the dog smells the cup, give him a treat'' stuff and all that.       Thank you!

20090128121324AAu8lWx	Pets;Dogs	Why does my pug scream when alone?	I have a 1 1/2 year old male, neutered pug, and I guess I should say that he is very spoiled. He comes to work with me everyday and stays home with friends when I am not at home. He goes for a mile walk everyday and the dog park every sunday.  He is rarely ever alone. The problem is whenever he actually is alone he screams uncontrollably and scratches on whatever he can get his paws on, such as doors, walls or the sides of his crate. He will not let this go either, if I am gone for three hours he will cry and scream and bark the entire time. When I am at work he screams and barks just when I go into the bathroom. Its gotten to the point where I have to bring him into the bathroom with me just so he doesn't freak out. If he is in the car and I just run up to the ATM machine or get gas he will scratch at my windows and scream the entire time. Does anybody have any idea how to fix this? Its starting to get really annoying to the fact where I have to revolve everything I do around him and he is just a dog, I feel like he owns me and all i want is for him to just to learn how to be alone.

Besides the constantly chewing everything, she is well-behaved and housetrained and can sit. Sometimes though, she will bark at me for no reason... I read that this could be a sign of dominance. Is this normal for a puppy to bark at their owner? She doesn't do it very often but I don't like when she does and I tell her "no" in a disapproving (but not loud) voice, but she'll bark a few more times after I do. Is it too early to try to teach her to speak on command? And will that stop her unwanted barking?

First I thought It was because it ate too much food, so i didn't feed it for two days. While the other guppies stomachs got slimmer, this guppies stomach is the same size!    http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn64/...    http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn64/...

20090128120145AApkfLr	Pets;Horses	Question about horse trailers?	I have a 1976 heavy duty King 4 horse/stock type bumper pull trailer with 8 12" panels and hayrack on top. It was at one point owned by the City of Calgary until they no longer dealt with livestock. It is a heavy duty trailer with a Pintal Hitch.      I know this is bad but i didn't register it right away after buying it as it needed a new floor put in before i could use it for the horses so it hasn't moved and is now being use for storage. Now i need to register it and have lost the old reg. slip.      Would "King" be the model or make? I can't find any info on these trailers and don't know if all stock type trailers have models AND Makes? Any help would be great. Who would i  contact to find out more? The previous owner doesn't know what it is because she gave me the reg. slip that i lost.      Thanks!

But is it possible to cycle a 2.5 g? I dont wanna use the gravel from my established tank because i dont like the color of it and it wont look pretty with a betta. But is it possible to just use some of that gravel until the bacteria spreads and then i can put the old gravel back in its 10g. The reason i am asking this is because i have multicolored gravel in the 10g but this time i want just one color gravel in the 2.5 g lol.

20090128133727AAlEwc1	Pets;Dogs	What would be the best dog?	Okay my cousin just got her own place. A small 1 bedroom apartment.      But she says she would feel better if she had a dog. She misses having a dog like at home and she said she would feel safer.      What is a good dog for her. This would be her first dog on her own.      they have a 50lb weight limit (and breed restrictions)      What would be a good dog that would be good tempered and a good companion but would also be big enough to intimidate people since she would be alone.      She is willing to put the dog in training classes and walk the dog 2 times a day.         Here are the restrictions:      We do not allow protective class dogs: Pit Bull, Doberman, Rottweiler, Chow, German Shepard, Husky.            And there was something about having to have approval of the breed she chooses....so I'm not sure.         I'm thinking of suggesting a Basenji, a Min Pin, or a Corgi      She doesn't want a cutesy fluffy dog but something sleek and slightly intimidating....      She is going to most likely adopt from a shelter (though most dogs she has seen while looking at the shelter have been Pit bull mixes and rottie mixes and she can't have those.      What do you think would be the best breed      (She is new to the city and all alone)
20090128135203AAQKWDq	Pets;Dogs	My boyfriend wants a Pit Bull.....?	Well, my boyfriend and I have been doing the long distance thing for almost a year since we graduated college. He will be starting law school in my town in the fall and plans on moving here in June. His dream since he was a little boy has always been to own a Pit Bull.       And no, it is not for machismo or for security or what not. He has always loved the breed, researched it for years, and has all these training plans for it including puppy training school, agility training, etc.He actually hates that people breed/train these dogs for the wrong reasons and we are both very aware of the stereotypes of the breed.      The problems are:   1. He will be in law school. Not much time for a pup, especially one requiring extra socialization.   2. I have a Miniature Dachshund and i have read that you should not leave a pit bull alone with a small dog (and no I do not believe everything I read) but I would never forgive myself if something happened to her!   3. This is a man I see myself marrying. We will likely someday be living together. My mom HATES pit bulls. she is not educated about them but is very stubborn in her disregard for the breed. My neighbors small dog was killed in its own fenced in backyard by a pit bull and she judges the entire breed now. How can I get her to accept my bf's new pit bull puppy as part of the family and a safe dog??      So basically, I am looking for some advice, suggestions, or even jusr reassurance that Pit Bulls are great dogs. I have always defended the breed but after my neighbors dog was attacked by a "nice, home-raised and well trained" Pit bull, I have doubts I just can't supress.      Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this or answer.

I was thinking tropical but then I thought goldfish because tropical are hard to look after and they die usually after the cycling process, goldfish are hardy.     But one day i would be thinking goldfish and the next i would pick tropical, what do i do?

20090128142420AALmPQ6	Pets;Horses	Experience with Pro Choice SMB Elite Boots?	I'm looking for some new boots for my horse. We mainly compete in barrels, and the boots I bought him were cheap boots from the local used tack shop. I feel that it's not giving him enough protection for those tight turns. He's a moderate competitor, but getting busier and busier. We compete in barrels, poles, keyhole, getting into cutting and reining. I'm really trying to put his health and saftey as a number one, and trying not to break the bank while I'm at it. (17, pay for all my horse needs myself, parents don't care that I ride, but don't endorse it. They say that me paying for my "hobby" will teach me responsibility.) SO.....my question is what is your opinion on the pro choice SMB elite boots?    http://www.discounthorse.com/product/boo...       also....do you know of any good boots that don't cost an arm and a leg? thank you!!

It reached 43 degrees celsuis in Melbourne, Australia yesterday and while I have the luxury of an air conditioned office, my kitty has to find her own shade outside because its to hotter inside our house!!!      I have put fresh water outside for ger with a frozen water bottle inside to keep it call, but it was nearly melted before I even left for work!  I recently had her shaved to try and cool her down, and last night I wet her with a towel and stuck her next to the fan... but the heat drys her out so fast!!! She slept all night on the bathroom tiles as well...      Our local vet offers boarding for cats and Im wondering if it would be kinder for me to leave her there over the weekend where at least there will be air conditioning for her...      Please help!!

20090128135922AAxtavg	Pets;Horses	Should i just buy a horse or keep looking for another horse to co-board? ?	i have been taking lessons for more than a year now and can walk/trot/canter on any horse, even the one with the bounciest trot ever.  i had to take almost 2 months off from riding due to exams/holidays/new school term, and when i took my first lesson after the 2 months, i picked up right where i had left; didn't even take me an extra 5 minutes to get used to riding again.   my instructor asked me during my last lesson what discipline i was interested in, and after thinking about it, i realize that i am not interested in anything specific. i just like riding, and it relaxes me after a week full of school related stress.  since i am a pretty good rider now, and have ridden a few co-boarded horses on my own, i was thinking that maybe i don't need regular lessons anymore. the problem though is that i am a student, and i can't really afford too many expenses right now. i tried co-boarding at 3 different locations and it never worked out; problem with owner, barn, other riders, riding times etc etc etc.  i want to continue riding once a week and don't know if i should just buy a horse or stick with lessons. or should i try looking for a better horse/owner for co-boarding?

20090128133956AAkjM7Y	Pets;Cats	To kill or not to kill a kitten?	My friend has a serious problem. She recently bought a pure-breed Himalayan long hair kitten.  It was very expensive, has all of its shots, and is a beautiful kitten (could be show quality).  She has a roommate in a small apartment who also adopted a kitten an (average alley cat). Her kitten is from a shelter and has been diagnosed with feline herpes and feline aids she refuses to put it down or get rid of it. Feline herpes supposedly can be carried through clothing, toys, on counter tops etc. Feline Aids can be transmitted through biting and drawing blood. The cats are always separated but at times use the same common areas when the other isn't around but people do make mistakes and could forget to lock one up someday.  The  apartment is so small it is cruel to keep the kitten in a small room all day and it needs to run around.  The vet told the owner of the infected kitten that it probably won't live very long.  The pure-breed expensive kitten is now in serious jeopardy of being infected and the other owner doesn't seem to care and won't reason with the other roommate. They are stuck in a lease and the economy is horrible, moving out isn't an option.  What should my friend do?

I bought a yorkie (from a reputable breeder)and she died at 18 months due to fits, I then went to a different breeder and bought another who at 3 years due to heart complications,  both dogs were from high show quality,    yet a relative has had her yorkie for 15 years and apart from being slow is in excellent health and he was bought and he was from a person who had 2 dogs which had a litter,       I know people are against breeding dogs because of over crowding but I have seen so many people say get a dog from a reputable breeder (or shelter).      I just wondered why so many people are against hobby breeders???      i dont mean to be rude but in my exp hobby breeders seam to have healthier animals,       PLEASE EXCULDE SHELTERS FOR THIS QUESTION.    I just wondering your opinion of breeding   i will post a link on here later on which will show you why i hate rep breeders. but just wondering your opinions first your opinions first

Tenho um cachorrinho aqui em casa adotado a pouco tempo, ele faz 4 meses no dia 28. é uma mistura de pastor belga(o preto ) com Husky. Acontece que amo gatos e n?o quero ficar sem gatos aqui em casa(no momento estou sem nenhum). Conversei com meu marido e ele disse pra eu adotar agora, enquanto o c?o é filhote. Acontece que pela sua ra?a ele já é bem grandinho e li sobre husky e pastor que n?o gostam de gatos. O que acham adoto agora e conseguirei que eles sejam amigos, o c?o n?o vai me trair um dia e matar meu gatinho, mesmo estando acostumado? Pego um filhote ou adulto? Estava pensando em adulto pois já saberei como será o comportamento do gato, pois tenho um filho pequeno, e um gato muito bebezinho já tentei uma vez e n?o deu certo, meu filho queria pegar td hora....e o adulto já se defende de uma eventual brincadeira agitada demais né. Macho ou fêmea? Alguns dizem que gata é mais caseira(o q me atrai), mas outros dizem que elas s?o mais ariscas qto a colo, e meu filho ama bicho, é lógico que vai querer dar colo pro gatinho. Qto ao cio da fêmea e o xixi de marca??o do gato n?o levo em considera??o pois já pegaria castrado, aqui no canil da cidade. Me ajudem a resolver. Obrigada

I do this to try to educate people on the conditions of breeding farms and the fact that most pet store puppies come from places like those. I also would love to see more of these angels adopted into loving homes. Even if you are not thinking of getting another dog look at the site anyways so maybe you can help stop the abuse by knowing more facts and telling other people. Thank you for anyone who goes to this site to educate themselves and hopefully others. Remember everyone can help by becoming active in the fight against this cruelty, Do not buy puppies from pet stores.

Can people give me links to websites that hold this info. I would like info on every brand of food especially Purina, Eukanuba(sp), Iams, Canididae(sp), Blue Buffalo, Call of the wild, (I believe that is what it is called), Innova, and beneful. If you could also give me your personal experience on your brand of dog food as well that would be helpful.

20090225075857AARuazF	Pets;Dogs	House Breaking a basset?	I have a 13 week old basset hound. I have been trying to house break him. When i first got the dog i got a training book but it doesnt tell me much as far as what age to try to house break him so i may be trying to early. I have been trying since he was about 6 weeks old. ( i watched him and helped with the litter of puppies when they were born and as soon as i saw him i fell in love.  His name is Rosco) anyways the book i read said to start him out paper training him and then once you had him paper trained to take the paper away and watch him ery closely when he shows signs of having to go pick him up and take him out side put the paper on the grass and he should learn to go outside. Oh and your supposed to scratch the door when you got out so he learns a way to show you he needs to go out. Well i got him paper trained but since ive started to take him out side he's completely forgot about the paper and goes all over the house. So i was then told by his vet to try crate training. Im supposed to start new with him every morning let him out of the crate take him out to go bring him back in feed him take him back out wait till he goes then bring him back in and take him out every hour and after feeding him. if he goes in the house i put his nose up to it tell him its a no! take him outside and when i bring him back in put him in the crate until i take him back out. But this isnt working either. i have never owned a dog and dont know that much so some help is appreciated. Anyone got any ideas as to what im doing wrong?
20090225074832AAKHhga	Pets;Dogs	Should I have my Miniature Dachshund neutered?	I have an 11 month old male mini daxie who is very hyperactive and a bit of a handful.      We've had several male dogs of varying breeds but never had any neutered so I don't know much about the effects on behaviour or personality of this procedure. I love my dog and don;t want to change or upset him, but several people have suggested neutering might calm him down. Equally people have said it is his age and he will grow out of it.      It is not humping things that's the problem, more that he is boisterous and very naughty when left to his own devices (jumping about, running away and adventuring, tearing up pillows and toys).       Incidentally, he is definitely not bored or lonely or lacking in exercise, just very exuberant.       Is neutering the answer?
