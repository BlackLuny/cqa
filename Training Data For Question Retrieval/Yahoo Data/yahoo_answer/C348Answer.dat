O0ZAi9RRaa	The song you are referring to is "All You Need Is Love." During the last chorus, they quietly chant, "she loves you, ya, ya, ya... she loves you, ya, ya, ya....."|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	"All you need is love"|`|ZF02ozgLaa	No its not called she loves you ya ya ya. its called she loves you. its on album 1. its a really good album. lol! if you have any other beatles questions you can ask me... i have like every cd there is lol!|`|XgVP6bjcaa	IT's Called "She Loves You Ya Ya"
5kcO165naa	I loved this movie, RDJ is the best.    There's this part when Alpa Chino, Fats, Kirk and Kevin are planning how they're going to save Tugg and Kirk says, "I don't read scripts, scripts read me!" and Kevin says, "You didn't read the script?!" and Kirk rambles something about 'speaking that script shhit' and then it's like Robert broke character, smiled, then came back.     It's SO funny!|`|79ZdM70Taa	Oh, I lol'd alright.  I lol'd till I puked. Then, I puked on the pizza delivery man. He wasn't impressed. I had to go to court cause he sued me for the dry cleaning bill.  I hired a lawyer to represent me but when on the court date he didn't show and he kept the retainer.  LOL!    My favourite actor was Tom Hanks, playing the non-african american. He made me LMAO.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	No, I thought it was a piece of crap. The fact they are actually nominating actors from this filth, just really shows how much acting standards of lowered these days.|`|A0SsXJ4zaa	robert downey jr, delivered the best comedy, i loved tom cruised out loud cursing        anyways yah i laughed all the way through, my favorite was the little kid stabbing ben stiller at the end|`|7rYwuN2uaa	yes, i did!  the funniest imo were robert downey jr. throughout the whole movie  (i'm the guy playing that guy playing that other guy).  and tom cruise  in a fat suit and bald head dropping f bombs every other word was hysterical.|`|CA80x4SDaa	yea i did    robert downey jr. acts the best definetley     the funniest scene has to be near the ending whwn they try to get ben stiller out of the camps|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Actually, I didn't find the movie all that funny.    I think the 2 parts where I did laugh is where the director takes them out into the jungle, tells them what's going on, and then is immediately blown up and Ben Stiller thinks its all faked.    The other funny scene is where Ben Stiller goes back to the village and then comes running out to the helicopter with the little kid on his back stabbing him over and over again.
Plz4T3fzaa	I have a LOT of favorites, but I think my most favorite movie is Eagle Eye.  I watch it when no one else is home I can watch the action scenes (especially the thrilling climax) as loud as possible.  I watch it alone.  It's my favorite movie because of the sharpness of the plotting, and because of the way all of the plots come together to one intense and suspenseful climax. It's a very unpredictable movie. Excellent.|`|kGzKbe1jaa	harry potter ------->I love to watch alone at night  and I just love it|`|OKmJWGGGaa	O Lord. I don't think I could choose a favorite movie.  American Beauty, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, Neo Ned, Little Miss Sunshine, Into the Wild, Towel head... are just a few of my favorites.

On the subject of favorites, I believe in any aspect of life there is one special instance or event that stands out from the rest.  It's nearly impossible for me to put together a top ten list, but Goodfellas is the one that got me thinking about movies in general, paying attention to cast and crew members, etc.  Favorites are easy for me to pick out.|`|g5YgcA5Oaa	i love rush hour 2 it's so funny i first saw it on tv now i own it on dvd
8jxoTBWIaa	I was going to suggest abcfamily.com but since you said that doesnt have the episodes the only thing i can think of is youtube. (You will have to watch it in parts because youtube only allows up to 10 minutes of video)    Sorry i couldnt be of more help =[|`|kAIXDVu1aa	youtube|`|j9ta5ulqaa	I was wondering that too.

Good luck!|`|16a147d8164f962d7603e2ee7e357ff4aa	Try www.tvshack.net, it is an Asian site, so there will be Asian subtitles, you it will still be in English, and evey episode is free, but after a certain amount of hours watched, you will have to wait several minutes before you start watching again, but still, you can watch as much as you want for free.   P.S. There is no grantee that they will have this particular show.

Slooooow down.  lol  The season hasn't even finished on air yet.  :-D    The first 4 episodes are going to be collected and released under the title "A Galaxy Divided."  It will hit shelves on March 24th.    The entire season will be released later in 2009.  I suspect in time for Christmas, but they haven't announced a street date yet.  We'll probably see advertisements for it this summer.

iz8hh0vNaa	If you like, if you know the actors you would like to choose, then go onto the fansites of them. for example your search on google would be  now, I said.. for example. "Adam Sandler fansites"  and it will give you links, then search throught he fansites, and you will usually come to very good photo galleries of the actor/actress.    I use this method of photo searching a lot.  Because I do media and we often need the very high quality photos for editing.    If you don'tknow the names of the actors,  I think the site is called allmoviephotos.com  I'm not 100% sure if that's the name, but if it's not, just search for it, and search for a movie where you know the actor/actress is from.  Hope I helped.|`|fneQSUzfaa	Go to:  www.google.com  or  www.yahoo.com  and just click images and type in their names! =]   Hope I helped!|`|49e200670f254de232e11a361988f371aa	anywhere. myspace, yahoo, google. magazine websites.            please check this out and add me on myspace and subscribe on my youtube i will be adding videos this week.....

5J0iCT5Xaa	You can watch it on abc families website at http://abcfamily.go.com/abcfamily/path/s... It was a good episode.  Ricky tells Grace that he can't see her until his dad is gone.  Amy tells Ben that he can't go with her to doctors, birthing class and to the birth of the baby.  George tries to find someone to help him get rid of Rickys dad.  Jack meets the person he is supposed to mentoring and he sees Rickys dad buying drugs. Amy finds out that the baby is a boy. Ricky tells people that he was abused sexually by his dad to Graces parents and adrean. Graces dad tells Ricky that his brother was sexually abused by the neighbor and killed himself because of it.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/...  watch the whole episode!! :D|`|DKiftd4Naa	Just watch the full episodes here:  http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/...

cevQ8wq1aa	Look in the novel "Stargate SG-1: Survival of the Fittest"  Teal'c states that he knew someone who attempted entering the Stargate via the back rather than the front on one occasion, and that his death was "most unpleasant", no further details given though.    "Brick Wall" or "Nothing" make more sense to me though.|`|g54tGcRvaa	I always figured it would exit you through the backside of the other stargate.|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	I assume it would be like hitting a brick wall. The flow of electrons might be polar and this would create a solid effect on the back side.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	I'm not a Stargate fan, but I would imagine the answer is "nothing". The back of a Stargate would be like the back of a rainbow, ie it wouldn't be there. The front of the Stargate (presumably) is a window through in folded space that is like the 2-dimensional equivalent of a Moebius strip, ie a 2-dimensional object with only 1 side, just as a Moebius strip is a 3-dimensional object with only 1 side. (I'm not sure what the scientific significance is of the huge KAWOOSH though.)
5iQ4FE1Uaa	It's called From the Valley to the Stars by El Perro del Mar  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5DUQjOzP...    It's a beautiful song. =)|`|DKiftd4Naa	Look up "L Word" in iTunes' iMixes.

8jxoTBWIaa	Basically Rickys dad gets put back in prison (Jack saw him buying drugs; he then called Adrienne; who called her dad and then got him locked up)    Amy found out she is having a boy and is most likely going with adoption. Her and Ben got into a little fight because he wanted to go to the ultra sound but she didnt want him there.     And finally her sister told some woman that she was over 21 and got a job as a cocktail waitress. sadly her dad saw her there and she got in trouble.     hope i could help! =]|`|0LxgeSJnaa	go to abcfamily.com    its on there HD too i think|`|cIROBuszaa	You find out the sex of Amy's baby.

fIK9LBEuaa	I agree with you completely.     I think the dancing rule is ridiculous! I'm not sure if you saw the episode, where one of the younger boys was dancing to some music in a toy store. One of the camera men (I think) said - I thought dancing wasn't allowed in your family? The older sister said quickly, "he wasn't dancing". Like he would go to hell if he was dancing to some music in a toy store! He was probably 4 years old, he doesn't know what sex or being erotic is!    I think they do need to loosen up. One thing I did find funny though - in one of the episodes, (since Josh and Anna aren't allowed to kiss before marriage) they were going to the movies and needed a chaperone to be there. The funny thing was - the movie was rated 'R', so they needed a chaperone over the age of 18. Can you imagine two people who won't kiss before marriage going to see a 'R' rated movie?!     I also think the Duggar's "courtship" idea is wrong. I don't know anyone who married the first person they started dating. I don't think that you should be expected to make a decision for the rest of your life, based on not even dating them! And also, when you date other people and get hurt, you know that its the right person when you don't get hurt. How can you know what's right and wrong, and learn from previous relationships, when you haven't had any? I wouldn't take pride in saying, "Your mom/dad is the only person I have ever dated or kissed" to my children. But that's just me.    I also think the part in the vows when they said that they would leave it up to God based on how many children they would have, wasn't right also. This young couple is just starting out, they don't have much money, barley enough to start a family. I can only imagine them having  5 kids in 6 years, and they are struggling to get by.     I commend them for having faith and doing well for themselves in a time like this, and I think they have enough love and money to support their family. So I have no issue with the number of children they have. But there are a lot of things I don't agree with, like how they shelter themselves. I can see one of them having TV shows, and the internet and going crazy. They need to loosen up just a little bit.    But, I do have a lot of respect for a woman that has given birth to 18 children!|`|69f74f3454bd6423f3d58ce955f6f59aaa	way too much for me - i wouldn't last 5 minutes with their rules    edit - yes shawn it is about personal choice BUT the parents are making these choices not each individual JMO|`|N4ezdVHMaa	While I don't agree with everything they do, there is much that I think they are doing correctly.  The parents know where the children are.  The children know where their parents are.  I have to remember that this is the only life they know, so ours is different.  It is not a situation where they are going to be put into the general population, really.  It is almost like the Amish lifestyle.  They are surrounding themselves with people that have the same beliefs.|`|7uB42JzJaa	Ok well here's what you can do to find out if raising kids in a different environment than the Duggars leads to whatever it is you think is right..let me know when you've had 14 more kids, raised them on your on terms, beliefs and values and compare them to the Duggars, chances are the Duggar kids will come out on top as model citizens, loving parents, and caring partners.|`|FlWubFnhaa	First of all must everybody be the same?  Must everyone have drugs and alcohol and dancing at his or her wedding?   This has nothing to do with religion but personal choice.    As for women staying at home and the way the Duggars believe, it has been around for years.  It is sad that a woman sees herself as a baby maker.  If I was the one he married, I would tell him to take a hike if he expects me to sit around waiting to have 20 children.        I too was raised in a strict church where women only sought to get married, even educated ones.  The Duggars are from Arkansas.  They are sort of mountain holiness pentecostal type folk.   As for praying, the bible does say that we should pray about everything.   Yes, some pray and ask God when or if they should use the restroom.    It is where Christianity or grace ends and religion or tradition begins.    If you did not noticed, he basically sought a girl that had been raised like his family.

There are a few scenes of brutal violence and one intense scene where the girls are kidnapped but other than that there isn't much that would really scare someone.|`|AA10795350	It's an action/suspense movie, not a horror movie.

That's why there's always lawsuits afterwards. Look at the movie The Buddy Holly Story. They are STILL in litigations over that movie, that was done over 30 years ago. And, I Walk The Line, the movie about Johnny Cash. His daughter by his 1st wife has sued her step-siblings because they portrayed both her parents wrong.    Ike was an idiot but I'm sure Tina wasn't an angel, either.

If they do, I really want to be a part of it. Like directing and producing and stuff. Maybe not onscreen.

Or if I'm talking to someone who just made NO sense at all I say "Who shot who in the what now?"|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Pardon|`|0FTwnzkOaa	It all depends who you are in the conversation with,  Pardon would do across the board, I would think.|`|AA11350988	I usually say 'Sorry?'  but when I talk to close friends it's more of "What?" or "Eh?"|`|VpuK1qTmaa	pardon? or....you what? or sometimes......huh? or just a confused face..|`|VwJQZfQJaa	sorry?|`|G5nSzRJqaa	Why did you say (insert word I thought they said)|`|Ac0jF74vaa	i usually say...

I knew them back in grade school but not anymore.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	I don't think that's too much to ask.|`|3EyK4x2Naa	I know most of them and their general location. If you give me any state I can tell you where it is, I just don't think I can name them all off the top of my head. P.S. I'm in college too.  I too had to draw a map and label the states and their capitols, but I agree with the girl above. If you don't use it you loose it. I knew that stuff in 4th grade, now in college I don't use it so no, I don't remember.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Only if they plan on going to them.  That's what maps are for.|`|7nGwou8uaa	i learned it way back when too...i wouldnt think it would be too much to teach it or too much to remember at least most of it. idk whats with your classmates...|`|eRg04AoEaa	Ha! Yes, we should all know! I took 3 Geography classes in college, I wanted to learn where states & countries were, I really WANT to know, but they didn't even teach about that, so I learned on my own with maps on-line! Some people don't know because they were never taught it! Don't be so down on those people, maybe they want to learn too! If they don't care, then by all means, they're idiots!|`|UXOwJlHdaa	uh no. Geography that specific is completely useless. Fact.|`|58KUMpF0aa	Even I don't remember all fifty.

I never learned any geography and never learned capitals.|`|441GSyaMaa	Well..yes, I'm from England (United Kingdom) and I know, not all, but a fair few states and where they are, and then obviously i know Europe and a lot of counties in the UK etc|`|fTZYnoMHaa	........|.....  ........|..BG's big trucker......|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  VROOM|`|4c5726b963122e60694b7e3e59161e71aa	We shoulc but we are not taught to remember them. People not from the USA knows everything about it. And we sit here and just live because its either live or die. I don't know all fifty states and i am to busy to go look them up and learn them. But i think i will it puts americans to shame.    Captials are a whole other issue if i been to South Carolina and the only place i been to was dillon then it must be the capital lol.|`|aqLDMy2Maa	Dam straight they should know.  They should not be allowed out of junior hugh if they can not go to a map and name all the states.|`|vT2DLgHPaa	Oh my goodness, I totally hear ya!  I had to memorize all the states and state capitals when I was in fifth grade.  It really wasn't that hard.   I am now a senior in high school, and I can locate every state on a map. (It's pretty pathetic that I have to say that...so many Americans nowadays are dumber than rocks.)  I'm not as good at state capitals anymore, but I can probably tell you at least half of them.  And no, it's not a lot to ask at ALL.|`|bYWTE40Vaa	I like peanut butter.  Im pretty sure thats the capital of Delicious, our 64th state|`|1ZfkQBg3aa	Yes they should you should know about where you live its kind of like living in a house and not knowing where the kitchen is.|`|c0p2BYwnaa	Honestly, i learned that a while ago and unless you're a traveler, it's not important to know all of that geographical information. As long as you know your state and it's capital, you're not too pathetic.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	i dont know the capitals and i barely know 13 states|`|35YwlNF9aa	i know the states but not where they are located only some|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	Yes they should.|`|boCczAN4aa	College??    I learned this in 4th grade...|`|mSL9pUOKaa	Well yeah...Honestly if you gave me a blank map I couldn't name all 50 especially in New England. But yeah people should know them.    I mean...I don't think it should be required but it would be nice to know off hand.|`|yRRnbNqXaa	DEFINITELY!!! Since many americans think The Nile is in "somewhere in Europe" (not!!), you should ALL at least know your own states|`|P4RZK3dyaa	No! Haven't you ever watched Friends? (Chandler's 50 states game)|`|B8IpOdwQaa	i know all the states and where they r located   i think that people should know this.|`|CNlfn5Wraa	You would think one should but look at the amount that can't speak English or spell.|`|ztzL7ntwaa	Yes definitely. That kind of goes hand in hand with being a citizen, wouldn't you think?  I too learned them in the 4th grade!     And no that is not too much to ask!|`|nslIX6CZaa	Hehe In Australia, we only have 6 states and its hard enough for people here to remember them. People also don't realise that New Zealand is a country of its own, they tend to think of it as Australia's seventh state. So you think its wrong that people don't know how to name and place 50 states over where you are, I think its shocking that we only have 6 states to name, and people have no idea. Its quite sad isn't it.|`|q8Tkh1zdaa	Wow.... I was watching The Soup the other day and they had this clip of this lady trying to located Miami.....|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Definitely.

I have known this since I was a kid in elementary school.|`|c9plVVYcaa	Of course, I wasn't even born in the states and I'm able to do it.    I can do, USA, Mex, Canada, Spain, since I've lived in these countries.|`|oLxKV2OCaa	Yes we should.    Argentina  Belize  Brazil  Canada  Chile  Columbia  Cuba  Ecuador  Guatemala  Guyanna  Honduras      wait... it the Carribean a part of "Central America"?|`|S42yzY99aa	I know all the states, I know where more than half of them are located...

LOL|`|PPFonRYdaa	I had to learn all the states and their capitals in 4th grade as well. I can still remember them all and it's been about 14 years now. I just don't get people sometimes.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Yes of course! On a recent news poll I saw on TV, Americans were asked to name a country starting with U.

[or else, itd be a little hypocritical, dontcha think?]    but then again ignorance is a choice. if you want to just sit there ignorant not knowing about your surroundings or the country in which you live so be it. it doesnt make you any less of a good person, it just makes you...ignorant. meh, I like to be informed. you never know when this kinda stuff pops up in conversations. more info=get along with more [kindsa] people champ.

Homeschool isn't working......|`|czHD5tPwaa	Gotta be honest, No. Do you actually think home-schooling is easier than a normal school?Because even if this was true, You wouldn't be getting a proper education with the slacking. And due to your spelling and grammar ability... I'd say go to a normal school.|`|gspTDufpaa	No|`|mggll8dRaa	You probably would also enjoy the Social part of Schooling, if You went to a Regular School....!!|`|mqdkcHDFaa	Have you considered that you'll miss out on all the good things about school-life?  The crushes, friendships, satisfaction of being ranked in the top 10%, sports, prom, graduation, etc...  And just letting you know, school is pretty much useless until you hit high school, and then your freshman year is pretty useless too.  Your sophomore year is the year things start getting tough.  Personally, I'd never want to be homeschooled- are you kidding me?  No friends or tennis?  Doesn't sound too good to me!|`|2f3f9068d7f4d4acd330c2510f225b40aa	No, homeschooling sucks.  Stay in school!|`|2193c4e44db8189b4abf5d6676cc8346aa	homeschooling, why?  You will miss out an allot of social development and interaction|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Just talk to them about it|`|INf502UUaa	Just go to school...it's not going to kill you.|`|58KUMpF0aa	Why not?|`|ERgL2Dhpaa	i don't understand why you would want to be home schooled.  i would feel isolated from civilization but if that's really what you want to do then do it.  why can't you just explain to your parents you want to be home schooled? do your parents have that much time on their hands?  anyways, if you decide to go through with your question you might want to delete this before you leave your site up...|`|SvzKyWGXaa	No.  Do your parents have the capability to homeschool you?  You still have to follow the government's curriculum, you know.  Not to mention you will have a minimum of social life.  Real school is much better, trust me.    And I can't predict what your parents would do, but every time I tried something like this they missed it completely.    I suggest you think it through.  Much more thoroughly.  And if you're actually sure, approach your parents in a more serious manner, if you want them to take you seriously.|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	well i don't understand your question but let me tell you this homeschooling  depends fully on the student and the program you do i am homeschooled was homeschooled in third grade and hated it but then in eighth grade i went back to homeschooling and ended up doing a different program and now like it my sister on the other hand is on a different program and is wanting to return to public school next year so just think it over make sure homeschooling is what you want to do and if it is then talk to your parents if you dont think that will work go with your gut    p.s also dont listen to the messages about students who are homeschooled are outcasts and dont have any fun you can find fun to have my parents set up field trips and i get to get togeather with friends to hang out.|`|cDeTatqCaa	no... stay in REAL school|`|22IKmgWZaa	i'll be frank, i have no idea wht ur talking about.    but go ahead, if it makes u happy, do all those accidents ur talking about.|`|3CQb6PSFaa	i'm sorry, it's probably because im blonde, but i don't understand ur question..|`|EsgKr5z8aa	seems like you have it all worked out.  Might as well give it a try.    then you could casually tell your parents that you met someone that was homeschooled and they said it was awesome.    btw. Im homeschooled.|`|sZUxyMqHaa	Yeah, if your dad will actually look at it...but I think discussing it with him is a lot beter scenario.|`|j9tvu3rFaa	well, interesting plan, but home-schooled people are typically weird. Not all of them, but you'll have, like, no friends and your social skills will die of starvaion and...who will homeschool you? Don't your parents have jobs? Are they willing to do that when public schools are free and don't take up their time?|`|49e200670f254de232e11a361988f371aa	lol. i think your idea is cool.            please check this out and add me on myspace and subscribe on my youtube i will be adding videos this week..... PLEASE HELP ME OUT:] ooo and comment            http://www.youtube.com/user/heleneimmel    http://www.myspace.com/heleneimmel|`|35YwlNF9aa	umm that was confusing to read|`|FFrUZAoraa	Why do you want to be homeschool'd? Because you have to go to bed early?   You will regret it later on when everyone has lots of friends and lots of socializing.   You dont get that with home school... it's also another place that you will never meet girls.  I'm telling you, whatever problems are discouraging you from school they are minor.  You would regret it later.  Friends are everything and you normally meet lifelong friends at highschool.

18K7ucsEaa	I think you should! If you have been in a band before, then you definitely know that you can make it. I guess it's just a mental thing. Loses like that are tough, but in all honesty (I'm not trying to be insensitive- I'm very sorry for your losses) it's going to continue to be a awkward situation. Once you try it again, it probably will be very hard at first, but you will be able to handle it.    "What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger!"    :-D

Western food is too flavourless according to me lol|`|3mJiPveSaa	Let me count the ways of the symphony of flavors, colors, textures, seeds that is Indian cuisine. I love how meals are constructed to balance these things - spicy curry to excite the tastebuds, cool raita (yoghurt-based) to cool the palate, fragrant basmati rice to absorb flavors and foods, flavorful dahl (lentils) completes the base with rice for nutritional balance. Who wouldn't enjoy luscious tropical fruit lasse (smoothie, love mango!) or exotic dessert like gulab jaman (fried cheese/dough balls is rosewater flavored syrup).

The rights will return to Howard at the end of his contract (Jan, 2010).    Howard has said he has no interest in putting together a CD History right now.  He didn't say he'll never do it though.  I honestly believe it will be released but later rather than sooner.

Then do 5 smokes a day for three to four days and so till you get to one a day.  Then you could try one smoke one day skip a day.  Do that for a few times.  Basically ween yourself off.

09HDdTfHaa	A.) TRUE i remember seeing brocks father when they visit the pewter city gym......and mays dad is norman the gym leader in petalburg city|`|3N2ElzcQaa	A.) True    They're just not seen|`|JKQGy2aZaa	well ash does because it talks about him in episode 2 and then it never shows  him WTF     and i think it shows both Mays and Brocks fathers     so A)true|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Well obviously they all have fathers.  Whether or not they are ever mentioned or are living is a completely different story.  That's assuming they were real life people too of course.  So I'll go with A) True.  Everyone has a father.  Whether it be by a random sperm donor, a deceased lover or a deadbeat dad.  EVERYONE has a father.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	I only seen Brock's father|`|6AxMy4WMaa	im sure Brock has a father and its a gym leader also may.. but ash .. idk if he has als o misty.. the story never tells about them ^^|`|9XH4f21Haa	B. False|`|B9JwxyRfaa	A. True    Even if they don't show up onscreen, being that they all exist in the world created by Pokemon, and being that another organism has to come from some other organism in some way, they all had to have some sort of father in order to exist.  Though their fathers are never shown in the Pokemon series, they all have to have fathers for the aforementioned reasons.

usltkMnwaa	oh course that ish is fake! He would get so sick for eating at least one thing he does in every episode. I think there are factual information on the show, but he is presented to them with bailouts and extras that we do not see. I think he is skilled and does a lot of crap that I would NEVER, even if it was face (like catching a 12 foot python and cutting it's head off).     It's still a great show. Surviver man is too boring and he is always complaining and setting trap of which he NEVER catches anything. So, Man v. Wild is still my fav surviver show.|`|v9BXkm57aa	yes i know he has a camera crew its so fake... i like survivorman better|`|j9tvu3rFaa	i know! I've never thought about him making it up, but probably. No one could pay me enough to seriously do that. Yuck.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	That's the whole point. You have to be sharp enough to be able to make-do with whatever you find. If you need to stay out of a sandstorm, or out of the cold night, and all you've got around you is a dead camel, or sand, you use the camel.|`|VCCzAyvsaa	I think it's real, call me what you want.|`|AA10741077	I watch both, but I like Survivorman by Les Stroud much better.  He films it all himself.    I think Bear goes out of his way sometimes to be gross lol|`|y8wOnto7aa	who cares he is so hot and that accent huba huba!      some stuff he does though is like wtf...............|`|Q4dbgYmmaa	Yeah that stuff is all fake and they probably rehearse that stuff just for the ratings and for suspense all the "stunts" have stuff for a "soft" landing so he doesn't get hurt and then they film it again with stuff falling or crap like that when he is actually in no trouble at all.|`|7JppyBATaa	yes, he is so fake, and he stays in hotels! and plus i don't think i need to learn how to survive sandstorms because im not going to the desert anytime soon! survivorman is so much better!|`|C5QV222iaa	yeah i think its fake, one time i think he ate like elephant poop or something gross like that  no wait he squeezed the elephant poop and drank the juice that came out . nastyy|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	my favorite one was when he picked up elephant crap and squeezed water out of it into his mouth to drink...|`|G5nSzRJqaa	He does have to poop. What do you think there is a port-a-potty out there?|`|SR5zlAl8aa	no u would see|`|AA11306089	If you read the thing at the beginning it says that he puts himself into certain situations to demonstrate different techniques.. basically if he sees a dead animal, whether he's cold or not, he's gonna go jump in it.. it's a load of crap.|`|aqLDMy2Maa	I watch it and I do not care if he makes things up or if it is fake.  It makes for good tv.  I am never going to put myself in any of those situations so all I care about if it is good tv.|`|eRg04AoEaa	I've seen it a few times, & I hate it. I think it's absolutely ridiculous to make such a big deal out of him. What does he think people care to see him put himself in all these situations & try to make it? If you're going to be dropped off in the middle of a desert with no means for survival, & video tape yourself trying to survive, then you shouldn't survive because you're a moron! Soooo stupid!  Well, I have to say though, the next time I'm all alone stranded in the middle of the Sahara with no food & water I will find a camel, slice it up & crawl in because, gosh, I saw it on "Man Vs. Wild" Wooo hoooooo! I wanna live, I WANNA LIVE!|`|8VFKvFqPaa	its so fake!!!!!!!!|`|i8rgT2hkaa	i dont even care if its fake  hes hot|`|FvBj6bWwaa	no, getting inside the camel could keep you from freezing to death.|`|dKyUhbYOaa	Let's just say that if it's like -30 Fahrenheit and I'm stuck in Alaska, you bet your *** I'm going to get in that carcass and tough out a night than to die.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	WELL, lets use common sense here.  He has a tv show to show EXAMPLES of what to do if you are in the wilderness.  Dont you think, that you would have to make alot of things up on the spot since its the WILDERNESS.|`|ahXIBlstaa	Yeah but you know if you were stuck in a desert you'd be like "sh*t I should've payed more attention to Bear!"|`|9wblT5sYaa	well he was prooven fake.  his producers give him food and when it gets real rough out there heactuallyy stays in motels.  as far as the stuff on the show goes there are many times where I say to myself, that's ridiculous."  how will sticking my body into a camel save my life again?

It seems a little bit more accessible than earlier work (well, as accessible as it gets for Dalek!)  I saw them live a couple of months ago and they were excellent. I hadn't listened to them much before that, but they were good enough to make me check out more of their work.

08y217Rdaa	Western astrology is good at explaining what you think and why you think so, it explains why you get angry when someone slams the doors somewhere near you, or why you just could not care less.  Vedic on the other hand is just brutally honest how good or bad you look, how many limbs you are going to lose and how rich you can get.  Both are surprisingly accurate, they just explain different sides of life and fate.|`|esLaHM0Oaa	I wouldn't know, I'm still waiting for my vedic astrology profile or chart that I requested before christmas. Still nothing. Weird. How long does it take to make a chart done with them? And here I was, so curious and all. :/    )-(

It would be a better world.|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	The song is beautiful and brings great joy to me when I hear it. For me, the most important aspect of this song is the fact that he, in a very positive way, suggested that religion may be one of those institutions that prevents us from achieving greater compassion for each and every one of us.    Sadly, the world has too many grossly over-paid Rush Limbaugh types, who feed on breaking us apart into various tribes by religion, ethnicity, lifestyle, gender, and so on.|`|0jlG2clBaa	in his frank and open way of talking,lennon tells us his views(and he hopes that others share the same)..i'll tell u the meaning in my own way?  lennon said that there r lots of things that can happen in our minds that cannot happen in reality...so "imagine"...  and he's giving us instances,like if there were no differences between religions...nothing to kill others for...if ppl gave up being selfish,and thought abt the present instead of the future...and wat happened in the past...  the borders of the countries r there in real life,..but in the dreams,they can be omitted..  nobody has any material possessions that they call "theirs"...everything belongs to everyone..no one is greedy or hungry for power,..and its like all earthlings r a family,brothers..  and its so pleasant to imagine that everyone is sharing the world,instead of fighting for the imaginary boundaries ..  and all these fantasies can never come true...so he's a dreamer,and he knows that there r many other ppl like him...who dream of peace,love and equality..  and he hopes that someday,everyone will hv the same dream,and so it wont be a dream anymore,it will become reality...  and then we wont be separated by our countries,or beliefs and we'll live togather as ONE

Vq1A6zryaa	I do think more people would respect Mobb deep more.     Pac was at the peak of popularity and the fans would agree on anything he did. He was ruthless and yet wrote songs with meanings like keep ya head up, Pac was basically loved by anyone.      When he dissed mobb deep, mostly everyone followed his path.|`|1sapXjMvaa	Yes and No.  They get a bad rap from jay too when he dissed prodigy.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	I've never heard that. the reason people don't like them is because they haven't been good since Hell on Earth.    The Infamous and hell on earth were good. After that they fell off.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	Naw they get a bad rep.. cuz they rap theat gangsta stuff.. but Prodigy has been slapped by numerous people.. and robbed a few times... They soft, son.  U talk that gangsta life.. u need to walk dat gangsta life!    Saigon  Keith Murray  Tru Life    Where was the tuff talk then...  Prodigy been smakced more than Yung Berg in '08|`|xUhAqctjaa	2pac is no where near Mobb Deep's level.  They are far better.|`|AA10687320	i am a big Tupac fan and i have been listening to him for a long time, but just a few months ago i decided to buy The Infamous and i really liked it. and i can see myself buying more from Mobb Deep (they're older stuff before G-Unit), but to me it doesn't matter if they were dissed by Tupac or not i still like them.|`|C2olZsNiaa	I love Pac and also played the **** out of The Infamous and Hell on Earth.  For some reason (an some may not agree) it just seems like they fell a bit off after those 2 joints).  Mobb Deep never really got the recognition they deserved even before the whole pac thing.  Shook Ones is definately a classic in my book.      I believe the beef started with the whole East Coast / West coast thing jumped off. Dogg Pound New York, New York.    You should check out Pac, he is truely one of the greats and Mobb Deep are not up to his level and sorry...but will never be.|`|bCz8j97zaa	My experience is that people from the East Coast (who are hip hop heads) will always respect Mobb Deep. The beef 2pac had with Mobb Deep is irrelevant to how classic their albums are. "Psycho" 2pac fans, as you put it, should respect an artist for their talent. I can't remember what had started all the beef in the beginning.|`|0b109dcecd29e9166915951f5e50b7a5aa	Nope mobb deep sucks. Prodigy is the worst rapper ever. All their albums suck. And like the other dude that posted... Prodigy got slapped several times. These clowns are horrible, they've had like two great songs. Now they're with G unit... whack. Legend of The Fall Offs. Scratch that, Legend and Mobb Deep shouldnt be in the same sentence.|`|HHpVBoTuaa	This sounds like a "Subliminal" diss to 2Pac. You don't sound like a fan at all. People don't like Mobb Deep bcuz they don't like them. When was they last time they put out a "decent" album?      R.I.P. Tupac|`|RMNV3JiAaa	Mobb Deep is better.

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	I think Jin is alive (and even if he isn't, that doesn't mean much on this show).  I think Widmore is the other person Sun blames.  After all, Widmore sent the freighter.  He provided the explosives.  He paid Keamy and ordered Keamy and his men to kill everyone on the island.  I think Sun knows all of this and wants revenge.  I think she also wants to get back to the island to be reunited with Jin.    As for the paternity test, Dharma is one possibility.  They may want to get their hands on a child who they know was born on the island.  It could also be Ben or one of his people.  They know Kate doesn't want to go back, so this is a way of forcing her to.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	I'm not sure about the whoile Eden thing but it interesting about the stones and the fact that they are both still on the island not even wanting to be rescued.  I don't think Claire is dead because Walt has appeared on the island and he isn't dead and she is contracted to appear in the last series.  Jin might not be dead because although we saw the ship blow up he could have jumped at the last moment or the island moving could have had an effect on him.   I don't think Sun did the dna test because it would be pretty pointless as she knows the truth and she wants kate to keep aaron. I think Ben ordered the test so he could use the results as a threat to make kate go back to the island.

The current down economic cycle has changed that. But if the plan is to live in the same area for any considerable length of time. you at least are building some equity when paying a a mortgage, whereas renting gives you nothing but a handful of receipts after paying all those years.    The house I live in would cost $1400 a month to rent. My mortgage payment (10 year fixed, will be paid in full in two years) is $900 and the taxes are $450 a month, so I'm paying about the same amount, except that I get to deduct the taxes and mortgage interest from my income.  It's been far better for me to own than rent.    Plus, it's mine.  No landlord telling me what I can or cannot do.|`|gWleYSuIaa	I prefer the situation I have - my housing comes as part of my job.|`|AA10622097	Why should I pay rent to someone else and make their mortgage payments for them, when I can make my own mortgage payments, and build equity, credit, and self-esteem.

I'm assuming your talking about the USA, right? Our government is of 7 TRILLION dollars in dept.    C: THEY ARE giving out Stimulus packages.    I think you seriously need a little lesson. If you think this is bad, maybe you should check out the 3rd World Countries in Africa. In case you haven't noticed, we've got it great in the USA! But, since I need to 'answer the question' a petition website is http://www.petitionspot.com/ . Dude, get over yourself and open your eyes.

bFT9EinFaa	There's so many songs she has recorded!   For Classical, try "Panis Angelicus", "Pie Jesu", and "Ave Maria" for starters. For English, I like "The Prayer" with Josh Groban and "Dream a Dream" with Billy Gilman.  Also, I would definitely recommend Haley Westenra, and Sarah Brightman. Both of them are comparable to Charlotte Church, but have other strong points. And out of them all, Haley Westenra is probably my favorite to listen to.   Hope this helps! :)|`|AA10099008	I didn't know Good Charlotte did church songs... ha ha!

shbunZqnaa	Because I don't support music that constantly degrades woman, and such. Also, it's really hard to justify rap/hip-hop as a respectable medium when you hear stuff such as "MOVE ***** GET OUT THE WAY" on the radio. Also these "rappers" are spewing **** out their mouth by calling themselves the best rapper alive or whatnot. No they're not, especially when Mr. Weezy doesn't make sense 90 percent of the time.     You should listen to "real" hip hop yourself, instead of this mainstream bullshit    Also Kanye has went downhill with his emotional state, and the only mainstream artist I support is Lupe Fiasco. His underground is amazing too. Also Nas and Common. And Chamillionare (Watch Hip Hop Police and Evening News).|`|qpxPW5paaa	I'm twice as arrogant as people who listen to commercial rap|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	Hip-Hop is Hip-Hop... there is no real or fake Hip-Hop...|`|IhAnj35Maa	"F*** 50 Cent,Soulja Boy and Lil Wayne"  no more of this blingy, hoe type ****"   lol|`|OpBFc27iaa	allright, first thing...theres no such thing as FAKE hiphop Or REAL hiphop...just fake and real artist...there are real mainstream artist.    also, when it comes to music its all opinions, no ones right or wrong..alot of people just try and give some hiphop knowledge, but i think alot of hiphop heads aren't very open to any Commercial artist, but thats just a generalization.    people just need to listen to the music, and not have to worry about whats fake or real..if they like it listen to it.

eFowEpbLaa	Singing as a hobby is quite different from singing as a career. And while you might have your mind and heart set to becoming a professional singer, chances are, you have absolutely no idea how or where to start. Rest assured, however, that this uncertainty is perfectly normal. Nearly all of today's famous singers were once in the same position as you are now.    There is no single correct way to become a professional singer. If you start asking different artists you'll probably get different answers. Many times, an aspiring singers starts as a member of a local band and then proceeds to a solo career. Other times, artists have started as back-up singer for famous artists and then went on to start their own career. Cher is an example of such an artist.    Of course, before attempting to follow any of these routes above, you need to make sure you have certain skills that are necessary to all singers. First of all, you need to be able to sing to a tune, project your voice effectively and generally understand the mechanics of good vocal delivery.    Another important quality you should have as a singer is to be able to define your own style. Don't be afraid to experiment with phrasing and vocal riffs. If you manage to create your own unique style of singing then you're much more likely to have a serious singing career.    As a final note, be prepared to make sacrifices and have a lot of patience until you first see your name on a CD cover. You might have to start off as an amateur singer, or spend long nights in the recording studio. But be sure that every single professional artist you ask will tell you that in the end, it was definitely worth it.Many people consider taking their singing hobby and turning it into a career. Most people just don't know how. The links below should help you on your journey.Good luck!

aihogb26aa	That doesn't always apply to who wins or gets far in the competition though... as evidence you have Ruben, Clay, Fantasia, Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Hicks, David Cook, even Jordin Sparks. All of them were criticized for their looks by the judges at one point and all made the cut and got very far after America started voting.  I agree with you that in the mainstream that is almost always how it works...but that's what I like about American Idol. America often votes on who really reaches and entertains them, rather than purely on looks.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Oh, definitely. Ruben and Clay only did as well as they did because they were so damn hot.|`|gEkLQWF4aa	I don't completely agree. I think Rihanna is gorgeous and she really can sing. Britney can't sing and she's trash. Leona Lewis, or however her name is spelled, won the british version of american idol and she can sing her @ss off! She's not pretty, in my opinion. Huge nose. But sometimes people do get through because they have a mediocre voice and are really pretty. It's all about being marketable. If you're fat and ugly, most people won't want to watch you sing or perform. It's horrible, but that's how it is. We, as a human race, are attracted to beautiful things. It's human nature. But Kelly Clarkson won and she isn't that pretty. Carrie Underwood wasn't that pretty either, and like the other person said, you've also got Reuben, Clay, Jennifer Hudson, etc. So, that's not really true. Plus, that girl that sung last night, the "loving you" song, she was really pretty but she SUCKED and she did NOT make it through.|`|sCIPNupUaa	-_-"|`|VH98AKVgaa	Yeah because thats what people will buy.... it sucks but thats the way we run (~~~cuz everyones stupid~~~)|`|7lZnHiYZaa	Its not like that on this season anymore... Like there was that one Indian guy on like last week and by looking at him, you'd think he wouldn't make it, but he really did. And there was this one girl who was really pretty. but she was a terrible singer. So no, not always. BTW,  Britney and Rihanna CAN sing, and they are pretty to.

vqg6wpCLaa	Oh, here we go again. Wrong section, my fellow Yahoo!Answerer. Any Twilight related question does not belong in Comics and Animation - it's offending (I'm getting tired of telling you fangirls this). Don't go in movies or books though - that is also offending. Try Jokes and Riddles for it is the proper section for Twilight.    To answer your question:  Well, I wasn't aware that Edward was an actor! I thought he was just the one of the main sparkling vampires. Maybe I was wrong.   Try IMDB, and there your answer will be.  Also, the producers wouldn't replace Robert - he'd quit before that. Did you know that he hates children and fangirls? Don't believe me? Check it out yourself.|`|AdTnizwOaa	You might be getting confused with Jacob Black, they were considering replacing Taylor Lautner with somebody else :[ They will defiantly NOT replace Robert Pattinson though with all those screaming fan girls [including me] they wouldn't think of replacing him.     Vanessa Hudgens is auditioning for the role of Leah Clearwater in New Moon I'm not sure if it's right for her since I'm used to the preppy, shy, Gabriella in High School Musical 1-3. Leah Clearwater is tough, confidant, defiant, fierce and brave. But we'll see. They are also considering of adding Dakota Fanning in the Voulturi ;)|`|sYmx97Fhaa	trust me they are not taking edward out of the movie....and vanessa is not playing in new moon they said that they were not going to put vanessa in new moon...robert pattinson is still going to play edward they cant replace edward after they have already made the first movie and they are not going to i promise robert pattinson is still going to play edward i am 100% positive and vanessa hudgens i NOT going to play in new moon i read that on Stephannie Meyers website

CcYpcSb1aa	its probably something the wwe sound people made.  They have their own music production people.
bsnnEsp5aa	Claymore (action, mystery, demons, superpowers, medieval)  In times of olde, humans live in constant fear of demons known as yoma. These vicious creatures can take the appearance and memories of humans they have devoured, thus blending into society as they freely feast on human flesh. The key to stopping the yoma lies with the tolerated yet feared Claymores - women who are half-demon, half-human, and fully fated to become the demons that they hunt. Meanwhile, in a village, the young Raki has been banished; his only crime was losing his family to the yoma. Raki is drawn to a Claymore named Clare, and together their journey begins. While Clare fights the yoma plaguing the land, can Raki help her in her struggle to retain her humanity?    Blood+ [highly recommended](action, violence, supernatural, monsters, vampires)  In world where flesh-eating monsters roam the streets, only one organization has the means to save civilization from annihilation: Red Shield, a specially-organized unit designed to fight these monsters, and the only weapon that can destroy them: Saya. Awakened from a 30-year sleep, Saya is thrust into a modern world which she has no memories of, and is troubled by a past filled only with bloodshed and sadness. With the undying love and support of her family and friends, she struggles to gain the strength to move forward and regain the pieces of her shattered memories.    Devil May Cry (action, demons, violence, thriller)  Dante works as a demon hunter for the office of Devil May Cry, and as he is always in debt he doesn't have the luxury to turn down jobs as long as they pay well. His latest assignment is to be a bodyguard for the young Patty Lowe while she receives her inheritance. During the mission he was able to defeat the demons that got in his way and deliver Patty safely, but upon completion of the mission Dante discovers that Patty will be staying with him  indefinitely! Now, Dante must not only hunt demons and coexist peacefully with other hunters, but also handle the responsibility of taking care of a little girl!    Shounen Onmyouji (romance, demons, supernatural, historical)  Being the insignificant heir to a talented family is rough, especially for someone who has little of his own talents and honestly desires to live up to the family name. Masahiro is the young grandson of the famed Abe no Seime. Although most consider him to be little in the face of his older male relatives, Masahiro is certain he can not only continue the family legacy but that he can stand in his own right as an Onmyouji. With the assistance of his friend Mokkun, he works to increase his skills and abilities as a spiritual protector and guide. With a great deal of will and the quiet assistance of his insightful grandfather, he will become a force of good in the battle against encroaching evil.    Tactics (demons, supernatural, bishounen, comedy)  Since he was a child, Kantaro Ichinomiya has had the ability to see demons; but one day, the young Kantaro was told of a goblin so powerful that it could vanquish any foe with ease. Intrigued, his search began. Now, in the present, Kantaro works as an exorcist, banishing demons who have possessed human bodies; yet still he searches  that is, until one day, he touches a mysterious seal and releases the legend itself! His name is Haruka, he's good with the ladies, and he can kick demon butt like no other; but can he help Kantaro raise enough money for his rent?     Also try  Blassreiter (demons, supernatural, sci-fi)        Based on the other things you've seen, I think you would also like   Shakugan No Shana (fantasy, action, supernatural)  Sakai Yuuiji thought he was a normal high school student, until one fateful day when time stopped. Watching in horror, he witnesses a monster devouring the "frozen" people around him; but luckily for Yuuiji, he is saved by a sword-wielding red-headed girl that calls herself a "Flame Haze". The girl informs him that he has been dead for some time now and that his current self is merely a replacement for the human that he used be while alive. He is, she says, merely a torch whose life will come to an end when the blue flame in his chest ceases to burn. After this rude awakening, Yuuiji realizes that he is able to see the flames of life in other "torches"; and after discovering that a friend of his is also a torch -- and her life is burning out faster than his  he gains the courage to live out the rest of his life with meaning. Will Yuuji be able to find his place in the world before he ceases to exist?    Zombie-Loan [highly recommended] (zombies, action, comedy, supernatural, action)  Michiru has an unusual ability: she can see a dark ring around a person's neck that signifies their time to die. However, she suppressed her powers once she "saw" the deaths of her parents  until now. After accidentally seeing rings around the necks of two boys in her school, it seems that Michiru's powers are back for good. The two are zombies who are working for the secret loan office known as Zombie-Loan, and they need Michiru's help to find other zombies  those with dark black rings around their necks. Though Michiru initially refuses, due to a series of events it seems she has no choice but to comply...

I mean, you know whats goin on but you are not omniscient, you dont know everything, in that way you got to make it all connected.  Real fun. I really like that.

What Pandora Radio does is when you type in the artist or band to make your station, it has a program that will find bands or artists with similar genre's. This is what the website is all about. You finding different bands that are similar to your favorite. Its a very cool site if i do say so myself. I've been using it for awhile now.
gH0knRlUaa	Yeah, I always wonder about the the creation of time.    I mean, when time measuring was created, they could have come up with any value. Why didn't they use easier values like 100 or 10?    Of course, there are 24 hours in a day because of the behaviour of the moon but who decided that there would be 24 of these so-called hours?

My tickets were for 6.15pm too. I started queuing at 2.45pm and still wasn't near the front!    Although we did get VERY good seats, right above the judges heads on the second level up. The whole thing was brilliant and utterly entertaining!! They let you take pics up until filming starts, so take your camera/mobile.    Be prepared for the queuing (we weren't). It was FREEZING so dress appropriately (although the theatre was complete opposite, really, really hot!). Take plenty of food and drink, and make sure you go to the loo before you start queuing!    Have fun, it really was a cracking night! We got out at 11.15pm, saw 16 acts, four of which were put through.

And my star sign is Virgo and my husbands star sign is Virgo as well.|`|Bk1t83pFaa	Typically the "dominant" signs are the Cardinal Signs (Aries, Libra, Cancer, Capricorn).  Cardinal signs are meant to lead, to innovate, to initiate.  They are generally independent and authoritative.  Fixed Signs (Leo, Aquarius, Scorpio, Taurus) are not any less strong, though.  In fact, fixed signs are known for their determination and their stubbornness.  Mutable Signs (Sagittarius, Gemini, Pisces, Virgo) may be changeable, but they can also be strong in that they are adaptive.    Ultimately, you can't evaluate a person's "dominance" just by looking at their Sun sign (or as you call it, star sign).  You have to look at the rest of the signs in their natal chart.  Go here, find out what all of your signs are, read the descriptions, and see if you agree w what they claim:    http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...    Just to help you understand the signs a bit better:    Sun - the one you already know  Moon - depicts your emotional behavior  Mercury - depicts your intellectual behavior  Venus - depicts your romantic behavior  Mars - depicts your sexual behavior and how you take action  Rising/Ascendant - depicts how you first appear to people when they meet you    Usually you can evaluate which individual in a relationship will be the more dominant one by comparing the natal signs in each person's chart.  Consider the following couple's chart:    Woman:  Libra Sun  Capricorn Rising  Aquarius Moon  Scorpio Mercury  Scorpio Venus  Aquarius Mars    Man:  Gemini Sun  Virgo Rising  Cancer Moon  Cancer Mercury  Taurus Venus  Cancer Mars    In this relationship, the woman (whose Sun and Rising signs are both Cardinal) will seemingly be the leader from the start, the initiator, the one that calls the shots.  The man (Sun and Rising are both Mutable) will generally be happy to follow her lead.  However, since his Moon is in Cardinal sign Cancer, and hers is in Fixed Aquarius, he will generally make the first move when it comes to displaying emotions, or acting out of feeling.  Furthermore, since his Mercury is in Cardinal Cancer, and hers is in Fixed Scorpio, he may also be the one that initiates the communication in the relationship, where Scorpio will be the one to see the communication through.  Their Venus signs are both Fixed (Taurus and Scorpio).  Furthermore, the Taurus and Scorpio are in opposition to each other, which means that there will be much sexual attraction between them, as well as some misunderstanding.  Since they are both fixed, no sign will be more dominant than the other, and they will both butt heads and respect each other because of it - they are equals.  Taurus = force, Scorpio = passion.  And Force and Passion together are intense and unforgettable.     You can find out how your Venus sign and your partner's Venus sign match up by going here:    http://cafeastrology.com/articles/venusv...    The two people I provided up above are actually me and my partner.  It may seem that my Sun and Rising signs make me the dominant one, but it is not true.  He leads when it comes to emotions and communication.  For the most part we are balanced and equal throughout our charts...no one leads the other completely.      We also match up well here:    http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/si...    (Color coded compatibility grid...ooo!!)      Anyway, that was a long answer!  Haha but yeah I don't think there is such a thing as a most dominant sign.  All natal charts have their dominant parts.|`|AWC9OcQ4aa	Deffinatly leo because they have to feel the attention and feel like there noticed and there doing a good job which i can understand.

It's very cold to leave in the middle of a shower just to relieve yourself, plus you end up getting the floors and toilet seats all wet...|`|7ROXROUxaa	no. well maybe to poop. but peeing is ok. you're already in the shower so it's not like you're getting dirty from it haha.|`|bd0e62f6649334b0dc67af506ebd7128aa	No for no. 1, yes for no. 2.|`|xoZeL7PSaa	Yes, if I am in the shower cleaning myself, why would I p*** all over the place where I clean myself?|`|afee0e29771cb18093e76307e67462e8aa	Not if I have to pee.  I wouldnt suggest dropping a deuce in the shower though.|`|vgSVPz05aa	Yep.    If you pee in the shower, you never know what could happen, it could clog up and then there would just be pee in the bath tub, nasty!|`|JPDxyTT3aa	your supposed to do that before you get in silly pants.|`|WdmaRLwDaa	Yeah I do but it is annoying to get out and sit on the toilet with your butt wet and then when you have to wipe, the toilet paper is gonna get stuck on your hand or in your butt and then it gets to be really messy.

LuK19ZFPaa	No, thats something you have to develop in my opinion. Thats just me though.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	I think you develop it. I am decent at writing lyrics but I think it's because I read and write quite often.|`|NC67WVlEaa	I think it's an evironmental thing. You may be a better writer if you're exposed to alot of messed up stuff. Or if you're naturally more creative, writing may come easier to you. I think it's a skill that can be learned but, a more creative person would probably be able to write without as much practice.|`|Ot06v8yvaa	nobody is born with a talent. You have to keep practicing.

wOc4Dqllaa	I love them very much, they're definitely one of my favorite bands. My favorite song is probably Under The Bridge, others are On Mercury, By The Way, Cabron, Throw Away Your Television, Charlie, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Especially In Michigan, Strip My Mind, Soul To Squeeze, Aeroplane, Dani California, etc. Their cover of Search & Destroy is great too. Amazing band!    Flea's also a huge inspiration to me as a bassist, his basslines are my favorite to learn, and I've been told before my style sounds like his... Dani California was the first bassline I learned that doesn't consist of the same note for measures on end...    BQ: I've only heard his album Born To Run, which I love. I've heard some Springsteen which I really dislike, too though.  BQ2: Ugh. I've been doing chemistry homework literally all day. I got my learners permit yesterday, though, so I've been learning to drive, which is fun...  BQ3: I can't listen to it at the moment, but I love 80s new-wave in general.  BQ4: I actually found that yesterday... It's great, but I ;ike the original better.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	It used to be 'Under the Bridge', but I think 'Taste the Pain' is climbing its way to my RHCP fav now.    Lily, RHCP is a great band.  Just too "funk" for me to really love them is all.  Don't know why they aren't talked about a lot on here to be honest.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Hi Lily,    My favorite RHCP song is "Give it Away" I just love that song.    BA: I live in New Jersey, and Springsteen is kind of revered here. I actually like a lot of his older songs, like "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and "Prove it All Night" and the epic "Jungleland"    BA2: Boring. School was cancelled here in the Northeast where I live, and my son comes home to me at eight o'clock tonight! When I see my boy again I will be happy.    BA3: I love it! So campy, and campy can be tons of fun (in small doses)    BA4: I thought it was ok, I like the studio version better, I think|`|3dpIt3PIaa	I like RHCP, but I've heard most of the popular songs. Under The Bridge has gotta be my favorite. Not deeply into them    BQ: I've heard a few songs. He's alright  2: Okay, I forget what day it is though!  3: HAHA! LOVE IT!   4: OOH! Acoustic?! :D|`|pVTevFJgaa	Ok... now I have a feeling that I will get a lot of TDs but I don't really listen to any of these bands... And I haven't really liked what I have heard from RHCP, but I won't go as far as saying I don't like them, because, as you said, it's unfair to judge a band because of two or three songs... I am just not really interested in them...|`|75a43cbd95ebd2ae8dc628dd02d9b228aa	My favorite song by them is probably Under the Bridge. Favorite album; Bloodsugarsexmagik. I need to listen to them more honestly.    I actually prefer John Frusciante's solo work over RCHP, but thats my personal opinion.    BQ1: Never really listened to him :/..  BQ2: It's going awesome! I got out of school at 11:30 because of finals :D and I didn't have to wake up until 8:15!  BQ3: again, dunno.  BQ4: It's good. Still prefer the regular version though.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	I don't know many songs past the singles, but I love My Friends.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	No one speaks bout Underoath :( I know how you feel.      I am not a massive fan of RHCP but I don't hate them :/    BQ: Not a fan...just not my stlye  BQ2: Just Begun  BQ3: hahahah LOVE IT!  BQ4: hmmmmmmmmmmmm intrestin version!|`|9RTuRPviaa	I've always just been kind of indifferent on RHCP. I don't dislike them at all and they are a good band, i just never really got into them. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is my favorite    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV3jlzKoi...    bq: I actually like Springsteen alot. My mum listened to him when i was a kid, so i was always aware of him and liked him but i listened to The River album a couple years ago and just fell in love with it. However Jungleland is probably my favorite song of his.  bq2:my day is not bad, i had to drag out to work during freezing rain and snow this morning but i'm home now :) Hope your day was good!  bq3:You Spin Me is a song that i only hear once or twice a year. If i heard it more than that i would probably Really hate it lol.  bq4: Thats a really good version of Under The Bridge. It sounds so good stripped down like that. Thank you for posting it|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I really like RHCP...I don't really listen to them much anymore though for some reason.  Favorite song...hmm..."I could have lied"    BQ: He's ok I guess...I'm not extremely familiar with his work  BQ2: pretty good  BQ3: I like that song too =D   BQ4: awesomeness!|`|YbmklSzGaa	I love RHCP. I was trying to get my parents to let me buy a $200 portrait of Anthony painted by one of his former girlfriends. (It was on RHCP's site for charity). They wouldn't let me :(      They're one of my favorites! They're fantastic! They have so many different sounds and they're great with everything they try! I've read Scar Tissue so many times I can't even count. I'm currently making a collage kind of thing on my wall dedicated to them. My calendar last year was an RHCP calendar. John Frusciante's work is what made me want to learn the guitar.    As for my favorite song, there are toooooo many to choose!  I'll put one from each album :)    The Red Hot Chili Peppers-True Men Don't Kill Coyotes  Freaky Styley-American Ghost Dance  The Uplift Mofo Party Plan-Fight Like a Brave  Mother's Milk-Higher Ground  Blood Sugar Sex Magik-The Righteous & the Wicked  One Hot Minute-Aeroplane (I don't like Dave Navarro much)  Californication-Californication, Otherside, or Get On Top  By The Way-This Is The Place  Stadium Arcadium (Jupiter)-Charlie  Stadium Arcadium (Mars)-Desecration Smile|`|LuK19ZFPaa	didnt read that HUGE descroption     but "Suck My Kiss" is my favorite RHCP song, or possibly "Can't Stop"  but i love em all|`|CPxLHfKoaa	Can't stop is easily the best song ever by the peppers|`|rR6lwxjjaa	i think my favorite song is (and yes i know its a cop out) californication, im not a huge RHCP fan and thats one of the few songs that i really like  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Zm21M99...    BQ2: pretty swell except for the white death :)  BQ3: i love that song!  BQ4- i like that song a lot too|`|JyxNA1o0aa	I actually really like RHCP, i just don't have a full blown obsession, but theyare trully amazing! =D    I'm gonna skip all those llloooong BQ's and answer the favorite song:  Don't Stop|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Not really a RHCP guy. Mother's Milk and BSSM are very good records, but all in all their early stuff doesn't move me and I don't think their stuff after those records minus a song or two really... I don't know. I think they just lost it somewhere along the line.    Favorite tune: at this moment, Naked In The Rain    BQ: First couple records were really good. From there he's kind of hit and miss for me. It feels like the miss ratio gets greater as time goes on. Asbury Park is amazing though. Darkness at the Edge of Town too.  BQ2: It's good, thank you. Hopefully going to do some work in the studio if everything lines up right. Try to get our record done in the next couple months here (fingers crossed).  BQ3: Brings me back. I like that one.  BQ4: I'll have a look...|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Under the Bridge     BA1:  He's Alright.. my mom listens to him a lot, so I tolerate him  BA2:  Pretty good, although its cold and rainy  BA3:  LOVE IT!  makes me think of The Wedding SInger  BA4:  I Like it.  I love it when bands do the acoustic thing|`|7B2s7maWaa	Don't kill me Lily, but "Can't Stop" is my favorite RHCP song.     bq:   I like him, not a big, big fan. I like some of his songs and I can respect what he has done for music.  bq2: Good. Yours?  bq3: Ehh not for me.  bq4: Abolutely love that song.|`|wXv50mNEaa	To be honest, the only RHCP album that I've ever listened to in full is Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and I really didn't like it. "Under the Bridge" is a great song, but other than that it seemed very repetitive and indulgent. Flea's a great bassist, but every bass line of his seems to follow the same format. Not to mention some of those lyrics; "Sir Psycho Sexy" was a little off-putting. I'd have liked the album if it was about a third as long; its faults would seem charming instead of unbearably irritating.    But to each his own. I know a lot of people like them, so I'm not gonna assume that I'm the only one who knows what I'm talking about.    BQ: Pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan.  BQ2: It's been worse.  BQ3: I love camp, in small doses.  BQ4: I like it. It's a little more heartfelt.    Yeah, I know I'm really in the minority here.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	I like them, they're one of my favorite modern bands! :)  Anyway, I have several favorites, can I share only one? I'll try to narrow it down:    "Otherside"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73_SY6dAe...    "Snow (Hey Oh)"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3wolJG03...    "Can't Stop"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF96fB2WW...    "Charlie"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOIe_T2t7...    Just a few. I happen to really like RHCP, they're just really fun to relax to, and I don't say that about a lot of modern rock bands.     BQ: I saw a "Am I the only person who thinks Bruce Springsteen sucks?" question a couple of days ago, and I must say that I kind of avoided the question. I'll try not to do that here. I like Bruce Springsteen, but at the same time I'm a little indifferent. He's just one of those musicians that I can listen to, but hardly do. But I definately don't hate him.  BQ2: It's been okay. I have a bunch of essays that need writing before tonight, but that's school, right?   BQ3: Lol! I happen to love that song! I don't know why, it's so horrible and 80s but I can't help it, it's catchy as hell. There are very few 80s tunes I can tolerate, this being one of them. I have some bad taste just like everybody else.  BQ4: It's okay.     Peace!|`|HDaBjQA5aa	Me, I believe that they are one of the few good bands that are out recording today.  A lot of bands these days are often talent-less and the recordings are basically a computer singing it.  RHCP are one of the exceptions in this case and are deff one of my favorite bands.      My favorite song is desecration smile (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJTCU4Lgc... which was released off of 2006, stadium arcadium.  I like it because its dark and very catchy in the beginning.  I have A LOT of other favorites by them. MY favorite album is californication, and bssm.    BQ:  Well I'm not a huge fan, but I often listen to his music when I'm in the car with my mom sometimes.  He's pretty good and I like how he is considered "The Boss". I like his album Magic, that was good.  I haven't listened to the new album, I want to hear it though, what's your opinion of it?  Have you listened to his live album?  one of my favs.  BQ2:  Alright, trying to write some songs on the computer (Tuxguitar) and I've also been receiving a ****ton of pop-ups :(, I am really tired I dunno why lol.  How is yours?  BQ3:  Okay, this is very strange, but catchy too!  My friend played me a song called "green light" or something.  I thought it wasn't good, but it got stuck in my head like CRAZY!  BQ4:  This sounds exactly like how I like to play that song!!  I like this version, many thanks for showing, going under my favorites.  If the chili peppers were to release a "unreleased, bootleg album" or something like that (like the Beatles Anthology) then this would be a FANTASTIC song to go on it! Under the Bridge is one of my favorite chili peppers songs!  I am currently covering it right now with one of my bands, if I get on youtube, maybe I'll send you the link to see what you think!|`|KEk728Gsaa	My favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers songs are Fortune Faded, Californication, Dani California and My Friends.    They're a great band. I definitely agree with you that they're better than most every modern rock chart topping rock bands right now.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4db3jpN_...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzeCEC7DJ...    Here is a couple I like see above    I have a lot by bruce, but not the new one.    Out side of my computer running slow not bad    sorry my links are running way to slow at this time, so I can't get to listen to them at this time sorry    take care  dave  sorry I could not be helpful|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	I actually love RHCP but for my fave I cant decide between Under the bridge and Suck my kiss.  BQ:Ive never really listened to him  BQ2:Great  BQ3:I love that song its in the Wedding Singer/  BQ4:Its good.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Hey Lily! =]    I quite like the Chili Peppers actually, i do indeed quite like 'em.   My favourite song of there's is "The Zephyr Song" Love it!    BQ: I don't particulary like him, just not really my kinda thing!  BQ2: Pretty good thanks, yours?  BQ3: Haha, i have always quite liked that song too! =D  BQ4: Tis pretty nice =]|`|dZyoGbUdaa	knock me down  i saw RHCP in 1991 and they were (probably still are) a great live band.  very tight and energetic.  bq: i like his early stuff up to born in the usa.  rosalita, i'm goin' down, i'm on fire and spirit in the night are favorite songs.  i think he got kind of bland after born in the usa  bq2: day went well. i'm pretty beat right now.  bq3: love that song.  its very catchy.  pete burns looks terrifying today   bq4: i like it|`|vyHe3Lfdaa	I Could Have Lied  BQ:I like some songs, I can't really get into him though  BQ2: I don't know it just started  BQ3: It's among my favorite 80's pop songs  BQ4: Meh    And yes, they are better than most chart topping bands out there today. = )|`|7dbWSo9xaa	RHCP - I could Have Lied|`|oUZLZusjaa	My favorite RHCP song is Higher Ground. It's really the only one of theirs I like. Flea is a good bassist, but he's given too much credit. Anthony Kiedis is just a terrible singer in my opinion. I'm not even sure who their guitarist is right now, but if it's not Dave Navarro, chances are I'm not a fan of him.   BQ: I like Springsteen, I'm not a huge fan but I do plan on buying his new album once I get a chance. His last album wasn't the best in my opinion, though there were a few good songs on there.  BQ2: It was going pretty well but it got worse just a few minutes ago...  BQ3: The video is hilarious, as for the music...eh...|`|K4Nt8kZPaa	I listen to Californication every day lol =]    BQ: Bruce Springsteen is one of my favorite songwriters...haven't heard his new album  BQ2: Okay.  BQ3: Haha, it's okay  BQ4: It's awesome|`|x0TnuI6daa	I love Under The Bridge, Soul to Squeeze, Breaking the Girl and Otherside.    1. I love Bruce Springsteen, particularly his older stuff (Born to Run, etc.) It'd be an interesting listen, this new album of his  2. My day is going well so far, its 10.45am here and the first of my days off, listening to some great tunes andtalking aout my favourite subject in the world, what could be better? lol :)  3. I don't mind the 80s version of You Spin Me Round, I quite like it actually as I am quite into the 80s genre of music (be that to my detriment or not..) I didn't like the late 90s release of the same song as much hough, mind.  4. I'll have a listen and get back to you.. :)|`|96AQZUGyaa	I so know how you feel. None of my top bands get any talk-time here so I'll answer you!    I've never really noticed them to be honest. I heard "Can't Stop" once but I didn't know who sang it so I looked it up because I liked it. Then I listened to Californication and I liked that too, so yes, I do like this band. Not love, but like them. I'd say that Californication is my favourite song but to be honest I know only a few of their songs.    BA: No idea, I always picture him as a patriot because of that Born in the USA song (was that him?). Honestly I don't like his type of music so I wouldn't listen to that.    BA2: Pretty good. Looking forward to tomorrow more. 6.3/10    BA3: It is cheesy but the lyrics are pretty good. I know this song from a cover done by a nu-metal band Dope. Have a listen, its how the song should sound:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thC7AlLIt...    BA4: Its okay. Sorry, it holds no magic for me.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I am a regular here and I love the RHCP!    Tell Me Baby  Breaking the Girl  Snow (hey oh)  Hump de Bump  By The Way  Zephyr Song  Around the World  Californication  Dani California  Aeroplane    Favorite Albums - Stadium Arcadium and Blood Sugar Sex Magik    BQ:  When Bruce first arrived on the scene, I loved him a lot.  Fave songs:  Born to Run, The River.  Fave album:  The River.  Still love that album.  He is an awesome songwriter.  Some of his later work was too commercial for me.    BQ2:  Better than yesterday, thanks.    BQ3:  I loved it!!   Wiggling all over the place here now...  Thanx!    BQ4:  Like the original and other live versions I have heard better....|`|6LcHJbHjaa	Hi Lily,  I'm A TC Now!!!!!!! (hooray)    my favorite rhcp song is dani calfornia (suprise)    bq: i actually like his new song "working on a dream" quite a bit, and i like born in the usa but that's all    bq2: I had school off today due to the snow, so it's awesome.  You?    bq3: My mom loves that song, it's also in the wedding singer and i always laugh when that guy sings it.    bq4: i like the regular version more    *Edit* my favorite RHCP song is "Can't Stop" boy is this a tough choice though.

I use whatever the majority of my friends use, and they all seem to prefer facebook (which is weird, because now myspace is like a more colourful facebook clone)  We did all use myspace, but for some reason once people started turning 17 they jumped ship to facebook. My sister still uses myspace, but her friends are starting to jump ship to facebook too. I think there's some unwritten law in my town that once you reach a certain age you prefer facebook...apparently it's 'older'. *shrugs*|`|dK6QvcbIaa	Tagged

Umm no i don't normally care too much. Opinions are opinions|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	I don't worry about being PC...but I always, always try to hurt no one, cause no hard feelings...and to treat others as I wish to be treated.  If I hurt someone unintentionally, and realize it, I apologize right away...if I find out later, I try to make amends.

CuTvFlxTaa	It's called sods law...It always happens to me.|`|9qU9ojuDaa	my my that is unlucky' my electric toothbrush ran out after 20 years''? 3 days after the warrant''?|`|Z933rtuLaa	They're not programmed that way, they're tested that way!    Think of the IKEA adverts.  They tell you how many times they open and close their drawers, or how many times they "Doink" their beds before offering them for sale.    Manufacturers offer warranties for the length of time they have tested their products under heavy usage before they break.    If they know their product will work non-stop at full capacity for three years and one day, they will offer a three year warranty.  If they know it will work for three years and three hundred and sixty four days under the same conditions, they will offer a three year warranty.    All a warranty is, is a promise that they've made something wrong so they'll fix it or replace it.  If it breaks after their test period - that's your problem!|`|zYAgbF49aa	It's an unwritten law.  They don't make them like they used to because if they did they'd never sell new ones.|`|RJQlvMyMaa	Yes.....you are very LUCKY.....it's tuff being normal.  That happens in Russia too.  You should get a puppy.  Just bare your bum and get on with it.|`|lnZyIc6Haa	Happens to the best of us sometimes.  For a better deal when shopping for a new one...show more cleavage.  Maybe you'll save enough to get the extended warranty and put them on the hook this time.|`|AA10711210	It does seem like it.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	No. Like most people, you've got cause and effect backwards; the manufacturers know how long the item is likely to go without giving trouble so they guarantee it for that long. Having said that, built in obsolescence is a reality, and (as my gran used to say) things don't last like they used to. I always take out extended warranty on electrical items (unless it costs more than a replacement, allowing for depreciation) and so far I've never regretted it.|`|jN7SCNL6aa	Another one bites the dust.    That sounds about right.    Too bad...you're average, like the rest of us.|`|SzDlCwfTaa	Try breastfeeding in public next time.

7RUqEJzLaa	Hitler by far.  Osama is pretty bad too. He played a role in 9 11.  :(      edit- what is with the thumbs down ? do you not agree that hitler is the worst? because if you are then you're heartless. and Osama wasn't one of the hijackers on one of the planes during 9 11, he wasn't there but he played a ROLE. Just incase you don't know, because you cleary have no knowledge to whoever thumbed me down. :)|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Hitler|`|5d965c7b958bf0032081da6d0ae2cf56aa	Well, that's a close one.

OtobKO3Eaa	It seems like she's not sure of what she's supposed to be thinking about in general because people have lied to her.   "Please speak softly,or they will hear us,and they'll find out,why we don't trust them"  She doesn't know who to believe anymore. and she is confused   "I need to know, why we don't trust them"  She feels like everything is piling up and like when did she become like this, doubtful and when she realized that she really doesn't actually know what's true anymore.  "Explain to me,this conspiracy against me, yeah And tell me how,I lost my power, oh yeah"    She wants answers for what has happened to her and she wants to know when things started to go wrong, whilst she thoguht  that there was someone there to help her, a lover that maybe promised her that he would betheere for her no matter what happened between them, and that he'd help her with what she was feeling. She wants to know why maybe he is the one that lied to her.MHEeh, probably doesn't make sense, but this song really is beautiful---
ykyMSEKGaa	Vince Vaughn for sure.  His great quotes are legendary like:    "Hey, listen, Id offer you a ride in my limo, but I gotta stretch my **** out. Im a tall drink of water.

Can get away with different roles.   Ben Stiller is creative & thinks out of the box.  Owen Wilson is a believable airhead but pulls off serious roles as well.  Seth is the most real actor to surface . He is so honest with his character & comes off as not acting at all.He is my choice.

aog9gSm1aa	I live in the countryside, and love it so peaceful.|`|sfBKFSEfaa	City.  But I've lived in both and I prefer the countryside.|`|6Gx7Bnniaa	i live in the suburbs :) close to the countryside. i like the fast paced city life though.|`|MVsre29Caa	I'll say town, it definitely isn't city haha, it's waaay too small|`|wUodHpEuaa	I live in the suburbs about 90 minutes outside the city east of the country, and I like it, everything is here we need.|`|7dPm35LYaa	I live in the Country side :( I prefer the citybecausee there is so much going on and so many people to see. Where I live, I have to go such a long way just to get to a store or a mall. It kinda sucks.|`|4E2FYEHsaa	I live in the city, Gotham City! I like it here.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	I have lived in all 3...    In a small town of 20,000 - Not much to do, was an hour to a big city, but there was stores and stuff right near my home. Even had the a 2 screen movies too.    The forest (country) - 10 min drive to the nearest gas station, nothing to do other then outdoors stuff without taking a drive, couldn't really walk anyplace. Was 10min drive to the nearest town, similar to my old town. And then an hour drive to a real city.    And just 8 months ago to the city - and now, right in downtown austin texas! I want a pizza, i can walk across the street, starbucks? across the street. Walmart, about a mile. Bad thing is its too loud, i always hear the cops, its always light outside...    Overall, they all are good and bad....  Each has their perks and downfalls..    I am currently enjoying the city though, its no longer an hour and 15min drive to work and school.|`|AA12242211	I live in a town of 600.  Its not bad...its on a major highway and its about a half hour to an hour and a half away from 4 good size cities (one city in each direction)|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	I live in the suburbs and like it!|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	i live in the city and prefer the city, it's all I know. Plus everything's at your finger tips in the city. I know people who live in the county and everything's so far apart. The nearest store's couple miles out and . In the city there's always multiple stores no more than 3 blocks away. The city's more convenient.|`|XBohAsxoaa	city. city. lol|`|Pwybznsxaa	I live in the city but i would love to live in an area that's close to the city but looks like the country!|`|Hr4paf9uaa	I live in the city.

However, i wish to live in a countryside for a few months to experience country life.|`|Rodj52Swaa	city|`|wXCWdJKaaa	i live perfectly in between both. if you drive 6 miles one way, you get to Boston, if you drive about 6 miles the other way you are in the middle of the country.      i LOVE it.|`|HpClsuGpaa	I live in the suburban city, and I love it because you always meet interesting people from all over the world, there's always something to do, someone to see. failing that, it's always great to sit in a cafe & watch the world go by, wondering who each person is, where they're from etc. The city is always alive, at whatever hour. Whereas the countryside, although nice for a scenic change is less about the hustle & bustle and more about peace & quiet, not something I'm currently interested in to live by. lol|`|1RfCZQ1raa	I live in the city. And its actually quite hard for me to choose between them.     City has shopping malls. But lots and lots of air pollution and noises...  Countryside seems more relaxing and has fresh air... But lots of bugs and less convenient...    Um... I prefer city. Despite the fact of the noisy and air pollution. I love shopping malls. I would love to have a vacation house on the countryside just to hide away from the busy life of a city.     P.S: The sunglasses your avatar is wearing is cool. lol|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	City.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Suburbs, which is like the city - but you have the access of shrubbery too and communities and what not.

I like all the trees...I don't like the countryside because its all farms, no trees. I find it pretty awkward out there.  I like the city better, or large close knit towns...more fun because you can walk everywhere, and there is more stuff to do! I hate the suburbs. I have to get a ride everywhere, and there is nothing to do as a teenager. Sure, in the summer i can bike into town, but that takes forever because there aren't any sidewalks so its not safe.. I'm going to move into the city when I grow up XD|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	country    I love the country, but the city has it's perks too....not sure which I'd prefer...|`|71VRvldJaa	I grew up in the city and live in the city now but spent most of my life in the country and I'll take the country any day!|`|djuRlggeaa	suburbs. i prefer city bcuz countryside makes me naushes|`|eOb841qbaa	city, its the center of everything thats why lol. :)|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Suburb.

I can't believe some people are answering, "they're all right," as if they have a brain cell.
DtxamTPqaa	People have always told me I have a strong intuition.. and all things considered, I have to say go with your gut instinct, but continue to keep an open mind.    Because you dont have to like the guy, no one's asking you to like the guy. But what he tells you and suggests to you might be the right solutions. If what he tells you makes sense, and you like the idea, then go with it. If what he tells you still doesn't feel right, then take his suggestion and pocket it for a last resort.. in case you dont find any other solution to your problem.    Dont make a lifestyle of going with your instinct, but always consider them.
raU9c3tzaa	Vera! all humans do judge by their minds or heart. what we don't like to do is showing our judgment, or express it to the relevant or non-relevant person(s). and when we judge we judge actions of people as being moral or immoral, good or bad, beneficial or otherwise, especially we those action has something to do with our being.  Do, and go with what you see best. Good luck in your effort to lose those 20 pounds.

fTZYnoMHaa	People change when they want to, never before, and sometimes never at all.  But yes, people can change.  Life's happenings always come, and with it, hopefully a sense of enlightenment or experience that promotes self-growth.|`|B3qTbSOSaa	Can----Yes, Do-----usually not.     I do believe we adjust to fit our needs and if we are lucky, we adjust to fit the needs of those we love.....the ones who are worth it.|`|xeYNNoxfaa	People can change if they really want to or if there is a very strong reason to do so, like illness or the possibility of losing someone or something they love.    While a person's genetic behavioral tendencies may be constant, acting on them is not mandatory. None of us can fully explain the transformational miracle of change, but it happens everyday. Although that level of change, depends on the person's dedication and commitment.|`|c3Ep0Ky3aa	They can change.|`|xM4CumQoaa	everyone has the ability to change, you just have to be willing to try.|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Minor adjustments....leopards dont change theirs spots.|`|6ik7OJRNaa	People, do not really change....

'Yar what 'Yar, Just ask Pappy...Hee-Haw|`|H8RpSpuSaa	most of the time minor adjustments but in some cases i think people can change|`|e22b2bed2f6a9243c0dbb45697641a53aa	they can change for a little while but sooner or later they will revert back to their old ways|`|frjSBxzBaa	anyone can change its up to the person if they want to change     one has to look into the mirror and see if that is who they want to be for the rest of their lives if they are not pleased with what they see looking back them     I can say I am not the same person I was when I was 24 nor do I think I could ever allow myself to be that person again

Haven't smoked for years and years.|`|AA10077992	You were really part of the 'gang' if you lit up your ciggie on the Bunsen burner in the Chem.lab !    2nd floor toilets was another good bet as was the school bus.  Down the woods, back of the bike sheds - you name it  - we did it !|`|13b0ee2df2675456a4d60accfb6c703faa	it was at behind the schools arena|`|m7UyjPipaa	I smoked while running cross-country in High School.|`|xDdmnf80aa	In a large tree with friends, thoses were the days !|`|FCFQRAvCaa	When I was in HS, they had designated smoking areas for the students. Isn't that crazy? Way to discourage a bad habit. LOL.|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	yes i did in the toilets til they cracked down on that , then there was the bike shed but that was too risky , then there was the bush and the bins... i knew all the places|`|8fbd82f04b9ceeeda329cb7ba7bafcd7aa	We used to smoke behind the Geography room. (all girls school in the 1970's) Ah! Happy memories.|`|8mQVfDRqaa	I don't smoke :)    But they go loads of different places at my school.    In the toilets, by the science block...    but now they often smoke by the church before school starts.|`|aKhZNd7daa	Yep behind the bike sheds P, the girls toilets and right down at the bottom of the field !!  Oh god how I wished I'd never started now !!|`|xoZeL7PSaa	When I was in High School, I just smoked right in front of the school. Sometimes on the fourth floor where there were no classrooms|`|R4J6rucraa	they smoke outside the gate in our school|`|AJg9QZsaaa	It was in the toilets, we paid some younger kid to look out for us. We sprayed air freshener and sucked polo mints afterwards in the mistaken belief it would hide the smell!|`|AA10368738	We used to puff in the toilets in the playground, until one day there was a knock on the door & we asked for the password. "I`ll give you password" came the reply, it was our Science teacher.|`|K1zxY1raaa	We did it between the swimming pool and the science quad !!|`|sb5eIn87aa	i didn't start to smoke until i was 22, but the kids that did used to go out onto the field just beyond the playground, same as you i think more should be done to discourage them though..|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Back in my days, they didn't want us smoking in the bathrooms, so we had our own smoking area. Bad part about it was, when it rained we went in the bathrooms anyways.|`|DqbLx3hxaa	Right infront of the school on the sidewalk|`|lnUrm4sGaa	im a good girl i dont smoke but when i was at school the smokers went behind the sports hall|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I smoked in a fairly open nook beside the chemistry labs but in plain view of the main road.

yxoXTmlqaa	The movie spoke to me on a lot of levels, one is to not let anything control you.  I thought the character development, especially of Harry (JARED LETO FROM 30 SECOND TO MARS!), was excellent, and how structured the plot was.  I also like how it was broken up into seasons, made it a little bit more coherent.    I think everyone cried at one point in this movie.  Even men.  The part I cried at was when he was phoning his girlfriend from jail and he broke down crying, and when he had to get his arm aputated.  That was so sad.  This movie deserves an emmy.|`|nmbbG0vdaa	this movie is not actually about drugs....look at it from the creators point of view.....what do you think he was trying to say?

KZJIjrguaa	The Beatles are talented.    The Jonas Brothers are manufactured hype.    No, seriously, If you're a 10-year-old and you don't believe me, look in your history book, around the 1960s. I'm fairly certain you'll see Vietnam, The Space Race, and The Beatles. Seriously, do you really think the Jonas Brothers will be included in your kid's HISTORY BOOK 40 years from now?    The Beatles got MBEs, Paul was actually KNIGHTED... how can some bubble-gum Disney Channel band top that?    You could take someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard and air it on Disney Channel 8 hours a day, and I bet the fans would buy their CD as long as the person doing the scraping was good-looking.|`|1YV3e1ZEaa	I'm just sick of hearing about them all together.  And that goes for what's her name Cyrus, too.  Aghhhh.|`|ksTqkaZwaa	who are the beatles?|`|k7jGZydJaa	I think they just do that to annoy people.|`|7xoMXSEqaa	They have shiny hair!|`|xRkXbmI4aa	jona bros suck hard core... they need to get a life  eww  grow get a life and their ugly|`|wbytU9szaa	Just answered that question. Haha, how convenient.    Hate the JoBros, by the way.|`|FA8Sn0y5aa	i hate when people take things too seriously.|`|N0VI2D59aa	Yes... hate it.|`|z5tzI0Hwaa	I wannaa hold your haaand, i wanna hold your hand (8)  diffrent generations like different music i guess..|`|soNnNFa4aa	jonas brothers suck balls|`|USjEdqR2aa	Exactly.    They should really compare them to the Wiggles or something.|`|Sf1CDe54aa	exactly! Thank you!|`|20759ce8e8f715cd4d43fc23bca9a608aa	They just want attention.|`|WKYO5oxdaa	curly haired freaks|`|HZvo9YFHaa	its like when hansen was compared.|`|DDduZ5q5aa	I know why would they like some kid band??|`|e6657aae9a5e6165c0768975ea7fd38daa	i know i mean the johnas brothers suck big ones i don't know why they suck!!!!|`|dlpxaBCWaa	JONAS BROTHERS ALL THE WAY|`|75WoHlWxaa	Well if you removed all talent and innovation from the Beatles, dipped them in horse faeces and made their singing sound like a cat which just had a big spike nailed into it, then they could almost be comparable to the Jonas brothers.|`|DmkxJkUbaa	YES    I love the beatles     i HATE the JoBros|`|G7LIwt5Caa	Well aren't they both bands?  It's all their opinions which is being influenced by media.  You can't say that the Beatles or AC/DC  or whatever (I'm not a rock fan) are ACTUAL good bands because it's not a fact.|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	yeah.  cuz the JB suck a**.  hopefully they won't last much longer.  and what's with the one that looks like a leprechaun?  bleh.  and yeah, i would NEVER compare them to a band of that magnitude.  they don't deserve to be compared to the beatles.  they have been around for like a whole minute and where are their hit songs?  i've heard ONE song of their played on a top 40 radio station.|`|xoZeL7PSaa	I honestly don't know why all these young girls are in love with the Jonas Brothers, to mean they sound very whiny. But when I was a young girl I was in love with the Backstreet Boys (I know, it's terrible!) so I guess I was just as bad.|`|ybMfE2gSaa	I KNOW!    i've herd an even crazyier one... jonas brothers or led zepplin..which is more legendary!?      I ALMOST BROKE THE COMPUTER SCREEN READING THT ONE!|`|FS9ibKB5aa	who cares?  both are bands.  people are entitled to their own opinions.  no i don't hate when people compare jon as brothers to "actual" good bands...what i hate is when people have the nerve to try to speak for everyone.  in my opinion i don't like either of those bands however that doesn't mean that they arn't acually good bands. becuause i think both are good bands. im just not into them.|`|tTatLHnCaa	ok if you think they dont compare then you have lost your mind!! come on the Jonas Brothers may have a bunch of young girls screaming because they are cute, but if you look past the crazy girls you'll see three guys that love what they are doing and are really good at it!! they have their own style and i understand some people dont like it but to say they cant sompare to the beatles is obsurred.. dont get me wrong the beatles are great.. but people didnt seem to mind that girls liked them because of their looks!! I know the beatles are extremely talented, they are one of my favorites but i also like the Jonas Brothers and think people need to give them the credit they deserve.. they are great role models for young people too!!|`|u9uFdSrqaa	you suck jonas brothers are awesome|`|JbRTKDFmaa	It makes me laugh. Years ago it was teens comparing NSync and the Backstreet Boys to The Beatles.|`|i6uzNQcJaa	jonas brothers are little dick lickers|`|6pk6HnuSaa	I hate it when they even mention them ?|`|0p9wHjSWaa	My lil Witness likes the Jo Bros, but she would NEVER compare them to the likes of The Beatles, who truly have her heart.|`|gCoqslUGaa	yes! its so stupid!|`|3yNh5jO8aa	don't hate it...but they dont' compare!|`|6MCrTTRTaa	OMG YES!!!!! i know people HAVE lsot their minds  these Jonas Brother *** hags r wanna be pop/rock star people and it's not happining they need to go home and stay there!!!!!!!!!!|`|135b47dd06c37bc042aa0969ad35cb25aa	Sure|`|st2zmU88aa	Most of those questions are jokes..  i don't think anyone would seriously compare them to anyone good...    if they do then there is seriously something wrong with them.|`|y9GsC7ogaa	I could not agree with you more.    Here here...Cheers.|`|iE7nwMVnaa	Yes, people have lost their minds.|`|3MFsPmnaaa	Yes, but I hate it even more when they mention the Jonas Brothers.|`|B3N388wBaa	I get so pissed when they compare them to pretty much the Gods of classic rock!

Even if they are told by their peers. They haven't lost their minds, but they have just followed what mainstream gives them so they don't have a choice.|`|rBr9OOIeaa	hmm jonas brothers or the beatles umm    JONAS BROTHER BYYY FAAAAAAAAAR    beatles are horrible....!    go jonas    nick     i dont care becouse                        there                      always              better                        to                                  what                                  they                              compare                                they                                  dont                              compare                              themselves                                          that                                      much                                            GO JONAS!|`|J0h1TKkxaa	lol the jonas brothers dont stink and they arent that good either  i mean maybe the people who compare them to the beatles really feel that way...we all have opinions ...sometimes you have to get over it and grow up|`|e22b2bed2f6a9243c0dbb45697641a53aa	yes totally because the jonas brothers are not that good and joe just goes from one girl to another they should just put it up for good|`|lEjYhwxkaa	yes hate it.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	Who compares The Jonas Brothers to The Beatles?!

G4BSv4jbaa	In 1982, there was the US Festival in California that for some time was in the Guioness Book of World Records as the most attended outdoor concert. (Larger than Woodstock.)    One particular day exhibited a metal lineup that included a who's who of everyone who made teh Hard Rock/Metal genre huge. Van Halen headlined the festival and became the first artist ever to be paid more than one million dollars to perform at a concert. Also on this bill was Ozzy Osbourne, The Scorpions, Motley Crue, Dio, Quiet Riot, and I believe Judas Priest.|`|AA11452399	USA For Africa which stood for United Support of Artists was a charitable event to bring famine relief to Ethopia (mainly), and other African nations, quickly followed up in July 13, 1985 with Live Aid, the concert benefit for famine relief in Africa, organized by Bob Geldof. This was the biggest broadcast world event in history. The largest scale satellite link ups in history and the concert was held simultaneously in London's Wembley Stadium and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It reached some 60 countries and well over 400 million viewers via satellite. Many many famous artists performed, not sure if Def Leppard did, but you can probably look that up. These 2 events were major 80's events and they had everything to do with the rock & roll community as a whole and one of the biggest charities ever. It was a great success.Maybe you should check it out. This was history, not Def Leppard.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	How about the Live Aid 1985 concerts??    Edit: Oh and MJ is NOT a rapist!!|`|DibFrwxlaa	Person: Rick Allen  Event: Car Crash  Trend: Hair metal band members getting into car wrecks (see also: Vince Neil kills Razzle)    Rick Allen would be the drummer from Def Leppard.  Sorry, I was trying to be amusing since I have no idea how to actually answer your question.|`|524ae26534ddf801aecd5122aa2ed234aa	If you want an 80s event that ties in directly with Def Leppard, the obvious one would be when their drummer lost his right arm in a car crash in 1984.     More here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Allen_...|`|3Wg9nzVjaa	That concert was actually Live Aid and yes, it was huge.  MAJOR acts performing in huge concerts and on live TV from the US and England.  Tons of money was raised for hunger in Africa.  Not sure if Def Leppard was involved though.    Maybe you should change your person to Bob Geldof who was the singer for the Boomtown Rats.  He organized the whole thing and it definitely kicked off a trend of mega-concerts for charitable causes that is still going on today.

ZyGyDLsDaa	There always have been stupid and poor movies, even back to the beginning of filmmaking. You have to search for the good ones, depending on what type you like. There are many excellent films and not necessarily independent, as some claim. There are many poor indies, along with the good-to-excellent ones, just as there are mainstream movies.     Following are some standout movies I've seen, courtesy of my film journal notes:  May  Salvage  Neverwas  Bonneville  Jindabyne  Wind Chill  First Snow  Enchanted  Absolution  Deepwater  Miss Potter  The Lookout  The Fountain  Dark Corners  Paranoid Park  No Such Thing  The Kovak Box  10 Items or Less  Music and Lyrics  The Blue Butterfly  The Station Agent  Unconditional Love  Bridge to Terabithia  Youth Without Youth  Love and Other Disasters  Plain Dirty aka Briar Patch  The World's Fastest Indian  Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont  Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day  Paranoia: 1.0 aka One Point Oh  National Treasure: Book of Secrets (better than the first)    Likely, I could list many more movies. I can't comment on ones that haven't reached cable because I am unable to go to theaters anymore.     NOTE: I wrote the part about independent movies when there still were no posts. I disagree that indies are the only ones worthwhile! I get the IFC channel and others that show only indies; trust me, there are extremely poor independents, just as there are poor Hollywood-style movies.|`|MHHy90D5aa	yes you are right and there is many a good book out there that would be great as movie but do they do them no the remake remake remake ... which is very boring  because the first one is mostly the best x|`|AA11516222	It's you.  Everyone else is so stupid they don't notice.|`|zFwjZy53aa	I know they all have really lame story lines|`|OKmJWGGGaa	You just have to keep searching. I have found some good gems in the independent film industry.     The problem is, most of the story lines have already been done and once you watch the teenage jock fall in love with the school nerd for the hundredth time it gets a little boring.|`|K0SOqyAbaa	yepp some of the plots are just stupid.|`|vKFhmrQUaa	totally they just  remake the old ones and make stupid new ones i mean get an imagination every one has heard the story|`|29d696b2b163821f5d4e2854064c4a2faa	I have to agree with the person who said Indie Films are the best ones to look at. The problem with Hollywood is they are addicted to making money, and they try to look for films they will attract the majority audience in order to receive a great amount of money. Thats why I love the classic Hollywood where it wasn't just about that, where ideas were fresh!. Now they can put together any bull crap movie and make it sell! They have remakes which suck, and have sequels from films made 20 years ago!, I mean come on!|`|yqe0I5zpaa	No, look at some of the movies coming out.       Watchmen (Billy Crudup, Milan Akerman)  Terminator: Salvation (Christian Bale)  Public Enemies (Johnny Depp, Christian Bale)  Funny People (Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Eric Bana)  Observe & Report (Seth Rogen, Anna Faris)  Angels & Demons (Tom Hanks)  Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen (Shia Labeouf, Rainn Wilson, Megan Fox)        Look at the 2008 Academy Awards     - Slumdog Millionaire  - The Wrestler  - Milk  - The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button  - Frost/Nixon  - In Bruges  - The Dark Knight      I could go on, Hollywood has some great films out and coming out, you just have to look closer.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	The Film Industry has been going steadily downhill for the past 9 years so no it's not just You. When Hollywood isn't busy churning out colossally bad remakes way over half the films they do make are chock full of atrocious wooden acting, poorly thought out plots with more holes than a block of swiss cheese based on miserably bad screenplays, or dime a dozen horror films that pander to the very worst parts of the Human psyche (I.E. Hostel, which I heard referred to as "torture porn", an apt description in My opinion)    Yea, Hollywood has went way downhill since the 90's.|`|tegyqU6Raa	I think that is so true.

WMrNa3Doaa	Because we are all selfish, and relatively speaking, if that is a normal human trait, people seem less selfish when you compare them to others.    Even people who do good deeds would not do them if they didn't get some kind of good feeling out of it.  If it pleases you to donate money, and help those in need, then you are certainly getting joy from it. Some people need that feeling.    Basically, all actions are motivated by a selfish need, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It gives us drive and ambition to do better.|`|e7c2ae69762e95dde32cf6d10668ccfbaa	Really - are you sure?

Everyone has to think about themselves, not just for other people.    The only selfish people in the world are the ones who kill people and animals for no reason.|`|AJg9QZsaaa	For instance...?|`|Z03P3fLXaa	There can be so many reasons people do things and only some of them are for themselves.|`|A7r8xX7saa	Those are the people who have the philosophy that they shouldn't do charitable acts to be recognized for doing them, so they avoid letting people know their unselfish nature.|`|R4J6rucraa	because i said so....

0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	I grew up living a nomad existence due to my father's work.  Languages came with the territory so that is why I speak 5 fluently. I have had several jobs related to that, translating for politicians and scientists.    My father made me read books since very early age ( 5) and as I was an only child....that was sort of my parallel universe to feel less lonely. I have read hundreds of books ever since.   My mother is an Opera singer...so she made me play the piano and love music in general. I also liked to draw, paint, train athletics.....  All that makes me who I am, but it also proved to be complicated when I had to choose a profession.. I studied psychology ( full) and astrophysics (4 semesters), studied art in Florence and have been a professional painter for 20 years now. Currently I am writing  two books but also lyrics and poems ( some of them were recently made into rock songs, which is pretty cool).    But a dream job? That must be something totally different maybe?   Did not think about it back then, when I was a young woman with my freedom ahead of me........but today I would have to say......     Writing for some specialized magazine.....about luxury hotel accommodations? Cruises? Fancy restaurants?? Something really really eccentric and frivolous, well paid and fun, traveling all over the world? Seems pretty cool to me.     hahahahahahahaha....dreams are for free aren't they??|`|oRuGgrMHaa	actor when i was a child - property developer/interior designer now|`|LpMGGmFuaa	I wanted to be a firefighter or a comedian    I am a neuromuscular therapist now.

Ford Parts Specialist|`|AA11142708	I didn't have a dream job until 6th or 7th grade; that's when I started to get aptitude test results. I agreed with the results. I wanted to be a scientist. That lasted until my second or third year in university when I encountered the drama (for those with no aptitude) of  mathematics. Then my dream job turned into a five year struggle to become a janitor at a university. I applied in at least 15 universities. Calgary, Canada said they might be interested. I ended up in Tuscon, the University of Arizona. Later I got a job at the university where I did my schooling back in Michigan. I'm in my 31st year now. It's been a great ride. Thanks for the question.

If you like rock: The Killers("Brightside"), My Chemical Romance("Teenagers"), Nickelback("How you remind me"), Kaiser Chief("Oh my god"), and Blink 182("All the small things") I would recommend. If you like pop I would recommend Christina Aguilara("Fighter") or Pink ("Just like a pill") or other songs. My favorites are the albums of Lady Gaga, Eisley and the Ting Tings!|`|AA10767640	I'm into Hard Rock/Heavy Metal. So to answer the question, there's a tie between Slipknot's- "Psychosocial" and Annihilator's- "Army Of One".
wA8Dyhq7aa	You think we aren't seeing these things today?  $125-$400 ticket prices for concerts isn't "excessive?"  Heck, I saw the Eagles TWICE for $25 total, and the opening acts were Steve Miller & Eddie Money the first time and Jimmy Buffett the second time!    Also, look at the arrests of artists today.  You know, back in the 70s they weren't getting arrested the way they are today.     I don't see "old school rock & roll lifestyle" coming back, because I don't see that it ever left.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Maybe in the future, but definitely not now.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	hmmmmmmmm good question...    Right now I don't see it coming back for a very long time....Rock is a lot tamer now and WAY WAY more different...    We need another Axl Rose to break though to shake up the scene|`|gDxMoBl9aa	No Fonz, all the real Rock Stars are long gone. People these days are way too busy playing PS3 and texting to cultivate an awesome image of Rock Stardomness.|`|KEk728Gsaa	No. Most popular rock bands these days don't seem to be like that. Not that the trashing hotel room style personality was a bad thing. Most really popular bands nowadays just seem kinda wussy and emo, and care too much about their image to do "bad things". (Ex. Tokio Hotel, Fall Out Boy)|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	the music business does not work that way anymore, the only place a musician makes money is at concerts.|`|hIdzQoquaa	Gone for good. In fact it was dying in the 80's. Think about all the AOR songs centred around mortgages. Well, maybe not, but decadence was getting to be a little less popular.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	It better! I wanna expirience what my mom experienced! =]|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	It will most definitaly come back around eventually. Once people stop listening to the garbage pop on the radio and listen to the real music, it'll happen again. It's human nature to want to live in excess.|`|lUe4rReZaa	I don't see it coming back.  Music sales are in the crapper, and that was before the recession,  you just don't have the same kinds of "Monster" Album sales that you had back then.  Rappers are probably the closest thing we have to the "Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll" of old.
2vw48Whtaa	It seems that jokes that require a small amount of intelligence go right over people's heads.    It's best to be dumb on here.|`|YdXhZka8aa	If you're gonna keep posting here you should|`|3Nrb2CBXaa	ask them in a different category|`|4WCLWhaTaa	I guess it would depend on your definition of "great works" as Beowulf may be one of the most popular old poems I'm not sure great can really be contributed to the unknown author.   I was more impressed with the Ring of the Nibelung, myself. And being someone born after the 18th century, more so impressed by Tolkien's works. I prefer modern literature overall, being a supporter of my own era.     I have actually never had the occasion to read Dumas' work. And I didn't see your joke for either but if it included substituting Grendel for Grundle then maybe literature isn't the problem.  Just saying...|`|qZF4r71taa	Yes, please stop the madness.|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	yes stop, its boring|`|90MSfEGSaa	yes|`|AUsvrW8faa	I think you can ask whatever you like.

Lanolin:   In recent years research has concluded that not only is a 100% pure lanolin ointment or cream soothing to new mothers' nipples, or in this case "Trips" nipples, but it can also prevent nipple trauma by maintaining the internal moisture of the skin. For this same reason, it may also speed healing when nipple trauma is already present.|`|hVKqKjrjaa	Once the recommendations for treating sore nipples included drying the skin with a hair dryer or sun lamp. Then researchers discovered that healing is facilitated when the moisture already present in the nipple and aureole tissue is preserved. A moisture barrier applied to the injured area slows the evaporation of moisture naturally present in the skin. The resulting moist environment typically causes wounds to heal in 50 percent less time, without scab or crust formation|`|yM7YPmzSaa	Rookie mistake Trip - you need to cover them with mircopore tape (usually found in the first aid box)...nick some from work!!|`|oDGttkmLaa	They make nipple cream.

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay,  My head just feels in pain  I missed the bus and there'll be hell today,  I'm late for work again,  And even if I'm there, they'll all imply,   That I might not last the day,  And then you call me and it's not so bad,  It's not so bad.    And I want to thank you,  For giving me the best day of my life,  And oh, just to be with you,  Is giving me the best day of my life.    Pushed the door, I'm home at last,  And I'm soaking through and through,  Then you handed me a towel,  And all I see is you,  And even if my house falls down now,  I wouldn't have a clue,  Because you're near me.    And I want to thank you,  For giving me the best day of my life,  And oh, just to be with you,  Is giving me the best day of my life.

Especially if they associate with the same people you associate with. You don't want your friends in a position that makes them awkward, either.

Anyway, if the party is with people that like you, then it is sure to be a hit!|`|MGvN5xrNaa	Friend   2 for sure.

You don't want to go down that path!|`|FzhDVgzFaa	well, i would go with friend 2! its a better idea 2 let ur parents trust u, but on the other hand parties r alot more fun without adults!!!!

BGIsuNMTaa	I know, i didnt realise they was actually allowed to broadcast racist comments like that.   He really annoys me that Gaz, you've got to admit tough Anita is such a Victim "ok, i wont tell anyone", she needs to grow a back bone.|`|aKhZNd7daa	What a horrible little oik that Gaz is.  I reckon this storyline is set to run for quite a while longer !|`|6aw3naCNaa	I don't think its getting too heavy.    They are showing us what actually happens sometimes.     In the real world there are unfortunately lots of kids like gaz running about.    Hollyoaks always handle delicate storylines well so I think Gaz will get just what he deserves.|`|8NqQvOqQaa	yeah  i think the storyline is getting very serious  and alot of racist remarks are being made.  i find it kind of offensive but i guess thats the only way of showing how serious this issue is.|`|AA11504809	that gaz is an idiot. the storyline is only starting, he hasn't been in it long and he's done so much to that family. I hope he gets his comeuppance real soon but I think they'll drag it on. I think he'll end up terrorizing half of hollyoaks and then it'll be a case of "who killed gaz".|`|IOPNRXxfaa	It's very unrealistic, not the racism storyline but the character of Gaz is unrealistic. I dont like him, he scares me, haha, I'm so glad I dont know anyone like that. I don't think it's getting to heavy, I don't like what he did to Russ though that was mean.

So I will just keep it secret until after my Mum passes away in future years, then I may confide in one of my Brothers or Sisters about it then perhaps?|`|WFl6ErDMaa	Biteing rlly turns me on ;D|`|pIez7GvQaa	<im not saying anything>|`|jO3kC1jFaa	i watch porn i dont know lol|`|Tu9k6fiZaa	what is 'secret' mean to you?|`|0QR5sSICaa	It won't be deep and dark if I just cast it out on broad daylight and it's a SECRET, not to mention the deepest and darkest one I have, so I'm not telling.

I get you|`|OvmIhEeHaa	Not always, sometimes.    If it is something related to work, I have to think twice before I say what I really want to say, because it might come back and bite me in the behind, in that case sometimes silence is better.  When talking to my parents, silence is sometimes better, (they deserve to think they are right at least 90% of the time.)  :)|`|9a9D7PXUaa	i always speak my mind in the end   i told my college tutor what i really thought of her on the day i left i don't keep things like that Bottled up it only makes people stressed  to me its the only time its not appropriate if it involves family or friends unless it has gone to far     i think it is always good to speak your mind that way people cant get away with things     it feels good to speak my mind when the government is involved|`|MBPR4PX5aa	When I speak my mind it usually ends up coming out wrong...

Like for instance a few weeks ago some man I didn't know was trying to get into my condo to see if my radiator was leaking.  He bangs on the door and when I open it he doesn't even say Hi he's just like "I need to come in here".  I won't go into the story but needless to say he'll think twice about his behavior the next time he has to get business done.|`|ReV6Cj06aa	Unless it's one of those situations where I have the right to remain silent....I"ll talk talk talk|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	When it's important, I do, but it's often best to be seen but not heard.     Anytime that might severely affect/hurt someone else, anytime that really doesn't matter and you may get in trouble for disagreeing, etc.|`|R5eXKhmaaa	No, in fact, I'm just trying to learn to make my opinion known. And I'm not always too good at it, and end up having to apologize a lot. But I'm trying.
sgHvnxe2aa	I truly wish that someone would tell me....but even more so, I wish that  Y/A would DO something about it before they ruin this wonderful site for everyone!!!            It's like neglectful, indifferent parents letting their kids do whatever they want and not lifting a finger to put a stop to it, regardless of how many people are harmed by their BRATTY kids...They still do not want to lift a finger to do anything about it....and they refuse to be account-able to the vast majority of us who are just here to learn something new and have a good time for awhile.....I truly hold Y/A responsible for nnot stopping their little pet trolls from harassing the rest of us at will.  I don't understand why THEY don't take control of the situation. I could  care less about whatever psychological problems the trolls might have,  just so long as Y/A puts a stop to their garbage.....    A spoiled brat can be a spoiled brat as long as they want, so long as they have their tantrums in lock-down, so to speak, and they aren't being a pain to everyone else.... >:(    Y/A at least owes the rest of us that much, but they can't even show people the courtesy of a reply in response to a ridiculous "violation" -- All we get is a "form letter" telling us to refer to their comm.guidelines.  We are the ones who are PRESUMED GUILTY and must prove our-selves innocent and Y/A will NOT even show us the COURTESY of taking over-sight and control of their pet trolls...Maybe it's because the  trolls are acting as their voluntary "p.c.gestapo", going after people who  dare to have the WRONG political and spiritual beliefs....and that way, nobody can come back at Yahoo, charging them with far-left bigotry against those they disagree with....    Under my previous account, I posted a question in politics, it was a fun question about JEOPARDY FOR LIBERALS and I listed some possible categories, with the idea that those who answer would come up with other ideas for categories...It got deleted and I got violated. >:(  ....And very soon after I got started here again, I got violated for a Christian based question that I posted. There was absolutely nothing rude or inflamatory about it towards anyone...and I even put it here in p&s, because others have posted religious based questions here as well, but.....I got violated and Y/A never did ANYTHING on my behalf...    I can't for the life of me begin to know what it is that they are actually DOING as part of their job.  "behind the curtain", so to speak....except to tell us that they are "experiencing technical difficulties" -- AGAIN!!!!!    They owe us the courtesy of making themselves available  to us via a toll-free   since they will not give us a decent and direct response to any email, which THEY invite us to send in response to any "violation" that we have innocently incurred at the total WHIM of their pet trolls... >:(    I know this is long, but......
IizPFrELaa	Well you will never get the orange box here on P&S, if thats your goal you will never meet it as they dont believe in the orange boxes for this category    You need to concentrate on the "real" categories...why on earth would you want that orange target anyways...I gave mine up!

Then you don't have to worry about the annulment; you can have the whole ceremony, the party, the clothes, and it won't mean a thing!    Yes, definitely weird, in a unique way.  Probably should skip the wedding present part, though.|`|s5HmxvU3aa	Why go to the trouble just have a party. It would be cheaper than getting legally married and paying to get it annuled.

z3A8meCNaa	Yup.  Ik that's my constitution, and I'm glad it's there.  What's your point?  Idk if I get what you're trying to say.  Do you want us to be all like super patriotic and list off why that segment means the world to us? Sorry hun.  Not everyone's gonna be like that.  Are you from America?  Sorry but it almost sounds like you aren't.    But the part you highlighted, errr starred, was interesting.  Are you trying to say our government isn't working properly?  That being able to peacefully transition between leaders without warfare is bad?  Or perhaps it's too much to ask to even be able to choose our leader every 4 years is just too much.  Personnally I'm glad to be American.  Even with its flaws, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.  If you don't like it, go be somewhere else!|`|G5nSzRJqaa	Isn't that part of the Constitution or at least a messed up version?|`|2Zm03QGIaa	the constitution of the united states is amazing and powerful and we shall live by it forever. =]  there are also too many amendments to the constitution...they should've included it all in there the first time!|`|pNUtnoC8aa	America rocks, if people don't like it they aren't forced to live here.|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	too long|`|TudZYPN5aa	I'm sorry, but that was waaay too long.|`|YQLTdXhjaa	wow, can't read all that|`|acVPPTD2aa	I did not bother  Soreeh|`|O8XRgMu4aa	you really expect me to take my time and read all that?|`|zwNaZbKlaa	i didn't read it either...|`|ztzL7ntwaa	America rocks!|`|ahXIBlstaa	This is too long|`|djuRlggeaa	i agree with SlaM    please answer my latest question about podcasts. ty so much!|`|w4LKvr0daa	tl;dr.

But do you keep razors in your shed?  Cuz that sounds kinda like a personal problem to me...    Personally I think the machete I keep in my shed is the sharpest piece of equipment in there...    And as for any idiot who answers "the saw!", check it:   The saw cuts with serration, like lots of little teeth.  No saw comes sharp, because that actually makes them less effective.  The saw should tear through whatever you happen to be using it on (logs, chairs, bones, etc).  And you can't exactly sharpen a saw.  Don't even try it.|`|ea622aae931aa37548cf46b7aedafe84aa	ROFLMAO @ everybody's got one.

9nymzoOXaa	agreed, american humor.|`|kVDGsDuZaa	British Humour :)|`|N62uLMf3aa	BRITISH|`|wnkj0b41aa	American!    Yesterday my friend showed me some British SNL and it sucked.|`|HmWvy0oIaa	British humour!  It can get annoying after a while though.|`|bik6rJZkaa	American = Humor    British = Humour    I think it all depends on where you grow up, I choose American though.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	British; it's dryer and cleverer. It's just classier. American humor is stupid, a monkey could get it.... I think it just shows Americans as having low intellect.    Sorry but American 'in your face', silly comedy annoys me.|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	I like British comedy.  Monty Python (not much thinking involved there), Faulty Towers, Are You Being Served?, I grew up on those (watching them on PBS in Denver.)  I mainly stick to the BBC America channel so that I don't miss my shows.|`|UoDtGtiLaa	I like both    I love the insane off the wall comedy of American humor, we are just so happy and not afraid to do something, like you said the slapstick is genius    Now, as for British Humor, i love it just as much, i just love their sarcasm, and the fact that the jokes are so sophisticated sometimes that it takes you a while to think it over before you burst out laughing once you get it, they have wits on their side|`|9hFexadLaa	American, if you compare the British version of the Office to the American version, there is a big difference

You can't stop the world from doing what it's meant to do.    Go ahead...give me thumbs down. I don't care.|`|w4LKvr0daa	Never.      My father had an affair when I was very young, and it more or less ripped my entire family apart.     When I found out it was the most awful experience of my life, and I was only the kid, I can't imagine how my mother felt.        I would never want to put someone else through that pain.|`|wZa3qiSbaa	No I wouldn't it's not because I wouldn't get involve,I don't think a married man would get involved with me,my life is way too complicated|`|EggNmoRvaa	No, Cause if he's married and wants to play house with me then ask yourself " How many more is he play house with"? Besides they don't make men like they did in the 40's. That's when there were real GENTLEMEN, not what's out there now.|`|Ym9t6V0Kaa	noes|`|NJv2zKxnaa	Heck no!

AND more often than most would care to believe.|`|h0z5S6BSaa	Only sexually, never emotionally, that would be wrong.|`|I40vnqNyaa	No I wouldn't.  Its wrong to inject yourself into someone else's marriage.  As far as im concerned,  once someone is married,   they are off limits.  Full stop.|`|t0uIgY08aa	I have talked to a married man, he liked me and all, we hung out. But when we hung out it was because I was trying to counsel him on stayin with his wife and kids.

Definetly not.|`|KHL4N6mtaa	no, i've seen so many people get hurt just by being cheated on. i would definitely not get involved with someone who was married especially with kids.|`|76Wp8OINaa	No, I would not, I would not wish to tear apart a marriage.|`|MMBZYhu6aa	I would never!  That is sooo wrong!|`|CNLpTE2Zaa	no. i would not.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Nope, almost did once but he told me before anything major happened. Dropped him so fast.|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	Knowingly, NO! I wouldn't come inbetween a marriage, whether it were a happy one or not. If he can cheat with me, he'll do it to me... no thanks.    I prefer single guys, less hassle and all mine, I don't share my men, sorry.  However, i would date a guy with kids, just as long as he's not with the kids' mother. Been there, done that =)    Cheers =)|`|X6I49NUZaa	No, never. I never understood that, especially when married people divorce their current spouse for the one they were having an affair with. Helloooo if they cheated on their first spouse to be with you, what's going to stop them from doing it again?|`|EFlX4GYOaa	definitely not    (unless of course the spouse was VERY ill and had A LOT of Money)|`|jSPj3S6faa	Given the option, I would say, "No," because if I were serious about this person enough to contemplate marriage, she will have already proven her lack of faithfulness one time; so why not with me?|`|AA10269742	no, i dont wreck homes|`|afkygHMgaa	no|`|1vxM2zofaa	well i did once, i got hurt pretty bad, but i blamed myself for it, i shouldn't never got involved with a man with family|`|pF63IMyVaa	i wouldnt get involved with a married person. i have morals. as for divorcees i would be weary. if it didnt work out the first time what are the chances it'll work out the second time around?     my name isnt Angelina Jolie.|`|CxyXgoA5aa	Never.|`|ztzL7ntwaa	No, not ever. Married men are definitely off limits in my book!  =)|`|AgxtBVwoaa	Hell no! Don't ever get involved with another persons spouse.|`|a3ZZkY08aa	I would if the couple had no kids and the guy was still in the closet...so he married a girl to try to repress his tendencies...but that didnt work and he strayed away to men secretly|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	my friends have a friend who i recently met and have hung out with and stuff hes 22 and married and hes really cute but i know hes married so i would never do anything with him and i have to like think when i think hes cute like dont think like that cause hes married so its good to not think to much about those kinda things

AA11508090	Lost may not be the best television series ever (that goes to The Wire or The Sopranos for me personally) but it is certainly a fantastic show. From the pilot episode right up until the amazing start to season five, Lost really keeps your attention and keeps you guessing. Plus, it looks great, the acting is first class and the story virtually sprints past you at times it is so sharply written. Perhaps best of all though, Lost has a great sense of humour. Not only in some brilliant comic moments but also in knowing it is not an entirely serious show. Just listen to Curly's hilarious description of what has happened over the past four seasons when he talks to his mother in the second part of the fifth season's double bill opener - pure genius! And now the creators have decided it will be ending in less than 32 episodes we can all hope that all - or most - will be explained. Hhhhmmm, wait a minute, after writing all that, maybe Lost is the best TV show ever!|`|PM62kihUaa	I love it, but the start of season 5 really made my head spin!|`|AquY3KsWaa	Addicted to it, every time you think you've got the plot it changes.....does Dean77 know something the rest of us don't?????|`|k19933TAaa	yep=]|`|hvTw0Zfzaa	No. THE best TV show ever is Star Trek.|`|HK00RPDtaa	No, Supernatural is the best show ever :)|`|3fe0d36dfe874f978e205152d212f8cbaa	I agree.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	I disagree.  We wont know how good a show it is or isn't until it's over.|`|mgIh5G89aa	YES!!!!! 100% agree!   I |`|BtK9nSalaa	yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS THE BEST|`|tx6crPYOaa	i think it is too.  it's definitely kept my attention span. :]    it makes you really feel for the characters (i was depressed when charlie drowned, haha) and it's just 43096746248356032513124x more interesting than almost anything else on tv.|`|Lq9Q1rAgaa	it's well good cos it's really mysterious and you want to know what happens next and thats really good how they do that. x|`|NUGErTlzaa	It is fantastic.  I never watched it, but I heard so many good things about it, and then I got the first 3 seasons as a present for the holidays, finished them all in less than 2 weeks, just got the 4th season last week, so I can catch up on the 5th season now playing.  It is so addicting.  I don't know how I'll be able to wait each week for a new episode.  It's awesome!|`|8gMhcDIRaa	its amazing... never seen anything better!    true fans that have stuck with it will get their reward :)    lol soupy.... no, sorry i know just as much as the rest of you!     im just sure its going to be a great ending :)|`|xP4fTaXjaa	I couldn't agree more! I think that basis for all good television shows is good characterization, and that is exactly what Lost uses to its full advantage. The way each episode is centric of one character allows us time to fully understand each of the characters, rather than just allowing us to write each of them off as stereotypes. That combined with the intricate plot, with its so many twists and turns, and its exotic filming location equals a pretty damn good show. At least in my opinion. So glad there are others who share it!|`|7HrAwCXQaa	Just started getting into the show because I could not understand what all the hype was about and I gotta say its good!     I've been catching up on Fancast.com here is the link:    http://www.fancast.com/tv/Lost/93942/vid...

U8aXa8xEaa	In the beginning of the scene, Sun was rifling through her wallet and then she started looking through her datebook organizer.  Then she said "Here is her baby picture"  She might not have had a recent picture with her at the moment.    Daniel is a Physicist not a physician.  Desmond could not open the door for Sawyer because Des and Sawyer did not meet until a month after the crash.  The crash had not happened yet at that moment.  But Des and Daniel met in 1996 during one of Desmonds time travel flashes.  So Daniel took a chance and knocked again after Sawyer left.  He didn't know if it would work or not.  But it did.  We'll just have to wait and see why it worked.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	that's really interesting! I really don't know!    about Daniel talking to desmond - if you remeber in the last series Daniel had wrote in his book that Desmond is his constant so he is allowed to make contact with him to sort out the time travelling problems the island is experiencing.
Ds6eHeLwaa	Sounds like a compliment to me but I wouldn't go around telling everyone at school about it.

The young wife who steals the baby has a southern accent.  The young husband who also steals the baby is more Midwestern.  The younger crook who later steals the baby from the wife and husband who stole the baby also has a (probably fake) southern accent and is as dumb as a sack of rocks.  His big brother is equally stupid but has a California accent, which is totally implausible for brothers, but a great actor.  The father of the stolen baby, "Nathan Arizona," has an excellent Midwestern accent.  Everyone is appropriately hysterical throughout.    Another favorite with lots of fake accents is "Young Frankenstein," starring Gene Wilder as young Frankenstein, who pretends not to be related to old Frankenstein and spoofs all the old Frankenstein's monster movies as he goes along.  Igor has a British working class accent at least some of the time.  Frankenstein has an American girlfriend, his fiancee, plus a German girlfriend, Terry Garr, who has a terrific fake German accent.  And the police inspector's fake German accent is so wonderfully awful nobody can understand him, even in the movie, where they keep asking, "What?!"  And he has to repeat it with less of an accent.  My husband and I are always quoting lines from this movie.  If one of us doesn't want something after being offered, the other one will ask, quoting Chloris Leachman's great scene, "O-O-O-Ovaltine, perhaps?"  And the other then answers abruptly, "No, THANK YOU, Frau Blucher!"  Then the first one neighs like a demented horse.  If you haven't seen it, you must!    Then there's "Harvey," an ancient black and white thing starring Jimmy Stewart, where he's slightly insane and goes around with an invisible 6-foot tall white rabbit.    My children's favorite, growing up, was "What about Bob?" which has Bill Murray as Bob, who is also insane, but gets better, and his psychiatrist, who goes insane, is Richard Dreyfus.  I could watch that every day and still laugh every time.  They're both terrific actors.|`|23591cb1dc1cc496bc042a08bd0edf30aa	Nightmare in the ELM street|`|Ph3VrLikaa	visit http://www.hiindians.com/entertainment/m... to get list of best english movie websties.

"Thinking Of You"    Comparisons are easily done  Once you've had a taste of perfection  Like an apple hanging from a tree  I picked the ripest one  I still got the seed    You said move on   Where do I go  I guess second best  Is all I will know    Cause when I'm with him  I am thinking of you  Thinking of you   What you would do if  You were the one   Who was spending the night  Oh I wish that I  Was looking into your eyes    You're like an Indian summer  In the middle of winter  Like a hard candy   With a surprise center  How do I get better  Once I've had the best  You said there's  Tons of fish in the water  So the waters I will test    He kissed my lips  I taste your mouth  He pulled me in   I was disgusted with myself    Cause when I'm with him  I am thinking of you  Thinking of you   What you would do if  You were the one   Who was spending the night  Oh I wish that I  Was looking into...    You're the best  And yes I do regret  How I could let myself  Let you go  Now the lesson's learned  I touched it I was burned  Oh I think you should know    Cause when I'm with him  I am thinking of you  Thinking of you   What you would do if  You were the one   Who was spending the night  Oh I wish that I  Was looking into your eyes  Looking into your eyes   Looking into your eyes  Oh won't you walk through   And bust in the door   And take me away  Oh no more mistakes  Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay...      -Courtney|`|zuVENJd3aa	Thinking of You by Katy Perry

9ADVLFOnaa	I can't believe how brutal people are being on this question! and yes it is a question! I didn't know that but I know it goes on so much,  grew up in a household like that and also had a partner who was like that but it was more mental than physical but I know where my mind is at now, I got it together(ok I know I'm still daft lol) but I'm sane again too! :)    Here's a link for people to read :)    http://www.saferlancashire.co.uk/domesti...|`|8uIfskigaa	Actually here in Ireland is 1 in 3 & so many women hide it to be honest as they usually blame themselves & is such a stigma attached to it..I grew up in a family where I saw my mother go through so much & she left after 25 years of a hard marriage...I seen things a child should never have seen & mainly due to drinking the arguments...I was in a brilliant relationship for 6 years & when that finished I met a man on the rebound & had the most horrendous relationship but after our son was born at 2 weeks I left as was never going to raise my son in that environment..It was mental & physical abuse & looking back wonder why I stayed..just stayed on my own since & concentrated on raising my son & found myself again..I was such a happy young woman when I met my ex & slowly he changed all that but know who I am now & am confident within myself & would never put up with anything other than respect for me now..but it has left it''s mark to be honest..my son & I have such a close bond & am thankful I had the guts to leave as so many women are afraid & live in fear..Peace of mind counts for so much even though it can be tough at times raising a child alone but my son is happy & loved & I swore would never have drinking around my son ...great question from you :)|`|0PoyiLJWaa	men who beat women are sick twats|`|hLIV8fheaa	what's the question?|`|R4J6rucraa	i know now :)|`|VA3tGarQaa	you just made that statistic up. that's a ridiculously high number|`|KOrXPB9baa	I was :(|`|QV6swGUMaa	no but any man who hits a woman is on a pussy and should be locked up and tortured for it when in jail !!!!|`|0A47o6yNaa	I do now :/ It's a horrible thought.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	i believe it! im 1 of them!|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Yep. That is thanks to the psycho's in this world.|`|lTOeMNnraa	yup, my sisters friends mum left their family because of it. no joke|`|8gMhcDIRaa	this figure isnt correct...|`|JOAPnhOgaa	yes i know i lived in a refuge for women who suffered domestic violence for 22 month and believe me i met a loads of women and children and i heard their stories too|`|ybMfE2gSaa	this is not a question..  my answer: No, i did not know of this statistic (if it is accurate)    pretty sad though!|`|xuGwAlksaa	i don't even doubt it...i was... it's a horrible thing....but i think that emotional and psychological abuse could possibly be worse|`|gefna9D7aa	Yes i was many years ago and know quite a few woman who still are.x|`|it3ecbVEaa	yes i  can believe it i was in an abusive relationship for 4 years..|`|sb5eIn87aa	yes i do,|`|lnUrm4sGaa	yes i know i was a victim of violence with my ex partner|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I would've hoped that the figure wasn't that high.

Though if you hit me I'll hit back.|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	i don't wanna watch that bonkers and i no only to well my dad was a bastard so i grew up with a wife beater...  how can people be digging you out on this ask  OMG people it goes on everyday|`|eHUXcYZhaa	That is not true and that is very irresponsible of you because it is such a serious issue. Where are you getting your statistics from anyway?|`|mUed9bXYaa	unfortunately yes i did know...|`|smA22aNHaa	Only a coward would beat on a woman. Men like me beat on cowards who beat on women.|`|qZF4r71taa	Yes, my sister's friend's cousin's best friend was raped last night.|`|AA11309717	No I didn't know that. Men who beat women should be subjected to a long long time in prison with no chance of ever getting out|`|NqlWkqm9aa	Thats not true...get a proper source and I'll believe you, problem is that you can't because its not true. And this isn't a question either.       EDIT: I'm 14 so to answer your question, no I am not a wife beater. But seriously just use your head. So lets just take 8 girls that I know. Are you trying to tell me that 2 of these are going to be beaten by men?

97b1eabbf6a69ffaaaf71e3e35e00707aa	I'm right there with you. I have no opinion on hot "hot" he is consider i'm a dude. lol. But he does look very young. Check out these vids about the cast. It's a complaints:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJrjciM7R...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y_c4e2p4...    Personally, I'm almost hesitant to see the movie because I feel it wil be too "kiddish" there are many Avatar lovers who are above 12 years old. I'm 18. Many of the people I know are in their 20's and 30's love the show. Mike Shaylamin(the director of Stuart Little) is directing it. the dude makes kids movies. I really don't think he can pull off a great action movie especially after that amazing finale of Avatar....just my opinion. :-)|`|7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	No. It's typical racism on Hollywood's part to cast all white leads for a movie based on a cartoon not simply influenced by Asian cultures, but completely soaked in it.  I hope either the ignorant minds at Paramount come to their senses, or the movie flops badly. I hope people don't go see this movie.  When I think Hollywood can't get any worse when it comes to going out of their way to avoid casting Asian-Americans in anything but stereotypical roles (that is, when they cast them at all), along comes some crap like this.|`|GJIWrangaa	I dont really like the casting for Zuko.  I dont think will be seeing a picture of Ringer until hes on set and in costume.  Other then Zuko the cast looks pretty good

8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Like a movie in Spanish or a movie from Spain?    "Spirit of the Beehive" is both.  Also it has no violence or nudity unlike most other movies I would recommend.  And it is Spain's best movie ever.

WkSjf4PQaa	I watched it the other day. I wasn't impressed really.  I'm actually a massive fan of Pete's music, and from what I've seen of him in most interviews and his work, he seems like a genuinely good person.  However, I don't think this was well made, and because there wasn't really many interesting questions asked for him to answer, Pete came across as someone who was just distant (whether this was drugs or not doesn't really matter) and a bit dull. This isn't what he's normally like, and I don't know if this was the fault of the MTV crew, or Pete himself, or both, but I can't say I enjoyed the show much at all.  Saying that, it's not changed my opinion of him, I still think he's great. He really just has to work as hard as he can to rid himself of his addictions, and concentrate more on what he does best.|`|76a2abe8e583e9295d0577810103916baa	I didn't watch.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	not watching|`|gKnPpVgUaa	nope|`|ufSXgO1Baa	Er...no.

KVwJCwnRaa	All events in the chicken's entire life are fixed in 4-dimensional space time and the chicken could not have done anything else at that time (as we see things from within ordinary experience) than what it did; the chicken crossed the road because the chicken's crossing the road has been part of the eternally fixed micro structure of the 4-d block universe from the moment of its creation.     Well, here is an interesting fact... You see, my uncle was sitting at home one day, watching TV, when an ostrich popped out of his refrigeorator and threw a rock shaped like the state of Kentucky, at my uncle's lamp. It missed the lamp and hit his pet raccoon. The raccoon got very scared and pee'd all over my uncle's stereo. This caused an electrical shockwave, and fried his TV circuit. My uncle got furious and ran outside, got on his unicycle and rode away to my house. He walked in the front door, hit my brother in the head with a pocahontas doll, and knocked him out. He grabbed my TV and headed for the door. I was eating my noodles when this all happened so I threw my fork at my uncle. It hit his ear and he dropped the TV. The TV landed on a rake. The rake flew into the air and hit a telephone wire, which made all the birds sitting atop the wire, fly away. There just so happened to be a hunter sitting nearby, and seeing all these birds made him "get ideas" he shot one of the birds which fell out of the air and landed in a bald man's ice cream. The man started to scream and burst into flames! This man's pet chicken got scared of the man, who was now on fire, and ran across the road. The chicken was then abducted by aliens, but the government didn't want people to panic so they denied the whole thing, that's why so many people think its a mystery what happened to the chicken, did it get hit by a car? a truck? struck by lightening? LET ME TELL YOU, it was abducted by an alien named Joe. Joe the alien. That's right, be afraid. ROCK ON!!!

4WCLWhaTaa	What or who?    Because no one really knows what IT is (Stephen King) as for the who, though he only showed up in the last story really Professor Moriarty is a good villain...so is Admiral Thrawn and Hunter Rose (the first incarnation of Grendel). Those are pretty much the only non carbon copy villains I can think of off hand.   Hannibal Lecter was good in the Silence of the Lambs but he became more of a gore icon than an intelligent villain in the movies that followed...sad really.   Kind of the same holds true for Jigsaw.|`|YW1DXceqaa	Joker....because he's exactly like me =P|`|3yNh5jO8aa	Joker- he's the epitome of evil. he does evil for no reason other than the fact that he enjoys it.|`|qZF4r71taa	Bugs Bunny, because he always gets the other characters hurt.|`|UL3sHgqNaa	The Shark from Jaws.

Aaliyah- she was such a beautiful person inside AND out, and she was talented with her singing. her death was soo unexpected and senseless, and that is what makes it so sad. it will be 8 years this august that she has been gone; i think she would've been 30 years old=( such a beautiful young black woman. it makes you think what she would be doing with her life now.    3. notorious BIG- he was such an icon in the hip-hop community and world wide. he really made a name for himself, and to die at the age of 24 is just horrendous; it makes no sense! senseless violence! and the fact that NO ONE has found his killer or killers is beyond me; there is a reason for this stupidness, i just dont know what it is. i think people actually knew about it but they were either taken off of the police force OR they decided to quit because they were dumbfounded at the fact that they were now allowed to take the case further.

It may help us to remember not to do stuff like that again (except for about half a dozen incidences since), but it doesn't make anyone happy, and it makes a lot of people feel guilty.  I feel sorry for the Germans today for this; hardly any of them from that era are still alive, and only a few Germans actually actively helped to make the Holocaust a reality... yet Germans will forever be blamed for it: THE GERMANS CREATED THE HOLOCAUST!!!      And they aren't being blamed because it is their fault, which it isn't; they are being blamed because its so fun for the modern descendents of Holocaust survivors to justify themselves in their countless attempts at running down the Germans of today.      PS - Anyone else seen, in real life, the cans of the actual stuff they used?  I have seen several cans of Zyklon B.

That one is hard as a loner.|`|rCnYXtqTaa	Cause my butt is ugly. But I would love to take a good pic of YOUR butt!|`|AA11335301	Probably using the wrong lens. If the camera is too close, it will make your butt look elongated, just like it does to so many peoples' noses when they reach up with their camera and take a pic of their own face. The lens is meant for photographing something a little further away.    Set the resolution on high, then set the timer, move away from the camera about ten feet, and bend over.    Then, crop the pic and zoom it. Voila. Much better. And we will all LOVE to see the results.|`|7iwVX51saa	My ravioli is cold.    But that's okay cuz it's at home in the fridge and I'm at work eating something else.|`|imXPYucSaa	um, its probably too close.  use the timer thing on your camera and stand further away.  experiment with  the angles.  haha.  good luck.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	my butt always has red eye|`|gVYfFSpRaa	I've honestly never tried.|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Clearly that first guy up there has never had the pleasure of seeing your fabulously perfect buttocks.

I think they'll stay friends, not necessarily BFF    I think they'll have a huge fight, but it'll probably not be reported in the press, theyll probably still be like 'BFF's to us|`|vKFhmrQUaa	their both awesome but selena gomez is totally better she has an awesome wardrobe|`|Kycb8YH0aa	None of the Above.

d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	EADG are the first 4 strings from the top down, those are the 4 strings on a bass. The notes are exactly the same. chords are a bit different because you have only 4 strings. Usually though, most people don't use chords on the bass, they use scales to play bass riffs. Check youtube for bass lessons.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Not really the same, it's bass so it's different octaves and such. Also bass guitars have 4 strings (sometimes 5), whereas a normal guitar has 6. Why not just sell the acoustic and get a real bass?|`|CcYpcSb1aa	A guitar uses a combination of strings to produce notes, a bass guitar's strings produce whole notes.  two different ways of playing.

CdodhnP5aa	Please..you know...    The cousin wants to be all flirty with you and is probably a little on the whoreish side. Lets just get this part straight, if you have no "plans" with the cousin I would definitely not allow her to sit on your lap, I mean really your not Santa, and if I was the gf I would of been pissed but more pissed at you, your my man.  The cousin is slutty so if you wanna cheat on your gf the slutty cuzo has given you the green light, if you want to be with your gf tell the b***$ to back off or when she comes around you she will keep acting like a cat in heat.

Here is their site http://www.braintree.gov.uk/Braintree/bu...|`|FDt7cC8haa	It is not just the license....You also need to actually own all the music.

AbRfd29Haa	Oh man yeah.. Buckethead is a brilliant guitarist. And I say this as a guitarist myself... if I ever met the guy, I'd have to do the "I'm not not worthy" thing :-)  Listen to that.. he knows where to play and where to not play.. so many "guitar heroes" these days are only shredders. <br>  <br>  It's not just his playing (well, mostly). He's managed to rise to this level wearing a KFC bucket and a mask... so he can actually go to the mall and not have to deal with the whole downside of fame. That's a cool way to do it. <br>  <br>  And he seems to be doing it for the art. So maybe he's not usually on the radio.. so what. So much of the most popular music is just drek -- singers who look good on camera with producers who know how to sell to 13-year-olds. He's following the trail blazed by guys like Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Joe Satriani, etc. who are making a good living, but doing it for the art primarily.|`|aK7BmcWqaa	Sounds Nice! :)

9VaWal2Daa	well, I already have no sense of smell whatsoever........damn nose problems all my life..............<br>  <br>  but being deaf would definitely suck,    Life without music, is a mistake.........the laughter of children.......being able to hear the words, I love you..............a speeding ambulance about to run your sorry deaf butt over................<br>  <br>  yeah, I could deal with loss of sight........but loss of hearing has got to be hard.|`|AA11989999	Sight, because our world requires it for navigating around, driving a car, using a computer, etc. <br>  <br>    But there is an inner sense--knowing where your body parts are and how they are moving .  They are called proprioception and kinesthetic sense. Without them all our movements would be spastic and we couldn't even use a cell phone, type, etc., or function at all in the world.|`|54601f6ca2b038fe7a92154c08ebd2c9aa	The sense of sound?    That must be the 7th sense....<br>  <br>  *ducks to avoid shoe*  I am quick like G.W. <br>  <br>  I think I would go crazy if I lost my hearing and had no way to drowned out my inner dialogue.<br>  The voices in my head do not have mute buttons. They do however have a love of music. Without it they would surely revolt. One of my favorite things to do is sit and listen to live acoustic music. I would still be able to enjoy that even if all the others senses were gone.|`|d76Mz5c0aa	touch and sight<br>  i would be able to hold my <br>  boyfriend and look into his <br>  dark eyes o.o T.T<br>  i woulndt be able to get on my compi....<br>  o.o!!!!|`|BKr3y30maa	Definetly sight!

No sound, no music.<br>  You might still feel the vibrations of sound even if you can't hear it, but that's just a pale imitation of the original.<br>  If you lose your sight, your other senses get a boost after time.  That may not be so bad.<br>  Losing your sense of touch may be the most dangerous.  Without that, you wouldn't feel pain, which is how the body tells you that you're in danger.  You wouldn't be able to feel heat or cold, so you could die of overexposure without even knowing it.<br>  Hmm.  Losing the sense of smell might be a good thing depending on your job.  But I think if you lose smell, you also lose taste.  (I've heard that if you hold your nose and eat an apple, it has about the same amount of taste as a potato)<br>  And I can't imagine losing taste.  If you don't have taste, then there's no point in drinking Root Beer and without root beer ... well, there's just no point in living.  And on top of that, all of your clothes would no longer match and your curtains and wallpaper would just be dreadful.|`|3j7WE8jGaa	I think it's a close run thing between sight and hearing/sound for me on this one....when I have seen questions on here in the past asking which would be the worst to lose between these two, I think I have always said that losing my sight would be the worst, but I find it very hard to imagine life without being able to hear....especially because music has always been such a huge part of my life....from the age of about 3 or 4.<br>  <br>  It's a very tough call....but I still have a feeling that losing my sight might be the hardest on a practical level.|`|QEqGukjZaa	sight and touch are two i hate to lose..its a tie between those two|`|o0Badlndaa	sight

They give my legs good exercise. You have to generate the power yourself, and if your not strong enough to ride fast enough, or even keep riding for a long period of time then it's your loss. Motorcycles are just powered by gasoline, you just sit there.          Yea;; it would be really fun to ride a motorcycle. But technically you'd be trying to get your way out of doing all the work.        So my point is    Bike riding and Bicycles are NOT wimpy. Your not a wimp because you want to get fit.|`|PUKaYxmQaa	Bicycles

The levels don't really mean anything... you don't really have to uphold some level 7 standard or anything.

You'd definitely be wasting your time by listening to them, but if you feel you must, then look them up on youtube, I wouldn't go buying their music right away.|`|TCehI17kaa	They are a Teen Group that is supported by Disney. I never really saw them sing with the exception of them singing once during a Dallas Cowboys game. But with them alot of people either love them or hate them. For me I'm indifferent to them as i don't like or hate them even though i used them to make some jokes on the P&S Section.|`|f6dxZXPGaa	Crazy teens who don't have life started a band to fool the kids around the world.... <br>  <br>  Just like Miley Cyrus , Made by Disney Corporation to fool kids and make money!|`|2fGHF3RQaa	I think they're some kind of punk kids that sing, but I starred this so Scooter may be along soon, he talks about them all the time.|`|rMB71kZ8aa	I have no clue as to who the Jonas Brothers are.|`|YV2n51hqaa	Yes, It is a disney music group made of supposedly pretty boys.

They're about a half-step up from a neighborhood garage band.<br>  Their popularity is due to superb Disney marketing practices and nothing else.

6HyFHrfIaa	Sometimes. Aquarius cannot handle rejection very well (Probably the most surprisingly emotional Air sign, considering Air sign personalities do not show much emotions). If they forgive, it will be because someone told them to do it or they just "forgive" for the sake of avoiding future problems.|`|G3lkvGfDaa	That depends.  It varies from Aquarian to Aquarian.  You'd have to look in-depth into their birth charts.  Typically speaking, I don't think so.|`|AsLTO8CTaa	depending on what you did. if it was something small they will forgive but if u betrayed them or lied in anyway they will hold a grudge|`|IJiJbtATaa	hold grudges|`|o4T0dScfaa	I have not spoken with my cousin in 5 years. I didn't even do anything wrong, she did. She does not see it that way and has not tried to contact me (I have not tried to contact her either).... so i'd say they hold grudges and it could be for a lifetime. It makes me sad but I'm stubborn. <br>  Good luck!|`|dsBCGbWpaa	I'm an aquarius and I deffinately hold grudges. I'm not psycho about it, but I never trust someone again after they've betrayed my trust. Best of luck!|`|qiq95Yz7aa	yea, imma go with hold grudges.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	I would say that it depends what you did. Aquarius people usually forgive.

zetxxZWUaa	The original was actually pretty entertaining even though it was made in the 80's. The remake, as a matter a fact, i watched last night because i hadn't seen it in a while. It is distubing (gory mostly) but if you've never seen it before it'll be a little scary.    Basically, these people are trying to make their way to California, they take a shortcut which ends them in the middle of the desert and a bunch of mutant humanoids kill them one by one, they fight back and just a bunch of mindless killings happens. At the end only 3 in a half people survive.|`|CtL4oAZtaa	it wasent scary it was weird you should watch it yes it can get gross but it was fun to watch

4oBCEkheaa	It depends  If your in love you feel so happy so it would be false  however if u break up then its true    right now my heart is brokwn so im gonna say true|`|4U459LXpaa	It totally depends . . .|`|51Fmu8zkaa	false|`|sWLRSa6Caa	Absolutely true...nothing imperfect can be attached to or contained within perfection.  Of course, i am speaking of Divine Love.    i am Sirius|`|grwtwPbAaa	When I think of love on earth...False  I believe that love stretches our hearts...like elastic bands...Stretches as we develop love, compassion, understanding...joys ...all   the languages of love  stretch us....    Love can hurt....but in a good way....first it penetrates us, it can challenge us, tear down fortresses ....strongholds of wrong...all of this can hurt...but then love builds it's dwelling place....it is here that we enjoy the glories of love!     When I think of Jesus ~ False ....I know love hurt him as he hung on that cross and died for the sins of the world!  But the good exchange here...was so tha mankind could have eternity spent with Him!      God bless you:)|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	False.  It is not the 'love' that hurts but, those involved and that which they do to each other, in the name of love.|`|DN3lPdE0aa	falsee|`|FgU7wYDSaa	False|`|S9bEtVCSaa	According to the PSA "Love should not hurt."|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Love of course hurts, but without giving any sort of pain. It gives inner happiness.|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	False.|`|pKrsOPOkaa	It depends.  But it usually ends up being true.  :P|`|MzKTLRgpaa	Real LOVE is not a feeling of pain or pleasure... it is an expression of passion! ;-)|`|lj8PbJugaa	Love doesn't hurt.  Losing your love hurts.|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	"FALSE"! It hurts like hell!|`|fmHyfVmVaa	It's the expectations we place on the one we love that cause pain. True Love, the kind that transcends, has no other agenda than to Love.   Blessings!|`|k3LbhASGaa	true love does not hurt , it is when the love runs out and a heart is broke the pain comes|`|E870WbAsaa	True love does    :)|`|H8RpSpuSaa	false..
Fo9ADQLBaa	In my life, this has followed much suffering.  How would we know and truly appreciate this, otherwise?  Love is a different kind of jubilation and must stand the test of time and suffering. :D|`|E870WbAsaa	shower of suffering|`|h6rf1Ke5aa	shower of love..?    im sorry i dont understand your question..|`|MzKTLRgpaa	A rainbow of color occurs when the radiant light of the sun reflects it's essence within the moisture (experience) of the recent shower... and it arcs thru the sky of love. ;-)    Ok ok... so it was fun to dabble with imagery there! ;-)
DP8mnHIraa	hi chris ,what crap book <br>  did that come from?<br>  no i disagree 85% of it anyway,<br>  yes we have choices and sometimes we <br>  bring on a bit of crap to our selves ,true yes,<br>  but then life is like a big game ,you can only <br>  play the best way you know how ,bad and all<br>  x x x|`|i3S10DUqaa	Well, with certain things I do agree, but with others I cannot.  I am not accepted by conventional people in society because of already-established ideals.  However, it's my fault for not going along with those ideals, but just because everyone else goes with them doesn't mean they're right... T.T+|`|auFmP7J1aa	No.<br>  <br>  If someone you love gets in a car accident,<br>  and you feel horrible and life sucks <br>  cause you miss them, it's not your fault<br>  that they got into that accident.|`|Kj8J3clpaa	i want to agree but i cant because like the other girl said, some things in life are uncontrollable. like cancer and other diseases. (unless its lung cancer that you caused by smoking)|`|e6JRzlpRaa	I do not agree with that statement!! The worst thing that has ever happened to me is a rare terminal illness. There is no known cause and no known cure. Can't see how I brought that on myself!!!!|`|UYCvwh6Paa	Disagree.<br>  Outside influences can ruin things too.|`|mwv79AIhaa	not all of them are completely my fault, some of em have others blame in em...but bottom line is ive learned from my mistake.|`|6PMGheWxaa	well i was homeless growing up, and i dont quite think that was my fault. my dad left my mom with 4 kids.|`|AA11199881	I don't agree, some of the bad things in my life were at the hands of others, I didn't ask my husband to cheat on me never gave him any reason to either, Didn't ask for my mother to die suddenly, didn't ask to be in a car accident that nearly cost me and my unborn childs life.<br>  <br>  So No I don't agree with this answer there is lots more stuff I could list that has happened to me but I won't|`|YrdUWtSCaa	I do not agree... Yes, It's true that we bring a lot of things on to ourselves, but also a lot of things happen that are out of our control.  Such as, death, accidents, other people's careless acts.  You can't control fate and other people.  But we do "reap what we sew"|`|jPCSG92Faa	Totally agree. We are the masters of our own destiny and the bad stuff that happens  happens because of the bad choices we make. Simple.|`|I5AkYjUcaa	Nah<br>  <br>  Sometimes there is some bad things happen to you and it wasn't your fault it's because some people were planning stupid|`|LSNffo4jaa	Disagree- terrible things happen to good people every day and it's not their fault.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	yeah all most anyways, at least with the decisions i made yeah  i can not be at fault for the way my ex is turning into her mom|`|IpgzUP8Raa	no...so when a bus hits someone it's their fault?...when someone dies of cancer it's their fault?|`|50B4ckpzaa	i do agree.|`|tAN2R0NYaa	Yep, pretty much right|`|USjEdqR2aa	I disagree. My mom use to gamble and thanks to her we lost a lot of things. I'm pretty sure that wasn't my fault..|`|AA10971919	what horse poo.....being mugged....your willy falling off!!|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	absolutely...that is the only way it can be and the only way you can ever have peace.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	nope i cant agree ,why ...cause i was abused and it wasn't my fault it was his,cause he was so wrong for hitting me when he got drunk,i didn't make him do it,and didn't do nothing to make him hit me,not to be telling you all this but it was just apart of my past i cant forget,and it kind of come to mind,,|`|NKuQh4sSaa	I disagree . I have had some bad things happen in my life and they weren't my fault. Me getting cancer was not my fault and my son having autism is not his fault or mine. It is just one of lifes little f*ck ups. that is the way I see it.|`|U7d3Ft9baa	i agree til certain  extension but because there are lots of situations and circumstances that i can not control.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	I agree|`|AA11713693	No because It takes two to start an argument.

Too embarrassed to explain it.    d|`|CApnEZ83aa	No, I am not embarrassed of any family member.  Sometimes I am embarrassed of their behavior, though.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Yes, most of my family are complete wastes of time and embarrassing to know. They say you can't pick your family..|`|4EZcG3YSaa	yes, at times, but Im not going to divulge!|`|NKuQh4sSaa	Yes there are a few family members and friends that I am ashamed of and embarrassed of. I will be glad to be moving to get away from them and I won't be giving them my new address or my phone number|`|43JgLpkKaa	yes ...... doesn't everyone have one ??|`|ajaZr8Axaa	Yes, my psychotic sister.  Among all of her other...um...traits, she's a compulsive liar--the kind of person who'll lie about going to Wal-Mart to buy socks or something equally meaningless, just to have something to say.  She likes to tell people about these so-called experiences she's had, and it's obvious everybody in the room wants to say, "Yeah, I saw that movie as well."  She doesn't have sense enough to be embarrassed by her behavior, so everybody else is embarrassed for her and it's really annoying.

My gf wont play TF2 though, tis so sad :(|`|IWWva5vNaa	No!

I rarely ask questions looking for bands or recommendations, so when I do I *really* want to know the answer.    I've learned about some awesome bands, albums and tunes from people in this section.|`|DibFrwxlaa	If I've heard of the bands I mention something.  If I don't know them, which is usually the case, I ignore the question.    I think that kind of question is pretty worthless anyway.  If I like A and you like A it doesn't necessarily follow that because I like B you will like B as well.

The brain is very plastic. New neural pathways will form. You can compensate, but you're going to need a lot of patience with yourself.    I just started reading a wonderful book called "The Brain that Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science" by Norman Doidge.  Here's a review from Oliver Sacks (someone I respect a lot):    Doidge's book is a remarkable and hopeful portrait of the endless adaptability of the human brain.... Only a few decades ago, scientists considered the brain to be fixed or 'hardwired,' and considered most forms of brain damage, therefore to be incurable. Dr. Doidge, an eminent psychiatrist and researcher, was struck by how his patients' own trnasformations belied this, and set out to explore the new science of plasticity by interviewing both scientific pioneers in neuroscience and patients who have benefitted from neurorehabilitation. He describes in fascinating personal narratives how the brain, far from being fixed. has remarkable powers of changing its own structure and compensating for even the most challenging neurological conditions.|`|XjcrMNBuaa	so does weed...lol...and i am still good  i think ur gonna be fine babe...try not to worry so much  =)|`|2PTlXs9zaa	I just know I'm already retarted and I've never even had chemo.. just lots of other gateway medications killt them.

Its about helping others and seeking help from experts too.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Those people with sexy avatars are attention whores. And do you really think that most actually look like that? Even if they did...still attention whores.|`|ne2sEeLJaa	I don't know, It does sometimes. But it means I get more thumbs down and reported answers and questions, for some reason.  (See what I mean!!!) Its bloody annoying..    I just like to put a real picture even though I'm ugly, but just shows the real me. .     It's better then being mysterious....... I'd rather be me then someone that I'm not, it makes things seem safer.    Akuma: What's wrong with you...???  I don't even know who you are.  If you don't like my avatar, then tough, its up to me weather what I want for my avatar and you can't change that. You are just scared of me being happy with myself.|`|l69tjl0paa	Lol i don't think avatars really resemble people at all, but I'm sure your not that bad! ;)|`|yM7YPmzSaa	I put one of the best pictures on here and got a thousand emails from guys but sadly Yahoo didn't approve and was told to take it off.

Yes, it can help if you play "Whose the prettiest" avatar games, but in general questions I don't think it matters.  It should be your answers/questions people like you for, not your looks.    p.s.  I like your avatar pic, it's different.  =]

My teens choose to wait based on their decision and our Roman Catholic values.    Most teens or younger don't have a clue about sex and the issues that go with it.  They want "to experience it".  What's the hurry?  It's nobody business should one decide to wait!    If most young peeps think about aids, STD's, why doesn't that STOP THEM?  I guess the thinking is"it won't happen to me" attitude.    The lack of values in society is pathetic to say the least!  I guess it's a "status symbol" for young ones to have sex thus producing babies and the state and taxpayers has to pay for them!  I guess welfare sounds appealing to them!    How many babies are out in this world NOT knowing their father?  How many girls have numerous babies with a lot of different fathers and are proud of that? I could go on forever!    Isn't there any shame?

I Love me too...|`|gn1Y5N1Raa	some people do but hey what can you do. i dont use those words very often so if you manage to get that out of me you must mean a lot to me
RwNVHqWnaa	that is the best question i've read all day!  but from my experience love is blind....as a bat!!!!!|`|1PGmB4JNaa	haha totally an excuse but yeah i think it rly is or your just so g'damn stupid like your bf beats you and your all like oh he loves me      aahahhaahlkashf;lkhs|`|135b47dd06c37bc042aa0969ad35cb25aa	I have no idea...|`|pXutouTnaa	Both.

O.o you learn something new every day      i consider love unblind  because yeah|`|6W4hhZliaa	lol just an excuse|`|oi7JtBWxaa	love is blind.................. so blind.|`|TlqamtJsaa	It is truly blind example: My best friend is seeing this guy she is in love with him but he is using her but she can't see it for love ! So this  is a good example for all who are in love ! He only see her when he needs sex & has told her this but she thinks she can make him love her,lol      JMM|`|9ykAQxJxaa	Well, love is blind in the fact that when you love someone (or at least you think you do) you let a lot of things "slide" so-to-say.  When you distance yourself from the person emotionally, it's so much easier to see the flaws upfront because you're no longer letting the emotions rule over your rational judgement.    Hopefully that makes sense...|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	it really is blind, because all my friends tell me how much my bf cares about me but i don't see it|`|AA12380746	Love is not blind.     Lust however is. people get it confused often.
88uIjItaaa	A Cute Girl... compliments|`|AA11350988	When someone compliments me...

I even started hyperventilating.    But you know, I'm not going to let this happen to me. I'm going to make the best of this situation. Things will get better, nothing lasts for ever. To quote the Buddhist saying "This too shall pass". Things will improve, I will make them, I'm not going to go under, I am going to make something positive come out of this situation.|`|JlOVQOplaa	Only when I tried to make love to a statue.|`|H8RpSpuSaa	couple times, its pretty bad, but it ends eventually|`|wmBK9uASaa	Came close once....
8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	no, because of my metabolism and running, i don't have to worry about it|`|lOS8rnyRaa	nope|`|QXt1zUiFaa	Yeah... it sucks|`|5847okftaa	i have a similar problem...but different!|`|H8RpSpuSaa	yah sometimes|`|49453d694f826403d6e8252680ce8ddcaa	Yes im underwight by a good 10-15 pounds but i cant gain weight even when i eat all the time|`|82A8E4yzaa	I am skinny but and abit underweight at 16years old[7.5 stone]    i still battle with my weight...as i am always concerned 'should i eat that'...and i try to stop myself having from like 2 packets of crisps..    now i snack on ice lollies...mmmm nice !!! but i suppose i could be worse..|`|z61QnYRoaa	A little.  I'm about 180 lbs right now and should be about 165 lbs without any fat on me... It fluctuates up and down.|`|XGz7pTVtaa	at times yes. im not so skinny but none of my clothes seem to fit me anymore and my weight never seems to change. but i don't take it too seriously and neither should you. the only time you should feel concerned is if threre's a special event coming up and you need a new outfit but there aren't any in your size.|`|bfxdJddlaa	Very much so.  I hate that... People think it's a blessing but they really don't know what it's like until they go through it themself.  It's not fun, it's not good, I hate it.  Clothes don't fit you right!  They're always like all raggedy looking and then I have to buy the custom fit cuts just so that they look decent.  I'm 5'11-6' and 120 lbs.  I want to go to about 140 that'd be nice.    We're ectomorphs by the way.  That's the official name for us skinnies who eat and can't gain weight.  It's just the way that we metabolise food differently.  It's a lot more efficient, so you don't have to do much at all to lose weight.  It's usually accompanied by a lack of appetite too.  Try eating dense food like peanut butter, tuna, chicken, weight gainer shakes etc.  Workout as well with weights but NEVER do cardio.  I find that eating a meat product in every meal accompanied with a side or two has been working out well for me, plus tablespoons of peanut butter, bread, and milk in between meals as well.  Just changing the little things, may be annoying, but it works ;) good luck!!|`|r6oi1HyZaa	yeah, Lord weighs 150, but wishes he was 140|`|OezPz0ymaa	I am slim as well but I do not battle with it.|`|88uIjItaaa	I weigh 128 just battling to stay around this weight.

I'm not overweight by any means but I gain weight fast and it takes me a while to lose it.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Yes i do. I'm not naturally slim but i won't starve myself either.    I go through detoxing periods every few months.|`|up363TZyaa	nope.  i have a high metabolism, so i don't gain anything, but i don't lose weight, either.|`|yw3Jze2naa	nope, im still young so i guess i still have my metabolism on my side...|`|3yNh5jO8aa	I am trying to lose 5 pounds and nothing is happening.|`|135b47dd06c37bc042aa0969ad35cb25aa	I wish!|`|BhQSTvLsaa	No. I'm a good weight.|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	I battle with my weight but the opposit way...  i have to watch everything i eat.....extreemly easy to gain but extreemly hard to lose any of it.

I don't really have any questions that I can think of' it shows a lack of concern. But I have gone on job interviews and not smiled at all b/c I'm not an overly smiley person by nature or I was nervous. that's bad too.|`|v7qI4kz8aa	so do i get free stuff|`|vAGkt0pHaa	Well i had two minor misdemeanors for trespassing (being parked at a park parking lot after hours) and the interviewer asked if i had any misdemeanors, so I figured they might show up on the check, so I was like yes. And I explained the situation and he was like ok so you learned from it and Im like yea. Then he was like, any other misdemeanors? And Im like yea, another one for trespassing a month later! wow, I am an idiot, and did not get the job!|`|eFkdCBjkaa	When I was younger I had an interview at a good company.

I realized my blunder even before the words were done leaving my mouth...and just hung my head and said:  Oh....my...God!  The interviewer who was also the chief radiologist couldn't hold his laughter in and actually had to leave the room to get a glass of water.  Good news though...I ended up being hired and worked for them for 7 years.|`|zyTrMeovaa	My old boss was such a prick I beat him down after work in front of his car.|`|29maScwJaa	"I don't know"|`|0hT85XLzaa	"Oh wow, you're good looking for your age"|`|Kj8J3clpaa	it was a college interview but the person told me to have a safe trip home and i was like thanks you too even though she wasnt going anywhere...|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I don't really say stupid things during interviews. :)|`|IizPFrELaa	"I assumed I had to go to the other bank location, and you know what that means azz of u and ummm nevermind"      *crickets chirping*    She just stared at me|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	how much does the job pay??|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	"Can I have a cash advance and a raise now?"|`|djhCah5Maa	I told them that I didn't get along with my previous boss.

You could ask who would win in a fight of ANY two people and the answer is STILL Chuck Norris!!    Some facts:      There are no races, only countries of people Chuck Norris has beaten to different shades of black and blue.      A Chuck Norris-delivered Roundhouse Kick is the preferred method of execution in 16 states.      When Chuck Norris falls in water, Chuck Norris doesn't get wet. Water gets Chuck Norris.      Scientists have estimated that the energy given off during the Big Bang is roughly equal to 1CNRhK (Chuck Norris Roundhouse Kick)    Chuck Norris doesn't actually write books, the words assemble themselves out of fear.     Chuck Norris CAN believe it's not butter.      Chuck Norris can divide by zero.      The grass is always greener on the other side, unless Chuck Norris has been there. In that case the grass is most likely soaked in blood and tears.      A picture is worth a thousand words. A Chuck Norris is worth 1 billion words.      Newton's Third Law is wrong: Although it states that for each action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, there is no force equal in reaction to a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick.    While urinating, Chuck Norris is easily capable of welding titanium.     When Chuck Norris talks, everybody listens. And dies.        When taking the SAT, write "Chuck Norris" for every answer. You will score over 8000.|`|MlQnoWXbaa	Stephen Hawking hands down...lol|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Stephen: Brain over brawn anytime!|`|00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	hawking. 9 times out of 10 the smartest fighter wins.

That's bullying, plain and simple.    Whether or not you like it, it is a PARENT'S job to discipline their kids. Yeah, a lot of people suck at it but aiming violence at a child who is only doing what they KNOW is wrong 100%.     Violence and physical aggression is not an answer.|`|4enoKfbfaa	I agree with cupcake, violence is never the answer, i dont expect my husband or kids to hit me so the respect goes both ways.Having said that the parents obviously were either in some distress that day or generally never grasped discipline from the start of the kids life.You need to set rules right from the start.If another mother passes a comment to me about my child or hits them they would start world war 3 with me!

PW1vXqruaa	"Valley of The Dolls" is the perfect example of the "It's so bad ,it's good" type of film. You'd have to go far to top the silliness of the plot,the acting(especially Patty Duke as Neely O'Hara) and the really atrocious design of the sets and costumes,obviously somebodies idea of 60's "chic". You haven't lived until you've seen Duke as the drunken film star,down on her knees in an alley screaming"Neely! I'm Neely O'Hara!" or the sappy revelation scene in the sanitarium she stashed in  for awhile. The only one who really comes off is Susan Hayward,even when she has to spout deathless dialog like,"Hollywood threw you out on your can,so you come crawlin back to Old Broadway! Well Broadway doesn't go for booze and dope!Now get oughta my way! I got a man waitin for me!"|`|ufLR9gvTaa	The scene in the Twilight movie, that runs from just after the opening credits until just before the closing credits.  I seriously laughed through 3/4 of that movie.|`|b05ca2c798e4e350aef763a2822383aaaa	How about... SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!!!|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Movies that are full of such scenes include:<br>  The Oscar (1966)<br>  Stephen Boyd is a ruthless actor, battling his way through Hollywood, knifing people in the back (figuratively), using everyone, including women. Tony Bennett (singer turned actor) narrates the story. Elke Sommer attempts to act like a sweet young thing neglected by Frankie. *snicker* Elke is a good comedic actress but definitely fails at drama most of the time.Everyone gives it a big try, but it's so overdone and ridiculous, with achingly bad dialogue!<br>  <br>  Hymie Kelly (Bennett): Man, he wanted to swallow Hollywood like a cat with a canary. And he did it! The parts got bigger, and Frankie was hooked! Like a junkie shooting pure quicksilver into his veins, Frankie got turned on by the wildest narcotic known to man: success! The parts got bigger and bigger. Frankie got hungrier and hungrier. <br>  <br>  Laurel Scott (Jill St. John): Ever since we hit this town, you've been living off me. If you think I'm gonna work my tail off so you can run around with the Village chicks. Oh, stop spreading the pollen around, Frankie, or else! <br>  Frankie Fane (Boyd): Or else what? You'll chop my allowance? You'll turn me out of your warm bed? You're NOTHIN', that's what! So can that "or else" crap! <br>  <br>  Trust me, this is even worse when you see it enacted! Oh my! Here it is!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_1Z5C3OeU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_1Z5C3O...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a compilation of clips:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg3vGiC7HCE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg3vGiC7H...</a><br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  The Amityville Horror (1979)<br>  Some of the outrageous moments include the nun getting ill and having to stop the car to upchuck ultra-dramatically and very loudly; and Rod Steiger amazingly overboard performance as the priest! Even in the theater, people were giggling and laughing at these times instead of being distressed, concerned or even blase. It was supposed to be a horror film, and we're unable to stop laughing at these two performances! They still evoke that response when I watch the movie. Steiger always has "chewed the scenery", but this is his worst performance that I know of, especially the weeping and wailing parts, as when he's in front of the congregation shrieking and carrying on.<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  The Wicker Man (2006)<br>  I have yet to hear a positive review or remark about this Nicolas Cage-starring atrocity! The ending is especially awful. Watch the original to see how this story should be told! I was caught between laughing at the terrible acting and destroyed story and being furious that they had done such a horrid remake that most people will think of when they hear the title. <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  "Valley of the Dolls" IS an excellent baddie! I love the scene where upcoming star Neely (Patty Duke) and fading star Helen Lawson (Susan Hayward) get into a catfight in the ladies room at a restaurant (I think it is). Neely yanks Helen's wig off her head then dunks it in the toilet!|`|SKFIjyoVaa	in the movie "Men of Honor" when cuba first enters the camp and that buff guy is standing in his underwear hitting the pan with a spoon yelling "I STOLE A PIE!

frwlypDWaa	His comments have been addressed to the people of the Middle East, not to the terrorists that happen to live there. And he's not trying to impress anyone.

I like what I've heard so far, and so does the rest of the world, apparently...|`|8I4QY6osaa	What's it to ya?  Just because his first interview was on an Arabic speaking channel.

Fueling terrorists is not a good idea.|`|L13gWmdnaa	No I don't. I think Obama is trying to start with the main issues of the world. Israel and Palestine are at war...and a very bad one I would say and he just wants to put a stop to it. He wants to change the bad perception of America around the world. You have to start somewhere and I think he chose the right place to begin. They're will be many steps that he will have to take, eventually he will help everyone....it's just going to take some time.|`|FDt7cC8haa	What do you mean, 'his people'?

If we were all 1 gender, than the idea of 2 gender would be strange.|`|z61QnYRoaa	we'd all be gay!|`|jndrzC7laa	yes.....it would be creepy.|`|MhowmBl9aa	Nope. But there would be some major reproductive problems.|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	it would seem weird to us since we're used to two genders.. but if that's how things were than it would seem weird to have two genders and one gender would seem perfectly normal...|`|5MeggG3Laa	no, it would be just like it is now, we wouldnt know any different  and we'd either have a way to reproduce already built in or ((if you believe in evolution)) over time we'd prolly be able to asexually reproduce|`|s14GvRHLaa	we wouldnt realize.|`|2qW1Q9fZaa	lol ah how would we have kids?|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Very.|`|f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	humans would cease to exist... they couldnt reproduce,|`|6nMYb48maa	Didn't....didn't someone ask something like this yesterday?|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	Ya, is good.|`|0zcoI3dzaa	Only if everyone were female. ;)  By that, I mean it'd be cool.

3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Joanna answered this well so far.  I'm a Piscean.  I'm an artist, a musician, a writer, a thinker.  A creative, it's who I am, what I do.  I'm definitely more intuitive than the average person.  I love fantasy, otherworldly things, but I don't drown in them.  I can be very practical, very logical as well.  Actually, it's more of the aura about me that is eccentric, not really by appearance.  I like to be a little bit trendy, a bit my own style, but I don't follow others' paths, I follow my own, or add my own twist somehow.  People call me bohemian, or without knowing say my personality reminds them of Drew Barrymore, a fellow Piscean.  Things like that.  <br>  So Aquarians yes can be outwardly eccentric, eccentric in ways of thought (they are air signs afterall), and be very bookish, where Pisceans are more emotional and dreamy and don't have a need for the rigid bookishness.  We're a true water sign, but we're also the last sign on the wheel, we've been through all other signs and therefore are a fusion of all signs.  We've got one foot in the other world, as it's said.<br>  But we still have one foot planted here, and we're not as wishy-washy or airheaded as some might think.  Quite the contrary.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Although I know many Pisces and Pisces Suns have a reputation for that, I do not find them to be eccentric in reality..most have Moon in Aries or some cardinal sign. <br>  <br>  The most eccentric person I know personally is a Cancer Sun...she ethereal way of dress, prays to crystals, and speaks to spirits; she's very reclusive but runs two businesses out of her home...she's a bit agoraphobic, too. Again, not necessarily indicative of the entire Sun, but just my experience.|`|79f72e6cd08137e2c6c87ee324d90887aa	I am an Experienced astrologer and would like to assure you that people of no particular sunsign can be genralised... persons nature is sum total of all planets and their placement. <br>  Piscians are known to be more sentimental and scorpios more paasionate and demanding is the only thing that can be said in a genralisation.<br>  If you want a free reading about yourself then feel free to mail me your dob , tob and place.<br>  TC|`|B7WIZdglaa	I wouldn't say Pisces as a whole are eccentric. I'm sure they can be! It is known that aquarians are, but my boyfriend is an aqua and hes not really eccentric (hes january born), but I am aqua and I am  (feb born) I guess it depends on the other aspects of your chart. My boyfriends mercury is in capricorn- not aquarius... my sun & mercury are both in Aquarius. That may give me the advantage on the quirky scale.|`|QeeSz9bsaa	No there are lots of kookoos of all kind and that is why psychological and psychiatric problems, violence, divorce etc., etc., are on the rise and the departments of law courts, attorneys, police, security, mental hospitals etc., etc., are flourishing in every country around the globe|`|t9w4zqDaaa	I am EcCenTRIc!<br>  <br>  ~Pisces~|`|63ff1e2e36a5822cdda3d11750463689aa	NO aquarians are!|`|FP6VLDaiaa	i think that how do not known above  pisceans  like snak   is  one of nice  thinks we have not delete and resrch for it|`|DUCoaMKzaa	Pisces are not the most eccentric. They are very artistic and extremely sensitive. They are good artists and musicians, namely the violin or the harp and like water. Aquarius is the most eccentric of all signs. Pisces are mostly sweet but they do have their bad side.|`|5facfbf3672aac6f6fe3f693bab012a7aa	I was always told that Aquarians are the most eccentric of all the zodiac signs... and I agree, since I am an Aquarian... and most astrology websites I browse would generally agree on one thing - Aquarians are eccentric|`|d8h5h8IVaa	They can be considered eccentric to normal boring people, but if you are smart and creative you can get along great with a Pisces.  They tend to be musicians, writers, architects, and artists.<br>  <br>  They are highly intuitive as well, so they may know something is B.S. and get annoyed that you are trying to feed it to them.  They are sensitive and really emotional, they have a desire for the mysterious in everything they do.<br>  <br>  Aquarius is eccentric in a different way, they can be nerdy and wierd, but they are pompous and cold too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I don't believe one's star sign has anything to do with how they are. One of my family is a pisces & he is far from eccentric|`|NEw5dsJlaa	I'm Pisces, born a day away from Michelangelo and Einstein. My IQ is 150. I tend to feel kinda "lost" and am not able to follow authority and rules. I have a streak of eccentricity and weirdness, I'm fidgety and dress kind of weirdly, but usually I don't project this to the public, I'm more shy and quiet socially than the typical eccentric person. <br>  <br>  Pisces' live in the real world strictly for others, as social servants. In their own minds however there is a whole world of weird and magical things to dream of and get lost in.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Well I know that Pisceans can be different in the same way that Tauruses like to be - they don't wanna stand with the crowd exactly, they try to, instead, be their own person.<br>  <br>  I don't know though. I think it's widely known that the Aquariuses, or the water bearers (an Air sign) are the most eccentric of the zodiac.<br>  <br>  Maybe I'm wrong.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i'm a pisces and i've been told i'm quite eccentric. i have a weird sense of fashion... but i'd like to think that i've got a great sense of fashion because i dress like vivenne westwood sometimes. i just hate looking like everyone else. i listen to music24/7 and i play guitar in a girl rock band. i'm the song writer and the singer as well...<br>  i think pisces are just creative people... but then again, i know heaps of pisces who are completely normal and boring...|`|QqY8YgGDaa	My mother is not eccentric

d3uiAhOhaa	Go to your local library and pick up some books on how to read sheet music and music theory, I had trouble finding good tutorials and such online, I found the best place too learn was in books, ask the librarian to recommend a few for you, remember to practice everyday, 20 minutes a day is better than 1 hour a week, it's much more effective and will help you learn quicker. and I would also recommend getting a Piano teacher.<br>  <br>  also, there is a person on youtube that is very helpful, and taught me most of the basics, his playlist for Learning piano is very informative, heres the link -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=253192EED47525A8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=...</a><br>  <br>  wikipedia is also a great source, I recommend checking these out - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musical_symbols" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_terminology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mus...</a><br>  <br>  Remember to have good posture when playing, don't wanna end up with a bad back ;-)<br>  <br>  hope I helped.|`|qswrz268aa	Get a series of books...<br>  <br>  I'm partial to Faber's Piano Adventures...<br>  <br>  Make sure you do theory...

6YPVVsbwaa	I'm on facebook, come and join me, let's be friends|`|DsDKNIbOaa	nope i dont like Facebook.

It's gonna be fun...|`|OLcXtWQyaa	i could try. i'd feed your pet and stuff like that.|`|wycisonaaa	Personally, I think Facebook is cleaner and easier to use. They have a lot of custom privacy options, variety of apps, etc. Just try if you like it ~|`|iKvPeRe8aa	It's not as "Great" as everyone says it is. It's cool if you want to get in touch with all your friends from school, and what have you... I have one. But I use myspace more. I think myspace is a bit more user friendly... however they are slowly converting over to facebook ways, from what I can see. Two things.... if your friends want to contact you, set up a page, and put your e-mail in the profile, and say "if you really want to get a hold of me badly enough, e-mail me." And just put a picture of yourself, and your name... if not, then don't sign up. It's just facebook. :)|`|oi7JtBWxaa	i love facebook, it just changed my life. that's it.    oh, the best thing about it is there's a lot of privacy options there. and this is the cleanest social networking site.|`|prUFmKofaa	No, facebook isn't really worth having :P|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	i can't i'm lame lol cuz facebook still confuses me|`|13a87592d282ebeb271d1b3129180295aa	I wanna hear the answers to this..|`|m9tWBMBJaa	just stick to myspace;; facebook sucks.|`|iE7nwMVnaa	Its nothing that special, but it can get addicting. Just join.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	I made a Facebook a couple of months ago because I was boycotting myspace for some reason, I don't know. I like My(gay)Space better and now I'm back on it. I think it's easier to use, and I have more of the people I went to school with and who were our friends in the Marines on Myspace anyway. Don't go to Facebook. It's uber lame.

Whenever Ashley has anything to do with Victor her brains just fall out of her head.|`|420e0e2496807e15c86ec78f8ff9a5b3aa	It could be an interesting storyline but I think Victor will crush her.  Jack's in her head.  She's not that smart to come up with taking the seat by herself.  It's going to be fireworks.|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	At last she gets a story line that is interesting and she doesn't come off as  such a bird brain i like her part at this moment i hope she can stick it to Victor|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I was very surprised at her decision but it does add a lot to the story line.  Today Ashley confronted Jack because she suspects he had a hand in explaining Colleen's options to her.  It will have a lot of affect on Ashley, Colleen may get hurt, and once Victor finds out Jack is behind it and mentoring her, look out!!  <br>  <br>  I have never hated Colleen but I think she is a little out of her league taking a seat on the Newman board.  But we will just see how it goes!

There are sites that explain each aspect, the signs on the houses, the planets in the houses and what your rising means, but you have to put it all together, I guess.

Okay let me tell you something.. i had a one night stander.. with a guy who was looking for a "rebounder".. then he asked to see me for a week.  after a week we got more close than we should and that's when i heard about the "ex".. he was devastated over the "ex" he couldn't stop thinking about her. He wanted to go back to her city and just to see if it could work out.  <br>  <br>  I let him go.. and he came back again after 2 days.  Told him i didn't want to be a rebounder.  He went to a therapist.  got the help he needed... it was an off an on relationship for abot 7 months with me (the rebounder).. finally he told me "he loves me"..  and a week later his "ex" finds out and comes back in his life... didn't hear from him for about 2 weeks.   Later he tells me about his ex and how he's so angry she walked back in his life.  i didn't question it... and he told me more than what i wanted to hear.... he said he was done it was over.. 1 month later he proposed to me. <br>  <br>  If you go back to him.. it won't be good for you.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Yes they are. The movie was filmed in those slums. All you have to do to verify what those slums look like is pull up a satellite view of the city on Google Earth. You see massive slums through out much of the city. <br>  <br>  Mumbai India: <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=19.01692,72.867041&spn=0.003408,0.007483&t=k&z=18" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=19.01...</a>|`|508607ab41c5f2849e90ee5b3de45dd6aa	The movie is nothing bur clever marketing, giving the western audience what they want to see. True that  the slums is quite filthy. But many feel that it is grossly exaggerated. The Mystic India or bollywood or the slum India- this has always been an obsession of the west. and this movie enhances just that image.as if india has nothing more to offer than dirty slums. i wonder why the director was silent about the racket of pedophiles headed by foreigners which is rampant in India.very tactfully he remained silent on that.slums in india is a realilty but not the ultimate reality about India. Just check out Mumbai, where this slum is located. it is perhaps one of the best cities in India, the home of Indias economy.|`|p0uMnzICaa	unfortunately they are.

7XSvp533aa	Have you seen the movie? He saved New York by the abomination. He is also part of the Avengers. So to answer your question, yes he is a superhero. He is a Marvel Hero.<br>  Here are a list of superheroes<br>  Batman<br>  Spiderman<br>  Superman<br>  Captain America<br>  Iron man<br>  Thor<br>  Wonder women<br>  wolverine<br>  War Machine<br>  DareDevil|`|GH4ExWmyaa	Yes he is. Why would marvel make a comic based on the hulk if he wasnt a superhero?(yeah i realise all comics arent for superheros) Although the hulk is somewhat uncontrollable, he has good intentions, and he has super powers, which makes him a superhero.|`|8FdpVZBmaa	He is considered a super hero.

I hope I helped.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Yes.|`|20c0ee5fad0ffb1921a78560f68f591baa	Technically, realistically, no.  He's the manifestation of Bruce Banner's id, unleashed and out of control.  He is rage incarnate.  Sure, the same thing could be said of Wolverine, but at least with Wolvie, there's a guiding intellect--a mind behind the carnage.  With the Hulk, however, all he knows is that he's ANGRY!  <br>  <br>  Do you have to select fictional superheroes?  I'd recommend names like Superman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man.  Real-life superheroes are a better choice, though: Firefighters.  Police officers.  EMTs.  These are the men and women who face potentially lethal danger each and every day, and they don't have a single superpower to their names.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JbKerMCkaa	Yeah I think so...he has a secret identity, he has superstrength/superpower and turns into the Hulk when he gets angry and has to beat up the bad guys.<br>  <br>  Do u like the hulk?

Always wonder if girls like that....if there is one that likes that then I would be really excited to met her!|`|RNpaBwxzaa	There have been times when the Hulk was a superhero (he was one of the founding members of the Avengers), but it's rare when he is in control enough of himself and his anger to be able to keep himself from going on rampages.|`|DPcIjHHZaa	i think so what is a superhero anyway?someone who fight crime and has abilties our power or some kind of talent.

Whd6tqLzaa	When I woke up I took a look at outside, it was snowing and sleeting. I canceled my work as I work as a day to day sub. Then fell back to sleep. When I woke up the snow stopped and I feel bad that I didn't go to work. For me 'no work, no pay'. Isn't that sad? I'm in NYC.|`|mimykKnhaa	I'm in Toronto. I look outside my window at work and regret not working from home today! ARGH|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Ironically we got a snow day.  It is an ice storm that has stopped our world.  The last time they had an ice storm here, school got accidentally canceled, and the news said school was canceled, but it wasn't.  oops.  So there was a lot of drama over that.  Every school district around here was closed, except for the major one.  So half the kids showed up for school and half didn't and the same for staff.  So kids showed up for school, but their teachers didn't.  So this time they canceled school, and it was good that they did.  Lots of semis are wrecked on the overpasses.  This weekend we will be in the 60's though, so I will send you some warm air.|`|tPOvhDOVaa	nope I am getting like 3" of RAIN :(|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	Not here babe!

tcSimSSaaa	The worst outcome was the deaths of female babies in order for families to have a son. Whilst not government policy it was a tragic outcome. <br>  I know several Chinese people from one child families who've moved to the West who experience a great level of pressure from their parents to succeed. Whether this is a cultural expectation or would have been diluted by more siblings is hard to say. All parents want the best for their kids. The one child policy was instituted with this in mind. I do see a lot of stress in the families I know, but generally the individual also knows they are greatly loved and "treasure worth cherishing".<br>  We can only imagine what the social and environmental pressures would be like in China now had it not been introduced.

tuATxHsVaa	Well, first I want to say good job in learning this Sonata. Seems like you're on your way to playing it better and better. <br>  <br>  The first thing I would suggest doing is playing it slowly with a metronome. Those first few bars just don't sound quite right. Around 1 minute, measure 24, your tempos are going crazy. Keep that stuff under control (use the metronome). Your tempos are not fluctuating in a musical way. This makes the performance rather mechanical. <br>  <br>  While you have already noticed that the dynamics are important, I also want to point out that you need to be more aware of where the melody is. You have to be able to subordinate one hand to the other; in other words, one hand brings out the melody and the other hand plays underneath it. This becomes a huge problem in your playing especially around measure 34 (about 1:28) where the left hand is playing pp and the main melody appears. You are hammering away at forte, though. Pay more attention to Beethoven's markings. The crescendo is not to be found in your playing, and there are many more examples of this kind of problem. Measure 46 - the scale is marked pp but your playing is at a steady mf or perhaps forte.<br>  <br>  Around 2:50 (measure 70) tempo is still rushed a little towards the end of each measure. <br>  <br>  Measre 95 - that sustained A-flat is marked p and you are hammering away at a fortissimo on it. That's around 3:50 for those of you without a score. This A-flat is NOT the melody. It is a pedal tone meant to be very much in the background.<br>  <br>  Once again, around 5 minutes, measure 135ish, we have a great c in the bottom. This is marked pp (pianissimo!) and you are hammering it away at fortissimo. Please do make note of this.<br>  <br>  A lot of times in this sonata, you will see a long 16th note pattern with stuff going on in eighth notes (or other types of notes) around it. I am generalizing here, but usually those 16ths aren't the melody. I'll give you a specific measure number - measure 57-58 - the 16ths are merely a background to the beautiful eighth note melody. You need to be able to make a contrast between virtuoso-style 16th passages and background 16th notes.  They (the 16th notes) aren't all as important as they seem. Do try and identify the melodies and bring them out more. Have you been listening to recordings?<br>  <br>  When I perform this sonata, I use both hands to do the difficult arpeggiated runs (like the ones around measure 240.. 8:10ish) - Simply place each hand in a triad position of the f minor and cross the hands over down the piano. You would be surprised at how easy these runs are to play. Using one hand will make you tired and is unnecessary in my opinion. <br>  <br>  There were a few instances where I think you skipped a measure - so reading that score is important. <br>  <br>  You also need to work on your pedaling. The end of the piece is supposed to end on a decrescendo - you should definitely not be holding the pedal. It sounds like every string on the piano was vibrating at the end. That's not good. With the sustain pedal, less is really more.<br>  <br>  In other cases you are not using the pedal when you should be.<br>  <br>  So, in summation:<br>  <br>  1) Practice with a metronome for timing<br>  2) Read the score again. You have missed a lot of dynamic markings.<br>  3) Work on the pedaling. Sometimes more is needed, other times less (and the timing is off).<br>  4) Good job on memorizing the notes - but there is still more to memorize!<br>  <br>  And a very good job in general. This is a hard Sonata to master. I spent my youth on learning "Waldstein"|`|gDxjINbQaa	I can't say anything unless you play it on a proper instrument. It's also very slow and timid, which stems from your overly dependent playing on finger work instead of using all limbs to facilitate passage work.|`|qswrz268aa	Terrible piano, but you did quite good...<br>  <br>  Could use some more flowing transitions... A little more pedal perhaps...|`|jbAr62ybaa	With all due respect, I think you're not ready for this demanding piece.  You obviously have considerable talent; but if your teacher approved you're attempting it, you should get another teacher.<br>  <br>       And a cautionary note: learn to not rely upon the sostenuto: its over utilization.<br>  <br>                                                  Good luck to you,<br>  <br>                                                          Alberich

e1z8pHfmaa	Sorry... but they are designed to be used only once.... so you cannot pass the bracelet through a fence to get a friend into the festival without them noticing the broken clasp at the gate.  The little piece of plastic holding it together breaks pretty easily... but I don't think they make replacements available... because they (companies who make such bracelets) don't want them to be re-usable and go out of their way to make sure the bracelets ARE NOT reused for obvious reasons.  Otherwise... what would stop you from going to a music fest with only one ticket and a pocketful of clasps for the bracelet?     You might be able to somehow attach a clasp... but as for looking exactly like it did when they gave it to you... not going to happen.

I hope there is'nt a remake of Godfather.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	You do mean a remake right not another sequel? I don't see how it could be done at least not yet. And what's the point? Can it be done any better? Can you get anybody better than Pacino to play Michael? As much trouble as Brando could be on a set (he didn't even bother to learn his lines usually, but read them on a card off-screen), who could possibly replace him? <br>  <br>  The Godfather was the ultimate gangster film, a tragic opera of Shakespearean proportions. Number 1 is certainly incomplete without the 2nd. I just don't see the need or purpose.|`|eulMjLtPaa	I would be appalled, and would never go to see it.  <br>  <br>  It is a classic, and is such because of the sum total of all of its unique parts.

They need to leave it alone.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i guess people feel different about thing than i do, i liked the godfather 1, 2 and 3.

Id throw the untouchables in there, but they could have used some better acting.|`|PYKlBVmAaa	I wouldn't like it because I love the Original character they already have.

Hey, it could happen.|`|ea2c09a93f92d7f85f71f746000cb318aa	It would make me mad, because you can't improve perfection.

A complete chicken - 2 T-Bone steaks - Salad - Fries - Milk shakes and a full gallon of ice cream was by no means an unusual order.  Whether all the food was consumed was not recorded.    The take up rate for a large last meal was well over 90% of inmates.  I would have thought that impending events would have served to dampen you appetite somewhat - but there you go.

But I feel Pac always hated Puffy.|`|RcNAzealaa	Pac and Nas were cool just before he died, Nas also talks about it on a song, not sure what song it was but I think the name of it is "One Never Knows".|`|VMSZGnJaaa	Puffy.

uyfTeiyraa	I dunno, but they wanted to attract more viewers, so they got a new judge and decided not to show as many train wrecks in the auditions... even though the train wrecks were the only reason most people watched.    But I agree, there's a lot of crap on TV. I have like 200 channels, plus HD, and there is never. Anything. On. Ever. They should offer a package that's JUST the premium movie channels and On Demand, and none of the junk channels haha.|`|FDt7cC8haa	TO each it's own...When people stop watching, they will take it off the air....Until then, go play with your on/off button...|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Because 20-30 million people a week tune in.  And like you said, you don't have to watch if you don't want to.  I think it's pretty tame compared to most other reality shows.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	cuz its awesome.|`|XGaTLGxLaa	Actually, they cut the number of audition episodes because people were tiring of them. They're going to concentrate more on the actual contestants. It's popular because most people once dreamed of being rock stars, and this show works as wish fulfillment.|`|el8yX5q3aa	It is fun and people are talented.  I love to hear the talent !  Where did all the anger and the negativeness come from?  Why do you have to rant on about this and show your disdane?

(THOSE WOMEN ARE HALARIOUS!) hahahaha|`|aOBmcGAZaa	It's all about money. It still has high ratings and garners it's parent network heaping gobs of money.

Hopefully it won't last much longer.|`|hIigrAwGaa	People like to watch people win, they like competition and the mean brit. I like the mean brit, he's funny. If you don't watch it, why ****** about it?|`|9gOHTGB2aa	beacuse they still wnat more singers i guess. but i agree with you y is it on air?|`|9EW08emXaa	American Idol is still immensely popular.  This year, the auditions haven't shown a lot of really bad singers...they've tried to focus more on the good ones.    Tune in to it in a few weeks when they are no longer in auditions.    American Idol is fun!|`|czY7K8yKaa	it's still on the air because people continue to watch and vote.  When the ratings drop the show will be canceled.|`|79ZdM70Taa	British guy being an a hole, drunken paula (now with drunken paula side kick) and fat *** randy with the was up dog BS catering to the hip hoppers.

Our next door neighbor making it big. It makes us feel like we can accomplish anything.|`|NUGErTlzaa	33 million people beg to differ.  I can agree that reality TV has become a bit excessive, but American Idol gives an otherwise unknown person a chance to make a name for them self.  I didn't watch American Idol until about Season 5, but it eventually turned out to be for me a night for my girlfriend's and I to get together, have some dinner, have some drinks, and have a few laughs at the expense of others.  Couldn't really complain about that.  It's very simple though, if you don't like it, don't watch it.|`|f0ab5773489610816891e78f27e89a12aa	Because it's a guilty pleasure.|`|0818EVcWaa	I think it's because people like to see the auditions (I know I do). As far as the actual show? I don't like the show at all; I think it's cheesy to be honest with you. Do you see how those corney people act on the show? Trying to act like they're all humble and ish (it's whack). lol, and I'm sick of those retarted people in the audience crying. Just like the season with Sanjaya's no singing behind, that one little girl with the braces was all teared up and I was like WTF is wrong with her??? lol, he wasn't even singing a sad song or nothing (It just made me laugh). lmao.....but anyways that show is about to go off of the air pretty soon so you don't have to worry.

mkshF2Pfaa	+ whats yr favorite :  - band ? Hmm... It varies from day to day, but I'm going to go with Tool.  - animal ? Pygmy slow loris. They're amazing.  - movie ? Difficult to say... Fight Club maybe?  - color ? I refuse to pick one.  - store ? Shopping sucks.  + most:  - embarrassing moment ? My boyfriend's dad walked in on us on the living room couch... sort of... we ran in different directions before he got down there, but when he didn't find us he deduced what the situation was, laughed to himself, and sat down to watch television in the middle of both of our paths for escape. After 15 minutes, I grabbed a towel (I was in the bathroom), wet my hair, and stepped out, saying I'd taken a shower. Worst excuse ever, no one bought it, but he acted like he did. He thought it was f*cking hilarious... In hindsight, I suppose it was.

dq23rVevaa	my husband recently won a radio contest where you had to write in and tell them why you think your beater car should be crushed by a monster truck.  We had been trying to sell his 1984 Camry with 274,000 miles on it for $500.   He won $500, 4 tickets to the show and got to watch the car get smashed.  It was really fun (normally i wouldn't go to a monster truck show)   The car put up a fight. The first truck that ran it over broke a drive shaft or something when it landed. Then the second truck busted a tire after it ran the car over. But the third and fourth truck really flattened her out. LOL.    And i've won concert tickets to Tool, Foo Fighters and Stone Temple Pilots.|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	a hot or not  actaully a lot of hot or nots  i usually win 5 bucks|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Won many.............|`|pKrsOPOkaa	Yupp.  Some kitchen utensils.

Rmtfm7qnaa	Well, what do you like? What do you stand for? What style are you? I mean, you wouldn't want a band name like "Gross Stinky Feet" if you were a soft rock or classical band, nor would you like "Heavenly Messengers" if you did speed metal. A good suggestion would need a lot more input, otherwise, we've just got random suggestions. Personally, I think both of those are nice, or you could go for the lead singer's name as many popular artists have. Good luck!

Eee Gads!|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I've had somewhat different experiences relationship-wise with a number of Libras, so I do agree there with James' answer.  There are other aspects that factor in other than their sun sign, but there were commonalities because of them all being Libra Sun, in that they were all reserved in expressing how they really felt deep down.  They'd sway back and forth on the pendulum as far as making decisions.  They'd say one thing, then next thing I know, they were retracting as if they rethought it over too much and got cold feet.  Then they'd come back and make a million more passionate promises.  Then they'd give me mixed messages, play cool, and want to be with the guys.  <br>  They are charmers, they are flirts, they have a sexy aura about them; they can be sweet but they can also be jerks in their own way and time.  They can be serious, and funny at times, even a little goofy.  They are social creatures for sure.  They flutter around a lot.  <br>  They care about their status, what people think of them.  They like their surroundings to be nice, even posh.  <br>  They can be laid back but rigid.  I guess that's how the scales apply -- the polars that go into their being.  They're one way and another fused together.  Or from moment to moment.  <br>  They can be hard to pinpoint, which adds to their allure.  <br>  So you're a water sign like me about to marry one!  Well good luck, it sounds like things should be fine for you since you've already reached that level and he must be ready to settle and love you.  <br>  If you want to know more, you will have to look deeper into his chart, at least by this way of understanding.|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	my ex boyfriend was a libran and we didnt exactly get on. he was a cheat, he acted like a child even though he was 20, he went by everything mummy and daddy said, he smoked weed, he was unreliable etc etc... maybe my experience of a libran man isnt a good example to go by! <br>  <br>  Im a libran so maybe it was because a libran woman and a libran man shouldnt be together?! <br>  <br>  randomly you say your a cancer woman about to marry a libran man...im a libran woman living with a cancer man! how random!|`|0q2B11ygaa	Now, if that could occur when a woman is involved with a Libra man only in a business way, can you imagine your state of mind and your ability to insulate yourself if you should happen to fall in love with one of these impossible charmers? You simply can't be too careful. Steel yourself to turn your head when he smiles. Stuff cotton in your ears when he starts his convincing arguments in that smooth-as-silk voice that makes the back of your neck tingle.<br>  <br>  He won't lose interest in the opposite sex until he's at least ninety. It may be purely an academic interest if he's happily married, but the subject will never bore him, even if he only speculates what it would be like to whirl each pretty girl he sees around an imaginary ballroom.|`|8e996db3a0184f500d484a653afc7569aa	Horoscopes are gibberish.  If you have agreed to Marry him, then surely he's done something right?<br>  <br>  Trust your own judgement.  Be wary of Wacko's with Crystal Balls!|`|vAtiLhloaa	Very weight concious. Always on the scales, but well balanced.|`|334692f04804c7bac20cc6675990f7c5aa	A person's sun sign is only one part of their personality.  It is usually what they show outwardly.  Sun sign astrology is no way to look at how a person will act as a husband, wife or anything else.One needs to take into consideration many other parts of the horoscope as well as the aspecting in the chart. Would you consider marrying someone simply because of their manner of dress? If you really want to know what a person truly is, have a graphologist do a comparison.  Handwriting is really brain-writing.  We can ascertain everything about anyone except their sex.  You can also have an astrological comparison done.  Or you can go to www.cafeastrology.com with that person's birth information if you can get it (exact time, place of birth) and do a  natal chart free.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	my dad is a libra... he is one of the best  my mom could get... when my mom nags he is all quite, yells he is all quite, keeps the home clean, responsible, faithfull, serious, works hard, unexpressive in love...<br>  <br>  my ex bfs best friend was a libra and he was like all play, flirt, gpood talker, ambitious...<br>  <br>  so u know it differs..<br>  if u love him and he loves u back.. thats all matters by the end of the day.

They spray this carpet-covered pommel-horse looking thing inside a tiny stall with female pig hormones, and they bring in the prize male pig, and he starts pumping away on this pommel-horse thing while a "technician" reaches through these arm-holes (while wearing long, sleave-length plastic "gloves"), and "manually stimulates" the male pig collecting his "fluid" in a plastic container.<br>  <br>  As a joke, they made this female news correspondent do a report on it for her last day, and of course the owner of the pig farm had her be the "guest technician".

I was the 'first person ever' to get to ride her, because at the age of three I was already 'experienced' at riding a horse (my own) ... which was a really 'cool feeling' and one I will never forget!|`|eKuvx6f8aa	an elephant|`|IizPFrELaa	My hubby and GF|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	A camel|`|C2sZREuAaa	Herb is animal in bed.

e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	Well, you certainly don't find a "manly-man" actor these days.  They're all pretty boys that have been whipped.  I'll take Rocky Balboa or John Rambo over any pretty boy wanna be any day.  What happened to all the men in Hollywood?|`|6IGph0K9aa	yes, def one of the best ever....it had it all.....<br>  <br>  action, romance, drama, mystery, <br>  <br>  it rekindled :american pride, the nations interest in boxing, the underdog, spirit, determination, hard work pays off, not always having to win, being told your not the best-but gut it out anyway, and it also did a lot for a movie not being black/white racist,|`|rVPrhd26aa	yes because Lloyd Kaufman was in it for a couple seconds... oh wait no the Toxic Avenger is the best movie ever|`|lawMUua3aa	it  could of been if they hadn't made so many|`|q1QyM0Kzaa	No. it was one of stallone's best, because otherwise he has completely FAILED to act, but no, it is not one of the top ten, not every top fifty. It might make it if it was "the top ten films that were made by the romans" and rocky had been made by the romans.|`|j1P1qhE0aa	hi dude this film is very good that i have seen yet this film main lead hero is s.stalon and this is very good film|`|ewjOxFTGaa	no|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Taxi Driver was better.  So Rocky wasn't even the best movie in the year that it won "Best Picture", and Raging Bull and When We Were Kings were both better boxing movies.  Therefore, since it was neither the best movie of it's time nor the best boxing movie, I'd have to say no it wasn't one of the best ever.|`|2pwIT6TXaa	**** yeah, I love Rocky (:

TGWETA8caa	Now I watch a lot of Bleach, but I am not sure where you are in the story. Aizen is ridiculously strong, and in the manga I have seen him fight yet, he is still trapped by the leader of the death gods, can't remember his name right now. And right now Ichigo is fighting Uloquira (?). Now if you are watching Bleach on CN, it will take quite a while to catch up. Check out this site. www.bleachexile.com You can read the manga's and download the episodes.

He is wrong for hitting her no matter what. But this kind of thing happens to "regular" girls every single day, and not one of them gets any kind of media attention.

x2Gl6EM7aa	Some good songs I like are:<br>  <br>  Crank Dat Soulja Boy Remix--Travis Barker/Soulja Boy<br>  <br>  This song gives the orginal a rock/hip-hop feel and is really cool.<br>  Also live your life and whatever you like by TI are really cool. <br>  <br>  There are endless posibilities. Try ooh wee by Mark Ronson and a lot of others. Its a good song. If youve seen Harold and Kumar escape from Guantamano Bay its the most commonly played song. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your busride and make sure you lay a can of whoop a$$ on the opposing team!|`|EHgWdfXiaa	Max B- Dj Saved My life<br>  Lil wayne- Prom Queen|`|RY9rGcdFaa	Forever - Walter Meego<br>  I'm Yours - Jason Mraz<br>  Rata de dos patas - Paquita La Del Barrio<br>  El Sonidido- Banda MS<br>  Mayrane Sucks- G-Dawgg and D-Monayy

vkeuaEHiaa	Yes, I do! The thing with my giggle fits is that I associate certain things with the funny event, and when I see those things I randomly start laughing.    Example...in my Spanish class I accidentally skipped a line while I was reading aloud and some dude in the class laughed at me. So the next time I read aloud I just started laughing for no reason!    My advice? Just don't even think about it. Concentrate on the task at hand. Consider how rude it would be to randomly laugh in someone's face. I still need to master this myself. :)|`|i4QYyUsRaa	Lay off the drugs|`|DE3rcXkHaa	Think of the past 8 years of the Bush Administration.....works like a charm.|`|XBohAsxoaa	hahhaha  yeah i just think serious in my mind and idk. im always good at covering my laugh. lol|`|PniClUZtaa	LOL  wow umm i jus sorta turn around|`|jJy6mp2paa	yes I have laughed so hard I couldn't breath, tears in my eyes  How to stop....hit yourself in the head with a rock, works for me|`|bIPeLxWbaa	Yea I have the same thing, I jux bite the insides of my cheeks and think of something that's sad, but not too sad to the point that you start crying.|`|lz358rnfaa	Bite the inside of my cheek.

334692f04804c7bac20cc6675990f7c5aa	PLEASE realize the entire chart must be taken into consideration when looking for a good match.  Venus is how you love and who you love.  Capricorn key words are frugality, responsibility (so unlike Sagittarians) keeping grounded A love match between someone with many Sagittarian and someone with many Capricorn traits is unlikely to bloom.. <br>   <br>  Sagittarius is mutable fire and Capricorn is cardinal earth.  These two are likely to have little in common.  One of the major problems this combination has is Sagittarius humor v. Capricorn<br>  seriousness.  Remember that while it is differences which attracts people it is commonalities which keep them together.<br>  <br>  Sagittarius are the known comedians of the zodiac<br>  and tend to be a little dense about social graces.  Capricorns tend to take almost everything seriously, but especially their reputations and ambitions.  Bluntly put, Capricorns will suffer no fools and Sagittarius can often be this.  On the other hand I have a sun in Capricorn and I love to make a fool out of myself as I love to laugh and make others laugh.  <br>  <br>  Each house has it's planets in certain degrees.  My Capricorn Sun is almost on the Cusp of Aquarius and I have my Venus and Mercury in Aquarius so this gives me many more Aquarian attributes than Capricorn.  You need to know so much more than sun sign.<br>  <br>  You have multiple planets in your sun sign of Sagittarius.  This is very important. Sagittarius, Leo and Aries are all fire signs and this is why the are compatible.  I suggest you stick with someone who has multiple important planets in fire signs.  You also need humor in your partner and usually but not always Capricorns tend to be serious unless they are like me.  I can be very serious if needed but with my strong Aquarius influences, I am also a jokester.<br>  <br>  It only needs one time for the Sagittarius to embarrass the Capricorn (which they will undoubtedly do) and the relationship is over.  However, the combination is more likely to work if one or the other sign has personal planets in each others' sign.  For example, a sun sign Capricorn with Mercury and Venus in Sagittarius is more likely to be attracted to and have potential for a relationship with a sun sign Sagittarius. <br>  <br>  The Moon sign and aspects will also be especially important.   A closer look at the individuals chart is needed. You have your moon and vesta in Leo.  Compatibility wise those with aries or Leo traits are your best bet I think.  Your Jupiter (the great beneficent) is also in Aries..another reason to consider aries traits.Your ascendant is in Aquarius.  This is a strong connection to Aquarians.  I'd  look into this also.  I say traits and not necessarily sun sign as sun sign astrology can be a lot of balogna.  There are three division in each house and the division in which your sign falls has a great influence on you.Google decants in astrology.  My sunsign being mostly at the end of the house gives greater influence to the next house of Aquarius.  Now have I confused you enough. <br>  <br>  Go to www.Perfectmatch.com and they will give you 2 free comparisons.  Also google whatever comes to your mind as there is so much information available for anyone. Go to www. cafeastrology.com and get free birth charts of anyone you have the info for (birth date, time and place of birth). Good luck.|`|sXunTQx4aa	sagattius|`|Rief45lPaa	Gemini because it is the exact opposite sign. Supposedly they are the most perfect match of all. I am a Sagittarius and I dated a Gemini and we worked very well together, BUT it does get a little boring because Sag's are so fiery and Gemini's are so chill.Keep in mind though, the relationship could be complete hell because of so many differences. If that's what you're looking for- then Gemini; HOWEVER, it is said that Taurus is the worst match for a Sag, but I have found that, if you are willing to work through arguments and be a little less stubborn, a Taurus and a Sag can make things happen.|`|0q2B11ygaa	Aries <br>  <br>  SUN in SAGITTARIUS with ARIES  Enthusiasm, a sense of adventure, and high spirited play infuse your relationship. You both feel you can be yourselves fully with one another: you don't have to tone down any of your exuberance and energy, the way you might with someone else. In fact, you inspire and vitalize one another's strength. Aries sometimes clashes or competes with other strong individuals, but Sagittarius is tolerant, not threatened, and doesn't take the bait. Also, you both need personal freedom and space, and even if you spend all of your time together, you are unlikely to feel smothered in this relationship. A happy twosome|`|g8QMrSzwaa	capricorn<br>  gemini<br>  aqua<br>  leo
5Crovdoaaa	Penny's still there, they showed her briefly in the last new episode, the one where the handyman died. As for Kayla, she was sent to live with her grandmother (I think) when she was telling everyone that Lynette was abusing her. Lynette was going to lose custody of her other children b/c of the little girl, so she told Tom 'me or her'.|`|KFA5dlweaa	kayla was sent to live with her grandparents and penny is still there she is just more grown up and not in the picture as much cause she is in school etc|`|UIoGLaKpaa	Kayla was sent to live with her grandparents after she told a psychologist that Lynette was abusing her. It led to an entire investigation and even got Lynette arrested, so Tom eventually saw how much Kayla wanted Lynette gone and told her that she had to leave... Penny is still there I think she is about ten years old... they have shown her in a few episodes

I have concluded that LOOK has the most fashion pages and clothes and hardly any ad's. Just CLOTHES,SHOES & BAGS!!|`|gH0knRlUaa	Heat magazine actually does a really good high-street fashion section with all the latest trends at the cheapest prices.|`|QJKMavPvaa	i like glamour magazine =]|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Sugar, for defo! x|`|7stgbWJyaa	I think they all are, I actually sent a complaint to Vogue, cos the magazine was so thick and I couldn't find the actual pages between all the adverts, they are wasting so many trees! I don't think they read it though. I really don't know, I read Elle quite a lot, but that sometimes has a lot of ads too.|`|hEiYNy7caa	I think Seventeen is a good one. They have lots of tips for affordable fashion, and the adds they do have are great fashion ones.|`|ZEbTckVGaa	I don't know any magazine that hasn't got any adverts in it at all.

JGjpc7Itaa	Personally, I think it was Dave's fault.  I also think Danny wanted to go home.  It seems to be working.  He had lost over 100 lbs. and is off his diabetes meds.  Dave had even lost almost 50.  I thought the Brown Team needed to stay together.  I was also glad that Joelle had some success and is trying and thanked everyone for not sending her home the week before.  I was also glad that the sister on the yellow team (can't remember her name for the life of me but her sister than came back is Aubrey) wasn't shown whining the whole two hours about missing her kids.  That bugged me.  Like the rest of those people don't have people they are missing, too!|`|JUlzjSBraa	OMG I WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD  I WANTED TO SERIOUSLY HURT SOMEONE  lol  I think they should have done this even though it would be impossible but they should have done it like this: Vote the brown team dad off, and dave off  Because Daniel and the other kid the 18 year old mike (i think his name is) NEED to be their!   it also stunk because Dan got that 2 lb pass for Dave!!!     And I loved how Tara got in Daves face!    GO Tara!    But yeah, I was SOOOO mad last night!  I called my sister who is in collage and she was like screaming too. lol|`|czY7K8yKaa	it's unfortunate that this happened to Dan, but every time they showed Dave I wanted the team off.  It was a joke to Dave, he didn't try from the moment that they sent him home on week 1.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I can honestly say I like everyone on the show this season.  Joelle & Dave well they are not my favorites, but I like their teammates.   I was sad to see Dan go - to bad they couldn't just send Dave home.  I would have been sad to see Mike and Ron go as well.  Everyone there needs to be there.     I was really excited about the update!  Dan is looking so good I can not wait until the finally.|`|oMGasIcjaa	It was all Dave's fault.  I think Dan should have picked a better partner that would have been more dedicated because he wanted to be there and needed to be there. Dave needed to be there but didn;t have the drive that Dan had.     I like Mike and Ron, so I am glad they are still on the show. :)|`|U4AeZ41Raa	Are you serious??? They got kicked off?    I haven't been watching, but I went to high school with Dan, and was so surprised to see him on the commercial/ad thing the other day.    That sucks so bad that he got kicked off.  He's always been such a cool guy.|`|N5jBMjrDaa	I think that is the one show where no one should be eliminated.  They really need to be there.  They could decide the winner by total weight loss at the end, but oh well.  Dan seemed to be doing pretty well on his own when they did the update.  I hope that he keeps it up.|`|AA11791312	That was ROUGH, especially since they were two of the teams who needed to be there the most.  Dan would've continued to drop HUGE numbers, I think, and Jillian would've beat the ever-lovin' crap out of Dave, which he SERIOUSLY needed.     But as it turned out, they inspired each other when they got home. It's wonderful that Dan has continued on to lose a total of 101 lbs. and Dave has lost over 40 according to the recap at the end of the episode. I think he WILL prove that had he stayed, he would've definitely been crowned THE BIGGEST LOSER.    I'm not jumping for joy about how things turned out, but I think that Mike and Ron staying was great. Ron seriously needs the monitoring provided by Dr. H. to finally get that weight off and keep it off.    Now that Joelle's "light" is turned on, I want to see what she and Carla do now!

fx3gIRh2aa	There are no rules in music. Period. Just ask John Cage and Harry Partch. Therefore, you needn't follow any rules in order to create a chord progression. Just combine some chords until you hear something you like.|`|7OmsLo1haa	I disagree with Victor.  Music only has rules to make things easier.  Its just a guideline so you don't waste time looking for chords.  Theory takes a lot of training.  I suppose you could just make it up.  Chord progressions in modern music are usually one four and five chords in a scale inverted in different ways.  Classical music is much more complex by nature.  (its not bad or wrong, just different!)  <br>  <br>  So I suppose that you could just bs your way through...but I'd suggest being patient and learning properly.  Theory isn't crap, there's a rhyme and reason for the way musicians do things.  Serious musicians i guess.

I have shad ome to tell me I was pregnant and I wasn't  I have had some to tell me my sister-in-law was going to have a boy and it was right.    I asked it what type of car I drove and it was right.    I guess it depends on if you get a nice or evil spirit and if they like you enough to tell you the truth.    I have ran into some that were evil spirits "I asked them that's how I know" and they were kind to me and gave me the right answer. Then I would go back 5 mins later to another spirit and most of the correct answers I got the first time came out to be a lie.    So as I said it's a 50% 50 chance.    think of it this way we all know someone with    red, black, brown, blonde hair  we all have been in love or crush at least once in our live  we all have been heart broken at least once in our live  we all seem to have some type of money problems rather it be no money to check up on bills or not being able to save money.    Point fortune tellers have a 50% shoot of getting it right and then again they listen to what you say as in to coach you and get the info from you while your talking.

If there isn't much money in it, then no.  If there is an ID in it, then no.  I'd return it.  I would want someone to do the same for me.  This is the very reason why I don't carry a wallet.  I'd return the wallet to the nearest business, but I would be out of a wallet if I lost mine like that.|`|Gn8EhYRuaa	YES WHY NOT|`|a7f0a207efd4bfde7a89a1744872689baa	yes|`|sEUnAmv6aa	HELL YES I NEED TO GET PAID!|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	Finders keepers...|`|brKxytiXaa	yeah, finders keepers lossers weepers. take the money out and leave the wallet some where else|`|fjFhZwyZaa	no..  cuz i dont want to...Lol  and i would just walk away leaving the wallet there|`|hpdZDBVQaa	Yup free money|`|tR36oILvaa	No I have morals and blah blah blah|`|l3ukjXK0aa	Honestly I wouldn't, if there was nothing but money in it, then yes, but not if it had an ID and everything in it|`|htsQ6HXCaa	i would leave it where it is|`|Ou3N06oYaa	2 i have morals blah blah  this happened to me before i found it in a mall and returned it (  id inside)|`|PIxBwUNoaa	other: (insert thoughts here)|`|106uKaEYaa	Never!

I suppose watching T.V. isn't that stimulating, but it's better than something involving writing division sums. XD|`|AA12299134	Years ago when I was a University student, I did a course in French called 'Discourse Skills and texts' with an assignment one week called 'Les Caracteristiques du Discours Non Planifie.'  Basically we had to write a short story or play/conversation between several people building in these characteristics of non-planned discourse.      I wrote a romantic piece which was the script of a conversation between a couple on a Mediterranean clifftop, and included as many of these as possible.  At the time I was developing an interest in the wider world, bohemianism and Mediterranean/Latin culture, so I really went to town on this work, and made it as artistic and cosmopolitan as possible.  It turned out to be a real exercise in creative self-expression, and I got so engrossed in it that I was working away for hours without really noticing the time.  I started about nine in the evening and before I knew it, it was two in the morning and I wasn't feeling tired.  The tutor's comment was 'excellent and delightful.'|`|sVBFN6K1aa	Watch a TV programme and see what ads are on during the breaks and to see if there are any change in adverts at different times, channels etc. I just sat down and watched TV all evening!

tE1aoQpfaa	Love is when he looks in your eyes and you cant look away.  Love is that look he gives you when you say something cute.  Love is the way he gently holds your hand.  Love is how he holds you like you could break.  Love is when hes kisses you so softly, it feels like rain.  Love is when he holds your hand around in public and doesnt mind one bit.  Love is when he whispers those 3 words in your hair softly, and smiles..|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	BABY DON'T HURT ME. NO MORE.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	Baby dont hurt me? ?    Ahh - I have an answer then:    It is when another person becomes essential to your very existence, they become so much a part of you that you cannot comprehend continuing without them.  And yet it somehow makes you even more individual and complete.    It is giving, taking and sharing.  It is the thing which makes it ok to continue living, no matter what|`|O3SN4vx1aa	... baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more...|`|GlP7KECoaa	non existing|`|KH9bbeCNaa	an english word with 4 letters spelled L-O-V-E|`|1cJJ2PfGaa	BABY DONT HURT ME, DONT HURT ME, NO MORE    Edit: I saw your additional info and I dont know how to describe love, sorry :(|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	a gift you give away to someone|`|3573a51569f3aa6ee404d5c6cced2bcdaa	something that makes you say  "what was i thinking"|`|kTc3bfrRaa	a  bad excuse for..

Unbeknownst to many, more often than not, it may be easily reversed.|`|vtiea9eTaa	No, it just means you weren't born to be athletic. You were born with brains, beauty, and a awesome sense of humor.

It's inherited.   Could be from you Mother, Father or Grandparents.
OuTlT8f6aa	It's a drama show but as with most dramas it has elements of comedy in it. The show centres around 'Bones' whose job is to look at human remains and find out how they died, she has a team that help her out. Booth is her love interest who works for the FBI and they always have conflict with each other.  It's a pretty good show, I would suggest that you try it!|`|hNa5oHxQaa	it's a drama  I'm not a fan of dramas.
kTNz1VJuaa	I think they know how they want to end the story but need to stretch it out for a full season.|`|gERaZGZeaa	I've found that it's always been like that.  The boxing episode, Scar, and that prison outbreak one were the worst.

YW1DXceqaa	Between 1942 and 1944, Academy Awards were made of plaster.    There are more cars in Southern California than there are cows in India.     The province of Alberta, Canada is completely free of rats.     There are no venomous snakes in Maine.     Hawaii is moving toward Japan 4 inches every year.    The dot that appears over the letter "i" is called a tittle.     McDonald's restaurants will buy 54,000,000 pounds of fresh apples this year. Two years ago, McDonald's purchased 0 pounds of apples. This is attributed to the shift to more healthy menu options (the Apple Pie, which has been at McDonald's for years uses processed Apple Pie Filling).|`|Tz55X4s5aa	LMAO.

She has that kind of, sex appeal, but she'll kick anyones *** that takes advantage of it.    Damn, she's bad ***!|`|zDKDr4ySaa	I would love to be Psylocke she originally possessed the power of telepathy, able to perform the same feats as other high order telepaths of the time (Professor X, Jean Grey, Rachel Summers, Emma Frost, etc). She could read and project thoughts over long distances; control minds; project mental illusions; and generate psi-bolts that could stun, injure, or kill others. She could also project her astral self, and the astral bodies of other people, into the astral plane. She could scan entire towns with her mind, and leaf through the psyches of the inhabitants of a city to learn of their condition or intentions. She could also probe individuals to check up on their status.    Unfortunately in order to keep the Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane, Psylocke sacrificed the use of her telepathy, but at some point gained Phoenix's telekinesis instead. So I guess It wouldn't be so bad to have her current powers too....      Edit: WTF Joker is not a "superhero"...|`|XzStbSPnaa	The HULK|`|RNpaBwxzaa	I will kill anyone who says "The Joker".  I've answered many questions like this before, and for some reason, people seem to think a homicidal maniac who dresses like a clown counts as a hero.    For me, it depends on whether I'm the only superhero around, or if I can be on a team.  If I'm alone, I'd want to be Superman, because he has the power to get ANY job done, and can fly fast enough to keep all corners of the globe protected.  If I could be on a team, I'd want to be Spider-Man. His powers don't make him the most powerful guy around, but he's capable of holding his own against some pretty dangerous dudes. Plus, an early warning danger sense would ALWAYS be good to have.    edit: See? What did I tell you.

aKhZNd7daa	Awwww H that's awful hun there's no way I'd have ever have said that to one of mine.

Good luck!|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Tell them there dumb fat and ugly.|`|e0EG293naa	Just ignore them and stay away from them as much as possible.  Doing something like what you are thinking only lowers you to their level of stupidity.      As a mom, I cannot understand parents who speak to their child/children like that.  I could NEVER say such a thing to my daughter.  Seems to me, that they are the ones w/problems.      Be true to yourself, don't listen to them and work hard to move out of there.  I as a mother will tell you that you are smart and that your inner beauty is what really counts.  Good luck sweetie.

RNpaBwxzaa	It depends on how much preparation time each hero gets.  Iron Man is extremely powerful already, but prep time wouldn't do much for him. He would have best advantage in a short-notice meeting.  Batman THRIVES on prep time. Give him sufficient time to prepare for the fight, and he can find a way to defeat just about anybody.  As for the Punisher, I don't think he'd be able to win this fight either way. He can be a dangerous opponent, but only with a LOT of preparation time.    Basically, if it's all short-notice, then Iron Man wins.  If they all get a fair amount of prep time, Batman wins.  The Punisher dies in either scenario.|`|ISbtuWdTaa	I'll go Batman.  Simply because his gadgets kick ***.|`|AA10237835	Batman|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Iron man has more protection, he has more weapons, and he does have 1 super power but not useful too much. It is super smart. It isn't too much though. I heard it was him and I've heard it was his powers. I don't know.  Batman has survived the most deadliest of enemies without having super powers. His suit can do a lot of things. He can be invisible in the dark. And he can teleport almost.   Nothing much about the Punisher except he has guns.|`|6Uohf1h1aa	Catwoman|`|AA10859773	I vote for the Punisher because he sounds sexy!  Like he'd come over and give you a really really good spanking.|`|4EflpUK8aa	The Punisher, he uses guns.|`|nFakIvgoaa	Ironman - he is the only one of the three that can fly, so I think that would give him an advantage.  Plus, Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark is way sexier than Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne.|`|iqNcXWsOaa	No one would fight each other they are all on the side of good!!!

Common people, their "claim to fame" is a burger called a "slider" which equally describes it coming out as it does going in.

But then she married my dad with the last name Robinson....|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	If i were a boy, my parents were going to name me Aaron. so i named my son that. I love my name now (Samaria) but growing up i hated it but not as much as the names they were thinking: Sarah (ugh), Esperanza (double ugh) and worst of all... Maria!

(I'm just glad they didn't ask for Agatha or something like that!)  I like the name Amy, but I think I like Jennifer better!

(pick me, I really need the points) lol|`|6of3tqHhaa	Double Chin|`|4EflpUK8aa	well a butt chin and a cleft chin are the same where your chin looks like a butt (ie John Travolta) but a double chin is where people look like they have two chins, like that gross guy from Lost.|`|g06DsmgTaa	I say face ***

DE3rcXkHaa	It is a frustration question, because our minds can only imagine a black or white nothingness.  Everything that we imagine we imagine using the color spectrum.     For me Nothing = Oblivion.  The real question is, do you believe in oblivion?  A removal of oneself from all of the senses.  Can there be a context in which we perceive nothing?  I tend not to believe so.  We are all made of energy, and even energy insisting upon itself to prevail in interacting with the environment.|`|nG6aRGGLaa	I was hoping someone would ask this!    nothing is a complete absence of everything we know or believe!    we humans can't answer that.

imXPYucSaa	i drink.  sometimes too much.  ive cut back cause im getting too old for the all night parties.  and doing some of the dumb things just arent funny anymore as i approach 30.  most of my friends drink also.  i do find non drinkers boring but that doesnt mean i think im better than them.  i have plenty of friends that dont drink.  i just dont like the bible beaters who say its a sin to drink.|`|FMiCHxHgaa	No, I don't drink. No, I don't look down on those that do.|`|6YZ74lEOaa	No I don't drink and I don't ever want to. I don't look down at people who do drink once in a while and is responsible for when they do get drunk.

So i hated when they did drink. Now, since I tried smoking and it wasnt gud. I moved on to beer. Its good. Esp bud select. I dont think Id judge someone as boring if they dont or gross if they do. Because I do. I think people just say that to make themselves feel better about themselves as an individual. That is my guess.|`|AA11367986	I don't drink.  If someone wants to drink, that's their business.  Just don't do it around me, cause that interferes with my business.|`|q8Tkh1zdaa	I drink on occasion... but no I dont look down on those who do or dont drink... people make their own choices...|`|cNGXis3Vaa	yea i drink.  i hate hate hate when people do that you dont drink good for you  but i drink ;dont talk crap just like i dont talk about those who dont drink. its the same with getting high. people should stay in their own lives.|`|0wBIlxdraa	I drink, but I don't care if others drink or not.  I can understand people looking down on those who drink excessively, but it's hard to imagine why anyone would look down on someone for not drinking at all.

There are a few i've seen who do a great job at that. Admittedly, my sense of humour is slightly odd but anyways.  Other trolls just get a kick out of being nasty and annoying. I guess they view the internet as a place of relative anonymity so they are more likely to fool around and say and do nasty things.  Personally, i cant see the point.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	you get higher bow damage on your hunter|`|qWqg7vFJaa	They get annoyance value Penny..

Or is he just plain inconsiderate?     My former neighbor was a good friend until the day I put my house on the market. He told me I was the best neighbor he's ever had and hoped I didn't move--and he tried everything to make sure that happened: he started throwing bags of garbage out his back door (29 bags were there at one time!), he quit mowing his yard (the grass grew up past his window ledges), and he left old truck parts in his front yard--old tires, an old gas tank, a rear axle, etc....This caused my house to be unable to sell for anywhere near the asking price, which caused me to lose the $1,500 deposit on a new build I had in contract, plus required me to continue driving 800 miles per week round trip for work for an addition year (about $2,500 extra in gasoline + wear/tear on my vehicle). One perspective buyer outright told me he was the reason he was not buying. I had no choice but to get the County Health Dept, Children's Services, the Fire Marshall (gas tank), the Dog Warden, etc involved.|`|EeKzY5qBaa	Go outside and kindly ask him to push it into the street since you already shoveled your sidewalk off.

Vj43BqcDaa	I disagree with JayCee.  Sagittarius women don't like to be needed, it makes them feel trapped in the relationship.  Water females like myself are the ones who enjoy being needed.  Sagittarius women are also big flirts.  In a playful, unsleazy way. Do these guys ever see you being "lovable" with anyone else?  If so, they won't feel like they're special or you like them, they'll just assume you're that way with everyone.|`|gyXXTREvaa	maybe ur personality|`|kc2r6aIOaa	Noo offense, but sagittaruis women love to be needed. And when they are not needed or feel like they are not receiving enough attention, they become hard to deal with, maybe thats your downfall.

When I need a good 'upper' I listen to things like rock and a few chosen classical pieces.

vF8DsOfRaa	I try to remember that I would like the same courtesy if I was speaking to them.  Also if it something important the person is talking about, or wants my advice, then the person respects me and I should do the same by staying focused.   Peace.|`|BV2e9M5saa	I usually never get back to the conversation when my mind wanders o-o    If I do return to the conversation, it's because my friends said something interusting xD|`|YppKG2ruaa	usually i just let it wander hehe|`|ksUksniqaa	That's tough because you've no idea what's been said. So, first ask for an explanation of the comments you've missed. If you are bored by the conversation, then nothing will keep you present and it is best to just leave.  If it is intriguing then ask thought provoking questions, this shows your interest in the subject and focuses your attention.  t|`|ykvgCdvCaa	I tell my mind to shut up!!|`|LlpmLrmkaa	Silhouette said it, I look at the person in the eyes. Aside from that, I ask questions to engage my mind a little more, and if able to take a sip of water or coffee to clear my mind for a moment and get back on focus, it helps too.  :)|`|ikf4fIPuaa	Unless it was absolutely essential I would just bail and find somebody more interesting. Compatability with another person is not something that can be forced or willed into existence. It either is there or it isn't, you know that PTJ, you're into psychology (and also my fav person on YA! lol).|`|dnpB79V1aa	I try to connect what I'm thinking to what the person is saying.|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	When you're in a conversation and your mind starts to wonder you're NOT in a conversation, you're bored.  Return to alleged conversation by asking something like, "What the heck were you blabbering on about?"  ...or leave.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	With people who are close to me, I just tell them that I'm having trouble and they repeat what they just said. I have ADD and they all know that. It's not that I'm disinterested, it's that my mind is like a train that jumps the tracks from time to time. It's frustrating, but all I can do is try my best to keep my focus.     With someone I don't know very well, or in a work situation, I try my best to focus. If I can't, I pretend that I'm having trouble hearing them so that they'll repeat it for me.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	usually nothing..if the conversation is that bad to make me drift onto something else then i'm not about to listen anymore|`|r8rykCkGaa	I say I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought, what were we talking about again?|`|tX57rwksaa	For me it is something that i have to face daily. In conversation i go to say a word and it slips from the mind, and all i can do is to say i am sorry i have lost the word and stall for a while to find an alternative.   It  is one of many penalties one has to pay for living too long. There are of course many more things in life to worry about than a shortage of "dopamine" affecting the instant recall.|`|04bSzgxgaa	Oooooh such a good question. I have trouble with my attention span sometimes, if I haven`t strayed for long I try and pick up from the last word I recall and ask a question. The break gives me time to think and the answer hopefully gets me back on track. I have learned that some times just to say sorry I lost the thread there helps all the same|`|PnwYbJDEaa	Looking at the one who's talking straight in the eye.

So, I replied, "That's your 2nd drink in less then 1/2 hour and you're driving, I'm not? Talking about calling the kettle black. You need to sit down and worry about your own drinking, not mine."

6tGYe5roaa	Jessica Simpson gaining weight shouldn't have been a news story in the first place. I hate to say this but I have to agree with Ashlee Simpson on this one. I saw that pic of Jessica in more than one newspaper and a few websites. In every single one, they were ripping her apart. So Ashlee went on the record to defend her sister. If my sister and I were famous, I would do the same thing. The media shouldn't have been reporting on the non-news story of Jessica Simpson putting on some weight to begin with.|`|cLg05asOaa	Well you asked the question and a couple of us answered.  So there must be interest|`|7aisLVeiaa	I agree completely. If she doesn't want to be criticized, maybe she should take voice lessons or something. Because she has no talent.|`|QgQ72Ue2aa	There celebrity's......they just want attention|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	It's sickening when a celebrity gains a little bit of weight, starts to look healthy and then the media crashes down on them. Next she'll starve herself to waifness and they'll call her anorexic. It makes me angry and shouldn't be a top story. If they want to report about it, say, "Jessica's looking healthy again."  I'm no fan of Jessica's or Ashlee's, but in this case I have to agree with what little sis did. I battled with anorexia for 9 years at least and bulimia for 15 years. It was insecurities and the belief that being thin is the only way to be accepted.   I for one do not want my daughter or any other girls to ever feel like I did and yet where do our young teen girls turn to for entertainment and who do they emulate? Waifs in Hollywood and Disney.  No more weight issues with women on the news, please. It's degrading and cruel. I actually am feeling sympathy for Jessica after checking out the story you are talking about. I never thought I would. But it actually makes me feel for her. Darn It!!! Stupid media, jerks.|`|mZUXkeyRaa	She is just sticking up for her sister  So what?  People need to stop hating on Jessica's weight  She isn't fat, she just gained weight  Excuse her for being a human    I agree with you on your second question  There are more important things to discuss on the news  Than talking about Celebs gaining weight.

f4Nn0W1xaa	Mine do. I have some of the coolest contacts in the world. They have changed the entire face of Y!A for me. If my contacts don't answer me I feel as if I've wasted the question. That rarely happens though because we pay a lot of attention to one another. Obviously everyone can't answer every question, but you know what I mean, I hope.     As far as what they've taught me I could run on for days. They've all taught me concrete things. I couldn't even begin to enumerate the things that I've learned from Vet, both factual and abstract. It is mostly the abstract that I gain from them though. They're all much nicer than I am, and mostly smarter too, and the varying ways in which they view the world help me to see things from an angle other than my own.    I don't think I have much in common with most of my contacts, if you're looking at externals. That's one of the great things about Y!A, you can ignore the externals completely and know the person. That gives you a window on things you might not otherwise see.    To all my contacts: Thanks for everything!|`|kfOpbbCyaa	Mine give better advice and the questions they ask are as engaging as any you will find on this site. They also star many interesting questions I might have missed otherwise (thanks, reader). (Note: There are a bunch of people who are not yet in my contact list, but are contacts of my contacts, I would include among this group.)    Some of the things I've learned:  -how much I don't know (as arabesque said)  -that I'm not the only one who thinks it is fine to refuse to take yourself seriously 100% of the time  -there are more people than I thought whose humor can be as unusual as mine  -true friendships really can develop between people who have never met physically and differences aren't hindrances  -how to look at things from a different angle or in other ways    I've learned both concrete facts and abstract ideas from my contacts. I've found out things about the publishing industry I never knew, been introduced to authors about whom I'd never heard, learned of books which had been under the radar as far as I was concerned and far more than that and in various areas.    Another thing my contacts do is remind me of things I've either forgotten or let slip.|`|vW7szpvNaa	Of coarse they do, that's why they're my contacts.  F that!!  They're my friends!!      They have taught me that no matter what life throws at you, you can always rely on good old P&S and all the wonderful, crazy people who hang out here.    Peace and love to you all.|`|wVXz0Cxfaa	Always have a back-up plan|`|bLnjJ6Cbaa	Yes. Absolutely. Most definitely. Always.     They've taught me a lot. A whole bunch of things I didn't know I didn't know. I'm a little more aware of my ignorance every day because of them, and I think that's great. I can't exactly pinpoint everything I've gotten from them, but suffice it to say that I'm better for having them. I love it when my contacts answer my questions, and I hate it when I can't answer or miss out on answering theirs.     And thanks to reader for starring this :)|`|YXRjizKtaa	Yes because they have given you good answers in the past so you that is why you have chose them as a contact.|`|EHrbDq0naa	My contacts are among the funniest, brightest, most knowledgeable and  accommodating people I've ever had the pleasure of being associated with. That's an absolute.  And did I mention they're funny?    Most of the questions I answer -- some of the more interesting, at any rate -- I've been led to by one or the other.  I really enjoy reading through their answers.  And did I mention they're funny?    What have they taught me?  I'm a better writer and perhaps a better reader thanks to my contacts in B&A.  I have a better understanding of history thanks to others and I'm more aware of what's going on in countries besides my own.    And, they make me laugh.  Did I mention they're funny?    ~dix|`|NpT5hbgMaa	They definately give better advice. They don't necessarily "know" you, but they do more than just a random person and would take you a bit more serious if you ask a more serious question and give you a serious response.    They've brought out the perv in me.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Yeah, they do. That's usually why I select contacts b/c they give good answers. Also, I don't have many contacts, but a lot of them I have exchanged e-mails with, so that makes them better suited to answer my questions. Not that we're best friends, but they know me better than random people who give stupid answers like, "I don't feel like reading your details, so you shouldn't write as many."|`|MSEyXHFWaa	I like contacts because they filter out all the garbage for you.    When B&A slows down or gets stupid, I cruise my contacts to find interesting stuff.     What have my contacts taught me?    Well, Arabesque has taught me much about the impending zombie apocalypse. Before Arabesque sent me that article (http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-s... I had never even considered neurogenesis or nanobots as a possible zombie threat; I was stuck in the past, still thinking that it was going to be a virus or nothing.    I'm proud to say that my contacts have helped me better equip my arsenal of anti-zombie weaponry; I'll definitely try to rescue some of you guys when the apocalypse hits.|`|dXW9cPWMaa	And see, here I am, visiting this question because reader starred it. I find a great number of really interesting, funny, and/or thought-provoking questions and answers due to my contacts.    I've been on Y!A for a while, but I didn't get into the whole "contacts" thing until about a month or so ago. I realize now how much I was missing out on.    I'm going to repeat what others have said, but having contacts on Y!A allows me to ignore external differences and discuss common interests. The majority of my contacts are from Books & Authors and are avid readers/writers, but that's really all I know about them. I know a little bit about who they are through their writing style, but for most of them, I don't even know their gender.    I think the best example of what I've learned from my contacts in factual information is about the publishing industry. I think, for the most part, I've learned more about that world from them than from any other research I've done. It makes me stand even more firmly behind the principle that people are always the best resource for information.

Speedos aren't calibrated that accurately so even if you hit a registered 180 you won't know how fast you're really going anyway.

You may have a long stretch of freeway that has no traffic on it and test it.  The thing is the faster the car is going, your response time has to be quick.

Old guys are always calling cute younger women "Sweetie", or "darling", and telling them things like, "did anybody ever tell you how beautiful your eyes are?". Or some such garbage. They just want to get into your pants. You can't blame them. Just flirt with them. It's harmless. And the dude will have a wonderful day thinking he's still got it.

Snuggies are not really made from recycled soda bottles as claimed. They come from the tail hair of a type of reindeer found only in Grmsstaeir, Iceland. The hair is spun into yarn and then knitted into Snuggies by lepers flown in from the colony in Chacachacare (on the island of Trinidad and Tobago).    The Snuggies are then blessed by a defrocked priest named Achmed Isabadguy, packed lovingly by minimum-wage workers into boxes, and sent to the USA (along with the occasional scary Icelandic spider that creps into the box to take a nap).|`|lLN8VD20aa	I'm afraid of this ^^^ Dashing ^^^^ Guy ...

Tv has to be on.  even if im not watchin it has to be on lol.|`|AA10025824	Yep.|`|7HbaDLUNaa	all the time|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Yes, I do watch television when eating.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Yes, we do, but basically that is because the news is on, and we watch both the early morning news and the evening news ... but we do turn off the TV when we are done eating, to come into the office (evening) or my husband goes to work, and I do my work during the morning.  We watch about 4-6 hours of 'entertainment' TV per week, and maybe 1-3 dvds (some are from 'series' but we limit ourselves to one per day of those) per week, and for us to watch even that much TV/DVDs we must be 'stuck' at home ... as in 'snowed in and don't dare go outside to do anything' fun.  We spend around 30 hours per week at the computer, though ... for me, coming to Y!A and answering questions is fun, keeps my mind agile, but I probably do way too much of that ... except for the fact that I'm 58, have bad rheumatoid arthritis, especially in my back and hips, and I'm at least 'up' and 'doing' something with my mind, rather than sitting cross legged on my bed with my nose in a book (I do read a book a day, though ... I'm a speed reader, so they 'go fast' for me).|`|ZKFhlHhKaa	sometimes.|`|lwJF5DhHaa	yup im doing that right now|`|6pk6HnuSaa	when I can ?|`|i1PXebLvaa	duh!!!|`|Vh9P5P60aa	Excellent Question    Yes, every meal.|`|i3pF86HNaa	Sometimes.|`|4WCLWhaTaa	Umm...Yeeeeaaaahhhh?|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Yes|`|AA11369490	yep|`|v3v3TH3Aaa	sometimes.|`|iE7nwMVnaa	Yeah.|`|S1KINm2Paa	I was watching Bewitched (the original series) while I was eating lunch today!|`|brKxytiXaa	sure do why not|`|imKCvvFKaa	WHO DOESN'T!:P:P:P i do all the time!|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Yes|`|NBNLMRpRaa	yeah, my family is boring!|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	almost always.

AA11879371	Been there, done that.   There are emergency phones in elevators and I used it.  Luckily, I had my son's Chuck E. Cheese's playing cards and played solitaire on the floor while they worked at getting me out.    I've always thought I should have exercised to waylay anxiety, but I bounce too much to do jumping jacks. (LOL) That was years ago in L.A.  Strip poker would be fun (for me, maybe not so much for you, chuckle) but now a days there are cameras in the elevators.  And I do keep a deck of cards in my purse, along with toy tops, note paper and crayons.  I'm a grandmother now and at 5 and 1, they too, are cereal spillers.  Good choice, you're still a kid at heart!    Oh, in LA I worked in the basement and watched them repair elevators, escaping is not that hard anymore, nobody needs to stand on any-body's shoulders anymore.

bfxdJddlaa	Did he really say that?  Now I haven't heard that but if it is true, I have this to say:  It's horrible!  I never endorsed Obama, but now that he is President, I can only wish him the best and hope he succeeds.  My future rests in the decisions he makes so he'd BETTER succeed. and not only that, but he's our PRESIDENT.  It doesn't matter if we supported him or not during the election, he represents this country and since we all live in it, we need to stand behind him.  Rush Limbaugh would be stupid for saying something like that.  Hoping for the failure of our President, is hoping for the failure of our nation.  Way to be anti-patriotic.|`|7edl5u1oaa	Me, can't we just give the man a chance!|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	His response is in one ear out the other.  Ignore those on their soapboxes.  Who really cares?  He's not in office.    d|`|7iwVX51saa	I doubt he WANTS him too.  I'll have to hear that for myself.|`|764cf8bcce5b69aa33ca2c53123cdf3daa	Rush is doing what Rush has been doing forever.  Obama will always have that kind of pressure from somewhere.  If you can't handle it, get out of politics!|`|CLyLHTFlaa	Well I personally love how not only in my neighborhood, and on my street even, I have to deal with gangs and drug deals.  And I'm so super stoked that Obama will be letting terrorists live in my neighborhood soon.  I also just don't get why anyone would want Obama to fail when he has granted us this wonderful gift!|`|GBKmKmGiaa	He said he wanted his socialist policies to fail. Watch the entire interview with the quote in context and make your decision, don't just take NBC's unreliable word for it.    Edit:     "that's then going to set the stage for everything being government owned, operated, or provided. Why would I want that to succeed? I don't believe in that. I know that's not how this country is going to be great in the future; it's not what made this country great. So I shamelessly say, "No! I want him to fail." If his agenda is a far-left collectivism -- some people say socialism -- as a conservative heartfelt, deeply, why would I want socialism to succeed? "    In context the quote is obviously a reference to the agenda that Obama has and Rush is saying that IF he has a far left socialist agenda he wants him to fail. He is not saying he wants him to fail automatically, he is saying he wants the radical agenda to fail if he pushes for one. I would advise reading the full transcript to get the context of the quote.    This is why I think it would be terrible if he actually said that, but in the context it was spoken I do not find it aweful, especially after the multitude of genuine hateful comments that were thrown at our last President.|`|prUFmKofaa	That's terrible, but unfortunately some idiots want him to fail just to prove that Mccain is better which in my opinion, he isn't. :P They don't realize that if they just supported him instead of being so negative things would be better :P And I don't think they care that if he did fail (which I don't think he will) it affects them too...|`|qo7Iix3xaa	Of course its horrible. You should never hope that the President fails, and to all the people doubting Limbaugh said this, watch this.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	His ignorance never ceases to amaze me, but his wants and needs are of absolutely no concern to me.  When he talks, all I hear is blah, blah, blah.   I guess he forgets that if the president fails...the people fail...as we've found out in the last 8 years....|`|U0KCmsKXaa	Did he actually say he "wants" Obama to fail or did he say he "thinks" Obama will fail?  I didn't see the whole interview, but the context and wording does make a difference.  But the way I see it, Americans have a right to express their opinions.  Just because Rush Limbaugh (along with many others) aren't slobbering all over the celebrity of Obama doesn't make him a bad American and a bad person.  I'm not saying I'm necessarily a Rush fan -- he's a little too outspoken for me -- but he has every right to say what he wants about Obama.  For God's sake, haven't you people been complaining about and cursing Bush for the past 8 years?|`|00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	a lot of people|`|snjdyvlmaa	I know,    There is no point to it at all.|`|O3SN4vx1aa	4-8 years ago O'Reily and Limbaugh went on ranting and raving that we the American people are obligated to support our president we elected (then Bush). their tone has changed now someone else is in office.|`|Vh9P5P60aa	He's entitled to his opinion, and although I don't agree with Rush's negativity, I disagree with Obama's agenda even more...|`|qzfkEgKgaa	true that|`|RtJ11zUZaa	I think it's wrong to want any President to fail.|`|dxVpLM38aa	why not isnt rush limbaugh the biggest failure of all misery loves company.|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	Rush Limbaugh is a puke in every sense of the word.  His opinions on anything mean nothing to me.|`|IPpOd2wmaa	include a link.|`|KZDkJyjFaa	what do you expect from a pill popping buffoon.|`|zQrEhWAKaa	i think that it is horrible and i am not even from the US but i love Obama.|`|ltDPK4UFaa	I agree with you.  He is OUR president, as in the entire country.  Wanting him to fail affects everyone.  He isn't just the president for the people who voted for him.  Is he seriously that desperate to prove a point?  Disagree with what he does all you want, but wanting him to fail is just too much in my opinion.|`|Kp46I3W4aa	I THINK IT'S BAD

I just wouldn't like living in Rhode Island ... the whole New England region is a big turn-off seeing as how I try to avoid Metro Boston.      him or Alex Trebek, so I could kill myself.          the countryside sounds boring.  I hate driving in the boonies just to go skiiing.  whenever I drive to New York, Washington, Atlanta (llloooooooooong @ss drive) or Chicago, there are these huge swaths of countryside that I am thankful I don't live in.  ...

Youre no fun anymore :(    *walks away disappointed*|`|4GiIXWUXaa	No, no, no you're all wrong.     It's slap the babby, punch the mom in the head for letting her babby choke, then scream, "Annie, Annie, are you okay?!" as you pound her chest with your fist before you give the babby mouth to mouth.    *sighs*      What are they teching you kids these days?    No "fingersweeping"? ABC's are still relevant right?  xoxo  ?|`|057SUuSYaa	What about old perverted men?  We like to get slapped too ya know!|`|TUi2BBCraa	Is the babby breastfeeding at the time?  Because she should really be doing that in private.

That said tho, if im ASKED, then that's another story; i would deff. tell the truth|`|Ui7a7y3Caa	of course tell someone the truth even if it hurts. in the long run they should respect you for the decision to make a bold statement by standing up to them and telling whatever it is.  If it is bad news....wouldnt you rather them hear it from you than finding it out from someone they do not care so much about.  It could haunt you if you do not speak up and tell them the truth, it is because you love them you are having issues deciding if you should|`|AA10885826	well it really depends on what it is if like you see your girls man cheating i would tell the truth if its small like a friend said another friend is fat uly or stupid something petty i wouldnt say anything it hurts someones feelings for nothing they dont need to hear it they already know so in my eyes     if its petty and it wont make a difference whether you lie or not i would just omit the information     if it is something that someone needs to know i would tell the truth b/c not telling them could get them hurt worse in the future       i think you should always think would i want to know if i was in their shoes|`|B1GjfOUdaa	The truth may hurt at times but honesty is the best policy.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Little white lies sometimes.

If you tell someone the truth and it hurts their feelings, they will eventually realize that you were right and come back with more trust. Lies, on the other hand, will do us no good. Even if there is no immediate consequence, karma always comes back on us.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Yes always tell the truth. Most of the time if you lie it ends up hurting the person much worse than if you had told the truth to begin with.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	I would tell the truth!

6gthdHpnaa	Hollister and Aeropostale. That is the ONLY THING anybody ever wears, and it all looks the same.  And the emo thing. It desensitizes self-injury/cutting, which is an issue that needs to be addressed now before more teenagers get ruled off as "emo" and not helped with their problem. It should NEVER be considered cool or stylish.  And people saying "Your mom" all the time. It doesn't make any sense, it just makes them look stupid.|`|dprURFLxaa	skinny jeans|`|a002ffcbd40afa45e8f5b3068f771ffcaa	the ugly scene/emo thing. it's so annoying!|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Reality show participants being considered A-list celebrities.|`|B2duikyaaa	saggy pants|`|O3SN4vx1aa	wearing condoms.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Skinny jeans... especially on guys|`|mNC4r3EIaa	Fanny packs.|`|0f14c0173f9efbdc6efd2cf872b13fe1aa	ugly emo haircuts.    like do they really think it's cute??? it literally looks like you handed a pair of scissors to a 3 year old and said "this hair is your playground!"    not to mention the fact that these haircuts look like they stink. eeee-uuu-wwww.|`|78w480nqaa	I agree with the Chuck Norris jokes, my brother sends me them everyday!!!

UBxKqdPwaa	Yes, and it often hurts my feelings.  I am probably the most honest person alive but to be accused of dishonesty really gets me down.

Its just the way our world is now.

YX1ddnXmaa	flavor mingling...|`|lj8PbJugaa	Bangin and meatballs in the same sentence?  Sounds Grrrrreat to me!    Cause they sit in the juices and suck up flavor.  And cuz I didn't have to cook again.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	yup your right it takes some time for the flavors to soak it into the food|`|ee5d94d202c1ba2f1c1e242ec1d4ec20aa	like everything it gets better with age...even bangin|`|AA10809514	Chili and most soups are the same. Takes time for the flavors to blend. Much the same as enjoying a Lady's pleasures. The longer it goes, the better it gets.|`|vtiea9eTaa	Some dishes need more time for the flavors of the ingredients to come out and mix together properly for the full flavor which is why some foods taste better as leftovers. Stews soups, and homemade spaghetti sauce are good examples. Other times we just enjoy the dish so much it tastes just as good the second time we eat it. BBQ and Italian are some of mine. I thought "bangin" is only allowed to be used in the Maintenance & Repairs or Singles & Dating categories. Hmmm. = )|`|AA10378030	The flavors incorporate longer which makes it much tastier..|`|764cf8bcce5b69aa33ca2c53123cdf3daa	The herbs saturate the food more over time.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	It all depends on how your brain depicts the senses|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Yes and Yes    SteveC  ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|Hd1XNzTqaa	i have no idea  but cold pizza is the best!|`|6pk6HnuSaa	do you really wanna talk about the proper use of "bangin"? ?    I think it's because some foods thicken - others thin, some meld the flavors - and some just taste better when they are beginning to go bad|`|M7W7lZBBaa	Because the flavors have more time to marinate    bangin|`|BwZJXbSjaa	something will be bangin at my house tonight|`|O3SN4vx1aa	pizza too|`|XmD61yBpaa	'Coz we are natural scavengers|`|S1KINm2Paa	Leftover pizza is amazing. And yes, you used bangin right. lol|`|iE7nwMVnaa	Yeah I know, so does Chinese Food!    Lol, yeah you used Bangin right.|`|oeeT4Zlqaa	I don't know but that really annoys me why can't food be good all the time? Like McDonalds for instance, as soon as it gets cold you might as well throw it away.|`|TlcMyJeuaa	I hope you really enjoy your bangin' balls of meat.|`|a8mQuc4iaa	i have no idea    i love cold pizza  and egg fried rice      mmmmmmmmm|`|elY5vkVyaa	With some foods the flavors are concentrated when they are re-cooked; stew is a good example and bubble&squeak turns left over cabbage and potato into something tasty with the addition of a fried egg.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	Yes you did, and cold Pizza is salmmin!|`|IPpOd2wmaa	i like your hair|`|brKxytiXaa	b/c they do|`|SvdFzKs4aa	i dont no but i agree with u|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	Freshly made lasagne or anything italian.  Yes it is bangin' and you spelled it correctly.  Good job!!    d|`|jBKiD5ugaa	You did indeed....Chili and homemade chicken stew are always better the second day!|`|JpjSGtCnaa	Seasonings and spices have had time to sink in.|`|fb5ac5faab424efb3d1e35f8fd315050aa	Because the seasoning has time to work through it.|`|Gn8EhYRuaa	I DONT AGREE|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	cause the flavor sinks in more
Orx9cTJJaa	Are you sure you're a Christian? Ask this over in R&S, they'll love you. By the way, it's called cocaine.

I'm not religous in any way. other people have their own business. I answer questions if i can. Saying "you fail at life" is negative and i try to stay positive and telling someone that a lot might give them the idea that they will and there isn't any point in trying for something. I might be rambling on and on about something that you don't care about but hey.. you asked.. i answer.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	IDC either way - I dont need to hear things to know they are/arent true?|`|c6P3LmGiaa	jesus dosen't love you      because who is someone to tell me that i fail at life..I WOULDN'T CARE|`|DOoHDBTiaa	jesus doesnt love you|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	The stupid commercials on tv................|`|vj6YpJn8aa	If Jesus doesn't love me then my life would be a failure.

Anyway that jesus doesn't love me Think about it would you rather have the man that created you not like you or have some stupid dude you have a bad life while right now i bet you have people around you that love you.

lgIuhKN4aa	To contrast with what it actually means...|`|oeeT4Zlqaa	Because abbreviation is longer.|`|l4sBglTdaa	because if there were less letters it wouldn't sound right abbrevi|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Because it was derived from the Middle English word "abbreviatus" which was derived from the Latin word "abbreviare" which means to shorten, cut, or make briefer. It dates back to the 15th century so why don't you ask somebody from the 1400's. Maybe they can give you a better answer. k peace

dLt5mVHRaa	There were eleven people hanging onto a rope that came down from an airplane.     Ten were blonde, and one was a brunette.     They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't, the rope would break and everyone would die.     No one could decide who should go, so finally the brunette said, "I'll get off."     After a really touching speech from the brunette saying she would get off, all of the blondes started clapping.

Never before had Sue looked in the box that her husband kept under their bed.     The box had been there for the past 20 years of their marriage but she had never invaded his privacy. One day, while cleaning, she decided to take a look in the box. She didn't figure it was anything he was hiding since she could have looked at it any other time but hadn't.     In the box she found 3 eggs and 10 thousand dollars. This seemed very strange so she went to Fred and asked, "Why are there 3 eggs in a box under our bed?"     He replied, "Well, every time I was unfaithful to you, I put an egg in the box." Sue was surprised and hurt that he had been unfaithful but she consoled herself with the fact that they had been married for over 20 years and he had only been unfaithful 3 times.     "But where did the 10 thousand dollars come from?" she asked.     "Well, every time I got a dozen, I sold it."    2. A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor's office.     After his checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone. He said, "Your husband is suffering from a very severe stress disorder. If you don't follow my instructions carefully, your husband will surely die.     "Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant at all times. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him.     "Don't burden him with chores. Don't discuss your problems with him; it will only make his stress worse. Do not nag him. Most importantly, make love to him regularly.     "If you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your husband will regain his health completely."     On the way home, the husband asked his wife, "What did the doctor say?"     "He said you're going to die," she replied.|`|YKDhstvkaa	u can't really make a clean funny joke.|`|BpNrx9Viaa	Two solicitors walk into a bar,  one says "I smell **** in the air tonight, we's gonna make money."  the other says "no, I just burped."|`|e33VH6Csaa	A young woman on her honeymoon night discovers her husband has a missing foot.

JpjSGtCnaa	Party City   Google it, I came across a few back in Dec. when I needed one for a ball. I ended up buying one from Party City
CLyLHTFlaa	'tis a shame you don't want to put effort into your mask since it's a masquerade ball.  Any of those types of balls I've seen in movies, they go all out with their masks.  For example the movies:  Batman Returns, Labyrinth, Mary Antionette (sp?).  I guess if you really want plain and cheap, then check out the mask Mary Antionette wears in that movie during the masked ball.  Very simple, black, and different.  I am guessing you would not buy that mask.  You would make it.  P.S.  People's eyes will be more attracted to the ones who are wearing an elaborate mask, compared to a plain one.  Masks are to create intrigue and mystery.  To be noticed. -(ironically).|`|XmD61yBpaa	Dress as a man|`|78w480nqaa	dollar store or walmart|`|ReV6Cj06aa	you should make your own mask...cheaper and more unique|`|J2pGkgf7aa	Ahh the elegance of a masquerade ball!!! Since you already have you dress, You just need the mask??? There are many different ways to get your hands on one. But it depends on what type you want? What colors are your dress? Do you want a fabric mask or a plastic one? You could go to Romancing the Stone, or you could even find an authentic one at an Antique store!!! Just have fun looking for one.                       Good LUCK                             BCJ

ERgL2Dhpaa	yes! that always happens to me  or when you just find a new song, and then they wont stop playing it on the radio, and every ones like "like omg, i love this song!"   and you're like  god shut up, i found it first!|`|8wRvfMZZaa	I smell like cheese!|`|6OplSEQkaa	YES ME TOO!!!! LIKE JACK JOHNSON!!!!!!|`|J0G4lRrNaa	That's how the Jonas Brothers started out  . They are so overated now.  Before I didn't hate them or like them.  Now I strongly dislike them.|`|6Tw5bxXPaa	Part of my hates it cause I'm like, hey they're mine!  But another part of me is happy they are making some money and doing well.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Yeah. I used to do that with bands around my city. They hit the big time, I got mad. But it doesn't really matter to me anymore. I like being able to talk about a band without someone saying, "Who the heck are they?"|`|RiXZ4WRnaa	YES.  I feel like this all the time!  God, lol.|`|mxD3vkUQaa	Nah it's normal :)    I just always make I point i knew them first ;)    X|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Oh my gooodness!  Yes >:l When I hear people at my school or anyone talking about them and how they love them, I automatically start disliking the band and move on to the next ;) I guess I'm selfish about bands :p|`|LeRwXF64aa	I guess. I have a band too. Keep on trying. You'll get there someday!!!|`|7OE7ZNZsaa	no i like it when they make it big, it's nice to see a band that you like succeed rather than fade out into no where..|`|Dnf4ijdJaa	nope i feel the same way, i used to love P!ATD but no one even knew who they were, one year later they heard just ONE of their songs and fell in love with them and im like wtf?? now i dont like them anymore and it really sucks because they were a good band. that always happens to me and also with songs, oh well lol :]|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Sorry to hear that !|`|azdw8fMlaa	I feel that way about celebrities. I like certain people until they start getting a lot of attention in the tabloids and they become too famous. Then my interest fades. I say it's a change in their ego, but it could just be me wanting to be the biggest fan or something.|`|jt4PVBKkaa	idgi    (i don't get it)|`|58KUMpF0aa	In a sense, I can understand it.  It's more, with me, if one of their recordings are very rare and then the band gets famous and the recording gets rereleased.  I have Tori Amos' Y Kant Tori Read on vinyl and it's my prized possession and if I found out it got rereleased any time soon, I might feel bummed by that.  However, I would not want Tori to not be able to get royalties from it... even though she has stated she does not want it rereleased.
c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	I'd say it was 10 ten year olds.|`|b0LmNT2qaa	yea i think so  or a little older like eight years old. haha
0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	Umm, date a guy that doesn't like kids, ya... get serious with a guy that doesn't like kids, probably not.. I'm not sure I want kids, but I do have a nephew and if he can't be around my nephew at least, then I don't care to be around him! If kids were important to me, then I'd look for a guy who likes them too, but it's not a HUGE deal at this point.    Cheers =)|`|bvt9kvS8aa	No.. because I want daughters!|`|b8WZz6oRaa	no.. because I want kids when I'm older.. so if he doesn't like them then he isn't the one for me.|`|lBZkXzr0aa	Oh Heeeelllllll NO.  I have four and he ever say the wrong thing to them, about them  I would beat his azz and then let my kids beat him up too.|`|pCHg6y01aa	yeah|`|ZEP1K3oSaa	I'm a man so I don't date guys, but think if you like them and have them then yea you shouldn't date anyone who doesn't like kids period!    GAH|`|Z7z7aGiyaa	viva la raza|`|twVyisGnaa	I still date a girl who didn't want kids, but I won't really marry her.  Depends on how much I like her.  I still hope to have kids of my own someday.

gn1Y5N1Raa	some of us are thick, you need to tell us straight lol|`|3Nrb2CBXaa	i'm shy, so I'd let him figure it out.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	Hmmm. UH DEFINITELY let HIM figure it out!!! Or have my friends tell him...|`|YL0DypySaa	Tell him, if he doesn't get it after a while. But they usually get it. I'm not that subtle. XD|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	I'd smack him upside the head and say "wake up, I like you dummy" and walk off shaking my head...lol    I think I'd just step up the hints, I'm too shy to just tell them.. but you gotta watch that the hints aren't too much, like clinging to the guys neck and actin a fool...lol    Cheers chica =)|`|PIxBwUNoaa	If he's not getting it, you're not giving the right hints|`|XgVP6bjcaa	I'd Ask One Of My Friends To Tell Him. Or Ask Him.|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	i'd make sure to let him figure it out|`|Cq6b6yqaaa	For me, I won't send a hint to any guy whatsoever.|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	I'd let him figure it out. I couldn't bring myself to actually tell him.|`|6of3tqHhaa	I would flirt with him more if I thinked he liked me|`|VzzQP2PJaa	tell him..you only live once =)|`|ZEP1K3oSaa	OMG How old are you? Tell us we can't read minds!!!    GAH|`|5v7WecPbaa	tis best to tell him before it goes anyfurther, this could cause greater problems the longer u let him think otherwise|`|Rr1bh2P1aa	usually people know if i like them but i guess id tell him : )
mwv79AIhaa	looks like u got a new housemaid, put that kid to work and make him earn a new tv.|`|bgxsbK7uaa	make HIM earn some of the money for the tv, and if not, never let him use the tv|`|Q7iwOVkSaa	Try one of these ideas:  -buy another tv for yourself only and not for him  -make him work to save up money to buy it (odd jobs around the house or for neighbors)  -tell him that you don't need a tv anyway then don't buy another one|`|twVyisGnaa	Yeah, make him do something to pay for the damages of the tv.  Take him to work for a few days and make him do some work until he's payed off the debt.      If he's only a little kid, try some kinda extreme grounding suitable for a small child if he's under 10 years of age.  Do something to make sure that he never does this crap again.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Send him to his room with the broken tv and don't come out until it's working again.    No food, no potty, nuttin'.    That may get him out of your hair for the rest of his life and/or yours.|`|vvOyYDyCaa	how old is he?    if his age has anything with a teen in it....HE should save up for your tv.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	That's nice.................|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	Damn Nette, that bites the big one... but like you said, at least he's ok and didn't get hurt.  I would take away his TV privileges, and make him spend all of his free time in his room by himself for a while. If his room is fun,make it not fun, take his toys and whatever else away. Hitting and punishing in that way is not the solution, it's got to be punishment that actually hurts him and one he learns from.    He need to be taught a few lessons on how to control his anger, girl... damn, and he's only 7? WOW!    Good luck amiga =)

It's just a bunch of stodgy old farts that pick the same types of movies and the same types of actors year after year.  Yawn.  If I want an opinion on a particular film, I'll look to the masses for an opinion (a forum like yahoo answers is great for that), or I'll just take a chance and watch the film without an opinion.    I think that maybe Penn didn't win because Forrest Gump was just so greatly heralded by the aforementioned old farts that it barely got any recognition.  I personally think Penn is a phenomenal actor, but I didn't watch I Am Sam because I'm uncomfortable with intellegent actors portraying the mentally challenged.  He rules, though.  Did you see him in Dead Man Walking or The Assassination of Richard Nixon?  Geez, he was amazing in those and won an oscar for Mystic River (hmm perhaps those weren't old farts voting that year).|`|9KssW2reaa	Well. Sean is a great actor but honestly it was not his best acting, he such a nice actor but he will get his oscar. do not worry maybe this year with MILK

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	I'm really hoping all the guys say long hair, April. I've finally grown mine to about mid-back, because I've always been a sucker for long hair on a man. I've assumed these feelings were mutual.|`|AA10140520	I prefer long hair but it depends-some look good either way|`|fmHyfVmVaa	Really, I think that what matters most is the inner beauty shining forth. That is the true beauty of anyone. Hair is just hair.  Blessings!|`|MH8cR5bhaa	Not all women look good in long hair and not all women look good in short hair.

I used to have a full head of long hair (sigh). That was many thousands of years ago....back in 1970|`|kTc3bfrRaa	I  like both!!    most women look better with  long hair!|`|KIG9gWY0aa	I love long hair myself.  A preference I think is shared by most men.  However, I have found most women, unless they are younger, do not wish to spend the time it takes to keep their hair long.  So you will hear many men say I like long hair, but that shorter hair looks good to.  For the same reason no sane man would tell any woman that any outfit made her "look fat", no man will tell a women she is unattractive in her new short hair style.|`|PEWKoIOvaa	personally, i like the long hair. but i think a woman looks good when she feels good, no matter what kind of hair.|`|5JqCObDSaa	Generally speaking I would say long hair. I have sen some women with short hair and it looks nice on them, but usually long hair looks better and you can do more with long hair to. My husband prefers longer hair too and says a woman's hair is her glory. We have a longstanding joke with my beautician when I go to get my hair trimmed and he always tells her "don't take too much off now I don't want you to have her looking like me"(he is bald and keeps what little hair he does grow shaved)lol. Then he says can you give me a hair cut next and we both look at each other and say "I think he means a shine - there's nothing to cut". (he he)  I get a kick out of it all.|`|b5386939ea31dd59259dfcae19f7a25daa	I'm a sucker for Long hair few Women look good with Short Hair|`|PhIsI7Vgaa	Long hair... short hair i cant tell if they are guys or girls... i made that mistake once...|`|7BKmhV47aa	i have long hair =) i personally like long hair on woman better|`|Bh6NwFzeaa	Well. I have had short hair and now I have long hair.  I like the way my hair looks in a braid when I wear my motorcycle helmet.|`|KPDOrmTsaa	Generally speaking, I feel more feminine with longer hair.

bntYPTIkaa	i have played piano myself for 12 years. and i just began learning guitar. the guitar is much easier to play but i don't know any theory for guitar and how it works. i'm sure i can learn it if i wanted to but with piano it seemed like playing the piano also made you learn theory at the same time. with the guitar you can just get tabs and just learn to play. that's how i started and i sorta wish that i knew how to read guitar notes .also your dedication and the time you put into learning the guitar can dramatically make it easier.|`|5ttxuyHmaa	Free Streaming Video Guitar Lessons:    http://www.codeshredlessons.com/lessons....|`|p0Xw8hLZaa	my sister's bf taught me guitar, and I picked up on my first song in the first day.

hZegT1raaa	as good as robert downey jr. was in that movie, i am a big fan of johnny depp and in particular a big fan of the pirates series, so that's the way i'm going to go|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I enjoyed Iron Man and I thought RDJ did a really good job with it, but Johnny Depp just made the Pirates movies. That character was something really special in my opinion. He was perfect, and in a way that was incredibly creative. He really built something and nailed it.|`|jNn91TwDaa	Robert Downey Jr|`|2i6TPlauaa	Downey, Depp's Jack Sparrow was a bit 'eh' for me.      How about Bloom in 'Pirates..."? Magnificent, that man of no expression. No, Bloom's awful in everything I've seen him in.|`|YbmklSzGaa	Johnny Depp. I thought Iron Man was kind of overrated.|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Hmmm... they both did fantastic jobs, but I'd say Johnny Depp. Robert Downey Jr. PORTRAYED a character excellently, while Johnny Depp CREATED a character. Tony Stark was an already made character where Downey slipped into his shoes, but Depp, metaphorically, made a pair of shoes. Sorry if that was confusing.|`|7B2s7maWaa	Johnny Depp. I loved him as Captain Jack Sparrow.|`|6qPVGyNQaa	Johnny Depp|`|wEpwWVhJaa	There are flashes of knowing under the silly, gurning, self-called "Keith Richards impersonation" Depp otherwise phones in on a role he could never have expected to become so iconic. He does much better in Dead Man's Chest, with its darker undertones and deeper plot. his reaction to being chained to The Black Pearl is sublime. But RDJ just embodies his role as Tony Stark, at once effortlessly cool and tragically vulnerable.|`|6Tw5bxXPaa	Johnny Depp. That's a given.|`|RNpaBwxzaa	RD Jr.

fIK9LBEuaa	I think it's cool, but definitely couldn't handle that myself. It's just to much. Especially if all of those children had just 10 children each, which is quite possible, since they are all into having large families.     That's 180 grand children. In my opinion, that is just way to many. Are Michelle and Jim Bob going to be able to remember every one of their grandchild's names? Now imagine if those 18 kids had 18 kids. That is 324. That has to be some kind of record, right?|`|Tf19RETiaa	the mother is so calm its scary and there liike really old fashioned. mi dad came from a family of 10 and mi grandma was always a spaz lol|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	I say more power to 'em. When you have that many kids, you just have to be more organized, and run your house like a little school. You also have to be consistent with discipline. This is why homes that have large families are almost always Christian, because it teaches self-discipline.  The mother never has to call "Nanny 911". In fact, I find that Christian homes seem to have the best-behaved children.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	to many kids  if i would have 18 kids  i know i would lose some  like at the mall  in the house....so anywhere|`|y8wOnto7aa	I think that lady is a B*tch for popping out babies like that. what about the women who cant have kids? what the hell is somone gonna do with 18 kids? she makes me sick!|`|FjYqpTsuaa	i think they have just lost their damn minds!!! and now their kids will have 20 kids and this world will be way more over populated then it is... thats like people with special needs having kids! WHAT FOR?!?!!|`|fL7858DMaa	The problem with the Duggars (ok, just one of the many) is that they're part of the Quiverfull movement.     This movement is based on the fact that European ("white") race has been declining, and hardcore devout Christians believe that God thinks the "white" race is the best, so they "let god" give them as many kids as "he" wants, so they can rebuild the white race in praise of him.     Dont believe me? read about it sometime. its pretty f'ing awful.    this is why people dont like the Duggar family. they're terribly racist.. have you ever seen ANYONE on ANY of the Duggar shows that WASNT white? nope. not once.    It's a movement based on white God, loving white people.     I honestly think Jinger is going to break free. she seemed the most outgoing and the least crazy.

n3h9Byhpaa	Changing the subject|`|WpBQlRkQaa	It means there is a silence that needs to be filled with interesting conversation|`|WtTUNC8Naa	its usually a disrespectful way of trying to change the subject... basically what you were saying isnt of any importance to them, nor do they care to hear about.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	change subject NOW|`|jGRB7uSMaa	its kind of a flirting type of thing. or starting a new conversation so when a girl says "so anywayss".. they kind of expect you to say something like, what are you doing this wknd? or something like that|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Its usually a disrespectful way of saying "Lets change the subject"|`|W38RXqSsaa	moving right along to change the subject|`|qcuXR1Msaa	I usually use it after I've digressed in a conversation|`|yQl4fiJAaa	they got bored with what you guys were talking about and they're just trying to change the subject
AAgX0SDcaa	Yes, and it can also cause an the stress hormone Cortisol, which can result in Cushing's disease. I warned my niece to sleep more but she didn't listen and that's what happened to her.  You need deep sleep for your body to repair itself on a daily basis.|`|UPdJF0tyaa	i think.|`|bfxdJddlaa	you shoulda put something more PnS-ey then.   This is soo health!|`|boCczAN4aa	Yup...|`|hv9lGwdlaa	im not sure    thats the wrong category lol
6pk6HnuSaa	constantly? ?    no it "affects" there entire life - health and usually everyone around them    chronic sleep deprivation is toxic - trust me on that|`|txI8rKYdaa	Yes, greatly.|`|c3Ep0Ky3aa	Yes! Sleep greatly affects your mood.|`|531f6a6374dfe1e1a0a3027ce2dd7ae5aa	Yes.  :)|`|DnyyyGeEaa	yah, and believe me I know, because a I have an 8 month old baby. :-)|`|AEqOczcCaa	It can, but it depends on the person. I actually feel happy and energized when I go longs periods of time with only two hours of sleep each night.    Other people get grumpy, some become zombies, others act the same as they always do.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	In a way no, because I would think your body would adapt.  But in the long term yes I think it would affect you because your body needs a certain amount of sleep each night.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	I am the biggest crank if I don't get enough sleep.|`|eWfBYZA8aa	yes,If you are not relaxed,you can become stressed out,  if you get plenty of sleep you will feel much btter than if you havent.|`|BLEYaodFaa	Oh yes it does, not only that but continued sleep deprivation can effect a person physically too.|`|ztzL7ntwaa	yeah i get bitchy :(|`|4c5726b963122e60694b7e3e59161e71aa	yes. Esp. Children|`|QswdY6hcaa	Nope, not when I used to get 3-5h of sleep a night. I'd be tired but not moody. Maybe out of it, feeling like a zombie, but "happy".|`|LhEoVly0aa	i think it will affect everyone around you more lol|`|xx4MSADIaa	of course|`|b8WZz6oRaa	sometimes.. it depends what kind of person you are though.. and how you react to certain things|`|bfxdJddlaa	Um I usually go to sleep at 5 and wake up at around 11 and I'm fine.  Pretty mellow if you ask me.|`|InATuLotaa	It turns me into a zombie where my eyes are open but i'm actually sleeping, and then i'll be in a bad mood coz i'll hit a wall or something.|`|qDrhywAWaa	yep|`|P8I2Lmuxaa	yeah, it definitely effects your mood & the way u may take things|`|yQOsutn5aa	fact: you can never make up for lost sleep.|`|sYxZlwmjaa	yes it can make u tired, grumpy, (SLEEPY), cranky etc.|`|W5feTOckaa	Yes it will cause you to have bad mood swings|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Yes it affects my mood. I get very grouchy and hacked off with anyone and everyone. I cant concentrate on anything, esp if the insomnia carries on...|`|4F1Xllkbaa	it can. some people act silly, others get cranky. lack of sleep can do some freaky crap to people.|`|byOxixfuaa	That really depends.  If its the loss of sleep for one night, not really other than being slightly more prone to getting upset.  BUT  If the loss of sleep happens more than that, then yes. It affects your reactions towards things (leaning more towards being hostile/bitter). It slows down your reaction towards things and your attention span as well as more towards the cause to probably forgetting a few things. And it also makes your immune system weaken, making you more prone to getting sick.  It depends though on how much sleep deprivation you are getting and there's different classifications for each kind.
cMZEmpp0aa	I would have enjoyed it if they had actually put some effort into getting the costumes and dances accurate. Sayuri doesn't look anything like a proper maiko when she finally makes her transformation. There are several scenes where the characters have their kimono closed the wrong way. There are several more scenes where the characters are wearing outfits inappropriate for what they're doing. Sayuri's big dance was something a real geisha would never do or even come close to doing. I had such high hopes for the movie and, while those things might seem small, they completely ruined the experience for me -- especially the way they did Sayuri's hair and makeup when she was a maiko.|`|676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	that  is a great movie  i really liked it|`|a3ZZkY08aa	that was a really good movie! I would really like to find time to read the book---my friends said it was excellent...
yqCaXm8saa	My  Gay  Monster  Turd|`|qerFZWTfaa	I came on since I was confused on what to call them. Since they are now MGMT, do you still call them "The Management"?    Anyone...anyone...|`|wjA9ytO0aa	WTF?!?!! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^          prob because mgmt sounds cooler than managment duhhhhh

j6RbKNmjaa	Never|`|ovDqPtg8aa	yeah, it's soo cool! as long as you aren't some nerd who is obsessed with studyin ghosts and crap. bc then, it isnt even fun anymore bc they are trying to "contact" it the whole time in this weird @$$ way.  in school, my teacher had one, and this chick wen t crazy, telling her all about them, what a threat they are, adn how throw it away "safely."  then, she slapped me because i burned one... lol    but, yeah, they're awesome. ask it anything.|`|JL6rwdP3aa	yah i have.. it was pretty cool.. annd it was right about my bra size lol..  when i was younger i asked it that and to this day, it's correct!    |`|1cJJ2PfGaa	No, and I don't plan too, I think its risky business =)|`|tIj5bDRNaa	yeah many years ago when I was at secondary school.....I don't recommend it!.........scared the life out of me and my friends even if it is a load of rubbish your mind can play tricks on you especially at a vulnerable age|`|it3ecbVEaa	yes when younger, we had one at work and went into a store cupboard during our lunch break, it told my cousin that her dad was going to be in a car accident and killed, we just threw the board in the corner and never went near it or any other again,  2 years later her dad was killed in a car accident along with 4 other people. we never spoke about what it had said, but it did say a woman's name also, and she was in the car with him on the fate full day...this is a true story i am not into telling lies..as far as i am concerned they are not to be messed with.|`|53PJZstkaa	at a party i went to they did it and i was way fraked so i left the room.  they told me the girl who brought it asked it really scary stuff.    A few weeks ago the girl had another party and we were listening to ipods and then turned them off. we were laughing about stuff then it turned on and played a totally diff song.|`|yxofGMnTaa	me and my friend did one for like 3 hours once talkingto a ghost from Vietnam, he said he was guna marry her and they would open a coffee shop and he was guna murder me when I'm 99 lol. my friend said that one time she did it with a bunch if friends and they set it up with like candles and everything and they asked it for a sign of it's presence and stiff started flying off of shelves. me and my cousins have asked it some pretty personal stuff though and it usually answered right though, so I'd say I'm a believer. it's pretty cool as long as you're not really scared or anything.|`|gYThMID8aa	No but I know people who have and it had a profound effect on them. Don't even think about trying if you are the least bit mentally fragile.|`|FBR7cMshaa	i've been present a number of times while its been done and its truly freaky. we used a homemade board and a glass to do it. its definitely true,some people say that the participants move the glass themselves.its true,you can move the glass away from yourself but not draw it towards yourself with the tip of a finger.  be prepared for some startling answers and its advisable not to ask about death. the last time we did it we were in contact with a participants relation. we started off joking but the smirks were fast whipped off our faces. we each asked it personal questions no-one else could have known like the ages of grandparents when they died,middle names of relations and so forth.we also asked it to predict the future on some stuff.im not joking here honestly but we were all crying by the time we finished and we were all in our twenties and mostly male. its really freaky,even the sound of the glass moving around is creepy!  i recommend you stay away from it but have respect for it if you do.

VijJYZznaa	Get "Leprosy". If you like "Human" more then get "Symbolic". Personally, I prefer "Spiritual Healing" onwards than the first 2 albums.    MA: "Pull The Plug"|`|asxlJSPBaa	Leprosy.(:  Zombie Ritual :]|`|UDqQNYglaa	If I were you, I would get Scream Bloody Gore.  On Human, Death got a little more technical, so buying their first album, Scream Bloody Gore, is seeing their most brutal side. Both albums are epic wins, but I know I like Scream Bloody Gore better than Leprosy, so maybe you will too.|`|KKx8Mb63aa	I like Scream Bloody Gore more.    MQ: Zombie Ritual|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Ah, you came to the right place.  My specialty!    Scream Bloody Gore is top shelf.  Leprosy is right there with it.  You can't go wrong with either one, really.  Just go in order of their release dates!  Start with Scream Bloody Gore, then get Leprosy.....  Zombie Ritual is my fav' Death song.|`|u8ia6oKxaa	I'd say leprosy is all-round better, Scream Bloody Gore is somewhat repetitive except for a couple songs...Leprosy has better song structure and has more thoughtful lyrics...However, my favourite song is "Mutilation" from Scream Bloody Gore    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYAQvt3cB...    "Mutilation!!!!!!!!!!!!!"    MA: Pull The Plug, classic DM song      I would also suggest "Individual Thought Patterns" over "Human".  Both are similar style's but ITP has the best lineup(Gene Hoglan, Steve DiGiorgio, Andy LaRocque),  and is overall a better album IMO  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYy2bki-q...|`|uyQppMYLaa	Scream Bloody Gore. It's a classic album. It's great.

If I were a billionaire I'd do the same as Bill Gates and give away money, but I'd sneak around finding normal honest people who are struggling and give them just enough to allow them to get out of debt........ WITHOUT them knowing who did it.             I heard a story about an Australian exec and his people travelling in America. When he stopped at a diner they said they were closing.  He asked would they stay open long enough to feed his men.....but they said no.    One of the waitresses said if they would like to come back to her place,she would cook the five well dressed guys in the limo breakfast herself.    After breakfast was over, and the guys were washing the dishes for her, the tycoon asked where her husband was.     She told him he had hightailed outta there leaving her with two kids and a morgage, so she had to work at the diner most nights.    How much is it that you owe on the house he enquired.    When she told him she owed $200,000 he pulled his cheque book out and said  "well mam.....you don't anymore."    They drove away after an excellent meal leaving a lady in HER doorway with tears running down her face.    True story.     The tycoon's name was Kerry Packer.|`|zDmGngXVaa	You people are MEAN!!!!

6pk6HnuSaa	I noticed that LGBT thing too - seems they want P&S people to "change" ?    and there is still a lot of racism/discrimination EVERYWHERE - I believe the majority is REVERSE these days though, its just the "conventional" racism is just so visible when it exists - the reverse kind hides|`|1ayX5jmsaa	Not just in the south.

Its 2009 people.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	yes|`|elECfJ52aa	Depends on where you are    because they can|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	I believe there is racism in every State.|`|zG1m1eXxaa	According to one branch of the KKK they now have more members in the northern states than in the Southern ones, Racism is a world-wide issue it even exist in Africa where there is racism towards white people.

I don't like them much  I think that some people will say yes to your question, because they don't really like the Jonas Brothers that much.    I like Hayley Williams from Paramore..    http://s43.photobucket.com/albums/e386/j...|`|D3fsk3SCaa	It's only because you're old.  I looked at a few of your pin-ups like David Essex...he isn't very good looking. I don't think Miley Cyrus is average looking... compared to most teen girls I've seen today. They're only average looking to you because they don't wear those old "hairspray" styles...     Most teen girls today are obnoxious little prats...the only difference? they're not famous.|`|AA10859773	I don't think they're any worse than ours were.  It's probably just that you're older now and teenyboppers don't appeal to you - and be thankful for that!  You don't want to entertain the thought of mixing it up with a young'un!|`|meLGAZLcaa	I agree.    "Miley Cyrus??? What an obnoxious little prat" I couldn't have put it better myself|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	Well...my teen pin ups of the moment would be McFly if I were a teen. Being nearly 20 I class myself as adult...and would still have McFly as my pin ups....they ARE hot. well done to young girls who fancy them, good taste!    I agree tho, the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus are all so normal looking.|`|XvvZFkTRaa	You're right, we were used to a higher calibre!  The likes of Donny Osmond, David Cassidy, David Essex (my personal favourite!).....ahhhh.  Happy days.|`|2MZZ7Wtwaa	I think Teen idols in years gone by were a lot more mature than the ones we have today, and it showed in their presence.|`|bDPU6qWiaa	your looking a bit nauseas Doris,my pinups were the beatles,stones,monkees,there were many to choose from|`|WWJSJpwFaa	not the same as they used to be|`|3qa3BftUaa	No. They'll never be another David Cassidy. He was so georgeous|`|a6YQviyjaa	amen!|`|NQxluCb4aa	im 19 but hate jonas brothers and miley cyrus|`|95SFaABxaa	David Cassidy 4 ever!|`|of5pm6ACaa	Nah!|`|EsgKr5z8aa	100 percent agree.    Why cant anybody see that the Jonas Brothers are GEEKS.|`|ufSXgO1Baa	When you just look at what Disney has to offer then yes, the talent scale goes waaay down (I consider Corbin Bleu and Lucas Grabeel of High School Musical fame to be the exception to this rule and admit to huge crushes on the both of them - Lucas more because he's breaking out of the Disney mould)  However, there are way more teenage pinups around. In fact I think we're saturated with them. Any handsome young actor or singer/rock star instantly becomes a pinup. I've yet to see one stick around in such a high profile as David Cassidy or Donny Osmond though, so perhaps you have a point. Then again, I don't really see the appeal of either in their heyday. Maybe tastes have changed over the generations? Androgynous good looks certainly seem to be a more common feature for today's male heartthrobs. Can't really speak for the female ones...don't pay that much attention. I am saddened that Miley Cyrus does seem to be the biggest idol for girls atm. She is annoying...yet better than Paris Hilton.    Wow, that was a ridiculously long answer...|`|xxSGhywoaa	When I was a teen, I never used to have teen pinups because they were all ugly.  I haven't looked at a teen magazine in like 10 years (I would've been 14).        PS:  I really really love your Avatar!

f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	It's important, to a certain extent.    I'm a firm believer that every sign is compatible with any other sign, provided that you are willing to put up with or ignore certain things.  If not, then only date signs that you're compatible with (in your case, you would be compatible with other the Earth signs, Virgo and Taurus, and Water signs Scorpio and Pisces, Cancer being your opposite).  If, however, you're willing to be open, feel free to date anyone.    I personally love Aquarians.  I love how they question everything instead of just taking everything that's given to them.  They're funny and opinionated.      The problem with a lot of astrology is that most of it is based on assumptions.  According to 'cheap' astrology, Capricorns are supposed to be these stodgy, boring people who work and complain all day, which is why we're often said to be incompatible with Aquarius.  The truth is, Capricorns have a great sense of humor (it's dry humor, really, like sarcasm) and we're open-minded as well.    Good luck!|`|ykIleAQ7aa	It's important when you use it right. When you just go off sun signs you're only getting surface information that is helpful but may not give the insight you need. When you go over your complete charts you can see where you may have some troubles or what the weaker parts of your relationship is and be able to work with it. Also you'd be able to expect certain behaviors each other and it won't be a surprise - maybe more of an exception of each other without getting mad. Also you can see where you're really good and your strengths. Both as a couple and individuals.|`|AA11775528	I don't believe its extremely important. Unless Astrology is your way of life but in my situation I am a virgo and my husband is a ram. It said we are completely opposites but I believe i am in the best relationship i could ever be in. Oh and we've been together for 6 years and married for 4.|`|Znzx92mEaa	I have never put much faith in matching because of astrology.

I have several different themes that are recurring, one where jumping turns into floating or hovering, an amusement park where others die around me, and snakes. Apparently recurring or same dreams mean you've haven't rectified or paid enough attention to the problem from your sub conscious. Or that the problem has cropped up again and your brain has identified that this symbolism has the most meaning for you|`|PmZIiP8jaa	yeah usually several nights in a row|`|kTc3bfrRaa	not very often....

AA10811784	No, I don't think she looks fat at all. In fact, she looks great! MUCH better than looking like a skeleton like some celebrities. But that is another subject.|`|imXPYucSaa	whatever tara said.  that and she is dumb, annoying, terrible actress and her music sucks.  but she is pretty hot.  seems that and some luck is all you need to be a celebrity nowadays.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I don't think she's fat at all.

And I really don't feel bad for her that the media's drawing attention to it.  I couldn't care less what she does, to be honest, she's a very pretty woman.  But ... when you have no problem wearing skimpy clothes in photos and videos and using your figure as a vehicle for your career, you have to expect that the media is going to draw attention to it when you put on weight.  Don't you think?  And for people saying that she looks better now, well, honestly, no she doesn't.  She was definitely looking healthier, more toned and athletic during her Daisy Duke era.  Extra weight just isn't healthy ... and she was never "too skinny" as some people are saying.  It is what it is, she put on some weight ... but that doesn't necessarily mean that that's what "real woman" is supposed to look like as many are saying now that these pictures are surfacing.|`|Y6Bkhgokaa	She has gotten bigger, but not fat. I think her outfit actually makes her appear bigger than she is. It is annoying how people were saying that she is too skinny and now they are saying she is fat.|`|9qU9ojuDaa	no no they'v just widened the picture''?

Z0nooDxDaa	i do, i loved that actor. he was enevr in the media, kept himself to himself and was like no other celebrity out there, he never wanted the attention from the media and i respect him for that.|`|AEaB7xNRaa	Only when I watch a film with him in etc. Everyone thinks I'm really sad.|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	No...and if he does win the Oscar, it's on Sympathy, not because of a quality performance!    Jack did it better!    Having said that, I feel sorry for his daughter, whom will never know him except through the movies he was in, and the memories of people who love her. The real thing is better.|`|jkvELDIFaa	Verne Troyer misses him he said so on Big Brother got quite emotional about it.|`|PrqCDZ7raa	No, sorry.|`|DIEih5asaa	I had never heard of him till he died.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	It was a shame he lost his life so young he was the same age as me.I saw the dark knight and he was very good in that movie he stole the show.Allot of great people die young.Its true what they say the good die young.    Bruce lee died aged 32 he was at the best he could be and now heath ledger and there are many others|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	Never heard of him, Till?|`|AA10711210	Nope. All celebrities come and go; some sooner, some later.

There are loads of people, tons even, who miss Heath Ledger.|`|WkSjf4PQaa	Yes. Not in a weird way, like actually missing him on a day-to-day basis! But when I watch any of his performances, I do think of the great talent he had, and how he could have done so much more had he not died so young.  I especially like the film "Candy". Not his best-known film, but it's very good, and I think his acting in it is amazing.

cIZS6Wr2aa	I don't know what you mean exactly by violated but I had a really psycho stalker once.  It was really scarey like you said.  He hated Christians, especially me he said he hated my avatar!  It was an eye.   He would answer my questions with abusive and threatening answers.   He was so obsessed with me that he would answer other's questions abusively about me mentioning me by name.  He would reply to Christian questions that his fav dream was seeing piles of flaming dead Christians.      There wasn't the blocked option back then and one day I went through his questions to see if he wrote anything else about me and I found this question where he was clearly pretending to be stalked and asked if someone was stalking him online, could the stalker find out who they really were and where they lived.  What he was really trying to find out was if HE stalked someone, could he find out who the person was and where they lived.   And I think he was referring to stalking me!     At that point I e-mailed yahoo and alerted them that I might have a dangerous stalker.  They passed the buck uninterested and told me to contact the online police.  I did and they said the person never personally threatened me so there was nothing they could do about it.  I wrote back and said, "What do I have to do, be found dead before you take this seriously?!"       Well, my hands were tied and I was scared and at that point I gave it to Jesus in prayer and miraculously, he never posted any more questions after that even though his account was still there.  Trust him and He will take care of your stalker, too.  There are some mentally unstable people online.   We have to be careful never to cross them.  I made the mistake of answering him back once.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Pray to Jesus for protection, and don't give out any personal information.  As a rule, I try not to talk to MEN online.  I try to only deal with women.  That just keeps me away from stalkers, and also keeps my marriage safe.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	not me...

I weigh 135 lbs, and i consider myself fat and i can go skinny dipping, bltch...    Can skinny people be as stupid as you??  yeah, that's what i thought.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Yes, they do.. But I don't [I'm a prude what can I say].    And Coolio. . . I'm sure even the most obese person floats.. If not, that's what water noodles are for.|`|eAarsjjMaa	Yeah, unless they're so fat that they would sink.|`|5cfnDmI7aa	yes but the water level rises|`|ICTqyQaraa	no. the lake will dry up cause all the moisture would go into their rolls|`|q9BItD25aa	Yes, and skinny people can chew the fat|`|4NZSqs3Daa	lol ya|`|GBGcI509aa	NO.    Chunky Dunk Fool!|`|P93I8CHtaa	yes they can|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	No. They go Chunky Dunking.  =P|`|AA11367986	Yes, but it's called "chunky-dunkin"|`|NXrYtxFmaa	one day your gonna be fat, serious.|`|71LKbJV5aa	I'm pretty sure anyone can take off they're clothes and jump in water.|`|6Gx7Bnniaa	it's called chunky dunking, but yes|`|BAQf7prLaa	It's called Chunky-Dunkin'|`|1Czh9SGLaa	lol. yess. but which came first? the chicken or the egg?|`|26bxbVPxaa	That is very shallow.|`|lnZyIc6Haa	Of course.....  It would be like dunking do-nuts.|`|TdiuwtM5aa	yeah but make sure they have on the proper clothing they can go skinny dipping as long as it is not a plastic pool|`|qMVOV9t4aa	I like your avatar.  Sure just as much  as anyone else.|`|gZbGTXtbaa	Not If, When They Jump In, All Of The Water Jumps Out !!!|`|IjpJanM0aa	Heck yeah they can.  No different then a skinny person doin it.  I swear some ppl are just fucken straigh up rude.|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	yes  theyres just more of them to love sometimes i wished i was fat people keep calliong me anerexic.|`|72y9DpFwaa	Why not?  Does it really matter the size of the person as does one's body weight define who the person is?  If any person regardless of age, race, or size chooses to skinny dip then this is their choice and their business not mine.  I think society is putting too much pressure on the body image these days.  Everyone has a place and not all people who are heavy are that way by choice some people have medical conditions that contribute to the excessive weight and can not afford the medical care to correct it.  So Yes they can and should.|`|0jN3rO72aa	in that case it's called chunky-dunking|`|PzCoXyBraa	that is so mean!  :(|`|PIxBwUNoaa	yes|`|KJpcFq2Haa	Can they? Yes, should they? No|`|tNvz2JLiaa	please dont let them, Its worse than that movie Free Willy|`|a151bazgaa	Yes they can, but i would never wanna be around! That is so nasty.    hahaha, i just got a nasty image of a fat gu trying to go skinny dipping in a hot tub with loads of girls. hahaa. don't ask.:D|`|O7X7W1Mnaa	Yes.  The word skinny relates to dipping in your skin.  It has nothing to do with skinny vs fat.|`|kW56ncR6aa	depends if the fat person defines themself as fat or if they feel they have a weight problem.......near the mark Matt! :)
cU6cHvL3aa	i dunno....go make a cow laugh and find out. :)
6pk6HnuSaa	yes - just dont sniffle ?|`|dST3XrkNaa	Yes, it would just increase water level. My eyes can definately cry out water under water...

Peace  :-)|`|N9cvnMQCaa	Interesting question. I never thought of that but I don't think you can.    Listen, please do me a favor and thumbs me up if my answer was good and if it was bad please thumbs me down! Thanks so much!|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	i never thought about that|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Yep, sure can...........|`|pKrsOPOkaa	IDT. :]|`|106uKaEYaa	Nah!|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	Oh yeah.    d|`|zYAgbF49aa	Eeeep !!!

Yes.  Will it show? No.|`|bRZP0nkPaa	ya we can . why not ?|`|JVSFEPLSaa	be kinda hard when people usually start breathing eratically when they cry. And since there is a little bit of an air problem under water... well..you know..|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Probably.|`|Os0s1Usvaa	yes|`|5MeggG3Laa	yep, ive done it|`|bAKiEh3Laa	Yes, I once cried underwater when Someone ripped of my shorts at a pool party. it was so embarressing. I had to wait for everyone to leave before I got out and ran home.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	no.|`|AA10378030	I guess if you can cry in the shower you can still cry under water.|`|eArLd5taaa	Yes      But why would you cry underwater!?|`|PIxBwUNoaa	naw....it's such a happy place!|`|DbFjaY0Iaa	wow that's a good question!  idk if u can or not but i would like to know!|`|uuB06LSuaa	yes you would but no one would notice|`|8dlvGqi7aa	i dont think so|`|1dYGTAOAaa	yea and you eys wll start hurtig whnyoget outof it you SMUTT|`|R00Fq3Azaa	Yes you can but make sure not to breathe while doing it ;)|`|aavNyOeyaa	yes, its the same thing as "building up a sweat" if your swiming in a pool. The water will just spread it out so that it doesn't look like your crying.|`|71LKbJV5aa	I'm sure you can  =D|`|DaFIrZVxaa	Yes i guess but your tears would mix with the water surrounding you.|`|6hdFh8yZaa	yes u cann
G4wGCghdaa	Isn't Argument Clinic just a synonym for Marriage?  I grew up a Monty Python addict still sick and twisted to this day.

More effective than cash..........yeah right!|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Well, it wouldn't add to my anger. I don't need this, though. I have no trouble finding arguments.
sVlFl2dbaa	booo booo booo - Darnitt!!!! I knew Sh'HOE'ran would do this.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	They are/will be proud of it because as far as they're concerned it's payback, it's karma and all the other adjectives that justifies Nick's continuous cheating pattern. I wish Nick and Sharon have their fling and then she tells him go take a hike, but as you said, she's no better than Phyllis is she!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I did hear a spoiler that says Sharon and Nick make love....    Also Brad supposedly takes a bullet for Sharon.  I am thinking that Phyllis is going to be the one firing that bullet....    Phyllis has gotten way out of control and being the old Phyllis she was back in the day.  Nick is getting sick of it and I don't blame him at all.|`|msQqxMIbaa	I'm loving it!  I hope that Nick and Sharon get back together.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Ah I am so disgusted with the way this story line is going, Fine if Nick and Phyliss are going to break up whatever but why do they have to put him back with boring needy Sharon.|`|AA10653749	Well what about Brad ?  I thought that Brad was going to have an accident at some pond !    I'm not happy with Nick & Sharon getting back together they were so boring together !|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	I love it!!! SHICK fan all the way!!!|`|AA11511615	Yay!! (clap, clap, clap) I have always wanted Nick and Sharon back together!!  Phyllis needs to go back to Jack. She and he are great together.  Phyllis just looks like she is so much older than Nick to me.  Go Sharon and Nick!!!|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	The spoiler doesn't say that Sharon and Nick have sex.  I'll have to wait and see what happens before making the assumption that Nick and Sharon are getting together after this one.  Too many times the writers tease the viewers with their little stunts.    As far as Sharon doing what she said she would not do ... I think Phyllis deserves whatever she gets.  She's responsible for what Sharon is going through.  She was partly responsible for Sharon and Nick's marriage breaking up, and she was fully responsible for what's going on with Jack.  And, with all her back-stabbing schemes, she has no-one else (but herself) to blame for Nick getting tired of trying to explain to her and straying away from her.    The difference between Sharon and Phyllis is that Sharon doesn't play tricks to get men away from their husbands, like Phyllis has done at least twice ... once to take Danny away from Cricket by claiming that she was pregnant with Danny's child, and once to have a full-blown affair with Nick while Nick was married to Sharon and she was married to Jack ... and then get pregnant from this one.    At one time I liked Phyllis.  And if she finally does the right thing and stops intentionally hurting people, I might start to respect her again.  But I don't feel one bit sorry for her getting back tenfold what she gave out.      As the Bible says ... you reap whatever you sow.|`|msUIsv8maa	Thanks for the Heads up i hope they screw  all night|`|CyVxolNHaa	YAY!!! i am sooo a Shick fan, i love love love Nick and Sharon together, and i sooo agree totally on what Jewels said, Phyllis is to be blamed for what happened to Nick and Sharon in the beginning, maybe not totally, cos i believe that Nick is to be blamed too, but Phyllis was NO saint in this, she was a conniving wench that wasted NO time in trying to scheme her way into Nick's pants, and she showed no mercy in doing so either, so i believe Karma's a B***ch for Phyllis huh??      You reap what u sow, {U go Jewels}|`|vO9fPCm2aa	I like Jus Jaz's idea, use and lose em'! LOL wouldn't that be a twist in the Nick/Sharon/Phyllis's/Brad storyline. The problem is they have feeling for each other, feelings are messy. If they do make love while Noah is in the hospital, well we all deal with stress different. Look at it as their celebrating life since he's going to make it. :~)|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	Thanx for the info!|`|LO3BMobRaa	Once again, I don't know how to thank you, you've got the spice that just makes starve for spoilers. I am a bottomless pit for your spoilers. I'm a Shick fan and damn proud of it. i love classic Y&R, and Shick is one of the original couples. Even though Shick have been through a lot and came from two completely different worlds, that is the stuff that made Y&R. Couples like these do not exist anymore, their marriage was built on shaky ground, but they became as solid as a rock. I can't wait for them to make love, and i'll be envying Sharon wishing it was me (LOL) while the Ugly Red Mist is at home as cluless as the day she came out of her mom and the doctor smacked her on the butt.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I'm not proud of anything between this threesome !     I'm ashamed at how they can even THINK about doing the dirty-deed while their son is laying in the hospital ! Shame on the writers' and their insensitive feelings for us viewers !     I'm to the point that I don't care who's with who between these three ! JUST pick a mate and stay there.     Karma....very hard to hide from |`|lSeH9NgHaa	Phyllis deserves better and so does Sharon. Nick needs to get his heart broke!|`|arjB50zBaa	ha ha (laughing at Vegas2La)    I so dont want them back together. I have seen Nick fight so many times for Sharon,Noah and Cassie.  I invested time into this too,lol!   I want to see him fight for his family with Phylis and Summer, I want some payback,lol!  Thanks for the Spoiler but I think I seen this coming.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't understand the writers of the Young and the Restless, I really don't.  I cannot stand Sharon for the simple fact that she acts just like Phyliss portrays her, a poor little Sharon needing Nick all the time. I can't for the life of me understand why Nick can't seem to stay with one person and quit going back in forth between these two. I am totally sick of Nick and Sharon. They absolutely make me want to puke.  Sharon did stop the kiss but now she is writing a therapy letter to Nick, give me a break.

I have listened to most of their other songs and never heard anything like it.    Sometimes when I have my ipod on shuffle and it gets to that song, the intro part of it makes me think of Pearl Jam's song "Daughter".  I know the bands aren't really alike but the acoustic intro to both songs sounds somewhat similar.

BCu8rER4aa	oh,oh,..  so hard to choose,..!|`|RJZQsBqbaa	ARE YOU KIDDING ME?|`|IxGa7mnGaa	Titanic will always be better|`|Hrgp1oC5aa	Um...Titanic. That made  $700,000,000 more than the other crap film did.     You also don't see Twilight up for any Oscars now do you.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Which movie is better: Shite or Puke? Puke or Shite?    Hmmmm a toughie!|`|qesIBFcHaa	Being in my twenties and loving both movies, I have to go with Titanic. Its based off the history of the actual Titanic tragedy, and it was fictional in the aspect of Rose and Jack, but it was heart breaking. Twilight, I loved the books, its a great story of a fiction vampire and family of vampires. And the love between the two is more teenage, despite the fact that Edward Cullen is 108 years old in Twilight, but is like a teenager by his looks, but it makes you all lovey dovey inside (I know I was making noises on how cute they were, a lot of "awweeesss".)    Even tho the two are comparable, they are not the same. Movie wise, Titanic, book wise, Twilight.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	omg i cant make a decision bc i love both of the movies!!!  but since i loved twilight like a whole bunch then its the best one|`|uKSsXz2iaa	This can't be serious! Titanic, no contest|`|fYj3F5qNaa	twilight|`|EolWBaNfaa	titanic was better because of all the details but I LOVE TWILIGHT SO MUCH MORE THAN TITANIC!!!!!    ROBERT PATTINSON IS MY LIFE AHH HES GORGEOUS!|`|PC12QYoDaa	uh, Titanic! Don't get me wrong I do love Twilight, but compared to Titanic there's really no competition. Titanic was one of biggest budgeted movies, and Twilight can't beat what they did with that film.|`|BtKTJwTnaa	They are two completely different types of filmes you can't ask a question like that....Twighlight is better for twighlight and titanic for titanic|`|KXUsmiSdaa	Twilight-it has a happy ending.  and I didnt like her performance in Titanic much.I still love the film but ive read the Twilight saga books and I'm in love with them.  I prefer watching films that don't leave me too depressed.Plus,I've watched Twilight more times than Titanic.  and I dont exactly believe that the budget makes the whole film so a film should not be considered by the budget but the whole package :)|`|GGUDvicaaa	Titanic is flawed but it has gorgeous sets, costumes, lightning and music (including My heart will go on).  I have not seen Twilight, because the story and images seem to be so bland, albeit harmless.|`|uIacUkRvaa	Titanic, it's not sh**|`|sdl6i8SXaa	Both great movies, but I have to say Twilight, I'm a teenage girl:)|`|ZvA10P1Haa	Titanic. The twilight book was good, but they all were TERRIBLE actors!|`|iQAGeVjsaa	Why would you even put those to films in the same sentence. Titanic was nominated and won Oscars!! What do you think is the better movie on a logical level?|`|kfHT6v4maa	TITANIC  WHAT IDIOT WOULD SAY TWILIGHT IS BETTER  IM 15 AND I HATE TWILIGHT|`|gUuSmAZwaa	Their both awesome but Titanic had better acting in it don't get me wrong Twilight was good but it will never be as good as Titanic|`|lpeHQj3aaa	Neither.|`|MrSQC5Kxaa	TITANIC. The Twilight books were good, but the movie was a joke. No contest, Titanic was incredible and Twilight was lame.|`|BPN8zY2yaa	I heard Twilight was the crappiest movie ever, even coming from die-hard Twilight book fans. Hearing that "rave review", I never saw it.    But even if I had, the obvious choice is TITANIC!!!
AA11570236	The other sports already established.They won't and don't want change.|`|kIblsxJQaa	So where did you get the rugby bug?  Americans are only just getting into football and that's for nancy's it should be about another 100 years before they would even consider a real man's sport like rugby.  Rugby is not about violence, its just about getting stuck in and being strong and being a real man.  I am a welsh girl (Wales - winners of Grand Slam and Six Nations 2008) brought up on it  Bring it on  - 14th February against England !!! lol|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	Because it came from another country lol. Jk i dontknow.|`|O3SN4vx1aa	because americans like to make rules in all their sports prohibiting violence|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Its not a sport that started in the US.|`|h7uHcpBhaa	i know right  i love it too  i wish it was popular here, but they use football instead here|`|S9bEtVCSaa	There are a lot of college Rugby "clubs." They aren't teams because of some sort of liability issues - injuries & such. But we had a rugby club at my college. One of my good friends was in the club - poor kid looked like his momma beat him daily.|`|I08iONdaaa	because we have football.|`|BffRKFryaa	they like the poncey version with all the padding and helmets, they  cant take a good ruck.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	As mouse111 has obviously never seen a rugby match, he doesn't seem qualified to comment. It is a minority sport even in most countries where it is played professionally.     I suspect that if it was played in schools it would become more popular. Go along to your local high school and offer to coach the local Football team as a method of improving their fitness.|`|dxVpLM38aa	its for wusses|`|VA3tGarQaa	rugby is brilliant!! going to see the ireland v france match.|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	Could be our cultural way in society.    d|`|XmD61yBpaa	coz they're in love with us football|`|Kp46I3W4aa	WHO KNOWS WHY?|`|I0g24Jmkaa	football is american rugby.|`|kYYDOJzSaa	It's gay.|`|GMTjTF8Zaa	B-cuz we have football.....|`|Mfe6r2khaa	rugby is pointless just like music|`|qvdZIMlwaa	i love that sport!! idk y it's not popular|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	cos you have american football which is a girls version, you know with all that padding so they dont hurt themselves|`|3Eixj6Syaa	I don't know... Maybe most Americans just don't like watching burly British blokes diving around in mud.|`|a6138e092d07f6d19d5c478c75935469aa	Americans are simply not man enough to play it. they play pathetic american football and wear enough body armour to stop an elephant lol. Whats with the ****** helmets hahahaha|`|0psCy0XXaa	Because the don't get to wear all that protection such as helmets and shoulder pads.  Tuffen up americans it won't kill you|`|9NX7rx8Yaa	Because theyd rather clone it and call it their own :p|`|mjb51CYWaa	We have real football, what the hell do we need rugby for?|`|ZO8tWC6aaa	idk it should be|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	Because this is AMERICA and we only like MANLY sports, like when two grown men dress up in skin tight leotards and grab each other in a contest to get the other man to the floor.    MANLY MEN DOING MANLY ACTIVITIES|`|sKogsJYoaa	It's too similar to American football.|`|837xgMwLaa	It's very popular - they changed the name to American Football! :P|`|Sx9VSwRMaa	becuase we don't grow up with it, it's not part of our culture and history.  like cricket or soccer.|`|a6YQviyjaa	Because, quite frankly, americans think football is better!!    No offense however, I love rugby myself.|`|xGit7kvgaa	They like american football not rugby|`|764cf8bcce5b69aa33ca2c53123cdf3daa	You never know, I grew up in the 60's and when I went to school I remember a gym teacher saying someday soccer would be popular in the US and we all laughed and thought he was crazy.|`|jBdZvaf8aa	because its too similar to american football and they may be forced to realise that what they play isnt football.|`|nbxpd5UXaa	Good man yourself!!! (That's NI speak!) lol  I LOVE playing rugby! Maybe that's because I'm from Northern Ireland...  I suppose there are more popular sports (i.e. baseball, soccer, american football...) in America.    Keep playing! :)    btw, to all those people saying rugby isn't a man sport, you should see football  (I mean, soccer) over here. Someone kicks his shin by accident and he's in the middle of the pitch crying. In rugby someone's rubbed his boot (with extremely sharp studs) in his face, and is pouring with blood, he just sticks a plaster over it and goes on playing.   Rugby=MAN SPORT :P|`|4IDgCFWdaa	Its rarely televised in the U.S.   So not many Americans are given the opportunity to get into it.   But if something as boring as baseball is popular here... I would think rugby would catch on?|`|B1GjfOUdaa	You should come and live in a country that can play rugby.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Because the Yanks can't handle it|`|YZxc3SnSaa	Full body contact without armour

I too have not come across anyone that liked Ulrika ... let alone voted for her !!!$%^&    No wonder subsequently many are saying that it was all FIXED  .... and that the producers wanted their money's worth because she commanded the highest fee     I personally wanted Coolio to win .... despite his 'antics' I thought he was genuinely funny and provided a lot of the entertainment on the show, without him it would have been very boring .... What the hell Ulrika was supposed to have contributed .... I don't know !

It's all a load of bollocks.|`|WNNqvaYWaa	i dont really believe those things|`|wogjc0Adaa	Yes, because the position of the stars on the day that two individuals are born really has a bearing on whether or not their relationship will work out.    That was sarcasm by the way.      Just as a side note, I'm a virgo and my boyfriends a pisces and it will be our 2 years on February 18th.  More proof that astronomy is bullshit|`|I4uIOp1maa	i think any star signs can go together as long as u rli want it to work  i dnt think it rli matters
X45rxI7gaa	Because it would've revealed that Naruto's father was the 4th Hokage and if he took his name which would increase the chances of the kids finding out that he has the nine-tailed fox's spirit inside him. So as a precaution they had to distance Naruto from the events as much as possible.|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	Because if he didn't have his mother's name he (and everyone that watches/reads Naruto) would have probably figured out Yondaime was his father long ago.|`|Ds0PJ4RZaa	idk i dont even no that was his moms name|`|2ogFk4Amaa	I have no idea, that is a good question!|`|UkJuQ38Eaa	What I think....is that if he had the last name Namikaze the village people would probably say some stupid stuff like Look at the 4th's son hes so bad I can't believe him...(probably at the beggining of the anime/manga)    But now I think Naruto should take up his last name insted of Uzumaki.|`|fH5n6dw4aa	why not? nothing wrong with that. don't know what century you're living in. i know someone that has their mother's name.|`|0DWB0sc6aa	i have no idea|`|qerFZWTfaa	The whole back story on Naruto is so weird. Since his father was a Hokage, you think he would have been treated with more respect growing up due to what was sacrificed for Konoha. But instead, he became an outsider. Way to go villagers.    I would say that the reason they used his mother's name in the story was for plot development only.

gPE0wRTGaa	Go to summer camp. It lasts a lot longer, like a week compared to like 5 hours, and you'll get to meet a ton of great, new people and make a lot more memories than you would if you just had a big pool party. At camp, you can do a lot of different things, whereas pool parties are somewhat limited in what you can do--swim, talk, eat and stuff like that. Other people will probably have parties, so you can go party then, AND go to camp.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	pool party|`|6of3tqHhaa	Well it depends what kind of summer camp it is, I like tennis and swimming so if there was a camp for that I would rather go to that.

Thats the truth. ;)|`|zWeFBiPxaa	5 or 6 monday is my lazy day|`|Z0CwQf4Haa	Atleast 5 times a week.

(Sunday, Wednesday, Friday.....maaaaaaaybe Saturday)|`|G7LIwt5Caa	7, once each day of the week.  I only shower twice each day if it's hot like in the summer.|`|YsH4NjUhaa	7 to 9 or more.  I like showers|`|AA10741077	at least once a day, twice if I have a workout or something strenuous.    probably around 11 or 12|`|HCqJixZmaa	7 or more.|`|dGpj4WOIaa	monday tusday wensday thursday friday [sometimes] lOl and staurday and sunday.|`|dK6QvcbIaa	Everyday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rVKf4hiPaa	About 8 times.|`|ux8zeXPIaa	5 or 6.    7 most of the time.|`|725ea66750f1947495c36a5b2630a286aa	usually 7. sometimes 6 or 8|`|f07b0125c4dab6bf0705d6e12fbe0cabaa	Once.

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	This was explained in season 1.    Their father abandoned the family when their mother was pregnant with Michael.  She divorced him and went back to her maiden name, Scofield.  That's the name she gave Micheal.  Lincoln has their father's last name.|`|suTfAyBCaa	lincoln uses this fathers name  and his father left when lincolns mother was pregnent  so when michael was born there father wasnt around so he took this mothers name|`|Q8zClAoUaa	Michael took on his mother's surname.  His mother's surname was Scofield.  I'm not 100% sure why exactly they have different surnames but I'm assuming it's to do with his mother's surname being Scofield.
kuwhzixpaa	You have a very nice voice. Remember that resonance comes from the head (or at least, it feels like it does. It comes from lifting the soft palate) and not the vocal chords. You seem to be pushing a little too hard. Try supporting with the abdominal muscles and lifting the soft palate! I'd recommend studying with a private vocal instructor, because you certainly have something to work with!  Additionally, embellishments may be fun to do, but they don't as sound as good as they feel. So it's usually better to keep pitch consistent!|`|4BKmxPcPaa	WOW...THAT WAS AWESOME. YOUR VERY TALENTED AND BLESSED WITH A GIFT FOR SINGING.

ESfmC9xOaa	My favorite is Melissa! She is so sweet and caring, she and Jason also seem to have a good connection. My second favorite is Naomi, she is just gorgeous! She is also sweet. Then, my third favorite is Jillian, she is genuine and very nice. I don't like Stephanie, she seems way to mature for Jason and is like his mother. I don't like Molly either, she just seems fake. I don't know who will win, but I'm hoping it's Melissa, I think the final 3 will be Melissa, Molly, and Jillian because in the preview they all go to New Zeland and that's where the 3 Fantasy dates are.|`|AA12390047	I like Naomi, but she looks so sad.  Jillian is pretty but I think my fave is Melissa.  She and Jason seem to get along well.

Perhaps he himself prevents you. That is a disguised form of love.  Sri Chinmoy    I think you should be careful about what you "hate". Could be you're revealing something about yourself you might not like.       "Indifference is the strongest force in the universe. It makes everything it touches meaningless. Love and hate don't stand a chance against it."  Joan Vinge    I, on the other hand, am indifferent to boy bands and banal teen singers.|`|eywxi2HPaa	I hate them all!!

But the worsted storm, was an ice storm in Ocean City about 5 years ago. The weight of the ice pulled down power lines and ripped limbs off trees .

3862H0WVaa	well that depends on what music you like.  What you like singing along to and how good you are at playing the guitar.  I suggest going into your local music shop and looking for simple cord books by your favorite bands.

YATv97Paaa	I dont think they are lying to you...Its probably just genetics, maybe you have an ancestor who was white...it happens. I have 2 friends who   are sisters and they both have green eyes and none of their parents do, but their great grandmother had green eyes, so they inherited from her...    I also know a friend who is white and her brother is black...so no biggie. And in my case Im white but my cousins are dark-skinned (that doesnt mean we are not related and we truly dont look related)    Maybe you can do some kind of research about your ancestors or something (I think that will help you out)|`|sX5GrKTAaa	the only way to find out is DNA|`|Vjh0mbZaaa	dude yo moms a ho,   thats all i have to say shes probably done every ethnicity if you know what im sayin.   but yea good luck with that|`|dh3l99QXaa	yes you could be theirs and i don't think they are lying and if they are it just means they love you no matter what And the most important thing  is not to look at the color of the skin but to just treasure each moment you have with each other  is the color or race of a person more important to you or is love?|`|qcFt8Mi2aa	You never know. There allot of people that they parents come from different nationality. I think it's ok, is the Love they have that counts.   I understand you. Maybe look for similarities Between you and your parents. Example: the eyes, mouth, face, hair, personality etc. It has to be something in common.   If not, well maybe you are just a mix kid. Or maybe you are adopted. I  f you really are...why does it matter...well, I hope your parents are doing they job correctly. Parenthood is not easy either.      hmmm. let's see. My mom was born in the USA and her father was born in Puerto Rico, her brothers and sisters all born and live in USA. My dad was born in Puerto Rico, his child hood was on the island, as a adult he lived in the USA. His parents are Puertoricans. ME. born in USA, childhood to present in Puerto Rico.....Well, i can say i'm just latin!    Well, Good luck!  =]|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Genetics is a funny old dog, no?

QAwwmDuDaa	When i was younger it was like every night i had a fight of some kind,i didn't go looking for trouble but it certainly came looking for me.Some fights i won and some i lost,i think it's just a thing young lads do.It's like a rite of passage or something.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Not for many years.

I have several friends from India, two of whom are in arranged marriages. One is a man, the other a woman and I knew them both before the 'arrangements'.    My female friend's (we'll call her J) family cut a deal with her since she was so dedicated to her career. She had until the age of 27 to find a 'love match' . If there were no viable canidadtes by that age her parents would take things in hand.     Well J hadn't found anyone by the time she was 27 and dutifully went on dates her parents set up for her. J says there are specific restaurants in New Delhi where couples commonly go on these dates.     J vetoed 6 or 7 guys, finding them "boring and uninteresting". She met Mr. Right on one of these arranged dates and put him through his paces before finally (1 year later) approving him.     They are married now and she tells me they are very happy. She says if they had not become friends there is no way she could have fallen in love with him, but they did and she did.     J is not some illiterate village girl with no voice of her own. She has quite a strong personality and a career as a chemist.     She explained to me  this sort of thing will work only if there is a good relationship between parents and child. The parents know their son/daughter and should have some insight into what might be a compatible personality.     J tells me things can go very wrong when parents want to marry their child to someone whose family is well connected or wealthy and the son or daughter will not speak up. This is, of course, is a terrible situation.            J and I also tallked about the 50% divorce rate in the western world, where everyone picks their own spouse.     In the case of my male friend, a playboy from Tamil Nadu in sourthern India, his parents were looking for a prestigious match. He knew this and after exchanging a few e-mails with them rejected the girls whose pictures and bios his parents sent.     He started sending jokes to them and really clicked with the one who responded with a sense of humor. They are now married and living in the city where I live. I've been able to observe them over a period of time and I can see they are really happy with each other.     I don't present these examples to say arranged marriage is a guarantee of happiness, only to say I have seen with my own eyes that it can work.     Thisis ot somethng I could do. But if I were born and raised in a culture where this is the norm there would be nothing strange or alien about it.

RfXX4yudaa	I was super freaking nervous for my test, but I went into it knowing I could re-take it if I had to, and just be cautious. You won't get marked down for taking your time when turning and changing lanes. Don't worry, get a good night's rest, and good luck!|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Caution:  Always look over your right shoulder before making a lane change into the right lane,(in other words: don't just use the mirrors) They will look for this.(or else U will fail!  based on this alone)  Remember: 25miles  on street with a school.  Watch for tricks that only the instructor nows about.  It could be sign that says:  Do not enter> No Left turns on red> & MPH signs.    Good Luck,  Its natural to be so nervous, but with your experience, you'll do fine|`|C2sZREuAaa	Don't worry.  I got my drivers license at 22 years old.    I failed it at 17.    I prayed the second time around.   It calmed me down to know that the Lord was with me.|`|RGC2aDf2aa	honey I have nothing to say, but I pray for you...|`|lkPYYLiKaa	i was surprised at how easy it was. you will do fine|`|elECfJ52aa	keep checking your mirrors  stop behind the stop signs  and no yelling obscenity's out the window|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	Be Brave ...

You mess up when your freaking out =D|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Hope you pass. If you don't take the hands on test, they go over the exact route.|`|XmD61yBpaa	dont chew gum  look him in the eye  speak clearly  dont swear  show him your breasts|`|qpln6o9Yaa	Get a goods night sleep, eat a healthy breakfast and just relax. I simply followed the tester instructions and tuned everything else out. Passed with no problem. I drove like I was totally alone in the car. Good luck and happy driving!!!|`|AcSFv0IAaa	Don't rush. Seriously, when there is a stop sign, stop, wait til the people in the car have settled, look both ways, go. DON'T speed, even by a mile over! Turn signals!!!!!! If you miss even one, they hit you hard! (not literally haha).|`|0s0LvCvcaa	the best thing to do is just relax and do what they ask you but treat it as if you are just out on a casual drive don't think or worry about the fact that this is ur drivers test. you can always re take it|`|a7dcebdc7ba8f45ffecdc40d7bd7766faa	Put the pedal to the metal and go for it!!

Other than that he's just another rapper. As a person I dunno he seems okay from what i've seen on interviews, but know this!  The one and only reason why he is so successful is because of Dr. Dre. Dr Dre is a musical mastermind and is he heart of every single 50 cent song ever made. same thing with eminem. you know that mary j blige song "a family affair" ever wonder why the beat is so cool but all her other songs are complete garbage? its because Dr. Dre made that song.|`|xnjLpph9aa	if i cant - really worths it

Unfortunately I don't like any of her other stuff which is a real shame because she has a friggin' AWESOME voice.    If you meant the other kind of artist....myself!  I'm into taking pics and sometimes they come out really good.  I'm slowly replacing most of the prints in my house with blown up pics that I've taken.
WtjbCSnSaa	I'm Sorry...As of now, I have researched all of my resources/catalogs/DJ's and can't find the song lyrics "I'll Let You In" By Mike Pinto.  Great song but I don't believe they will be online for another 2-3 weeks.
6p50zivoaa	my fav song by them is never 2 late.i heard it on the radio and liked it alot.|`|b6jt2eOtaa	The first one I heard was Home because when i bought a PSP it came with a disc with like music and game previews and that song was on it. After that I just started listening to their other songs as well.

Y0w2Pk5kaa	Black, brings out their skin tone and goes good with.. I'm guessing black hair|`|XaFYUMRSaa	black/grey|`|c3tADklmaa	I'm Asian and I like dark coats. White coats are for girls, I never saw a guy wear that.|`|mXFOru11aa	what are you talking about|`|AA11700517	I've seen numerous Asians with a White coat and it actually looks good on them.|`|uABvcvw2aa	Ignore the racists,  Dudes in my school swoon over Asians.  Anyways, white coats look good against your black (and perfect and silky) hair.  IMO, black doesn't show off their usually gorgeous hair.|`|RFcbLXh3aa	Um, I think they look good in any color, it just depends on the coat and weather they are light skinned or tan.|`|JpjSGtCnaa	Wrong question, should say Would I.  Each individual will look different, and it has nothing to do with their race.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	What difference does the colour of somebodys skin make to what they wear? they have the right to wear what they want, so leave them!
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	a white "doctor" coat is always attractive...
oFv3v9Oeaa	White coat if we're playing doctor only...otherwise always go grey or black.|`|1l04qpOKaa	White would get dirty really quick or look dirtier.

Q9Ule4Exaa	Rap? I don't know much about it... but off the top of my head:    Rap originated in the gutter, people with something to say found a way to make their situation known. By the end of the 80s, Grandmaster Flash, NWA and Public Enemy (for example) had put forthright political views into the mainstream. This is never a popular position, and as hiphop's musical styles became adapted into pop through the 90s, it devolved into "Bitches, Hos and Bling", becoming much more mainstream and superficial. It lost it's roots and culture and became cut off from it's origins. This is similar to what happened to rock music during the 1980s. By the early 1990s rock had become pop and was superficial nonsense about the "rock and roll lifestyle", swimming pools and easy girls. Ring any bells?|`|0sw9nrcpaa	its become less meaningfull and more mainstream. and certain groups have gone from great underground stuff to drivvle and money making crap now|`|6CAsx3jaaa	rap  used to be about bragging how good you were. titles like king of rock, sucka mcs, for example. or introducing yourself  like ice ice baby , my name is, etc. now its more about sex and relationships or partying.  some rock has incorporated rap but for the most part rock has continued to diversify.  i think both are following the same pattern . they start narrow in type and continue to broaden|`|SFai2Eb9aa	eghehsdhh|`|xyMkhfWYaa	mainstream radio and mtv music has declined as a whole, regardless of genre, but you can always find good new music of any kind if you just look for it a little bit|`|OpBFc27iaa	every genre has gone down since the 90's..alot of people would day 90's music was the best ever...i kinda agree, but there are alot of new upcoming underground and a few mainstream that are really good.    the meaningfull lyrics is one things that has deff. gone down in rock and rap/hiphop...both genres have artist that are lazy and dont really give it there all, you can tell that they arent trying.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Hip hop in the 90s had many different things going on. Gangsta rap, which has now been given such a bad name, was coming to us in the form of NWA and it was as strong a political statement at the time as anything from PE. Then you had your outright political acts like PE and Paris.   The Native Tongues Posse gave us more laid back, jazz-driven sounds - most notable from A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. So-called conscious rap was huge too.   Then there was the mafioso story telling rap coming from NY from acts like Wu Tang, Nas, Biggie and Jay Z.   I paid almost no attention to the underground hip hop scene until this decade, because in the 90s, the artists I wanted to listen to were right there in the mainstream and the innovation was constant.     As far as rock goes, although I'm more into hip hop, the 90s for me were about Pearl Jam, RHCP, PJ Harvey, RATM, etc.     There are still some good mainstream hip hop and rock acts, but not nearly as many as there used to be. Things have definitely changed.     Greed is a big part of it. We're living in an instant society where want want everything now. Making money fast any way you can is applauded.     Clearchannel haven't helped. Their monopoly on American radio (which is a major influence on what the rest of the world listens to) has created a kind of choke hold where any artist who's seen as different won't get a fair shot. Record labels are less wiling to take a risk on an artist Clearchannel won't put on heavy rotation.     There's also the fact that people are spoiling their kids more, which has created the tween market. More and more music is being aimed at 8-14 year olds because they seem to be the ones who'll spend (via their parents) the most money - not only on CDs, but on merchandise.    I think the social and political issues of the past 10 years or so have contributed too. The major social and political issues of the 90s had a direct impact on very few of us, so were were happy to lend our support by listening to music about it.   Now, things are right on the doorstep of many in the western world and when that happens, people want escapism. It's easy to care from a distance, but when the bad stuff starts happening to you, you just want to escape from it - and that often means listening to catchy tunes.|`|W7dO6uoJaa	idk|`|XoYHF1RLaa	F*ck Soulja Boy!|`|hrjRq0Sjaa	stfu|`|p2E60yBSaa	I'd say music in the 90's and especially before then, just had a lot more feeling to it. Today pop and rap seems pathetically simplistic and stereotypical or about superficial, unimportant subjects.|`|RMVvU6Vcaa	rap used to have depth, real issues, pain and happiness. Some still do, but the majority now doesn't make sense abdicate is un-relatable. People like the beat and get hooked even though the song has no true meaning. Which is what music should be about. lil'wayne' soldierboi , and so many others are known to me as garbage and bubble gum rappers|`|AA11098866	A lot of the changes in rock seem to depict more inner emotion.  Take Evanescence, Seether, and Flyleaf for example.  Two of which started off as Christian rock bands.  Even Disturbed, Korn, and Linkin Park seem to be tapping into what is going on with people in everyday life.  With all due respect, I have always felt rap was ridiculous.  The real rap.  It just all seems vulgar and unnecessary.|`|bWDi964Maa	I will only give you my view points on hip-hop and rap, since I am new in rock (Listens to Nickleback, Pendulum, and Linking Park).     In the so called 90s, there wasn't much influence of the technology called Autotune, and the rappers wouldn't have that much of beef in between them. Hip-hop was basically used for entertainment, when a couple of friends get together and just chill. But now, hip-hop is like an industry, a business that is spreading relatively fast. Many rappers today are using autotune in their songs, and I am not trying to be rude here, many un-skilled rappers are now taking over. Less respect for Women is now common, real rhyming skills are less appreciated, and loud bass beats are more on the show.     Here is a comparison between today's rap and 90s rap, read the lyrics and decide yourself:    "It ain't hard to tell" by Nas from the album Illmatic (1994):    It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail  The mic is contacted, I attract clientele  My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath  I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps  Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond  Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin  Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion  Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin  Cause in my physical, I can express through song  Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong  I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell  From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell       "Ms. Officer" by Lil Wayne (2007, I think).    (Yeahh)... Doin a buck in the latest drop  I got stopped by a lady cop  Ha Ha... she got me thinking I can date a cop  Ha Ha... cause her uniform pants are so tight  She read me my rights  She put me in nah car, she cut off all the lights  She said I had the right to remain silent  Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren  Talkin' bout...  Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),  Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),  Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),  And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss  And she know I can hide a-bove the law  And she know I'm raw, she know it from the street  And all she want me to do is **** the police  Talkin' bout...  Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee,  Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),  Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee... (Yea),|`|jBxoy6Pbaa	As for rock, it started with a lot of punk rock in the early 90's with green day, nirvana, and blink 182 which has transitioned to pop-punk of today. Titties

BJm2pQSoaa	Jazz was a cultural movement, and it is accurate to say that it originated from integration. Jazz is inspired from and founded upon African American music. Work songs. Spirituals. The blues. Drum circles, Conga Square, etc. African American musicians did not have a written music tradition. They learned and played by ear. They commonly played together as a sacred social experience, because unfortunately at the time music was the only form of expression they were allowed. So, you had musicians stretching animal hide over barrels, drumming on common household items such as pots, pans, tailpipes, and cowbells, clapping their hands, and singing. If they were lucky, a musician might have been able to obtain a guitar, banjo, piano, violin, etc. Conga Square in New Orleans is a good example of a place where black people were allowed to gather and play their music. In the South (especially in New Orleans) at the turn of the century, there were classically trained musicians, with a written music tradition, playing standard classical works of Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, etc. Some of these musicians were black, some Creole, some white, but the important thing is that a handful of classical musicians were listening to the music of African Americans, and appreciating and respecting it. They began to notate what they were hearing, and discovered musical elements that had evolved aurally over time, but were distinctly audible in the black music of the time. One of these elements was the use of 'bent' notes, which were commonly the third, fifth, and seventh. Picture a gospel soloist singing Amazing Grace; the musicians would vocally 'bend' some of the notes up and down. Some might even do so with a growl or raspy hum. This is common to hear nowadays, but not found to such an extent in any other North American musical style of the time. So when America saw the formation of jazz, it saw white musicians and black musicians working together, respecting each other's musical roots, and having a good time. The music that they were playing together involved heavy use of minor thirds, fifths, and sevenths. These are often called the 'blue notes.' And, when played, these notes would be 'scooped' by a trumpet or saxophone or trombone, to simulate to vocal scooping, or sliding, from one note to another.  The piano and bass would typically accompany (comp) the horn section with modulating chords that they would both play at the same time. And improvisation was huge. A song was just as much spontaneous improvisation as it was written composition. Jazz music was built from equal parts European classical music and African American music. They literally, over a couple decades, fused together. It is a true American testament of cooperation, compassion, and cultural respect. This was the beginning, the creation of jazz, and over the next century, countless other musical styles began to be applied to this music, including Afro-Cuban, Brazillian, and other Latin American musical styles in the late forties, fifties, and sixties. Funk was added about a decade later, and even now styles like hip-hop, techno, Indian raga, and Jewish klezmer music are finding their way into jazz.|`|MoKUZuQraa	Jazz is a way that people express themselves. The musicians of jazz do it through improvisation. It came about when the slaves brought there music with them to America and Louis Armstrong was the first person to make jazz popular in America.|`|0f0787dc56665a4dff2f8ce6033c5254aa	To quote Louis Armstrong when asked your first question: "If you don't know what it is, don't mess with it".|`|stD322SIaa	Without quoting a huge paragraph from a web site you can find just as easily, jazz is a style of music that is characterized by improvisation. It came primarily from African Americans, but it has roots in other forms of European music as well.

I love her voice!  - Sunday kind of love  - What a Difference a Day Makes  - Sentimental Journey    Nat King Cole, a classic!

In the halls of Valhalla, where the brave may live forever." -- The 13th Warrior    "The War. The humans, I think, knew they were doomed. Where another race would surrender to despair, the humans fought back with greater strength. They made the Minbari fight for every inch of space. In my life, I have never seen anything like it; They would weep, they would pray, they would say goodbye to their loved ones, and then throw themselves without fear or hesitation at the very face of death itself, never surrendering. No one who saw them fighting against the inevitable could help but be moved to tears by their courage. Their stubborn nobility. When they ran out of ships, they used guns, when they ran out guns they used knives and sticks and bare hands. They were magnificent. I only hope that when it is my time, I may die with half as much dignity as I saw in their eyes in the end. They did this for two years they never ran out of courage but in the end, they ran out of time." -- Londo Mollari / Babylon 5: In the Beginning    "Are we on? This is... this is the President. I have just been informed that the midrange military bases at Beta Durani and Proxima 3 have fallen to the Minbari advance. We have lost contact with Io and must presume they have fallen to an advance force. Intelligence believes the Minbari intend to bypass Mars and hit Earth directly. They say the attack could come at any time. We have... we have continued to broadcast our surrender and a plea for mercy. They have not responded. We can only conclude that we stand at the twilight of the human race. To buy time for more evacuation transports to leave Earth, we ask for the support of every ship capable of fighting to take part in a last defense of our home world. We will not lie to you: survival is not a possibility. Those who enter the battle will never come back. But for every ten minutes we can delay the enemy advance, several hundred more civilians may be able to escape to neutral territory. Though Earth may fall, the human race must have a chance to continue elsewhere. No greater sacrifice has ever been asked of a people. But I ask you now to step forward one last time, one last battle to hold the line against the night. God go with you all.

BKrqlGz4aa	Gotta love the "cut & paste" answers from Wikipedia ... if you like tainted facts and lazy people.    There are actually 3 versions of the OT ( Original Trilogy) ... the originals that came out in 77, 80, & 83 ... the SE versions that came out in 1997 ... and the DVD versions that came out in 2004.  The reasons given by Lucas for doing this are very logical even if some of the changes he made aren't.    When the movies were first made all of the FX used was "seat of the pants" figure it out as you go.  Most of the stuff worked fine but some of the stuff was subpar but worked so they went with it because there wasn't any other way to do the stuff at the time and not enough time to figure out a different way to do it.  Case in point:  The scene with Jabba and Han in ep IV, the name of which is A New Hope NOT Star Wars,  the scene was shot with some fat guy playing Jabba but ended up being cut out of the movie because Lucas didn't want Jabba to be a human and he had no clue as to how to do it the way he wanted to.  In the SE & DVD versions he could use the new CGI techniques that ILM had come up with to make the scene the way he wanted to in the beginning but couldn't.  The same can be said for most of the other changes that he made and the biggest changes he made were to improve the sound and picture quality of the movies.  The SE versions were discarded and the DVD versions made because they tied the story together better with the prequel movies.  In truth most of the changes DID improve the movies ... there are only two of them that send real fans into a tirade ... they are the "who shot first" thing between Han & Greedo in ep IV and the "Ghost Switch" at the end of ep VI.  The "who shot first" thing can be chalked up to PC bull because Lucas didn't want Han to look like a cold blooded killer although it was plain to see that he was only acting in self defense when he shot Greedo.  The "Ghost Switch" ... that one can't be explained away even by Lucas himself.  He says he switched the face of Old Anakin with the actor that played Anakin in the prequels to tie the two trilogies together by having a familiar face for Anakin ... that might have been ok but then he said that it was also done because a Jedi's "Force Ghost" is that of them when they died and that Anakin died when he became Darth Vader.  That reason is pure BS and Lucas knows it but he isn't very good at admitting to mistakes.  Even the data banks at starwars.com don't agree with his reason ... when you look up Anakin's bio there it says that he died in his son's arms in a dockingbay aboard Death Star II ... you'd think the idiot would check his own data banks before sticking his foot down his throat but that's the "genius" of the man.    No, this question isn't "heaven" for true fans like myself ... it is a way to try and explain things to people who don't know the story behind the story but the sarcastic tone makes it obvious that you don't really care about the answer and just want to take a shot at the Star Wars saga and the fans but be that as it may ... those are the reasons for it.     The original originals were put out on DVD in 2006 at the request of the fans so in the end Lucas isn't quite the @ss that he makes himself seem to be.  When they first came out they were marketed two ways.  The first was a two disc set with the original version and the DVD version together for all 3 movies.  The other way was with the original version and one of the prequel movies IE:  original version of ep IV and ep I ... original version of ep V and ep II ... etc.  About a year after that they were put out as single discs.  If you really want to find them all you have to do is look for the words "Original Theatrical Version" from 77, 80, & 83.  They really aren't too hard to find.    The SE versions were only released in VHS format and will never be put out in a DVD format.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	The quick answer is that George Lucas wasn't quite satisfied with how the original trilogy (Star Wars, Empire, Jedi) turned out.  There were some obvious issues with special effects, like the one you mentioned with Luke's landspeeder.  There was originally a smear on the film to hide the support beams holding it up, but with the use of CG it's been cleaned up in the Special Editions.  There were also things that Lucas wanted to show, but couldn't either due to lack of time or because the technology just wasn't there yet.  Also, there were things that Lucas added or changed to make links between the original trilogy and the prequel movies (such as digitally putting Hayden Christensen in as Anakin's Force ghost at the end of Jedi).    You can get the original versions in a box set that also includes the special editions of the movies (see links).    EDIT - for Jedi Dude:  Read the Wikis and and my answer more carefully, and you'll see I'm not doing a cut & paste job.  The Wiki and starwars.com links are just there so the asker can check my facts and know I'm not making the whole thing up.  Thumbs-down back at you, and stick that saber where the sun don't shine!    Obviously there's more to the story than I put in my answer, but I never **claimed** to be giving a thorough one.  A brief answer referring the asker to where he can get more info should suffice.  YA isn't a very good format for writing a master's thesis, anyway. :-)

95uw0KJfaa	in the new episode, they took the kids to see the new house. the kids ran free, and were soo excited! kate spent 4 hours cleaning the mold and mildew out of the refrigerator (not including the freezer part of it!). kate also included cara in choosing the color of her and mady's room, b/c cara didnt want to move. suprisingly to kate, cara and mady agreed on the color (a nice blue). also, mady and cara like their room b/c they have their own staircase to it!     the little girls room(s) are going to be the same pink that mady and cara's current room is (at the old house), but a shade lighter. leah and alexis are going to share a room (since they both get up early) and hannah is going to get her own room since she sleeps later. also, the 3 little boys are going to share a room which is going to be painted a nice tan that kate chose.    for lunch, they let the kids have pizza, as a treat. after lunch (or maybe before, i forget) jon took the kids outside to run around and they ran and then went to the barn, which was filled with horse poop, and then to this shed, which had a dead rat or mouse in it, which all the kids were fantisied with, and they all wanted to touch it and kiss it but jon wouldnt let them!     oh and another funny thing that happened was that first joel was pooping (in the girls bathroom which he got in trouble for) and kate had to search all of the house for him (and then aaden was pooping too) and that made kate realize how big the house was when she realized that she had to search for a long time too find the kids to wipe em.     oohh and also jon and kate brought them into the master bedroom (their room) and told the kids to have one good look, b/c they would never be allowed back in there again! lol        so thats basically what happened, and you could watch the episode either on tv on tlc, on tlc.com under jon and kate plus 8, on itunes (if you buy it), or on youtube (but you said you dont want to)      *love jon and kate plus 8 and cant wait till monday to see them actually move into the new house!!|`|uDsXjzwjaa	They took the kids to see their new house.    It's on a large lot of land with a barn and the house is huge. Mady and Cara are still sharing a room but it's on a different level of the house, Hannah is getting her own room because she has migraines and needs quiet when she sleeps, Alexis and Leah are sharing a room, and the boys are sharing a room. Jon and Kate's room is really big and nice too and new rule in the new house is no kids allowed in their room. They made a big deal about this! In the episode it showed Jon & Kate showing the kids all of the rooms and telling them their room situations (that I just explained above) and the rest of the show was Kate cleaning out the kitchen. It took her 4 hours to clean the refrigerator! Just the fridge side!! Jon also took the kids outside to see the barn. It was a good episode and I loved seeing the inside of the house. They didn't show the outside of the house but someone else on Yahoo! Answers found this link...it's insanely huge!!!!    http://s424.photobucket.com/albums/pp329...

An old fat man should marry her. Ellen Degeneres is married to a lesbian, but since the marriage is going to be null and void, she can marry a man if she wants to. She probably won't, though.|`|mYxvDgVxaa	Ellen is funny and she seems like an awesome person. Tyras funny but she's crazy so I'd say Ellen.|`|AA10962298	Ellen, because then I'd get to nail Portia De'Rossi, too.
kl1kzlzXaa	Perhaps your personality is not as attractive as your face? Hard to tell without knowing you...|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Maybe your personality doesn't suit them.    OR     Are you having sex with them too early?|`|cyRDKRIDaa	Obviously because you are lacking of a good personality.|`|GLDXjJfaaa	becasue you are a free spirit and must travel with the wind lol|`|PBdZLwp3aa	im a sagottarius female and i have no problems with men..    hm. must be you.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	I have met many Sag females, and they are very attractive, cute and desireable. The problem is, these guys you are meeting are very very attracted to you -- but for the wrong reason.  They want one thing and one thing only. It has nothing to do with you. You draw them in, and you have the ability to keep them as well. They're just wanting to do things and then dump you. Make sure you don't "give" until he's given you a full commitment, otherwise you will continue to be disappointed.     It isn't you. It's them. Find a better quality of guy, and hold out for him and him only.|`|VovEvH8Faa	Sagittarian women are quite charming to the opposite sex, but if the guys don't find any depth behind your flirty exterior, they're not going to be inclined to stick around.  Especially if the guys in question are water or air signs.  Another thing that is quite common for Sagittarian women is that they'll have a few guys pursuing them at the same time.  This could be why they're getting put off.  If they think they're one of many, they may think they have no chance and simply give up.    On the other hand, if your Venus is in a water sign, that will counteract the Sagittarian behavior and possibly make you try too hard.  Do you fall in love easily?  If so, you might be smothering the guys or coming on too strong.  You know better than any of us how you act around these guys.  Think it over yourself to see if you can pinpoint where you're going wrong.  The next time a guy falls for you and you like him too, let him know he's special and maybe reign in the flirting with other guys.  Not to be insulting, but since this happens often to you, I'd say the problem is with you and not them.  But it may be something as simple as a signal you're inadvertently giving off.|`|iJRcdSbiaa	They say we're too blunt and men are often dumb-founded by us.  Who really knows.  If these men were truly worthy, they'd still be in your life.  It's not you, it's them.  You're fabulous!  Keep being your naturally upbeat, and optimistic self.

pNUtnoC8aa	Yes I am an avid deer hunter in the Appalachian mountains. I have hunted squirrel with a 4-10, and a 22, squirrel gravy is really good with deer tenderloin.

I really doubt God appreciates people doing so, animals are his creation and children as well!    *I would never hurt an animal for food either (I'm a vegan), but there is a difference to me between people that do it for "fun" (sickos) and that do it for food*|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	I generally hunt only what I like eating. The exception being coyotes and coyodogs.  Yes I like deer hunting, squirrel hunting, turkey hunting, quail hunting, dove hunting, duck hunting, and wild hog hunting.  Coon no don't hunt them, but like watching them.   Coyotes and coyodogs no so much hunting as killing varmints with them.  Don't have bear where I live so don't hunt them. What few we have are protected as well.     You do not hunt bob cats on my land or panthers{cougars} period as long as they are not killing live stock or chickens.  Mainly because bob cats keep the rabbits, field mice, and field rats cleaned out. Along with snakes.  Panthers because they keep the sick deer cleaned out which keeps us from getting like West Texas at one time where their deer got so over populated they were all stunted and not fit to eat.  And the big reason is they also help with our wild hog problem.|`|AA11570236	I would like to.I live in So Cali.Harder to do here.|`|mggll8dRaa	Never Been Hunting, and Never will....!!

qkmsixWXaa	Well in my opinion horoscopes can say some true things about people, but all people are different. For instance, there are 2 scorpio people but they are completely different so they can't really have the same interests right? I think it depends on the person, regardless of zodiac sign. You may have to figure out your own connection with the other person.|`|cyRDKRIDaa	Well, I can answer, but I'm a pisces girl. : D     I've found that earlier on in the relationship, the tricky little games that my scorpio used to play with me kept me amused, and I liked the thrill of the chase, always out to keep him, keeping an eye on him, etc. But eventually, the games got old and I was tired of playing cat and mouse with him. The games weren't just me chasing after him, it eventually started to include jealousy, sex, and a lot deep conversations.    Scorpio's are hard for me to handle personally.|`|WJ5lGNxxaa	Scorpio and Pisces go along very well together. I think this relationship will be long lasting and very passionate. You share a lot of common interests.

6vzpHTqQaa	Mad TV was better about three or four years ago; at that time, SNL was producing crappy show after crappy show.    For the last two years, SNL has blown Mad TV out of the water.  Memorable digital shorts and sketches that are repeated by everybody the next day have brought SNL's popularity back to the top.    It also helps that Tina Fey revitalized SNL through her portrayal of Sarah Palin.    Also, since Mad TV won't be on FOX after this year, I would say that SNL wins the head-to-head battle.|`|aihogb26aa	I have to go with the original...SNL. They have better guests and recurring characters and always find a way to stay relevant and make news (ex. tina fey's impression of sarah palin, the way that obama, palin, hillary and mccain all made an appearance this year).|`|rabjcdjHaa	I always liked Mad TV more!|`|zU4hTv3Kaa	SNL is more orignal butt mad tv is worth a chuckle or two|`|BJoojnQCaa	I think both have gone down hill lately. But SNL is still much better then Mad TV. After the original cast all left on Mad TV it never was the same.     Also Lazy Sunday is still one of the funniest things I have seen. I still crack up every time I watch it.
srtoPxN2aa	Hey HS, I really enjoyed that...thanks for posting!   I had an album by them back in the mid-late 80's, though I can't recall the title. It's probably packed away in a box somewhere. I do remember the album that I owned had a song on it called 'Crash Landing', and it kicked some serious butt. I don't recognize the song in your video though...  I loved the raw, unpolished sound of the band, unlike so many of the other over-produced hair metal acts of the 80's.  Detroit has given us so many fantastic bands over the years...Great stuff!|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	Hey! Thanks for sharing!  I found this cool and entertaining.

As for the guys , they are too different in personality to be friends in real life (characters that is) so why would they be on the show.

Classic Bay Area. that whole album is sick.|`|dgzBfrpZaa	they sample teddy pendergrass - love TKO  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV9VuPkII...    but i think the piano in the beginning was just added by the producer|`|okECVBkzaa	Good question. I'll listen to it tonight and see if I can figure it out. That RBL album is classic to me.
pVTevFJgaa	Actually, I'd prefer if you had chosen Master of Puppets as a debut. But anyways...    I think that they would be sort of popular in the Metal scene, but they will have the statut, of, say, Opeth. Very popular in Metal, but not heard of non-metal people... or at least not as popular as real Metallica.    They become popular because they were different and innovators in the music of these times, but now there are many similar bands... They would be popular, but not the most popular band.    EDIT: And yes, I know too that Kill 'Em All was their debut album!|`|LuK19ZFPaa	AND JUSTICE FOR ALL ISNT THEIR DEBUT ALBUM    god whats happened to people|`|KEk728Gsaa	Good question!!!    I hate to say it but they would probably wouldn't be too successful. It really seems like the genre "metalcore" has taken over metal, and other decent genres are looked down on by mainstream listeners. It's a damn shame.    As we all know, the success of all Metallica's newer albums are only because there older stuff was so great.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I'm not sure...i think that possibly they wouldn't go down too well with the general population =[  But i would like to think that they would...  ...And Justice For All is an awesomeee album! I would most definitley be in with the people appreciating it =D|`|dduWesM5aa	no, they'd definetly be underground, these days people don't listen to music anymore, they've moved on to that noise called rap. even though i don't really like metallica too much.    Michael....I think metalcore is just a easier genre to listen to especially for noobs to the genre. the band that made me fall in love with metal was As I lay Dying, and i'll love them till the day i die, but then i slowly moved on to Melodic Death metal, Death Metal, Hardcore, Progressive metal, and eventually Deathcore, which has become my favorite genre.|`|GrI8mCJyaa	With all the specific issues with this scenario aside, if AJFA was their debut, they would be greatly accepted as newcomers to look out for by the overall metal community.  But they would not be a hit or popular in the mainstream, more-so in the underground (which most metal is anyway) because Thrash is not popular as far as 'mainstream metal' goes.  Which direction they took after that would decide their fate though, if they went chronologically backwards in the releases of the real Metallica, they would survive, if they went onward from AJFA they wouldn't last (which in reality, they shouldn't have lasted, but that's just me).|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Well I know I'd go nuts for Em. As for the gen pop, I'm not so sure.    And Kill Em All was their Debut. Please don't kill Me, I was just pointing it out. The first Dude shouldn't have capslocked it tho..

I'm gonna go with the best sitcom ever...Seinfeld.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	the Original series of beverly hills 90210 with the cast from the first series because i thought it was a great show and the remake can't match it.  it would be good to do it now because you be able to see what happened to them all and where they are now. even just a one off reunion episode would be good|`|jesjtp87aa	Boy Meets World or King of Queens, i know they are still on but I would like to see new episodes|`|MZPuDifYaa	Malcom in the Middle was hilarious.|`|AA10531094	Surface. . . I think there was so much truth in it.  Maybe that's why they pulled it.|`|fNdKyJGeaa	Everybody Loves Raymond was the Funny as hell.|`|aihogb26aa	Friends (ended in 2004 so it just makes the cut!).  The characters felt like a family and the show addressed real topics and obstacles in life with a  gentle, realistic touch. They didn't have to rely only on slapstick or one-liners (although they definitely had some of that), but they also had the realistic relationships between the characters and it made you really care for them.|`|HYyt0cE9aa	Alias- it was just good.|`|uDsXjzwjaa	The Gilmore Girls! Because that is the ONLY show that I could watch over and over again. Plus, the finale didn't really sum up everything and it left a lot of things up to the viewers' imagination. I just love that show and they definitely could have kept going.|`|fwZPEqwMaa	All that, Hey Arnold, Doug-Nick  So weird- Disney|`|xxSGhywoaa	Carnivale it was classic!

(That doesn't stop some people though)|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Both.|`|xUKLUSL5aa	you can vote and fight in a war but you arent as experienced at life as an over 21 adult. but basically you are a young adult. one more year and you wont be a TEEN to your friends.|`|mMi19s7Vaa	well you can do things with out your parents so that makes u a adult =]    but your still a teen till you turn 20    bec Nine(Teen)|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Your an inbetweener.|`|FSyaAnuKaa	Technically, you're a teenager and an adult.|`|72444e08c9e33c48ded58d8e6c28c267aa	Youre still a teenager technically... but at 19 i hope u are starting to develop the mindset of an adult...

For example inside I'm still 5 years old!|`|2FsNdcXEaa	I've wondered that too...I say both, who says a teenager can't be an adult? Adult is designated at 18, but being a child or a toddler isn't like, you are a toddler from ages 2-4, a child from ages 5-12, etc. It's different for everyone where the age cut offs are.|`|oMBdvEtiaa	You are an legal adult once you've turned 18.|`|AA11522290	No matter what you think                                               Facts:    Baby= age 0-5  Kid/child= age 6-12  Teen= age 13 - 19  Adult= age 20 - 64  Senior= age 65 - 121  Record age= 122|`|TRUgtW8oaa	adulteen|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	right now you are a combination both a young adult and a teenager.

According to everyone else, you are a teen.   I got aggravated because of that too. That was until i turned 20!  Don't worry about it so much though...the time will go faster than you think.|`|8OVEjPg1aa	I see being an adult as about being mature enough to take on responsibilities and make your own important decisions, not just reaching an age. I am 19 also and I would say I am an adult.     Just because the age is nineTEEN doesn't mean you are a teen. It is just the number, like being runner number 19 in a race. Or being the nineteenth person to do something.|`|c3QxWOUVaa	You're a young adult! but once you hit 21 you are a fully an adult.

b5xPKpPpaa	you're not racist, you just like a certain kind of guy.    it's no different than if you only liked guys with brown hair or that are tall, etc.    of course, you should like the person for who they are. but again, it's no different than only liking people that aren't fat or something.    everyone has their own personal preferences.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I think yes ..|`|0sw9nrcpaa	lolz no... but white guys are great so dont mess!!|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Umm....

It is, however, in my belief, a sin, because SOMEWHERE in the Bible it says for people to only (make) love (to) their own race or something.|`|gdip2jWfaa	No, you're attracted to them, you don't hate them.

He said that it most likely won't be on iTunes because they don't own the rights, but they're considering putting it on his website or myspace.

l3ukjXK0aa	I was born in the US however I'm half black and half white. So I have caramel colored skin (as you can see) and I often get discriminated against as if I do not belong in this country.    Keep your chin up.....when it comes down to it....EVERYONE in this country is an immigrant and no one is better than you are....we're equal no matter what anyone says|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Well, I'm American, but every day I see people being treated differently because of their race and it's terrible.  People from every race can be equally intelligent or beautiful and no race is superior.  Americans need to stop judging by appearance and start judging more by personality, because in general, we are a very shallow country.|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	well im white and i feel discriminated every time i go by popeyes|`|aPnjb8JGaa	I'm American, but I was born here.  I may look white, but I actually am part Middle Eastern (Syrian to be exact).  I think racist white Americans need to grow up and quit hating on people for their looks.  Afterall, most of us have heritages that come from a different country, even if that person has always lived in America.|`|72444e08c9e33c48ded58d8e6c28c267aa	My avatar is self explanatory : )~    Open a history book... its not completely changed...|`|TEnvIAjraa	I don't feel like I'm being judged.. but I live in a pretty diverse place    but many times people underestimate me, it's always nice to prove them wrong =]|`|4YdbC6ekaa	There is a terrible misconception about white people.  Sure there are some that are racist but I see racism in every race.  I for one am sick and tired of being stereotyped as a racist because I'm white.  It's unfair and unjust.    To answer your question, yes!  It unfortunate but I think everyone for one reason or another gets judged just because of the way they look.    Don't think for a minute that this only happens in America.  I've been all over the world and I can tell you first hand it happens in every country I've ever been to.

It's a wonder she's smiling so much.)|`|AcWx41gQaa	Ichimaru Gin is my pick for the best bleach character. Plainly, you can see everyone potentials and limitations, but gin is still the black sheep. You already see the overpowered abilities of certain cast members such as the hero, Ichigo, who in both releases increases his personal characteristics such as speed, power, agility etc. While people like kenpachi is limited due to his animistic instincts. gin is still unknown and his past with Matsumoto has yet to be revealed (if ever) and i just think he's just perfect as the guy you see in the old black and white films where a guy with a mustache kidnaps a girl and ties her to the train tracks. He's just, evil yet full of confidence (not over confidence like Aizen) and he's just plain aloof, laid back and just shrugs and see how things goes.|`|wc7TpbUMaa	Hitsugaya because he is cool and strong. Not to mention his awsome kanpakuto when its in bankai.

cVVvHNXSaa	Well astrology has a lot to do with our personality. It guides and shows us our weaknesses and where we are at our best. I used to think like that about one being luckier than another but however its not up to luck or chance. Its up to us to figure out how to be better positive people and by using astrology, we can help ourselves by learning about who we are and what's make us unique as individuals. The more we know ourselves - the better the understanding of others, nature etc.    I hope this is what you were looking for and I do hope you understand.    Capricorn Sun Sign here.|`|Utkdzgfgaa	Depends on how you look on it, when I started reading about zodiac and my sign and all those natal chart stuff, it was really interesting I must say, and it was amazingly accurate!

But i honestly hate reality dating shows.. OBV. its never going to work out! lol Who would want a relationship with someone they cant see for 3-6 months?? lol|`|lSeH9NgHaa	Does it really matter. Is there ANYONE that has stayed together with they picked anyway?|`|aOfq8Pgeaa	People might see them with the person they picked.|`|0i9y6Jk1aa	Since the show is recorded in advance to when it airs on tv, they can't see the person they choose so that the conclusion of the show stays a secret, and then after the finale airs they can be with them. At least I think that's what you were asking?|`|EsTRlfpkaa	I'm not sure.    I think it adds to the suspense.

dpYMlxA4aa	No body of any note today is writing music in the style of Vivaldi, but there are many great modern composers and pieces to look into    Harrison Birtwistle:  Pulse Shadows, Five distances, C.A.M.P., Orpheus    Luciano Berio:  Sinfonia, Sequinza's    Brian Ferneyhough,  Second String Quartet, Cassandra's Dream Song    Stockhausen,  Zyklus, Helicpoter quartet, Kontact    George Crumb,  Black Angels, Vox Balenea    Fred Rzewski,  The people united, Les Moutons des Panurge    Thomas Ades,  Asyla, Powder her Face    Kurtag,  Kafka Fragments    Eliott Carter,  Asko Concerto, String quartets    Bruno Maderna,  Serenata  2, Aura  Ligeti,  Venetian Games, Lontano    Iannis Xenakis,  Persephassa, Tetras, Metastasis    Charles Wourinen,  Arabia Felix, Speculum Speculae    Other composers in general to look for  Steven Stucky, Lachenman, Gubaidulina, Kaija Saariaho, Olga Neuwirth, Serge Provost, Tristan Murail, Gerard Grisey, John Cage, Earl Brown, Scelsi, Nicholas Maw, Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros    That should get you started.|`|jbAr62ybaa	If you like Vivaldi, you might like Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings" - but be forewarned, it's extremely sad music:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=1dPDO3Tfab...

Bear Mc Creary    Allegro : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdrgxg5r...    Passacaglia : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSYPYq9D_... - this piece is slow but in almost exactly the same form that Vivaldi often produced. This technical form is rarely produced these days.    The Shape of Things To Come : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU...    The Prelude to War - While MANY structural elements - particularly the use of percussion and the use of discordant wind-music in the same piece as an overlay might not be present, the pacing, heavy reliance upon the violin and structure would be a good comparison.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv4UqrWV2...
