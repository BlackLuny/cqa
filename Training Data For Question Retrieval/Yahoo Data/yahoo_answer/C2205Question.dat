I just finished the game, i know it came out a while ago, but i got tired of it telling me my brand new game was dirty every other time it tried to load a level. Overall i was somewhat disappointed. It seemed so short, i started it on Friday and was done Sunday. During the last cutscene i kept expecting something to happen that would give me another 4-5 levels at least, but nothing. Anyways, my question is pertaining to the storyline. After Chief and the Arbiter blew the ring that takes car of the flood, but what happens to the hundreds of thousands of covenant on earth? Do they just give up because truth was killed or what? I don't think that was really explained.

Me and my guild are attempting Sarth with 3 drakes (10 man) and I would like to know what everyone's opinion is. I am a melee dps pulling around 2.8-3.3k in our previous attempts last night. I was the lowest dps in the raid, so we clearly can do it. The question I have is this... Is it enough? We manage to successfuly get the first drake down... but consistantly fail when the 3rd drake lands. Yes i knwo this is due to his debuff and how he makes the tank look like charmin when we wipe but we keep getting that far. Is still more dps required? ( our dps ranges from me at the bottom end, to around 4.2k at the top end of the dps spectrum).

As far as I understand the origonal Pikmin from GameCube has been re-released on the wii, with a little graphics touch up and some new fangled stick pointing controls.      Do you think the new controls are worth me shelling out the ￡15 difference between the Gamecube and Wii versions?      Or would it better to grab a (for me) new adventure in Pikmin 2? I heard it was an improvement over the already brilliant first game?

20090223115230AAzeeUF	Games & Recreation;Other - Games & Recreation	Sims 2 help please respond fast.!?!?	Okay so I have the Sims2, Sims 2 Seasons, Sims 2 Pets, and Sims 2 Apartment Life. I had Sims 2 and Sims 2 Apartment Life installed and I wanted to install my Sims 2 Pets because I was getting tired of Sims 2 Apartment Life. So I uninstalled Sims 2 Apartment Life, and when I went to install the Sims 2 Pets, everything went smoothly. But when I went to play it, it says, "I am running the wrong version of the Sims 2. Please run T version instead." or sometimes it says the ". version." Okay so I got to uninstall the expansion packs, and when I went to uninstall  The Sims 2, it says I must uninstall all the expansion packs first. So I went to Add/Remove programs and the only Sims I had on there was my Sims 2. So I clicked Remove it, and It said the same thing that I must uninstall the expansions. So I erased all of the folders, everything that involved the Sims. So I went to run it to see if I still had it, and I still had it and it said the same exact thing.!! I am here in a minute going to download the Sims 2 Bonvoyage, which is where I just download it off a website and pay with my credit card, I don't know if it will or won't work, I just think it will because it don't involve a disk.   Please help?   Many thanks,   Alesi

I think so.      Some reasons:      Ability to sprint (using the same button)   2 different red dot scopes resembling COD 4   Left trigger zoom   X to reload   Not quite sure on this one, but I believe both jump with A?       The general movement feels like COD 4, ofcourse the store, textures, enemies etc... aren't the same.      Regardless, when playing the fear 2 demo, it felt exactly like playing a substandard COD, the only breath of fresh air I felt was when I got into the mech suit.

Ive caught exactly 100 pokemon, and when i see the elite fours molitic, drapion and (spiritbomb?) then my pokedex will be completed. ALL MY POKEMON ARE LEVEL 53. The names in brackets are their nicknames. i havn't got much time so ill leave out the natures, which i know are pretty good anyway. Please leave a rating and possibly a suggestion. thanks!      First up- Infernape (Blaze) Moves- flame wheel, grass knot, rock slide, mach punch. Pokeball- pokeball      Next- Staraptor (Swift) Moves- wing attack, brave bird, fly, close combat. Pokeball- Premier ball.      Now one of my favourites- Gyrados (Hydro) Moves- ice fang, dragon dance, surf, waterfall. Pokeball- Net ball.      Then- Mismagius (Mystic) Moves- psywave (saving up for thunderbolt to replace this) magical leaf, shadow ball, psybeam. Pokeball- Nest ball.      Now another of my favourites- Garchomp (Platinum) Moves- crunch, swords dance, dragon claw, earthquake. Pokeball- Dusk ball.      And finally- Roserade (uh... roserade) Moves- giga drain, magical leaf, solarbeam, sludge bomb.      well thats it. Im sorry for the excessive grass attacks in this team, but i find them very useful. all level 53. oh and can anyone suggest a good nickname for roserade? Just not petal plz. something more original than that! =)

Hey guys before you continue reading I don't care if you hate wow, or if wow stole your life or what ever. I just want to know about my question that's all. not how bad wow is for your health and Blar blar.      With that out of the way i'll begin my question. I've been playing wow for 2.5 years. I have a level 73 rogue and a 71 shaman and I quit playing about 5 months ago because I wanted to get a better social life.      Well now I have that social life and even a girl friend. The thing is i'm considering going back to wow.       My questions are:      If I were to start playing again, would my social life suffer?   If I were to start playing again, which charr should I play?   If I were to start playing again, would It even be worth it?      I really don't know if I should or shouldn't. I'd just love to be running around pwning people again but I'm not sure if I want to put the time and effort into it. Please help me
