This week I found out I would lose my job unless I buy a 6000 dollar video camera.  My car had an oil leak and the garage, Canadian Tire, put a metal object with washers streched around it in my oil pan instead of a plug and ruined the pan which the dealership now says I have to pay 500 dollars to replace.  The condo board called me and said I have till tomorow to removed the leaked oil from the parking spot or they will hire the most expensive service to have it removed and forward me the bill.  So I cleaned it on my hands and knees while fighting off a gastric flu. I looked on my way out and the stain is still there so I'll have to re-do it tomorow morning. It makes the whole experience of driving all over the city trying to find a solution to a parasite infestation in my fish tank and putting my back out carrying the products in and cleaning it on Monday almost amusing.|`|6TlrDFdyaa	that sounds like the stages of depression. Don't be worried, it may not be. I get these moods ALL THE TIME, every day continuously. When you get like this, go somewhere quiet, lay down, listen to some music and relax. Try to take a nap.

6IXrgxqSaa	Hey, we could just print more money if that was the true reason behind the global economic crisis. Our leaders are already doing bailout money plans but they have given us zero results so far. Even the "leaders" of our countries sense that old tactics won't work but they are running out of options. The interesting thing is that the leaders of our countries around the world including bankers, economists, and other such high profile figures begin to say more and more that the reason for the crisis is a distrust between people. Yet they have no global solution for the problem.<br>  <br>  The global crisis we are experiencing in economy, as well as education, science, disease, breakdown of the family unit, threat of war, terror, etc. is caused by humanity's egoistic relations between one another. Man is willing to exploit anyone at the cost of his personal gain. Our own egoism (inner intention to self benefit with no concern for others) is bringing us all the troubles/suffering in our lives, and the growing global crisis in the world. Humanity's egoism in the world has now reached a global stage of growth. Globalization is being revealed everyday. We must understand globalization is not about money but it is the revelation that all of humanity is interconnected and dependent of one another like cells in a body. And for a body or a unit to operate optimally it has to follow the law of altruism. There are examples of this throughout nature except with man. <br>  <br>  This means all parts of the body work to benefit the whole of the body. That's how it maintains balance and stays healthy. Just like the way it works in the body you are in now. In humanity's case the cells are individual people and humanity is the whole of the body. Imagine if the cells and the organs in your body behaved towards each other the way people behave in relation to one another. Sounds like some type of disease such as cancer.<br>  <br>  Until humanity understands the true reason behind the crisis and implements an education/method on how to thrive in the global integral world we now live in, the crisis will continue to grow in many ways. <br>  <br>  Instead we could see the crisis for what it really is, a springboard that unites mankind and brings us to higher and more valuable level of existence. The videos below explain more.

MJijF66Paa	Three things must happen before the economy can recover.<br>  <br>  The first is pretty standard and most important: the the national debt must be liquidated and MAL investments have to be offset. Every country that has ever ran this type of reckless expansionary monetary policy with a fiat currency, or a currency with no intrinsic value, has had recessions. The US has even upped the odds with its GDP largely based on consumer spending (US GDP = 70% consumer spending) and an increasing trade deficit to accompany it; our economic footing is accumulating debt from bought imported products. An economy must be able to produce wealth to be solvent.<br>  <br>  Given this, recessions are necessary because, in all the circumstances, debt has to be liquidated and to also offset all MAL investments.<br>  <br>  The second and third are centered around the first but will be good indications to the end of the downturn. That is interest funding rates set by the Federal Reserve must dramatically increase to entail inflation and the Bond Bubble must pop. <br>  <br>  It's also important to note that even after these factors find equilibrium though, the US economy won't automatically go back to its original form. The reason we're in this mess in the first place is because we've been living beyond our means, hence the debt and excess.|`|tVoMXFDRaa	2010|`|GHd84xipaa	i wouldn't hold your breath.if any thing it could take 3 or more years to get out of this one.|`|Ny5FYSvEaa	The recession will end when growth becomes positive.

There are plenty of very negative people who go on to live extremely long lives.  There is a very good reason for that.  It is that if a person is focused on the subject of `` not wanting to live a long life``, the basic subject of the thought is `` long life`` and not `` short life``  or the even more productive subject `` death of the body``.  This will attract `` a still longer life``  whether it is wanted or not.  Did you never wonder why there are so many failed suicides?  You probably would answer that by the apparently obvious, that the person did not really want to die and you might be partially correct,  but the real essence of the answer has to do with focus.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds too simplistic but that is just the way our brains are hard-wired.  From another point of view, you would not call up your local furniture store and tell them what you do not want, now would you?

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	The power of human touch has been studied through the ages. We all need human contact and there's nothing like a real heartfelt hug from someone to warm your heart, spirit and make you feel calmer, loved and accepted. It's amazing how much can be "said" without words through a hug. A heartfelt hug can lower your blood pressure, calm anxiety, soothe a broken heart & spirit and lift your mood. Sometimes a hug can even bring one to tears because of the effect it has. Hugs are great and everyone could use a good hug now and then.|`|kBkx2vVGaa	It's being so close to that person that makes you feel safe. A hug makes me feel like whatever bad or good feelings I have is being crossed over to that other person, and we are sharing each other's pain or joy.|`|NDXhxaJ9aa	To be honest, I generally find hugs awkward, but I myself am pretty awkward...<br>  <br>  My guess would be that their appeal is in what they symbolize at both a rational level and an instinctual level. Humans are social animals. As such the acceptance of other humans is something we would crave. A hug is probably one of the greatest gestures of acceptance possible. <br>  <br>  Or when times are bad, a hug can be a sign of support. People tend to feel more comfortable when they know others are there for them. Even if the others cannot help directly.<br>  <br>  I think you will find physical showings of affection are quite common among all social animals though.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	It makes me feel loved and appreciated. A much needed hug can do things that no amount of words can do. Sometimes, a person can lie with words, but with a big, warm, bear hug, you can't really lie with that. I especially love it when the person smells really good that is hugging me, and when they hold on for a while, and not just let go after like 2 seconds.

I will be able to go away on vacation and not worry about having someone for her to stay with. I will be able to cook or not cook each night.  I won't be responsible for making sure that she does what she's supposed to do.  She'll be an adult and I'll be able to hand most of the responsibility to her especially if she goes away to college.

You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn’t even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could.<br>  <br>  Don’t accept it if someone tells you, “that’s not enough to be suicidal about.” There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain.<br>  <br>  When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources.<br>  <br>  You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible.<br>  <br>  Now I want to tell you five things to think about.<br>  <br>  1  <br>  <br>  You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope.<br>  2  <br>  <br>  Give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, “I will wait 24 hours before I do anything.” Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself, doesn’t mean that you have to actually do it right this minute. Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action. Even if it’s just 24 hours. You have already done it for 5 minutes, just by reading this page. You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page. Keep going, and realize that while you still feel suicidal, you are not, at this moment, acting on it. That is very encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you.<br>  3  <br>  <br>  People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you have to be alive to feel it. You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek, if you are dead.<br>  4  <br>  <br>  Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you.<br>  <br>  But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you. Find one of them. Now. Use your 24 hours, or your week, and tell someone what’s going on with you. It is okay to ask for help. Try:<br>  <br>      * Send an anonymous e-mail to The Samaritans<br>      * Call 1-800-SUICIDE in the U.S.<br>      * Teenagers, call Covenant House NineLine, 1-800-999-9999<br>      * Look in the front of your phone book for a crisis line<br>      * Call a psychotherapist<br>      * Carefully choose a friend or a minister or rabbi, someone who is likely to listen <br>  <br>  But don’t give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this alone. Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource you need to regain your balance.<br>  5  <br>  <br>  Suicidal feelings are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to continue caring for yourself. Therapy is a really good idea. So are the various self-help groups available both in your community and on the Internet.<br>  <br>  Well, it’s been a few minutes and you’re still with me. I’m really glad.<br>  <br>  Since you have made it this far, you deserve a reward. I think you should reward yourself by giving yourself a gift. The gift you will give yourself is a coping resource. Remember, back up near the top of the page, I said that the idea is to make sure you have more coping resources than you have pain. So let’s give you another coping resource, or two, or ten...! until they outnumber your sources of pain.<br>  <br>  Now, while this page may have given you some small relief, the best coping resource we can give you is another human being to talk with. If you find someone who wants to listen, and tell them how you are feeling and how you got to this point, you will have increased your coping resources by one. Hopefully the first person you choose won’t be the last. There are a lot of people out there who|`|u7LSohRyaa	It probably feels like you're being killed already. I too have felt such pain a couple times. I finally had to scream it out on my back porch. It's better to go a little crazy for a time then to end your life for all time. Blame it on the grief which makes everyone a little crazy. <br>  <br>  Express it anyway you like just don't hold onto it. The best way to heal from grief is to go right through. Trying to avoid it prolongs it.You will recover from this pain probably a couple years from now and will be glad you didn't really die. This guy won't be as important to you as he once was and it will make you a stronger person.<br>  <br>  I would recommend getting as far away from this guy as possible. Maybe someone can help you with some plane tickets or something. The more time you spend time with this guy, thinking about him, the longer it will take to recover. It is good for you to talk this out with someone that doesn't tell you you're obsessed. It helped me to talk about it until I was tired of talking about it. <br>  <br>  Another thing that helps is considering the suffering of others and also helping them. It sure beats isolating yourself. Thank goodness you still have school to look forward to.The secret service stuff, if it's for real, is definitely a deal breaker. It's worse then being with a military man or sailor man or ship captain or police man, don't you know.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Wow... this is a tough situation.

If I refused, that will mean she had to have a penalty.<br>  <br>  Then, the guys came to her rescue. They started to rip my clothes off, and soon, I was pinned down in my grey briefs. The girl was shy and gingerly massaged my body (more like touching). Then, the girls directed her to sit on my legs and work her way down. When her hands arrived at my waist, the guys rolled me over and a spare pair of hands yanked my underwear off!<br>  <br>  But the ordeal was not over. In my state of desperation, all I heard was laughter and i finally saw my pair of briefs held high in the air by one of my friend, as if it were a trophy; and he was running towards the water as I followed. then, he deliberately flunk it into a crashing wave.<br>  <br>  They all had a good laugh as they saw me surface, clad in my wet pair of underwear. The boys were laughing hard when they pointed at my briefs that seemed to outline my privates.<br>  <br>  If all endings had a happy ending, I had a relationship with one of the girls not long later.

In addition if a government does as you suggest then other nations will demand more money to pay for the goods they sell.|`|lWqOTYvWaa	You are wrong, the government is not paying itself when it pays its debts. Government debt is in the hands of private investors in the form of Treasury Bonds. You could buy Treasury Bonds yourself and be a creditor of the government. When the government then pays off that particular debt (by redeeming your bond), you receive cash for it. <br>  <br>  If that cash you receive was taxed away from someone else, or borrowed from someone else, then there would be no net increase in money supply -- it would just be transferred to you. But if the government "printed" the money to give you, then that increases the money supply in the economy.<br>  <br>  There is a special part of the debt that the government owes itself, like the Social Security Trust Fund. The government could theoretically just cancel that out. Maybe that's what is confusing you. But those funds are a savings asset (as well as a debt) that the gov't has built up for a reason. Totally misguided and stupid but that's another story.|`|7uPXFD5faa	The government hasn't printed money in decades. It is done by the Federal Reserve. <br>  The Federal Reserve is a Quasi department of the government. Regulations are established by the government but the Federal Reserve is a group of privately run banks. <br>  The government must get new money from the Federal Reserve in order to fund spending in excess of the taxes collected from us.<br>  Taxpayers are simply paying to reduce the debt on the money that the government borrowed from the Federal Reserve and to redeem Treasury notes that become due and payable. The Federal Reserve is not a friend to the American people. Don't expect any changes. The people with the money intend to keep it and get yours and mine too.|`|PK49Nodlaa	Money is in circulation for years and the amount in circulation is never accurate because money gets destroyed or taken out of the country. When money is "needed" and printed its purchasing power is lowered in currency exchange. If the dollar's worth is lowered then it costs more to buy things like oil and other imports, therefore the consumer's price rises.

HA8bxrLTaa	Some fetishes I've heard of are feet, hands, pain, human waste, bondage, strangulation... It's not necessarily that you need that one thing or can't get off (for most). It's more the heightened sense that goes along with it makes it feels so much better that one may end up tricking themselves into believing that's the case. It becomes like a habit-forming addiction. One may begin to feel disappointed in their partner or sex life if that fetish isn't employed. Which is probably how that all comes about. The person you're with you can love tremendously, but be bored with in the bedroom if they're not into sharing in your fetish(es). Which then translates into the disappointment factor,etc. etc. I've also heard that it has roots in traumatic or childhood experiences, or the fixations (like oral--difficulty in weaning from bottle, pacifier, nursing).|`|m3ThrbDMaa	When I was about 5 years old, one of my babysitters was this hot 18 year old chick who wore thigh length skirts and shorts all the time, and would put me on her knee where I would be memerized by her gleaming thighs...and so...to this day...<br>  <br>  A woman's thighs are my "squealing with pleasure fetish"...<br>  <br>  (Go figure...)|`|0PvpGjSqaa	most psychologists think that it is a result of a strong emotional or traumatic experience, but could also just be genetics.|`|1y5IxCVyaa	Apprently alot of it stems from childhood experience; when emotionally intense events to you when you are young, you can latch onto symbols associated with that and develop a fixation on them. This can manifest itself as a sexual preference which the person might find a turn on.<br>  <br>  The problem is that some people fixate on one this sole element of sexual pleasure and, often through masturbation, can condition themselves to only become aroused by that one stimulus other than the whole array of sexual fun out there.

People who are saying that it is due to childhood events are reading off the wikipedia article which itself is unclear about what it is taking fetish to mean. The kind of fetish which might be caused by psychological association is taking the word fetish in the traditional sense, becoming obsessed, sexually or not, with an object. For example someone who had a shoe fetish would be obsessed with a shoe, this could be a single shoe or many but it is the object that really counts. However the cause of this type of fetish is not all that clear either.<br>  <br>  What most people mean by fetish these days is simply sexual preference. For example in this sense someone might have a shoe fetish, meaning they like to have sex with a girl who is wearing stilettos. Here it is the girl who is important not the shoe. These types of fetish may be genetic or come from the environment people are not sure. However one thing that is clear is that they do not tend to come from traumatic childhood experiences such as being abused. This is a myth and some people might consider it offensive. This article (Richters et al., 2008) deals only with BDSM rather than fetishes but to be honest the lines between the two are often unclear in any case. Have a look at the first link in this answer to see some extracts from this article.|`|ZsUe1T65aa	Of course there is an emotional draw when you're having sex with someone you love, and that makes it so much better.

ORiXdGzNaa	My mother is a psychiatric and she says that when people put there hands in there face when they are nervous is because they want to get away from there and hide. Some other things people do is that when they want to be alone or are insecure they cross the arms, that's why spokesman always have there are wide open, so they can invite people to listen.

WTH?|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I don't care what your sexual orientation is, if I enjoy your company, you're my friend. My best friend is my husband, but there are different types of 'best friends.'  There are things that I talk about that just don't interest my husband. That's 'ok', but that's what other friends are for. Gay men often have very unique personalities and are very accepting of other people. You don't have the whole competition issue that poisons so many female/female friendships. I lost my best friend who was a woman because her sleezy fiance tried to have sex with me when I was drunk and she was passed out in the other room. (We were young and didn't know our limits.) I did what I thought was the right thing, and told her that he had made a pass at me. She asked him why he had done it, and he said that I had a nicer a** than her. Our friendship was never the same, and she found a reason to stop talking to me. I would never have that problem with a gay man. <br>  <br>  As for a straight man: my husband would be a little bit weirded out if I started spending a lot of time with another straight man. It's ok to have straight male friends, but bad things can happen to the best of us if we're not careful. It's best to not tempt fate.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I'm not a straight woman, so I can't really speak for them, but as a bisexual woman, I do tend to enjoy gay men.  I fetishize them and their sexual exploits, plus feel a similar element of queerness between us.<br>  <br>  So yeah.  For me, personally, I'd love a gay male friend.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I have a couple of close gay friends and they're awesome. Most of the women I know feel the same way about their gay friends.|`|3buQDaRDaa	This is why every straight guy needs a gay man as a wing man. Gay guys reel in the women and then they are there for the taking.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Not especially.  It wouldn't bother me, but I don't attach any great importance to the sexual orientation of my friends.  I mean, that's the whole point of having friends, isn't it, that you don't have to be concerned about their sexuality, because you are just friends?<br>  <br>  It wouldn't bother me if one of my sons was gay, but I don't particularly want them to be.  There's no guarantee that they will stay at home if they are gay, all the gay men that I have known have had their own places.<br>  <br>  In fact the only mature adults I know who live with their parents are heterosexual.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	Pop culture would not have *everyone* believe that *all* women want a gay man as their best friend.<br>  <br>  Don't be absurd.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact gay men and straight women make enormously great buddies if they get on well together because think about it: there is absolutely no competition.<br>  <br>  As a guy I am attracted to gay men. She is attracted to straight men - there can never be any crossover or jealousy in that respect.<br>  <br>  We can't compete re clothes or looks: ergo no jealousy<br>  <br>  My best friends have all been straight women. Well. Not all. My best friends have been women and a couple of straight guys and a couple of gay guys but the easiest and fun-est have been women.<br>  <br>  My best friend (for over twenty years) in my whole life was a straight woman and I remained friends with her when she met the guy who was to become her husband: he split up our friendship. He was threatened.<br>  <br>  Heterosexual men are just as doted on by their mothers as gay men and most emotionally healthy mothers encourage children to be independent when they become adults: it has zilch to do with the sexuality of the child.<br>  <br>  All gay men I have ever known were keen to leave home as soon as possible and never went back.|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	i have had at least 2 gay close friends, and they are fun to be with! they're cool, they're smart, they're pretty much normal and we both like guys.. sometimes though it's really sad because they seem to have more cute boyfriends than me, sucks for me,  happy for them though :)|`|E6OFX15Maa	To be honest, I think it'd be kinda cool.<br>  Having a gay best friend, guy.<br>  Because everytime I get a guy friend, he ends up liking me, and then it's all weird.<br>  With a gay friend that wouldn't happen.<br>  XD|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	I do have a gay man as a best friend.

But then, I wouldn't, because no matter what people say, there's always some sexual tension.|`|F3NNKwP9aa	I never thought about it.I look for interests in common in making friends and it doesn't matter if it's a woman or a gay man as long as the person is healthy both physically and mentally and isn't attracted to me sexually.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	I personally don't care what their sexual preference is.  A friend is someone that you have fun hanging out with, and having a good time.  As long as I enjoy their company that is all that matters.|`|N3ioHJwDaa	No, I really don't.

s0mzHlVZaa	At this age, young people will look for anything to tease or pick on, believe me it won't stop, when you lose weight, they'll find something else to pick on. These people are trying to find a way to build themselves, you'll probably be interested to find that they probably have major faults, maybe even the same fault. It can make you feel bad, because you will believe what these people are saying. You can improve yourself, and become even more impressive as a person, but then you might find you still don't attain the approval you crave, from others, because people always find something else to hold up, as their ideal look, or whatever.|`|CfVaXtyNaa	I have self-esteem issues too. I know you probably heard this but, they really arent your friends if they say that to you. From reading this I can tell that they are super jealous of you, so they are trying to make you feel bad about yourself. Like they dont call a pretty girl pretty, cause they are jealous.<br>  <br>  If you dont think your ugly or fat (your probably not) then your right, who cares what they think. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and your "friends" will get hella bad karma and be the ugly and fat ones, well if they arent already.|`|0PvpGjSqaa	first i would ask you why are you hanging around people that are being cruel to you? do you think you deserve that? how do you start feeling good about yourself? you could start by finding some new friends who have better things to do with their time then putting you down, or if you don't want find a new social circle, empower yourself by telling your friends to shut the fu(k up.|`|7p1Amhofaa	you gotta first think why are they making fun of you in the first place- is it really about you? If they always try to find something to pick on you about, then its probably them who have the issues... they're feeling inadequate, and instead of striving to make their life better, they'll just try to pick on someone else to put them down, so that they can feel more superior... <br>  so you gotta realize this- you seem like a sensitive person, and words really do bite at times... but that shouldn't control who you are- who gives a hoot as to what they say? <br>  and here's something to help you feel good about yourself: <br>  you've got a good heart- and its those with a kind soul who gets hurt easily... and in my books, that's the most important thing...
a1Ngi39Xaa	A good friend of mine has done some mild recreational stuff but when his group of friends got into cocaine, they all fell apart.  He did not get into it or try it at all.  So based on that, I do not recommend it.  He watched their lives disintegrate.|`|2LlC6AWHaa	no, unless you want to go to rehab or go living on the street because you got hooked on drugs|`|NYOvfc4haa	Cocaine will not make you more social. What it will do is make sure you eventually lose all of your friends (not that you will care about friends when you're on cocaine), interfere with your ability to perform daily activities, and eventually kill you.<br>  <br>  You need to learn how do deal with life the hard way: By living it and not running away from it with drugs.<br>  <br>  Now what you referred to in the question was coca tea. I don't think it is a good idea and you should not get into the habit of relying on substances to fix your problems ;) You can do it!|`|BMb30AzAaa	Definitely not.<br>  Keep in mind this isn't coming from someone who is all against drugs. I'm all for natural substances, i sometimes take them myself. You see, Cocaine can have a disgusting effect on people.

qL3dGTXDaa	You are caught between what is right and what is wrong. In otherwards, there is a collapse within your core values. You know it is morally not right to have sex without being married nor truly committed, but you do it anyway. It comes down to almost something spiritual within you.|`|AA10984198	There can be a number of reasons.<br>  <br>  Many people have sex for self-esteem reasons, and while the attraction and flirting process is exciting, after it is all over, we are left with the original feeling. It is often the case with women using sex for this reason, though men as well.<br>  <br>  For men, there is a chemical issue. When men have sex, after great sex we have no energy. This is perhaps so we can fall asleep and women can choose to kill us or run away.<br>  <br>  The depression might be related to this.<br>  <br>  Though I would say I think you need to be looking at your whole life. Many people find themselves attracted to sex, drugs and the party life because when they are by themselves they are sad lonely and depressed.|`|r4N245AOaa	nope.. totally normal... i know i have felt this way when i was with someone that i wasnt in a relationship with.. or it could be that your not mentally ready to have sex..|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Girls that are not comfortable with there bodies and need to walk around will do that other then that I wouldn't know|`|z7FEj9QSaa	It could be from your upbringing.

AA12231462	It is enough to love it so much - join a dancing group with other people who love it too and out yourself you will get lots of help - I did ballroom and latin american and it gives you a sense of rhythm and balance and a bit of confidence as you learn steps as routines and it gives you a bit more confidence when you try to dance freestyle. Eventually it goes in - I went because I am so clumsy I wanted to move gracefully rather than my usual chaotic bumping into everything and it worked to a degree.<br>  <br>  I think its brilliant to love something you are not good at - You can only get better and are always going to be warm to others who dont get it.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Well same with me, I love to sing and dance and I love music. If I could have I would have loved to play the drums or the piano.. but I can't even read notes and I have an absolutely horrid voice and can't carry high notes.. <br>  This should not stop you to love music and to enjoy singing and dancing... dance as if nobody was watching, sing as if nobody was listening and pretend to play an instrument.. sing karaokee...  Dancing is something you can learn if you want to take classes. Singing is something you have to have been born with a special talent.. and you have to put a lot of hard work into this talent which you get at birth.. a musical talent.. is something one needs to have to make music into a career and lots and lots of discipline and hard work. Just the talent alone if it's not furthered, would be going to waste. So those who make it to the top in the music business have to go to train their voice.. have music lessons even if they were born with the talent.. they need to practise.. if they play an instrument.. they may have that talent .. they need to learn to read notes, find pleasure in the dull parts.. until they get to becoming professional at playing an instrument.. <br>  <br>  I dare say if someone like you or me, who were not born with this talent.. if we put all our effort into playing an instrument and into learning to dance.. we could do adequately well to maybe play some piece of music at a party of a friend, and we would not look silly on a dance floor but we could never become professionals, because we just were not born with this talent.. but this does not stop me from enjoying to sing anyhow, even if I don't have the voice for it, and it doesn't stop me from dancing.. it's good exercise and I do it..and I love listening to music.. it's great for the soul.. you should do whatever you want and dance and sing.. just accept that you won't be able to make it into a career.. that doesn't stop you from enjoying and from having fun I hope because it doesn't stop me! xx|`|cNRCN4yKaa	Don't you just hate that guilty feeling. When everyone thinks of you as a perfect girl, but deep inside it is untrue and what you express to others are not really geniune.

AA10911602	You have to pay for things therefore they are scarce - if they were not - in the economic sense - you would be able to get them for free, like air. You use your money for what you need most then for other things. Your income goes up and prices go up you only get what you need - this is opportunity cost.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Scarcity is the quality that makes a good have value.  Opportunity cost is the sacrifice related to obtaining a good.  So, if you buy two hats and have no shoes, the opportunity costs would include the immobility of no shoes,  discomfort of being shoeless,  and the accomplishments you abandoned by having no shoes.  That is the true price of the second hat.  Not just the dollar expenditure.  Without scarcity, there is no economics.

WgqRMfCPaa	After 1980, We saw the emergence of the internet along with other technical advances like Television in India. This has had a profound impact on parenting in India.<br>  <br>  The Meaning of the word "Human values", itself has undergone a transformation. Kids as young as 12 or 15 know about sex and talk about boyfriends.. They would rather go to a rock concert than a temple to pray to god. Parenting has become more challenging in India than ever before.. not to mention the teen pregnancies and abortions. Its a change thats happening and we must embrace it and try to imbibe value to our kids.. Its up to the parents to do that !

Or you're probably just shy to show your feelings to the world. First you should have close friends that you can talk to (ones you can joke freely with) and just talk to them about your personal opinions. You guys would probably start discussing each others feeling on the subject and find out you might have more in common than you thought. And if you really want to discuss something without anyones opinion, if you ask someone to just listen and not give you advice, a real friend won't say anything against you. Also, learn to be an ***. If something bothers you or you notice it;s bothering someone else, just say it. Make it clear what's happening. Most likely someone will thank you for it. (Even though they won't say it to you directly.) Just don't be a HUGE asshole about it and start trying to hurt someones feelings. (Unless they really really deserve it.)
6sJhoXAAaa	Yes we need fun to round out our quality of life.|`|JHWQDWfQaa	of course.
rfU4yqzyaa	I am actually going through somewhat of the same situation. I have came to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to tell her (or in your case him). If you could both consent to some of the things you all talk about I feel that you both owe it to yourselves as well as each other to see if there is something there. Now it can get kinda tricky with the significant other thing, I would just say I have something that I have been thinking about and I don't want this in any way to ruin our friendship but.... I think you will feel better after its off your chest. But to answer your main question I would say yes it does. :)|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Omg wait! You BOTH have significant others?? And yet you persist on entering this DANGEROUS arena of non platonic friendship? That's where you got me annoyed... I thought you were both single and I was like, "How fabulous is this love story...." But, that's not the case. <br>  <br>  I know that people think if you aren't married it's all fair game, but it's not. If you have feelings for this person YOU need to decide if they are real first and foremost. You said that you talked about being intimate if you weren't with anyone. I think that says it all! <br>  <br>  I think you could try to find out if he is willing to break it off with who ever he is with. Are you willing?? If the answer is no on either end, then this relationship moving into intimate isn't worth damaging two other people over. HOWEVER, if you are that attached to each other then it has to be a clean break. The other two people involved here, don't deserve to have their mates fantasizing about someone else and waiting to leave and blind side them... End one before beginning another...|`|XqzH0l0Maa	if you have a significant other than you shouldnt have anyone that you can confide in besides the significant one. if you decide to tell your friend how you feel than that means that you value your potential relationship more than the one you accually have. so your next step would be to end things with your boyfriend cause its not fair for you to lead someone on. your emotionally cheating and im sure that your boyfriend wouldnt approve. you need to choose.|`|lV1wMi5haa	Does not seem you have any special affinity in the relationship for the following reasons.<br>  1. although you admitted it platonic on the first day of your dating, the reason behind seems a desire to indulge in physical relationship but held back by the hesitation of exposing yourself physically to the other on the very day 1.<br>  2. the other promised dos you both committed and shelved for future contacts are platitudes which anybody in the civil society really does  to greet the other who may not even be an acquaintance.<br>  3. so both of you may wait for some time longer without any contact with each other to realise if you both really feel the pinch of being incommunicado and the desire to come closer to each other really arrests your day to day activity.
xACwWEXHaa	I'm not sure there is a limit that we don't impose on ourselves.<br>  <br>  When I was young, I had a "family" of about 200 people I knew by name.  I could touch these people in my mind's embrace whether they were present or not.<br>  <br>  When I got a little older, I had about 200 people in school that I shared classes with at one time or another.  These people were added to my mind's embrace.<br>  <br>  When I started working, I knew about 20 well at work, but probably another 200 business contacts.<br>  <br>  I changed careers to be  a teacher, and each year, I'd have about 150 students plus 50 or so co-workers I knew by name.  The 50 stayed more or less the same, as long as I stayed in the same school district.  Each year, I added new students to my circle of contacts.  100 to 150 students per year over the course of 20 years is 2000 to 3000 students.<br>  <br>  I haven't deleted any of these people intentionally, but I've lost touch with many of them at least in the physical sense.  Since I "semi-retired," my circle of real live contacts has contracted, but my circle of internet contacts has expanded.  <br>  <br>  Theoretically, I have all these individuals in my mind's embrace, and all the categories of people that my real acquaintances now that I can also embrace.  My son joined a soccer team, and I added not only a group of individuals, but all the categories they represent.  Each new experience brings new people to my mind's embrace.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure there is a limit, except that some of us live insular lives, and that mind's embrace is limited to what we know.  Unless we are mentally active, the stretch to embrace those outside actual touch is more than we can handle.<br>  <br>  On that sad note of limitation, one of the things I've watched with regret as Alzheimer's disease claims my mother is how her mind can no longer embrace that which she can not physically touch, and soon, she'll lose that too.<br>  <br>  I can not name a happiest day in my life because they have been so plentiful and each blessed in its own way.  However, one of the saddest in the few profoundly sad I've had was the day my mother "lost me" from her mind's embrace.  It was a temporary moment of confusion, but I know it will become permanent before she is lost to our touch.|`|JdYVmsNaaa	There's always room for one more. :-)<br>  <br>  This song is nothing less than magnificent, and the beautiful answer from Karen Star is its equal. Truly captivating.<br>  <br>  I was caught by the phrase "fragile strength", or, more accurately, I was caught again, because I have pondered it before. Once my ears were tuned, I began to hear that everything is "fragile". Beauty, of course, is fragile. And wealth, no doubt. And ego--Heaven knows. Confidence and courage are fragile. Women are frail. Handle men with care. <br>  <br>  Peace is delicate and Freedom is fleeting. Our Governments can't last. Our very Identities are fragile things. Friendship is fragile. Bodies: fragile. Hearts. Minds. Fragile, fragile. Fragile is all of Civilization and Life. The Universe is "this end up"... everything is fragile. <br>  <br>  It is a reminder to us to take care, to remember that nothing can be taken for granted, nothing is sure. A useful reflection, but I've always sensed more strength in the world-- perhaps the same feeling as gazing at the stars and feeling majesty, not belittlement. Strength, I believe, is always harder to find, but I know it is there. It's the persistent whisper of hope beneath the clamoring bells of caution.  <br>  <br>  The right words are elusive, but "gravity" is as good a place as any to start. There's a force that holds us in place, and reveals our fragility, yet it is also the force which holds us together. Of all mankind has imagined, that's the only power I wish for, the gift of bestowing that absolute certainty. <br>  <br>  I know how many I hold in my mind, yet I don't know if they feel my touch-less embrace. Those who are gone from my life, and those who are gone from the Earth, some who I have never met, I hold them all. None of them should be afraid. They've never left me, and none of them will ever be alone. There is my only atheist prayer: To all I embrace, be certain.|`|wneux5kzaa	Without the link.<br>  <br>  The amount is limitless....<br>  This question has brought tears to my eyes...<br>  so I am not going there......... <br>  right now........

You probably make it out to be a nice relationship cause u really liked her and she obviously had some feelings for u otherwise she wouldnt have been with u.  <br>  <br>  I wouldnt recommend getting back together with her though if u are considering it, although u miss her, you probably just miss having that special someone.  She doesnt deserve you after the way she treated u.|`|PoSgTKfEaa	I would like to answer your question but I have the same problem.
8LhEs3WLaa	Sometimes parents just suck (me included) The only thing that keeps me on the straight and narrow with my kids is that I had a sucky childhood too and I never want my kids to suffer as I did.. First you need to realise that this is not your problem. It is his. Yes I know it hurts you but unfortunately not everyone that can have children should have children. Instead of seeing this as a HUGE negative in your life, turn it around and use it as a positive. How? I hear you ask. Use it to build strength in yourself, be excited that when you are older you will have siblings (you will want to know them when you are older and don't blame them in part for this), and most importantly of all, use it as a tool of what not to do to your kids when you are older. I am not defending your dad but maybe there are issues in his life that you don't know about. Have you spoken to your mum about how you feel? Maybe she isn't prepared to talk about it, but just venting to her (by talking, not shouting) may make her see the hurt you are feeling. this may in turn guide her to see what she can do to help. This may not happen straight away. If you feel your mum is no help, go to someone you know really cares about you. That may be an Aunt or Grandparent or even a school teacher. Through out life there will always be people that will let you down. This experience now, if dealt with properly will help you in the future deal with letdowns a lot easier. You miss your dad but maybe at the moment he is not the best person to be in your life. I believe everything happens for a reason, sometimes it may take us years to understand that reason but eventually you will. Use this to build yourself in a positive way and just maybe when you are an adult you will be able to help a kid going through the same crap. Also make time to see your school counsellor as they will have the knowledge on who can help you deal with these feelings. If you can successfully get through this, one day you will either be able to show your dad that you were better off without him OR make him proud that you got through the crap he dealt you. Either way, you will be the winner. It is amazing how so much hurt can make you a better and stronger person. Good Luck and remember no one can fix your life for you. YOU need to be the one to take the steps to become a successful and happy human being. DO NOT allow yourself to be the victim of his selfishness anymore. Tomorrow is a new day and the first day of the rest of your life.|`|VyRWDv6Jaa	i wish i could help....sounds like he doesn't deserve a daughter like u|`|AXLjSj2qaa	I absolutely dont know what to say but I feel like I can't just NOT say anything. Whenever something bad happens to me, I think to myself; everything happens for a reason and you will be a better person from this experience.. trust me. Here is a quote that to me, is so powerful:<br>  <br>  So do not fear, for I am with you;<br>  do not be dismayed, for I am your God.<br>  I will strengthen you and help you;<br>  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	I am so sorry sweetheart!  I can't think of the kind of thing that would cheer you up, so I'll settle for a few words of sympathy.  <br>  <br>  What your dad did to you was so cruel and selfish.  It's so hard to have a parent who shows love when he is there but can so easily walk away.  Even your mom and other adults may have difficulty understanding how a man can do that!  <br>  <br>  I know that you will continue to miss him and you'll probably be angry with him too.  You will always have the good memories too, and you know, some folks don't ever have even that much.  Hug your mom, your brother and your dog!!  And accept that your father is simply a very imperfect man and that you and your family deserved better.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|0BJWUl5raa	I  feel sorry for you but be practical.

AA12231462	I experience this too I think it is because there is a trigger somewhere in my daily life to put me into this state - Like the news of a child being abused even though I think I am strong now It still affects my emotional self. Sometimes triggers can be really weird and hard to link - Breaking a cup was one of mine and it took me years to fathom it. But it always started a period of  greater sensitivity - It is true let go to the crying and you will get some release if you have a natural block to crying watch a terrible weepy film like love story or beaches.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Maybe you're just stressed or tired. Sometimes I'll forget about something for awhile and then all of a sudden see a commercial or something that reminds me of it. That's usually enough to put me in a very emotional mood for awhile. Also, a lack of exercise can cause you to feel emotional. If you don't get enough excercise it can slow down hormones. Maybe check up with your doctor just to make sure it's not a medical issue that you can't feel yet. I've had kidney infections cause that and didn't know what it was until it actually started to hurt like hell.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	Hi Alma- I think you need a good check up.  I bet they will find that your thyroid or hormones are either too high or too low.  You may be experiencing huge hormone fluctuations. That is easy to test for and easy to fix.  But you need a doctor to diagnose you properly.  Because it has been going on for a few weeks I don't think it will just go away.  Please see a good doctor as soon as you can!<br>  I hope you feel better soon sweetie!|`|ab1f7d57468e90d9853d1bcd3fa04263aa	i felt like this for a while and i know how annoy it gets, i eventually just had what seemed like the longest week of my life, and i broke down and cried for a while....it seemed terrible but after that i felt so much better, so maybe you just need one really good cry.|`|N89HLv92aa	hmmm maybe you are just stressed lately.

What's your environment like? Your family? Your friends? There could be external factors that are somewhat stressful to you and affect your emotional state, whether you realize it or not. Stresses from your job, not getting enough sleep, etc. can affect your brains ability to handle stress and can send you in a spiral.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people feel emotional for no reason at all, and oftentimes this is the result of a chemical imbalance. If this is the case, then the first thing I would recommend (and this might seem trivial, but give it a shot) is exercise. Physical activity increases endorphins in your system and provides a quick and welcome relief to some of your trouble. If that doesn't work over a period of about 3 months, I would suggest seeing a professional. Sometimes chemical supplements or therapy is just what you need.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)<br>  <br>  Kat|`|dc9e4f3e25ec8fe1fd9236bd369c151faa	Sometimes when we are upset, smaller things trigger an emotional response. Like if you're having an ongoing fight with a friend, you're going to be more sensitive to everything during your day, even the slightest thing that goes wrong, due to that underlying problem. Also being tired, not eating right or worrying about something could make you more sensitive. If none of this sounds right, then you should write down your thoughts a little to figure out the underlying problem. If that fails, ask your doctor. Good luck and feel better.|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	i think it might b that time of the moth. idk 4 sure

on5NQxhkaa	I think you are right to an extent... I think people tend to exaggerate their pasts into either "wonderful" or "traumatic" expierences... for example, people with a lot of problems in their life use a "bad" childhood as a scapegoat as to why they are unhappy. Adversly, some are so wrapped up in their misery that looking back they believe childhood was wonderful because anything seems appealing compared to what they are going through at the moment. <br>  <br>  I often do the same thing as you and look back on my childhood and tend to remember it to be better than it was... that might be because I recently lost my dad. I try to pick out the really good memories that I had with him because it makes me feel better.. I am aware its a coping strategy, however, it helps. I think you might be doing the same thing with your life because you are currently in rough patch. <br>  <br>  We all want to believe life is great, like you described it being in movies and such... and I think parts of it are. You say you are in junior year... do you mean high school?? I myself am a sophmore in college so I've been through the loops of life (some at least, I'm obviously still young) and I know life has its great moments and its tragedies.<br>  <br>  I think in the end you take the good with the bad... I'd love to learn the "secret" to life and how to make the most of it, and maybe that will come with time.. but in the meantime I just make due with what the day brings, so good luck with you to doing the same.<br>  <br>  I feel like I just had a really in depth conversation, lol.|`|1e5523b91684d9e2d724ebb0f10a647aaa	Life gets complicated, and the more it does, the things you consider to be "not that epic" in your younger days will actually seem quite carefree and more meaningful and sweeter than in the way you think of them now.<br>  <br>  It takes a little distance to see some things, and at certain points, things begin to look differently for a variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the ride.|`|FZswn5rxaa	This is quite normal.

We don't look back on our childhood's so much in our junior year. Now, when you're 30 or 40 or older, then it becomes more evident how joyful childhood was; with no responsibilities.<br>  <br>  Yes, life gets better and more complicated . . . you get a lot more freedom to do certain things once you reach adulthood; yet, you have less time (with jobs, mortgages, bills, spouse or seeking one, children, etc.) to do them. You also can study what you want, instead of what you "have to" and that's fun . . . anytime you can study what you want, in college even if your in your 70s [there are also stories of people in their 80s and 90s going back to college] and/or you can travel the world (if you have the funds or inclination or join the service [there are rules there, though] or have a travel job). And yes, you have to follow the laws of the land or lose your freedom.<br>  <br>  And yes, in time, you will lose loved one's to death . . . and hopefully, aside from the natural span of life, won't suffer any other or too many traumatic events (such as death of a loved one) or an allergy!  Death will happen . . . hope it later, rather than sooner for you. Yet, grandparents and parents usually, naturally, will pass before us.<br>  <br>  One call tell you are very highly intelligent . . . and that is great! Your theory is not correct. You are just trying to grow up a bit too fast. You cannot and will not understand, no matter how mature you are intellectually, what it is like to be 20, 30, 40 or 50 years old until you reach those ages. And sweetness, it is like a whole other world!<br>  <br>  As you get older, you care a lot less about what others think and thus, the shyness lifts, more and more. <br>  <br>  Focus on what makes you happy . . . and don't be in such a hurry to look back at childhood. Sounds like yours was good, as was mine and I prefer (even at the age of 45 years young) to focus on right here, right now and the things I want to do when I grow up!!! <br>  <br>  I have been blessed throughout my years . . . I have gotten to act, sing, write, love, travel, read, laugh and am still having fun! I have had my share of loss and pain . . . and yet, live every moment with love and light and seek, always, to follow that which makes my heart sing!<br>  <br>  That's the way to live a full, wonderful life! I hope I can do it until I am, at least, 100 years old!!!

Most shy people are loners and lonely and are called introverts. When these types of people understand how they tick they seem to come out of the woodwork and start utilising their many skills and talents and people like yourself normally find professions working with people, because you have an innate empathy and intuitive. These professions come in the form of Drs, Nurses, counsellors, lawyers, social workers, artists.<br>  <br>  Life is absolutely great and its all around you, but you won't see it because you're looking at doom and gloom.

VsmO0prvaa	Confidence is something that can't be taught.  It's a series of success.  It's mainly doing something you aren't comfortable with, and doing them.  Sort of like your first day at school or work, you kinda peep in the room to see who's in there and whats going on, making sure you're in the right place, and not well aware of whats going on.  After going there for a while you sort of just walk in the room and know whats expected, because you've done it a ton of times. <br>  <br>  Confidence is like learning to be comfortable, with things you aren't comfortable with yet.  As long as you don't face the things you're aren't comfortable with, you will not gain the confidence.  Like talking to the girl you really like, or talking to strangers in line, learning to drive, and so on.  You can build confidence by even doing little things, like talking to people in line, or just complimenting a few strangers every day.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you out.|`|onDL0PRIaa	By realizing himself|`|AA10898432	first of all, have faith in your power of your own thinking and answers instead of dependence on others..it's all inside of you not "out there"|`|qK1iEcVhaa	By having success or by jumping into whatever thing you fear and just do it, and once you can truly say "I could do it" then there you have confident
qSnF1jseaa	people criticize the wealthy's earning because they believe it is usually it is done by kicking the little guy, breaking laws, and other immoral ways. Whereas the people with less wealth, such as teachers, service workers feel like they work incredibly hard, and have no opportunity to become extremely wealthy (in terms of money).
cab63c7629d665e7d2f0151df748fdd5aa	Based on what you said, I think it'd be good for you to talk with a therapist and get some help in dealing with your anger and in changing your perspective of the world.
YQOT68xFaa	Just run away. Seriously. I've yet to meet a woman who is in the third trimester who can run more than a few steps. That or wave a submarine sandwich in her face to distract her. Or maybe some Chinese food. That should do the trick.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Move out of the ghetto.|`|AA10267825	In my opinion, any woman who is pregnant and willingly getting into fights already has put herself at risk and therefore gets whats coming. However, that baby had no choice in who its mother was and therefore you should take precautions. All you can really do is block the blows, hold her at arms length, or hold her arms down by her sides and once she calms down, call the cops and file a report. She learns a lesson and you dont get labeled as a low life who beat ona pregnant woman.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Oh gee, good point.

pTlnCNYJaa	Its just because you THINK most geeks are guys so you only notice the geeks that are guys.  There are plenty of girl geeks in the world.  Lets try an excercise.  Say the word ELEPHANT.  Now, I don't want you to think about an elephant....Did you think of an elephant?<br>  <br>  Now that I've told you there are plenty of girl geeks you will start to notice them.  The next time you are out and about look for all the girl geeks.  And if you still don't see any, go visit your nearest University.  Girl geek city!!|`|WSgvL4Csaa	Most guys are not geeks, no more than most girls are dumb.  Look beyond your idea of what is "cool and hip."  Look at movie stars for instance.  Many male stars are very cool.  So are rock stars and business executives and sports athletes, etc.  Maybe your age group is a little more mature than the corresponding opposite sex age group, but that will change as we all get older.|`|AA12231462	I think because they aren't usually multitasking  creatures so geek is written all the way through like brighton rock - Or mnaybe its because women d the categorising.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	I don't think that's the case.

KG0B5dNFaa	Sounds like you've been pretty polite about it and she doesn't get the message. If all of your friends feel the same way you should all tell her about it. It will be very awkward for everyone especially her but at least you won't have to deal with those problems anymore. The only other solution is to cut her off and just stop talking to her. Some people are just weird like that though and they won't stop.|`|GStTSYf4aa	You need to sit down and have a serious conversation.  tell her that her actions make you feel uncomfortable and if she can't stop doing them then you will no longer be able to hang out with her.  If it doesn't change then maybe it is best to stop hanging out with her, because you should feel comfortable around your friends.|`|zJv1Cxuoaa	is she trying to get your attention? keep talking to her about how you feel or just take a break from hamging out with her|`|i93vyIkIaa	She seems like she is a little too attention hungry for her age which could indicate a needy personality. Unless you want her to be more aggressive, you should squash this behavior as soon as possible. You should be tactful as possible since she could have emotional problems which could cause her to react with either hostility or even depression. Maybe it would be a good idea to consult with a counselor before approaching her about this. Try to be understanding and don't be too harsh. Good Luck!!|`|zZrKhn9eaa	Tell her she's crossing your personal space/ boundaries. <br>  If she still doesn't stop... pick her nose.

de716a7218c6535ff5cb2a195dc59d50aa	Serial killers and sex offenders are two different criminal populations.<br>  <br>  Sex offenders tend to have a lower base rate of reoffending compared to all types of other offenders. So a burglar is more likely to reoffend than a sex offender for example.<br>  <br>  Secondly, while there is no catch all cure for sex offenders, there are many successful cognitive/behavioural style treatments programs out there that do help sex offenders to control their behaviour and impulses to help them avoid high risk situations where they may offend again.<br>  <br>  Studies tend to put the success rates between 90 and 95% compared to controls. Meaning that of any group going through the program, 5-10% of that group will go out and reoffend.<br>  <br>  You put this figure on top of the already low base rate of reoffending, only a small minority of sex offenders tend to reoffend.

AA11101704	Yo soy lesbiana y tengo un hijo. El apenas tiene 11 meses. Para serte sincera, no me gustaría para nada que él fuera gay porque es algo muy difícil. Yo he sufrido bastante con mi familia por el hecho de que yo soy. Aparte la sociedad todavía tiene bastantes prejuicios en contra de la homosexualidad. Y a decir verdad, no quiero ese tipo de vida para mi hijo. Pero, si el lo fuera claro que lo aceptaría como es, nunca lo abandonaría y siempre lo iba a apoyar incondicionalmente porque lo amo.|`|daedbdf1b4fa17ee4f678ab5d6dc0b34aa	Aceptarlo como persona... si duda, tengo muchos amigos gay.<br>  Pero lo llevaría a un tratamiento, pues algunos  de mis amigos también han decidido dejar esa conducta. Y lo han logrado.<br>  <br>  Hay varias organizaciones en EEUU y en toda américa para liberarse del comportamiento gay.<br>  <br>  No es suficiente con que tu hijo quiera hacer algo para dejarlo ?lo dejarías suicidarse si lo intenta?... por ejemplo un cleptómano o un maníaco depresivo les "nace"  tener conductas suicidas o de ratero.... les nace... ?eso hace que sea natural? Por supuesto que no!!<br>  <br>  ?Qué es lo natural lo que cada uno quiere?... no !  lo natural es lo que la naturaleza permite... y la esterilidad de una relación gay es  la obvia manifestación de que esa es una conducta antinatural.<br>  <br>  Por eso le brindaría mi apoyo para librarse de eso.|`|afa9205095cb42c246de523d7848dbf1aa	No creo que mi hijo fuera gay, en primer lugar porque lo consagraría a Dios, en segundo lugar porque desde muy peque?o le inculcaría los valores y verdades universales, no daría pie a que se afeminara. La educación en el crecimiento es de suma importancia.<br>  <br>  La única forma en que mi hijo pudiera ser homosexual tendría que darse de manera naturalmente fisiológica, pero estos casos no son los más comunes. Y claro que tendría que aceptar su naturaleza, ante todo es un ser humano y es mi hijo.<br>  <br>  Un auténtico homosexual nace fisiológicamente afeminado.<br>  <br>  Aquellos que a quienes les funciona su organismo y sus hormonas de manera viril o masculinamente natural se han hecho homosexuales, no han nacido así aunque pretendan enga?ar al mundo. <br>  <br>  La homosexualidad no natural tiene su origen en aspectos profundamente psicológicos muy complejos...<br>  <br>  También puede darse de acuerdo al medio ambiente en que se desarrollaron, por ejemplo si de peque?os alguien los indujo a ello, si sufrieron abusos sexuales por alguien de su mismo sexo, malas influencias desde peque?os, etcétera.  Hay incluso quienes son bisexuales pero por un afán de experimentar más sensaciones o porque el ser bisexual u homosexual representa una forma de poder, es decir, se sienten especiales o más seguroso el considerarse a sí mismos más "open mind" o evolucionados que los demás, rechazando al sexo femenino o atreviéndose a hacer lo que otros no se atreven a hacer. Eso les produce seguridad y una sensación de poder. <br>  <br>  Hay quienes simplemente experimentan mayor placer sexual en la relación homosexual, y hay otros más cuya naturaleza es tan tímida o tan temerosa al fracaso o rechazo de la mujer, que se inclinan a tener relaciones con gente de su mismo sexo porque se sienten más comprendidos y seguros....|`|4cb23f85f2ff2e450acd30a9a377aac9aa	Lo aceptaria igual, y mi trato hacia él no cambiaria en lo absoluto....|`|82a5089dcb2c747800d24f6fcfb30282aa	Lo iba a querer mas que antes, lo apoyaria, y le daria consejos para cuidarse y no me afectaria mi trAto con el|`|f4fa1275ef00b153650b538b665d1805aa	Porqué no? es mi hijo siempre,sea gay o hetero,la condición sexual no es ninguna lacra,lacra lo son esos incultos que opinan que los gays son degenerados y que no aceptarían un hijo gay,presumen de cristianos y de demócratas y no tienen nada de ámbas.<br>  Y a los qu opinan que la homosexulidad "tiene cura" les diría que lo que no tiene cura es la estupidez.<br>  Mi hijo siempre sería mi hijo,los que opinan lo contrario demuestran que no saben amar.|`|b57bd8bb4c061a20573473ff4cce6954aa	PS SI ES ALGO Q DIOS ME LO PUSO EN EL CAMINO POR ALGO|`|0d6b22152d2787f2a8097d9be330aeddaa	Pues te podría decir que lo seguiría queriendo igual, porque no tiene nada que ver su forma de ser, pero esa es mi opinión ahorita, quien sabe ya otros 10 o 15 a?os.Si me explico, en la mayoría de los casos te tienen que pasar ese hecho por el que estas cuestionando o juzgando, para poder comprender que se siente y como reaccionarias.|`|25e10e7fa42dc0225585171ea774719eaa	y porque no?|`|2ce532fc00c0daec69b544649a3fa531aa	Buena pregunta....yo lo aceptaria|`|31ec4041b753af0c1312f9d18766a47faa	claro que lo aceptaría, no me afectaría para nada! todo seguiría igual, hay que respetar la decisición de cada persona.<br>  saludos!!|`|3380afe892c414d9d46bcfcbc9f3b2c6aa	tengo una hija y aceptaría q fuera lesbiana el único disgusto q me podría llevar al enterarme seria x saber lo difícil q lo tendría ella en esta vida ,mi trato hacia ella seria el mismo ,no solo x q seguiría siendo mi hija ,también x q considero q esto no es algo q se pueda elegir ,creo q cada uno nace como es y q ni la educación ni nada puede cambiar esto.|`|61321a9f690b52e4a4bfb87e6adb5637aa	claro que lo aceptaria|`|e1a6fc6b81e2622bddf3990e64184928aa	Claro! no haria como otros que los echan de casa o se creen que estan enfermos.

Z9cX3oXEaa	First, I want to say I'm so sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  My mom died 3 years ago on March 3 from cancer, and right after she died, I started having dreams about her. My dad told me the same thing, that your husband told you. He said that he wished he could see her in his dreams. It takes time to get through it.<br>  <br>  I went to grief counselors and psychiatrists. It helped a little, but I just prayed and took it day by day. Eventually the dreams stopped. I'm not fully over her death, but I can sleep now.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your family.|`|cYgJQDQSaa	I suggest you see a councellor, it sounds like you may be suffering a form of Post traumatic stress. You just need to talk it over with a professional, it's more than likley a combination of issues. Guilt (even if there's nothing to be guilty of), fear (having to look after your niece, and how she will cope). <br>  If the daughter is old enough, it may well be worth taking her with you, it can help to show how much pain you're feeling.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	You are very blessed to see her.  Talk to your sister and tell her how you feel.  Tell her to stop visiting you in dreams.  She'll always be with you, they dont disappear off the face of the earth they just take on a spiritual form and go to the next realm.  They hear and see us all the time. The dreams will fade when you stop missing her but until then just keep talking to her.|`|N8P4JSUqaa	Someone you loved and were very close to ended their life very abruptly. This was traumatic for you, and you'll absolutely never forget her. There is no shortcut to getting over such a situation, nor should there be. Over time the pain will subside and you'll be more at ease. But you will always love and miss your sister.|`|pzhnKxxGaa	im so sorry about your loss its still very raw as the pearson above said u really  do need to speak to a councillor , no body nos what happens when we die so perhaps u should also try going to her grave side and talking to ur sister take a photo so she feels closer|`|0iOMtMoBaa	<a href="http://allinifo.colors.at" rel="nofollow">http://allinifo.colors.at</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|dNWtLxPlaa	Hmmmm........Suicides can be Mind bending for family and friends.....<br>  Perhaps its the fact that you are still slightly truamatized......|`|IgGTc2eeaa	u should see a counsiller about this and that might help ask ur parents if u can yeh thats all i can help u with im useless|`|XxgXpyK0aa	see a phycic or a councillar might help|`|gASz3hDWaa	I offer my condolences to you  and your family.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	I'm so sorry about your sisters death.My sister and best friend is now dead for 2 years.I see her often in my dreams and at first it hurt so much,it was like waking up and losing her all over again.I miss her so much and have come to treasure the dreams I have of her,it feels like we connect in some way.I feel your pain and cannot say it will get better as I still miss her everyday,but I know she would scold me if I give up hope living.Just take it one day at a time.|`|lb8FBhWnaa	I am so so SO sorry!!! That must be terribly hard for you! I can't even imagine how much you are going through right now :(<br>  I really sugest speaking to a therapist. Anyone who goes through things like what you are going trough need extra help. Its really hard, and speaking to a therapist will help you get through it. <br>  I hope everything works out!<br>  (Hugs)|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You are getting these dreams as you have concerns. I know it is easier said than done but try to keep yourself busy. Before going to bed pray for yourself and also for her soul to rest in peace|`|YOb8NPvRaa	I believe that dreams are to help us solve problems.  Try to think of what each dream might mean or how it represents what you're going through now.  Use them as a tool to sort through your problems and emotions, you'd be surprised how it can actually give you some clarity and understanding in life.  Obviously you are going through a traumatic experience, especially now that you are now raising your niece for your late sister.<br>  <br>  The one about you and her as kids in the good old days I'd interpret as a reminder to keep and cherish the good times you and your sister had growing up; because you are both young in the dream that says to me that you should share the wonderful childhood memories of her mother and you growing up with your niece who will only know her mother through you and your family.<br>  <br>  The dream when you and her are talking and then she uses the gun is disturbing and I understand why you'd want them to stop.  Not sure how to interpret this one since it's likely something more deep then I'd know about.<br>  <br>  If you cannot go to a councilor I'd recommend you use the interpretation method and see if that helps you rationalize your feelings etc.  Good luck and be strong.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	first i am so sorry for your sister. but you have to accept this and i think when we lose some close person we refuse to accept this how we will not see him or her again so dreams is the suitable way for continuing the existence of this person you find the way to make her still in your life. may be it is bless if you deal with it in the right way you can read this article at <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/2446/112/Simple-Ways-To-Experience-An-Amazingly-Real-Lucid-Dream.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a> <br>  this article will make you able to control your dreams and the suitable way to handle them and this also at <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/1174/115/I-Love-My-Dreams.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a><br>  this will give you idea about dreams best wishes

I don't like sharing a bed, also when I sleep you can fight a war in a neighboring room. But the moment some one or something enters my room (it doesn't matter how quietly), I wake up.<br>  Don't worry, I know lots of grown women who sleep with teddy bears.|`|hpzfccwaaa	You want to know how many people have felt safe or content at cuddling the teddy bear. There are plenty of people who still find the teddy bear acceptable to embrace during the stress periods.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	course its okay, you've been through some tuff stuff and anything to make you feel comfortable and safe is all good.|`|jfd81I9iaa	You would be surprised at the things people have for comfort... Although I do not "Need" it to sleep anymore I still sleep with a blanket I have had since I was a kid. Who cares what people think about bringing it to camp... tell them it has special importance to you and to back out of your business. And if they want to judge you for the possessions you own, they are not worth your time anyway.|`|XUnsJ2xjaa	its okay. everyone has things that keep them secure. dont worry. If something happens at summer camp (because i know what teenagers can be like) you have  options. <br>  1. Laugh along with them and make it a joke<br>  2.ignore them|`|H7uyI4iGaa	Don't panic. Just keep your teddy bear with you until you got somebody to sleep with. Just hope he will be as comfortable as your teddy bear.|`|onDL0PRIaa	i think you're disturbed with that kind of incidents you mention<br>  try not to be alone don't see tv for longtime throw your teddy bear away
ZHJuK1QNaa	I don't know if this is at all what you are looking for.  But I remember doing a study where I went to a mall to see how many people I could make eye contact with. I also smiled at people and recorded how many people smiled back or looked away.  It was really interesting to see peoples reactions.  Most people are really uncomfortable if you smile at them. <br>  You could go to a mall and ask people how they feel if complete strangers make eye contact or smile at them.  You will get a huge variety of answers.  Human behavior is fascinating.

But, I, personally, don't perceive an impending worldwide depression.<br>  <br>  My take is that the financial system has been digitized to the point that a few financial wizards were able to metaphorically hack the system to show anything they wanted to show.  In particular, people like David Li were able to develop theoretical benchmark correlates which were incorrect, but a means to present bundled securities as highly rated and secure bonds.<br>  <br>  We now know what went wrong and we are in the process of developing regulations to criminalize this type of aberrant behavior and to convert financial reporting to a common thread which will allow everyone, including the individual investor, to analyze performance and to understand the source and the path of almost all financial transactions.<br>  <br>  We are on the way back, rather than free falling to the bottom, as many now perceive.
kAceP1pzaa	(I believe)<br>  You need to RELAX, and not stress out about what people think of you. Meaning, take this time to work on yourself, only you. You are way to insecure about how others feel about you. You feel a constant need to please others. Just Breathe, You are too overly stressed. Chill, talk to a therapist, I highly recommend that. I don't want to see all the nice hair you talk about fall out. :)<br>  <br>  Love yourself girl!|`|r8VvBxM6aa	I know it's not easy, but once you can block out everyone else's negativity you can focus on your own positivity. If you need, write out a list of things you like about yourself, go shopping and give yourself a makeover. Whatever you do though, do it for you, and not to please anyone. At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>

Before this study behaviorists believed that food established the connection between mother and infant|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	the answer is C.|`|AcFBETxAaa	Omg! I had a textbook in the sixties with that little monkey and wire etc. on the front cover. I remember that experiment well. I am likely wrong, been a long time, but I sort of remember the GE labs? Cannot remember the psychologists who did it. Made me think about how some mothers fail to nurture their young. Grrrr! Kids need that and the money studies show how important. They would just die from lack of attention of inempt mothers. My mother was kinda like the wire cage version.<br>  <br>  I recall the rat population studies. That is one that stuck with me. Crowd them up in a cage and they get miserable and mean. I think it is no different for humans. Worked all my life to move to the country and the house burned down and now back inthe damned crowded city in an apt. Life is a trip. Coping is a bigger challenge some times more than others.

I can personally say.. Marriage has nothing to do with the over populations of many countries ... Out of wedlock sex have become a every day normal event .... young girls are easily to have sex as young men .. We need to start teaching our youth the moral values of maintaining our bodies as temples and showing them that life is not easy having children... We give our youth to much freedom and the teli, music and video games are no help also ... I have seen cases where a young man still not in his mid 20's having 7 children out of wed lock from different girls ... Marketing also give our youth the idea that being over expose is cool and sexy ... What ever sell that what our governments permit ... Western life style is not good for many and should be banded from many countries and parents should start becoming more involved in our youths lives .. Time we start putting our foot down and letting them know we are the parents not them ...  if not this will still be an issue with over populations ..|`|5baa06d71b4cee5e338e688d99a2fff7aa	Why does marriage have to be banned?

Dreams are often our subconscious mind trying to tell us something... but the meaning is metaphorical, not literal, but you need to figure out what is scaring you about your relationship!

One is separation of the races, but that is not realistic.<br>  <br>  The more realistic one is when people get to know others of another race.  Humans are not that different from each other.  We may find different ways of attaining the same goals, but in reality we pretty much have the same goals.<br>  <br>  We all want to be part of a group, we all want what is best for our family, we all want to be part of something bigger, we all want the world to be a better place.<br>  <br>  Racism usually stems from the belief that those of another race want something that we don't want, and therefore they "want" to make a world a worser place.  But when people get to know each other, and find that their beliefs and wants are quite similar, racism tends to die away of its own accord.<br>  <br>  Problem is getting people together who do not want to be together...That is the main reason racism still exists.

ZHJuK1QNaa	I think it makes you feel better because the right music can pull your  thoughts to different places, events or things.  Music is used to enhance moods all the time.  You will never hear sad music playing during of a happy scene in a movie.   Music can create positive images and  raise your endorphins.|`|pod9nzo7aa	If you listen to real music it will help settle you down because you like it.

Music is like a universal language that anyone can understand through the beats or lyrics to a song that someone is going through and therefore, you can or will have a connection with that song, or you listen to an old song and think ''oh my god, i remember what i was going through a couple of years ago''.

b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	Dreams manifest themselves in symbols. Do you face a major separation or change in your life.  There are many dream dictionaries online that have explanations for different symbols.  What's been going on in your life for the last month? The brain is amazing and often, what bothers us manifests itself in our dreams.<br>  <br>  Casket (from Dreammoods.com)<br>  <br>  To see a casket in your dream, indicates that it is time to end a situation or relationship. Additionally, it symbolizes a completion of a project or lifestyle and a beginning of another. In this regards, this symbol may represent new opportunities.  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's all how you look at it. Dreams can be helpful but it's rare that they are literal. I wouldn't worry..|`|mwW4zIwIaa	"To dream of your own death, indicates a transitional phase in your life. You are becoming more enlightened or spiritual.

QRPvIB8Yaa	Most evolutionary psychologists dont think so. They think that it conflicts with a mans tendency to stick around after he has impregnated the woman. Human rapists operate on a hit and run basis.

Our bodies, male and female, can physically react when we want nothing to do with the stimulation or reaction.<br>  <br>  Ok, so some god gave men the capacity for erections and women no camera-shutter like shield to prevent an unwanted intrusion. This means this god person is saying "Just because you can means you should, to hell with any moral decisions and free will! just do what your penis can do!" By this logic you should have no issue with homosexual anal sex, consensual or not, and regardless of which side you are on.<br>  <br>  What does the killing of young have to do with rape? It's certainly not okay, but I just don't see how it relates.<br>  <br>  Anyway, other animals do it to prevent competition for resources. Evolutionarily speaking, the few that are killed help keep the species in balance compared to the many that survive. Why do you think mother bears are the most ferocious?

In serious threats, the woman has to leave the state & start all over again wiht a new social security number (her college degree, if she had one, will not be relevent b/c she has a new identity). She may also end up homeless (up to 50% of homeless women fled DV). <br>  <br>  We should ask batterers to leave, but so far we have not. As for batterers programs, they suck. Do the research. They have high recidivism rates. Like alcholics, they must ADMIT they have a problem. There  is a HUGE problem with denial and blaming the woman for their behavior. <br>  <br>  As for rates of abuse, credible stats put it at 85-15 (CDC, WHO, DOJ...). There is a big difference between battering (physical, sexual &/or emotional abuse w/ high degree of control, coercion, threats) and common couple violence (women particpate in more). <br>  <br>  As far as men not reporting, yes, they are. Research it. With pro-arrest policies, police arrest women. Men also say the violence is mutual and she gets arrested. <br>  <br>  Both men and women, however, can fail to report it out of embarassment (both sexes), shame, not wanting to see the father/mother of your children go to jail. <br>  <br>  There is a propaganda machine out there in high gear. <br>  <br>  Get the facts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another interesting question would be - what happens to women that leave? <br>  You see, when we say women are stupid or "just asking for it" we do the same thing to her that the batterer does. <br>  And, we should ask ourselves as a society, why do we focus on *her* staying. Why not focus on his behavior, as u point out. But also, we should ask what happens when she DOES leave?????<br>  <br>  -homeless<br>  -custody battles. (do you really think the batterer will let her have the kids????? people need to understand batterer behavior when they analyze custody battles. see the Leadership Council on Child Abuse for info on how OFTEN batterers get custody)<br>  -dead<br>  <br>  yeah, some may make it out and improve their lives, but these women have an uphill battle. they've left everything, they lack money, they have to battle it out in family court for years, they often lose custody of their kids, they suffer from depression & ptsd, they attempt suicide, etc. <br>  <br>  there really arent' too many happy endings.<br>  <br>  why is that|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	well i believe you question is "why don't we expect batterers to leave?"  if this is correct, then the answer is simple, because if we knew about their actions, we wouldn't just expect them to leave, they would be forced to under order of law.  The victims are the ones that are having the negative consequences forced upon then, and so in order to rectify that, they are the ones that need to have the desire to change that.  The batterer doesn't leave because they are in a great scenario as far as they are concerned.  They are getting their way and they have a compliant victim, what could be better?  Also, to insinuate that the questions of why people batter others have never been asked is not only insulting, its misleading.  There are piles and piles of studies that extrapolate why people abuse their spouses, whether it be for power issues, control, fear, or any number of psychological problems, not to mention just plain violent.  I think the idea that most people believe all an abuse victim must do is leave and that will make everything alright is believed by a large amount of society, quite falsely I might add. Leaving an abuser does take more work than simply waling out the door, but help is available everywhere, especially if the victim goes to the police, and documents the abuse, where there is actually something the law can do about the violence.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	Leaving would be the reasonable thing for a batterer to do, but if the person is a batterer they are by definition not a reasonable person. <br>  <br>  Btw You are still blocking me Ms Clarke. I don't block you.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	The problem is that people assume too many things, mainly because of what they usually see in the media.  They assume that:<br>  <br>  1. All victims of abuse are women- Anyone can be abused: Men, women, children, etc.  Some groups are simply more encouraged to talk about it.<br>  <br>  2. The victims don't leave because they can't afford to- This may be true for a lot of people, but there are people who stay with abusers because they feel that that's the best they can do.  They don't feel that they deserve respect, mainly because they don't respect themselves.<br>  <br>  3. The victim did something to bring on the abuse- No one deserves abuse, period.  Self-defense is one thing, abuse is another.<br>  <br>  4. "Abuse"=Physical assault- There are several types of abuse, among them being sexual, physical, mental, emotional, verbal, etc.  So, let's say an abuse victim is successful in their career, physically healthy, financially well-off, etc. Most people would say, "Why don't they just leave?"  Well, if you're being mentally and emotionally abused, you've probably shut down mentally and can't even figure out how to get away from the person or situation.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Uh, it's not as though no one has been studying why btterers batter, and how to get them to stop. There's a LOT of literature on this, and much progress has been made. There's are programs that teach batterers to not batter.<br>  <br>  If a woman is being battered (or a man, for that matter -- I dispute that it's a vast majority of batterers that are men; I've heard otherwise, but men are less likely to go public), then one wants her out of the situation, for her protection; and one wants to help her not get into similar situations in the future. That's called being a compassionate human being who wants to rrevent suffering.<br>  <br>  Unless they can be arrested and incarcerated, you can't expect a batterer to leave; you need to get the victim out and to safety.<br>  <br>  I can't help wondering when all this stuff was written; we've made a LOT of progress on getting legal authorities to take DV seriously -- they used to just calm things down,t hen leave them together, rather than using the law to stop the situation.<br>  <br>  It's simply not true that no one looks at the behavior and intentions of the perpetrator. Or that no one is doing anything to stop batterers.<br>  <br>  What good would "expecting batterers to leave" DO, exactly? It's not going to GET them to leave, unless the law is brought in, which does often happen.<br>  <br>  The point is to get the victim out. It's not the only point, but seems to be the main point of the original thing. No one advocates dealing with victims as the ONLY response to the problem.|`|1suTgWGoaa	From which store or magazine do you buy your statistics?<br>  the same lies and same manipulation of facts!|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	I think the victims leave because they are the ones who want change. The batterers are happy with their own live in scapegoat and don't want a change. In an ideal world, the whole community would band together and help the victim. But that doesn't work in the real world. Lots of times the victim says "But I want to be with him, I love him." My own niece said just that even after he wrenched her daughters arm and broke two bones in her (the niece's) back. So many victims just don't want to be apart, until they are dead or finally decide to wake up and see what is happening. One more thing, if the victim stays where the batterer can find her, he sometimes comes back and really hurts or kills her for daring to defy him. She is safer somewhere else.|`|4jYgEo0Uaa	who would want to STAY in a hostile environment?   For the batterer, it feels like home.  He loves it there.  it is a nice cozy environment.  Obivously anyone living in a hateful environment that is dangerous should most certainly leave that environment.   asking the person who is cozy and comfortable to leave is kind of a lost cause don't you think?|`|dmCyY2SKaa	People who are in abusive relationships are like drug addicts... they know it's bad but they are addicted to it, and over time they need the abuse/drug to function on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  If my house were on fire, would I try to put out the flames or would I run out of the house? It's common sense... why would the abuser leave his/her victim? They are not the ones that are being abused. The person being abused needs to run away, just like they were running out of a burning house. Yet the main characteristic that most, if not all, victims of abuse have is that they just WON'T leave their partners. It doesn't matter how secure they are, how financially independent they are, what kind of support network they have... victims of abuse WON'T leave their partners, and when they do, they come BACK. This is what the rest of us get so frustrated trying to understand! The whole community could try as hard as they could to get the victim to leave his/her abuser... but the victim won't leave, and when they do, they typically go back to their abuser. Just like a drug addict.<br>  <br>  When there are children involved, I feel that both the abuser and person being abused are guilty. They are both playing a sick game and putting children in the middle of it.

You'd never understand anything.<br>  <br>  You aren't psychic so much as you are having difficulties accepting how your mind really works. Because you take what happens to the people around you so personally, your mind is actually saying its like you are the one doing the stuff. Your mind/intuition isn't saying this stuff is happening to you, its basically saying 'so long as you worry more about what happens to so-and-so, you're going to keep dreaming of their situations as being yours.'<br>  <br>  Your mind isn't telling you you're psychic, it's telling you that you're taking the things that happen to other people too seriously. You avoid your life so much that you are ending up living through the lives of those around you, so that they move on (which is what happens in the dreams) while you remain stuck. That isn't psychic, that's depressive and destructive.

mVTGl6HGaa	Homo Sapiens 1900 is a 1998 documentary directed by Peter Cohen, about various eugenics methods that were in practise in Europe during the first part of the 20th century.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>  [edit] Synopsis<br>  <br>  Eugenics is to be the scientific credo of the 20th century. The man credited with its invention, Francis Galton, says it is based on the concept that the evolution of man is crippled by the ill-conceived - those unfit to breed. The study of eugenics thus would concern itself with distinguishing the weed from the good flowers.<br>  <br>  Eugenics offers two approaches: positive eugenics, and negative eugenics. Positive eugenics aims towards creating better humans by careful mating, based on one's genetic makeup. Negative eugenics, on the other hand, seeks to prevent those deemed inferior from reproducing, and thus not impeding man's evolution.<br>  <br>  [edit] In the United States<br>  <br>  The documentary begins with a clipping of a 1916 American movie that trumpets the creed of eugenics. In The Black Stork, the lead character, physician Dr. Harry Haiselden playing himself, refuses to give a newborn, mildly deformed baby a live-saving operation (or, instead, makes the operation fatal). 'There are times when saving a life is a greater crime than taking one', he proclaims. It soon transpires that The Black Stork's climactic scene was, far from being merely fiction, actually a re-enactment of one of Dr.Haiselden's real-life cases[1], where he let a baby die because he considered the deformed baby to be a burden on society.<br>  <br>  Charles Davenport is credited with being the founder of the eugenics movement in the United States. He founds the Eugenics Record Office on Long Island , the purpose being to create a nation-wide eugenics register. He trains field workers to visit poor houses, prisons and mental institutions to document, and eventually eliminate through negative eugenics, inferior hereditary characteristics. To justify an aggressive campaign against blacks and immigrants, the eugenics movement use the concept of racial degeneration.<br>  <br>  The world's first compulsory sterilization laws are passed in 1907 . Shortly thereafter, over 20 states pass similar laws. Tens of thousands are sterilized in the process.<br>  <br>  [edit] In Sweden<br>  <br>  During the 1920s and 1930s, Sweden becomes a progressive welfare state, and within that period, the doctrine of racial hygiene is gradually implemented in the state's policy. In 1922, the world's first government institute on race biology, The Institute of Race Biology, is established. In 1934, parliament passes non-compulsory sterilization laws similar to that of the United States and Nazi-Germany. Unlike the two aforementioned countries, where sterilization was compulsory, in Sweden a 'democratic approach' is pursued, under the motto of 'opposition shall be overcome through persuasion'.<br>  <br>  The German and Swedish implementation of eugenics was bound by a common thread: a profound pride of their Nordic bloodline, and their belief that other ethnic groups were inherently inferior, and those groups should be prevented from interbreeding with the superior one. Hence, negative eugenics was the only logical outcome of Sweden's adoption of eugenics. In pursuit of establishing both positive and negative heritage, a comprehensive study was done on the Swedish population.Towns, parishes, prisons and correctional institutions were visited, and photographs and physical measurements of each person taken.<br>  <br>  [edit] In The Soviet Union<br>  <br>  The development of racial hygiene and eugenics was beset by problems from the very onset in the Soviet Union. The reason was that Mendel's theory on heredity was ideologically incompatible with the Soviet state, where human beings were regarded as being completely malleable through social engineering and education.<br>  <br>  After Lenin's death in 1924, German neurologist Oskar Vogt is requested to study Lenin's brain[2]. He establishes the Brain Research Institute in Moscow. One of its tasks is to collect all the brains of deceased, highly talented/intellectual Soviet individuals, with Lenin as its first specimen. By safeguarding the brains of the best and brightest for research purposes, these scientists hoped to map out and gain a full understanding of the brain.<br>  <br>  [edit] In Germany/Nazi-Germany<br>  <br>  Germany's first institute of race biology, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, opens in 1927, in Berlin. The Institute's chairman, Eugen Fischer, says its task is to 'investigate the connection between heredity, environment and crossbreeding, and to promote social measures which benefit racially sound individuals'. Though genetics research is gradually beginning to challenge some of the claims made by racial hygiene theories, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute reduces 'genetics' to just another 'auxiliary science' subordinate to eugenics.

glRSKBNfaa	It implies a person's social standing as related to their economic standing.  So a person who makes 200k a year and has been for some time now and lives in an aflluent neighborhood would be in a high socioeconomic group, being high in wealth and status.  A person who makes 200k a year but is just starting out would be in a mid to high socioeconomic group, high income, but still modest status.  And then it goes all the way down to the person who makes 20k a year and lives in the slums, who has no status and low income.

When interests rates rise bonds having a low interest decline in value so that their effective return is the same as bond with the new higher rate. This means investors that do not hold bonds to maturity will lose money when they sell them.
lWqOTYvWaa	You are one confused puppy, and nearly every thing you said was wrong. I'll see if I can help. The one thing you got right is that you know that the U.S. borrows money by selling Treasury Bonds, which is more than 99% of people understand.<br>  <br>  The U.S. is indeed the leading consumer among countries in the world, but that very much makes us the driving force, not the opposite. The world awaits anxiously for the U.S. to start buying again. You should understand that the whole entire purpose of an "economy" is to satisfy the consumption needs of consumers. Everything else is secondary and subservient to that.<br>  <br>  You are wrong that we don't produce and manufacture. First, the U.S. probably manufactures more tangible things today than at any time in the past. Wherever you are in the U.S., there is plenty of manufacturing going on around you, you are just ignorant of that activity. However, the overall economy grows much faster than manufacturing, and so we mostly do other things now. Same as with agriculture -- we grow far more food now than we did when 98% of the working population were farmers.<br>  <br>  But "production" includes all economic activities -- services, financial services, health care, legal services, software, etc. etc. And again, by far the U.S. produces much much more than any other country. You make a mistake in thinking there is anything special about manufacturing hard goods. There is not, and all economic activity is just as legitimate and wealth-creating.<br>  <br>  The U.S. government does not borrow money to consume imports. It's not useful to make that mistake and it leads people astray. Furthermore, you have the cycle backwards, which is common. We (as a whole country) don't have to borrow foreign money in order to turn around and buy their imports. We have plenty of money from our own internal wealth-generating activities. <br>  <br>  What happens is that because we are buying imports and generally paying in U.S. dollars, the foreign exporters accumulate U.S. dollars. They exchange some for local currency as needed, but they often use those dollars to buy U.S. treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets. Those willing foreign investments let the US gov't borrow more cheaply than might otherwise be the case, but American consumers are note depending on that foreign lending to go out and buy an iPod. (Are YOU? Think about it.)<br>  <br>  Your crucial mistake is that you think wealth is only generated by exporting manufactured products. This is not true: it's an ancient misunderstanding that results from zero-sum mercantilist thinking. Adam Smith disabused us of that mistake 230 years ago. Maybe you should read his book.<br>  <br>  Strictly speaking, wealth-creation and exports are unrelated. Some people create wealth by selling exports, but they'd create the same wealth by selling domestically instead, which is what 95% of the economy does. The exporting per se is not relevant.<br>  <br>  I could go on a bit but I'll stop for now. Hit the books, junior.|`|ktcGmpFPaa	Spotty is correct.  The US still exports more than anyone else in the world (except for Germany sometimes).  We are the wealthiest country in the world, so we import even more than we export.  When we import goods, other countries get US dollars,  They can return those dollars by buying US goods and services or buy are treasury bills which pay very low interest. <br>  <br>  Despite the recession, we stil have a relatively good economy.  This is not a depression and it will not be.  It is too bad the economy has fallen into a deep, long recession.  I say it could have been a short, mild recession but it isn't.  It may take a bit, but things will turn eventually.
glRSKBNfaa	Generally, The U.S. exhibits a very top down, hierarchical business system, where the business leaders at the top (CEOs CFOs etc) set a goal and then the lower rung workers follow their commands and do their jobs, they get little if any input.  When problems arise, the lower rung people appeal to their managers who settle it for them.<br>   <br>  In many asian structures, the workers on the bottom rung are allowed to improvise and add their thoughts to the making of a product, problems are settled within the group, and changes are implemented by the lower rung groups and then suggested to their managers. while the people at the top of the business are mainly there to settle disputes that could not otherwise be settled and have a global vision for the company.
NYU37jfGaa	The 1930s was the era of the Depression, and times were hard for most women, as for people in general.  In 'America's Women' Gail Collins writes:<br>  <br>  'The average family income dropped 40 percent between 1929 and 1933, and while men took second jobs or searched for better-paying employment in an oversaturated market, most of their wives stayed at home and struggled with what Eleanor Roosevelt called "endless little economies and constant anxieties."  At the bottom of the middle class, women worried about losing their homes and falling back into the class of renters - in Indianapolis, more than half the families with mortgages had defaulted on them by 1934.  Those higher on the economic ladder simply had to figure out how to keep up appearances without the help of servants(An ad for bleach showed a pair of elegant hands in a tub of dirty laundry and asked "doing it yourself these days?").<br>  <br>  The marriage rate dropped.  The nation declared a truce in its war against spinsterhood, and magazines once again ran articles about women who found happiness in life without a husband.  "Do you realize how many people in my generation are not married?" asked Elsa Ponselle, who was working as a teacher when the Chicago school system ran out of money and started paying its staff with I.O.U.s.  Her own boyfriend, a commercial artist, vanished when he was laid off from his job.  "It hit him like a ton of bricks" she said. <br>  <br>  The issue of whether married women should work was chewed over constantly in the newsapers and magazines, with the consensus coming down on the side of not.  A federal law, passed during the Depression, prohibited the employment of "married persons" whose spouses also worked for the government.  Of the people forced to quit, three-quarters were women. (Eleanor Roosevelt called the law "a very bad and foolish thing" - government salaries, she argued, were so low, a family needed two incomes just to get along).  Legislators in twenty-six states introduced laws completely banning the hiring of married women, although only Louisianna actually passed a law, and it was quickly declared unconstitutional.  More than three-quarters of the nation's public school distritcts refused to hire married teachers - unless they were male.<br>  <br>  Despite all this, the number of married women who worked continued to increase the decade.  Although most of these women struggled to keep poor families above water, a number were middle class and were attempting to preserve the good things they had gotten used to since World War I - like electric lights and gas stoves, and the ability to keep their children in school.  It was an important cultural shift that sent married women into the workforce in larger and larger numbers.  And for all the endless debate about whether or not it was good for society, the issue was resolved not by social theorists but by the wives themselves, determined that they and their families would not only survive but move up.<br>  <br>  A fifthof American families lived on farms in the 1930s, and their lives seemed different from the ones of the pioneeer era only in the advantages of automobiles and window screens.  In 1935, more than 6 million of America's 6.8 million farms had no electricity.  Only 20percent of farms in Missouri had a kitchen sink with a drain, 7 percent in Kentucky had indoor bathrooms.  A researcher visiting whtie tenant farm wives in the South found the women cooking from before daw till long after dark on wood-burning stoves and toting water from a well or remote spring to perform the dreaded washing chores, which had to be done at least once a week because they had so few clothes.  The wives bore their children at home with the help of a neighborhood "granny" and believed, like their colonial ancestors, that a woman could not conceive unless she had an orgasm. "It's not my fault that I had so many children - I never enjoyed it one bit." one told a visitor.<br>  <br>  The sense of solidarity among the poor was often - although certainly not always - strong.  Housewives with very little still fed hungry tramps who came to the door. Pauline Kael, a teenager during the Depression who grew up to be a famous film critic, remembered her mothing vowing "I'll feed them till the food runs out."  One of Lilian Wald's visiting nurses went to teach a young woman how to give her firstborn baby a bath, and found not one new baby but two.  The other girl had been in the next bed in the maternity ward, and when she confided she had no place to go, she was invited to the tiny tenement, where the husband gave up his half of the bed to the guest.  "I can't do much fo rher, but I can put a roof over her head." said the first mother.'|`|4jYgEo0Uaa	conservative fundamental christian women in the early 20th century began the movement of womens suffrage that eventually led to a woman's right to vote.|`|AA12092060	Which country? If you're talking about the United States, then we were trying to climb out of the Great Depression. Many men (a.k.a. "heads of households") didn't take available jobs, hoping to hold out for something more significant. Many women jumped into the workforce, being generally more willing to take whatever was available. This increase in women's employment in typically male-dominated jobs increased a woman's employability in the United States. Call it step in the direction of gender equality in the United States.
mVTGl6HGaa	Calamine brass is brass produced by a particular alloying technique using calamine, a zinc ore, rather than metallic zinc. Calamine brass was produced using proportions of two-sevenths fine copper, four-sevenths calamine, and one-seventh shruff (old plate brass). Calamine brass was the first type of brass produced, probably starting during the 1st millennium BC, and was not replaced in Europe by other brass manufactures until the 18th century (it is likely that Indian brass manufacturers had developed more advanced techniques some centuries earlier).<br>  <br>  Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, and when it was first developed, methods for producing metallic zinc were unknown. Metallurgists wishing to produce brass thus used calamine (actually a mixture of the virtually indistinguishable zinc ores smithsonite and hemimorphite) as the zinc component of brass. The resulting brasses, produced by heating a mixture of copper and calamine to a high temperature for several hours (allowing zinc vapor to distill from the ores and permeate the metallic copper), contained a significant amount of slag material resulting from the non-zinc components of calamine. The use of ore rather than metallic zinc also made it difficult to accurately produce the desired final proportion of copper to zinc. This process is known as cementation.<br>  <br>  The mineral calamine takes its name from La Calamine in Belgium. That area was the source of much of the medieval brass of northern Europe. Brass production was introduced to England in 1587 when several members of the Company of Mineral and Battery Works obtained a licence from the company (within whose monopoly it was) at built brass works at Isleworth. However a decade later the company obstructed the owners from mining calamine.<br>  <br>  New brass works were built by Jacob Momma, a German immigrant in 1649 at Esher, probably using Swedish copper. After the passing of the Mines Royal Act in 1689, further works were built near Bristol, where brass production became a major industry in the 18th century.[1][2] Later brass production sites in England included Cheadle and Birmingham.<br>  <br>  Calamine brass was slowly phased out as zinc smelting techniques were developed in Europe, which produced metallic zinc more suitable for brass production than calamine. However, the conversion away from calamine brass manufacture was slow; a British patent was awarded to William Champion in 1738, but the alloying of metallic zinc and copper to produce brass was not patented until 1781 (by James Emerson), and calamine brass mills persisted in South Wales until as late as 1858. The slow diffusion of this technology was probably the result of economic factors.

WSwDFwC5aa	The only good assets to own are those that produce a cash flow stream (just ask Warren Buffet).<br>  <br>  Gold and commodities are generally not good assets to own unless you're consuming them and you think you can buy them cheaper today than you'd be able to when you actually need them.<br>  <br>  Options, derivatives, and similar financial instruments are wise investments only if you have a damn good understanding of exactly how they work and how they are appropriately priced, which makes them inappropriate for about 99% of us.<br>  <br>  This leaves you with buying either rental real estate or the equity or debt obligations of companies or governments.  You can also choose to buy financial instruments that are dollar denominated (US government debt or US stocks) or that are denominated in foreign currencies (Chinese stocks or debt issued by EU countries, etc).<br>  <br>  The EU is in far worse shape than the US as far as governmental debt and prospects for medium-term growth goes.

mVTGl6HGaa	The Food Race refers to the relationship between food supply and human population postulated by Daniel Quinn. Quinn advocates the view that human population, like all other animals, is controlled by food supply. Thus, larger populations are the result of more abundant food supplies. So, intensification of cultivation in response to population growth----merely leads to still more population growth. Quinn compared this to the arms race in the Cold War, noting that any increase in food supply was met with a corresponding increase in population. Like Garrett Hardin, then, Quinn saw the only possible conclusions to the Food Race as either abandonment, or catastrophe.<br>  <br>  The similarities between this concept and a Malthusian catastrophe are obvious, but there are key differences. The primary problem in the Malthusian catastrophe is a population growing larger than its food supply can support; in Quinn's view, this is impossible, as population is a function of food supply, and not an independent variable. So, in some ways, Quinn's "Food Race" is in fact the opposite of the Malthusian problem. Quinn characterized Malthus' concern as, "How are we going to FEED all these people?" In juxtaposition, he stated the 'Quinnian problem' as "How are we going to stop PRODUCING all these people?"[1]<br>  <br>  The idea that human population is tied to food supply is contentious, however. Many biologists disagree with Quinn's assessment. While food supply certainly imposes an upper limit on population growth, they point out that culture, living standards, human intelligence and free will can impose lower, secondary limits to population growth. Critics also point out that the most significant population growth is occurring in the Third World, where regional food production is lowest. Meanwhile, the First World, where food is most plentiful, is undergoing a decline in birth rates. Quinn has suggested this results from international food distribution and has claimed that the farms of the First World fuel population growth in the Third. United Nations projections that world population will level off sometime in the near future also contradict Quinn's statements.<br>  <br>  In November 1998, Daniel Quinn made a video exploring these topics with Dr. Alan Thornhill of the Society for Conservation Biology, entitled, Food Production And Population Growth. Russell Hopfenberg has written at least two papers attempting to prove Quinn's ideas, one paper with David Pimentel entitled, "Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply," and another, "Human Carrying Capacity is Determined by Food Availability." Hopfenberg has also made available a narrated slide show entitled "World Food and Human Population Growth." Jason Godesky wrote an article in 2005 entitled "The Opposite of Malthus," which attempted to ground Quinn's work in a more solid, scientific framework. This was criticized by Rob McMillin with, "If We Open the Seacocks, is the Ship Unseaworthy?"

Cultural differences are THE factors that influence political boundaries.  The agitations and growing noise about separate states is a testimony to it. The political and financial gains for a few individuals also play a crucial role in whipping up this hysteria of course, that is the other dimension. The feelings,needs and inputs for development vary according to culture too but politicians from distant areas get elected on party basis and how much they would be able to contribute to their constituencies is the other dimension. P.V. Narasimha Rao was a case in point. Party supersedes alien candidature and either you can interpret it as unity in diversity / political maturity of voter or the inevitability and gullible mindset on the other hand. Individual states formed on linguistic basis with distinctly different cultures , the anger of south Indians for being bracketed madarasis is well known, but cultural intermingling is very common at borders and they live together or fight at times for preference for a particular language /river waters with neighbours for ages hurting /killing each other. Paradox /natural consequences at the time of unequal distribution of assets? The regional parties of neighbouring states may be different but contiguity might be a binding factor but either for larger interests of their own states or ideology(however rarely) regional party of a neighbouring state joins  a National(!) alliance.Then we all have greivance against our rulers and neighbours and still live together. Peaceful co existence and harmony or what else can we do?The list is endless.... State boundaries are already drawn and within a state there can be diversity and they do make a difference in terms of nativity/caste/religion etc., but ultimately the policies and their implementation would be broadly on generalized policies of 'State Government" ..Then you have LOCAL BODIES and they have to be strengthened if politics should address the peculiar and specific problems to a particular area.

Because the puppy mill dogs are evidence they cannot be adopted out, or put to sleep. There's no room for pets people are having to surrender.  Since the ecconomy is so rotten many more people than usual are having to surrender pets they cannot afford to feed.  The puppy mill dogs have taken away any chance of being adopted for the "regular" pets.<br>  <br>  Puppy mill dog usually have very poor health.  This too adds to the pressure and toll on human society, but usually at a more personal, family level.  Much higher than average vet bills for these dogs, and much shorter than normal life spans.

d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	Thank you for providing a question that actually points out the way those who oppose feminism twist and turn the different elements to suit their own agendas.  I could use quotes about pro slavery from men to support the belief that all white men are racists.  I am intelligent enough to realize that would be totally out of context for this era.  It doesn't surprise me because their reasoning skills and critical thinking are not very evident.|`|jER0X5OPaa	I think there are the extreme feminists who are less of feminists and more anti-men. I think some people assume they are the standard for feminists (when they really aren't) and dislike feminists for the sexist views (towards men) they believe they hold.<br>  <br>  Also, many people feel like women and men are completely equal, and that feminists are being nit-picky.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	They are motivated by the same ancient desire to control other people and claim privileges they don't deserve that has always motivated violent and selfish types.  The same attitude that slaveowners had, the same attitude that motivated wars of aggression to steal land, etc.  They honestly think they deserve more opportunities than anyone else, and gender is one more way for them to try and get it.  <br>  <br>  I'm still blown away by the ones who say "women stole their jobs."  As if it was "their" job, and they should get to keep it even though some woman is better at it and deserved the spot over them.  So much entitlement is mindblowing.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	It seems a lot of the anti-feminists feel guilty for what other men have done in the past.

Sadly, many men feel this is an attack against all men and get very defencive about women trying to protect their rights.|`|41Dwgx0Caa	After reading a hell of alot of anti-Feminist talk starting out on how much they hate Feminism and then having the subject of their hate/disdain turn on modern women, I've come to the conclusion that alot of anti-Feminists have a score to settle with women.<br>  They want women put back in their place.<br>  I can understand how they may not agree with Feminism, I don't agree with absolutely everything either, but to continuously attack women shows their true colours, even though there would be denial.|`|F6uAWBluaa	Anti-feminism today is motivated by hate, plain & simple.

To make it easy for you to understand, try and see the similarities between Fathers 4 Justice and the Suffragette movement. <br>  <br>  And you say the second wave of feminism is dead? LOL! We wish! I think you need to revisit what you have been told in Women's Studies class: Instead of acknowledging the obvious differences between the original feminists of the nineteenth century and the revivalist feminist movement that has existed since the late 1960s, some feminists prefer to divide feminism into four categories, or 'waves':<br>  <br>  First wave (late 19th-early 20th century): Seeking equal rights for women, exemplified by the Suffragettes who sought the vote for women and were against abortion. Ended in the 1920s having achieved their aims.<br>  <br>  Second wave feminism (1960s to present day). This revivalist movement focussed on what it saw as a multitude of inequalities and oppressions suffered by women at the hands either of individual men or ‘the patriarchy’. The slogan ‘the personal is political’ typified this view of every aspect of a woman’s life being subject to some kind of oppression by men. This movement has campaigned on a huge number of issues, including abortion, sexuality, and special rights for women.<br>  <br>  Post-feminism (1980s to present): a movement focussing on women’s issues that acknowledges that modern feminism has achieved its goals. ‘Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation’ by Susan Bolotin in 1982 gave a platform for women who agreed with equality but could not identify with modern feminism.<br>  <br>  Third wave (early 1990s): Really an offshoot of modern feminism that gave a voice to feminists who felt unrepresented by what were seen as the White, middle-class leaders of feminism.<br>  <br>  Does the ‘4 waves’ notion help us to understand feminism? Not really. The fact that chronologically the third wave comes after post-feminism says a lot about the validity of the waves hypothesis. The most important distinction of feminism – the fight for equality Vs the fight for supremacy – has a clear boundary in the 1960s, and from the 1960s onwards the 'second wave' has been the only aspect of feminism that has had any power or influence in the world. Indeed the other waves have had virtually no influence outside of feminist circles in academia. If anyone is in any doubt that the ‘second wave’ is the only real wave in modern feminism, they only need to look at when the most significant anti-male legislation has been created: in the 1990s and up to the present day. For example, the notorious VAWA was introduced in 1994, a decade after the supposed ascendance of post-feminism. Other such revenge legislation continues to be implemented in a growing number of countries to this day. Clearly the ‘second wave’ view of men as inherently oppressive and violent is thriving.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, the waves view of feminism gives the comforting impression that feminism was only a problem during the 1970s and ignores the fact that the ‘second wave’ protesters of the 1970s are the professors, media pundits, lawyers, judges and government officials of today who do so much to influence all of our lives.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	The realization that a third wave is not necessary.<br>  The things third wave feminists are fighting for are more human rights than they are women's rights.<br>  <br>  Props to the picture of the Kenyan feminist however..good for her.|`|un0C52G8aa	A lot of it is due to the bad economy and lack of job security. When the economy is booming, there is more tolerance for women and minorities to want to pursue lifestyles and careers that do not conform to what is expected of them by society. When the economy sours and people start losing their jobs, they start blaming others for their problems. Since women and minorities are easy targets, they are usually the ones who are blamed for them. You hear it all the time about how things would be better if women would only stay home and have children instead of competing with men for jobs or if non-whites would only go back to their traditional jobs (meaning menial work) instead of competing with whites for better paying jobs.

You can take the good and leave the bad. I definitely take feminist writings with a big grain of salt, especially when they write biographical books, just like I do masculinist writings.
