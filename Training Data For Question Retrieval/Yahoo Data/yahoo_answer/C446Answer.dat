dcKUZCnOaa	Hi, The cost of a boiler installation is in the installation not the cost of the boiler, there maybe ï¿¡300 difference that's all, i always recommend Vaillant, but as a 2nd choice if the customer is wanting to save money i use  broag Remaha, so when getting quotes always get quoted like for like. Remember you are spending money now, you do not want to have to do it all over again in 5yrs, pick your installer carefully, not on cost's alone, recommendation is best, ask Friends, neighbours, or at the school gates, Hope this helps:):)<br>   You can check boiler efficiencies at www.sedbuk.com, do not read too much into these figures because they are dependant on the whole system being up to current standards, & your installer may not work to these.|`|dp4hrRkgaa	look at the specs of every boiler you see and compare them including the price|`|cRSBRnz6aa	Just keep getting your quotes

It might seem like a waste of time, but  going the extra step will save you a real headache later on.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Depends on local codes and your HOA if you have one. The county I live in ( Brunswick County NC) will let you build a shed up to 100 sq ft without a permit.|`|0x0dabMnaa	Well... it depends. I suggest looking around your neighborhood and see what size sheds other folks have for starters. Size is important. Some pre-built sheds can be purchased and trucked in, no permit required. Many sheds built on site require a permit. In an old neighborhood I lived in once, my next door neighbor hired a service to build a shed, which they did in one day, without a permit. He never had a problem. So I decided to build a similar shed, but doing it part time, which took me a couple of weeks...  I got redflagged by the local building inspector, for not having a permit. I had to then buy a permit, and pay a $75 fine to boot. So if you want to avoid paying a fine, I suggest you go to your town hall and inquire if you need a permit to build a garden shed.|`|AA12370139	If your house is council owned then you probably would need permission on the other hand if your house is bought you probably would still need to obtain permission because there are laws for things like erecting fences(they have to be a certain height etc).|`|dp4hrRkgaa	it depends of the roofing exceeds your lot area.|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	Call city planning and ask them if you need a permit.

AA11297232	Kitchen, always keep your kitchen nice and clean. At least the person visiting will know you are clean even if the rest of the house is a bit messy.

Spritz some Febreeze about (the perception is, if it SMELLS clean, it MUST me clean will give the IMPRESSION of cleanliness!).  Also a quick clean of the bathroom is a good idea.

I would have to at least take a lysol wipe and swipe down the sink and potty, though.  If not wipes, spray some cleaner really quickly over the counter and swipe, then swipe down the potty and change the trash if it's over flowing...<br>  <br>  Tidy up living room, where she'll be sitting...<br>  <br>  then at last I would start on the dishes in the kitchen.  If you're at least washing them when she arrives, she'll just think you're casually washing dishes.

57c7bc60a4334e0eb5adcc79ec5eeb8faa	I spent 7 years in Hawaii and know there are TONS of different grasses you can grow to meet your requirements.<br>  <br>  Head to a plant nursery and take a look at the grasses they have.  (Kaneohe side if you're on Oahu) You can either seed or lay sod.  Sod might be the way to go if you have the cash and the desire for a quick lawn.  Seeding means you have red dirt available everywhere for your dogs to run through until the grass comes in.<br>  <br>  Make sure to rip up ALL your old grass before laying sod or planting new grass.  'Tilling might be advisable as well; this can help with any drainage problems as you can contour your yard for runoff.<br>  <br>  As for the mud, I found that putting in a 1' wide 3/8" or 1/2" gravel barrier around the lawn (against the fences, walkways, patio, etc) to keep the water and mud in check.  Line the barrier before the gravel with water porous material so water drains away but nothing grows up through the gravel.

Its great that you want to plan out your room on paper, thats smart!  I suggest trying one of the large furniture stores online space planning, you just take your rooms measure ments and place doors and windows, then move furniture around the room, remember to leave room for people and angles of view for TV, I like to create a little 20"circle and "drive" it through the room, this is the clearance for lower legs and knees and its helps make sure you can place your coffee table correctly.  Experiment and have fun!

Never even been there.<br>  <br>  What I know about gardening here in Pennsylvania won't do you any good there.<br>  <br>  However, with what information you gave so far I'd recommend using conifers as they need a lot of Sun and do better in poor soils though not all of them of course.<br>  <br>  And some fast spreading native ground covers that take drought so you're not looking at dirt and weeds.<br>  <br>  But I think the key word here is, the bonus of spending less money. <br>  <br>  Well, then how about you ask your neighbors to give you any extra plants from their property?<br>  <br>  Some plants can be easily divided, transplanted, dug up, establish quickly, etc.<br>  <br>  Research online native Australian plants, there may be some growing in your area that you can go out and dig up yourself.<br>  <br>  But looking into ground covers such as native grasses may be a good start. Followed by flowering bushes and then on to tall trees.<br>  <br>  I see no reason why you should need to spend a lot of money as there should be enough plants in your area that you can go bring over to your property from either neighbors or the surrounding area.<br>  <br>  But it won't happen by itself you'll need to get your hands dirty often to make it happen.

eOUW6vafaa	Short Answer: Don't spend it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Long Answer: Actually, "don't spend it" pretty much covers it. Before you buy anything, ask yourself if this is something you /need/, or something you /want/. Items you need include food, gas, and occasionally clothes (Although not in excess). Items you may want are video games, movies, and other luxuries. Don't go spending money on things you can live without. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, a trick I hear often is "Pay yourself first".

XCzpQvDvaa	you will need a water tight tank and a pump to circulate the water. Hydroponics is a method of growing planets in a water based environment were chemicals and nutrients have been added(or controlled) to improve growth rates. The water needs to be circulated so you will need a pump, and the tank itself has to be large enough that you can fit the plants into. Once you get the tank set up let the pump circulate the water and add the fertilizers/nutrients to it. you will need to rig some device up so that you can consistently deliver a sustained amount of nutrient solution into the tank, too little and the planets will not grow and too much and you will burn the roots. usually the planets float on top of the water on styrofoam boards with holes punched for the roots. Usually people use UV lights with their hydroponics because you can have light on the planets more and maximize their growth, but a greenhouse or normal light conditions will work too. It will be hard to make an effective hydroponic system from scratch, i suggest looking into buying the components you will need or cant make yourself.

3eb0DIxGaa	Short of buying new glass, or windows, no.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	I had the same problem, hubby got something at home depot, and placed it between the window and the storm window, it's a cushion and sticky and you frame the whole window. This prevents air from circulating. Sorry I don't know the name, but if you ask home depot guys I'm sure they will.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Yeah you can take the panes out clean and then reseal as you reinstall them. Sometimes throwing them away and buying new is better.|`|AA12139345	Sounds as if your windows are old enough to actually have one sash for the 'storm' window, and another for the 'interior' side of the frame.  In many cases, with the older homes, the 'storm' windows are actually metal framed windows attached to the outside of the home.<br>  <br>  The reason you are seeing the fog, is because of moisture build up.<br>  <br>  There are a few ways to combat moisture build up, between the window sashes.<br>  First, try to prevent the moisture build up to begin with.<br>  You may want to inspect the crawl space, if you have one, under the home, and see if there is a vapor barrier.  If not, then adding one will help quite a bit.  If you have a basement, then attach a vapor barrier to the underside of the floor joists.  Since you mention condensation as happening every morning, but do not mention seeing it at other times, this may be the best place to start.  I'd also caulk around the exterior of the windows.<br>  Second method is to remove the moisture, after it has gotten into the window air space.<br>  There are a number of ways to achieve this, exchange the air by opening the window (if both top and bottom sashes move, then open both a crack for faster air exchange), or use something to absorb the moisture (for example silica gel packs, or perhaps even rice)<br>  Third method is to actually replace the old windows with more energy efficient windows.  These will have argon gas, in a slight vacuum, sealed between the panes.   I will add here though, that if you have not addressed the source of the moisture prior to installing new windows, what will happen is you will get a moisture build up on the interior side of the windows, resulting in condensation - which can lead to other problems, like water damage, and mold.  The energy efficient windows will help save you money on your heating and cooling, if you tend to rely on an hvac system, as opposed to leaving your windows open year round.  If you live in an area where you can leave your windows open year round, then you would not see much difference in your bills by replacing them - you're already using the most energy efficient model, hehehe.<br>  <br>  The moisture, if you are noticing it primarily in the mornings, is from the natural process that creates 'dew' in the mornings.  Moisture is rising from the ground.  If you can prevent that from happening under your home, you can eliminate, or minimize, this process in the air space between the window sashes.  Vapor barrier will go a long ways to helping with this  (A typical vapor varrier is simply a layer of 6 mil plastic sheeting, laid on the ground, with a 6 inch overlap at the seams.)  Cross ventilation of the crawl space is important too.   Many people think it is more energy efficient to seal off the vents to the crawl space - this actually creates problems, like moisture build up, under the home.  I prefer to insulate my floor joists, and apply a vapor barrier to help mimimize moisture build up to begin with.<br>  <br>  Now, if you happen to be doing some remodeling, and the interior wall coverings are removed - that's a good time to add insulation to the wall cavity, paying particular attention to the cavities around the windows.  In extremely drafty homes, I've used expanding foam (and/or caulk) along the bottom wall plate, and the exterior wall covering, to help eliminate wind penetration.<br>  <br>  If  you run a heat source during the winter, and an air conditioner during the summer, then give some serious thought to replacing the windows.  Its a fairly large investment in a home, but it pays off in the long run.  By the same token, if you have an HVAC system that is 10 years old, or older - replace it.  There has been a lot of improvement in efficiency with the newer models.  And by all means, if you use window air conditioners, its time to upgrade to a central HVAC - it really will save you money on your electric bill.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA12206965	if you're saying there are two pains of glass and there's condensation between the panes, then the seal between the two panes are no longer working. i don't know if there is anyway to correct that problem, because i think that seal creates a vacuum. you might want to look up a window manufacturer to see what remedies they might be able to suggest.   don't be surprised if they tell you you should get the newer windows.  i've seen ads that said they will replace your old windows for less then $200.00 per window.    i had that done about 15 years ago and am quite happy that i no longer have to do any maintenance on any of them because the frames are made of vinyl. don't get aluminium window frames. they transmit cold air into the room because they are made of metal.|`|AA10834046	If they are old thermo pane windows it means the seal is broken.

Yup, it has one.  This recently happened to our unit, and we replaced it ourselves.  It's the unit that houses the clock, but contains all sorts of other electronic stuff.  Cost $125, involves leaning the unit away from the wall, removing some five screws, and then swapping in the new unit, connecting some seven or eight wires.  Do one at a time.

I'd start by trying to make someone else fix it.|`|AA11577593	depending on the make and model is on how you go about fixing it if its a frigidaire which it sounds to be it could be a few things and this is how i would narrow it down first confirm the bake element is in good looking condition look for any abscure holes in it or very very white spots, then second check to see if the broil comes on if it gets warm turn it off, pull the unit out and take off the back panel with an ohms meter which u could by a cheap one at sears foir ten bucks check to see if you get continuity thru the coil ( MAKE SURE UNIT IS UNPLUGGED BEFORE ANY TESTS ARE DONE)  if you get no continuity then boom heating element, now if you do get continuity then it could be your ERC(electronic range control) to test that merely take off both leads that are attached to the back element and insert the round prong of the ohms meter after setting it to the voltage application of 220 volts or higher and wrap both leads which will become energized as soon as you plug the unit in, turn the unit on to bake if you dont get 240 volts or 220 volts somewhere in that range, bad control. any other questions or issues let me know,.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Less than a year old??? Then it is still under warranty. Get the manufacturers to fix it.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Hello, it would help to know the make and model, also you say "your electronic stove". Is it all electric? If so the top burners are not controlled by the main control. So kind of strange that none of it is working, (top or oven). Check your breaker, half of it could be tripped. All the lights and clock will work on 110 volts but it needs both breakers 220 volts for the burners. If it is gas then it is still the same, the control has nothing to do with the top burners. So it would be a gas supply problem. Could it have been shut off somewhere?<br>  If it is not any of those few things and it is under a year old, call for service. But if it has to do with your power or gas, they will charge you. It wouldn't be covered under the warranty.<br>  Good luck and hope this helped
xRnwtN0Yaa	One thing you might need are ceiling buttons.  they are round, quarter-sized , slightly concaved disks with many little holes in them.  these are screwed into the lath at crack lines to help hold the plaster up.  Original plaster of paris is very usefull NOT THE NON-SHRINKING TYPE.    The plaster of paris when  put into the ceiling and squished under the plaster that is pulling from the lath will pull the plaster tight up against the lath as it dries.  Make only the amount you can use quickly.  Secure all loose sections.  Open cracks a bit wider than they are to accomodate the p of p which also will secure it tightly tothe buttons.  Once the ceiling is secure a top coat of thin set is usefull.  It comes in various drying times such as 45, 90, 30 minutes.  It is stronger than wall compound.  Appling in layers is better to build up to the depth of the surrounding plaster. Dampen slightly edges of open cracks before applying the mud.

They have to move in the open outside the house, but often the open is cluttered by plants and other materials they can hide in. They really do not like traveling outside where they are totally exposed. This give you an opportunity to minimize the number that come in, and maximize the number that stay out. Make sure there is an area at least a meter wide that mice will have to cross in the open to enter or leave the building, with no bushes, no debris, just solid ground or pavement.<br>  <br>  With this, your effort to eliminate food and water supplies inside will have meaning. They will still be looking for nesting materials, so keeping anything they can use that way  to a minimum is the next step. Avoid storing large amounts of paper, cloth. <br>  <br>  Some forms of insulation are perfect bedding, and will even be used for food by mice. If you have that, even mouse bait may not work.

I think that the water that you are getting may be water that is left in the line.  Turn all of your water fixtures on while the main water line is shut off. (bathroom sink/kitchen sink/outdoor tap)  If you turn the water on to your shower and the water flows from the faucet then the water is not turned off completely to the shower or anywhere else in the house. Or your main water line valve is not closing completely.  May have to have the city turn your water off until after you replace the faucets.  Unless you live out in the country.  There very well could be a hidden shutoff valve and you will not be able to replace until you stop the pressure build up.

All are cared for in the same matter.  They like bright indirect light especially in the winter, Keep it out of hot windows. They like moist, well draining, fibrous soil. Water moderately and keep humid especially in hot weather. Feed monthly during growing season. Keep winter temp above 60, only the white version can with stand temps as low as 50.  Re pot every three or four years and divide in late winter or early spring.  The Peace Lily is also know as the Flag Plant, and it's latin name is Spathiphyllum.

AA12139345	Duracell IS a good quality battery.  In a typical smoke alarm, you should replace the battery every 4 to 6 months.

At first they don't want to admit they have any plants with pests, but when I've told them I was raising insects and needing a starter colony or some such, they often sheepishly admit to just having thrown such a plant out, and I've sometimes got some good insect specimens that way.  Otherwise, look for local organic gardeners with greenhouses, those are often good aphid sources in winter.  Ladybug adults sometimes will nibble on pollen sources, too, one idea would be bee pollen.  Water is one of their biggest needs, and if there aren't any moisture sources, put a cotton wick in a test tube filled with water for them to drink from (they lick the water off the cotton, yet can't drown in the water).|`|h61UOPHMaa	Try rosebushes it's one of their favorites...

sR8rvi0eaa	Sounds like an overlay would fix the problem since most overlays can be placed from 0" to 3/4" in a single application. They also have incredible bonding strength and compressive strength far exceeding the concrete it"s overlaying. There are some limitations, mainly that it will transfer any existing cracks that are not repaired before hand. As far as brands Ardex sds or Elite Crete self leveling  are among the best I have used.<br>  I wouldn't recommend using a cheap overlay product(you get what you pay for) because delamination is major concern with the cheap stuff.<br>  As far as application goes start by Power-washing the concrete with a <br>  concrete cleaner. Most overlays need a slurry bonding coat (some of the product watered down to a slurry) or a supplied primer ( polymer)so paste that on with a stiff brush or tile sponge.Next mix per instructions and<br>  level with a gauge rake, 2by4, or 4ft level whatever is straight keeping in mind where the areas that held water are. At this point you could<br>  broom the top(you need to work fast if you intend to broom it) for traction or leave it be. You might also consider taking it a step farther and coloring the overlay to change the look. There are so many options when it comes to overlays so check out a concrete website for ideas.The material cost for a good overlay run about 2.50 Per Sq ft.|`|EnODJeIcaa	If you have low spots your best bet would be to use a repair mortar that is self leveling like Ardex 800 or  Ardex K 15...You'll want to apply some sort of adhesive to the floor first just because you are dealing with such a thin repair...But you can mix up the epoxy as per the manafacturers directions and basically pour it onto the slab (which needs to be cleaned first) and it will find the low spots on it's own.<br>  <br>  If the floor needs to look decent afterwards...in case it is going to be exposed and you want some sort of aesthetic quality besides painting it you can use a concrete dressing by Ardex like Ardex CD or CD Fine. These can be stained, stenciled, or stamped to create a pattern.<br>  <br>  Otherwise it is a matter of making sure the material is trapped on all sides, and pouring the leveling compound out and leaving it along...trying to trowel it will likely make things worse...just add the adequate amount of water and let the product do it's job.

yu9PHV4Maa	guessing you are talking about roach eggs?  Those aren't really eggs you are seeing, the ootheca is a shell that contains the eggs so the IGR won't effect them, though they will probably effect the hatchlings that get exposed to them.  Best solution would be to remove the casings manually then apply a roach gel bait in the area so that the roaches will be controlled before dropping the casings.   If you aren't talking about roaches, then never mind the above answer.|`|YY24gmRpaa	Sometimes the chemicals used in things like this can be hazardous in larger amounts or for long exposure so companies have to include these warnings for their own protection.  If someone used the Raid Egg Stoppers and later developed say some type of cancer, then with the warning the company is protected but without they could be liable for causing the cancer.   You are the one using it and it is your call where you place them, however you are also the one responsible for any problems from the placement if it is against instructions.

8apA3Rffaa	You want and need to have the top of the bottom plate that attaches to the pipe flush or a bit below the slab. I like it a bit lower to help allow any water that sets it the pan to be able to seep thru the weep holes that you see on the bottom of the top clamping ring..  Suggestion that almost nobody knows..

You want to make sure the ground is as level as possible to get the nice sleek look and to help ensure they are compacted properly or else it won't look as nice.

While I personally have handled snakes my whole life I still have a healthy respect for them. Recovering from a poisoning is never fun and almost always has some permanent health issues that go with it. Now that being said, most snakes in north America are not poisonous. Of those that are only a very few are actually life threatening. If you are afraid of it use a long hoe or shovel to carefully cut it off anywhere from the head to about halfway down its length will do. use the shovel to dispose of it. Never use your hands as the few that are poisonous will remain so for a good while after they are dead and even a nick from a dead snakes fang will cause problems. Also keep in mind that some types of snakes can get aggressive if attacked. most of the time a snake will run away from you. It will not attack anything it cannot eat unless it feels threatened. When you approach a snake, always leave it a way to get away from you. This will leave it an out if your not successful in killing it. personally I just use a long handled rake and gently pick the snake up and put it out of the yard if that is an option. I will however kill a known poisonous snake as they are all very prevalent species and this does no real harm to the species overall. just remember that most snakes will find another hunting ground if you just put them out of your yard if it is safe to do so. If you have rats or mice then your home is a prime hunting ground for them. Deal with the rat or mouse problem and the snakes will go away.|`|uUE9MY2laa	Actually snakes are all fully protected, therefore you would be breaking the law.

UrNVuFx6aa	Snakes go where there is an ample supply of food and adequate shelter to hide in. If you have birds, rodents, lizards or other small animals hanging around your house you greatly increase the chance of having snakes. By eliminating their food supply and areas where they can hide you can reduce or eliminate the snakes. Get rid of any stacks of old wood, trash, leaves, brush or unused buildings. This will get rid of most of their hiding places and a lot of their food supply. <br>  Get a cat; they eat snakes, rats, mice, lizards, birds, etc. and will lead to the snakes disappearing as well.<br>  Please keep in mind that not all snakes are harmful. Blacksnakes, king snakes, oak and pine snakes will all eat rodents and even other snakes but are non-venomous. They are good to have around, especially if you have rattlesnakes, water moccasins or copperheads in the area. <br>  <br>  If you would prefer to use other means there is a snake deterrent on the market that you sprinkle on your yard. I have not used it so I can't say whether it works or not, but you could try it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10847209	OMG-move!|`|QUlm9dtpaa	Do you have a dog or cat?

alIO8ic0aa	To give marble a quick shine, try crushing a child's stick of common white chalk into a fine powder. Dampen a clean white wash rag and dip into the chalk powder. Rub it on the marble with smooth, overlapping back and forth strokes. Allow to dry for amoment, then rinse with fresh water on a damp rag, and dry thoroughly.<br>  <br>  Marble countertops are porous and susceptible to stains, but they are not affected by heat. Seal marble with a special stone sealer to reduce its porosity, and wipe up wine, fruit juice, and other acidic food spills immediately to prevent permanent surface etching.

While many appropriate commercial cleaners are available, borax rubbed into the surface with a moistened cloth will also clean marble.

JPlVt9xYaa	My answer is a little more expensive, but my nephew has an embroider shop and we are constantly putting pretty designs over labels and stickers that people don't like. Once you own a bag, you should be able to modify it anyway you like. Some bags are very difficult to embroider over, and in those cases we embroider a design patch that is permanently attached over the unwanted decal. I know, this is an expensive answer, the cheaper way is to buy a new unmarked bag. But, who knows? You might want to try.|`|MeXHgUmRaa	I had a similar situation with a bag and stickers on it...

lLm5uIuDaa	Stripes can be as large as you want them.  Too small and you will have a very busy look.  The wider the stripe the more open the room.  Your colors are heavy so I would do no less than around a 1 ft to 1 1/2 ft stripe per color.  Determine if you want the look to be busy or more open and then lay out your pattern.  I would choose the larger.|`|AA10097817	I watched a design show today where they used a different color on different widths of stripes.

AKrTZqbKaa	Are you allergic to dogs too? I had a problem with mice, chipmunks and geese from the nearby pond. The geese were worse than the mice and chipmunks. Mice and chipmunks went after the seed. I stored the bags in a metal barrel and no more problem. The geese wiped out a field of 500 Brazilian eggplant in one day. The seeds I didn't mind but the mature plants took about 6 weeks to grow and will be hard to replace in time for a full growing season. We relocated a pregnant coyote that was injured either by a car or people believe she was shot in the hind quarter. She had 8 pups, 2 died and 6 made it. She didn't have to travel too far for food as we made her den about 50 feet from where the geese come into from the pond. She took care of the geese problem and happy to say even though she walked with a little limp in her back leg she and the pups made it. I don't feel bad about the geese because they are a dirty bird and a nuisance. This is natures way of culling a large over populated species. She also dwindled the mice and chipmunk population when she wasn't feeding the pups Goose pate.|`|WZdEdgxwaa	Sounds like your still young yet,try looking to see of this organisation is near you.Once you get used to the "farm" idea you will adjust.I grew up on a dairy farm,never adjusted to that one.<br>  <br>  Those silly cows didn't care if it was x-mass or July 4th they had to be milked.I still have vivid memories of haying season,cleaning the gutters,using the manure spreader.Hey,good luck to what I feel is a fading occupation.<br>  <br>  My Best<br>  <br>  up to this "not a depression" farmlands were being sold to developers at alarming rates.One can refer to it as anything they wish,it's still fading year by year.|`|VEk9jNWIaa	I think its great that you want to be a farmer.

Farming is not a fading occupation. America feeds the world.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	"IF" they come to your farm? They are GUARANTEED to be on a farm, that's the way it is out here in the country.

mwrSbSVuaa	Start small.  Like in containers.  If you want them in the ground, be sure to loosen the soil and add aged compost to the soil.  No matter where you plant them, they need full sun (6+ hours a day).  They like warm/hot weather.  Don't plant them until the night temps are 60+ degrees.  Water them deeply (in the morning to prevent disease.)  You want to train the roots to go deep into the soil for water.  Trellis or cage them when you plant them, not later.  This way you don't have to worry about "training" them as much.  Mulch them with red plastic.  Idk why, but they really do better with this red plastic under them.  (There have been studies and we tried it last year, it DOES work!)  Fertilize them when they flower and again when they begin to get a good fruit set (when they get some green tomatoes on the vines).  We prefer organic compost "tea" (put some compost in an old pillowcase and tie it shut.  Put it in a 5 gallon bucket, add 1/2 a bucket full of water and let it sit overnight.  What you have in the morning is nutrient rich brown water or compost "tea".) You can use miracle gro or an organic fertilizer mix, too.  If you fertilize to much more than this, you will end up with a beautiful green plant, with VERY little fruit.  During harvest time, check them 2x a day, morning and night because they will ripen that quickly and may split if you water them and then it gets hot outside.  If all else fails, go to the library and check out a Jerry Baker book or Ortho's guide to Vegetables, Fruits, and Herbs.  They are great!!!  Happy gardening!|`|bc2c20578f51c5d8576556ddbba6f0a2aa	are you planting in the ground or container planting?<br>  <br>  if planting in the ground put 1T of epsom salt in the hole before you plant. when flowers form water with 1T epsom salt to 1G water. when fruit forms water with same mixture again. it's said to encourage a better crop. <br>  <br>  they like the sun. trellis or cage them to give support and keep them from falling over on themselves. <br>  <br>  plant a marigold between or next to the plants to ward of pests. <br>  <br>  you can also mix in/till in fire place ashes. it's good for plants.|`|AA11637393	Plant them in full sun.  Water well - fertilize with Miracle Grow|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Lots of sun and water in the morning ,early. U'll need stakes for when they get bigger, you take strips of clothe and tie the vine to the stake. Tomato plants are real easy to grow but take a long time, almost the end of summer. Don't throw the green tomatoes out, slice and fry them up there delicious. Have fun.|`|f878535d0bae9326cb1189369fe41c5caa	Till your soil first, if you dont have a tiller, use a hand shovel. 2 Get yourself a bag of top soil to mix w/ the tilled dirt . 3 plant your tomatoes, if you choose to use fertilizer, wait  2 days to use it.

AA11498082	Sorry Timele - according to the Roundup label you can plant within 24 hours of application.  R-up is Systemic, does not harm the soil.<br>  <br>  Stumps will be a problem, agree professional help for that.<br>  <br>  Cover the weeds with 7-9 layers of newspaper (wet it as you lay it for a bit more control) then cover with pine straw.  Covered weeds will die - lack of light.  Weed seeds deposited on top of the pine straw will germinate, but they're easy to pull.|`|LccYp7M6aa	If you are unable to pull the weeds yourself hire some one, like a landscaper. You can use chemicals like Round up but then you need to make sure no animal or person comes in contact with the area. You will also have to wait at least three weeks before planting anything in the area, there's also the danger of getting the spray where you don't want it and killing off what you want. Stumps can be killed off with Specially made chemicals like Stum Remover after you drill a large, deep hole in the stump ,but again it dangerous around people and animals. Landscapers can remove the stumps from the area without the use of chemicals.|`|hc1fsgDWaa	There are several products on the market that you can spray on the weeds to kill them.  Just be careful that you do not get "total vegitation" killer unless that is what you are looking for. That will kill everything in its path.   If you know what it is you are looking to get rid of you can look on the bottle and see which spray is right for you.  Once you have the pine straw down most of them will not come back (as long as you lay down a nice think layer of the straw)<br>  Good Luck!|`|vkw45Jecaa	Yes i agree roundup wil work well on weeds  but for the small trees and brush you can cut them off and just apply brush killer to the fresh cut off branches .

djzxRIDoaa	Buddleia davidii, or buddleia alternifolia, can be cut to the ground each spring but need not be.  Now is not too late, at least in zone 5, where I live.  You could try pruning just for shape now and see how that goes, or you could wait until new leaves start to show and just prune out the dead wood.  By the way, this time of year all of mine look dead, too, but they're not.<br>  <br>  If it's too big for the spot, prune it down low.  Personally, I like the way it gracefully arches when it's left alone.  I just prune out dead wood, and also lop off the flowers when they're done.  This is a great flowering plant for late summer, and the hummingbirds and butterflies are all over it.|`|LccYp7M6aa	Judy H is right on the money with the trimming and pruning.

y8b86tTEaa	Damn, I never understood why some oversensitive people, when seeing knife or gun related question immediately assume the asker wants to commit violent act(s). Why such a limited perspective on  other people?<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer the question. The simple fact is that most of the knife crimes including murders and stabbings are committed with kitchen knives, not with expensive combat or custom blades. <br>  That should give you an idea.<br>  <br>  Knife length obviously plays the role, anything over 3" will be dangerous and potentially lethal in that area.<br>  The chest bone provides very good protection to the heart. <br>  Thinner blades can break on human bones.<br>  <br>  You see a lot of BS in the movies, especially when it comes to weapons, but fact is that kitchen knives are the most popular in knife crimes, and as far as stabbing wounds, go screwdrivers are very close to the top too.<br>  <br>  Which is exactly why banning combat or collectors knives will never affect actual crime rate.

f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	First, they could be breaking the law by keeping a wild animal as a pet so they will need to check the law on that in the city they live in.  He might be better off at a wildlife rehab. Secondly just because he hasn't bit anyone yet, doesn't mean he won't. Squirrels can inflict some serious damage with their teeth and claws.  Probably best to let a wild animal remain wild.  Some animals can learn to associate people with food, so they expect to obtain their food from people, rather than finding it themselves. Also, some people feed animals with unhealthy foods, which may make them ill or even kill them. Some animals can also become very unfit and overweight due to this diet.  Hope everything works out for them and for the squirrel!|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	Yes, it could be a problem. They're cute as babies but they're still wild animals that can turn on you in an instant. I have known a man who kept a squirrel and that's what happened.

It just ran into his house when he opened the door, and it was completely tame. It would actually sit on his shoulder while he went around town. Then one day it disappeared and never came back.

0wM8M5FDaa	I would not think the forklift would crush the drain pipe.If they are laid correctly they would be about three feet underground. Normally, if you have a broken drain pipe then the waste would stop at that point. Is your grass greener at that spot then other area's? How long has the grass been dead at that spot? There is a chance the heat from the forklifts exhaust could have killed that area. Wait until growing season comes and see if grass returns. If there is no problems with backups in your drains then you are fine for now. If you have problems later you<br>  can have a plumber check it out.

Couple this signal directly to the water inside the pipe.

Listening for the sound of the oscillator, follow the route the pipe takes, leaving markers of some kind on the ground. Regards, Larry.

It is cheap, but it works great.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	All a clear plastic tablecloth IS is a piece of plastic.

This is a major violation of health department codes?|`|rSIF5jtSaa	That would be bad for it. Because, if it's the dirty water draining out, there's not just soap but, greese and food in there. It will kill your plants or, they won't do so well. Not to mention, that soap would probably do more harm to your plants than good.|`|CXaCUJ5naa	That much laundry detergent will not only keep the bugs out, but it will stop the veggies from growing. Even if you had some growing there, do you honestly want to subject your family to food poisoning? <br>  <br>  The only good soapy water for a veggie garden consist of 1 table spoon of Ivory dish soap to 1 gallon of water. It's good to spray on aphids especially on roses & vine type Vegetables. <br>  <br>  You need to move the pipe.

Tell them its not a total renovation, but just small things like a fresh coat of paint, some new decorations, etc. They should understand if what you are doing is mostly DIY.<br>  <br>  The Room:<br>  Your room should reflect who you are. From the list of bands you gave me I can tell you are very outgoing and you want your music themed room to reflect that. So for paint, pick out a bright color. I suggest a bright blue such as the color Utah Sky at this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.benjaminmoore.com/bmpsweb/portals/bmps.portal?_nfpb=true&_windowLabel=contentrenderer_1_2&contentrenderer_1_2_actionOverride=%252Fbm%252Fcms%252FContentRenderer%252FgetDirectContentLink&_pageLabel=fh_explorecolor&contentrenderer_1_2%7BactionForm.nodePath%7D=public_site%2Farticles%2Fapplication_article%2Fapp_colorsampleorder_wet&contentrenderer_1_2%7BactionForm.currentNodeId%7D=%2FBEA+Repository%2F8005&contentrenderer_1_2%7BactionForm.currentNodePath%7D=public_site%2Farticles%2Fexplore_color%2Fec_color_samples_palette" rel="nofollow">http://www.benjaminmoore.com/bmpsweb/por...</a><br>  <br>  May seem kind of daring, but trust me it will look good! So paint maybe two walls that color and another two walls a bright green.<br>  <br>  So the wall color is done. Now you need to incorporate your personal music style. Now by this I don't mean cluttering your wall with posters of your favorite bands! Here is an idea- find tons of pictures of some of those bands in magazines, on the computer, maybe some old posters. Cut out specific parts of the picture and glue them onto a huge piece of cardboard or posterboard to make a collage. Make sure the whole posterboard is covered. Make multiple posterboards or cardboard peices. Hang them on your wall. (Walmart has some big posterboards).<br>  If it is within your budget, you can buy more paint (in smaller cans of course) and paint the names of the bands you like on your wall. But be warned, if you stop liking a band, you will have the name of the band on your wall forever! If this is to risky, or not within your budget here is another decorating idea. Write the names of your favorite bands on seperate sheets of colorful paper. tape string to each paper and hang them from your ceiling.<br>  <br>  Now I know you don't like links, but here are some just to give you a basic idea of some other DIY projects or some cheap finds:<br>  <br>  Storage Bins<br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Fabric-Storage-Bin-Dark-Medium/dp/B0015E4HFE/sr=1-1/qid=1236633957/ref=sr_1_1/175-8965122-4682931?ie=UTF8&frombrowse=0&rh=k%3Astorage%20bins&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Fabric-Storage-Bin...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Curtains<br>  <a href="http://www3.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=66047&CatID=67734&GrpTyp=STY&ItemID=1520477&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=66047%7c67366&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=6&CmCatId=66047|67366|67734" rel="nofollow">http://www3.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck! I really hope I helped :)|`|F7EhEYSYaa	Ask them. i made a deal with my parents. ( If they paid for everything i couldn't t pair for- which was a lot- I would do almost everything by myself) <br>  K, i LOVE your music tastes ( and you should check out Muse, Radiohead and Jimmy Eat world) <br>  <br>  Maybe like an aqua green? Turquoise? <br>  Stencil Designs are awesome. My room has like old albums on the walls ( my rooms like a dark green with gold) and Leaf stencil designs<br>  I have like a Radio in one corner, surrounding a beanbag chair, my i pod deck is there too, and a boombox ( from like when i was in 1st grad, im about the same age as you) and tons of cds in a bookcase.<br>  Then my bed, and  the other side of my rooms filled with books.|`|rV1A7K3jaa	Well start at the beginning.  <br>  as for your parents,  there really isnt a good time to ask them.  just come flat out and say it, because trying to get them at a good time is hard and frustrating.<br>  <br>  next, the dasign...<br>  obyiously u could use some posters.  walmart always has a poster rack with popular themes.  look there, cus they are cheap<br>  next, move your furnature.  it has nothing to do with the style, but will give you the feeling that you have changed the room.  <br>  also, if you have like guitar hero or rock band, make room so that you will have the floorspace for a good riff.<br>  a dark throw blanket for your bed would help, and put posters on the ceeling as well as the walls.  if you excentric, cover the walls with posters, but assure ur parents ull use tape.<br>  arrrange the room the way you want it, and also cool is a floorchair, like a beenbag or short foldout chair.<br>  last, have a mirror in your room.  again idk y but it looks cool with the rest.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/images/080108-punkhouse2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolhunting.com/images/080108...</a>
