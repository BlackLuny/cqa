20090307021548AAoyf3k	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Wise to Buy a Condominium?	I have worked hard the last few years and saved a nest egg of $100,000.      I am wondering what to do with the money? Buy a condominium or just pay rent somewhere? Additional things I wonder:      1) The money I put into the condominium is money I could eventually take out in the future? This is considering that I may want to own a house. I want to build upon the money I have so that I could eventually buy a house and not simply burn through money by paying rent somewhere. Is the understanding of this correct?      2) Because of the economy right now someone said, "I think it would be wiser to rent. If there is the chance that you may need to sell in the next year you might run into a problem selling fast for as much as you paid, if the market gets worst." So is it better to simply rent right now and wait on buying a condominium? Or is it a good time to buy a condominium?      3) What's the difference between a Condominium and a Townhouse?      Look forward to feedback! Thanks!      Jason

However, because my wife did not have a SSN at that time, IRS did not send us any stimulus money (not even $600 for me with valid SSN).  This year we plan to file as married filling jointly again, but my wife will have a valid SSN.  So, can you, please, tell me if we will get $1200 of stimulus money or not.       I tried the Recovery Rebate calculator and it only says that we suppose to get $600 back. To me it does not make sense.  I thought, because we did not get any money last year (stimulus money), then we should be eligible for a full amount ($1200).      Can someone explain this for me.      Thank you.

Thanks?	I am applying for a graduate position and would like to know if this Cover Letter is any good. Thanks:         Date         To Whom It May Concern:      Re: Junior Marketing Graduate      I would like to apply for the full time Junior Marketing Graduate position, as advertised through Seek.       I recently completed my Bachelor of Commerce (Marketing) degree from X University with a distinction GPA. Throughout the course of my studies the School of Marketing at X University recognised my high level of academic achievements. I strongly believe my scholastic performance is due to my passion toward marketing and as a result I hope to establish a solid career within this field.      Over the course of my degree I was able to expand and develop my academic and practical marketing skills through interactive group projects, presentations and work experience opportunities. Most recently I was involved with the proposal of a marketing and public relations campaign for the Asthma Foundation.      One of the most crucial requirements for a marketerâs success is outstanding communication skills. Consequently, I have excellent verbal, written and interpersonal communication skills. Furthermore, I take a lot of pride in my work through being highly attentive, extremely well organised with exceptional decision making and problem solving abilities. I am also able to display the same level of competence whether I am working within a team environment or independently.       Due to my forward thinking nature, I have the ability to use initiative and act proactively, while efficiently managing my time. In addition, I am well experienced in administrative duties due to my previous position as an administrative assistant and customer service agent. I am also extremely proficient with computers as I have an advanced understanding and knowledge of many computer applications.       I am very enthusiastic and excited toward this challenging and motivating opportunity to gain solid industry experience in exchange for my high calibre academic skills. I believe my determination and drive for success, combined with my unlimited potential and willingness to learn and develop my skills and knowledge makes me an ideal candidate for the Junior Marketing Graduate position.       Please find attached a copy of my resume, academic transcript, a letter of recommendation and letters of recognition. I would be very grateful for the opportunity to meet with you. I look forward to hearing from you soon.         Yours sincerely,            My name

I was a shift supervisor a position that I reluctantly accepted in the first place. I worked in this area for over two years, as the do and  do nots  were constantly changing and the work load was increasing the stress and frustrations were building. Before I actually quit I was and had been for months doing two peoples job with no pay increase. I was so overburdened but needed the job so I accepted the overload. I am too passive I know, but I finally stepped up to plate and advised my manager that I had no desire to continue as a supervisor. Well this presented a problem, I worked the next two days and then I had my days off. When I returned to work my manager had a letter of suspension for job restructuring. She gave me a three day suspension on the terms that she would call me in a few days with futher updates. At that time I was insulted and angry so I made the decision to quit. Now I have scared my record I don't know how to approach this. Help

20090307054343AAzi4pW	Business & Finance;Insurance	Is it normal for an insurance company to investigate your personal life?	We had a theft last year days before we moved (there were no problems, claim was paid promptly)  then just months later, the movers drop our stuff in the ocean during our move.  Again, no question about the actual incident.  I have been with my insurance 15 plus years and they agreed to take the claim.        Months later, lots of stalling, they flagged the account for a duplicate item that they thought was previously reported stolen.  I proved we had more than one when they sent an investigator out.  I thought all was good, then suddenly they are calling me and asking me about my bankruptcy years ago, (that I did tell them about) and about my eBay accounts and  past claims which we couldn't remember anymore.  Then I noticed they are looking at all of my websites including the business of my husband.       I am really hurt and angry that they are treating us like this but my mom said it is normal, that we are just paperwork and all claims are handled this way.  Others are telling me that they are doing this to get out of paying claims because of the economy.  I have to admit, I have been searching the web and found all kinds of horror stories like mine where they did all the same stuff to people who were loyal, even past employees.  I have always loved my insurance company, everyone has always been so nice and I always felt they would know we were good people and certainly would never try and screw us. I was defending them up until recently.   But now I dont know what this is about.        Is it normal for them to go into your personal life?  What is the point of that? The rep said she is just doing her job but why check our websites and bankruptcy papers from years ago?  There is too much proof and too many major companies involved in the damage for them to think we staged it, and they saw the damaged stuff first hand.   Everyone is telling me to get a lawyer and to draw the line but I just think that would make us seem like we are hiding something, so I keep giving them all the stuff they ask for even when I feel it is invasive and hurtful.       What is the purpose of all of this and should I take it personal and do something about it??

This might me the most common question someone would ask- how can I make money?..Well there are may but they are scams.   I am looking for websites that are really going to pay me and no scams.

Eg- Create an ad for $30 and get $1 per click.      I am willing to donate my time in it. I don't want huge payments, around $20-$50 per month will do, but it should be worth my work.   yes, I know that most of them are scams.

20090307064638AAGTwMI	Business & Finance;Credit	Is a payday loan not paid back considered a felony?	We live in Virginia.   My husband took out a payday loan for 500.00 to help us get thru the holidays, etc.   when it was time to pay it back, I called and told the compnay that we would need to make payment arrangements on it cause things had come up that prevented us to pay it back all at one time.  She said to stop payment on the check and then they would contact us to see when we could pay the first payment back.   It really did slip our minds and we got a call about 2 weeks ago asking if my husband knew it was a felony to not pay it back, etc and that they could only have it paid off in one payment.   I am needing to know in Virginia, is it considered a felony and if he is willing to make payments on this, will they accept them even if it is not the full amount at one time?  thanks for the help.  We are really scared of the felony charge as we are in the process of adoption and don't want our chances ruined due to a felony for this.    We are not irresponsible people, we just hit bad times with health probs and medicines that had to be bought and can't pay it all at one time.

We just had our inspections done and found that the septic system needs at least $1000 of work.  We have a buyers agent who came up with an addendum to our contract that states the seller has to fix it before we move in for us to actually buy the house.  The problem is that when we read the addendum we decided if someone sent it to us, we'd be rather irritated.  It's not a very friendly thing.  We want to contact the sellers directly to work something out with them for the septic so they don't feel like they are getting screwed and we don't either, and we would then put whatever we agree upon into the addendum.  Can we contact the seller directly, or is that a big no-no?

20090307074656AATs6mg	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Renting leased apartment?	My mother has been looking for a new apartment because she currently lives in an apartment on the second floor of a family house and the tenants who live on the 3rd floor, have children running and jumping around pretty much all day everyday. she's spoken to the landlord and he basically does nothing, so she has no other choice but to move out. Now the problem is that, she's been looking for a apartments for a while now and finally found one. She had to give 1 month security and half of first month's rent [1,100]. so the total would be $2,200, she and the landlord agreed that she can give him 2,000 and owes a balance of $200. He also made her sign a 1 yr lease. Here is where the problem is, my brother and I recently saw the apartment for the first time and the apartment is horrible for her, there is people working in the apartment and fixing it up, but from what my brother and I have seen, there's no effort being put into it.       My question is, would our mother be able to get her money back even though she signed a lease ? the landlord hasn't given her the keys yet and said she would have to move in by the 15th of this month. So does that mean her lease begins on the day she moves in or the day she signed it ?
