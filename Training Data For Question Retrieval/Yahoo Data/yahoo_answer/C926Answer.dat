agwxFmITaa	I've bought about 100 things from Ebay and have never had a problem.  Quite a few things were from abroad as well.  They have a new system where the sellers can't leave bad feed back to buyers until after the buyer has put their feedback in.  Sellers want 100% good feedback so if you did have a problem they would sort it out quickly.  And you should only deal with people who have a lot of good feedback - which you can look at before you deal with them.|`|3HtZnFEpaa	I've bought a ton of stuff from ebay and have learned quite a bit about buying from reputable companies.  Now, I only buy from companies that have a positive rating of 94% or above.  You might think could limit the possible vendors you could buy from, but the best have a high ranking and it will save you time and frustration in the end.<br>  <br>  Before I bid on an item, I not only look at a seller's rating, I also visit their website and search their name on Google (in quotes).  I'm looking for any negative feedback they may have.  If the first dozen results are either related to their website or positive reviews, then you can trust that you'll have a positive experience.

If you sell or refinance in the next 6 years and 10 months, you should not have done this refinance. Beginning on the 6th year and 11th month,  the new mortgage starts to save you money. (Your old mortgage is further into its 30 year amortization and the new loan starts over at 30 years,too).|`|AA10886262	no that would not be worth it....besides you probably don't have 30 years left on your current mortgage so re-financing for 30 years will extend the payment and you will end up paying more....now if you want to refinance for  4.5 percent, max 1 point and go for a 15 year mortgage you could very well save money.....but you could also do that by paying additional principal each month....find a mortgage calculator...bankrate.com has some good ones and run your numbers.....I think you would be better off just paying more principal..but run the numbers|`|mQg5SVQXaa	No, you already have a very low fixed rate.

(The fact is, that if there's a tax lien, the lien holder is limited by the court as to what, how much and when they can seize assets. A change in ownership would not likely change anything.)
51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	There's no reason not to buy on ebay.  Just check the feedback of your seller--anything over 100 is usually enough to indicate it's not a scam.

QdtppqFPaa	Right now, the minimum credit score almost any lender will need to even consider an FHA loan is 620.  This is only for first time home buyers (any one who has not owned a home in the last 3 years).  Depending on how bad your mom's credit is, you may look for a lease to own home.  Many times the owners of these homes will want money up front (like a downpayment) and will a apply a certain percentage of your monthly rent for a predetermined number of years toward the remainder of a downpayment.  This will give you time to build credit and your mom time to repair hers while living in a home you will eventually purchase.|`|3vwvLWrHaa	You have just discovered the reason for the housing crisis.<br>  People who can't afford to buy houses need to rent!<br>  Credit is a means to purchase that which you can not afford!|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I think there are so many cheaper homes and condos on the market that you would probably be likely to afford, if you have a full time job.  If your mom has bad credit, she would get a loan with a higher interest rate, unless she has foreclosed in the last couple of years.  If you have any credit cards, then you should have some credit.  If you don't, its time to apply for one and then be responsible with it, always pay it on time, keep a balance, so you can show you can pay on it, don't keep the balance near your credit limit.  That is a red flag that you can't you've over charged.  Never go over your credit limit.  Develop your credit and I bet you can get a loan for a small home or condo, especially with all the available foreclosures.  Good luck.|`|WLrmkMDyaa	Get a credit card from local bank and pay it in time.

We can see that those people should have known, that they couldn't afford the homes, and would foreclose, so who cares for their loss, but what no one seems to look at is the trickling down to the responsible home owners who are left.  We are the ones who paid extra on the mortgages, for homes not worth what we've paid on them.  What about the ones who can't sell them, can't refinance them, and really, for the first time, are trying to decide to foreclose because the $250,000 new house we just bought, and put $50,000 down on, is now worth $100,000, because of all the foreclosers, due to the interest only loans to people who couldn't afford them.  So who caused this?  The banks and the laws that let them do this.  So, how do we solve this?  The banks didn't break any rules, we can't punish them.  Why didn't the lawmakers do anything to prevent the banks from giving out these types of loans to people who couldn't afford them.  In my eyes, the only ones laughing are those who got the interest only loans, lived there a few months, without paying on the mortgages and then left, and ofcourse, the banks, who got the $50,000, down payments, on the houses that aren't worth anything.  People have lost their life savings.  So those who got screwed are those who saved and those who didn't.  Ironic, huh, I remember the story of the Ant and the Grasshopper.  I don't remember the grasshopper making out...

It is usual practise (although I think it is laziness on the part of the lenders) to write to the person whose name appears first on the account, this however does not mean that they have relieved the second named person of their obligations.<br>  <br>  As far as marital separations are concerned, even if you both agreed that one of you will take over the loan, this agreement will not come into effect until the lender agrees to it and removes the others name from the loan account as you can't unilaterally change the terms of the agreement.  The same is true of the variation to any of the terms, such as how much is being offered as payment compared to how much is due.  Given the current economic situation, I dare say that most lenders will like to increase the chances of being repaid by spreading the risk of default by keeping two people on the hook rather than changing the account to a single name.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if this is not what you want to hear.

QZEDisIsaa	If your name is on the lease he can't force you out.  If his name is on the lease and he moves and refuses to pay, you can sue him.  Which is what I suggest you do.  If he has a problem, let his *** leave.  His name is on the lease, he's still obligated to pay unless the landlord wants to let him out of it.  Tell him if he has a problem he needs to be the one to leave, you have a child who needs stability and is more important.  If he refuses to pay and his name is on the lease, take him to court and they will make him pay.  And no, if you are on the lease and you did not consent to it he can't rent your daughter's room out.  Tell him to hit the pavement, he's an immature *** who isn't ready for the real world.  Good luck.|`|42f5c8ec4ecb6ece9bb20f48e5dfe636aa	He cannot legally evict you, only the landlord can. Both of you share equal responsibility as far as rent because leases generally state that you are separately AND jointly responsible for the contents therein. <br>  <br>  If he fails to pay rent, the credit ding or the resulting eviction notice will be equal for both of you, so let him know that. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day, though, you don't want to live with a guy that doesn't want to be with you, or undermines the stability you are trying to establish for your daughter. It is healthiest to move out of that situation. <br>  <br>  I'm just one opinion but here's what I would suggest: If on a month to month, find a way to move out, take your name off the lease and stick him with the entire rent. If you were stuck in a 1-year lease, tell the landlord exactly what is going on with the ex's threats, continue paying your portion of rent directly to the landlord (so you have proof) and if you get evicted because the ex fails to pay his portion, take him to small claims court or suggest to the landlord that they do. <br>  <br>  Regardless, read up on "Landlord Tenant Laws" for your state. It sounds like this lazy bastard isn't going to research anything at all, so you have an opportunity here to scare him with legal-speak and the research that you do. ;-) Good luck!|`|5QlS4bmeaa	The him to court i agree with the first person who responded to the question. He's an *** and a dick. yes if you both signed the lease he cant kick you out, no can he rent the room without your consent. but i do advise, you is, and i mean IF there is any violence in the house and the 911 is called, watch because you have a child in the house.|`|yHl7RIuOaa	You have signed a lease agreement with landlord not the other tenant. This other tenant may not force you to leave. In fact the landlord cannot force you to leave either without asking a court to do it. And a court us unlikely to do that if you are paying rent and a single mom.<br>  <br>  You have the same legal interest in this lease as your boyfriend does.<br>  <br>  Plus the landlord is not going to release you from the obligation of paying rent. So even if you moved out because your bf asked you to, the landlord will still require you to pay rent.<br>  <br>  You,this guy and the landlord need to sit down and talk to find out what is possible. Will the landlord release you if this other guy assumes 100% of the rent?<br>  <br>  Please make sure you receive any promises in writing.|`|ARaOShgzaa	As everyone has said he can not kick you out. If you are both paying rent continue paying your part of the rent and keep proof that you paid. If he doesn't pay you can take him to court over it. The landlord will not be happy if he does not pay rent.  Both of you signed an agreement and the landlord can take him and you to court if he doesn't pay. I would try to find another place or have the guy pay the rent for the month and leave. You should probably sit down and inform the landlord about what is going on. You have a daughter you have to take care of and you don't want to get dragged down if this guy decides not to pay his part of the rent.
p3vjvzRPaa	Off the top of my head...<br>  <br>  Problems with publicity are: Why would they run your story?  What's news worthy about it?  Would your market (theater producers) read it?

Ratty carpeting will indicate 'poor maintenance elsewhere', as well as give a poor impression.<br>  <br>  Second, if YOU replace, you get to control costs.  When you offer an allowance, buyers somehow expect $35/yard for carpets, and $50/hr for painting.  Once you install the new carpets, it takes an expert to determine the quality and cost of what you have put down.<br>  <br>  Bite the bullet and handle these issues prior to showing the house.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	you'd be better off either recarpeting yourself or even (cost considering) putting in laminate or pergo flooring and doing the painting (depending on how bad the paint job is now).  an allowance is well and good, but you might not ever get to the point of getting an offer if all the carpets are in terrible shape...especially in this buyers market.  potential buyers will simply move on to another place that is more turnkey than yours.

I work for a bank and when I was a personal banker we were required to do an X amount of cold calls a day. so as long as I had a reason and knew what i was going to say  before I called it turned more into a courtesy call than a sales call bc they had thousands of dollars in a regular savings and when i called them to tell them they could a larger interest rate that would really make a difference they were happy i called because they didnt know about that product we offered and in the end it was more helpful than just trying to get the sale. <br>  <br>  in fact a lot of my success came from my calls its all about being coached and lighting that fire in the employees to show how cold calls can be successful.  <br>  <br>  I am now a manager he is known for being a great coach sales wise.<br>  <br>  plus with it being a business that you are calling they should expect those things and if they get the right pitch thrown at them that is confident and secure they should bite if it truely benefits the company to have that product...<br>  <br>  really emphasize on how you are there to help them and offer the best thing fit for them so that they see that you are not just trying to make a share but make their business better by the product you are selling

What you have not factored in to this is that debt is risk.  If it were such a great idea, we would all be doing it and living of the banks.  What happens to your plan when you have an emergency and can't make a credit card payment and you get is with a penalty and your rate jumps 27%?  Does is still sound like such a good idea then?  Not to mention that those 0% teasers usually apply to purchases and not cash advances.  Then there is usually a transaction fee of 3 to 4% of the amount of the advance.

xDdhUldraa	First thing first, contact your state business authority and get your license.  Take it slow.  Grow and be careful on who you pick as clients.  Eventually you will be able to branch out.  When you are not getting any sleep at night because you have too many orders then you know you have done something right.  <br>  <br>  Once you get started and depending on your value and quality, you might be looking for insurance.  Also, as a start up, you can get cheap business cards at vistaprint.com.  Finally, contact your local phone directory and get in the yellow pages fast.  I recommend a year or two at dex and once you establish, you can look at the other books.  Also, when folks come in and want you to have your business at the top of some map, skip that one!  Good money after bad.  The best advertising other then word of mouth and then dex exposure for me has been pens with my business info stamped on it.  Freebies are nice that way.  Also, I started out using a cricket phone for my business with unlimited local at first.  Once I was able to afford it I upgraded to a better service with more bells and whistles but ported my number over.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you get internet exposre.  Get a good business name like growing up with flowers.  Use a free yahoo address that you can forward with later.  Also, as soon as you can afford it, buy your domain name at like godaddy.com until you can establish yourself.  Once you develop your web page, go to someone like mister.net for webhosting at first.  They are cheap and give good service for a cheap yearly rate.  Don't be scammed on getting a web mail interface with them.  That is expensive and not needed when you can use an application like web2mail.com to check your email.<br>  <br>  Lots of ways to started.  Look for the cheapest I posted here.  I use all of those tactics (isn't it funny if you reverse tactics you get tic tacs?  Ah the early morning hours of silliness have arrived.) I listed.  Find out what the cheapest and most effective is and use that to get started.  The business license is the most important.  That gets you sales tax exempt product that you can later incorportate into your projects.  Also, people prefer to do trade with a legitmate business. <br>  <br>  Finally, once you get started, don't plan on much of a financial lift from your business for the first few years.  I have been running for the past 5 years and I don't expect to see any real cash flow until this year now.  For the first year I only lost 17k.  The second was only 12K the third was 7K and (I haven't done my taxes for last year yet) I only hope to have lost about 4k.  All of that is write offs though.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  It is worth the effort if you want to watch something small grow into something big.

The one that I've had the most success with however is the following:<br>  <br>  1.  Do a search for keywords related to your website on Google.  Try to use the most competitive keywords which you can get from keyword related software or simply by looking at the number of competing pages listed in the upper right-hand corner of Google.<br>  <br>  2.  Start with the 4th search engine result and put the name of each website in a spreadsheet.  I like to take from the #4 position to the #20 position.<br>  <br>  3.  Eliminate those URLs that are for ezine articles, blogs, etc.  You are looking for company websites.<br>  <br>  4.

XHhJ8ffRaa	Having a second job may or may not push you into an upper tax bracket depending on your total income. It's possible that your tax bracket jumps from 10% to 15% or 15% to 25% by having a second job.|`|ghQiXzOraa	Nope.  Having 2 jobs means you make more money.  The amount of taxes you have to pay to the Federal and State governments depends on how much you earned minus your expenses.  Using tax jargon, all your earnings from whatever source derived is taxable minus either your itemized deductions or your standard deduction to arrive at your taxable income.  If you have two jobs, some of your traveling expenses is considered an expense to earn the income and thus deductible.  Not all your commuting is non-deductible.  Commuting is driving from your home to your first job.  Deductible is driving from you first job to your second job.  Get a good tax accountant.
2opG5Qaoaa	In my words, collect money from the public by way of premium and invest the amount in some investments.  Pay the money on claims.  <br>  <br>  The LIC policy holder will get back the insured money either by death or on maturity of the policy.<br>  <br>  If you do not pay the installments (premiums), the risk will be covered on the life. You can discontinue paying LIC after few installments. In this case either you can surrender your policy and get back some nominal amount or to waite till maturity and get the amount paid by you.<br>  <br>  Question of benefit is very little in LIC.  If the policy holder dies after paying 2 or 3 installments then it is a benefit to the dependents.  <br>  <br>  If any policy holder is getting back the money after paying all the installments, then he will be at great loss.  <br>  <br>  For example: <br>  One of my close relative did LIC for 20 years @Rs.5305 per month for 20 years. (1985-2005). After maturity in 2005 he got Rs.1,58,000. He actually paid Rs.5305 x 20=1,06,100.  That means he has received Rs.51,900 extra after 20 years.<br>  <br>  The interesting point is that he has purchased a house plot for Rs.9000 during 1985.  He sold the plot for Rs.8 lakhs during 2005.  <br>  <br>  The employees of the LIC, the Govt. and the agents are enjoying the LIC funds. The actual policy holder is not getting the benefit.  The employees are getting higher salaries, very cheap car loans etc.,  <br>  <br>  Some how or other I hate LIC.|`|cWuumdy7aa	The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is the largest life insurance company in India and also the country's largest investor.; it is fully owned by the Government of India.

Only Chase and Citi deal directly with customers (home buyers) But Fan and Fred buy the mortgages in the secondary market. <br>  <br>  If you are shopping for Home loan, try local Credit Unions/banks you know of (you can start with the bank you have checking/savings). They will be the best ones who get you best rates. In my experience (I own 3 homes) interest rates with any lender (based on  your credit and income to debt ratio) are same. closing cost may vary between 200-500. All other conditions in general will remain same.   Therefore, who cares who is a big lender (big lender has been big looser too lately).
U3jZFawtaa	You have a tough situation. They didnt do what they said and left you hanging for months and said they were going to promote but didnt. Sounds like they were saying and doing whatever to get it up and running. They opted to give you free rent in hopes of turning it around.<br>  <br>  However a security deposit is a security deposit. The problem is that I bet the "free rent" deal was not written (its how these people operate...promise verbally then go back on it when it suits them) down.<br>  <br>  Seeing it was not written down (I'm assuming) then its your word against hers in court and it will cost you $500 of your time to try to get a judgment and most likely you wont get the money from them.<br>  <br>  So drop it and figure the $500 was for the time you were there and a big lesson learned in how to handle the next situation like this.

You contact the ones you may be interested in bidding and request that you be put on their "Bid" List.  If you are accepted, they will send you<br>  the blueprints for your building estimate (deposits required) for the phase of work you want to bid.  Bids must be placed before their deadline to be included.  The bids are opened all together, sorted and categorized.  The project is usually awarded to the best contractor with the best priced estimate.  Overseas I'm sure there is a similar process to follow.  You might try calling the Better Business Bureau to see if someone there can lead you in the right direction to get the information you need.<br>  Good luck.<br>  P.S. if you are considered to be  a "Minority" contractor, you will always have a better chance of getting a project awarded.  Of course as long as your company has a good working reputation.

Try calling the IRS to get if if your refund is less than you anticipated.<br>  A delay in funds does not always mean there is an error and is far more likely this year than any other due to the recovery rebate credit.

2N6oTOLQaa	Wow, the first two answers were pretty bad. <br>  <br>  There is no penalty for filling late as long as you don't owe. if you owe money from your 2007 taxes then you will be charged a penalty plus interest because you missed the April 15th 2008 deadline. however, if you are due a refund, there is no penalty. <br>  <br>  Filling your 2007 taxes now won't do any good toward getting the stimulus checks. However, there is a 2nd chance to claim the money on the 2008 forms. Look for a line item called the recovery rebate credit on your 2008 taxes. There is a worksheet in the instructions booklet to help you determine if you qualify for any stimulus money. If you do, you claim it on this credit and it will result in a larger tax refund (or less money owed).|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Minus penalties for filing late, you will only get it if you where eligible,|`|ug00j0S8aa	As I recall, the deadline for receiving a stimulus check based on 2007 income  was October 15, 2008.  Now you can get the stimulus payment as a credit on your 2008 taxes if you qualify based on 2008 income and didn't receive one last year (which you would not have since you didn't file).|`|WuDXQGBgaa	yes you will.
Daq9gituaa	Federal taxes will be offset first. Chances are that when you file this year it will trigger a review/audit. The information from your W-2's is also sent to the IRS so they are going to be after you to file for 2007 plus charge a late filing penalty and interest on the unpaid balance.<br>  <br>  There might be a silver lining in this dark cloud though. Since you did not file a 2007 tax return, you  probably did not receive the stimulus payment sent out in 2008. That can be used to credit your tax and or child support debt.<br>  <br>  ~|`|MvC6n3DWaa	First  IRS<br>  Second MOM.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that seems to be the deal for everything when you are a mom.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	if you owe the irs back taxes then they will take your refund first before child support.

sI3krJULaa	A- no.  While you could use a separate book depreciation for your assets and use the same method for all of them, it's not required, and it even makes things more complicated.  The simplest way is to choose either state depreciation or federal depreciation (tax) for your book depreciation.  That way, it's a simple conversion (or no conversion at all) to get to your tax numbers.<br>  <br>  B- Not technically.  But if you use a different depreciation method on the financial statements than you do for tax purposes, you have to disclose that fact.  And you have to explain your reasoning.  And that reasoning should be good.  Which is why it's easier to just use the tax depreciation in the first place.  Out of our tens of thousands of clients, we maybe have 100 who use a separate book depreciation that is more than just slightly different from either state or federal tax depreciation.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)

If someone says something is legal, and you do not believe it to be true it is probably not. <br>  <br>  Know that most real at home jobs will not be advertised. You will have to find them, due to the fact that many open positions are filled before any ads can be placed. <br>  <br>  If they are advertised, they will not start of with telling you how much you will be making. Business seeking home workers have the advantage, and do not need to waste advertising budgets telling the employees to the tee what they will get out of it. A description of the qualifications needed for the job and how to send them your resume will usually be all you will see. <br>  <br>  They should also include a business name and address, check it out with the Better Business Bureau first. <br>  <br>  Some times for very obvious reasons, they do not provide contact information exempt for a generic email. If you do sent the your resume do not be to quick to sent them any personal information. Block out identifying information exempt for you email address. In you cover page include the reason you blocked you identifying information and include that you hope to here back with them. Also include that when you have their information and are able to check them out with the Better Business Bureau then you will gladly send them the information they need. However think twice about providing a social security number, if you have never talked with them on the phone. I they do not care if they have your credentials the business is probably a scam. Same goes for if they will not tell you who they are in the first inquiry about you working for them. <br>  <br>  Remember a honest real at home job will not request any money. Any charges they will have for background checks should be taken out of your first check. <br>  <br>  If they seem to pushy, pass them by, if they are not a scam there is a reason why they are having trouble keeping employees.|`|JYyv8ob1aa	check my blog for some good work at home jobs and Proof of Payments<br>  <br>  <a href="http://workhomemoms.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://workhomemoms.blogspot.com/</a>|`|uXVKujXRaa	Hundreds of market research companies use online surveys to learn exactly what consumers want.

1dcfd1cbe002b5b4354aea9bd5db367eaa	First, a few points.<br>  <br>  If you get a job that offers group health insurance, you will be absorbed into the risk pool, and you will be able to use that health insurance to cover your MS.  Same holds true for group life insurance.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that you are referring to "affordable health insurance" for people with lower incomes or who are unemployed.  The reason I say this is that there are many private health insurance companies who will offer you insurance, but it will likely be far too expensive.  So knowing that you are in a high-risk insurance category and that you are uninsured, you will probably need some assistance.<br>  <br>  This information is excerpted from the California Guide to Finding Health Insurance Coverage (linked below):<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  If you cannot afford health care or insurance, there are programs that provide health insurance to some people who cannot afford to buy it on their own. You or your family members may qualify, even if you work. However, these programs have income and asset limits. In California, the main programs are Medi-Cal and Healthy Families.<br>  <br>  Generally, you can get coverage if you are pregnant, a parent with a child living at home, a person with a disability or a person who spends most of your income on health care. Children can often get coverage—even if their parents don’t qualify—because the income limits are usually higher for children.<br>  <br>  If you can’t afford health care, it is best to apply rather than trying to guess whether or not you are eligible because the income rules are complicated.  TO LEARN MORE, contact Medi-Cal at 1.800.541.5555 or 1.866.784.2595 TTY. If you do not speak English, you have a right to get help in languages other than English.  There may also be other programs to help you pay for health insurance. Be sure to ask about<br>  other available programs when you contact Medi-Cal.<br>  <br>  There are three [other] programs that may help you. Those programs are Medicare, Medicaid, and California’s high-risk pool.<br>  <br>  Medicare<br>  You might qualify for Medicare, even if you are under the age of 65, if you have a disability that is expected to last at least a year or is expected to cause your death. In order to get Medicare because you are disabled, you have to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and you must receive SSDI for 24 months before you can enroll in Medicare. Until that time, you will have to find another source of health insurance.  TO LEARN MORE about SSDI, call the Social Security Administration’s toll free number - 1.800.772.1213 (1.800.325.0778 TTY). To learn more about Medicare, call 1.800. MEDICARE (633.4227) or go to www.medicare.gov.<br>  <br>  Medicaid<br>  If you are blind or have a disability and your income is low or you spend most of your income on health care, you may qualify for Medicaid. People who have a disability usually qualify for Medicaid because they get Supplemental Security Income (SSI), but you may be able to get Medicaid while you are waiting to find out if you are eligible for SSI. Even if you do not qualify for SSI, you may still be able to get health insurance through Medicaid.  TO LEARN MORE about the rules and how to apply, contact the California Medicaid<br>  toll-free line at 1.800.541.5555 (1.866.784.2595 TTY).<br>  <br>  California’s High-Risk Pool for People with Health Problems<br>  High-risk pools are state-run programs that sell health insurance to a small number of people who are turned away by insurance companies or are offered very limited or expensive policies because they or a family member have an existing health problem.  TO LEARN MORE about the California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Program, California’s high-risk pool, call 1.800.289.6574 or visit www.mrmib.ca.gov.<br>  <br>  More Help Finding Your Way<br>  Because these programs are so complicated, you may want help. For example, many people are turned down for Medicare or Medicaid coverage the first time they apply. You may need to appeal this decision more than once. You may be able to get help from the following:<br>  <br>  ? You can call the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles at 1.800.399.4529 to find the legal services office that is closest to where you live. You can also check www.lsc.gov.<br>  ? State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) provide information, counseling and assistance to Medicare beneficiaries. Contact California’s SHIP, the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP), at 1.800.434.0222.<br>  ? Protection and Advocacy (P&A) programs provide legal representation and other advocacy services under all federal and state laws to all people with disabilities. In California, contact Protection & Advocacy, Inc. at 1.800.776.5746 or visit www.pai-ca.org.<br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|dgkpTirfaa	healthplans.bebto.com - try this one.

JpFYiAR2aa	Part of being a good manager is knowing contacts that will help launch the band into popularity. You have to be able to get them a record made, get them gigs by contacting local venues in your area and get them started that way. <br>  <br>  Get them into the studio. Get them to record their tracks to sell. Make a few copies and send them to independent record labels. This will help to get them exposed to people that matter in the business. Everyone somewhere, somehow, knows everyone. They will know who to get them to, if they are good. <br>  <br>  Drive their popularity in your area through the local radio stations using the album that they cut. Get them played, get them known.

It is by far the fastest crediting GPT site that I personally have found. <br>  <br>  Now, when I first found this website, and they said "Payouts in 24 hours" I was immediately skeptical. After deciding that it can't hurt to sign up for free, I realized that there was no minimum cash out, I became even more skeptical. But when the offers got approved and it showed how many points I had, I immediately cashed out into pay pal, and had the money in my pay pal account in a mere 20 minutes! Cash Lagoon also has a 15% referral program.|`|7SHXTwJmaa	I will give some opinion on this based on my experience doing this kind of things before. From my understanding there are two kind of program in this taking survey things. First one is a survey program done by real survey company and the second one is advertising platform for online company to get leads or potential customers.<br>  <br>  With the real survey program you will get very little survey invitation in a month. Maybe 1 to 2 times a month from one company. And usually you won't match the first criteria this company is asking for a respondent. Anyhow you will get bonus points for answering their first question even if you not accepted to carry on with the survey.<br>  <br>  With the other program you are offering some services usually a free  trial services. Most of the these program are targeted for US, Canada, <br>  and UK residents. If you are not from those region you will get very little offer.<br>  <br>  So basically when you are joining paid survey company you are actually joining a middle man(company) who are assembling all these 2 types of companies together in one place. This assembling company got paid when you do the survey or taking on an offer and the they pass some of the money they got to you.<br>  <br>  The problem comes when the company who are spending money to find leads or do a survey didn't pay when they found that the same people try out their free offer again and again but still not taking their paid services. And when they don't pay, assembling companies can't pay the people who do all these 'survey' and people will call them scam.<br>  <br>  So that is what online survey all about. It is like a battle between companies who want to get leads and the people who want to get quick buck taking the same free offer again and again to earn easy money for them. In the end it will only become a business opportunity to anyone who don't mind going all the trouble where some time you get lucky for getting paid and sometime you don't get paid for your time. So it just like gambling. <br>  <br>  With that said if you think you want to take the risk with your valuable time doing all that then good luck and all the best.|`|f11899af19e8fe6c17016bfc9763dd7aaa	No, its nothing but scams my Luv........... don't fall for it!!! whenever you hear anything that sounds too good to be true walk away, hang up the phone, close ur browser........ if remember that you will never be a Victim of Scams(:|`|AaVoXMidaa	not really. not much money for sure, and most payout in tiny amounts which suck.<br>  <br>  your best bet is here:<br>  <a href="http://surveys-and-emails.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://surveys-and-emails.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  those work good.|`|80b8cc51687afa4b940b8a3d2bef0a46aa	If you have a lot of time and don't expect any payment, go for it.|`|RuuDRk5Uaa	In general see there are tasks that u need to perform against the money that is promised for each tasks. the more tasks u perform more money u earn.<br>  Then there is a concept of minimum payout.

Regular data entry options are good but not very easy to find. I got a small list of some good options, see links section. Workers without experience start at $6.00 an hour and can go up to $11.00 an hour in larger cities. Experienced data operators earn between $7.50 and $17.00 an hour, depending on the field.<br>  <br>  Also there are few home based transcription work, where in you get the data in images or audio form and u need to convert them back in text form and upload. <br>  Here also you'd be competing against people from countries where the hourly rate of pay is a lot lower, so don't expect huge wages for such jobs, but still it might be good enough to start with.<br>  <br>  Also there are sites that pay you to do specific tasks like posting something on a forum, signing up for a newly launched site, or answering few questions as a survey, filling up forms.. or similar stuff, and there are amount specified for each tasks. tasks are easy, small payout is decent.<br>  here are some usefull links and resources to start with:|`|rd0syS2Haa	Dont waste your time with surveys....<br>  If your into photography or know a little graphic design try this...<br>  NO INVESTMENT- JUST PROFIT!<br>  <br>  SHUTTERSTOCK!<br>  Over Four Million Royalty-Free Stock Photos<br>  Shutterstock is the largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world.<br>  <br>  ? if you want to buy photos or illustrations - You can choose a 25-A-Day Subscription which gets you 25 downloads every day — that's 750 each month<br>  ? if you want to sell your photos or illustrations – you can make 25 cents every single time someone downloads on of your pics!<br>  <br>  Here is the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://submit.shutterstock.com/?ref=92461" rel="nofollow">http://submit.shutterstock.com/?ref=9246...</a>|`|LjCoHMKLaa	You can try this site: <a href="http://www.points2shop.com/index.php?ref=uin123648809379826" rel="nofollow">http://www.points2shop.com/index.php?ref...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know which site you saw an advertisement for, but I know for a fact that www.rewards1.com and the one mentioned above are legit. However, I highly recommend Points2Shop (linked above) over Rewards1 from personal experience. Rewards1 didn't credit nearly as often for me and I think Points2Shop has a lot more opportunities for money.<br>  <br>  At this site, you can take surveys (or complete "offers" which are very similar) and get points or cash in return. If you choose to receive points, you can use those points to buy anything on Amazon.com (100 = $1.00 and a survey is typically 70-90 points) If you choose to receive cash, you can cash out via paypal, check, etc -- there are lots of options.<br>  <br>  Make sure to read up on tips and advice to make sure your offers actually credit (there are resources on the site for this). You can search google or youtube about it -- it has a really good rep and a lot of proof. (You can choose to have your points convert to cash or use them in Amazon.com)<br>  <br>  Oh! I forgot, it's free. And you don't ever have to use your real address or anything (until you get around to ordering a reward, obviously) and you don't ever have to actually COMPLETE the trials, just click the page and wait til it loads. So basically you're getting paid to look at ads and "consider" them, though you never have to do them. <br>  <br>  I would definitely recommend this site. I've already made some quick money from it :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Failing that, try www.sba.gov. for a micro loan through a Small Business Development Comapny (SBDC) .  Finally you might call the SBAAnswer Desk at (800) U ASK SBA.  You should also consider F&F (Friends & Family).  Good luck!

Only if it's fake, or so severely damaged that either a lot is missing or you have a hard time telling what it is, do they not need to take it.  Or if you had a bucket of coins -- that generally shows that you mean to be a nuisance, not a customer.<br>  <br>  Age doesn't matter -- well, if it is REALLY old, say, 100 years or more, it might be worth more than face value and you might be silly to use it to buy something.|`|AA11215640	the money works in all states, and Yes, Walgreens will take those for payment!

The new landlord may ask you to put down extra security....or you could offer to do so.|`|AA11913070	As you are obtaining the tenancy via a letting agency, you have to be aware that some of the information you have disclosed to them is information that the landlord would not ordinarily be able to find out via references or from the searches.  Whether that information is passed on to the landlord may determine whether or not you get the tenancy.<br>  <br>  Having said that, it is up to your landlord whether or not s/he accepts you as a tenant as acceptance is entirely at her/his discretion.  To increase her/his comfort factor, the landlord may ask for a higher deposit, guarantees or previous landlord references to ensure s/he gets the warm fuzzy feeling that they get paid on time.<br>  <br>  If you have any doubts about your credit status, obtain your statutory file from the other two credit reference agencies in the UK.  It costs GBP2.00 each (rather than subscribing for their premium services).  Only then will you be in a position to know what is on your files and whether or not they are giving incorrect information as you can't assume that your landlord is using Experian.  You will then have a full picture of what any enquirer sees.  The landlord can only see what you see, no more.<br>  <br>  Each of the credit reports you receive will give you the address of the entity that put a record on your file so that you can approach them to get it amended if the record is wrong.  In the interim period, you can apply to the credit reference agency to have a Notice of Correction put onto your file which is visible to all future enquriers.  FYI, I have provided a link to the other credit reference agencies websites (CallCredit and Equifax).<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

You do not now find a job that you can do with your disability - you find a job you have the ability to do and then the employer must by law make reasonable adjustment to enable you to do the work. <br>  <br>  Your rights for redundancy are the same as non disabled people in terms of finances. However you are covered by the disability discrimination act so your employer must be seen to treat you the same as the other employees, in that for redeployment they must not take the special needs you might have and use those as a reason not to employ you. It does not mean you are entitled to a job over a non disabled person, but that your disability must not be taken as a reason not to keep you in employment.<br>  There are several charities that can give you specific advice.

I am not sure why you mentioned saving up to $500, but if it is because you are planning to pay one of them to join, please do not!<br>  <br>  All legit surveys are free. They will never ask you to pay or buy anything, so avoid those that do.<br>  <br>  First, you need to register yourself with the survey company. That means giving them your email address as a way to contact you, and your house address, as a way to confirm that you really are a legit human and as a way of sending you your check. Each time a new survey that fits your profile appears, they will send it to you by email. If you wish to do that survey, just fill it out, if not just leave it alone.<br>  <br>  I do have one tip for you though. Create a new mail and use it only for the surveys. Just in case you accidently registered with the phony ones,they will send you spam, and that way your main email is not affected.<br>  <br>  I can recommend the website that I use below if you are interested.

Zbn8A7Geaa	If they bought the home in good faith with an A.R.M. with an adjustable rate that skyrocketed recently  -- those individuals would be hurting badly now.  They cannot afford the monthly payment because of the interest rate increase.  Because of the falling home prices, they can't sell the home because it's not worth what they owe.  And they can't refinance for the same reason -- because the value of the home is now lower than what they already owe on it.|`|briRpzL1aa	It depends on the arrangement... If it is an interest only loan (ARM 2x20 for example), then the reset is what gets the person.  Meaning, they could never have afforded it in the first place..<br>  <br>  Second...

There are mortgages out there that people can buy that have either bubble payments after, say 5 years, or that are adjustable rate mortgages, that permit the mortgage company to raise the interest after a period of time. such as 5 years.<br>  <br>  They can sell these bombs to folks who "think" their incomes will be much higher in 5 years and they will be able to afford them.  5 years go fast, so when your payment goes up by hundreds of dollars per month; or your $10K, $20K $30K balloon payment comes due, then there's a problem.  Mortgage companies don't bother to offer any parachutes when the papers are signed and they get their money, so the homeowner is usually panicked and disoriented and doesn't seek the proper resolution until it's too late and they have no more money.  THUS, foreclosure.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Added:  You heard this from me first.  NO one gives the GAS-GOUGE of the last 2 years much thought these days, but when you factor in the above ARM rate increases plus the $4 per gallon gas, it's a killer.

Pjm9pg7iaa	It would be possible but highly unusual for an existing mortgage to be "redrawn" to a lower payment by paying points. The lenders only offer that on brand new mortgages. <br>  If you were to send in a big check to the mortgage company today, it would not lower the payments, only shorten the loan.

dgsFDJdMaa	No, the FDIC only insures banks.  The NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) is a similar agency and insures only credit unions.  Your funds are most likely insured by the NCUA.  The same level of protection ($250,000) applies to credit union accounts.  Check with your credit union to see if the insurance coverage is $250,000 per person on this type of account, in which case your entire $500,000 would be covered, or $250,000 per account.<br>  <br>  When the increased insurance amount ends on Dec. 31, the coverage levels are supposed to revert back to $100,000 unless legislators extend the coverage for a longer period of time or make it permanent.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Go to www.ncua.gov for more information about the NCUA insurance coverage.|`|aqsUYT9naa	Potentially it is now and will be after December 31.  There are attempts to make the $250,000 permanent.  Trusts are complicated and all of the details need to be considered in order to arrive at the correct answer -- revocable and irrevocable trusts are different.  Generally, each grantor is insured for each beneficiary up to the limit.  You can calculate the coverage yourself using the EDIE Calculator on the FDIC website.  Also, the FDIC website provides detailed information on each ownership type.  While bank officers are not allowed to give legal advice, they should be able to help you work through the scenario.
AA11877260	I have done it three ways:<br>  <br>  1. Visiting the area first and finding a place in advance.<br>  2. Just moving to the area, getting a hotel and finding a place while staying in a hotel.<br>  3. Renting something site unseen and then moving.<br>  <br>  I strongly encourage you to try the first option. If you rent a place without seeing it there can be things wrong with it that you can tell from pictures or word of mouth-- like maybe it smells bad or is in a neighborhood that sucks. It can be really stressful trying to find a place when you are staying in a hotel (or with friends) when you don't have much time to decide you can end up settling for something you don't like. When you go and visit and check out areas ahead of time you'll feel better about it when you get there-- you won't be (hopefully) living someplace miserable and you won't be second guessing your choices.<br>  <br>  As for how it turned out for me, 2 times not so good 3rd time was better. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a1pmr73vaa	Born in USA<br>  Live in Mexico<br>  <br>  saved from my jobs in USA to make my hacienda business in mexico.I have family in mexico so it was very helpful and now I live anr run my business in renting my hacienda and selling cows and sheeps and chicken is all year round business.|`|SJkPy5Yhaa	Honestly it will be impossible to know everything before you go, but on my last relocate I found the police department very helpful about where I wanted to live and how to stay safe in a new place.

However, at a convenience store near my home, I cannot pay for a purchase that is three dollars with my debit card. I've heard that if you want to purchase something that is under one dollar on your debit card, you have to pay an extra fee for paying with a card, and not in bills. Don't hold me on that, because it's what my father told me. Anyway, it depends on what store you're purchasing from.

d2d6d1d2d206350f4858f15ffbfaafa3aa	Forced retirement at any age is age discrimination.     On the other hand, I do understand that it avoids the difficulties of how to handle the occasional employee who starts to have age related dementia.   Forced retirement at a particular age would lend a certain dignity to such folks.<br>  <br>  However, I believe forced retirement is wrong.  I live in Michigan, and Michigan State University used to have a forced retirement at age 70.  A professor fought this policy in the 1960's and refused to retire.  He won on grounds of age discrimination when he took it to court  (his name was 'Lash' Larue).    After having made his point and successfully continued employment there after age 70, he then retired shortly thereafter.<br>  <br>  I believe it is now illegal to require retirement base on age anywhere in Michigan.   <br>  <br>  As far as the difficulties management has to deal with when employees start to become ineffective due to age-related disabilities, I think that this is the sort of thing for which they make the 'big bucks.'  So why should we have a discriminatory policy to take them off the hook and make their job easier?<br>  <br>  Now, on another train of thought, why age 70, or in your case, 68?  If they want to make room for the next generation why not 50 or 45?   Those ages are just as arbitrary.     In my mind, the real answer is that the older seasoned workers are more highly paid and set in their ways and the younger folks are motivated and hungry and MUCH cheaper to employ.   So.... someone somewhere has calculated the age at which the forced retirement age makes the most economic sense to them.  I do NOT believe the retarded claim that they are taking a high-minded social responsibility effort like 'making room for the next generation.'|`|zt3xu4a8aa	I think their policy is definitely going to have to change. Future trends for workers show there are going to be a lot of worker shortages as the Baby Boom generation retires, especially in the information systems and healthcare industries. Add to that the shrinking ratio of working taxpayers to retirees. Right now the ratio is about five workers to one retiree. Within 20 years it will be reduced to 2:1. <br>  <br>  I think the idea of forced retirement is stupid. People who stay active later in life are healthier and more independent than those who aren't. I think our government definitely needs to rethink its policies on Social Security as well. Why penalize someone for working? We paid into the system and we have a right to receive Social Security benefits. Wouldn't it make sense to at least let seniors work part-time without reducing their monthly Social Security check? If they were paying taxes on their work checks, they would actually still be paying into the system instead of just drawing from it. When Social Security was first instituted, the average life span in the United States was 65 years. The age at which Baby Boomers will be able to retire with full Social Security benefits is increasing, but not as much as our average life span. Somehow we are going to have to make the system solvent or face drastic cuts. In my opinion, businesses have a huge untapped resource in seniors. Instead of forcing retirement, they should be coming up with strategies to attract and retain this age group!|`|iBVEbLI3aa	You might want to check that out.  I believe it could very well be called<br>  "Age Discrimination".  As long as you can do your job, have a good attendance record and no other reason why an employer could want to get rid of you, I don't see how they can legally "force" you out.  Times have changed and they can't discriminate any more.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	68 is pretty generous, there are a lot of places that are very discriminatory, its like 45-50 and you're out...no I don't think forced retirement at any age is proper especially if the person loves their job or wants to keep working for financial reasons, or both.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	They CAN'T force you to retire.

NwkZ5OmCaa	One aspect that gets jumbled over time--exactly what the timeline was.<br>  <br>  The IRS gets all copies of W-2s/1099s sometime in June, long after most people have filed.  <br>  <br>  Let's say the original tax bill was correct, but a typo got into the return and caused the IRS computer to refund $2000 based on the error.  Without the W-2, the computer used the typo.<br>  <br>  18 months later, the IRS runs a matching program with the actual W-2s, etc and finds the typo.  It fixes the mistake and sends her a letter (which if she moved doesn't get to her).  With no response, the IRS updates the return/tax bill and leaves the time bomb waiting for the next time she files.<br>  <br>  The IRS can't waive the fix since she isn't entitled to the money.

I think there is more to the story than what you have described and if the IRS made an error they would probably waive some interest and probably not assess penalties.  It would be a good idea to have a tax professional look over the return in question just to make sure every thing is now correct. If in fact your friend owes the money, there is nothing you can do. Your friend can ask for an installment agreement to spread the payments out to make it easier for her to pay. I would ask that the installment agreement be put in place without the normal fee as the IRS caused this hardship.<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

I have not worn out a husky tool to know this, but I have broken a socket, and they did honor the warranty.|`|Un3YxFvRaa	yep... and guaranteed.... which is a win/win|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes, they are good tools. They used to be popular 30 years ago but faded. To protect ourselves as consumers of Husky tools, we need to be sure that a different company didn't  just buy the name. I could not find an answer to that online. Akai was one of the premier names in electronics 40 years ago. A Chinese company bought the name 9 years ago and produces Akai products which are not "premier"..

You would attach a statement to the return saying that your husband is in the military and currently stationed in a combat zone and that you are signing for him.<br>  <br>  If he is not serving in a combat zone then you will need a power of attorney (form 2848) in order to sign the return and you will attach the power of attorney form to your tax return.<br>  <br>  Richard K<br>  <br>  This advice is based upon my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time is was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.

No CC company's will not negotiate down the amount you owe get them below 30% of face value, and pay your bills on time your score will be up within a year. Do realize that you cannot get 100% financing anymore much less additional funds for closing, appraisal, inspection down payment etc. FHA only requires 3.5% down which seems to be about the cheapest unless you are eligible for VA financing. Income or two incomes are only important for your credit to debt ratio. Banks look at numbers only and have specific standards for lending. Think FHA will look at those with at least a 620 so if you are there or above, have the money you will need I would say apply what do you have to lose - except a few more points on your credit rating for having it checked|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	You're not going to like hearing this, but if you have bad credit, you don't deserve to buy a house. That's what got us into this economic mess to begin with. Pay off your debt and improve your credit. Then buy a home. Why does everyone think it's their God-given right to own a home? Rent a place until you are a lower risk for creditors.|`|Jzb55jZhaa	You are on the right track taking steps to improve your credit.  Negotiating the debt yourself is not the way to go. You are correct in your belief that it would take a lot of time and be an overall difficult process.  You could use simple credit repair to improve your score and qualify.  I would check on a professional debt arbitrator to advise you as to whether or not to payoff the debts you mentioned.  You dont need to pay medical to get an FHA home loan and those medical debts usually dont settle anyhow.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	I would pay off all outstanding debts first to help raise your credit score and fix your credit record.

Xp5lgKWOaa	There certainly is something to be said about enjoying what you do when it comes to working at home and making money. Because there are so many different ways to do this we thought we would look at 7 ways to work at home and make money and let you choose one from here.<br>  <br>  1. Start a home business in the home business niche. Recruiting people into a business opportunity is certainly one way to make money and work at home. This is appealing to people who enjoy working with people and who want to build an Internet business around the work at home niche.<br>  <br>  2. Start a network marketing business and build a downline of distributors. This can provide a residual income that allows you to walk away if your business reaches a certain point. People who do well in this type of business model enjoyed building a large network of distributors.<br>  <br>  3. Become an affiliate marketer and get paid to sell other people's products. This is a very easy way to get started because virtually everything you need to succeed is provided for you. You will need to learn how to do affiliate marketing the right way.<br>  <br>  4. Build an email marketing list of names and email addresses to sell to. An opt in list can be worth thousands of dollars to you every month for years to come. One way to quickly build your list is to purchase co-registration leads and build relationships with your subscribers.<br>  <br>  5. Sell products with resell rights. In many instances you can even keep 100% of the profits and earn instant commissions with this type of product. The nice thing is these are usually of the highest quality and the product is already created for you to market.<br>  <br>  6. Sell products with private label rights to them. The difference here is you can make changes to these products if you choose to.<br>  <br>  With resell rights you sell them exactly as it is. Many people like selling PLR products because much of the initial product creation is already in place for them.<br>  <br>  7. Sell a product or service if you have a talent. The Internet has created demand for web designers, blog writers, article marketers, software creators, graphic designers, and much more. You can get paid doing work for other people and do it from the comfort of your own home.<br>  <br>  This is seven ways to work at home and make money. We can come up with a much longer list if we had time, but this should help give you some direction in choosing a way that will work for you.<br>  <br>  The one thing I will tell you is that what ever way you decide to work from home You need to get involved with someone who will train you the proper way to do online marketing. If you do it wrong it will only cost you a lot of money and time and then you will have to start over and will still have to find someone to teach you. If you do it smart you will make a killing.<br>  <br>  I found a good mentor, he has many step-by-step video tutorials and it is a great way to start.<br>  You can look for yourself, check my source.

KWp6QuQWaa	I believe that its a great time to invest in real estate.  Properties are very inexpensive and the mortgage rates are low.  If the rent that you collect covers the mortgage payment, why not?  You can probably even collect a little profit on the rent, due to the low prices.  I would look into 3-4 units or a single family residence with a lot size that has building potential in the future.  Good luck.|`|AA10556595	I am working with this company called We Buy Houses HomeServices LLC.<br>  <br>  They offer a 6% RETURN on your money.

HAPPY INFORMED INVESTING!!!|`|O8qdCBzLaa	I bought a rental condo that was a short sale for $200K. I put down 25% (minimum required for a non-owner-occupied property) and financed the rest at 6.5%. After mortgage payments, property taxes, and HOA dues are paid, I have about a $200 a month positive cash flow. <br>  <br>  The property was worth a peak of $385K in 2007 (when the seller refinanced it). And, property values are supposed to return to those peak values and higher within 10 to 15 years. So, even if I sell at $350K in 10 years, I will have invested $50K cash and gotten back $200K ($50K down payment plus the $150K profit on the sale). So, that's a 400% return on investment or a 40% average annual increase. Not to mention what I'm making on the rent. And, no other investment will give you that kind of return with such little risk.<br>  <br>  One thing you should watch out for with foreclosures: the banks don't have to submit a transfer disclosure statement (TDS) that is required for any other type of real estate transaction. The TDS is an affidavit that a seller fills out describing the condition of the property and any issues they may be aware of that would affect the value of the property. This could be structural problems, code violations known to the city, or even imminent domain issues (like the state is going to put a freeway through your front yard next year).<br>  <br>  It is then incumbent upon the buyer to do inspections and research the property to find out what issues exist before purchasing the property. And, if any issues do exist, it's the buyer's responsibility to deal with them at his expense with no recourse. It may then become a money pit to make it habitable or to even resell it later. So, just be careful and remember the golden rule: If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.|`|l9a8sFT7aa	I think it is a great idea for the buyer, just take a good look a the property first, so many are being stripped, even wiring being taken out.

Yes you can rent them in a week or two, but to tenants I wouldn't recommend.  If you can afford to sit on an empty house for two+ months without any income, then yes it is a very good time to buy a rental property.<br>  <br>  Also, lenders are requiring 30% down on non-owner occupied investment properties.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	If you think "long term", then the next few years might in fact have some nice opportunities.<br>  <br>  BUT...you will not make a killing "flipping" the properties. <br>  Some real estate experts are saying that it might be 2012 before the market is stable again.

In most interviews, the prospective employer will ask you why you left each position you list on your resume. You should always prepare your answers for every question that a prospective employer may ask - this situation is no different. So, when asked why you left this particular job, have an truthful yet positive answer prepared. The key words here are truthful & positive. You can spin the situation into a positive one even though it sounds like the situation was a nightmare. If you give your prospective employer the impression that you are a positive, flexible hardworker then if he/she calls for a reference he/she will have YOUR impression of the way things went FIRST. If your ex employer says crappy negative things about you, don't worry about it. The new employer will probably congratulate you for sticking it out for 4 years in such a crappy environment and give you a shot.

People pay student loans with cash, not credit, so it is money that could be injected into the stream of commerce without increasing consumer debt.

Z1qoQjsZaa	With the labor that we have in place, you are going to have a tough time finding work at 14. The best advice I can give you is either lawn mowing, babysitting, or odd jobs for people.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The last time the economy was like this was in 1982.

BoAEgaAGaa	The only way to dispute is for you to file a paper return to claim the child.  You can attach a copy of the decree with the return, there is a possibility this could speed up the process.  After a few months the IRS will either accept your return, or send you both letters to prove you have the right to claim the child.  Then you would send again the copy of the decree.  <br>  <br>  We see this happen way too often and filing is the only way to get the IRS involved to issue the correct refunds.  <br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|AA12071655	The decree DOES matter.

RZzMse3Haa	Yes you are paying 1st and last months rent upfront. There should not be any further charges for 1st months rent.  You should also expect a security deposit equal to 1 month rent.<br>  <br>  This is all standard.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	You have to pay 2 months rent plus a deposit before you can move in.<br>  <br>  This payment covers rent for the first month you are there. One month's worth of rent is prepaid so that your last month's rent is already covered, and there is a deposit that will be refunded to you after you move out and leave the apartment clean and undamaged. <br>  <br>  The reason for prepaying your last month's rent is to protect landlords against people who refuse to pay because they are moving out anyway. If landlords didn't collect this in advance, there would be a few dishonest people who would refuse to pay their last month's rent, move out. The landlord would be forced to choose between taking the loss or going through the hassle of trying to track the person down and file a lawsuit. <br>  <br>  It has been my experience that if you have good credit some landlords will let you break up your last months rent into extra payments over the first few months. For example, at one apartment I paid 1/3 extra for each of the first 3 months.|`|5xxZyyoMaa	your paying your first and last's month's rent as a security deposit ontop of your rent for the apartment.<br>  <br>  lets say you pay $200 a month (just for ease of math)<br>  <br>  thats a $400 security deposit & $200 rent<br>  $600 for your first month<br>  <br>  This is how most landlords do it.

It would be best to head off problems now. If the 2K is the entire debt levi, then there is no reason to have a hold on your account.  You check with the bank - do not take your husband word for it (this would be the same person who didn't pay his debts years ago). Then start making calls and writing letters to all those that you owe payment too.  Make arraignments to catch up ASAP.  If your bank really does put a hold on the account then do not deposit the next check, but get cashiers checks to pay your bills.  Do not ignore your creditors - it will only come back to haunt you years later - so make the first move yourself and ask for their assistance.

The papers could say something like "Here's a hug<br>  I'm sending your way <br>  You're special to me <br>  & I hope you have a great day!" Have these papers ready for people to write the name of the person they'd like to send a "hug" to, what classroom they're in during 3rd period (or decide what time is best to deliver the grams) & then have them write their name also (or it can be anonymous). You can sell them for 25cents each. After you're done selling for the day, tape down a Hershey's Hug to each little paper then go & deliver the candy to the people in their class. You can make lots of profit since you're only spending a few dollars but making lots more.<br>  <br>  Whatever fundraiser you decide, good luck! ;o)|`|GUrBfgQGaa	An auction would be a great idea. You must also think outside the box a bit. When the auction is going on, make sure you keep on handing out salty snacks and sell the drinks at a higher price. Also make sure that the starting bid is only 10-5 dollars lower than what you want to sell it for.

nhFiEQNAaa	Start getting experience. Community theater, videos, etc. Craigslist or local papers publish these.<br>  If you aren't in LA, NY, or SLC, there won't be too much film. I got some work in LA based solely on my headshot- never had an audition. So get with casting agencies- some of them are free, or very reasonable. Some jobs you can get SAG vouchers, or the actors union. Once you get so many, you're a member, then they will help represent you. The best way to land these are fill ins, so when someone can't make a shoot, the agency calls you and you can make it quick on the set.

Chances are, he'll be impressed enough with your efforts to give you a pass? :)  Good luck...|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	No, pledging a Fraternity is not a legally acceptable reason for breaking the lease.|`|AWSmknxLaa	NO  that certainly is not a valid reason

You need to get busted, because honestly, you sound like the type of person who would do something like this again if you think you can get away with it.

The main thing is to make sure that you know how much you are spending now so that you can set a target goal for reducing your spending. For example, if you spend $1000/month on bills right now and you want to reduce it by ten percent then you'll be working to get your spending down to $900/month. Learn to track all expenses to keep yourself within the budget you set.<br>  <br>  Here are some specific ideas for saving a little bit of money each month:<br>  <br>  - Start eating less meat and dairy. Fresh produce is usually the cheapest food (when it's bought in season) so increase your consumption of this food and reduce meat and dairy to save money on groceries.<br>  <br>  - Stop eating out at restaurants. It's almost always cheaper to eat at home. If you do eat out, reduce what you spend by ordering appetizers instead of entrees and skipping expensive drinks.<br>  <br>  - Get rid of some of your monthly memberships. If you pay monthly fees for the gym, DVD subscriptions etc. then see if you can get rid of one or two of those to cut costs.<br>  <br>  - Learn to barter. Figure out what services you can offer to others and then barter for services that you need. For example, if you can babysit for friends then offer to do that in exchange for services you normally pay for such as petsitting, running errands, cleaning the house or servicing the car.<br>  <br>  - Sell an old item every time that you buy a new item. This is a great trick for making sure that you don't waste money. Every time you want something new - furniture, clothes, books - look around the house to see what you can sell that's of equal value. Sell something first and use that money to buy new things.<br>  <br>  - Enjoy free activities. Many people spend way too much on entertainment and going out. Start finding free things to do in your area including picnics, movie nights at home, free days at museums, etc.<br>  <br>  These are just a few tricks for reducing your spending. The main thing is to think about how much you want to save and to get creative with those savings.
oDqdqLyNaa	If it is a true Visa (eg it can be recharged, unlike most gift cards) then it can be used with Paypal.<br>  <br>  And if you say you have seen the paypal charge and have given paypal their little number as they ask,  then after that you should be ok.<br>  <br>  But when you say that you have been  locked you don't specify where from. If it is Paypal or your "gift card" issue.<br>  <br>  I remember reading the contract on my prepaid card and it spelled out that if you don't identify yourself they'll eventually lock the card and it cannot be unlocked.|`|S253XERKaa	the only thing i can think of is it a visa card use it as a credit card in the invoice from ebay  where it said how to pay  it should say paypal or credit do the credit thing it should work since it a visa card hope this work's|`|UJwb4zuraa	u cant put a giftcard onto a paypal account unless you have your credit card there too|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	Try to contact Paypal regarding this matter. At the same time, notify the seller about the issue. They're usually locked forever until you unlocked it.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	Read your contract!<br>  <br>  Your obligations extend to what you agreed to in that contract and nothing more. How were the prorated taxes described? Were they described? If not then you might be liable for an agreed prorata amount on several years of unpaid taxes. If you cannot understand the contract, use an attorney or a conveyancing specialist. It will be money well spent.|`|BGY1TX64aa	Hire a real estate attorney and do it quickly. Spend another $300 and save yourself potentially thousands. Let him look over the paperwork and tell him about the tax issue. If the tax matter is not settled, the property may not convey. That means, you can't own it until the matter is handled. And the seller may not give a crap and so may do nothing. Then where are you?|`|6r0I0v87aa	The title insurance company will protect you. Don't worry about the agent, all contracts have pro-rated insurance unless it's otherwise stated to the contrary. No title insurance company is going to sting you. <br>  <br>  Make sure you get the HUD statement a day before the closing though and check and see if there are some inaccuracies. Just about every HUD has one or 2 errors. <br>  <br>  If you like the deal don't back out. If you approached the agent (duel) and got the price down then don't worry about him. If you paid close to retail and he told you the place was worth millions beware. I have never had a problem with a dual agent. <br>  <br>  I can answer questions like this on my blog at www.i-can-sell-my-house.com/welcome|`|dEFAr123aa	That's definitely a question you should bring up with your closing attorney.

RxeQJcqhaa	You really need to consult an attorney on this one. It sounds like you did the right thing - notifying him, giving over 2 months deposit and the landlord DID rent the property. However, "the right thing" sometimes is not exactly legally correct, and you might end up liable for whatever they are asking if you do not have an attorney for this.  Call legal aid in your county - they will get you set up.  Gather as much info from your rental as possible - the lease, copies of your payment receipts, hopefully you have a copy of whatever notice you served the landlord...Do not ignore the court appearance, either! <br>  <br>  The court can order a judgment against you for the $6K, plus attorney fees and court costs.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	Are you being sued in small claims court or in superior or municipal court?  <br>  <br>  If you are being sued in either Superior or Muni Court you must file a written response within 30 days after service or you will not be able to address and defend yourself in the court and a default judgment will be automatically issued against you.<br>  <br>  Did you personally sign the lease or is it in just your corporation's name?    Does your corporation have any assets?  If you didn't co-sign for your corporation and if your corp. doesn't have any assets you have nothing to lose.  I sure wouldn't go throwing good after bad to protect a valueless corporation.   If your personal guarantee is on the lease I would have a talk with an attorney.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  In most states if you vacate prior to the lease expiration date you can be held liable for rent until the unit is re-rented or your lease expires, whichever occurs first.

y2pErbI2aa	I'm in college right now. Most of my friends who are accounting majors hate it; They think it's super boring and they are only accounting majors because they are good at it, want to make a lot of money, or want to start their own business.<br>  <br>  Also, during tax season, you can work crazy hours. I know right now, 60 hours a week is pretty much the norm. There was a big snowstorm here the other day, and most people took off from work. However, my friend who is an intern at an accounting firm told me that pretty much everyone went into the office that day because they felt they couldn't miss work.<br>  <br>  A good thing about accounting is that it has job security. Companies can never have enough accountants. If you go to a school with even a semi-reputable business school, you're pretty much guaranteed a job out of college, even in today's economy. It's also relatively high-paying, especially coming right out of school<br>  <br>  Forensic accounting, though, is a little more interesting. Basically, you use accounting to figure out if someone is embezzling from their company, cooking their books, etc. However, there are less opportunities for this than for traditional accounting work|`|0vLU2GGGaa	Yes, accounting job can be boring and stressful.  To be a successful accountant you need to be very patient, extremely attention to details, and not afraid of routine.  If you don't like sitting at the desk or anything stressful, it might not be the right field for you.  Not only tax season is stressful, depends on what type of accountant you are, but mostly you have a few time in a month that get you extremely busy, like month end, or pay period.|`|3fbd317d2be0562823806adcc0ba0873aa	I have a friend who is a Finance and Accounting major, and he will be graduating in May.  He hates the accounting aspect of his degree, but then again, that's him.  Remember, you need to do what you think is fun.  Before going for a major or a job for the matter, don't forget to think of this:<br>  <br>  Would I wake up wanting to go to work?<br>  <br>  Do you like being organized?  You said you liked the structure and straightforwardness.  Personally, I graduated with a degree in Marketing and didn't like accounting.  I took the classes though, and you'd be surprised that there are "philosophies" to accounting.  It's not strictly about math, in fact, the most math you would need is what you've learned in elementary school.<br>  <br>  Learning accounting is like learning another language.  It is full of totally new concepts.  Why is something debited from one accout, when it is credited to another?  When is it best to use to LiFo or FiFo method?<br>  <br>  I would suggest talking to someone you know who is an accountant, or if you don't know any, find one and tell them you are interested in becoming an accoutant, and would like to interview them to see if it is the right career choice for you.  You may just be killing two birds with one stone!  By talking to them and showing interest in the profession, you might also be networking.  If you are professional, and personable, that person might even want to remember you when you graduate, and who knows, they might be in the position to offer you a job when you graduate (or at least know if anyone else is looking for an accounting professional).<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful!<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions about looking for a job, or other questions about career choices, check out my daily blog "The Job Hunt Blog" at www.jobpit.blogspot.com.|`|8XT17ra1aa	I work at H & R block.

N7G26k4Iaa	Well, when someone fills in a W-4, they are certifying that they are truly exempt from paying taxes whereas they are not.  And you know it since they do not claim exempt on their regular earnings.  So yes, there is a problem in doing this.  Also, they are setting themselves up for a penalty from the IRS for not paying their taxes in a timely manner.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	No, you do an  "irregular payment" withholding which does NOT use the W-4 and it's a flat 25% for federal.<br>  <br>  NONE of your employees can legally file "exempt" for even one pay period.

Some state and municipal governments also impose income taxes. <br>  The first Federal income tax was imposed (under Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution) during the Civil War, then again in the 1890s, and again after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913. <br>  Current income taxes are imposed under these constitutional provisions and various sections of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including 26 U.S.C. § 1 (imposing income tax on the taxable income of individuals, estates and trusts) and 26 U.S.C. § 11 (imposing income tax on the taxable income of corporations).|`|zuGKIWfNaa	The U.S. Code *is* the law.<br>  <br>  Anyone who says it's not is misinformed.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Yes it clearly states "income".<br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing that makes people wonder is the actuall definition of INCOME, which in reality means, Gains or profits from business or investments... So, by law as stated in the constitution, One should not pay taxes on WAGES. If this was widely accepted, C Corporations would have to be abolished or prevent the Shareholders to take wages. Or like the S Corps, just pass everything through the Shareholders, and have them pay a tax on that, without allowing Shareholders to take a wage.<br>  <br>  <br>  But to answer your Question, YES one must pay taxes on INCOME.|`|HJT3KIPOaa	Whoever told you income taxes were not "direct or indirect" was wrong. Every tax that Congress passes is direct, indirect, or bits of both, although for income taxes the distinction is irrelevant. Congress can tax anything except state exports. It could tax the hairs on your head if it saw fit.|`|AA11284831	Of course there is!  There's NO way that the government could collect it without law to back up the collection efforts.<br>  <br>  The law is called Title 26 of the US Code.

Have a nice day.|`|vEj71xuIaa	I think the more interesting answer is: what if that were the case? What would happen if people didn't have to pay taxes, and if the IRS lost every case where it tried to make them do so?<br>  <br>  The first result is that Congress would immediately fix the law so that it said what they meant it to. Unfortunately, if you're going to win an argument about whether or not we should pay taxes, it shouldn't rest on saying that Congress should be bound by their bad grammar.

I "exaggerated" a little on my resume and got a job as a Paralegal. I had no clue what I was doing and managed to pick up very quickly and master the job. As far as requirements, I didnt have any experience in the area, as far as litigation and actual paralegal work. I had legal secretarial experience but as far as the complexity of paralegal work, I wouldnt have landed the job if I hadn't exaggerated. If you are smart and pick things up quicky dont worry about experience and requirements. Ive been working here over ayear now and making nice money.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	You can have a balance in your paypal account by having other people pay YOU through paypal.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a bank account, or a credit card to attach to your paypal account, maybe you have a friend who has a paypal account?  In which case, you could ask them if they would transfer the amount you need to your account, then you pay them the cash.<br>  <br>  Never trust a stranger with this sort of thing.  Unless you're willing to risk losing your money.
5BTKscZraa	Option #1 is not going to happen...when a credit card is charged-off as bad debt, it stays for 7 years on your credit report....even if it's paid in full.  A debt collector will tell you anything to get their hands in your wallet to extract the max. amount of money.<br>  <br>  When a credit card is charged-off, the damage to your credit is already done and there is no undoing it by paying it back in full after the charge-off has occurred. If you're going to pay off old-charged-off debt anyway, then you might as well negotiate the lowest, rock bottom settlement you can possibly get, being that the negative charge-off notation is going to stay for 7 years on your credit report, regardless of whether the charge-off is paid or unpaid. ...Offer 25%. Mail them a vaguely worded statement like:<br>  <br>  I am willing to settle this matter for 25% of the original amount. This is in no way an admission of this debt, but rather an attempt to settle this matter. Your firm must send me a written agreement on your company's letterhead that you will accept this amount as "payment in full" and that is issue will be settled. Upon receipt of this agreement, I will mail you a money order for this amount.<br>  =========================<br>  Tips for Dealing with Debt Collectors<br>  ================================<br>  *  Get all terms of any settlement deal you reach with debt collectors IN WRITING BEFORE you give them your money. This letter should state the settlement amount and that the account will be settled/paid in full upon receipt of this amount from you. Keep the letter in a safe place. Never accept  settlement deals over the phone that are not backed up in written terms.   If you don’t, the debt collectors will deny that any settlement was ever made once they get your “settlement” money and will come back demanding more money from you...or they will resell your account to another collection agency months/years later that will start the collection process all over again and you’ll have no proof that the account was paid in full.    <br>  *  NEVER, EVER give out your checking account/bank routing numbers to debt collectors for making electronic debit payments. This is like giving the keys to your front door to a burglar. <br>  * Debt collectors love to create a false sense of urgency...If they’ve waited months/years for your payment, they can wait one or two weeks for any payment or settlement agreement from you. Any “deadline” like 5PM to get any payment to them is bogus. <br>  *  Debt collectors will often pretend to be (or represent) attorneys when this is not the case. This is a violation of federal law. To confirm if this is a “real” legal threat, ask for their attorney’s full name and license number in the state bar association. Call your state bar association to confirm this info.  If they refuse to give this info to you, then the legal threat is probably a bluff. <br>  *  Debt collectors have NO power whatsoever to have you arrested/sent to jail for not paying them. <br>  *  By themselves, debt collectors have absolutely NO legal power over you., they cannot garnish your wages or freeze checking accounts...only a court can authorize this and they’d have to go through the court system to do this.<br>  * Settled/forgiven debt is treated like earned income by the IRS....You’ll have to add the forgiven debt to your income on next year’s income taxes and pay whatever additional taxes on that.|`|5f297977fd704bd8099a65707f996f59aa	No matter what you do your credit is already adversely affected in spite of what the collection agent has told you. They lied to you to get a payment. Walmart has already written off your account and sold it to the collection agency for less than you owed on it. They are  in the picture now in name only. That is how collection agents and junk debt buyers make their money. They buy the bad debt for pennies on the dollar and try to collect the full amount from the debtors.<br>  You don't need to give the collection agent an anwer tonight. Collection agents use debtor guilt for not being able to pay debts against them to try and wangle any money they can out of them. You need to realize that even though you legitimately owe the money you have certain rights too. <br>  If you insist on making some sort of settlement with them then follow the advice given earlier by CatDad and insist on a written settlement agreement from them. When you receive this, and only then, should you give them any money.<br>  No matter what you do, pay or not, this will be a derogatory item on your credit report.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	just so you know, no matter which choice you choose the item will apear on your credit report. It will show as paid in full or settled and it will always be on your credit report! Your credit is already screwed up and will take a while to get it back to a good score again. So do whatever is best for you!|`|3QzJjdlNaa	Well you don't have the money. So I guess that's what you have to tell them. I have No money. Do what you got to do. I hope that you are in your early 20's so that your credit dose not effect you but it's not that bad only 7 years. As long as you pay your student loans back in full you should be ok. Just don't get behind with Goverment loan they never go away. Learn from your mistake don't live on credit you live and learn. Just this is a hard way of learning. Don't worry what done is done. After seven years they can't get you for the money but if you have it at some point pay it. It looks better for future credit. Good Luck|`|r1X42OWqaa	First, you don't need to give them an answer tonight.  Its a big decision for you and you need to take your time making it.  Tell them you need two days to decide.  Decisions made under extreme pressure are rarely the correct ones.  If they become abusive report them to the Federal Trade Commission or the Attorney General in your state.  Tell them if they abuse you, you will file for bankruptcy and they won't get a dime from you.<br>  <br>  Second, if you select option 1 make sure you get it in writing at the time you give them any money.  Otherwise you will pay the extra money to get clean credit and they will ruin it on you anyway because they lie like hell.<br>  <br>  Third, if you give them all your money will you still have enough money for school?  If no, remember that school should be your first priority. <br>  <br>  Fourth, if you offer Walmart a reasonable payment plan they will accept it because then they get to charge you interest.  The reason the collection agency wants a lump sum right away instead of you making monthly payments is because they make their money on a percentage of what you pay, so they want alot paid right way.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|x8IDwJYjaa	You  would probably be better off calling legal aid and getting advice before doing anything at all. I have a friend that is going through a similar situation and that is what she is doing.  They really can't do anything if you are not paying anything but send threatening letters which is mostly scare tactics.  But really consider calling legal aid before sending any kind of money.
AA11616170	It is greed.  I think it blinkers people  -  they can't see that milking the system is depriving everyone.

lM4xtXwAaa	There are different ways to accomplish this. First thing for anyone to realize is that the small business is charged a fee for transactions on the consumers credit card, anywhere between 1.5% to 4% depending on the credit card company. It is legal to charge a processing charge for credit cards by the small business. One way could be to post a sign that says that all credit card charges will incur an extra 2% credit card processing charge, or you can post a sign that no credit cards are accepted for any transactions under a certain amount of the sale, i.e. purchases under $5. This allows you to cover the charge within your profit margin on the product. The last way is to raise the GP% (gross profit) on all of your products 2%.|`|bd5igvDTaa	Well I think it is legal because you're suppose to tell the customer about the charge before you do the transaction. I've been to smaller businesses that do charge a small fee.

It will be percieved as a perk then instead of as a penalty.|`|KzmrWzOJaa	That is stupid. It doesnt sound leagl to me.

Hx88UGlpaa	What the bankruptcy trustee is looking for is a reason as to WHY you didn't pay. If you had loss of income, a decrease in your income, which you told them, they will reveiw that...What he wanted to know was, in the last 6 months, seeing that is the income they look at, if your income decreased, then this is why you are filing. You should be fine, call your attorney and ask them, this is what you pay them for. They can tell you more than we can, but.....if your income decreased in the last 6 months, you should be fine. You will know in approx 6 months when/if you receive discharge paperwork from the courts, but in the meantime, ask your attorney, if they were there with you, they should have answered this question right then and there.

XzLUA7ataa	Just to go to college, you'll probably need two years of math at the high school level.  I remember feeling exactly the same way.There was definite math anxiety for me.  You can probably work your way through it, especially if you ask for some private tutoring from someone with a caring and patient attitude.  To become a psychologist, you'll need a Master's Degree (that's two year's additional college after the first four years for your Bachelor's Degree).  You'll need to study Statistics, which only sounds terrible, it really isn't..  Somehow, by the grace of God, and with a wonderful professor, I passed it with an A.<br>     Imagine that!

That happens very infrequently and only to people who have made themselves extra deserving of harsh treatment.

This will keep your deductible interest separate from mortgage or persoanl interest and ease the preparation of your tax return.<br>  <br>  Either way, the interest would be reported on Schedule C, Interest expense.

2UvVIRjNaa	Since you mentioned you would like to attend graduate school to obtain your Master's degree, you may want to reconsider taking the time to earn an accounting certificate that is likely the equivalent of an Associates Degree. Depending what you want to do in an accounting capacity, career opportunities and earning potential may be limited with an accounting certificate even though you’ll have your graduate degree.<br>  <br>  In order to sit for the CPA most states require 150 college hours. You already have an undergraduate degree so the remaining hours (36 or so?) could be spent in graduate school taking accounting. The caveat is that it may be very difficult depending how much formal instruction you have had in accounting.<br>  <br>  If you have an idea where you want to attend grad school than make an appointment with an advisor and have the person outline the degree program and edit your transcripts. You may discover it is possible to attain the hours you need there. Acceptance and entrance in to a grad school of business is usually contingent on your undergraduate performance and your GMAT – Graduate Management Admission Test.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the advisor may indicate that you would benefit from taking a few prep/intro classes at the community college before you transfer. The few courses you take will help build your foundation, be less expensive and prepare you for advanced courses. Further, the hours may apply to the 150-hour requirement.<br>  <br>  I am not suggesting you ought to be a CPA or take the exam but since you are interested in an accounting certificate *and* would like to go to grad school, this may be a wiser way to spend your time and resources - and advance you a little further. Based on what you've said, I truly don't think an accounting certificate will be necessary or even an advantage.  Either way, be sure to consult with a graduate advisor. Good luck.|`|XzLUA7ataa	My expectation would be that the certificate should suffice.

I thought that they had lost a really big lawsuit recently.  Because they didn't really negotiate much of a settlement with the creditors, in fact, most creditors, when hearing that someone was going through CCCS or someone like them, they considered it just like you were about ready to file bankruptcy anyway.  The credit card companies would use CCCS to squeeze about six months worth of payments out of people before they inevitably file for bankruptcy, because their credit is fried anyway and they couldn't sustain the payment schedule.|`|HXpZmGwaaa	I don't know how far in debt you are, but I would suggest you talk to an attorney about bankruptcy, as the above guy stated.  We are filing Chapter 7 because of the economy, we had to close our business and unable to find other jobs.  We really do not want to do this, but at this time we have no other choice.  You fall behind on payments then the calls start and they never end.  This can be very stressful. If you file bankruptcy you will be required to go through credit counseling before you file.  If you don't have a job, may I suggest you start looking for one.  I know with the economy it is tough to find work.  Also, look around your house to see if there is anything you don't need and try to sell it.  I have done this.  We are now sleeping on a mattress on the floor, it could be worse.  Good luck.

Contact the ACAS helpline - they are very helpful.<br>  You only  get a P60 after the end of the tax year.<br>  Your employer cannot just say you are self employed - this is a classic way of him avoiding his repsonsibilities and you would have no employment rights.

3CoHM0NJaa	You can discuss your situation with a Small Business Development Center or Score representative but let me tell you a cold hard fact.  <br>  <br>  Not every business is going to survive these hard economic times. Restaurants, a tough business even in the best of times, are going to be very hard hit, especially a relatively new restaurant which hasn't established a long time clientele.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes business owners need to hear the darkest truth, that it is time to cut your loses and close the doors.|`|j7BRT7F8aa	In truth, it sounds as though the business would be struggling even if the rent was more reasonable.  It will likely be some time (late '09/early '10) before you can reasonably expect business to pick-up.  So, you need to assess whether a lowered rent will even benefit your small restaurant enough to survive until the economy turns around.  If the answer is no, then why delay the inevitable?  As one commenter stated, you should cut your losses, recover whatever tangible assets you can and stash some cash (friends/family).  Declare bankruptcy and it will be on your record for (I believe) 10 years.  Of course, you can get further into debt and delay the process if it suits you.  Good luck!|`|0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	Things really depend on the real estate market in your town. Normally I would suggest going to the landlord, telling him your situation and asking to renegotiate the rent: if you declare bankruptcy, he'll never recover the remaining amount of the contract, and in the present market, he's liable to be sitting on an empty restaurant space for quite some time... even in a university town.

It takes some trust, security cameras and flexibility...however in hard times it pays to be creative. <br>  Also before losing everything that you have invested, perhaps get creative and find a partner or do your due diligence to find the issue, look at revamping your menu, run specials, host open mic night since it only seats 54, offer fantastic deals to service organizations to host their meeting at your restaurant. If you are right across the street from a college, pizza  is always a natural choice (it is very cost effective to make) or brand your restaurant as Organic!|`|pviDmnBLaa	as a final resort and no way to get out, then take your valuables, sell some plants and equipments, take the money out of your accounts and keep at safer place at home or locker and file bankruptcy. so go for that before u drain another grand into it, even the landlord can't take any action against u  . but remember u will never be able to do business again, one more if u have more partners let them get out of contract quickly and leave only one who does not wish to do business in future.

dlgxprfPaa	Hi, <br>  My sincere advice would be to get a Pre Paid Legal membership and speak directly to a Real Estate Attorney. I just got one last month and let me tell you the membership has saved me hundreds of dollars in legal services.

Pre-Paid Legal has an expert in every area of law to give you the answers you need, to be certain that your decisions are in your best interest.<br>  <br>  This is the best bang for your buck in my opinion. Don't waste your money talking to an attorney where they are going to charge you $200/hour. The membership is just $27/ month and I just pay month to month. Just my 2 cents. Good Luck to you.

Based on The Pareto principle (also known as the 80-20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.This is the famous Pareto principle, named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of the land in Italy at the turn of the 19th Century was owned by 20% of the population.Pareto was a heavy influence on  the Fascist dictator Mussolini, although the 80/20 rule never entered into the equation.<br>   It is a common rule of thumb in business; e.g., "80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients."<br>  Take it with a grain of salt.

If your employer is incorporated in most jurisdictions it must retain a lawyer to represent it in court and unless your 2 weeks pay is a large amount, if your employer is practical it will simply cave in and pay you your severance pay because the costs of defending any legal action will far exceed any money it saves.  Hopefully your severance pay is small enough to file in small claims court in which case your cost in court fees will be fairly minimal.|`|3fbd317d2be0562823806adcc0ba0873aa	You may be in a sticky situation.  For one thing, it really depends on how everything was worded.  Then may have taken you saying "I'd rather be laid off" as meaning that "I quit".  In that case, they have no legal obligation to pay you the two weeks of severance.  What you should have done was said "I do not accept being moved from full to part time", because legally when they tell you that you are being moved from Full to Part time, you are basically given the option, even though they may make it seem like you have no choice.<br>  <br>  Again, it's all about "coulda, woulda, shoulda".<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions about searching for jobs, check out my daily blog "The Job Hunt Blog" at www.jobpit.blogspot.com.

If the other people are also on the lease, you might be able to go to the landlord and tell him that you want to be taken off the lease because you're moving.  If it's only you, that might be a problem.  If you just move and they stop paying the rent, it will damage your credit.  Clearly you need to stop giving money to them expecting them to be mature and responsible.  When the electric bill comes, send your share directly to them.  If the remainder doesn't get paid it's pretty clear who's at fault.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  Your chances are fairly good you can be removed if one of theirs is still on it and both they and the landlord agree.  I don't know if you have a nice landlord or not, but sometimes even though it's likely going to be a headache for them down the road, they are willing to let you out if you explain the situation.|`|U3jZFawtaa	I assume the lease has your names on it. If so then its up to the landlord and experienced landlords have dealt with this before. Talk to them to see if you advertise to get a replacement that they can take you off the lease and put the newbies on. Make sure its a clean break not you as a back up. Old lease voided and new lease not with your names on it. Spend a little time and money that way and you might save yourself the headaches. Till then write payments out to utilities directly with respective account numbers on it. If the landlord is in the stone ages or inexperienced or sees them like you do and doesnt want the more responsible side off the hook then yes you have to pay till the end of the contract. Good Luck
dRezbY31aa	The subsidy went into effect March 1. You have 60 days from February 17 to sign up for COBRA and you need to contact the COBRA administrator for assistance. You do not have to pay for January or February. Even if you did have insurance during that time the subsidy doesn't count then so you'd pay 100%. <br>  <br>  Here is a website for info: <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/COBRA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/COBRA.html</a>|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Normally you get 30 days before paying COBRA. What should have occurred is that your employer should have provided a package explaining COBRA and its costs. You elect to take COBRA and pay in advance. If you did not pay in advance, the coverage should not have continued. Insurance is prepaid. She had a leagal obligation to provide the COBRA information within a specific period of time. You had 60 days to elect continued coverage. You need to determine if they followed the guidelines. This 60 day window is why a lot of employers continue coverage for 30 days after termination. <br>  <br>  Did you elect COBRA coverage?
6fgNHz3haa	Ok, first of all:<br>  "if he is faith full to his agent that 6% doesn't matter to him-another suggestion is to get your own agent"<br>  Really?  $36,000 of his property doesn't matter to him.  I doubt this would be the case even if she was doing a fantastic job.<br>  <br>  "you have nothing to loose- seller pays agents."  Total poppycock!  The buyer pays the agents.  Where does the money for this transaction come from?  100% the buyer.  Just because the cash flows through the seller, doesn't mean the buyer isn't paying for it.  Yes, if a buyer is dumb enough to not care that someone is making $36,000 for several to several hundred hours of minimally expert work, then yes asking price is asking price.  But anyone who appreciates the situation realizes that the buyer is paying for the agents.<br>  <br>  Here's my suggestion:  Agents are ethically required to bring all offers to the buyer.  Make an offer for the place and say the offer is contingent on the real estate agency refunding to you 45%? of the fee and further contingent on me not having an agent.  They won't do it because agents have managed to make that illegal in NY, to protect their ridiculous compensation scheme, but it will let the buyer know... hey, I can renegotiate my fee with this agent to reflect the 3% she didn't expect to get anyway.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	There is almost always a listing agreement between seller and the listing agent.

The only way an item can be removed before the 7 year reporting period is up is if the item is incorrect or inaccurate.

ucYwexwJaa	My understanding is that if you're on unemployment, and take a job, ANY job whether it's full time or temp, will cancel the unemployment checks immediately.  You wouldn't be eligible to reapply for unemployment with that company either, after your temp job ends.  If you find a temp job paying $12/hour I would advise you to stay on unemployment and draw your $10/hour without having to burn the gas, pay for lunches, etc. that's involved in commuting to work. Best of luck to you, I hear it's pretty bad in California these days.
