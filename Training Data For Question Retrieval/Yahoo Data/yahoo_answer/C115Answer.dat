Immigration looks more closely at someone who is going to study Chemistry, Nuclear physics, etc( I am assuming he is going to college not high school here). School transcripts and vaccination records will be a necessity. I would recommend starting the Hep B series as schools are now requiring it here. Usually they recommend a healthy comprehension of the English language, I would say about two years of study, not necessarily fluency.   They will also determine overstay risk, though they aren't too great at this sometimes. They will look into how strong his ties to Mexico are, how likely is it he will want to return home? If they find that he will have very little desire to go back home, and possibly overstay his visa, it will be less likely they will approve his application.|`|AA11730134	If you are white ...you will get it so fast|`|AA10981526	Student needs to provide consulate with SEVIS Form I-20 which is issued by the school. Also, one needs to provide evidence that there are sufficient funds to finance ones education.  F-1 students also have to demonstrate Non-immigrant (Temporary) intent.  Therefore, it is extremely important to document strong ties to one' home country and an intent to return once the degree is completed.    The school determines if the student meets English language standards, not the government.

AA12323676	Without knowing where you are the best that I can tell you is that the length of time required for adverse possession in title varies - it could be as short as a few years or could run for twenty years or more.     Typically public entities must establish a longer period of possession than individuals.     Some states have adopted a rule which requires the adverse possessor to pay taxes each year on the land.     The possession must be open for all to see.     The possession must be exclusive to him or her (e.g., the fence in the above example, a driveway, road, etc.)     The possession must be hostile to the actual owner of the land and the owner must not have done anything to show that he does not approve.|`|4009ce3b2dfbedf024b426210a9f5795aa	in victoria australia, if a person has been in occupation of land for 15 years continuously and the legal owner (which would be the bank) did nothing to claim that land or act in any way to indicate they owned the land then the person in possession can make a claim to be declared the legal owner

It is something like one generation or less for a poor but educated immigrant who speaks English to enter the middle class and start paying for others rather than being paid for.  On the other hand it is more on the nature of two and a half generations before the poor but uneducated and non-English speaking make the middle class.    Right now the debate is length of time people are here, but that is easy to claim with fraudulent documents.  If the country goes through with a partial amnesty it would actually make more sense to do it based on education and who has paid taxes all along.

Our welfare system has many different ethnicity's, some that are truly needed.  Welfare has many system problems but at least the people using it are here legally.  Better to try to change the system problems and give the chance to our own citizens.  iam a nurse and many times have seen illegals with health needs.  Our tax and health cost's soar because of this.  that does not even include education. I have seen hard working legals get turned down for these things.   Maybe we could take care of our own if we did not have this influx of illegals to pay for.

Leider hat Russland immer noch Gro?machtgelüste, statt sich um ihre Bev?lkerung zu kümmern. Wenn das Abwehrschild installiert ist, kann auch Russland Europa nicht mehr bedrohen.|`|Bi3qJOuOaa	Nein. Der NATO-Doppelbeschluss war die Antwort auf eine Aktion, also eine Reaktion. dieser "Raketenabwehrschild" reagiert auf gar nichts, sondern ist von sich aus Aktion, und zwar in Form von dummer Aggression.<br>  <br>  Der NATO-Doppelbeschluss war ein wichtiges Element, das den damaligen Ostblock zwang, mit dem widerlichen Wettrüsten aufzuh?ren.

iBLDy8dmaa	Halloooooo, das ist Afghanistan und nicht Dresden. Und Afghanistan und Deutschland sind überhaupt nicht zu vergleichen. Es wird dort keine Feldschlachten wie im 2.Weltkrieg geben k?nnen. Die Taliban lehnen das ab. Und das ist auch gut so, zumindest für die Taliban. Bereits im 2.Weltkrieg gab es L?nder, die nach diesen Regeln gespielt haben. So hat z.B. die Partisanen-Armee unter Tito in Jugoslawien der deutschen Wehrmacht schwerste Verluste zugefügt. Ohne Feldschlacht!! Und noch weiter zurück, der Feldzug Napoleons gegen Ru?land wurde ein Fiasko für Napoleon, obwohl dieser seinem russischen Gegner weit überlegen war. Der russische Oberbefehlshaber lehnte entscheidende Feldschlachten ab und zog sich immer weiter nach Russland zurück. Das Ende ist bekannt. Napoleon verlor fast seine gesamte Armee. Die Vietnamesen, die letzlich die Amerikaner aus ihrem Land vertrieben, waren Meister im Partisanenkampf. Sie trugen und zerrten ihre Ausrüstung kreuz und quer durch das Land. Dazu waren die Amerikaner überhaupt nicht f?hig. Und nun in neuester Zeit: Der Irakkrieg ist verloren. Und die Welt hat gesehen, da? die gr??te Milit?rmacht der Welt es nicht schafft. Der Afghanistankrieg ebenfalls verloren, weil es auch dort nicht gelang, die Herzen der Menschen zu erobern. Man will dort keine Besatzer, auch dann nicht, wenn sie unter dem Mantel des sozialen Engagements kommen und vorgeben, den Menschen helfen zu wollen. Besatzungstruppen sind Besatzungstruppen.

Ovvio ci sono delinquenti anche tra gli stranieri, sono uomini e donne come tutti, banale. E' triste pensare che qualcuno sia convinto che i probemi si risolvano mandando tutti gli stranieri a "casa loro"........e casa tua qual'è? E casa mia? Chi lo stabilisce? E quelli che lavorano in nero in cantiere, nelle fabbriche, sfruttati da eleganti imprenditori italiani? Quelli che costruiscono le case dove abiteranno probabilemnte i tuoi figli e non i suoi.

c3ac5108a51530e90cfc16193fb1ca44aa	The bill that regards the troop 'surge' that you are referring to is a spending bill which includes funds for conducting the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The surge itself, however, is within presidential discretion much in the same way as the initial invasion was which, arguably, did not require Congressional approval.  The House of Reps passed a funding bill that included a deadline for leaving Iraq.  The Senate is, or soon will be, considering a similiar funding bill.  If, after the two are combined, the dealine remains in the bill which goes to Bush it will definately be vetoed.  Chances are better that the Senate will approve a weaker bill or one without a deadline and when it goes to conference the deadline will be edited out.  It will then go back to each chamber for final approval and pass without the deadline.  Finally, to the question of impeachment, it is not an impeachable offense to ignore Congress.  Only if the law is broken, and badly, is impeachment even a remote option.  Given the atmosphere right now it seems unlikely that Bush will ever be impeached, but if things change (like if proof of deliberate deception in the lead-up to the war is found) then it could happen...but don't hold your breath.|`|qHFh2njEaa	I would say you need to do ALOT of research

GicN1B2raa	I am not sure exactly what you are looking for. I am having a little trouble figuring out what the county wants you to do and the reasons why. However, as far as online statutes, here is a link that may help you find what you are looking for. Hopefully, this will help. If not, maybe try Ohio.gov and lookup the numbers to local government offices that may be able to assist you further or you can contact an attorney for  consultation advising you with this situation.<br>  Here's the link:<br>  <a href="http://onlinedocs.andersonpublishing.com/oh/lpExt.dll?f=templates&fn=main-h.htm&cp=PORC" rel="nofollow">http://onlinedocs.andersonpublishing.com...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Okay, i thought you were looking for laws, not trying to have them enforced. In this situation I would definitly call the state police and file a report with them over the damage this farmer is doing to your property. I would also contact a lawyer to represent you in front of the council and to possibly recover the costs of damages you have or will incur. Unfortunatly, to minimalize damage to your property any further, you may have to go forth with remedying the situation yourself and then sue the responsible party for causing these damages. I am sorry you are going through this and I wish I could be more help.

Il ne faudrait quand même pas oublier que nous sommes en démocratie, sous un principe républicain, que le FN a toujours suivi, quoiqu'en disent les mauvaises langues ou les avis trop prompts. C'est donc un parti aussi républicain que les autres, extrême gauche comprise - puisqu'elle suit également les mêmes règles. <br>  De plus c'est la véritable troisième force politique, puisque l'UDF vient de se tirer dans le pied en se divisant. <br>  Il est un véritable contre-pouvoir qui n'a jamais accepté les copinages ou autres associations politiques afin d'asseoir ces fesses aux manettes. Ce qui lui a valu de n'y être jamais. C'est peut-être une faiblesse mais c'est aussi une preuve de d'intégrité - chose qui fait défaut aux autres politiques classiques.<br>  Le Pen et le Front national - que l'on soit d'accord ou pas avec ses idées - permet d'aborder la politique sous un regard différent, évitant ainsi l'instauration de la pensée unique telle qu'on la constate actuellement.

Like the F/A-18 it will be a multi-mission aircraft that can dogfight, bomb, refuel and do every other job in the fleet.  The problem here is money.  They can do what they did with the F/A-18 and use another service rejected aircraft and develop it - the Hornet has turned out OK from the F-16 program.

d8466323a6d9157fa7ad5f14197407f1aa	No, it doesn't.  It's a common tactic, though, employed by both sides.  It relates to an earlier question you asked about whether or not "But the other guy did it!" is an acceptable excuse for abhorrent behavior on the part of our politicians.<br>  <br>  Basically, the purpose of this tactic is to deflect attention from any wrongdoing by one party by trying to get people to focus on wrongdoing by others.<br>  <br>  In this specific case, it's just stupid because the person wasn't comparing Fred Thompson and Bill Clinton (like they should have, if they were going to employ this inane tactic correctly), but Fred Thompson and HILLARY Clinton, who has not displayed any marital infidelity (except in the fantasies of the extreme right wing neoconservative).<br>  <br>  But I wish people would stop doing that.  Our politicians will never accept personal responsibility as long as their constituents are using lame arguments like that to try to win debates.|`|KHGlehfhaa	In a one-on-one debate, it's a perfectly valid tactic to use in a debate.  Attacking the framework with which one bases criticism of another is both valid and effective.<br>  <br>  It simply comes down to the old saying "It's like the kettle calling the pot black."  Why should you be allowed to criticize Thompson for his divorce when you supported Bill and Hillary through their infidelities?  Why would you cheer for Scooter Libby's conviction when Bill committed the same crime and you wouldn't hear any criticism of him for it?  <br>  <br>  The end result is that using the argument tactic that you despair of works because it destroys the other person's credibility.  Without credibility, you have no merit or standing to make any arguments at all.  That'd be like the pot calling the kettle black.|`|f0d80864599bd5fa0b57c5fa3d65a9e0aa	Goooooooooo Fred!

(less than 2% of illegals actually are employed in the farm sector)    "They do jobs Americans won't do"  (who did these jobs before the influx of illegals?)    "Good family values" (see Kris' answer)    "If you're not a Native American, you're an immigrant" (how far back are we supposed to go?  And where's the distinction between LEGAL and ILLEGAL immigrant?)    Oops ... forgot one old hoary one:      "Illegals DO pay taxes and they get nothing back" (even IF they do pay income tax, which most of them don't, since they're "undocumented" and get paid under the table, they don't pay ENOUGH to even cover what they take out of the system for education, health care etc.)    And of course, the favorite one, say it all together now:    "YOU'RE A RACIST" (if you're against ALL illegal immigration, you are somehow a racist ... even if you're against illegal immigration from Europe, Latin America and/or Africa and Asia ... makes one pretty much a racist against everyone then ... )    As I've said repeatedly, until someone can prove to me that law breaking on a massive scale is somehow good for the U.S., I'll keep to my anti illegal immigration stance ....|`|1eb720fa74e305437ddc9f84b36217f9aa	You forgot one.

As a OIF Vet, I think every 18 year old male and female should be put in the Military for two year and work oversea in other counrty so that they can learn about the really world. <br>  We have enough problems at home with American without home, food, clothes and the simple thing just too feel like a human being. Grow up!!!!!!|`|VTzIEl0Naa	No, <br>  <br>  1. you'll have no ethical ground to stand on when American flags get flown upside down<br>  <br>  2. it just breeds hate and doesnt resolve or even address your concern<br>  <br>  3.

I think you should wait til you join and have a job and are proficient in that job before you have kids so that you have the time to focus on and learn your job. Amry/Air Force marriage is gonna be harder than Army/Army but it is doable. Army has just as much to offer but they are more in the threat than most AF. I am dual AF by the way. Good luck with this|`|rQG3mk0vaa	It's a bad idea.  Military relationships are notoriously poor with just one member in service.  Both of you being in plus kids would be a disaster.  Do you really feel dying to break up a religious civil war is worth it?

Do something for yourself and future kids, or wait for a worthy cause.   There are better opportunities out there.|`|d7Op6ptVaa	JOIN and make the most of the opportunities that will come your way!!!

The money and benefits alone are worth the enlistment. Plus you can get a free education too. And dependents pay when your kids come along.

She may b:tch about what her parents are "making her do" but, ultimately, she is the one responsible for giving in and doing those things.     I bet you anything that if you offered her a way out (complain to the guidance counsellor, go live with an aunt instead, go out on her own) she would always come up with an excuse not to go ahead with whatever idea you have.     In her head, for whatever reason, she likes being right where she is. If you don't want to go crazy trying to help a girl that really doesn't want it, take a few steps back from the relationship.

AA11340138	First of all let me clarify the situation for those that only speak from what they hear on the TV. Illegals as many call them (Its funny how we don't even call murderers, child abusers illegal but we call those that cross into the US --Misdemeanor-- Illegal), do contribute a lot into the economy. Most end up paying taxes in many forms, sales tax, many illegals own homes and pay property taxes, those that make up social security numbers or use others SSN pay taxes that they never file to get refunds. Those that buy homes will fix the borrowed SSN's credit by paying off their collections and raising their credit scores so they can by homes. By working for cheap they help reduce the price of many items that we Americans use every day. You ***** about $3/gallon gas, how about $3 cabbage, $7/lb tomatoes, how about Motel 6 raising their price to $60 a night instead of $37. The fact is working Americans are getting old and many jobs are being left open. We need new young workers.Illegals put money into SS so the older americans can have health care.  Illegals don't use the health care system as many people claim. I know many that are too scared to go to the hospital or use any public aid. They will visit clinincs and pay cash or got to Catholic charities health centers and pay cash as well. The fact is that Americans themselves are draining the health care system not illegals.  I would stop deportations and raids now!!  give a period of 6-12 months were evey illegal would have to register. Those that don't would face fines or late fees to registered upto 30 days after the grace period. Have all of them go through background checks. Those that are cleared if the can prove they have been here 7+ years and have a family would be given citizenship. 3-6 yrs given residency. Less than 3 given a work permit and have to re-apply to get it again. Guest worker program as many illegals just come to work for a few months and return. Not everyone likes it here. Deport the criminals with violent crimes.|`|df85f95e322e40287a2524ee2c837b96aa	Did you build that soapbox yourself?|`|AA11766242	awwww.....this is almost as good as putting the crying baby in front of the TV camera...|`|AA10738530	That's a helluva haiku from the type of guy who tried to pick up my Home Depot employee wife by pulling up his shirt and showing her his "battle scars" from a weedwacker injury  while repeating "Bonita, Bonita".

And don't cry how poor you are I taught migrant workers.On the average they make $50,000 a year(that was 5 years ago).More then I made teaching them.  Most of that money is sent back to Mexico to pay off houses,buy farms,and helping to run your corrupt government and police.You receive social service and education while you are here even if your an illegal.Illegal children are allowed in our schools and receive free education, breakfast and lunch.  If I go to your country legally ,it would be almost impossible for me to get a job.I can't  buy a house there.  Stop complaining and go back to your country and fix it.We worked hard and are still working hard to fix out government.

Eventually, the neighborhood will also know, as those are public records and accessible to everybody in the United States. People need to know this information, especially if they have small children. Everybody should check their area listings every 6 months at least to be aware of any person in the area. Not to harrass or threaten the offender, but to know that the offender is close to their own home and children. Usually sex offenders are repeat offenders. Seek help.|`|AA10151581	not unless that person had been with children . I know a sex offender that has been in the system for rape.

Now he has to register cause of bad judgement.

The Lefties are the ones doing God's work through the words and prayers of the people.  They are more likely to connect with people on a deep level, have integrity for soulful purposes, and care for those who cannot care for themselves (Jesus) without expecting to get rich.      Bush put our neighbors in dire straights by NOT breaking his back to keep their jobs here in America.  Now, they need help and care... and the "left" is being called "socialist" for wanting to take care of their neighbors.      McCain was driven to deregulate so that a PROFIT could be made easier, not so that the average American could benefit.    Both McCain and Bush are blind to what America needs.

Teachers love democrats. Democrats like to toss huge sums of money into school systems that in the end, makes it into the pockets of the teachers and the administrators. So of course they back the candidate that is going to quench their greed. They fill the young students minds with misinformation about candidates that will not help their call for wealth.|`|OIQvZ87gaa	They are falling for it under false pretenses.

However, I go to university of michigan, which is pretty liberal, and so many people here are like 'obama-bots'. They are pretty much just jumping on the Obama bandwagon because of (imo) empty rhetoric. The thing is though, Obama is obviously a very intelligent and cultured guy, and so that may also appeal to them. However, I don't think that will make him a great president.

Pretty lame defense to claim that he later thought he was reaching for it on his RIGHT hip. And he couldn't tell once he had the weapon in his hand that it was a firearm and not a taser? Really? Those two grips feel exactly alike? And you had to fire on the man lying face down on the ground half a second after you drew the weapon? Really? Either he's the dumbest person to ever wear a cop's uniform or he's lying. He's doing time for manslaughter at the very least.

The jury has to find him guilty and then the judge has to assign prison time.    In my personal opinion, he should be punished.  What an excuse !  Now we might have cops grabbing their gun instead of their flashlights like in a sick comedy show.

We thought (correctly) that they were transporting a large amount of illicit drugs. Not enough for a warrant but enough to stop them when we saw the law was broken. No license, no insurance, tow and inventory search prior to tow found the dope.  When in patrol I rarely stopped anyone less the 15 over. Most of my stops were for poor driving of all sorts, not just speeding.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	To be perfectly honest, it won't matter what the degree is in for most departments unless it's something totally off the wall. Criminal Justice is always a good choice as is public administration. These might be the two most valuable degrees if you are looking to promote.     On a different side, if your looking for a position in the federal government you might want to pursue accounting, law or computers.

And, check this out, all that "bailout" money, that the "federal reserve", is so graciously providing, is collecting interest by the federal reserve, which isn't a "government" bank, it's a private bank, or rather a conglomeration of banks, and the interest comes from tax dollars, so basically we are paying interest on money that we can borrow and pay interest on again, meaning we're paying interest on our own money, so we can pay interest on, our money, that we borrow.  And besides campaign contributions from banks are way better than the ones that the people that vote give.

wROyZFpnaa	This is a standard form RFE for form I-864. Send in as much of the following that you can before the deadline specified on the form.     - Tax transcripts for the last year (at least) and 3 years if possible. Request transcripts by calling 1-800-829-1040. Takes up to 2 weeks to get them.     - Copy of current W2 for the petitioner     - Recent pay stubs since the original submission     - letter from employer if possible, but not necessary if you can get the tax transcripts and W2. Those 2 are the most important.      This form letter always says you have not met the %125 guidelines even if you are well above it. What they really mean is they don't have enough evidence to prove it.      You can call the 1-800 number, but they don't have access to the specifics of your case and they will just repeat what is written on the form. For specific help, make an info pass appointment, but they will pretty much tell you the same.      No matter what, make sure you send what you have by the deadline.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	Is your husband an American?   If you are married to an American there is no reason to worry.

Yes, this is very typical of them, unfortunately.     Now that they are asking for more documents, send them all the possible evidence (bank statements and W-2) you can collect to make sure they accept your application and this won't cause any delay in processing your case. Attach a cover letter to the forms explaining why you have pay stubs for the last 3 months only. They should understand. Good luck!

OTHER DOCUMENTATION- get whatever he was doing then - deployed to Iraq. they should give him oficial letter that that what he was doing for the previous 3 month.

They most closely match my views.  Venus, you are retarded.  The majority of people I know voting for Obama are doing so because he stands for the issues they believe in.  He became the democrat's candidate for a reason.  The educated are more often democrats, so nice try.   If you look at the comments coming from both sides, you will see that the majority of ignorant, unfounded remarks come from the conservative side.  They are the ones that are more likely to have their belief's just because someone told them to.  And notice that I am saying some, not all.  The kool-aid remarks are stupid, and overused.

Just look at the ones who responded to your question when you asked them not to.  They are indicative of the mindset of McCain, pushy, irrational and nauseatingly arrogant.    To answer your question, I took a long time to decide to vote for Senator Obama.  I watched debates closely and I didn't rely on sound bites, but rather his position stated by him, not reconstituted opinions of the media talking heads.  Not the polls.      I honestly think he is the best candidate we have running, and our best chance for redirecting the self-destructive policies we have been burdened with for the past eight years.      I've also watched McCain's antics over the past few weeks.  You shouldn't need stunts and media "wows" to distract the American public if you have real substantive answers and policies to offer.  He doesn't, so that's what he's been up to for the past few weeks.    Let's replay them shall we?   He chose a running mate that is an insult to the intelligence of any American, especially females.  Face it, Palin is Alaskan Barbie and about as dumb as a box of rocks.     McCain said our economy was fundamentally sound.    McCain said our economy was so in the tank he needed to suspend his campaign and rush back to Washington to fix the economic mess.  It was urgent. He was needed. So what was the result of McsuperCain's participation?  Republican's rejected the bailout plan and now new rounds of talks and negotiations will have to commence before we can resolve the crisis of emminent economic doom.    Give me a break.    Why didn't McCain and other republicans stay at the bargaining table long enough to write a bill they knew could pass?  Or maybe things are just not that urgent, huh?  Either way it illustrates his poor ability to lead the country.     Now that I have decided on Senator Obama I am not ashamed to admit that I am both excited and proud that a man of similar heritage to mine has a very good chance to run the country.  However, not for only for the reasons you might think.     It gives me hope that many Americans are ready to transcend an old idea, race hatred, and move on to the future. Like Michelle Obama, who has been denegrated for saying this, I'm proud of my country for the first time in my adult life too.  Like her, it is because for the first time in my adult life I've seen millions of people make a decision to support a man for the highest office in the land because they are politically colorblind enough to pick the candidate that would move our country forward! We can't ignore the fact that this has never happened before, and that's progress.     I am a democrat because while many of them are also just rich politicians, they have always at least supported domestic policies that give the middle class and the poor a chance.    Addition for Kindofcurious:  I read the article from your link.  Senator Obama is not responsible for the tax table in the article.  Go to his website if you want his plans from the horse's mouth.  Here's a clue for you I read at the end of the article: Mr. Boskin, professor of economics at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George H.W. Bush.  Another clue is the article appears in The Wall Street Journal!|`|30SMhlDNaa	They are all being brainwashed by the Media and YA to blindly follow Obama.

There is no stopping them, and those of us who try will by taken out by the M word. They would not care if Obama told him that he hated America and wanted us all dead.

oaesvXtyaa	If the bail-out does not go through some large mortgage companies will fail and the mortgage market will be strained.     Both commercial and residential.    It will be more difficult for less creditworthy borrowers to refinance or get a new mortgage but not impossible, and prices will reflect reality.   That will be one more factor keeping real estate prices down - of course, they're still high relative to ten years ago.    If the bail-out DOES go through there is no guaranty that this won't happen anyway, but what will also happen is runaway inflation.    And the government will send a message to the credit sector - go ahead and do this again because we'll just bail you out again.|`|YqaKgYQ9aa	harder time getting a loan|`|AA10891392	Cash only buddy|`|ucn1VSwqaa	Burning Down The House: What Caused Our Economic Crisis?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RZVw3no2...|`|a055a4721bc914e97e585a34123cdeabaa	Not even the economists know.

The average American does not know how this will affect them, God forbid, until it is too late.    The American economy operates on borrowed money.    Not just individual Americans, but the businesses you work for and the businesses you personally do business with.    Take a large business like GM. GM has hundreds of sub-contractors. Some who borrow money to operate. If the money isn't there they close there doors. People lose jobs. Eventually GM can't bulid cars. GM loses money and people lose jobs. City, State, County and Federal governments lose taxes when people lose job s and can'y buy anything. A foriegn country see an opportunity and buys GM and moves the production offshore.    Multiply that by thousands of businesses large medium and small and what do we have.    Republicans and Democrats, Democrats and Republicans better e-mail or call your Congressional Representatives and Senators and tell them to get it done, now.    
AA12054301	I would like to see some sort universal healthcare. But I have serious doubts about how well it would work, and how it would effect the level of  care in hospitals.   Many low income people on medicaid go to the Emergency Room for absurd reasons that should be taken care of at home. I have witnessed this horrible waste of hospital resources.    Then many working class without insurance do not go because they can't afford doctor's and hospital bills. nobody should die because they feel they can't afford to see a doctor. But it does happen every year, I would have been one of them if I was not a veteran and had VA medical coverage.     I personally did not like either McCain or Obama's healthcare plans. So unfortunately I think this crisis will continue for many more years to come. I really hope I am wrong though, because as I stated nobody should suffer or die due to a lack of coverage.         |`|AA11424005	Health care in the US is not a problem.  You have been duped by BS from the extreme left.  We have health care in the US.  Most people think it is the best in the world.  Everyone has access to health care.      What is at issue is how to pay for it.  Some people have insurance.  Some don't.  Some qualify for the government safety nets.    The main issue in any presidential race should always be national defense/homeland security.  That is the number one job of the government.      No matter how you read the Constitution, there is no provision that even remotely applies to national health insurance.|`|WmgqUYnjaa	I like his plan is better than McCain's but not sure I agree that it's better than Obama's (they are sort of similar)...Too bad we can't pick which plans we want implemented instead of which person...|`|SZ5NZ9uaaa	Bob Barr has the best ideas.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	The problem with health care is cost, not coverage.

AA11262230	Wow, a plant?    Obama came to his neighborhood.  The guy was playing catch on the front lawn with his kid.      Obama approached him.  It was Obama who told Joe "I want to spread the wealth"    But remember, Obama gave a radio interview in 2001 in which he said the Warren Court should have interpreted the Constitution as saying there is a right to spread the wealth but failed to do so.     Obama said the famously liberal Warren Court "wasn't radical enough."    Joe the Plumber was a citizen who tripped up a presidential candidate. That's what makes America so great. |`|G3rMRGcYaa	Im not ready to call him a plant, but I am 100% Positive he was there with a very very Biased Agenda.  After it came out that he donated to Republicans pre question, and some of the other suspicious claims against him make me wonder if he was not tapped or at the very least eager to attempt to stump or hurt Obama.    I just find it very strange that he has turned into a ROCK STAR in the republican ticket literally days after he questioned Obama.|`|k449E7fsaa	You got it right.  He certainly was not a plant.  He's a regular citizen (just like us) that asked a simple, credible question, and got hammered for it later.  Another question to ponder is whether or not "Hidin' Biden" is a plant.  He sure is the "gift that keeps on giving".  He spoke out against Obama, and was adamant about it, even stated once that he would be honored to be McCain's running mate.  Here's another conspiracy question:  Do you think Obama picked Biden to shut him up?  Hasn't worked, has it?  |`|737046554f0960dcd7926cfd6292982faa	A plant?    I know I keep saying it but man are Liberals stupid!  Obama walked up in Joe's yard while He was throwing the football with His Son. So do tell morons here,how is that a plant? I guess McCain bought the house years ago knowing that Obama would lie,cheat and steal enough to get where He is now.Also knowing the You MORONS would actually believe Him and vote for Him. Oh and before one of You idiots say's its one of McCain's 11 houses or something else stupid like that remember McCain bought His houses legally and earned them. He did NOT stoop to obama's level and utilize Tony Resco- felon|`|AA12054301	No. How could the Republicans have known what street or neighborhood Obama would be walking through?  He simply asked a question that Obama did not have a good answer for, and that is forbidden. It should not matter if he was a plant or who he is, it is a legitimate question. Now he gets scrutinized for it.   Also the reporter in Florida was not a plant either, the one who asked Joe Biden the question comparing Obama's policies to a statement by Karl Marx. No question concerning policies should be considered out of bounds. But Biden refused to answer her and refused any more interviews from that news station.   Both questions should be answered and the questioner should not be considered a public enemy for doing so!|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	Joe the plumber never impressed me as being intelligent anyway.

Obama can't take back what he said. Millions of Americans have seen it on camera now. We owe a debt of gratitude to Joe, who directly asked Obama if he planned to tax him more if he were,  at some point  in the future,  to buy and/or expand the business for which he is currently working. And how did the Socialist candidate respond?    "When you SPREAD THE WEALTH AROUND, it's good for everything" - Barack Obama, October, 2008    That's called Socialism, folks.

Turns out that Joe Wurzelbacher from the Toledo event is a close relative of Robert Wurzelbacher of Milford, Ohio. Whos Robert Wurzelbacher? Only Charles Keatings son-in-law and the former senior vice president of American Continental, the parent company of the infamous Lincoln Savings and Loan. The now retired elder Wurzelbacher is also a major contributor to Republican causes giving well over $10,000 in the last few years.     Now I guess we know why Joe is telling the press that Obama is a "socialist" and that the Obama tax plan "infuriated" him. After all, it would hit families like the Keatings and their minions the hardest.    Not to mention that Obama's economic-recovery plan would put the crimps on influence peddlers like McCain's old friends, the Keating Five.    But he sure made for a good one-day story|`|AA12054301	Actually he is just an average citizen who was outside when Barack Obama was walking through the neighborhood taking questions from citizens in that area. He has stated that he wanted to ask Obama a hard question since it seemed that nobody else had. Why do so many Obama hate that so much?  Most do not make that much money but I think that you missed the point of his question. He is thinking about buying a plumbing business. Which means that he would also have other plumbers working for him.   As to why he is bald. How is that relevant to any campaign?

Jesus fed them as an expression of his love, not because they needed to be taught how to fish.  Moreover, our form of goverment is flawed.  True Christians know this.  They also know that God's government will be uncorruptible, which means that Jesus is neither Democrat or Republican.  He represents God's love for all mankind, since all mankind is in need of instruction. |`|04ccfd945c1091db3230b206a589f7cfaa	You need to learn about the conservative traits of a true republician. Our country was started on the beliefs of God and not the people. WE believe that abortion is murder, plain and simple. We believe in one true God and that God intended for marriage to be between a man and a woman and that family is important. We try to have good morals and help others help themselves, not just give free hand-outs from the government so there is not work ethic and pride. True conservatives believe in everything that our forefathers believed in and we want to keep the dream alive in this unstable country we have to live in now. Jesus/God is not pleased with America as it is now and God may take what blessings we have away soon enough in the future.|`|EFQn50a9aa	Jesus wasn't a democrat and CHRISTIANS want someone that isn't going to kill American and i think MCCAIN 2008|`|628459dc9687a2439cf03b64c486141faa	I doubt it. Jesus was a pacifist, so he'd be against pro-choice above anything else.   It just kind of makes sense.   Personally, I think if Jesus were alive today, he'd live and tell mankind "Sorry about your luck, but I'm not going to die for all of your sins. You're on your own. Peace!"  Peace!|`|WoRESIyyaa	The church never wanted government.  So render to Ceasar that which is Ceasars'|`|DMmel4T6aa	I don't think either is a valid point.  Jesus wouldn't tell them to have sex outside of marriage and kill the baby.  He would not promote homosexual marriage.  He would also not approve of greed and hording.     So he would probably say render unto caesar that which is Caesar's and render unto God that whish is Gods.|`|1TU4W4xLaa	First of all I dont really think Jesus would get involved with politics.  He was more of a spiritual leader.  But no I think Jesus would have been a conservative.  Conservatives believe in helping the poor out of their own good will, not by the government mandating it.  That is exactly what Jesus taught.  He also thought tax collectors were the most horrible of sinners. |`|HhNf0SOaaa	I think your assessment would be wrong.   Jesus never preached forcing a rich man to give to the poor. Jesus never preached that a person should sit on his butt on welfare as is illustrated by the parable of the talents. (the parable of the talents had to do with a rich man giving 3 people a bag of money and the one that buried it in the sand was the one that failed)  He wanted us to do our very best and be our very best. He didn't criticize success. He didn't noble-ize poverty. He wanted it all to be our choice. He wanted us to CHOOSE to be good people, not have a government hold us up with threats of the IRS to take care of the poor. For a party that touts choice when it comes to Abortion which Jesus, I am 99% would not support, it eludes me how the Democrats reduce choices when it comes to business, success and personal finance.     Jesus was a teacher, remember and I do believe he tried to teach us to fish. Did he not say we should be fisherman of men? But I don't think Jesus would be a member of either party because Jesus was not a politician. Jesus taught morality and that's something both parties can learn a little about.|`|AA12054301	Actually Jesus fed a with loaves and fish twice, neither time with 40 of each. Once with five loaves and two fish and once with 7 loaves and a few fish (the exact number was not recorded). Also both times were at the ed of a long day and the multitude had followed for quite a while as his popularity and stories of his miracles was growing at that time.   If you would like to know the actual Biblical view of a welfare system study the story of Ruth and Naomi. The government had no welfare system it was considered the responsibility of the family to take of each other. Poor people were taken care of in the Bible but they still earned their money, as shown by the story of Ruth and Naomi. I think it is more similar to the work programs started by Herbert Hoover rather than the handouts given today. The Bible actually speaks out against laziness and men who will not provide for their family.    So, no Jesus would not have been a Democrat. Also other issues would suggest he is not a democrat as well. |`|JY5vABcCaa	Maybe Jesus would be a democrat,(kids are hard to control) But GOD is a republican!

YyTbGI86aa	Definition of theft in England and Wales - Section 1(1) Theft Act 1968:  "A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and thief and steal shall be construed accordingly."    So, in your example, it's not theft for two reasons - you wouldn't be doing it "dishonestly", and in these circumstances it wouldn't be "property belonging to another".    Smithy - Yes, the ticket is valid, and no, the officer wouldn't be illegally parked - all local authority "no waiting" Orders include provisions that specifically permit parking by police officers engaged in enforcement of the restrictions and for police purposes.  However, the majority of local authorities have decriminalised on-street and off-street parking enforcement, so they are no longer enforced by the police, but by their own staff and/or private companies.

hJNwAHccaa	I don't know what your waiver is for but I just talked to a battle buddy of mine who just completed recruiting duty.    If you submitted all the paperwork the recruiter needed in order for him to apply for your waiver, then it may take a while for the waiver to get approved.  If it's been a long while though, his recommendation is to contact the station commander and see what's going on because maybe he's not doing his job because you're not an "easy in."  That's what he says at least.     Waivers do take some time, depending on why it's needed so you should be specific and tell us why the waiver is needed.  It helps others here better answer your question, especially since some people who look at these questions are, in fact, recruiters or former recruiters.|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Honestly I would just go talk to another branch.

Example.  goarmy.com|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Find another recruiter. There are plenty out there. Just go to a different office and explain the situation and see what they say.

AA12054301	His question of citizenship is not just about Kenya. It also involves Indonesia. Senator Obama's own website states that he lived in and went to public school in Indonesia.   I don't know how to check but I have heard that a person must be a citizen to attend public school in Indonesia. If that is true Senator Obama would have had to give up his American citizenship. After giving up American citizenship a person has to go through immigration and then be declared a naturalized citizen even if they were originally born in America.    As for checking credentials before running for political office. A naturalized citizen can hold public. Arnold S became Governor of California.   Also John McCain's citizenship was in question earlier in the election (after 26 years in the Senate), and for him it made the news. Unlike Barack Obama though he immediately provided his birth certificate. John McCain was born on a military base in Panama. Any American military base or embassy in a foreign country is considered America soil. Any foreign embassy's in America is considered part of that country.    Barack Obama has refused to release any of his documents from the University's he attended. This case was opened back in August not just a few days ago and he still refuses to provide a birth certificate. Why refuse to release  any documents unless you are hiding something? Also I saw his birth certificate on his website, it wasn't stamped, any official birth certificate is stamped, the one on his website and the one on factcheck.org are different.    Also marriage certificates and drivers licenses can be obtained by any citizen even illegal immigrants, most states do not check your citizenship status when obtaining one.|`|AA10187742	This and many other facts is the reason why Berg filed suit.

Listen here is the truth    When you run for public office, and you are elected, they put you through several national clearance checks. These are the same checks that you go through when you apply for top secret clearance, like if you apply for and are accepted for a job with the CIA or FBI. I have personal knowledge of this. These checks are very thorough and they contact and interview many members of your family, extended family, close friends, and old employers. In many cases, they perform lie detector tests and background checks. I know this for a fact, because I have done them.    If Obama was not a natural citizen, they would have caught it years ago. Obama is legit, if he were not, he would never have even been considered for state senate of Illinois. These people who perform these checks are the best in the business and the best in the world. They are serious and professional, they would not make a mistake like what you suggest. This is why McCain never raises the question of Obama's nationality, because he knows the process.

No where, except Bergs' filing is there any proof that the grandmother ever said any such thing.   NOTHING THAT BERG CLAIMS is independently verified.     but most important..

You mean that you have an "Unverified Tip" and all that Obama has is an original birth certificate, Marriage certificate, driver's licence, and the clipping from a Hawaiian newspaper showing his birth announcement, all of which have been verified as genuine by experts?    Wow, I guess you sure showed them huh?    Moron.    TV    EDIT - @Chios78 - Finally! Someone using some actual rational arguments. I may not agree with you but I deeply respect the fact that you have not chosen to swallow the more outlandish and patently untrue rumours. It speaks well of your intelligence and common sense.    In response to your comments...    I have just taken a look at the certificates on FactCheck.org and Obama's web site and the two look identical to me. What is it exactly about the two that are different?    Also, the certificate is stamped (the stamp is on the back which I believe is , or at least was, standard practice).    As for Obama's citizenship... It is a matter of public record that he attended an Indonesian school between the ages of 6 and 10 and that it is possible (though not certain) that he was required to be considered an Indonesian citizen to attend. However, while this would have resulted in Indonesia no longer recognizing his US citizenship, importantly, it would NOT have resulted in the US no longer recognizing it. As far as the US is concerned, he is a natural born US citizen and, although he may (or may not) have held dual US/Indonesian citizenship at one time, he has always been a US citizen.    It is also a fact that from the ages 0 (birth) to 2 he held dual US/British citizenship (Kenya was a UK colony until 1963) and, after that, he held dual US/Kenyan citizenship until his 21st birthday (when his Kenyan citizenship lapsed).    Despite all this, he is most certainly a natural born US citizen and has never given up his US citizenship (at least in the eyes of the US). He is therefore eligible to run for president.    You are correct about McCain being born in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936 but, although the base that he was born on is nominally US soil, most experts in this area of the law contend that, while he is certainly a US citizen, he probably does not qualify as a "Natural born US citizen" and is therefore, probably not strictly eligible to run for president. This is partially due to the fact that the law making all children born to US parents in the PCZ, US citizens was not passed until 1937, about a year after McCain was born and there are doubts about whether or not this is retroactive.     However, the case has never been tested in court and probably never would be (If he was found to be ineligible, there would be huge problems in posting military personnel overseas) and, besides, while he may be ineligible to run under the letter of the law, the spirit of the law probably never intended to disqualify people in his position.    Still, it's an interesting point of law.|`|xSZD7JeUaa	I don't think that there is anything wrong with Obama's birth certificate.

252488faa61d45ab5dd0a3a3b86bd138aa	The history of term limits dates to FDR, who was elected to four terms, and died in office. The Twenty-second Amendment (Amendment XXII) of the United States Constitution sets a term limit for the President of the United States. The United States Congress passed the amendment on March 21, 1947.    Historians point to George Washington 's decision not to seek a third term as evidence that the Founders saw a two-term limit as convention and a bulwark against a monarchy; his Farewell Address, however, suggests that it was because of his age that he did not seek reelection. Thomas Jefferson also contributed to the convention of a two-term limit; in 1807 he wrote, "if some termination to the services of the chief Magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution, or supplied by practice, his office, nominally four years, will in fact become for life." Jeffersons immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe, also adhered to the two-term principle.    Prior to Franklin D. Roosevelt, few Presidents attempted to serve for more than two terms. Ulysses S. Grant sought a third term in 1880 after serving from 1869 to 1877, but narrowly lost his party's nomination. Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency upon William McKinley's assassination and was elected in 1904 to a full term himself, serving from 1901 to 1909. He sought to be elected to a (non-consecutive) third term in 1912 but lost to Woodrow Wilson. In 1940, FDR became the first person to be elected more than twice; supporters cited the war in Europe as a reason for breaking with precedent. In the 1944 election, during World War II, he won a fourth term, but died in office the following year.    After Roosevelt's death, the newly Republican 80th United States Congress desired to establish a firm constitutional provision barring presidents from being elected more than twice. The rationale was a concern that without limits, the presidential position could become too similar to that of a benevolent dictator lasting not just four years but a lifetime, and that the position could become too powerful and upset the separation of powers. Hence, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted.    Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed concern over the erosion of a second-term president's power and influence, as the president becomes a political lame duck. The term was coined by 18th century English stockbrokers to mean someone who is bankrupt, but later came to mean anyone who has been made weak and ineffective. It now most often applies to politicians who are soon to leave office. This effect was referred to by President George W. Bush when, after winning his second term, he told the media "I'm going to come out strong after my swearing-in. We have to move quickly, because after that I'll be quacking like a duck."    The true patriot is an informed voter.|`|q8UshwzZaa	read your history book  after FDR was elected a 4th time, they passed a new amendment|`|5Wc1vDshaa	So they cannot concentrate power and influence.|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	Fear of our Democracy becoming a dictatorship.

Highly unlikely - I worked for the 4th largest law firm in the country and every one of those people knew one another. Our office encompassed 4 floors of a rather large building and conferences at least once a week included everyone - 67 attorneys, 7 main partners and all of the office staff, paralegals.... I am not buying and even if given the benefit he met and became friendly with Ayers and his wife - maybe he didn't know about Ayers past - when did he find out? Why won't he answer simple questions?  Not one association, a pattern - Rezko, Johnson, Ondingo, Wright, Flagler,,, we all know there are more we just haven't heard about them yet...  As for Bush... an oil family that is associated with an oil family - shocking! Not big news really, Did Bush start his political career in their living room? Did he take the wife's place in the local gov't? Have money funneled in to shady activities sponsored by them?

But you must realize that Obama is something like the 36th son in that family.  The number is not correct but the meaning is in the right direction.  American presidents have been close to Saudis ever since WWII.  There is a slight difference to being friends with someone who is related to a bad guy and actually being friends with the bad guy himself.    Obama got fund raisers from Bill Ayers (who is a self admitted terrorist) and then funneled 20 million of tax payers to organizations that Bill Ayers supports.    Obama claimed Rev Wright was his spiritual mentor and wright has no spirit, he is a mean hearted racist.    Obama aided this guy in Kenya who after he lost the election went around performing ethnic cleansing.    Do you see any difference in the associations ?|`|Pv9ALQfpaa	That would assume that all republicans believe he is a terrorist.... I am not included in that all...     However... I do believe that he is friends are quite questionable in their philosophies alone.... I really don't care that Ayers bombed the Pentagon... that is ancient history... however the philosophies that he holds are not ones that I agree with and unless Obama is just a hermit and never talks to the people he works with I have to believe that Ayers and Obama have had many a conversations together.... and it's the philosophies that Obama may hold now as a result that scare me...    That and the fact that he wants to negotiate with Iran with no preconditions, as stated on his website... that in and of itself is scary right there...  and that is one of many reasons I am not voting for Obama. |`|B0YOtUCdaa	There is a saying like this: "He who runs with wolves, learns who to howl."

After all if a candidate supports the goals and objectives of an organization it is only obvious that the organization would support the candidate. In past campaigns, the candidates have presented friends and associates from their past.     John Kerry introduced Swift Boat veterans from the Viet Nam War. John McCain introduced fellow POWs from a Viet Nam prison. Obama has only presented fellow politicians that support his positions. Where are the friends from Obamas past?       If the CPUSA supports Obama, the curious voter would ask why. What is there is Obamas past that would be attractive to the CPUSA? So I began to look for Obamas skeletons. I discover that Barack Obama had a close association with numerous noted Socialists and Communists.     For example:  Saul Alinsky was a well-known Communist sympathizer in Chicago. Alinsky was considered the father of community organizing and urged using existing established institutions such as churches, unions and political parties to slowly create the social paradise Marx, Engels, and Lenin envisioned. As a community organizer, Obama utilized Alinskys methods to accomplish Change.

7PTZJ74vaa	Do we have time yes do we have a chance of stopping it no. This vote is already in the bag, it will come down to party lines. Congress and the President are committed and convinced of the proposition that spending ourselves out of this hole is the only way out. They have yet to realize you can not borrow your way out of debt, you have to work your way out. In this age of instant gratification that will just never do. After the French revolution the French sent observers to see how our country made democracy work. One of these men was named Alexis de Tocqueville, he was a scholar and historian. Two of his most famous quotes follow;  1.The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public's money.  2.America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.

It is 40 years of democrat dreams all piled in one bill. Finally they get to unleash the tide. This tide will be your downfall.

This bill and the actions already taken by the new Obama regime has already demonstrated Obama's lack of backbone  when it comes to machine politics.  He has obviously caved in to factions that got him elected and payed them back in the first week.  This bill is just another paycheck to the people who put the blinders on the public.    I get some hope by the opposition to such a bill.  We can make a difference if we all try our best to voice our opinions.  Maybe America isn't a country of idiots like Obama seems to think.  Maybe he shouldn't pander to the rest of the worlds opinion.  Maybe he should consider the opinions of the thinking people of America who don't think that he is the solution to all of their problems.  But he won't.... the candidate who got elected on a message of hope is now legislating on a campaign of fear!  my god!
EFeBr0T4aa	Mate, Operating and Maintaining tanks can lead to a great civilian job. After you get your certifications. If you learned how to maintain, operate and drive a Challenger 1 or 2 or a Warrior. After you finish your Military Service send your resume to B.A.E. or General Dynamics in the states. These are high paying civilian jobs. When B.A.E. sells say Challengers to another country. It's B.A.E. that will send civilian instructors and mechanics to train and maintain the tanks until the buyer can do these things themselves. Tanks, Artillery are high priced items. Even if you didn't try for defense contracting. You could work on heavy construction equipment or be an operator. How many people can go to a construction employer and Truly say I have operated a 5 to 10 million dollar machine and have certificates that prove it. Plus if you go to Afghanistan you can prove you work well under pressure. I spent 29 months working in Iraq as an Iraqi Special Projects Coordinator. For a small Kuwaiti company. They had a contract in Kuwait to repair damaged Hummers from Iraq. About half the workers were American the other half were from England. Their Salary was huge. They had nice free housing, food allowance, some even got to pick what kind of car or suv the company would lease for them. Go for it mate.  Regards,|`|D8I3Brngaa	i would advice against you joining the army at all because your country's government isn't worthy of your service.  when they start respecting individual liberty and stop trying to mold society in their own desired image then it would be worth fighting for.|`|GxeSTBKkaa	If you're looking to get out after your enlistment and have a skill than I think it's a bad idea. If you want to stay in or don't care how useful it is a civilian then thertes nothing wrong with that. Alot of jobs in the military aren't any good when you get out, so it's best to get a degree or work on it in service. I can say there are much worse MOS in the army and as long as you can see yourself doing that than go for it.

According to this bill one will need a FEDERAL License to own a firearm... ANY handgun, and ANY semi-automatic firearm.

AA12054301	It is very different. Religion or lack of any religion is the basis of our moral characters and our values. Everybody makes decision based on their own values, and what is the most important issues to them. Religion is just one thing that helps shape the values of many. Religion is a constant choice.   Race and gender can not not be changed and is not a reflection on the person's character or values. So yes it is very different.    Dr. Martin Luther King said that each person should be judged by the content of their character not the color of their skin. That is very good words that should be remembered. Nobody should vote for or against anyone based on race.   |`|AA10873763	Very similar.  Good point.

They usually vote for the one they think will win, instead of who would be the best to represent their own interests.    It is also hard for people who do very little or no research to know there are better options.  For one, the 2 major parties tend to lie a lot and make the average Joe think that one or the other is the better choice for them, when in reality they are just 2 masks on the same face.|`|XJigtEiKaa	Well, you could start by NOT voting for the wealthy, and the way to do that would be to have congress enact a law that says if a man or woman wants to serve public office, they have to give all of their holding above 100,000 to the people, just as a show of good faith, and work for a salary of no more than 50,000 a year (with no  exceptions ala Dick Cheney allowed)...    Now of course getting the congressmen, who are mostly multimillionaires to go along with this could be difficult. But it's just about the only way you'll change the picture.

They also get stuck with bills that often have something great and something horrible in them, so when they vote they either have to vote against the great thing or for the horrible thing... or just vote present.    There may be some better candidates out there, but how many of them honestly want to have everything about them and about their families become national fodder?  How many want Jay Leno making jokes about their age, or what they did twenty years ago, or (worse yet) stuff about their spouse and children?

hmA8nfA2aa	Requirements and how you become a police officer vary depending the state and the department. Check out the Minnesota State Patrol's website. Also check out the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards & Training's website. If you want to become a police officer, one of the best things that you can do is to earn a college degree. As far as education goes, some police departments only require their officers to have a high school diploma or GED. Some police departments require their officers to have a two year degree or equivalent. Some police departments require their officers to have a four year degree or equivalent. Even if a particular department does not require a degree, you will have a better chance of getting hired if you have one. Some departments pay their officers more if they have a degree. Having a degree could also benefit you when trying to get promoted after you become a police officer. Choose a major that interests you and that would be useful for police work. Criminal justice, psychology, forensic science, a foreign language, accounting, and computer science are some good examples. While in college, learn as much as you can, and earn the highest GPA that you can. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer. Good luck!|`|emNCaAq7aa	http://www.realpolice.net/how-to-become-...    Check out that site and   officer.com    both also have listings from different departments outlining the qualifications needed.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Ask any local policeman.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	To be a police officer you have to apply to a department that is hiring. To be successfully hired you would need to at least meet all the minimum requirements. Some departments require a college degree while others do not.     You can check what the minimum requirements are by checking each departments website usually under recruiting. Some cities, counties, states etc may list job openings in law enforcement under human resources or personnel. Once you determine what the minimums are you can work towards meeting them.    You might want to think about joining the Coast Guard reserves because this will give you experience and training in law enforcement and help give you an edge on the competition. Plus you will be able to get some money for college.
Q5cLaYPgaa	On "The Voice of Victory" this morning they said that the Bible provides a complete economic plan for the USA including variable tax rates - and if we don't follow it God will destroy us all so vote McCain.    They are completely insane - why do we give them tax free status?|`|7W34uvyyaa	Amen to that.  I personally don't care about gay marriage, it's not gonna free up any men for me to marry.   not letting them marry won't make them less gay.  And that is basically how I feel about all of that stuff.  I care about, jobs, healthcare, alternative energy, education, and peace.  the fact that somebody does or does not have an abortion is not my business.  Now helping them to eat if they decide to have the child, I'm all for that.    Red: America was not founded on Christian Principles, that is why the founding fathers created separation of church and state.  Up until that time, every nation had an official religion.  They separated church and state to ensure that no one religion would be given precedence in America, while they were raised Christian, they did not establish this as the official religion of America which they could have easily done.|`|AA12054301	To me moral issues are more than just talking points, it is a way of life. My stance on the two issues you have mentioned are this.   Abortion, I would allow abortions for cases of rape and to save the life of the mother. But both cases must be proved or else women would claim they were raped or dying just to get an abortion. These abortions account for about 5% of all abortions. The rest are just unwanted or "bad timing" for the mother. How selfish is that?   Gay marriage, I do not bash gays an lesbians or speak out against them. I feel it is wrong, but I do not try to push my values on anyone. I do however get when others try to push their values on me. Both Presidential candidates (during the final debate) agreed that the definition of marriage should remain as between one man and one woman. This "gay-christian" movement is against God, that is when I started getting really aggravated with the liberal agendas.   I look at all the issues but I will not support any candidate who is for all for abortion for social reasons. |`|zHQVlXd5aa	what is the difference?|`|2qQPBDlkaa	look around at what making them NOT social issues has caused.. school shooting out of control crime .. should i go on?!?!      when a society has low moral fibre.. it rapidly falls apart study history and you will find this to be true..     when will liberals understand that Morals ARE the backbone of any legal system.. if we as a society don't ahve morals our laws will fail!  |`|VNZFwdEkaa	screw God.

As one of the founders of the Non-aligned Movement, he was an important figure in the international politics of the post-war era. He is also referred to as Pandit Nehru ("pandit," Sanskrit, "scholar", as honorific) and in India, as Panditji (-ji, honorific suffix).    The son of the wealthy Indian barrister and politician Motilal Nehru, Nehru became a leader of the left-wing of the Indian National Congress at a remarkably young age. Rising to Congress President under the mentorship of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru was a charismatic, radical leader, advocating complete independence from the British Empire, and was eventually recognised as Gandhi's political heir. A life-long liberal, Nehru was also an advocate for Fabian socialism and the public sector as the means by which long-standing challenges of economic development could be addressed.    Serving as Congress President, Nehru raised the flag of independent India in New Delhi on 15 August 1947, and served as Prime Minister. His daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi would both also serve as Prime Minister and President of the Indian National Congress whereas Rajiv's wife Sonia Gandhi would also become the President of the Indian National Congress and a key figure in Indian politics. His long tenure was instrumental in shaping the traditions and structures of independent India.|`|qYrRwdZsaa	Jawahar Lal Nehru was India's 1st prime minister|`|gObe0nY4aa	PT.

Your average person could do a lot more with that kind of money.  Very wasteful.  That said, we're in a crisis, brought about by 8 years of seriously blowing money in another country on another continent.  None of that money helped Americans, and that spending/ deficit led to this mess.  If the money is going to be spent (and it always is, no matter who is in office), I'd much rather see it spent in America, on American infrastructure and American programs, in an attempt to get our economy back on track, versus the wasteful spending of billions we saw on Iraq over the last 8 years.    I will happily support national park maintenance, Smithsonian museum maintenance, energy research, road improvements, healthcare improvements, and tax credits.  For the record, someone on welfare wouldn't benefit from a tax credit, as they wouldn't be eligible for taxing.

DY9NOh4taa	The simplest answer to that is he doesn't care about the American taxpayer's who have to pay the utility bills for the White House. He is sitting there enjoying 90 degree temperature, while there are homeless and jobless people who do not have that luxury. People who are dying on a daily basis, because they do not have a home or shelter to go to, many shelters are at capacity or above for the entire winter because the of the colder temperatures this winter.  The National Weather Service, has called this one of the coldest winters on record, setting records in some states, and other states that normally enjoy 40-50 degree lows are seeing lows around or under zero, for the first time in decades in some cases.  There are also people who live in the northern part of the country that have heating bills so expensive that they have to make a choice between keeping warm or eating.  Obama came to Washington from Chicago, and aside from the vacation that he took in Hawaii, after the election, the rest of the time, he was either in Washington or Chicago, where the temperature has been cold almost the entire winter.  Once again Barack Obama is slapping the very people who voted for him in the face saying, look at me I am nice and cozy, while you are freezing to death.  Obama needs to make up his mind either he is from Chicago or he is from Hawaii, he can't have it both ways, and if he is from Hawaii, what was he doing as a Junior Senator from Illinois.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	Do you people have meetings to make up this crap or do you all just do it on your own?|`|ehjKpv0Waa	Bush just purchased a 3 million $ home, why, when others are losing their home because of his leadership.

If only the sore losers were hate mongers,  it would stop working against getting this nation back on its feet.

The entire point to investment banking is to make as much money as possible, not provide some kind of public benefit or charity.  They were very good at making money for a long long time, do you really think this economic mess was their intention?  This hurts them in the place they're most sensitive, the bottom line.  People are getting laid off right and left on Wall St just like throughout the rest of the US.  People are putting the blank solely on banks and while they are partly responsible, we should also blame the lack of regulation and oversight that allowed them to risk this much.  Why are we bailing them out?  Because if they go down, we go down.  We have a capitalist nation and in order to stay a capitalist nation, we need to keep these banks afloat so they can give money to companies that employ people, lend money to people buying homes and cars, and growing our economy.  It's not like the money is going to something will provide no benefit to anyone outside of banking.  That said, yes the money needs to come with regulations, "Greed," is what runs our economy from my, "Greed," of wanting a paycheck to a company's, "Greed," to make money, the invisible hand is the reason capitalism works, but we as a country have a responsibility to impose and enforce the rules for this game so we can all play nice.|`|diCASlUXaa	The part where Republicans cry.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Yeah!

These people (mostly blacks and hispanics) did not pay off their loans, which resulted in banks becoming fearful of giving out credit.  Thus, business operations cease.|`|Uo5wYDklaa	No one will answer those, you know why? its affermitive action that did it.    There is a law on the books right now that you must give X amount of loans to minorities, and that when dealing with the minorities, you are not allowed to look at credit history. Fannie and Freddie are not allowed to run a credit report.    We have laws that force the banks to give loans to what is considered a high risk person, the bank has to. Then they try to sell those high risks off to people in packages, and when everyone ends up with the high risk, they go bankrupt.

We can safely eliminate a lot of stuff that gives us no benefit.

Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.     [Here, it does not mean spousal or parental abuse. It means violence by Americans rather than foreigners.]    Amendment IX    The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

No more left leaning moderates and core value back stabbers like McCain. Those that defected the party can stay gone.  Unions have hurt America more than helped, they can continue to exist because they have helped a few, but they are only 12% atm and have been steadily dropping due to the interference they have with companies.  Schools need to get their act together, Being in california show's me that the teachers unions are too big and powerful. We along with other states pay the most per capita student and are among the worse scores. Kids need to get back to good old fashioned hard work with if nothing else the realized threat put on their heads that society isn't responsible for them, that they influence their future more than anything...and that knowledge is power, and if they want to stumble through the future uneducated...that is their right as an American but don't expect society to pick up their tab. But said more motivationally of course. There's things in life we all don't like to hear, but we are on the tipping point of the self rightout, corrupt and ideological idiots trying to elevate themselves over the populus. Too many lazy, stupid, uneducated, unmotivated trying to live off the fat of the land....and in todays economy...there isn't a lot of fat to go around.  Social Security changes have been attempted...and good plans shot down due to political pressures and mis information.  Personally i think its time to dispatch the 2 party system.  Force truth in ad campaigns regarding those that flat out lie on TV.  Hold the media accountable for the things they leave out and those with specific agenda's that push citizens into their line of thinking.  Corporation regulation hasn't been a problem as much as it has been the enforcing of those regulations. Too many times we see things not getting done for the people based on political agenda's, grabs for power and positioning.  Its time citizens....all citizens get what they should from government, less interference, less BS, backtalk and corruption. Its time the government gets a class on customer service and a reminder that they are suppose to work for us. They need this insulative barrier they have been working on to be stripped down, and fired for cause when they fail to do their jobs or prison sentences for when they really mess up bad.  The enviro whacko's need to stop getting all the press and endless insane commercials whining about drowning polar bears be removed due to the lies in the campaign. 75% of the polar bears live in Canada, and the population has quadrupled since the 50's. I'm not targetting the green movement......if you want to save money and save energy that fine...but to lie openly on TV to garner support of a cause that isn't real...that's a lie...that's a waste of time, money, resources and doesn't need to be on the air.  The standards of weighing things based on facts, data and science should stiffle all the BS and lie promotions we see or hear on TV, radio and the like.  Government must decrese, wasted money like $14 billion to foreign aid must decrease...perhaps an international rescue fund that all contribute to for hurricane relief or drouts...  International community support regarding terrorism world wide and rescuing of autrocity struck countries like Africa agreed upon prior to so there won't be the political squirming like we saw for Iraq.  A new "geneva" convention drawn up that all are recommended to sign...those not signing won't be guaranteed support or relief if they can't be part of the civilized world and renounce oppression and terrorism and humane treatment.|`|o9dMd2rBaa	*Limited time of Welfare for those who have lost jobs and are physically and mentally able to work again. No permanent welfare except for those who physically and mentally unable to work  *Police is up to the states and cities, not the Federal Gov other such as FBI, US Marshals and that  *Eliminate the Department of Education. That is up to the States and the local districts, not the Federal Gov  *Downsize the Department of Housing and Urban Development  *Cut Taxes  *No handouts to businesses. If they fail, let them fall flat.   *Give Tax incentives for businesses for every employee they hire, therefore creating more jobs  *Dissolve unions and give more responsibility to Department of Labor to ensure proper work conditions. So if one worker is works 2 times better than another worker, why should that other worker get the same wages?  *Regulation of wages/bonus of corporate executives, to ensure they don't bring down the business. But the rest is up to the business, so if they make a poor business decision, that's up to them, not the government  *Take military action if it is in the best interests of the United States, even if the United Nations disagrees. However, wars without UN support needs to be of a defensive nature (1 country being invaded by another and US helping to defend the country being invaded) or of a counter offensive nature. So if for example Iran decided to take the US, then the US has green light to go to war against Iran. No Imperialist wars such as the Spanish American War and Mexican American  War. So no going to war purely for economic and political reasons unless the UN supported it.   *No universal health care system. What may work for one person might not work for another. So allow people to choose the health care system that works best for them  *Allow banks to decide whether or not to issue loans. It is the Democrats of the 90s fault for banks lowering their standards and giving loans to more riskier people. So if a bank decides a person is risky for loan, they have the right to deny them. Since if the bank gave out TONS of loans to people unable to pay them back, the bank goes under.   *Increase funding for Army, Marines, slightly decrease funding for Navy and downsize a lot of funding for Air Force

Many of Obama's supporters said that the reason to vote for him was because he was black, not because of any policy he advocated (of course, Obama was virtually identical to McCain in policy, so the Democrats had no other case to make for Obama).  During the primaries, the Obama campaign was sexist toward the Clinton campaign (of course, Obama ran to the left of Clinton during the primary and to her right during the general election).  Democrats also made many sexist comments about Sarah Palin.    On the Republican side, there were racists, especially in the deep south, who were falsely claiming that Obama is a Muslim.  There were also sexist comments directed toward Hillary Clinton during the primaries.  However, the Democrats, the supposed party of "tolerance" were far worse.|`|sVym9MjFaa	Racist = The Democrats = Bill Clinton    Sexist = The Republicans refusing to vote for a gay US President = Giuliani|`|2CxfFENRaa	The Democrats, They were sexist towards Palin and Hillary, and the Black people were racist by voting for color.|`|FX4WhQtKaa	all parties are sexest and racist....that's why they choose a party isn't it?....to not be part of the other party..... only true independants can claim to be civil because they have chosen not to consider themselves better than another group|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Democrats....just look at the Huffington Post and MSNBC articles about Palin and Republicans|`|8C9yJ0Bwaa	Neither.

The White House puts it on YouTube to get the message out to the people who watch YouTube, because those morons don't watch the real news.    LIKE I SAID - SOMEONE EDITS IT.

Kh4p4gPXaa	1  A 23 year old in a car with a 14 year old after dark is suspicious.   You were pulled over for a valid reason (broken taillight).    How did he know that you did'nt threaten her into saying that she was your sister?   If it was your missing sister in the car under duress,  you'd be pissed at the officer for believing that "shes my sister" excuse instead of checking further.   He checked further,  and yes,  it took awhile,  but thats part of his job.     2  How do you know what was going on?   A crime might have occurred in the area,  and you matched the description of the one accused of committing it.   You were running away,  that always looks suspicious,   they would definitely check you out.   Demanding ID is standard procedure,  after all,  they don't know if you have 15 warrants out for violent crimes.   After all,  if you were mugged in the alley,  how would you feel if the one who did it ran right by police who did nothing because "it would inconvenience the guy if he didn't do it."     3)   Public parks are great for drug deals and all sorts of illegal activity.   You were also asleep,   were you drunk,  injured?   You were reported as suspicious,  the search merely was to make sure you weren't any harm to anyone (protect the public)     4)  Middle of the night,   empty parking lot,  and your fumbling for your keys beside your car.   You could be fumbling,  drunk,  or a thief.   He conducted a brief check to make sure it was your car and let you go.    Its not harassment or annoyance,  its active crime prevention.   If they waited for crimes to be committed before doing anything,  the streets would be a dangerous place.  Lets look at what could have happened:     1) A 14 year old girl could have been violently raped and/or murdered,  and might have been prevented if the background check didn't check out (since he would've taken the guy in)     2) A guy was shot and killed in a barfight,  and an armed criminal is at large,  because the police didn't want to inconvenience anyone by stopping a suspicious individual     3) A drug smuggling ring that could be selling drugs out of the park to your children could have been dealt a blow,  because of a report and a followup that could lead to a large stash of drugs being discovered.     4)  They would have a stolen vehicle report the next morning,  and nothing they could do because even though they had a patrol car right there,  the police didn't want to inconvenience anyone.    Put yourself as the victim in these four above scenarios,   they have happened repeatedly in history,  and have been prevented by cops like the ones who stopped you.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	I dont see any problem with what the officers did in any of those situations|`|iRg1vyHcaa	Well you've given four examples of good pro-active policing there.    1 - You were stopped for a valid reason. The cop then saw a 23 year old male in a car with a 14 year old girl. That late at night it looked suspicious. He carried out the necessary checks and let you go, granted the checks ended up taking a while but the cop did everything in his power to protect the welfare of your little sister. You would have been the first to complain if you're sister was with a 23 year old man who was taking advantage of her and the police did nothing. Have you thanked him yet? Didn't think so.    2 - How do you know that an incident hadn't occurred nearby and been reported. Then they saw you running. It looked suspicious. If the Police did not stop people who act suspiciously then all sorts would slip the net. Again how much complaining would you do if you were a shopowner and CCTV showed a man smash your window then leg it straight past some Police who did nothing.    3 - You were meeting up with a friend in a car park in the middle of the night. The police had received a report of a 'suspicious vehicle' and they checked you out. People often drive to secluded spots late at night to carry out illegal activities. Would you not have been more surprised if the police had allowed you to carry on acting suspiciously without doing anything?    4 - You were stood next to a car late at night fumbling about for keys. You could have been drunk or a car thief. The police did a quick check and allowed you to go on your way. They were trying to stop someone who they believed may have been stealing YOUR CAR!!! Again have you thanked them for that? Again I didn't think so.    It's not called making trouble or harassing and annoying it's called pro-actively looking for and therefore preventing crime. You are the first person I've ever met who would like the Police to do less work. Maybe they should actually sit in the station all night and eat donuts!|`|lTNcvqyHaa	You know - you have just demonstrated that the Police do in fact do what they have been trained to do. Put the boot on the other foot for a while and see it from the 'To protect person and property and uphold the law.    1) 14 yo female in car, with 23 yo male, picked up maybe 200 klms from home, late at night. (I would hope if it were my daughter or sister the Police would check it out - just a pity it took so long for your parents to get home)    2) 23 yo male running full pelt down the road from a night club. I would hope they would stop a could be perp. - robber, assault, etc. OR if you were running away from someone after you wouldn't you want them to help you)    3) The Police were following up on a "reported suspicious vehicle " loitering in a public park - ( they were doing their job following up on a report and protecting the public)    4) Fumbling for keys in an isolated parking lot, near a single vehicle , looks like someone breaking into the vehicle - (once again just doing their job)    You know - you should look at the pattern of your actions and behaviour -  you shouldn't be in a car with a minor without both having ID, don't pelt down a street maybe jog, don't sleep in your car in a public park, get you keys out early and be ready to get straight into your own car. If you did all these things you would actually be safer from harm yourself.    Just the wrong guy in the wrong place, doing the obvious 'strange' things.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Well some of those thing you were doing from an officers perspective might seem suspicous depending on where you did it.    1. Your not a criminal so you probably don't know where the high crime areas are.  Some places at day loo fine and there are no shootings but at night become crime heavens.  Maybe you were driving through pedophile alley, or maybe you didn't look related  2.You know that suspicious to a cop.  Even if your innocent seeing a guy run down the street like hell just looks suspicious  3.Thats just bad luck.  If mall security or some neighbour or even some kid with a cell phone calls the cops they come  4. Could have been in a car theift hot spot.  Hey if you were a car theif were would you steal a car from? Empty lot right.  Your fumbling for keys could look like fumbling for a weapon to break into a car with.    Just the fact that half your stories start off with 2 in the morning doesn't surprise me that you have these experiences.  I don't think the cops are harassing you, unless it is in the same area or same cop, or unless you made a Fvck the police song that on every radio ststaion..    Ya too bad though cops didn't spend more time catching real criminals arther than just chasing around innocent minoties who they think look suspicious|`|cbIxKGZVaa	Wait till someone in your house gets shot and officers responding see someone running in your neighbor, I hope they just assume he is getting exercise and don't question him and why he is running in the neighbor    It's called crime prevention buddy    Seriously you really have to ask these question the majority were late at night (when break ins and robberies mainly occur) and in remote empty areas IE sleeping in a public park where I don't know a drug transaction could occur, seriously get a clue|`|AA11494150	An officer is taught to look for things out of the ordinary. Every one of your examples begin with something unusual. Investigation is not a perfect science, so you often need more information to make an informed decision.     I see nothing wrong with any of your examples, other than possibly the time frame. which you cited at 45 minutes for  1 and 30 minutes for  2. However, it sounds like your parents were the cause for the delay in the first incident, not the officers. A school ID with the same last name as yours would have prevented that.    You should contact your local department and see if they offer ride along programs. Once you see what type of people are out at 2am, you may even appreciate their efforts.    No, the police do not need to see a crime in progress to act. The burden of proof required to detain someone is a "reasonable suspicion". This is defined as something that would lead a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence to suspect something may be wrong.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	you must have "the look".|`|OI7eeIreaa	Never talk to the cops.  Always ask, "Am I free to go?"  Unless they are arresting you, you can't be detained without your consent.  You caved to their demands without utilizing your rights.  Always push them with, "Am I being detained?"  Watch the attached source.  It's good.|`|93M8Vccvaa	I don't see the problem. Every incident that you gave made you look suspicious. The police are trained to look for suspicious activity and you fit the bill even though after investigating it was determined you had done nothing wrong. The police were just doing their job. Nothing harassing in what they did.

One thing I think people often forget is that candidates say whatever the people need or want to hear during the race, but once they win and get into office, you're forgotten. They always have their own agenda. As I've said before. Politicians never say what they mean and they never mean what they say. They say what they need to just to get your vote and that's about all they care about.     Are people just NOW realizing that Obama is just a politician like the rest of them?     He doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about the families freezing to death!

The Red Cross was serving at least 10,000 meals a day, spokesman Brian Quail said. ]    [Of the state's 120 counties, 78 have declared emergencies, the governor's office said, as have about 47 cities.]    [ The Kentucky National Guard boosted to 1,000 the number of soldiers aiding recovery efforts.    Three of the battalions were heading to Paducah, Owensboro and Benton in the west and others headed to other hard-hit spots.    The state said the Federal Emergency Management Agency will operate out of a National Guard center in Frankfort.]    [ Beshear {Kentucky Governor} praised the Obama administration's prompt reaction to the storm. Obama declared parts of the state a federal disaster area Wednesday evening.    "They really hit the ground running," he said. "They're working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need." ]|`|4TgxrCX4aa	The response to the ice storm has received very little coverage while the super bowl party is getting more than it deserves and while this might be a pr blunder, I find it refreshing that we have a president who sees America as one crisis after another and frames his presidency as a series of disasters.  As long as the appropriate response is being taken and it appears it is, I don't need to hear about.  I think the response to this super bowl party thing is focusing too much, "Obama's throwing a party," and not enough on the fact that the guest list isn't filled with personal friends or the good ole boys from back home, it's congressmen from both sides of the aisle.  It's another step in the process of breaking down the bitter divides between the political parties and getting them to talk to each other.  Even if no business is brought up at the gathering which I seriously doubt, the goodwill of these senators socializing outside the capitol might actually allow them to work together inside it, just a thought.|`|7WpXJtqCaa	Haha  what he said during his campaign and what he is doing now, are the exact opposite!

How many Nuclear Ballistic Submarines do we need? Who the hell are we gonna launch a full scale attack on? We need military spending, but we need armoured vehicles and stuff to detect IEDs.

Liberals seem to think all Republicans have a white, hooded robe in the back of their closet.  But I know for a fact that there are many bigoted Democrats as well.    The liberals often accuse Conservatives of hating the poor just because they don't agree with the liberals' plans for helping the poor.  But the facts are the conservatives donate much more money to help the poor than the liberals do.

If Al Franken gets approved for Minnesota, I think that will total 60.  That's what we need to get things done.    No more Repubican wrangling, making statements, pretending they care about the status of the American people  All they do is sing the same old song.."Tax cuts!"  Taxcuts for businesses with few customers. Taxcuts for the Unemployed.  Are they nuts?     How do Republicans think they can pay off the tremendous deficit they ran up?  How do they think they can repay China the billions they have borrowed?  Do they think tax cuts will do it?  Do they plan on tossing a few peanuts to cover that huge bill?    At the moment, we need jobs so that we can pay our taxes, spend some money, pay off credit cards, and get this country moving once again.     So, I am wildly happy about Judd Gregg becoming Secretary of Commerce.

I'm not sure what a secretary of commerce does, but I doubt that he would have any say so as to whether or not to attack another nation. I think our best interest now is to get ourselves together before we can be able to concentrate on other countries interest. Not to bully or disrespect others, but get our economy together before we start any other crusades. Give him time.

	There are three types of criminal - MAD, SAD and BAD.    People who need to be in gangs are not ballsy enough to be a bully on their own - they need to operate in a 'gang' it gives them a sense of belonging - hence the colours or the tattoos, or sweet embroidered jackets. Some are creeps some are sociopaths and some are just very lost and weak and need to belong.    Most have come from horrid homes and lack any social skills and violence is the only way they feel they have any control, bullying others - makes them feel "tougher". It is a very ugly and hard life.    Most gang members will roll over - if they can get away. Most will hang on to their Oath of "Honour" but if you can separate them from their group - you can determine if they are MAD, BAD or SAD and go from there.    Good luck|`|IUXriZQJaa	Yes and no.    As someone said here, most of them are just putting up a front.  It is the serious ones you have to watch out for. They are usually quiet and subtle but will kill you in half a heartbeat.    Any time you have someone who is ready, willing, able and quick to use deadly force against another person, it is unsettling to say the least.    Most of them, fortunately, are cowards and can be dealt with just by keeping a cool head. most of them don't know how to handle that.|`|gE03TUtQaa	Especially at White House level.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	No, most are tough in front of their friends.

a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	You have a good question, but you also need to define faith a bit more. If what you mean by faith is faith in the basic American way it's one thing, but by faith you mean going to church, etc. that's another.  I think by posting here, blogs, your own site, writing to newspapers and television stations and networks might be a good start, but keep in mind the naysayers have a huge head start on you.  So many people have lost faith simply because they're bombarded with negative news and ideas. They perceive all politicians as corrupted whether they are or not and they perceive all people with money as being selfish, greedy bastards. Some view anyone in need as simply lazy. Few are ever fair in their judgments.  Who's to say they're wrong? Who's to say they're right?

Sarah Palin was McCain's biggest mistake.  She is dynamic not enough to hid the fact that there was little or no substance.  The fact that McCain would pick someone with such little experience to be a heartbeat away from the presidency lost my support.  And to social moderates like myself didn't like her far right stand on social issues.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	The republicans lost because they did not promise everything under the sun to get votes.

Ordered compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.   ? Confined interrogation techniques to those in the Army Field Manual   ? Ordered a review of auto emissions standards.   ? Met with GOP leaders of both Houses of Congress to improve the stimulus package.  ? Did an interview with Al Arabiya TV, improving our reputation in the Arab/Muslim world.  ? Talked to every leader in the Middle East.   ? Named George Mitchell special envoy to the Middle East. Mitchell is already on the scene.  ? Got most of his cabinet confirmed.   ? Made family planning advice more available to women in Africa.  ? Met with top business leaders, who endorsed his plan.  ? Geithner put limits on lobbying from bank who receive TARP money (something Paulson could have easily done.)  ? Signed equal pay legislation  ? Condemned Wall Street bonuses  ?

And we haven't told them what to do.  In addition, they will be taxable for the income.

IUXriZQJaa	You are right, the same people who got us into the mess are running the show.
DY9NOh4taa	Obama has no idea of what he is doing, I would imagine that those companies that received bailout money were either supporters of Obama or members of the House or Senate, who received donations from those companies.   People seem to think that Former President Bush is the blame for the state of the economy and the lose of jobs in the US, even those who jumped the border are now started to return to their homes because of no jobs.  Bill Clinton was the architect, who are the urging of Jimmy Carter signed the NAFTA, which sent jobs south of the border and to Asia, where labor costs are minuscule amounts of money for the jobs that they perform often 10-20 cents, compared to 12-15 dollars in the United States.  Clinton also granted MFN status to China, after espionage agents from China, stole billions of dollars in technology from Silicone Valley, were merely deemed persona non grata and given days to leave the country, with absolutely no punishment whatsoever.  Clinton also caused the current housing mess, by guaranteeing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that the US Government would protect the loans that they were granting to people who had been unable to buy houses through normal channels, when balloon payments came due, the people had no money to pay them, which left Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae scrambling for help from the government.  Also if Bill Clinton would have taken one of two opportunities to assassinate Osama Bin Laden, instead of messing around in the Oval Office with an Intern and a cigar, it is entirely possible that 9/11/2001 would have never happended.  Clinton also allowed possible terrorists to stay in the United States under Clinton's Immigration Reform, which guarenteed that for $130 dollars, they would be granted asylym, all they had to do was renounce citizenship of the home country.  I say all that to say that some members of Obama's Cabinet are Clinton retreads that, were brought in to help Obama because of his inexperience.   Obama was only a "JUNIOR" Senator from Illinois from 2005, until his run for POTUS in 2008, and in time the strain will show, as he becomes overwhelmed with the duties and responsibilities of POTUS.  The sad thing is that as much as you try to tell people that Barack Obama has no business in the Oval Office, that being POTUS is not an on the job training position, peoples lives are in the balance and the security of the country is in the hands of an amatur, with only 3 1/2 years experience as a "Junior" Senator.|`|0h0uU1l4aa	LOl the guy who named all he has done.

Ordered a pay freeze of his top staff.   ? Ordered stricter controls on lobbyists in government.  ? Ordered compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.   ? Confined interrogation techniques to those in the Army Field Manual   ? Ordered a review of auto emissions standards.   ? Met with GOP leaders of both Houses of Congress to improve the stimulus package.  ? Did an interview with Al Arabiya TV, improving our reputation in the Arab/Muslim world.  ? Talked to every leader in the Middle East.   ? Named George Mitchell special envoy to the Middle East. Mitchell is already on the scene.  ? Got most of his cabinet confirmed.   ? Made family planning advice more available to women in Africa.  ? Met with top business leaders, who endorsed his plan.  ? Geithner put limits on lobbying from bank who receive TARP money (something Paulson could have easily done.)  ? Signed equal pay legislation  ? Condemned Wall Street bonuses  ? Ordered federal contractors to offer jobs to current workers when contracts change, and made it more difficult for federal contractors to discourage union activities.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	This looks more like a rant than a question.|`|gE03TUtQaa	Actually no we always pay the most crooked men in America to run our government.

RSlGKvFBaa	Its not a strategy excuse... its a fact that those police in the video arent "riot police" as they dont have full riot gear on.   They are controlling a moving demonstration, which is why they are going backwards in that way... they are not running away.  The public have a right to demonstate in this country. And any demonstration has to be evaluated by the police for its potential to flare up... and at the moment, Israel and Gaza is a very emotional and sensitive subject for many members of our society... the police have to take current events and public feeling into the equation when risk assessing how to police certain demonstrations as how the police react can have ramifications for the rest of the country.... if this demonstration erupting into violent fury.... then it could reoccur at any point in any part of our country.    Also...  look at the numbers.  There are many more demomstrators than police.. it literally is the thin blue line at the sharp end.  Sometimes police officers have to make dynamic risk assessments and, you say there is "wilful damage and assault".  I saw no damage take place, but a few items thrown at police.  Whilst this is disgraceful behaviour on part of the demonstrators, as a police officer you have to think "if i go in heavy handed and try to arrest is it going to inflame the situation even more and risk more disorder?"  Sometimes you have to use common sense in order to contain a potential dangerous situation.      Also the police are damned if they do and damned if they dont.  I am certain that if full riot police had turned out and gone in heavy handed, people would be posting questions on here about police brutality!    The police would have had their own evidence gatherers anyway, and be filming the demonstators themselves....  so the ones who were way out of line would be identified and arrested at a later date when it is much safer to do so.    If you ask me, it isnt the police who are humiliated in this video... it is the disgraceful behaviour and language of the demonstrators.  They are the ones who should hang their heads in shame.|`|n102y2SMaa	god|`|cfvAJJqdaa	I don't even understand what's going on and after 2 solid minutes of confusion (out of 9)  I put it off.

The police shown are not riot police. They are regular bobbies who will have been there to line the route of a peaceful protest march.

Riot police have full body armour and shields and would have been better prepared to face this sort of attack.

b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	One of the main purposes of Marine Boot camp is to put people in tough situations in order for them to develop mental fortitude. Americans are also a little hard headed and like to think we dont have to follow the rules, and so they have to change that at boot camp. They wont let you piss without permission.   The British dont really need that, they are raised to be a good deal more civil than other countries and so they take an entirely different approach to training. They arent going to be rebelling and trying to do things their own way all the time.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Uh, help us out here. What *are* the differences?|`|ffUCyXlmaa	u.s marines like to test their mental abilityby shouting at them until breaking point to see if they can take the pressure (thats what i believe anyway) where as british marines get motivated to push yourself beyond your limit but then when they do get shouted at they get ''shouted at''
glt02wg2aa	Who's the new moderate leader?!?  If you are talking about Michael Steele - where do you get your information?    Even the Leftist slanted Whakopedia shows Steele to be a fiscal conservative:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._...  One example: Quote  "The budget deficit: "Congress must also enact pro-growth policies that encourage the economy to expand: like making tax relief permanent and repealing the death tax. As we saw with the most recent deficit figures, a growing economy will in fact reduce the size of the budget deficit. In order to achieve optimal economic growth, Congress must adhere to sane spending guidelines while promoting smart policies devoted to growing businesses and creating jobs."|`|Hxttt7G0aa	They could do without the fascist huckabite types.

They state they are for the advancement of hispanics regardless of their immigration status.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	DOCAR is correct.  They formed in Southern Calfornia, and got legs at the University of California, Riverside.  That is where those famous words were uttered... we get with them, or we will be killed.    Calling it a weird accumulation of ideas is also correct.  Keep in mind that the Mestizo is the primary citizen in Meixco.  The first settlers.. the Indians, are seriously dissed by the rest of Mexico.  There is little or no respect and while they live on their reservations, they pay the price of being so disliked in their own society.  La Raza means, "The People" and while that sounds racist, it is racist.  But the Indians.. the first settlers, also called themselves.. but not other tribes.. the People.  Futher, any one tribe in Mexico does not necessarly like the other tribes.  It is complex and I believe the racism of La Raza comes from the complexity of that society in Mexico.|`|AA12365543	It is more like KKK and Nation of Islam combined.  They have a weird mythology about the Natives of Mexico and the northwest.  For instance, they hate pure natives, they see mestizos as holding the mantle and Natives as having lost it.  They believe only mestizos who are of mixed White and Aztec origin can live in Mexico and the American Southwest.    Just some weird cult political group.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Jose Angel Gutierrez, founder of la raza, stated: We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.  This is typical la raza cr@p! It is full of getting rid of anyone who is not hispanic and taking over the Americas.   How killing off another race and taking over isn't racist what is?|`|tOBUxfYvaa	Yes, la raza is a very racist group. They hate anyone who isn't hispanic and want everything for their people only.|`|AgxtBVwoaa	Worse, La Raza wants to reconquer the American southwest.
B1VxBl2paa	I think it's ridiculous democrats treat Obama like he's the Pope or Jesus Christ and that he's infallible and can do no wrong.    He's spending a trillion in tax dollars his first month with 47 left to go, completely ignoring a national disaster which is causing people to freeze to death while he enjoys 100 dollar steaks and plans his superbowl party.

Its also right that conservatives do to, But the most interesting thing is, conservatives have history and facts on their side. They don't have the weight of corrupt politics like the Clintons played, or the arrogance of many other people we can so easily point to and disgrace liberalism. Say the George Soros and how he played people on 911 in the markets, or the self righteous Jack Mertha's that call our troops murderers, or the idiots like Harry Reid who continously put their foots in their mouths with wrong information.  And yet the liberal won' t admit they are wrong, no matter how much history has shown it. No matter how much money they they have wasted like the War on Poverty ........Conservatism has many times saved American economics, and liberals have a reputation of takin advantage of America and ruining its foundings.|`|Uo5wYDklaa	my favorite thing is that liberals will often say that they believe all humans have rights rights, but then they turn around and say that killing an unborn child is okay.     My question to them is, "if a unborn baby doesn't have rights to life, when does it?"    on a side note, this is actually a topic that congress is starting to address. Some claim it is a way to get around the pro-choice, but really i think it is key. When does life start and thus rights start and why aren't liberals all over this giving their insight?|`|BHeBSGemaa	Thanks for telling me what I love to do.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	They do it from the safety of their computer keyboards but I have never met a Lib that was ballsy enough to get in my face in person.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	It is not I tell you.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Just like the conservatives.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	We tolerate *you*...

Originally it was written with a foreword by Orwell, stating that the only difference between the East and West of the time was that the West's censorship was passive (and so, more effective). Ironically this foreword was censored in all Western countries.    EDIT: Come to think of it, it might've been a foreword in 1984. Oh well, I know that the Ministry of Truth is a parody of the Ministry of Information, the organisation that censored the foreword in Britain.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Its the weekend!

AA11995584	You will get many replies that question you. I do not believe an A+ is in order, a B is a bit more realistic. He did preside over the best economy in recent memory {with a democrat congress in 2006 came recession} I think he made some poor choices in 2008 to appease the Democrats  1 B-  2 A+  3 C : here is where it gets tricky. Rumsfield had a plan to go with a scaled back military. Many in the higher ranks bucked this plan, so the Generals on the ground did not buy into the philosophy of the department.( Kinda like Doolittle getting demoted for his insistence on a strong Air Force) Iraq was a beaming success right up to the point we disbanded their army, then all hell broke loose. The surge worked the only problem is the surge was 3 years later than it needed to be.  4 A+ post (9/11)  5 A+  6 C he really did not go over the top to make emmision standards tougher  7 C he did help the poor by insisting on education standards. He would have better helped them with a solid work for welfare program and if Vouchers would have been front and center.  8 A+ his Administration is more racially diverse than Obamas  9 B+ Bush at times did not exude the qualities we expect in our President. I do think he had a high regard for the office and did everything he believed was right for our country.  10 D- sorry to say he did nothing to stem the "we want universal health care" bunch. Sweeping changes in managed care and prescription pricing would have gone a long way to this I am not in favor of the so called Universal health care, but Bush did little to stream line health care cost.|`|0Z7sxpbcaa	i agree 100% with all you said  but it doesnt matter now because obama is going to destroy it all  and we have to suffer now by giving our hard earned $$$ to people who are too darn lazy to get a job    "spread the wealth'    what an idiot he is!~|`|rX8MkfBJaa	The answers here are a prime example of the brainwashed and uninformed.

A man who served in his county caucus, congressional convention and state convention for the party. I voted for Bush... and now see it as a huge blunder!  1) The Economy: George Bush grew the size and budget of the federal government more than ANY president other than LBJ. And he only loses that distinction to LBJ if it is factored as a percentage of GNP. Otherwise, he's the MOST fiscally irresponsible President in our history. This coupled with terrible monetary policies by the Federal Reserve have brought us to the brink of economic chaos.  Grade: F  2) The Military: I'm not sure what this generic term is meant to be graded upon. Since you set a separate line for his undeclared wars, I guess you mean in general, was he good for our military? No. He has subjected our military to rigors of undeclared war and thus broken his pledge to obey, protect and defend the Constitution. He is a law breaker.   Grade:F  3) Irag and Afghanistan: See above... I could support an offensive campaign in Afghanistan for obvious reasons. But his strategy was to bring a western style democracy to an Islamic state. As Macedonians, British and Soviets all eventually learned, Afghanistan is a nation that is easy to invade and punish, but not control. He learned NOTHING from history! Iraq was absolutely fool hearty from the get-go. The war was justified under false pretense, thus making it an unjust war. How can you as a Christian support such a thing.  Grade:F -  4) Keeping us safe from harm and evil: Well considering the fact that the principle motivation for 9-11 was our military presences on the Arabian peninsula, he has only stiffened the resolve of those who attacked us. He claimed the attack was motivated by their hatred of our culture and 'freedom'... that is non-sense! He is either a liar or is clueless.  Grade: F  This is really getting absurd. These categories can't be weighted equal anyway. His overall grade is a very unimpressive F!|`|TKbYavhzaa	1) D  (self-evident)  2) B (mostly good, but failure on cluster bomb and landmine bans)  3) D (a C for Afghanistan and an F for Iraq)  4) C (some good stuff, some bad stuff like not securing the ports)  5) D (tax relief mainly for the rich)  6) F (complete failure on environmental issues, gutting EPA, etc)  7) D (reduction in college scholarships, opposition to minimum wage increases).  8) C (can't think of anything he did)  9) F (poor demeanor, excessive vacationing)  10) D (medicare part D was kind of a mess, nothing else proactive)    Overall: D|`|4zijn0cgaa	D- for the economy.

A narrow mind is an ignorant mind. We are divided by the loving intelligent people & the ones who will understand others. We have always had people who did not understand English but many people now create businesses to appeal to people who speak different languages. I know a republican who always put down Spanish speaking people. His daughter was in my son's class & they saw how my son was able to use the spanish he learned to speak in his career so their daughter brushed up on her Spanish is now teaching Spanish classes & taken contracts that are in English & putting them into Spanish. So being open minded has helped her with a career. If you think that you can protect yourself from not learning a new language this is a waste of energy. English people will not have to learn Spanish so why worry about all of this. Why does it matter if some people another language. Men are from mars & women from Venus are we going to all speak male or female language. Somethings are just not worth fighting with & reps. seem to always want to struggle instead of enjoying the beauty of life. Reps always think the dems are immoral & they are really missing out on reality. We just accept our life & know we experience different things. Ted Haggart is going around telling people how he was speaking with the white house everyday when Bush was in office. If he was a dem this would be scandalous. Obama tried to heal the country (heal is like a cut finger coming together) reps. are too past thinking & have no clue about how to have peace or how to be one with others. Everything is a war, fight, struggle, competition. It really is up to the reps. to change. The dems are always open to welcome them but reps. won't find out the truth they are brainwashed by people who are paid by greedy rich who want us all dependent on them for medical care, jobs, etc. Yes, we can be diverse but one.

Makes me proud to the cockles of my heart      Wasn't this country better when we were all AMERICANS working toward making this a great country! - It sure was.      Good question and thank you for it.    Did you see this because I think it speaks to what you are asking?    A Modest Proposal (for a divorce)      Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2009 15:40:08 +0000     Proposal Below:      Dear  American  liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists, Obama supporters, et al:     We have stuck together since the late 1950's, but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has run its course.      Our two ideological sides of America cannot, and will not ever agree on what is right, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile, chalk it up to irreconcilable differences, and go our own way.     Here is a model dissolution agreement: Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that it should be relatively easy!      Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes. We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them. You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU.    Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA, and the military.     You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell (You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move them).     We'll keep the capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street. You can have your beloved homeless, homeboys, hippies, and illegal aliens. We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's, and rednecks.     We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood .     You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.     You can have the peaceniks and war protestors. When our allies or way of life are under assault, we'll provide them job security. We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values..     You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N. But we will no longer be paying the bill. We'll keep the SUVs, pickup trucks, and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Subaru station wagon you can find. You can give everyone healthcare, if you can find any practicing doctors.     We'll continue to believe healthcare is earned and not a right. We'll keep The Battle Hymn of the Republic and the National Anthem.  I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute Imagine, I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing, Kum Ba Ya, or We Are the World.     We'll practice trickle down economics, and you can give trickle up poverty its best shot. Since it often so offends you we'll keep our history, our name, and our flag.     Would you agree to this? If so please pass it along to other like minded patriots, and if you do not agree, just hit delete and hang on. In the spirit of friendly parting, I'll bet you ANWAR on who will need whose help in 15 years.        Sincerely,   Joe Six-pack   American Worker/Patriot       P.S.  Also, we'll throw in Barbra Streisand and Jane Fonda.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	Well it is a whole lot easier to get a taco or burrito now.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	OMG!!

It started going downhill from Roe vs Wade and the activism of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.  Google her name and see all the damage she has done.   Commies got a foothold in this Country and vandalized our school system from Pre-K to University.  People stopped having respect for themselves and started believing Darwinism.  They even started acting like the animals they believe they came from.  Drugs became more rampant and with it crime.  What can we who are considered "old school" do or expect?  Our voices are dwindling and their voices are getting stronger.  Common sense has died.  Here is the OBITUARY.    Obituary of the late Mr. Common Sense.        Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend,      Common Sense, who has been with us for many years,      No one knows for sure how old he was, since his birth      records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape.      He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable      lesson as:        Knowing when to come in out of the rain;      Why the early bird gets the worm;      Life isn't always fair;      and maybe it was my fault.        Common Sense lived by simple sound financial policies      (don't spend more than you can earn) and reliable      strategies (adult, not children,are in charge).        His health began to deteriorate rapidly when      well-intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place.      Reports of a 6-year -old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing  a     classmate;  suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch;      and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student,      only worsened his condition.        Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the  job  that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly  children.      It declined even further when schools were required to get parental  consent  to administer Calpo,sun lotion or a band aid to a student; but could not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted an abortion.        Common Sense lost the will to live as the ten Commandments became contraband;  churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims.        Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you for assault.        Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to realize that a  steaming cup of coffee was hot.       She spilled a little in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge      settlement.        Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents,      Truth and Trust; his wife, Discretion; his daughter      Responsibility; and his son, Reason.        He is survived by his 3 stepbrothers;      I know my rights, Someone else is to Blame, and I'm a Victim.        Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.        If you still remember him, pass this on.      If not, join the majority and do nothing.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	I pretty much agree with you on this 100%|`|axHyoVqGaa	I have been saying this forever.  Despite the claims of the pc crowd, differences have never served to unite people and this is exactly why we have such a divide in America today.  If we can wake up to this in time, we may be able to fix the problem and avoid another civil war or possible future revolts.  However, I honestly believe that we have passed the point of no return.  The sad thing is that we could have never reached this point, if it wasn't for people taking what we have for granted.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Your points are very good. America will continue to be great if we can all put aside our differences, especially the multi-cultural crap, and focus instead on our shared values. "Diversity is our strength" is a ridiculous saying. Diversity means different. It adds color and flavor to our society, but it certainly doesn't give it strength. What gives it strength is when people are more concerned about their fellow Americans, regardless if race or ethnicity or religious views, than they are wrapped up in their irrelevant ethnicity. It's strong when we all realize that we share a lot of  hopes, dreams, and desires. If we continue along the multi-cultural lines, placing more importance on race and ethnicity than on the common good of our nation, we will cease to be a nation.|`|AA12212403	I don't think such marked diversity is good, but some is good.  Though, sometimes I just wish that all the liberals would go to one side of the country and all the conservatives would go to the other and we could all be part of this country but govern separately.  I'm awfully sick of the bickering.    One person said this:    "And to the anti welfare people.  How much does a welfare recipient steal from you?  Oh the life of leisure. Almost starving but kept barely alive to watch you buy new vehicles and homes"    I think the welfare recipient has probably, in a lifetime of working, stolen about 100K or more from me, personally.   We are not rich folks, we don't drive around in Ferari's, we drive Subarus with payments.  We owe lots of money on our house and we live paycheck to paycheck.  I doubt you are almost starving and kept barely alive, by the way.  Here you are on yahoo, so you obviously own a computer and can afford that, or do you choose that instead of food?  May I remind you that in this country, at least now, you have just as much of a chance as I do to do something with yourself and make a real living.  I have heard of many millionaires who started out with virtually nothing.  You have to have the drive and determination.  Right now, you truly could do something for yourself.  A year or two from now, maybe you'd have to be taxed so much that you wouldn't be able to get a business effort going, sadly.  I don't mind paying taxes when I see it goes to the common good, but to allow lazy do-nothings to sit around and, even worse, collect unemployment and work under the table is bothersome to me.  I don't mind paying for government, services like fire/police, schools, unemployment for short term folks who are truly looking for jobs, welfare for those truly disabled or truly unable to work, etc.  But, there are "cheaters" out there and they ruin it for everyone else.  I do also agree that immorality is so sad.  Sleazy is the word I might use.  Just turn on your TV and you see blatent things that have to be "naughty" in order to be funny nowadays, no more good clean entertainment or even commercials.  It's a sick society and like the Roman Empire fell... we may find outselves do the same unless we clean up our act.  Sad, but true.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	the liberals have been trying to divide the country for a long time...i guess it finally paid off for them.|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	"(not immortality running rampant)" I agree, vampires are a threat to the nation.

Become and American or get the he11 out.    So i guess thew answer to your question is that it is not good to be diverse because all it really does is divide out country into small groups.|`|b1175d4d889f29087cceea9d76b4eccfaa	United States NEVER had ONLY Americans.   It is the most international country in the world, everyone from the whole world comes to the US, and the only "true" Americans were the Native Americans that your ancestors killed and exploited.     English IS the common language..is it bad if a lot of people speak more than just English??    A diverse America is the ONLY America. I cannot imagine an America where EVERYONE has the SAME morals, the SAME goals, and the SAME things to be proud of.     I don't know if you realize it, but without foreigners and even illegal immigrants, your country would be in an AWFUL state. Illegal immigrants do SO much work that real "Americans" don't want to do.   Immigrants from India, China, and Russia are the smartest people in the entire world who do work Americans are intellectually incapable of doing and help the US economy tremendously by doing so.     It doesn't matter if diversity is "good" or bad for America (it's good), the point is, diversity IS America and I hope that one day you will realize how lucky you are to be living it such a unique country.|`|09neUq82aa	What is the national goal of America?    This is where I think we truly disagree. I don't think America has any goals. I don't think it should. Way I see it is that countries are just there for people to live and feel safe in. We shouldn't be looking to conquer lebensraum or anything, we should just be defending our interests.    I also don't believe in common morality, or common anything for that matter. We are all individuals. You can't just say to some guy who, due to a strong Christian faith, opposes the military "Sorry, you aren't American, go away." You can't just say to some guy who happens to be a Hindu "Sorry, your customs aren't the same as the majority's, leave."    If I see a Hindu, I don't think "hey, a Hindu," I think "hey, some guy." I can be friends with "some guy." I can get to know "some guy's" sister.     This is what being human is to me. I'm not out to join a big powerful movement surging in some direction. I'm not out to further the interests of the Volk, or the flag, or the working classes, or whatever.    I'm just living, and being as nice to everyone as I can be.|`|AA11942215	OK... let's take a look at the big picture.      1. Common language (English)  As an English and ESL teacher I can assure you that one of the goals in schools is to teach *all* students how to speak and write in English.  It's not easy.  It takes at least 5 to 7 years to become "FEP" (Fluent English Proficient).  However, current politics take away many programs designed to teach English to foreign language speakers.  A few years ago California passed a law giving students in effect *one year* to learn English.  Do you think you could go to China and learn the language in one year?  These types of "solutions" exacerbate rather than mitigate the problem.  Do I think English should become the "official" national language.  No.  It is already the unofficial language of our country, and politicizing the language debate simply leads to uninformed decision making rather than problem solving.    2. Common morality (not immortality running rampant)  Yeah... LOL at the typo!  Anyhow... which "common morality" do you propose?  That of Southern Baptists?  Islamic Revolutionaries?  Berkeley Hippies?  Morality has always translated into laws, many of which are antiquated.  Do I want others telling me what is right and wrong and I'll go to jail if I don't fit their version of morality?  To an extent I already do.  This quest for common morality is too vague.  Do I think that we should all work towards a common good and help our fellow humans?  Yup!  Let's start by having the bailout CEOs return the $36 billion in bonuses they collected last year!    3. Common goals for our nation  Again... which common goals do you want?  Right now we exploit workers around the world to bring cheap goods to Walmart at the expense of our own workers who require higher wages.  Common goals?  How about moving away from a "me first, buy me stuff consumerist nation" to one of a public service oriented one?      4. Pride in our military and defense  We're the biggest baddest mutha on the block.  We're the most elite fighting force in the history of the world.  We're the lone remaining world superpower.  Is that what you mean by pride?  On the flip side, we spent the Soviet Union into the ground with military spending.  Their GNP couldn't handle it.  How much longer do you think we'll be able to afford ours?  Has Iraq taught us anything that military solutions to world problems sometimes backfires? What other options do we have other than military for foreign policy decisions?    5. Everyone pays taxes because we're all in this together  Shall we start at the top or do you want to tax the welfare moms while we're here?    It's easy to speak in platitudes and generalities on both sides of these issues. I'd like to think that we can be the greatest country in the world through diversity, and don't feel threatened by those who think (or speak) differently than myself.  I believe in honoring and respecting those who think in a different way, as long as they don't spout hatred or call for the death of those who think differently.  Unfortunately there are too many out there like that!|`|5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	Diversity, in my own humble opinion, will always create an environment that will promote new ways of thinking and innovation.  It does not promote cohesiveness, particularly with close-minded or under-educated people.  The debate would tend to rely on how much  the diversity is applicable to effectiveness and how much equivalence can be attained from the diversity.    In  America,  the basis of a uniform language, would be most effective for communication amongst the populous. ( In pure number the top 3 would be:  1-Chinese, 2-Spanish, 3-English. If you count the number of countries that speak the language, however, it would be: 1-English, 2-French, 3-Arabic.)  Whatever the primary language, children who are taught to be bi or multilingual have been shown to have greater levels of problem solving and a greater acceptance of diversity.  Comprender?  Comprendre?  LOL?    In America, the basis of the common morality is through our laws.  It is not aways a true reflection of the common morality as many laws are passed without a vote of the populous, but it is representative, of those elected to represent the populous.  It is certainly not perfect due to the inequity of legal representation, or of those who cannot afford litigation.  Most corporations tend to retain attorneys, that private parties cannot afford, which does lead to inequity.  Regardless of inequity, in many ways our system of justice is still, of the best, in the world.    In America, much of our goals are common.  Yet to find an answer to achieve them is difficult.  Our representative system must hold those offices to a greater responsibility than ever before.  We have seen many cases where those in government  have abused the powers of their office and are not justly punished.  White collar crimes should be treated in equal severity with other crimes, as the livelihood of many more, that are less represented can be effected.    In America, I believe that nearly everyone is proud of our troops and the job that they are required to do.  The policies and decisions of the administrations should be held highly accountable.  It should not be the responsibility of the US to be world police.  We need to concentrate on our internal security before attempting to secure that of the world.  Nearly 50% of your tax dollar goes into the military machine.  Is that the allotment which your own values and ideals would proportion?  Seems that Education, Health, and the stabilization of our own economy might be higher in proportion?    In America,  nearly everyone does pay tax.  The amount of tax is apportioned by income.  The higher your income, the higher the percentage of tax is paid. A flat tax has been suggested among many constituents, which could amount to a budget surplus and do away with the IRS, but most corporations will find more tax loopholes, and make more money with the present system, so they will levy to not allow that measure to pass.    In America, I think that there are a lot fewer people that really have a clue, than those that think they do.  If the choices were truly that obvious, or the path that we should choose, so well defined, we would all still have seperate ideas.  We are diverse, and it would be wisest to accept it, and not concentrate on the differences first.  The  build  on a foundation of the commonality that our founding fathers of this nation brought forth on this nation.  ONE of representation, and freedom, with respect for ALL.|`|x12mMdApaa	if you want a liberal answer RACIEST RACIEST RACIEST  if you want a conservative answer you are correct we are destined to fall.|`|IUXriZQJaa	In little things like Kalachis, Baklava, Curried goat, Escovitch fish, Kung Pao Chicken, Stroganoff, Fajitas, Tamales, Flan, Sio-pao, Hummus, Kielbasa, Bratwurst, Akarra, Jalaf rice, sushi, Terriyaki, Pizza, Lasagne, Chicken Cordon Bleu, . . . folk dance, "weird" traditions, different music, different clothing styles, different names, etc, we need diversity. In the business arena, the best of each culture is needed as a business asset.    From a Church point of view, every nation, tribe and tongue needs Jesus, so bring them on...    I don't think that's what you were objecting to.    "1. Common language (English)"    Absolutely! Let people speak other languages at home or in their little Kaffeeklatches, but our language of trade and industry needs to bind us together, not tear us apart. Companies have to spend more money and increase their prices to absorb that cost when bands of people who speak a different language use that language barrier to protect their laziness and complacency. Why do we print ballots in other languages? and WHY the  @$%& do I have to dial 1 for English?!?!?!    "2. Common morality (not immortality running rampant)"    This used to be codified into law and is the prerogative and moral imperative of each state. All laws are based upon morality. It is immoral to murder, but immoral people murder. It is immoral to cheat on schoolwork, but kids do it all the time.  The problem is that they get practiced in one form of immorality and it is much easier to move on to another. Psychologists and schoolteachers are even being trained to teach children to accept and embrace moral failure as a way of life.    Look at the results; Broken families, people forced into single-parent situations, where life is far more difficult and more expensive, people CHOOSING single-parent families rather than living with the other half of the parental equation, kids growing up in broken homes and turning to gangs, crime and other moral failure for a sense of familial love and acceptance . . .     "3. Common goals for our nation"    That died when they blasted McCarthy out of office. He was right. Look at his list and look at how things have panned out. Without exception, he was right.    "4. Pride in our military and defense"    Cronkite, Rather, Chung, Murdoch, Trump, Gore, Kerry, the Kennedies  and like-minded people have done their level best to destroy that. It used to be that it was not safe to desecrate a flag where others could see you, because someone would rightly beat the snot out of you for it. It used to be that people treated soldiers with respect.    Now colleges and universities have the unmitigated audacity to ban our heroes in uniform from entering their campuses to recruit new heroes.    "5. Everyone pays taxes because we're all in this together"     This has never really happened and never really will. Thieves will always find a way to steal, and that is what cheating on your taxes is. This goes back to a common morality.    Here is how you should look at your decision-making process;     If everyone lived by the same standards I do, would this country be a fit place to live?    Why do the same people who complain about racism call for affirmative action hiring quotas?    Why do the same people who claim to represent the farmers pass laws which favor only big corporate farms and then blame the other side for the failure of the family farms?    Why do the same people who created this financial mess continue to increase in power and blame the crises they created on others while exasperating the situation with "bailouts" to keep the cash flowing to their patrons?    If everyone lived by that standard, where would we be?|`|TKbYavhzaa	You sound like Obama...|`|MEReSvZeaa	I think you're talking way over the heads of some posters here.

Shallow nitwits! Phonies!|`|KXCgvxpPaa	fat *** Oprah needs to shut her f'in mouth up.

It is odd that they jump all over this with great enthusiasm, while giving the finger to Bush Sr. when he talked about volunteerism. Remember the million lights on top of the hill comment?

Since to you the Hungry are just lazy and Kids with Autism are just brats and the only way to solve economic problems is to give the richest Americans tax cuts (been there done that)  and the only way to deal with our enemies is to start wars. living green makes you evil or something.      it's clear that this video would confuse you because you don't see the world how Democrats do.      so what's your pledge ?      do you pledge to be hateful of this President because he might be successful in fixing the mess Bush made?|`|6j8d7TZTaa	ogreat1 is right and why don't you get use to the idea of him being pres now. is it because nobody makes videos about you or what.

The birth certificate must be legible, you will need to get in contact with your state department of records about getting another one.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	You can print out an application online, but i believe they do have copies at the post office    You need a passport to travel OUTSIDE the country, you do NOT need one to trvale within the US    Yes they can take your picture    As for staying in other countries, you have to get visas to visit other countires, UNLESS they take part in the Visa Waiver program. You would have to go online and check that countries government site to read about foreign visitor requirements    What words are unclear?|`|47xvK2Zhaa	1. Do the post offices have applications on site, or do I need to get one before I go there?     A; YES THEY HAVE  all what you need in there in the post office    2. Does a U.S. passport allow me to travel outside of the country or only in the U.S.? If the details about the post office say "photo on site", does that mean that they can take my picture there?   A; Yes they will take a picture for you.    3. How long can I stay in another country with a passport?   A; 90 DAYS UP TO 6 months depending of the country     4. I have my original birth certificate, but some of the words are unclear because of age and wear. Do I need to ask the state for a copy?   you must get a new copy.    The passport is only to trael outside of your country USA.   as an American citizen you are allowed to travel all over USA with out a passport,you do not need your birth certificate all what you need is your ID or Driving lic.

However, I don't think there are enough Jews to be able to do that. They are widespread, therefore thin numbers in many countries. Have you considered that you may be thinking of the Jews following in the Nazi' footsteps. I really don't believe that they would dishonour their fallen dead to do something like that.
cdpBdzZtaa	First of all you got visitor/Business visa believing you have no intention of immigrating to USA,Since you are changing your status from non-immigrant to immigrant.You can't leave while I-130 pending,you need number 7 in your list i.e     7. Request for Travel Documents (Optional) (USCIS Form I-131) which goes by other name Advance Parole, will be issued after submitting adjustment of status(I-485).Once you have Advance parole you are free to travel.    I read some other forums,you need to go to CBP and get date corrected on I-94     P.S:I'm no expert ,research further and decide carefully|`|T8nap2Pnaa	well, you're here now and in the process of filing all the forms. If you leave, your chances of getting back in on the tourist visa are very low. and you don't want to lie about your marriage and petition, or not only will you be denied entry, you could very easily be made permanently ineligible for any visa, including immigrant visas for misrepresentation and fraud.     Now, once you've filed all the necessary forms and you want to travel outside of the US, you'll need to get advance parole before you leave. if you leave without it, you won't  be able to come back without an immigrant visa, and that is likely to be a year or more away.proof of simply filing the I-130 won't mean anything in getting back into the US. either you have advance parole and you get in, or you don't and you won't. find a nice place to go on honeymoon here in America for now.. otherwise, you risk a very real possibility that the two of you won't be living together in the US until sometime in 2010.

z42u6Tbkaa	Yes, I'm a Marine reservist and go to college too. You get the select reserve gi bill. The amount is based off credit load. I get about 875ish a month, I'm also a vet, I don't know if they factor that in too or not. Plus, you have to consider the new gi bill coming out in august.    Marine contracts are all 8 years. For active duty guys its 4 active 4 inactive. The reserves has 3x5, 4x4, and 6x2 which is the most common and gives the best benefits. I don't know what kind of crazy contract missy's bro has because I've never even heard of a 6 year reserve contract. Especially, one where you go active duty for the last two years. Anyway, take a look at a 6x2, you drill one weekend a month two weeks a year for 6 years. After that you're pretty much out, you don't drill, and they'd only call you up in case of some world war. The 3x5 and 4x4 work the same way just different amount of years spent actively drilling. If you want to know anything else about the reserves hit me up.    Heres a link with more info on the sr gi bill.http://www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/CH160...    The SR gi bill is the opposite of the gi bill, you can only use the sr gi bill while your actively drilling.|`|dSbAz63baa	The guy above basically is saying marines are stupid : ) Even though he has a point. Go marines, excel and become Force Recon. Dont settle for being basic in any branch.|`|AA11163314	They are not going to let you do this.

The American soldiers who have sacrificed their lives in Iraq, did in fact die in vain.    We invaded a sovereign nation for no reason, and we have killed thousands of innocent people.  As soon as we leave there will be a massive civil war.  In fact the events set in motion by George Bush will lead to thousands more deaths over the coming years.  Not to mention the fact we just about bankrupted our nation doing all of this.    While some families of the troops will try and take comfort from the fact that Iraq has been liberated, the sad reality is that Bush abused our troops and got them killed for no good reason.  It is a travesty.    Our troops signed up to defend our nation.  Not to act as the world police, rushing in to countries and imposing our western values on them.    The reason we have so many issues with terrorists is because we keep interfering with other countries, and in doing so we provide the propaganda necessary to recruit the next generation of terrorists.    We need to get our own house in order before we start trying to invade the rest of the world.|`|30c80fd1b17a3706bf5570a2557e2287aa	You thought wrong.

IUXriZQJaa	War is hell.     Nobody ever put it better than that.      A mid-80s song said it well; "Sweet dreams and fine machines in pieces on the ground."  It should only be engaged in when there are no other options.    The only way to prevent it is to be capable of wiping out the enemy and make that ability clear to all.    War means absence of human rights. Being at war means always watching for the enemy wherever you go, looking for saboteurs and snipers, planning your travel with them in mind, wondering if you will get across the street safely, ducking for cover every time you see an airplane flying low, finding terror in every loud noise --and this is just the scene outside of the hot zone.    In the soup, it is constant chaos with good men killing and dying, good machines destroying and being destroyed, and every sector of life dominated by a panic-level necessity to kill to avoid being killed and to destroy enemy assets to prevent them from being used against you. War means scorched earth and abandonment of all that is near and dear. War means lost sons and husbands, families wiped out or damaged beyond repair, homes destroyed, economic ruin, famine, total obliteration of infrastructure, the reduction of the finest city to a third (or fourth) world scene.  War means the expenditure of entire national treasuries on weapons, ammunition and vehicles to deliver them.    I don't see how anything could be worse on the face of the earth.|`|bc7ea663e5b190e96d0d2e3497e93e39aa	Depends which end of the war.

Bush, like his father and Ronhole Raygun, were spared impeachment for their outrageous crimes by do-nothing Congresses.    3. No presidents have been removed from office as a result of impeachment.  Tricky D!ck was removed by the threat of impeachment.    4. High crimes and misdemeanors include accepting bribes from corporate cronies and offering them outrageous tax breaks while refusing to regulate their criminal activities.  They also include overthrowing democratically elected administrations in other countries just because capitalist pigs object to who these countries elected.|`|AA11598520	1. Indictment for trial by the senate.     2. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton    3. I don't think either were found guilty.    4. Felonies, including lying under oath, murder, rape, assault, burglary, conspiracy to commit a crime, extortion.....just a few examples.    (The charges for Bill Clinton weren't BS. He was disbarred as a result of lying under oath.)|`|AA10465540	Basically, impeachment is an indictment against the president brought by the House of Representatives.  Andrew Johnson and William Clinton are the only two presidents ever to be impeached.  Neither was found guilty and both stayed in office.  High crimes and misdemeanors refers to crimes against the U.S. primarily.|`|DY9NOh4taa	Impeachment is a process that begins when there is evidence that the person being Impeached has committed an offense that calls for their removal of their office or employment.   Their is usually an Impeachment Committee that is formed and then the process of impeaching the individual begins.  There have only been two American Presidents that have been impeached the first was Andrew Johnson which occurred in 1868, but the impeachment committee could not get the two thirds majority needed to impeach him.  The second President to face impeachment was Bill Clinton in 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, and was exonerated in 2/1999 by the Senate.  Richard Nixon was the first President in history to resign from the POTUS, after impeachment proceedings had been initiated.   None of the three named above were actually removed from the office of POTUS, the closest being Nixon who resigned and named Gerald Ford his successor.  High crimes, are allegations of misconduct that do not fall under a more clearly defined impeachable offense; e.g., high treason. This charge occurs only in cases of parliamentary impeachment and is unrelated to any offense in criminal law.  Obama is already skating on thin ice, after the FBI released a tape recorded phone call between Barack Obama and then Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, in which they are discussing the price of the Senate seat that was vacated by Obama after his election to POTUS, in November.  There is little doubt that there will be investigations into Obama's participation in the scandal in which Rod Blagojevich was impeached by the Illinois Senate earlier in the week.
FFE9Qztzaa	You pretty much said them all..  But i'm not too sure on Obama though.|`|t82AcQT1aa	Their vice presidents seem to fall into the same category as well.
cRDbeUDvaa	He can say what he wants, including the 8 years of complaining he did about how unamerican liberals were for wanting Bush to fail.    This isn't a football match, where wanting the other team to fail makes some sense.  And it's not like failure of his policies to pass is a possibility worth discussing. Wanting Obama to fail is like wanting the plane you are on to crash because you don't like the pilot's union.|`|OYWKu6ouaa	Absolutely not!  Rush did not say that he wanted Obama to fail as a president, he said that he wanted his policies to fail.  Why would Rush wish Obama's policies well if he doesn't agree with them?  Also, there is thing called freedom of speech, and Rush was just using this constitutional right. The problem comes when Obama tells American citizens not to listen to Rush Limbaugh.  I do not like the government telling me what to do, and Obama does this by telling people to stop listening to Rush.|`|meVH73dOaa	I am not politically any thing, I do not judge a book by it's cover, and I do NOT think that Rush was out of line, I think the President was out of line , by attacking a private citizens. Rush silenced first and then us. Obama wants all silenced that do not agree with him. Dictator , that is what he wants to be, and stay in office even after all his term limits run out. Personally I hope he FAILS and with the looks of things and the way it is going, he has already pooped and will fall face first in his own pile.  No one has to refrain on here , every  one has a right to answer this question, and I know you will see , they will..  Ok!!! every one needs to start refraining from answering this question.|`|5syj6Uzaaa	Not identifying myself as a political conservative, I apologize for disregarding your request.  I have some words that I would like to add.  I apologize for what will also be a tangential answer but hope that my comments will be useful in the broader perspective of political "failure".    Rush is a blowhard, and I don't care what he meant or whether he is out of line.  However, the idea of political failure is interesting.  The automatic assumption of many people (you included, I think) appears to be that Obama's success is the general success of the nation.    I am careful to separate the interests of politicians from the disparate interests of every person in the nation.  Indeed, no two people are likely to have the same interests unless they have voluntarily agreed to do so [1].  Also, there is the matter of distinction between what a politician publicly claims as his goals and what might be his private goals.    In this context, I often hope for a politician to fail in his true internal goals because I believe that he is in opposition to my interests.  I want to succeed, and I want to see the politician brought down.  My personal success will be more likely if there is general prosperity, so I do identify broadly with the society in which I live.  I want the society of United States to be prosperous.    If our society does manage to be prosperous, we can be certain that politicians of all stripes will scurry to claim credit regardless of what real impact their policies had.  I am of the view that we prosper in spite of political institutions.  The best thing that we could do would be to disregard the politicians and go about life on our own and with the assistance of the voluntary associations that we choose.  We can do better without politicians.  In this way, it would be possible (likely, if I am right) for the broader society to flourish while the politicians fail in a very personal way.    I only know about Rush's comments from second hand sources.  If he meant that he hopes to see broad suffering that will repudiate Obama's policies, then I (as a non-conservative) think that he was out of line.  Rush is a parasite on the political establishment.  Not being a politician himself, he thrives on demagoguery regarding political issues.  If political conflict ever subsided, he could lose prestige and and influence.    Rush Limbaugh's interests, no more than politician interests, are not necessarily aligned with the rest of society no matter how eloquent (and yes, even right) he may be on some issues.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No. He said he hopes Obama's policies fail. I hope they do too. His policies will lead America towards European socialism.|`|MEReSvZeaa	I heard the show you're referring to, so I know exactly what he said, and I agree with him 100%.    Barak has promised some things that would be disastrous for America, and I want every single one of them to fail.    (I think it's funny that liberals are complaining about this, considering they never made the distinction with Bush.  They NEVER said they wanted Bush's "policies" to fail, they wanted BUSH to fail--and be arrested, and tried, and assassinated, and murdered by Cheney on a hunting trip, etc.  Liberals are just about the stupidest animals in the kingdom.)|`|c2hfVjxgaa	He hoped his POLICIES would fail.  I don't want liberal policies implemented that will move us more toward socialism so I hope they fail too.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Who the fk cares??    We have a first amendment...........he can say it if he wants!!!!    What he was implying was that he hopes socialism fails to get instituted.    And after listening to Pelosi talk about nationalizing the banks, I think he might be on to something:    http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/busine...    Well, whatever you want to call it, said Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California. If we are strengthening them, then the American people should get some of the upside of that strengthening. Some people call that nationalization.    Im not talking about total ownership, she quickly cautioned  stopping herself by posing a question: Would we have ever thought we would see the day when wed be using that terminology? Nationalization of the banks? |`|AA11313983	He's a political pundit with a show on talk radio.  That's what he does.      It was far more upsetting to me when Harry Reid, an elected official, said that I had lost the war in Iraq, and then voted to make me keep fighting it; and when Obama called my job a mistake.|`|4zijn0cgaa	No. Rush said if the president intends to bring bigger government and more government spending and more socialist ideas to America then He wants OZbama`s plans to fail.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	OK, mum's the word...|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	No.  He was talking about keeping America going down the socialist path.      Obama sure know how to light the fire of the grass roots base of the conservative movement,|`|Q9W7p6Kzaa	He did not go far enough.    Obama will destroy this nation if he succeeds with his left wing agenda.|`|8iAOasaxaa	This is all posturing and political grandstanding to bring talk radio into the media spotlight.

C'mon people.    Second Limbaugh's statements were and always will be taken completely out of context.  There's no denying he has a shock factor everytime he says something but that's just the way he does his thing.     He said he hopes Obama fails and went on to say that what he really means by it is that he hopes liberalism itself fails because that's what he believes the problem is.     Don't just react after you see some headline somewhere.  Be responsible and research a little.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	While it may be appropriate to say that conservatives don't think his policies will work and that is why they oppose Obama, it is entirely of line to say you hope he fails, in what world is it ok to wish for further pain, turmoil, and loss in order to prove a political point?  I'd rather be wrong than hope the country's doomed.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Freedom of Speech. It does not matter what I think.|`|sVym9MjFaa	Please, forgive Rush.  He is a good Christian conservative man who, at the time of making the remark, was still high from chewing on other men's Viagra.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Every time you use Rush's name you give him power.  Please stop.|`|FSsl25SLaa	Failed POLICIES. That's not akin to saying failed PRESIDENT.|`|2e405d18fda0a031cdc970b9510cd13caa	Nope.  Open season on Dems.  Basically a reversal of the way dems acted against GW.|`|joh3VNcZaa	No.  I do not believe that what Obama wants to do will send the country in the right direction, so I too want him to fail so America will succeed.|`|spuz7DvNaa	No. Rush wants Obama to fail if he tries to make America a socialist country. I too want hm to fail if tha is his plan and all his actions so far are headed that way.|`|AA10317675	Depends on which comments you are talking about.    I happened to see his comments on the Hannity show & they were not out of line.  On that show he made a point of saying he didn't want the country to fail or for the president to fail the country.  He just felt many of Obama's plans would be counterproductive & he hoped Obama would fail in his attempt to implement those programs.      But we all know Rush might have said some more outrageous statements earlier & he polished them up to sound nicer on the Hannity show.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Nope. Rush wants Obama's policies to fail because as he stated if they do succeed America as we know it will be gone.   I will ask you this, I have talked to many many liberals who over the past 8 years have said they wanted Bush to fail, for his policies AND the man to fail. Why is it now that Obama is in office that it is "un-American" to hope that a president fails, but just 1 year ago, liberals were saying that they wanted Bush to keep failing? Never heard a word about that.|`|AA11995584	Yes.  If you heard what he said you would know the answer to this.    If you only heard the soundbite blurb that the media gives, you would think it was out of line.    Seems I remember people saying "we support the troops, just not the mission" He supports the president, just not his intentions.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Only and idiot would believe what the Media put out about it.  Its so easy in 30 second video bites or less to take someone out of context....and its the fool that actually believes these without investigating further.  Rush was quite right when he said he hopes he fails.  Because the context was in his liberal ideology, the context was in his socialist attitude and the way the Government has been interfering with the free market and capitalism.  As a conservative Rush has lived long enough to see how those values have gotten America out of ruin in the past, yet instead of embracing what we know works, we have resorted to allowing Big Government to interfer with the process, messing up the free market not to mention expanding the national debt through the socialist idea of bail outs and hand outs. And guess what ladies and gentlemen ? It hasn't worked.  The market is tumbling at the moment not due to Bush, but because companies don' t know just how bad Obama is going to mess with their bottom line or their profits...so they stopped hiring, they stopped expanding, they stopped investing....and that's why things are getting worse. And that's why liberal ideas are flawed and socialism doesn't work.  Rush on this point is expressing his point of view based on history and facts..|`|JBK0I9aGaa	not at all.  it makes sense to want a politician's policies to fail if you feel that those policies are detrimental to the country and it's citizens.  i agree with Rush.   i think that if obama succeeds at what he said he'd do during his campaign, i'd want him to fail too.  however, if obama believes in individual responsibility, strong national defense, definite borders and punishments for those who cross them illegaly and wants to stop robbing peter to pay paul then i'd want him to succeed but so far obama has shown that doing the things that have made this country great are not on his agenda.
ac815d08d535e731adb9a4dce003e9eeaa	Same reason that the republicans didn't think the debt was a problem until Obama took office - politicians of all stripes put party before country.|`|MEReSvZeaa	They never thought it was important while Bush was in office either.

And then I remember a video I saw of a woman who voted for Obama and said (and I quote!) "Now that Obama's president I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage or putting gas in my car! I took care of him and helped him get in office and now he's going to take care of me!" This woman was crying from joy and excitement. And she was dead serious. I guess all the Obamabots think that he's going to take care of them so they don't need to worry???|`|ZXkOQapLaa	You're joking right? That's my largest concern.|`|BHeBSGemaa	I still think that they are important, and I am a liberal. Stop generalizing!|`|8DPRGTvPaa	Didn't you see us protesting the war? Obama has had to take over the worse economic situation this country has ever faced (at least since the great depression)... with all of the Republican spending, who had time to listen to the Dem's and Libs? What makes you think that anyone, and I mean ANYONE, repub or dem is not thinking about the debt and deficit right now? Why do you think that???? Did you do a survey of 5 people and that's how you came up with your assumption? Don't generalize anyone! People are lucky if they still have their jobs and even luckier if they still have their house!!! I'm so ******* tired of hearing stupid *** questions like this, get your head out of your *** and if your still working, thank your lucky stars because tomorrow you may not.

I don't think these free elections are a bad thing; they are one of the few good things about overturning the government. What some people worry about is that they have been irrelevant- until a few months ago, the government was not a major player in Iraq. Note: a lot of neocons like to say this is b.c of the surge, but actually the surge has nothing to do with it- we paid off some militias (sons of iraq if i'm getting the name right) and some of the other groups agreed to ceasefires. all of this was before the surge.  The free elections in Iraq are a direct result of the US throwing out S Hussein's gov't. He was a terrible dictator, and free elections are a good thing. however, look at what else has happened- clearly, the US had no business going into Iraq, and the results were disastrous.

The App Com doesn't do taxes.    The part of Obama's stimulus plan that changes taxes is nothing but a proposal right now in the Ways and Means Committee and is estimated at $275 billion, most of which are giveaways, not tax cuts, such as the $7500 credit given free of charge for first-time home buyers.

What to do in the mean time to prepare yourself?      Well, get into shape or better shape.  During the application process you will be required to take a PT test consisting of pull ups, push ups, sit ups, and a 1 1/2 mile timed run.    Stay clean.  Don't drink and drive, don't do marijuana, don't commit petty thefts or assaults (bar fights).    And remember that you are competing against others who already have degrees.  You need to be able to let the department know you are serious about your future.  Go to the local community college and take some classes in Criminal Justice, English, and so on.

hJNwAHccaa	Army tattoo policy states that a Soldier can have tattoos as long as they are not racist, vulgar, gang related, or sexist.

2EHpbdwIaa	Kimberly you and your partner are in whats called the poverty trap. Because you are a full time student you cant get benefits (thats if you r a Uni student, but for some full time college students it might be different), neither will your partner because he/she is working on the minimum wage. Ive spent years in the same situation, its horrible. The only way you & your partner can get out of paying the rent on the property that you live in if is you are claiming benefits. As for council tax, you dont have to pay it if you are a full time Uni student, but unfortunately your partner does because he/she is working. Your partner may however be entitled to tax credits, which are worth applying for even if you dont end up getting them. Whe I was on the minimum wage this was all the help I could find, but dont take my word for it.    If you are a Uni student & you are suffering financial hardship you can apply for a non repayable burasary, sometimes up to 2000, but you have to prove this by supplying bank statements etc. You are also entitled to a non repayable bursary of up to 1000 a year by which ever university you are studying at. If you are at college you can apply for a non repayable grant/bursary to help with transport costs, learning equipment etc (i think its called the learning support fund), I got 300 when I was at college.      Unfortunately I dont know of any other help you can get. If youve got a students union where ever you are studying it will be worth joining it & asking to see one of their financial advisers if they have one. Also contact your local education authority to see if you are entitled to any more maintainence grants & loans (phone your local council). It might also be worth booking an appointment with the C.A.B. for advice on what benefits you or your partner could be entitled to.    Good luck and all the best.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA, you will get rent rebate,and also you can claim income SUPPORT.go to Citizen advice.they will fill all the forms you need to help you get the benefits you are entitled to.its a free service,so go along and they will help you.good luck.this is in he UK.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	not sure why you have moved without realising that you are unable to pay the rent and council tax did you not do your sums beforehand? you say you are a student could you not get some paid work evenings and weekends to help out and what about your partner could he not get extra work also,  i had to do this whilst i was a student nurse on my own bringing up two children so it can be done, trouble with today is that everyone thinks that they can rely on the good old taxpayer to bail them out
Uo5wYDklaa	e = mc^2    figure out how much they used, times it by light squared, you have the energy.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	The blasts are measured in megatonnage    The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) was uneventful, and the gravity bomb known as "Little Boy", a gun-type fission weapon with 60 kg (130 pounds) of uranium-235, took fifty-seven seconds to fall from the aircraft to the predetermined detonation height about six hundred meters (1,900 ft) above the city. Due to crosswind, it missed the aiming point, the Aioi Bridge, by almost eight hundred feet and detonated directly over Shima Surgical Clinic.[20] It created a blast equivalent to about 13 kilotons of TNT. (The U-235 weapon was considered very inefficient, with only 1.38% of its material fissioning.)[21] The radius of total destruction was about one mile (1.6 km), with resulting fires across 11.4 km2 (4.4 square miles).[22] Infrastructure damage was estimated at ninety percent of Hiroshima's buildings being either damaged or completely destroyed.      At 11:01, a last minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed Bockscar's bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, to visually sight the target as ordered. The "Fat Man" weapon, containing a core of ~6.4 kg (14.1 lbs.) of plutonium-239, was dropped over the city's industrial valley. Forty-three seconds later it exploded 469 meters (1,540 ft) above the ground exactly halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works (Torpedo Works) in the north. This was nearly 3 kilometers (2 mi) northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the Urakami Valley and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills.[49] The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT. The explosion generated heat estimated at 3,900 degrees Celsius (7,000 degrees Fahrenheit) and winds that were estimated at 1005 km/h (624 mph).

Uo5wYDklaa	i think if america keeps attacking countries it will. I know that a country is northern south america allowed russia to build military bases, which are now in striking distance of any US city.    Russia came out and said it, along with the other countries. basically, "we are tired of america pushing the world around" and a lot of countries are.     Lets see, i believe it started in 1990, and from then we have invaded a country every year. Really, i dont see us any better than the nazis. What is the differnece between killing lots of people and invading countries compared to us, taking over governments and killing people and invading countries. Not much difference. Only difference is that nazis did it fast while we are taking our time and doing it in the name of "war on terror".    dont believe me? tell that to the 4237 dead iraqis and 30,000 wounded. Those are official numbers, estimates are much higher. These are civilians btw, not military.     Lets go for a second, that some country thought terrorist here in america, and they come here to fight them and 5000 american died and 40,000 were injuried, do you really think americans would be like, "its okay that russia did this, it was in the name of fighting terrorism"|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Russia has had a history of relations with Cuba and Venezuela, I don't think this is a renewed or increased threat.  I really doubt that it will lead to war between the US and Russia.  To reduce the threat though, look at the cold war, military actions like Korea and Vietnam aren't what ended the cold war, instead it was strong and steady diplomacy.  Right now we have what appears to be a good diplomat in the Oval Office and while Russia may try to test him, I think really don't think they want war either.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	With our current liberal President Russia saw an opportunity to finally plan and get at us in my opinion|`|AA11598520	Sure, I don't think Russia has ever been with the US. Russia and the former Soviet Union has always been friends with Cuba. That's not new. I am certain that Russia would be against us in most if not all wars against us.

It is the natural order of things. Eventually another country will build itself up to be a serious threat and Russia is heading towards that. Of course the US will try to prevent that, but it might not be possible.    Yes they could turn on us, eventually the world could say enough is enough and certain countries could band together to cripple us.|`|lWZi2p70aa	Well a war with Russia would certainly stop global warming in its tracks!

What kind of person actually looks up to actors and actresses, musicians, directors, etc..........pitiful! While some of them can be admired for the good they do (who couldn't do some good for others when you make 20 or 30 million a year), most of them are totally overrated and just doing their jobs.    As far as the abortion issue and Obama's promise to sign the FOCA, I am totally disgusted! While I am pro-choice, this act will allow an underage teen to obtain an abortion (with government funding) without parental consent. That steps on MY toes as a parent! I am the person responsible for the health and safety of MY child and now the government is going to take a part of MY rights away! Screw Obama and the rest of the people who are so irresponsible that they can not prevent an unwanted pregnancy, so much so that they step on my parental rights to afford others a "choice" for their irresponsible behavior!|`|IUXriZQJaa	Oh brother.    Another Obamabot.  Go watch your 'messiah' on TV and leave the rest of us alone.  It's going to be a long 4 years.

Yeah, we sure are down right racist close-minded biggots aren't we..  !!!!OMG!!!!    -Barack Obama - US President (African American)  -Deval Patrick - Gov. of Mass (African American)  -Bobby Jindal - Gov of Louisiana (Indian-American)  -Sarah Palin - Gov of Alaska (Female)  -Hillary Clinton - Secretary of State (Female)  -Nancy Pelosi Monster - House Majority Leader (Female)...maybe?  -Clarence Thomas - Supreme Court Justice - (African American)  -Mel Martinez - Jr. Senator from Florida (Hispanic)  -Bob Menendez - Jr. Senator from NJ (Hispanic)  -Solomon P. Ortiz - Rep. from TX (Hispanic)  -Dianne Feinstein - Senator from Cal (Female)    And that list could be of thousands of minorities who are serving now or have served in states all over the US. I don't think that is racism or non-tolerance. If we were that racist/sexist/whatever then it would just be a bunch of white guys like Abe and Dwight.     Americans have 0% respect for any other culture? Really now.. but you know we let everyone use the same drinking fountains and ride the same buses and go to the same schools and eat at the same restaurants. Oh my word! It's surprising that these people with 0% of respect for eachother aren't killing eachother left and right! I don't know where you live buddy boy but the majority of this country doesn't care about race or gender or whatever.     The ones that do care about race just haven't been around it enough to see through it. That is still a part of US culture that is alive and those people have never known anything but that. They were raised that way. But they are well-meaning people and they are learning.    And I'm sorry but your video of a rally in Southeast, OH is hardly a representation of Americans as a whole. I live in Southwest, OH and it's not even close to the same demographic. You're the one who says people have 0% of respect for other cultures and then you post a video that disrespects a culture. It's called the Appalachian Culture - look it up and be more tolerant. All cultures have their tensions with others. Same way with all of them. The same hatred went on at the democratic rallies. When you put that many people together with emotions being so high - people are bound to say stupid things. But on a normal day they aren't like that.    Maybe you don't know enough Americans but most of us are very, very tolerant. I don't go a day without seeing another race or gender in school, news, sports, workplaces, etc. And I don't think twice when I see someone with a different color of skin. I suppose if we are what you believe us to be then we could just kill the millions of people who don't agree with one belief or don't look like one mold, you know like say Saddam Hussein or Adolf Hitler?    And I doubt anyone would have said you are the "typical black guy". You are the one who made it a point to clarify that for some reason.. Sounds like you are a little racist to think that a "typical black guy" would be the only person to think this. How close-minded of you to think that way.    A lot of people on here don't like Obama or liberals or whatever. Dislike and hate doesn't mean they are racist or anything. They just don't agree with they way they are planning to run this country. And we are allowed to disagree all we want. I'm glad to be a part of a country who allows me to have my own mind and allows me to speak it.    I don't like Nancy Pelosi - does that make me a sexist? That would be pretty dumb considering I am a woman. Same as me not liking President Obama.. I don't agree with his policies and liberal agenda. Doesn't make me a racist. You are taking this all way out of context because you obviously don't understand the US Culture.|`|sVym9MjFaa	oH YEAH,  if you consider White Conservatives hating White Liberals a form of racism|`|2e405d18fda0a031cdc970b9510cd13caa	Yeah, and all those muslim nations are shining lights of diversity and understanding.  Let's see, when was the last time I attended a public beheading in the good ol' USA???  Hmmmmm...  Yeah, and all those women we throw acid on for going to school. or stone to death for showing their faces in public.  Yep, we sure are a sh!tty nation.  Guess you'll be catching the first thing with wings to Iraq.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	No and if you think you could make it better get out and volunteer your services then.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	John, you don't seem well, lots of pent up hate.  Go to France, lots of open minds there, just tell them you are an American...    Jesse Jackson, Louis Farakan, Rev Wright, Al Sharpton ---  we are working on these racists...|`|AA10317675	You sound like the kind of fella who assumes everyone who didn't vote for Obama was a racist.    The country just elected a black president and the Republican party just elected a Black man to run the party.  You may think it was just a token, but even if that was so, that would still mean that the Republican party thinks they will win more people into their party with this "token" than they woudl lose.  In otherwords, they think the small percentage of minorities they wn will far outnumber the bigots they will lose.  That tells you that they either think there is only a small number of bigots, or they so dislike the bigots that they don't mind losing them.    So clearly, racism is the exception, not the rule.     - - -    I hate racism of any form as well.  But I don't imagine it around every corner like some do.     - - -     The youtube clip surely shows some bigots saying outrageous stuff.  So?  We are a big country & there are loons among us.

There are no apologies for rights that were never offered to other races, and no guilt for denying any.  European counties had little need for slaves, because tillable land was not plentiful and there were few large farms and no plantations. They had no reason to make huge investments for the slaves who were being sold mainly by black people. These black slave traders are seldom condemned in today's world.   If European countries have little appetite for war, it's mainly because they expect to loose most wars.---Nothing ventured, nothing lost.    America has been a decent country that most often tried to do the right things. Blacks did not have to revolt and die in great numbers to gain their freedom. Good white people fought and died in their place,fighting against an institution that was in no way an American invention. It was only free Americans that were willing to fight and die to end it.  This may not be the greatest country, but it's better than most.    EDIT:---How in the hell did you get THAT from my answer?   What I said was that Americans were the only ones who dealt with the introduction of huge numbers of other races into their predominantly white population, and they tried to do the right things for all. Thousands of Americans died to end slavery. How many Europeans, Orientals, or Middle Easterners died to help another race.  How many blacks would have died if the situation had been reversed. If Europe had needed thousands of slaves, would European  blacks still be slaves? --- It was never a big consideration for Europe, because there were so few slaves ever needed there.

Good Luck!|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	to wish for everyone to succeed on his or her own is not cold-blooded at all.  to completely ignore those who cannot accomplish this feat and thereby allow poor to suffer, well, that's cold-blooded.  our programs should provide the incentive, monetary and otherwise, to succeed on your own, but there should be help for those who cannot.  the trick is to keep those who CAN from pretending they CANNOT.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	Welfare comes in many forms. If youre single without children it's virtually impossible to get on welfare. You can get on food stamps though. If youre going to be against welfare at least be consistent and be against corporate welfare too.|`|uithGZOwaa	No it's not bad.      Welfare is for temporary use.  I don't have a problem with giving someone a helping hand up,  I just don't want them to make it a way of life.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	it should be temporary...not a lifestyle. for example, giving medical insurance to someone who can't afford it.|`|qjquVj0daa	Welfare like many other government programs were developed with very good intentions and would work if people did not try to take advantage of it. Welfare is meant for a family with children (or single parent) as temporary bridge to help them out, so the children do not go hungry and are provided with at least the minimums. For those people is what it was meant for. Others have worked the system and taken advantage of it, I have heard comments like why would I go work for some minimum wage job where people tell me what to do? I make more on welfare than I would at a job. These are the people who do not deserve it. Or those mothers taking welfare and have a boyfriend living in the house who has a job and they do not need it, those people are not who the program was designed for, they are the ones causing your paycheck to dwindle so you can support the lazy freeloaders. The welfare system is horrible because there are many people on it who are not deserving of it. It is supposed to be a temporary social help program.|`|7ULI2TnQaa	it is not bad at all. i agree with you. i don't like it either. welfare is a joke.  people to need to step up|`|VXk8EZoHaa	IT WOULD BE OK WITH ME LESS KIDS RUNNING AROUND ON MY LAWN|`|gYNDNXAkaa	You are and quite ignorant.    You don't understand that some people don't have the opportunities others have (including white privilege).  I'm sick of people saying "Hurr, I did it, why can't you."  YOU HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES THAN OTHERS.     Born in a ghetto with little chance of getting out?  Ah, just use those bootstraps to drag yourself up.|`|RtHq6y78aa	That would make you a liberals worst nightmare.|`|9Nkru5YPaa	then that means you are a racist... get used to it|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	The problem with your analysis is that it assumes that everyone on welfare has the ability to succeed on their own.  What would you tell the hundreds of thousands of people in the US who have now laid off for no fault of there own and cannot find a job because no one is hiring?    Should they just starve to death even though they are not to blame for their current state of unemployment?|`|1FkYHLXDaa	You mean like our ancestors did? Imagine people actually having to care for themselves AGAIN. Heaven!|`|XPSIn3wxaa	That is called Capitalism.     What the Liberals all want is Socialism  everyone equally poor  except the elite who run the country, the liberals.|`|psLGl1yMaa	Well you obviously don't understand what welfare is exactly. My parents were on welfare when I was younger, and because of it they were able to do things for themselves that they would have otherwise not been able to do. My father put himself through college working a part-time job delivering pizzas which with tuition, books, and a three kids that would have been impossible for him to do without the help of welfare.     Even after he graduated college he needed to stay on it for awhile longer before he a found a stable job with decent pay to support his family. After he found a good job, he eventually was able to support his family without welfare, but without it, he would have never been able to go to college to begin with so that he could eventually support himself and his family on his own.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Welcome to the conservative way of thinking, of course just by being responsible and trying to take matters into your own hand, you will automatically be the target of a bunch of leftist. One group might hate you just for having conservative values, another because if your independant, they can't control you and they need you dependant on them for votes. Whatever the case, i'm not saying any one way is perfect, there's just better ways than others, and i've not seen anyone prosper very much by sitting on their butts and accepting what government and charity gave them. Does any smart person want to rely on those 2 entities to establish their lives and lifesyles ?  On the other hand, there will always be the downtrodden...lacking the skills, the education or maybe went bust after making an attempt to grab for the brass ring....its the fall out of capitalism, its unavoidable since there are the motivated that lost the bet along side with the unmotivated and lazy.  But at least even the "bottom' in America is still better than what you see in 3rd world countries.  People need a reality check compared to other places around the globe. They need to be grateful, responsible and stop expecting the government to violate our freedoms and treasury to help them out all the time............Independance is not a bad thing. But even in a capitalistic society, we still have minimal socialism to help the truely needy. Its a balancing act.  On the other hand, one might want to look into the failures of the Communal systems in the 80's which all failed....and why ? because it was a socialist system for a community to survive by all participants pitching in. much like the first settlement in America. But the "common stores" were often raided by the non-producers of the communtiy, and often by those that thought they were better than others and wanted to elevate themselves in society.  We call those people liberals, socialist and democrat politicans today, and whlie they struggle for power, position and make bad policy, its American citizens on both sides of the fence that get hurt.

The reason people with disabilities can't serve is because a disability naturally puts others at risk in emergency situations; in other words, if you are mute, you are usually dependent on others for emergency communications, putting you and your associates at a disadvantage.

TUPZaGjBaa	I would send my husband and friends pictures of myself or pictures of his friends at home.  Also, if you can bake like sugar cookies (no chocolate) and put them in right before you send them they will still be good. I don't know if they are into this, but my husband would have me send like 10 sudoku books because all of the guys loved sudoku.  Maybe even some manly lotion.  The air is super dry out there.  Oh and you could probably send like those individual gatorade or kool-aid packets.  You know the ones that you can pour into a water bottle and shake 'em up.  Beef jerky is a huge hit too!  Also, maybe DVD's.  I know at Wal-Mart here you can get some pretty good names of DVD's for five dollars.    The flat rate boxes are pretty good sized, medium sized I guess.  Its hard to describe.  Here are the measurements according to USPS--11" X 8.5" X 5.5" here is the link to look at it.  http://shop.usps.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...    Good luck!|`|z42u6Tbkaa	White socks. You wear them for a few days and throw them away when they're nasty. Washing socks obviously works, but they just get thin and still are gross. Nothing boosts morale like a fresh pair of socks every couple days.|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	Chewing gum, razors, razor refills, beef jerky, candies (hard ones you suck on), band aids, moleskin, and although this is a bit TMI my husband always asked for toilet paper.  The soft double quilted kind.  I guess their 1 ply is rough on their bums.  I also sent some creams etc for their bums.  Magazines, books, DVD's, socks, green tees, travel games (like you would take on a road trip), crackers, kool aid and Gatorade packets, pocket tissues, shampoo, AXE body wash, nail clippers, shower shoes, sheets washed and put in a big zip lock so he could sleep on clean sheets that smell good, extra under clothes, and I think that's about it.

Whether or not the parents were married can also impact the child's nationality, if the parents were unmarried at the time birth and the child was born before January 2006 the child can't claim citizenship through the father.      You need to speak to the Passport Office about whether or not your child is entitled to British citizenship or the Home Office.  Your son could also speak to the British Embassy or Consulate which is closest to him, if he's based in the US, if he's entitled to a British passport he'll be able to apply through the British Embassy.      http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britis...

93M8Vccvaa	The trooper was right. Show the receipt or any proof to the court that your taillights are working and the judge may reduce or dismiss the ticket. You may still have to pay court costs though. You don't have to wait until your court date. Call the court and set up a time you can meet with them and go to where they are and show them your receipt and or proof you have taken care of it.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Why in the world would you even be involved in this?    You should pay the fine (probably less than $100) and move on.  It is a misdemeanor and involves no points, usually.    The law is that you are responsible for the condition of the vehichle you drive.  That includes insurance.  You might want to quit while you are even (don't be concerned with getting ahead).  If you are asked by the court to show proof of insurance at the time you drove the car, you are probably screwed without a kiss.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Very high....fix the tail light then take a picture of it and inform the judge that the police did not ticket you correctly.

You could win the case, particularly if officer a) does not show, b) shows without independent recollection of the incident and/or c) testifies but doesn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you are guilty of the offense.    It's not  a moving violation so don't worry about points.|`|8b9abf4146d73b8aad5200a1598aa6b9aa	I think it's pretty easy to change a court date, just call in.    Also I think you have a pretty good chance of getting it dropped.  Plus you have nothing to lose.  I'd get them fixed.  Driver the car there so you can show the judge it's been fixed and explain your situation.     You basically have nothing to lose.|`|Lnrhs46laa	Okay, I would bet you have a good chance of getting it dismissed.    I would get the light fixed and take the receipt with you to court. Take a picture if you fix it yourself. Explain to the judge what had happened. Show him you were responsible and had it fixed right away with the receipt or picture or both.     That should do the trick. If they don't dismiss it, most likely they will reduce the ticket. If they decide to stick you with the ticket, they have payment options available if you cannot afford to pay it.     Changing your court date is not a problem. They understand that you have a life too. There should be a phone number or something on the ticket for the courthouse, call them and they can direct you on what to do to change your court date.    Just make sure you show up! They will issue a bench warrant for failure to appear if you do not show.    Good Luck!

If it is an emergency concerning you, then it is up to the discretion of the unit to allow him to go home or not because you are not considered immediate family because you are only his girlfriend, not his wife.    Give it a little while longer.  I'm pretty sure his unit will allow him to call you but you have to understand that mission will take priority and unfortunately because you are not considered immediate family, it will have to wait until he has the time to call you.|`|yR75rXThaa	It really depends where he is and what his job is.    You can be certain he received it, the Army is very quick about that and they have their own internal communication networks over there to get it done (SIPR VOIP, CENTRIX [NATO] VOIP, and NIPR telephone) most of which don't have a switch to the regular telephone system to call home.    If he's an infantryman or in another MOS that has him outside the wire, he may be out of communication from you until he can get back to a Forward Operating Base (FOB) with a phone line to home. The terrain there is pretty restrictive to vehicles, so if he's not in Bagram, Kandahar, or Salerno they'll have to schedule a helicopter ride for him back to a main base to get in touch with you.    Be patient, but know that he got the message.

ArhIqecxaa	The current version of the Ranger creed dates to July of 74, but a version of it was in existence during WW2  The NCO creed dates back to the earliest of times of the NCO.  The current version is given a 1973 time period as its date.  Go to armystudyguide.com and link to sites there or go to FM7-22.6 or DA Pam 600-25 for slight variations of bygone creeds.   The Ranger creed either the Battalion, Regiment or "Ranger School" is still in contest of each other as late as of  "today".  It boiles down to which one you want to pledge allegiance with and recognize as the official version..
C7CaNLGlaa	It's already happening and with the help of your leaders.  Geert Wilders, a Dutch film director made a movie about Islam and its dangers.  He was charged with "hate crimes."  What should have happened is that he should have been celebrated for opening peoples' eyes that their countries are being taken right out from under them without a shot fired.      In Sweden the Muslim population is wearing T-shirts that saying "20 more years."  Meaning, in 20 years they will be the dominant population.    And look what "diversity" and "multiculturalism" has brought France.  Nightly riots and the destruction of cars.  In Britain, you have no-go zones in your own country.  In Spain, and England, blowing up trains and busses seems to be the main activity.  Then when you extend the hand of Welfare to these cave dwellers, they smite you, but gladly take the money so they can protest in the streets about the very freedoms they have so they can protest.      And if we don't wake up, America will suffer the same fate.  We can't just mumble "racism" and go back to sleep.|`|mmSzmGX2aa	Always time for another genocide.

Lord Ahmed is a repugnant individual. Not only in appearance, but in association, character and morality. And to hear that he has threatened jihad on the House of Lords if their lordships should fail to meet his demands only serves to intensify Cranmers loathing of the man.     It appears that a member of the House of Lords had invited the Dutch politician, Geert Wilders, to a private meeting in the Palace of Westminster. She had intended to invite her colleagues in the Lords to a private viewing of his documentary Fitna, followed by discussion and debate in true parliamentary fashion. This is, after all, a liberal democracy, and their lordships enjoy the rights of freedom of expression and freedom of association, not to mention certain parliamentary privileges for the protection of their function in the legislature.     But no sooner had the unsuspecting baroness sent out her invitations, Lord Ahmed raised hell. It is reported that he threatened to mobilise 10,000 Muslims to prevent Mr Wilders from entering the House and threatened to take the colleague who was organising the event to court.     And so Fitna has been cancelled: it shall not now be screened in the House of Lords on 29th January.     The Pakistani Press is jubliant, and Lord Ahmed is praising Allah for delivering a victory for the Muslim community.     It is a sorry state of affairs indeed that a parliament whose liberties have been forged through centuries of religious intolerance should succumb to the threats of one intolerant Muslim. Lord Ahmed is manifesting a notion of Divine Right, and one suspects it is precisely the sort of defence of Islam that Prince Charles shall make when he is sworn Defender of Faith. The blasphemy laws are being re-forged to protect one god, one faith and one prophet; they no longer defend YHWH, Christianity, Jesus Christ or the Church of England. Lord Ahmed is not functioning as a Labour peer; he is the self-appointed khalifa of all things Islamic. He is not concerned to protect freedom of expression or freedom of speech, but to stifle debate and ensure that Parliament submits to the Dar Al-Islam.     It is for moments such as these that one might hope the Lords Spiritual might enter the fray and defend the right of the noble baroness to extend an invitation to a democratically-elected Dutch MP. Their silence is deafening. They no longer believe anything strongly for fear of causing offence; they no longer defend anything for fear of being abolished.     If Lord Ahmed had threatened Cranmer with 10,000 Muslims to prevent Mr Wilders from entering the House, His Grace would have assured his Lordship of 100,000 people of all faiths and none to prevent the Muslims from preventing Mr Wilders from entering the House.     There are occasions when turning the other cheek is sheer folly.|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	I read somewhere they will start this by having as many babies here as possible to increase their population.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	The Muslim world was technologically and culturally advanced when most of Europe was populated by people who couldn't read and were afraid to bathe.

I do not think Europeans are up to the task.  Unlike the United States they do not have a strong sense of nationalism.  In fact they see patriotism as a mental illness. Lacking a strong sense nationalism or patriotism, they are easy targets.  They are already loosing their identity to Muslims who immigrate there but have no intention of identifying themselves as part of anything but Islam.      I predict many more nights of riots and car burnings like we saw in France not too long ago.

Muslims on the whole are peace loving, wanting to get on with life, work etc, just having a chance to make life work for them, without taking away chances for anyone else who is willing to make an effort.    And you don't think the USA has anything to do with extremism?  People like Bush and his ilk are so fundamentalist that it just invites fundamentalist thinking.  Many Muslims would not agree with what the Islam fundamentalists are saying, and most of them are happy to work within given circumstances.  I am really seeing a lot of racism in these replies.

4VzVfKvdaa	30 days overdue no.  That being said, he needs to get to finance and sort it out ASAP.  I had the same problem only worse.  I was on a TDY from one location to an overseas location and it was paid for by a third location.  I ran out of money for my hotel and they would not advance me anymore money because no one would decide who was responsible.  Like someone else already said, the card program sucks for everyone except the bank that issues them.  It just doesn't seem fair for a card issued to you by the government affects your credit because THEY did not pay it.  My situation was so ridiculous that when I returned to my unit, I turned my card in and so did my commander as a show of support.  From then, they had to give me cash advances for all my TDYs.  I learned that they cannot...I repeat...cannot make you use a government charge card even though federal says you have to.  The CAN say you are no longer worldwide deployable if you refuse, but then that sort of screws the military.  Interesting stat for you...almost 30% of military card holders are delinquent on their charge cards..some by as much as 120 days...mainly due to back to back deployments...so their credit is screwed.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	It really depends on the whole circumstances.

You have to stay on top of finance and keep all receipts, emails and copies of any communications. You might have to pay it for now and wait to get your money back...it bites and I think it hurts more service members than it helps.

If you went TDY (or whatever) and you got your travel pay, then a portion of that money is supposed to go to pay towards your govt travel card.  I helped my unit manage DTS and this is what I tell them every single time...when you get your travel pay from your voucher, pay your GOVC first.  If you haven't gotten paid your travel pay, then you need to go see finance (if PCS) or your DTS manager (if TDY).    The only way you would get in serious trouble is if you used your GOVC like it was a personal credit card...like taking out a cash advance or making personal purchases.  What I mean by that is...don't go buying your buddies a plane ticket for them to come out and see you so y'all can party it up at the clubs.      As long as you are not at fault then you'll be fine but you do need to find out why you didn't get reimbursed for your travel card.

They lie over and over about species of animals that need protection to stop good economical and clean environmentally friendly projects. That is what we need, environmentally friendly but economically potent projects like hydro electric, nuclear electric, natural gas drilling, things like that.    They also implement idiotic forestry regulation that decimated whole industries and drove up the price of building materials ... and why? So the fuel could build up and super fires which burn so hot and in such expanses that they destroy the recovery mechanisms that naturally occur in forests. The seeds which would spout within a days of a fire and start laying cover and support upcoming trees and hold the soil? burned to the point they are powder, even though they require heat from a fire to activate, they are totally destroyed, along with the trees, and we are left with dead soil that erodes away. Then the idiots blame it on a 1.5 degree increase in temperature, even though the temps have been going down steadily for 10+ years globally?    These so called environmentalist friends of Gore are NOT environmentalists, they are profiteers just like Al Gore who use the titles and the shielding of "Science" to fleece us and in the mean time they screw up our environment and take away from what could be excellent productive programs which are both environmentally friendly, and user friendly. When it comes to the point of save the environment or starve, the environment will suffer because it will drop of the priority list as it has in many countries. We had better live in harmony with the environment and do business as we can taking advantage of the wood while we regrow the forests, because burning them down isn't good for anyone, and talk about carbon emissions? One good forest fire puts out more carbon emissions that people do in years world wide.    We need to be honest with environmentalism, and balanced.

AA11494150	If you are referring to the BART incident, I doubt he mistook his gun for a taser, as it does not appear he would have been justified to use that either.     I suspect the incident was caused by something called "sympathetic reaction". This occurs when a movement on one side of your body is replicated by a subconscious movement on the other side. In other words, a compression of his left hand was replicated in his right hand, causing him to subconsciously squeeze the trigger. The look of surprise on his face immediately after leads me to believe it was not his intent to shoot.     My theory certainly does not justify the shooting, nor does it excuse negligence,  as the officer should have been consciously aware of what he was doing.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Because they are people, people make mistakes. I agree that it is unacceptable that one would mistake them. It will unfortunately happen from time to time.

I agree that cops should get more training.|`|WaI693jHaa	No amount of training can prepare a person for being in a position where they may get killed unless they react in a split second.  I'm not saying the police don't screw up or that there aren't just some really bad coppers out there, but I don't think many of us have been in a situation to know.|`|ohUm00RYaa	I highly doubt it was a mistake.  Anyone who has handle both a hand gun and taser knows there is no similarity between the two at all.  They feel different, weaigh different, or even pulled different.

As to a Taser not having a safety?  Not right, a Taser has a safety.      As to a Taser not feeling like a gun?  Not right, a Taser has the same basic feel as a Glock.    As to wearing them on opposite sides of the body?  That is the preferred method, but not mandated.  Some departments have Tasers on the same side.    How do we stop this?  More training for the police, and less crime committed by the criminal.    As to all terrorist being linked to the US Gov?

9e57750ed3c826124966326d438d7e96aa	You cannot be unlawfully kept on remand in the UK.    Only a magistrate or judge can order you to be remanded on the basis of evidence or argument presented by the prosecuting authority. Further, it should be the presumption of the court that you will not try to evade justice, and hence should NOT be remanded, unless there is reasonable cause to believe otherwise. Sadly prejudice sometimes figures in this decision and people are remanded without reasonable cause. However, the arguments are very subjective in these matters and such errors are rarely challenged. Much really depends on the quality of your legal representative and of the prosecution.     If you feel that your remand was unreasonable your solicitor should should be able to guide you down any legal avenues that are available to you. If they say you have no foundation for any action then really all you can do is complain to your MP or try and get the media involved.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	How about your solicitor?!

ffkIisYwaa	First, congratulations on choosing to serve your country.    Now on to the question.    No one can tell you when or whether or not you should get married and I'm not going to either.  As far as living on post, you MUST know that the housing for junior enlisted is not that great.  You didn't mention that you were going to be enlisted or officer, but I'm presuming you are going enlisted.  The military pays people subsidies if they live off post and they will follow.  A lot of Marines have families and it can be done, but understand that it is called Service for a reason.  There are many wives and especially EX-wives, who feel/felt that the service comes/came first, then their friends, then the kids, and lastly them.  I won't belabor the point that everyone is on back-to-back-to-back year-long deployments other than to mention it and state that this has been a reason for the higher rates of divorce in the military.    One other note, you wrote, "I don't want to just leave her behind and say, "see you in 4 years"."  In point of fact you will leave her behind: you will leave her behind during deployments and unaccompanied year long tours to 'peaceful' locations like South Korea.  If this marriage is to survive a 20+year Marine career or even a FOUR YEAR HITCH this needs to be discussed, but I am certain you have done this already.  Here are some additional figures  An E-2 or E-3 receives $604.50 or $634.20 depending on rank a 2nd Lt. receives $820.50, single Marines receiving about $200.00 less each month.  These dollars (BAH Basic Allowance for Housing) are TAX FREE and you also you will receive BAS (Basic Allowance for Subsistence) which is also tax-free the amounts are $323.87 or $223.04 for enlisted and officers, respectively.    Hope this helps.|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	The Marine Corps has been given the stereotype of not being good to families.  They are trying to change that.  The Key Volunteer Network is being changed into the Family Readiness program.  So your Recruiter was right about that.    For about the first year after you reenlist you will be gone. (boot camp, MCT or SOI depending on your MOS and then possibly MOS school) If you want to get married before boot camp then you will receive BAH and your entitlements that she could save to set up the household when you do get your first duty station.      You will possibly deploy.  That is something you will always have to keep in the back of your mind.  But, I honestly don't see why you can't have your career in the Marines and a family.      Good luck|`|2b403075f2d2d0c3a6d1d818fdfbe9ffaa	You didn't say how old you were, so I'm assuming that you are 18 - 21 years old.    If your heart is set on being in the Marines, do it, or you'll always regret it if you don't.   The Marines are the finest fighting force in the World, and you're a good man if you join them.    The marriage is a separate issue, as it takes a very mature couple to survive military living, regardless of which branch you're in.    I would talk it over with your girlfriend and put off the marriage for the first year in the Marines.  If you really are meant for each other, the relationship will endure, and you'll each be better for the delay.  It will give you a chance to be a good Marine and her a chance to see how military life will affect her relationship with you.    Besides, you will be a changed man after your first few months in the Marines, and she may have problems with that.|`|aafd1959948a9f0fa652532751b3ee2baa	My husband is a Marine, we have been together for 3 years, he has been in the Marine Corps for about 5 years. He has served twice in Iraq totaling 17 months. He will be leaving again within the near future.     I love the Marine Corps. They care about the family, they care about us "left" behind when they are off at war. When my husband was deployed the second time; there was always family gatherings for us spouses and children. There is a thing call the Key Volunteer Network (which I am a part of) we have a phone list and certain spouses that we keep in contact with at least once a week. Every spouse has a KV, especially when there husband's are deployed. Its a great Network that helps you when you need it the most.    Your MOS will depend on how long your away from your wife.     We live in base housing and its great for him and I we both are close to our jobs. I wouldn't change a thing about my life or what I married into. When my husband re-enlisted 2 years ago I was right next to him "swearing in" for another 4 great years.    If you have any more questions just let me know :)|`|3ZsbbfY7aa	If you lover her really lover her then get married for the right reasons. The military is hard on everyone tell me about it. My husband of 11 1/2 months is in the Marines. And yes it is hard but I love him. There will be time apart but at the end of the day I know why. And I believe in his worth and the commitment that we both have made. His job is very important. Yes I do miss him our new baby dose too. I will say the USMC is one of the hardest branches but in all any branch of service  is to be looked  upon as honorable. The USMC takes care of the family. Very good care. But with any Military you are not trained to stay around on the base. When you singe on line your are doing a job and it will be your first wife. Even when your "real 1st "wife misses you, she will have to be strong and understand what she is getting into. It takes two to deal with the stress. But there are a lot of positives.     This is how it really go's  ( As it was for us)  1st of all are you at the right weight and height?  2nd based on your ASVB score you'll find out what jobs there are.  3rd of all if you are you'll get a ship date to either Paris Island or Camp Pen.ect  4th you will only get one 5 sec phone call to tell them you are at your camp that is prescriptive. You will not write right away to your loved ones. But 4-6 weeks yes you will, when you have time.  5th Your 1st drill instructor will send a letter to tell your family about your set day of graduation.  6th you will need to send information to your loved ones about hotels etc.  7th if you are not infantry you can get up to 30 days at home.  8th If you are Infantry you have 10 days at home  9th You will have 3-4 weeks at Combat training You will have chances to call on the weekends if you earn liberty- some times it is restricted to areas on the base and you may not be able to go to the Main area. On your last liberty is off base. You can take your cell-phone but only have it on at those times, also do not walk and talk on your phone. They do not like that at all.     10th Then you go to school.-(29plams maybe) Depending on what your schooling is will depend if your dependents can  live on that base. If your schooling is over 26 weeks is what I have been told. Your work is Pt then 9-5 classes. To be honest she is better off at home living her life so you can focus on your school work it is very hard classes and if you fail them you will have to retake them...you will be there even longer and you will not receive your singe on bonus until you finish your school. When your at school they will tell you what duty station your going to. When you find out what base your going to you need to call that base and talk the housing people and get on the list. After your school is done you will be transferred to that base. When you get there you will need to talk to your 1st Sargent to ask for leave so you can move her to that base. You may only get 2 weeks but I have heard that some have gotten 30 days. You'll need to wait until your housing is available. This could take a long time to get housed on base. Yet there are other ways. Living off base in surrounding area's. The housing people will know about them. Also they can tell you were on the list you are.      11th Also you earn more money if your married- thus being your housing allowances and she will also have medical.   12th When you do get to our base with your wife you maybe deployed within 6 months. Like I said they train you for service  not to live on the base and walk around. Once your on the list as a trained personal they need you ASAP. When you meet up with your new group they want to male sure you know what is going on they want to make sure of your training.   I love the USMC  It has given my hubby so very much, he has gotten alot form his training and has become more then he ever thought he would. He was a country boy in Michigan just working for his Dad. Now he is a man. A USMC MAN. A proud solider, willing to lie his life down for his country.       Hope that this helps!

NrkWd4Aoaa	Filibusters can only occur in the Senate.  A filibuster is an attempt to extend debate for as long as the party can stand it, in order to delay or prevent a vote.    I'm pretty sure that any president wants a filibuster-proof senate if his party is the majority party, because his own party is not likely to filibuster something that the president wants. If his party is the minority party then he might not want a filibuster-proof senate.  60 votes are required to end a filibuster.    President Bush wanted a filibuster proof senate, particularly when it came to attempts to filibuster federal court nominees.  Wouldn't surprise me if Obama wants one, too.       To override a veto requires action by both the House and the Senate. A 2/3 majority of members present is required to override a veto.  If all 100 senators are present then 67 must vote to override a veto in the Senate.  Even then, the House would also have to vote by a 2/3 majority to override the veto.    If one house fails to override the veto then there is no point in the other house taking its vote.    In the history of the U.S. only 106 vetos have been successfully overridden.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	With a filibuster-proof Senate, Obama and the Democratic majority in Congress could pass any bills and legislation through without ANY opposition whatsoever. Our country would go into a tail spin if that ever happened.    A filibuster is a way to obstruct legislation from passing by indefinitely extending the debate on it.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	I like a 50/50 split.  If any one party has too much power look out!

You'll laugh.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Overriding a veto and filibuster are two different concepts.     A filibuster is when the Senate minority prevents a bill from being voted on. You need 60 votes to "invoke cloture", that is, to bring a bill to a vote.    Obama wants to have 60 votes to prevent Democratic bills from being filibustered. The previous Senate Republicans filibustered 80 times, preventing the Democrats from doing anything.    If a President vetoes a bill, the Congress can override that veto with a certain number of votes -- I think it's 2/3, but not sure.|`|spuz7DvNaa	So he can rape the taxpayers with impunity. So he can redefine America to a communist/socialist country. This wolf in sheep's clothing wants no obstacles.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	It means that whatever bills he wants passed can pass without any opposition.      He will be God with that and the checks and balances won't exist anymore.|`|AA11450062	A filibuster is where they talk and talk and talk about the issue until someone calls uncle and they can`t vote. Leave it up to Republicans to obstruct progress.|`|89239f44272f2582fcdd0bed556489b2aa	Any one senator can hold up a bill and stop it from consideration by the entire Senate. The only way around that one Senator is if any 60 other Senators vote to end the fillibuster (holding of the bill).    Having 60 votes means that the majority can vote and pass measures. Bills can pass with only 51 votes, but require the super majority of 60. Most laws only require the simple majority. However, imagine if you are a Senator and feel that you see a serious flaw with a law that no one else sees. Perhaps the law would hurt your state specifically and you object for the reason. This gives that one person the ability to stop the measure while still allowing the majority to over ride the one person.     Fillibusters make all the other senators stop and think: "One of the other Senators sees something really wrong with this bill. Let me take another look". They might conclude that the person has a point...or they might conclude that they don't. Fillibusters force everyone to take a second look at what is being done.|`|f2588e1703510da6a578c2465a4b68faaa	Filibuster  In legislative procedure, term denoting the means employed by members of a legislative assembly to delay or prevent action on a measure to which they are opposed. Such means may include the introduction of dilatory motions, intentional absence from the assembly in order to prevent the existence of a quorum, or the presentation of abnormally long, often meaningless speeches.  Encarta Encyclopedia    Plain and Simple:  Obama wants a filibuster-proof senate so he can get whatever bills he wants passed and the opposition can't do anything to stop him.
3iL7V04waa	Ask the recruiters exactly what you want to know.  The Marines and the Air Force are vastly different.  Generally speaking, the Marines is considered to be the hardest, and the Air Force is considered to be the easiest in terms of physical challenge.    You cannot be in DEP until you meet the initial physical requirements.  So basically, you need to lose the weight before you can enlist.  While in DEP, they'll help you get down to a good weight, but most of it is on your own.  In DEP you learn basic things about the military branch you're joining, including PT, General Orders, basic marksmanship, teamwork, etc.  If you cannot get down to your 155, you need to make sure to get down to the body fat percentage of your age and gender.  When you talk to a recruiter, ask them about the tape test (to find body fat percentage).|`|FQyp3K8Naa	DEP doesn't work that way.  No matter the branch of service, you have to meet basic entry requirements to become apart of DEP.  There are 3 categories that you have to be concerned with: Mental, Physical and Moral.  You have to have a good enough ASVAB score to enlist, you have to meet physical standards and you cannot have serious civil or traffic history.   On another note, why are you just limiting yourself to one branch.  Each branches specific requirements vary.  There are too many questions to ask.  I could go on and on.  If you are really serious about joining, make an appointment with a recruiter and discuss your intentions and goals.  If you do have alot of weight to loose, they'll give advice....I did.  A good recruiter will give you a guideline to follow and, if you qualify, they will get you into service.  I hope that helped abit.|`|bxbnhyUnaa	yea like your bonus, money, loan repayment, there is alot of things you need to know. unless you just want in.

wt3gpKEqaa	I used to be a Physical Training Instructor in the British Army, we also use the 1.5 mile run as part of our basic fitness test.     I'm going to break my answer down in to three parts. Form, breathing and knowledge.    Form.     Half the challenge with running is technique, or form. It's not about how fast you run per se. As I'm sure you are aware, muscles require a constant stream of oxygen to keep going. I know you say that you're not necessarily winded, but trust me, when you get your breathing down, running becomes quite simple and the physical aspect is maintainable with minimal effort in your weekly fitness routine.  After that, it is all mental stamina to keep going and pushing yourself to a best effort.    So anyway, you should run heel to toe, heel to toe. Pushing off on your toe and not lifting your feet very far off the ground, conserving energy. Also, let your arms dangle slightly, as holding them up uses vital energy.    Breathing.    You should breathe in sharp for 2 paces and then out for 3. So it sounds like "few,few,fooo,fooo,fooo". It's all about getting the oxygen in while remaining in control of the cycle, not letting it control you. While training, it is key that you keep that rate of breathing going. If you can't, you waste vital oxygen and just one or two bad cycles of breathing can screw you up for the run.     Knowledge.    Some basic maths:    1.5 miles = 7920 feet.    So, you need to be able to run :    7920 / 10.5 minutes = 754 feet a minute required to pass. Or, about 250 yards a minute.    With that knowledge in hand, you can now develop a training routine. On remedial fitness training for our injured soldiers, we used the following training techniques:    Interval Training.    Sprints of various distances, all covered at maximum pace and with half the time it takes for you to complete the run as rest between sprints.     An example is 4 x 400 meters, which is 1 miles in total.     Try to run the 400 meters in under 60 seconds, then take 30 seconds off. Then run again, 30 seconds off until you have done this all 4 times. The pace required is that of the 1.5 mile in 10 minutes exactly, so if you can keep it up, you're doing very well. Of course, to start with, you will struggle, but it beats doing a boring 1.5 mile run every day just to find you haven't run it faster. What we're trying to achieve here is the ability to get the right pace memorized and also pushing your heart and lungs, as well as your muscles. With a larger lung capacity, you will be able to distribute more oxygen. With a stronger heart, you will pump more oxygenated blood around faster, allowing you to keep going longer and faster!    Once you are happy with the 400 meters, you can then start doing 3 x 800 meters, which is 1.5 miles. So 800 meters in 2 minutes with 1 minute breather in between runs.    fartlek training.     Basically, go for a jog. Now break it up by randomly sprinting at various speeds until failure, then jog very slowly to recover. Never walk or stop. Try and do this for 30-40 minutes. What we're doing here is making your muscles more flexible to carry out different speeds. In the 1.5 mile run, this is important as at the end you should try and sprint the last 200 yards if possible. This training is the best training I have ever done to increase my run times. I managed sub-8 minutes with this technique alone.    I used to run 5 days a week to build myself to the correct level, but once you are at the correct level, you will manage by doing 2x fartlek and 1x interval training a week, I promise!|`|FJ4rJdkraa	A faster running speeed means your performance level has increased...Here is a very good way to increase your performance level but first here is what I did.    I too had a tough time meeting the requirements but I did perform a daily regiment of running and weight lifting training and tried to loose a little weight. I was not chubby in any sense of word and I did find that a daily regiment of basic walking then going to running helped a ton...  If you work out more than once per day it may seem as though you will gain more muscle than gain the endurance you need. Start today and work out slowly then harder. Use the leg trainer in the gym lift only light weights then a little heavier. Then in 3 days include arm weight training ...Light weights as compared to increasing to a much heavier weight is best for endurance training. Don't forget to run every day..    Find a person in your gym that can help with proper breathing techniques. Breathing proper while running will make a big difference in reducing time. Also, an out of balance can ruin your time so be sure to do a total workout. Legs, arms, sit ups etc. Good luck, keep track of your daily performance level and I think you will do well.

I'd tell that voice, "What do you want, present comfort or a Navy career? You can't have both. If you want a career as a Navy Officer, then DO IT!!! Otherwise, forget it."    There were times in my career I could have wimped out. It's a matter of discipline. Bluntly, if you don't have the self-discipline to do that, maybe you don't have what it takes to be a Navy Officer.    I knew a Navy Officer who used to say, "I realize I'm a woman in what has traditionally been a 'man's world' and that I have to do twice the job a man has to do to get the same recognition." Then she'd add with a smirk, "And I do it." She swam in a meet in San Diego and took a first, two seconds and a third... and she was the only woman swimming. She was consistently recommended for deep selection... you'll learn about that.    It's a tendency among women to lack upper body strength. That problem seems to be compounded for you. Do as many push-ups as you can... to failure... that means that it's not that you don't want to do more... you physically can't, rest a few seconds -- maybe a minute -- and then do some more. Make your body do more than it thinks it can. Don't go for 50 push-ups right now. Start with five -- rest a few seconds and then do five more -- and then five more. When you've done that 10 times, you'll have done your 50.... now, go for 100. Pretty soon you'll be doing sets of 10... then 20... etc.    Running... watch your knees... but, just as with push-ups, over train... practice doing more than you're going to need to do. Remember the requirements are MINIMUM requirements. You're expected to surpass them. So train for a five-mile run. To get your speed up, try pushing the last quarter mile.. then the last half mile... see where this is going?    Most women aren't as strong as most guys. But some are stronger. They weren't born that way... they worked at it.    If you're going for a Staff position, OCS is (or was) a whole lot easier... more like an indoctrination.    I went to OCS in late 1964. That was back before the Earth cooled, so some of my information may be a little dated. But the stuff about fitness isn't.

So rather than give people an opportunity they didn't have before based on a few obsticals in their way....which Government is becoming a big obstical to some people. And to people that deserve the chance.  He is reaching down to those that really don't deserve the chance because they didn't put in the work, or the time, or prepare...and is instead handing alot to people based on color, or living conditions, or some kind of segregated border.  He supports unions for instance which are 12% in America...and steadily decreasing...why ? because most of America doesn't need them...although there use to be a time they did right by workers than themselves.  Look at the teachers Union as a great example of how more money doesn't actually go to the children, since some of the highest capita per child states have the lowest scores.

YsUnEnYqaa	Do you understand what it is that Blackwater does?    It is NOTHING besides executive protection that is common in the States and training services.... They have heavy weaponry because the country they work in tends to have things like.... ohhhhh... snipers, car bombs, militias going crazy and mutilating people.....etc.    There is nothing unethical about it. It is strictly defensive in nature, and at a lower cost to the taxpayer than traditional military forces filling the roles.     If, private security contractors were not permitted to work in Iraq / Afghanistan, then the void would be left so wide that the US Government would be FORCED to draft young kids like your classmates to fill these needs....

I apologize I don't know any details, but try googling something on what they are allowed to do. Some of the things they do are considered against the law, yet they are exempt. That may be one point you want to hit on. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

Two ways to get Recon..    1) When you enlist you get the try out guarantee in your contract. This means you will be given a try out for Recon. If you pass you continue, if you fail you go on with whatever your MOS was.    2) When you arrive in your unit and when you feel you are ready you can request to try out for Recon.     Most Recon Marines come from the infantry MOS's,  but this is NOT required. Common sense will tell you a infantryman has more of a chance to pass since this is what he does day in day out,  but anyone can apply.|`|p21qJQ4Jaa	Force Recon doesnt even exist anymore....what is known as a Recon is now MARSOC, which is a completely different little side branch that you can be selected for once screend at SOI and you pass your endoc.

L7BSLB6faa	The facts just don't back up the exaggerated rhetoric.    How about a little sanity from factcheck.org?    ACORN Accusations  October 18, 2008  McCain makes exaggerated claims of "voter fraud." Obama soft-pedals his connections.  Summary  The McCain-Palin campaign accuses ACORN, a community activist group that operates nationwide, of perpetrating "massive voter fraud." It says Obama has long and deep ties to the group. We find both claims to be exaggerated. But we also find Obama has understated the extent of his work with the group.    Neither ACORN nor its employees have been found guilty of, or even charged with, casting fraudulent votes. What a McCain-Palin Web ad calls "voter fraud" is actually voter registration fraud. Several ACORN canvassers have been found guilty of faking registration forms and others are being investigated. But the evidence that has surfaced so far shows they faked forms to get paid for work they didnt do, not to stuff ballot boxes.      Obamas path has intersected with ACORN on several occasions  more often than he allowed in the final debate.   ***************    For the entire analysis go to: http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/...|`|eulMjLtPaa	Obama was one of several lawyers for one ACORN case.  He is not affiliated with them beyond that.    There have never been any voting irregularities affiliated with ACORN; they have all been voter *registration* irregularities, which have been discovered and never made it to the voting booth.     The stimulus package does not go to ACORN.  It goes to neighborhood revitalization projects.  Yes, this is true, no matter how many thumbs down I get.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Obama didn't work for Acorn; he was one of several lawyers that were used in a case against Acorn many years ago.

It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money does not go to home buyers who used bad judgment, it hasn't announced it. <br>  <br>  Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it's important to save some of those people for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. <br>  <br>  "I think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed." <br>  <br>  Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it's not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn't afford. <br>  <br>  "I think it's just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans," Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "We have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don't mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. <br>  <br>  Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won't be 10 years from now. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn't only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That's all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama's proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely targeted by presidents who later find that the savings realized seldom amount to significant sums. Programs that a president might consider wasteful have staunch defenders in Congress who have fought off similar efforts in the past. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  ------ <br>  OBAMA: "Over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs." <br>  THE FACTS: This is a recurrent Obama formulation. But job creation projections are uncertain even in stable times, and some of the economists relied on by Obama in making his forecast acknowledge a great deal of uncertainty in their numbers. <br>  The president's own economists, in a report prepared last month, stated, "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error." <br>  Beyond that, it's unlikely the nation will ever know how many jobs are saved as a result of the stimulus. While it's clear when jobs are abolished, there's no economic gauge that tracks job preservation. The estimates are based on economic assumptions of how many jobs would be lost without the stimulus. <br>  ------ <br>  OBAMA: "First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running." <br>  THE FACTS. Obama appeared to be referring to an expanded Federal Reserve program established in the Bush administration but never activated. The program would unclog consumer lending, allowing the Fed's program to expand to $1 trillion from $200 billion. The Fed said it will lend the money to banks and other financial institutions in order to spur more lending by those companies through credit cards and student and auto loans. <br>  ------ <br>  Associated Press writer Tom Raum contributed to this story.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	Because BO is a horrible leader and will drive this country into the ground.<br>  <br>  .|`|PPKuHl9baa	Investors are immune to Obama-mania.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Why doesn't anyone understand how causation works?|`|mkEGjlmNaa	Because socialism does not breed prosperity|`|1amF7oNwaa	I ALSO NOTICED THAT, WONDER WHY?

Conservatives cant offer much of anything to your working or middle class because many of you people WANT a big nanny state where big government doesnt hold you responsible for anything!  Big government is expected to take care of everything for you.  It will also take away your hard earned dollars and give it to someone else because big government thinks that it knows how to spend your money better than you do.  It will provide high paying union jobs where time on the job is more valuable than actually DOING the job.  It will provide your medical insurance, it will provide your college tuition, it will give you loans that you are unqualified for, it will provide for your retirement and it will support any illegal immigrants who manage to sneak in.  Conservatives on the other hand think that everyone should be responsible for themselves but are more than generous when people in real distress need help.    p.s.:  Freedom of CHOICE doesnt mean that women get to decide whether they have the right to murder someone.  If you are referring to the right to abortion, their CHOICE should have been to keep their knees together in the first place.  Why would a woman have sex with someone that they wouldnt want to have children with in the first place?  Oh, Is sorry, you are referring to sports sex arent you.  That comes with no responsibility or consequences at all, right?    As for gay marriage, the word marriage is, by definition, a respectful union between one male and one female.  Also, as long as there are comprehensive domestic partnership  or civil union laws on the books, there is no discrimination for loving gay and lesbians who wish to live as one.

Almost all of the very rich elite are democrats. Democrats make more money on average than Republicans, and Democrats have far more money than Republicans. Why are all the rich snobs you love to hate on TV shows republicans? Because the ultra rich elite democrats own nearly every angle in the entertainment industry, and they feed you full of that crap.    Free market economies provide more for everyone in them. Sure, they increase the amounts between the have, and have nots, but in socialist economies the have nots have much less, though the rich are closer to them in financial numbers ... is that better? For everyone to have less do to governmental interference? I don't see how having less could ever be a step up, but then I don't speak the language of social justice that the socialists do, I find it nonsensical, inane, and warped.    Now, try asking a philosophical question such as this from the other side ... and you will get hate, not tough love, unreasonable group think driven fascist inspired, hate.|`|AA12212403	I believe in the American dream!  If socialism "wins" you, I and our children will lose out on a change to truly prosper and make something of themselves.  That dream of maybe, just maybe, striking it rich and being the next Bill Gates is sucked from you like a deflated baloon.  But, I also believe in paying my FAIR share of taxes, but not having the life-blood sucked out of me.  With conservatism, you have the right to persue your own faith without people being angry and protesting what you do.  With conservatism you are not going to be paying all your hard earned money to support a bunch of people who do not want to work and are lazy.  But, you will also take care of those who truly are in need.  You will feel good about what you do and be proud of what you have earned.  You will not be stuck in a dead-end existence and never have the hope to getting someplace in yourself.  You can make your own decisions.    I'm a Republican Because...     I BELIEVE the strength of our nation lies with the individual and that each persons dignity, freedom, ability and responsibility must be honored.     I BELIEVE in equal rights, equal justice and equal opportunity for all, regardless of race, creed, sex, age or disability.     I BELIEVE free enterprise and encouraging individual initiative have brought this nation opportunity, economic growth and prosperity.     I BELIEVE government must practice fiscal responsibility and allow individuals to keep more of the money they earn.     I BELIEVE the proper role of government is to provide for the people only those critical functions that cannot be performed by individuals or private organizations, and that the best government is that which governs least.     I BELIEVE the most effective, responsible and responsive government is government closest to the people.     I BELIEVE Americans must retain the principles that have made us strong while developing new and innovative ideas to meet the challenges of changing times.     I BELIEVE Americans value and should preserve our national strength and pride while working to extend peace, freedom and human rights throughout the world.     FINALLY, I believe the Republican Party is the best vehicle for translating these ideals into positive and successful principles of government.|`|58EydBwwaa	Guns.

As long as Iraq exists it will be a money sponge sucking up US taxpayer dollars as fast as politicians shove the money over there to crooked contractors, politicians, and general thieves.    If the Iraqis wanted all this they should have done it for themselves, not needing an egomaniac US war-mongering president to do it for them.

The American people will be funding a bunch of pointy-headed academics who won't develop anything economically feasible for years.    Most of the research and development on alternative fuels is being done - full speed ahead - by private industry NOW.  There is NO need for the government to fund a new track for it.

Not wearing a jacket in the White House (how can the world respect he office if he doesn't?)  Eating expensive food and having the heat turned up when he's told us "WE" can't have our SUV's or our thermostats turned up.  Signing the Ledbetter Bill (which means a business can be sued DECADES after an employee retires, if they're getting a pension).  Having Rvrd Lowery give the 'White Do Right" benediction.  Getting ugly with DC about the snow but not even mentioning the people freezing in Kentucky and other states at his weekly address.  (see above about the heat in the WH).  The monster of a stimulous bill which is more crap and little stimulous.  The crooks he's appointing to positions.  His calling for troop withdrawl from Iraq.  Looking weak here and naive' abroad.

Again, not something I think I need to explain.    -Granting his first TV interview as president to Arab networks. Although some may see this as good, because they see it as him trying to build bridges with muslim nations, I see it as him selling out the American people. We have our own problems here in America and America needs attention. I don't give a rats @$$ about what the muslim nations or ANY nation thinks of America. I care about the cost of food going down. I care about being able to afford enough gas in the car to get my husband to and from work.

The policies of the GOP-controlled government from 2001-2007  and the greed on wall street which has created a recession has more to do with it than anything Pelosi has done.    CA's tax revenue has been drying up with high unemployment, decreased productivity, and home foreclosures statewide. None of those things are the fault of Pelosi - they are the fault of wall street and big business, as well as a tied up state legislature that can't pass a budget if their lives depended on it.|`|otYOxmnuaa	I'm from California -- please keep her in D.C.

52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	contract with a minor is worthless.|`|8X1Shdycaa	It is not illegal for a minor to sign a contract, but, as a general rule, contracts signed by unemancipated minors are voidable at the minor's option.    Without knowing the details, it may be that you can get your money back by voiding the contract. However, be aware that if you did receive something in return, the law also provides that one party cannot be unjustly enriched by taking the benefit of a contract and then seeking to void it.    This is not legal advice, but merely information. If the party you contracted with is truly unethical, remember that you may still have problems even if the law is on your side.  It can get expensive enforcing your rights.    www.RedBloodedAmericanGirl.com|`|AA11424005	When a minor signs a contract, the contract is not enforceable.  If you were cheated, you can file suit in small claims court.|`|AA11163314	In general the law states that you are not supposed to be signing contracts.

I recall that JFK ran on a platform of "sure, the economy is good, but it could be better", and the spending frenzy was on.  Can you imagine a candidate saying that now?  And to those who say it is not liberals who call him the messiah, you have a very short memory. But then, what can we expect, when you conveniently forget that it was a black columnist with the L.A.

If it wasn't for FDR, you would be speaking Japanese or German in USA.    Lincoln got to be prez because of a four way split vote.  His poor diplomatic and leadership skills embroiled the USA in a civil war which killed off a huge chunk of the able bodied male population and left half the country in ruins and the US government mired in debt.

A sane person would not shame themselves by trying to tie in President Obama with the Fascist theme of the Vendetta movie.<br>  <br>  Bush, however -- has given us eight long miserable YEARS of Constitution-shredding Executive Orders and Signing Statements and the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act and the legislation of May 9, 2007 and ILLEGALLY spying on Americans in violation of the 4th Amendment and BARRING American citizens from Bush functions UNLESS THEY SIGNED A LOYALTY OATH.<br>  <br>  Parellel to the movie "V for Vendetta."<br>  <br>  Those people mentioning "Obama" in relation to this movie are either stupid or completely brainwashed.

It's amazing how far we've come as a country with the election of President Obama, but with all the "is he or isn't he?" hoopla over his religion I think it will be a very long time before a non-Christian gets elected to the White House. Christians are still the majority in this country and they are extremely threatened by anyone who is different than them. Even Mitt Romney, the Mormon, was questioned, berated, and ridiculed because he is not what is considered to be a mainstream Christian. It sad this country doesn't care what's best for the country, they care how well you fit in their little boxes of what should be! Church and State are supposed to be separate anyway, so why should a candidate's religion really matter? REALLY?    EDIT: Ally 2~ Who are you kidding?

f7KKrMJvaa	Yes    Along with military service|`|AA10928202	No but an IQ over room temp would be nice for voters.|`|oY5ehNXtaa	No.  That would make it even more difficult for low income people to get elected into office. Further, that is supposing that a formal education is always superior to an informal one where someone is dedicated to furthering their knowledge.  I don't believe that is always the case (coming from someone with a formal education). Lastly, if you wanted to do this, you would have to amend the constitution, because it is what lays out the qualifications for public office.|`|2iFFdxQAaa	Absolutely.  The only self-made man who ever amounted to anything was Frankenstein.|`|3wwOcjzSaa	yes. anyone with a college "education" should be banned from running.|`|mPCSbit3aa	No. I'd much rather have a less educated yet honest elected official versus a well educated yet dishonest politician.|`|zeKynoltaa	I don't see "college education" in the Constitution?|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No.|`|xBqAfW62aa	No, it should be a base request but solid experience should be able to  circumvent it on a case by case basis.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	How about dog catcher?|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	No, why would you think that?  Some of the smartest people that I have met did not have a college education.   I think the job should require that they have "character"  I don't know of any that do..|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	No.  Republicans would never stand a chance if that happened.    No, I don't mean a republican could not get a Degree.    What I mean by that is...  Most Conservatives believe that universities train Liberals.  Colleges fill folk's heads with Liberal ideas.    So if College was required there would be less folks on the right.    The rich learned the Conservative idea better serves them.  The poor uneducated are easily persuaded into believing right is not wrong.    No, not a good idea.  Soon everyone would be a Democrat.
70kxSyxhaa	I like the idea of having public service included as part of the high school curriculum, but I would not want to see it become a requirement for adults. Who would monitor something like that?  Other than that, I'm not sure I understand your question. I was born here and am probably guilty of taking my citizenship for granted, but that's probably true of citizens of most countries.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	I don't know to many granite citizens..sounds a bit hard to me. But taking citizenship for granted is our right. Forcing people to partake in public service makes for bad bed fellows and who is to determine who is going to do what? I mean, who determines which group is going to pick up trash and who is going to determine who gets to sit behind a desk answering phones? If some group gets to determine these things then a lot of resentment, even more so than we already have will grow like wild fires.  You can be assured the party in power would almost instantly assign the crappy jobs right off to the opposition party and that goes for both parties.  A case can be made that simply paying sales tax is participating in public service because it contributes to the "better good" of society as a whole.  The mere fact that your post is griping to some extent could put you immediately into the "guest" category if you wanted to slit hairs.  Public service is something people do because they want to do it, not because they are forced into it. Then it becomes a form of basic slavery. No good pal.|`|D4JeNb5xaa	BO has proven his contempt for the Constitution by blocking all requests for full disclosure of his birth certificate, deceased relatives, and college admission papers. We have immigration laws that show the procedure to follow for those desiring US citizenship. Those that subvert the law, giving unlawful citizen status with social benefits are traitors and should be held accountable for their actions.
glt02wg2aa	If the USA could Force the News Media to do honest reporting and disclose ALL the Facts - These Corrupt politicians would never be elected.  Corruption Runs very deep - most of the Super Rich and Wall Street are Democrats and BUY corruption - like Madoff.  Obama was elected by the media that didn't tell us his history, background or voting record.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Obama will do away with us, before he would ever allow doing away with his Corrupt Politicians.|`|UsqG6X6Baa	Yes,I'd say get rid of the politicians we have now and let the American people run the country instead.Similar to American Idol people would use the phone to cast in a vote and choose what laws should pass and which shouldn't.|`|yozsPWPZaa	we have term limits it is called an election.the fkng moron voters do not get it ! a society of sheeples that keep electing the same parasites....|`|7BT7XYeuaa	yes.    max 3 terms for congressmen and max 4 terms for senators.     Also an age limit is necessary so that no one can begin a new term in the house if they are 68 years old or older and no one can begin a new time in the senate if they are 65 years old or older.

wnSIFc0zaa	I hope you read this whole story..it's speaks volumes!!    Joe gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee.   He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water   because some liberal fought for minimum water quality   standards. He takes his daily medication with his first   swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because   some liberal fought to insure their safety and work as advertised.    All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his   employers medical plan because some liberal union workers   fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now   Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast,   bacon and eggs this day. Joes bacon is safe to eat because   some liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.    Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo;   His bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and   the amount of its contents because some liberal fought for   his right to know what he was putting on his body and how   much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a   deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree   hugging liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting   our air. He walks to the subway station for his government  subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in   parking and transportation fees. You see, some liberal fought   for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the   opportunity to be a contributor.    Joe begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay,   medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because   some liberal union members fought and died for these working standards.   Joes employer pays these standards because Joes employer   doesnt want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt   on the job or becomes unemployed hell get a worker compensation   or unemployment check because some liberal didnt think he should   loose his home because of his temporary misfortune.    Its noon time, Joe needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay   some bills. Joes deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC   because some liberal wanted to protect Joes money from unscrupulous   bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression.      Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his   below market federal student loan because some stupid liberal   decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he   was educated and earned more money over his life-time.    Joe is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening   at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive   to dads; his car is among the safest in the world because some   liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home.   He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers   Home Administration because bankers didnt want to make rural loans.   The house didnt have electric until some big government liberal stuck   his nose where it didnt belong and demanded rural electrification.   (Those rural Republicans would still be sitting in the dark)     He is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives   on Social Security and his union pension because some liberal   made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldnt have to.   After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home.  He turns on a radio talk show, the hosts keeps saying that liberals   are bad and conservatives are good. (He doesnt tell Joe that his   beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit   Joe enjoys throughout his day) Joe agrees, We dont need those big   government liberals ruining our lives; after all, Im a self made   man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have.|`|2pWMhDcEaa	Liberals have a social policy.  Conservative social policy is to roll down the window of the limo and yell "get a job!"|`|ClGxicdsaa	Conservatives hate handouts and love hard work.    Liberals detest hard work.

Conservatives can't function without a track record of success.|`|fDuCamMraa	Liberals offer trickle up poverty, Conservative offer trickle down prosperity.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Liberals want conservatives to pay for everything and then they take credit.    Conservatives want liberals to stop playing the victim and carry their own weight.|`|tBXn97NNaa	Liberals advocate equal rights for LGBT people including adoption and marriage.    Conservatives want none of those things.    Conservatives tend to be pro-life.    Liberals also want more safe-sex education and STD awareness, conservatives usually want abstinence-only education.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	liberals want to piss and moan when they don't get their way and have lobbyists doing their bidding.    conservatives sigh at the opposition but build a stronger defense and waste no time pissing and moaning about it.

Conservatives want the rich to be taxed less than the middle class, have education and services that our taxes pay for cut in favor of those corporate and rich tax cuts and have the poor living in the street.  All the while the middle class loses benefits, sees a decrease in wages over time and their healthcare yanked from under them by the corporate insurance companies getting all those GOP tax breaks provided to them by the middle class.|`|2NjUK2kRaa	liberals want to change traditional marriage and make into something its not and murder innocent baby's|`|nMx64x9yaa	Conservatives give tax breaks to the top one percent of society and expect the wealth to just trickle down on everyone else. Liberals give tax breaks to the american workers, thus investing in those who truly shape american capitalism.    Bush came into office and immediatly blew the 350 trillion dollar Clinton Surplus on the biggest trickle down tax break in American history, and our economy has been in the toilet ever since. Proof that trickle down doesn't work.|`|AA10667393	The differences can't be labeled simply. Liberals have different views among themselves on abortion and conservatives differ among themselves on gay marriage. If you limit the discussion to knee-jerks (emphasis on "jerks") of either party, you don't have differences. They both want to make other people do what they think is right.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	Like it makes much real difference in the end,because the demo publicans are really controlled by the same zionists elite. The controlled politicians are allowed to debate endlessly around needless issues such as 'gay marriage',while the real important stuff,such as environmental pollution,the way the american system truly functions;etc is only truly questioned by either left or right wing radicals such as Noam Cromsky, Ron Paul,Ralph Nader,David Duke;etc. If questioning our system like I do makes me radical,then so be it.    Pan-Aryanist,  Third Posionist.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	Liberals usually want things to be equal for all as much as possible. Unless they are so far to the left that they are now on the right. ie: Welfare, housing, prison terms.    Conservatives usually want things saved for them and their "friends". ie: when Rush and Neil Bush's daughter is caught doing drugs its a family matter, but when it is anyone not in their circle they need prison time. Or when it is a fellow conservative help as much as you can, but if they don't think the same as you give nothing or very little.

Like they asked you to build their country. You gave it to them, so stop whining. You took a responsibility when you invaded a country and wanted to install a democracy. Do live up to it.    You leave when its appropriate. I have no idea when that is. Just leave slowly, one at a time. Like when you let go of a child when he's riding a bike. He's going to fall a few times, though before he gets it.    Edit: I agree. I want to see them be independent as well. Note they will never truly be though. The US will always have power and control there. Anyway, my point is its not that easy. When Britain used to make colonies it took 50 years sometimes to get a government running, etc. When you invaded, you left Iraq vulnerable to external threats. IE. Iran. They probably want you out as much as you want out.|`|de50d8fa52217e49871467e36a4ef389aa	Are you kidding me? We dont spend money in Iraq because we're nice and want to help them.

fDuCamMraa	It's time for a divorce and division of property. See the answer on another question for the details. Yahoo won't let me post the link so here is the proposal she articulated.    A Modest Proposal (for a divorce)      Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2009 15:40:08 +0000    Proposal Below:    Dear American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists, Obama supporters, et al:    We have stuck together since the late 1950's, but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has run its course.    Our two ideological sides of America cannot, and will not ever agree on what is right, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile, chalk it up to irreconcilable differences, and go our own way.    Here is a model dissolution agreement: Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that it should be relatively easy!    Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes. We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them. You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU.    Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA, and the military.    You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell (You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move them).    We'll keep the capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street. You can have your beloved homeless, homeboys, hippies, and illegal aliens. We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's, and rednecks.    We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood .    You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.    You can have the peaceniks and war protestors. When our allies or way of life are under assault, we'll provide them job security. We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values..    You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N. But we will no longer be paying the bill. We'll keep the SUVs, pickup trucks, and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Subaru station wagon you can find. You can give everyone healthcare, if you can find any practicing doctors.    We'll continue to believe healthcare is earned and not a right.

Most of the arguments from private citizens are insane, as are most of the arguments in the halls of congress.  But there will always be adversaries on opposing sides of issues of great national interest.  None of that is going to change if we elect any other party into our system.    I constantly hear people talking about kicking out Republicans & Democrats, but with whom are they replaced?  The options on the fringe are out there because they're wackjobs.  Strict Constitutionalists and Socialists being the the most plentiful.    Our government doesn't always make the right decisions, but in large part it does - especially in comparison with other governments.  We're not even 3 months into the first bailout, and we've not even given Obama's team the chance to implement their plans.      Personally, I give his plan a much better chance of success.  What is criticized in his plan is largely minuscule pork that makes up very little of the plan.  The vast majority of the spending that is proposed will be going toward infrastructure, technology, business and community revitalization.      They're not just pissing money away to banks so that it can traverse unchecked through the global banking system.  They're investing in projects that will actually keep money in the US economy, and put it there relatively quick.  Nor are they putting forth huge corporate tax cuts that would most benefit multi-national corporations with no guarantees that we'd see the full benefit to the US economy.    He has a team of highly-skilled, highly-trained and highly-successful economists who know what they're doing.  The consensus among economists is that these people are some of the best available, and the plan they've proposed is solid with programs that will lead to economic strengthening.  I think I'll let them try their hand at this, and certainly trust their opinions over those of some partisan hack pundits and the average pissed off Joe Citizen who hasn't the first clue about macroeconomics.      --------------------------------------...    2nd Amendment rights have nothing to do with the ability to fight a war against our government, and the military build up did not take place to trample on citizen's rights - quite the opposite.  It occured to protect the country from the international military build-up that took place through the technological and economic growth of the Industrial Revolution and beyond.  Had they not done this, we'd possibly be the subjects of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, and our European allies certainly would.  Man, that's some real hardcore trampling of rights they did to us!    And even if there were no control of access to arms (for obvious national security reasons), there isn't an individual on the planet who could match the US in military expenditure.  Not even the most wealthy corporation could accomplish that task.  There isn't even another country who can match us in military expenditure or technology.    There are only about 25 people on the planet who could realistically afford to purchase a Nimitz-Class Aircraft Carrier, fit it with its average 65 planes and their munitions, pay the 3500 crew members it takes to operate it, and pay for all of the operational costs on an ongoing basis.  And that's just ONE.      The US Navy has 10 of them, and not a single individual on the planet has the money to afford that.  And those 10 ships are just a small fraction of the 250+ combat ships in the US Naval Fleet, not to mention the 150+ support ships.  And the US Naval Fleet is just a fraction of the entire arsenal of the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force.    Technological superiority, the size of our arsenal, and highly regulated arms trade protect this country from outside forces.  And for all of the negatives within this country, they pale in comparison to the problems in much of the world.  The freedoms we have as citizens and the unregulated access to wealth and opportunity are far greater in this country than any country on the planet.  And with the very real Nazi and Soviet threats of the 20th Century, we owe our lives as we know them and the continued viability of this country to the US Government, as does all of Europe.    So please tell me how prohibiting access to arms in any way tramples on the rights and freedoms of US citizens?    --------------------------------------...  Civil War?    All of the people in here responding about a pending civil war are morons.  First of all, you're enormously outnumbered on Obama's approval ratings alone.  If you were to ask how many people in the country are ready and willing to fight a civil war against the US Government, I'd be surprised if even 5% were in favor of it and willing to take up arms.    It's not 1861 anymore.  How does anyone think they're going to fight an armed war against the US Government?  Who's going to sell you the automatic weapons, bombs, missiles, body armor, tanks, and fighter jets?  Not any of the US Military weapons contractors, that's for sure.  And as if any foreign contractor in the world is dumb enough to accept the carpet bombing that would come with funding or supplying a revolution against the US Government.    But if by some miracle you were able to secure weaponry from overseas, how do you think you're going to get it into the US?  It would take yet another exponentially more improbable miracle to get shipments of heavy weaponry into the US under the nose of the CIA, FBI and US Military.  So now, if you're able to get over that huge obstacle as well, who do you think you're going to get to operate them?    If you're thinking the military would back you up, you're insane.  The vast majority of US Military personnel would not desert to fight a war against the US Government, knowing full w|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	the time is right for a revolutionary war..|`|t82AcQT1aa	Political Revolution, NO.

Why don't we do some research on these people and protest any corruption we find by NOT voting for them in the mid-term elections next year and in 2012?  Let's start voting based on policies and past behavior, not the rhetoric they dish out to us.    We Americans ARE in control of who sits there in Washington.  We make the ultimate decisions.
SpkWCvupaa	yes and no, because not everyone can afford to buy their music and movies. But, then they're ripping off the people who provide music and movies.

They make so much money for providing entertainment when other workers who work so much more make so little money.|`|58EydBwwaa	I'm all for it.     Firstly, when you purchase a CD, a mere fraction of the sticker price actually goes towards the band/artist.

mB6I5vxbaa	I honestly can't pick one side or another.    I would say no because some people who are 18 19 and 20 are very immature, and would not be responsible with it.

This would ensure that thousands more would die each year from drunk driving, alcohol poisoning and other preventable deaths.  These cost would just be past along to tax payers and motorists.  How many girls had sex with a guy that they regretted because they were drunk?  How many got pregnant also?  This age group is more likely to over drink than any other (don't claim its because its illegal right now), so why would we promote more drinking among this group?  Sorry to be a buzz kill, but over drinker has been a much bigger plague on society than almost anything else.  Lowering the drinking age?  I won't drink to that.|`|iavAv0Ifaa	There shouldnt be an age.  In other countries you can drink when you can reach the counter... they dont have half the abuse that we do in this country.  When you drink til you puke at the age of 8, you learn never to do it again.  And they do.  They learn to limit themselves and not overdue it.  I think there are many 16 year olds in other country that are FAR more mature than many of the 24 year olds in this country.

Regular maintenance of parks, if quality parks are going to exist, is necessary.    I can go on with several others . . . the benefits of college education, the necessity to repair the neglected infrastructure . . . but these things are A) necessary, and B) will get the economy back on track because the Republican plan of cut taxes hasn't worked.

AA11494150	The unit in Flashpoint is a Strategic Response Unit.    SWAT is a term created by former LAPD Chief Darrel Gates. Although the term SWAT remains popular, there are many other forms. The FBI uses "Hostage Rescue Team", or HRT. Our department uses "TWET", Tactical Warrant Entry Team, because that is what we specialize in. There is even one department in my area jokingly refers to themselves as a "Fast Acting Response Team".    Perhaps because Flashpoint is set in Canada, they felt the need to use a more original term than SWAT.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Special Response Unit  In my town they call SWAT HBT Hostage Barricade Team.

liBi332Daa	The entire fear mongering of "Man Made Global Warming" from Al Gore and his minion was only to get people to feel guilty for the degradation of the earth. When in fact the earth shows a natural cycle of heating and cooling as well as our Sun. The founder of the "Weather Channel John Coleman and 30,000 other scientist have a lawsuit against Al Gore due to the insane notion of Global Warming and it being mans fault. When you research the whole Global Warming mania as I have you will discover that the need for man to feel guilt is so when the "Carbon Tax" is passed man will feel obligated in paying this tax. The Carbon Tax will tax individuals and companies on there carbon emissions. Simply put there will be a tax on breathing.

The world is always changing and I hardly think people are to blame for the majority of that change.|`|uKaj1kHfaa	y nose is running like a freight train today! I have to keep a hankie with me like an old man, so I don't care about your petty issues.|`|sTSBk9jhaa	That is all true, but this cold spell is off set by near record high temps in more places than the few regions you have.  If there was no global warming then the amount of record cold would be twice what is currently happening each year.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Gore is in Alaska waiting for Redoubt to blow its top and wondering how he is going to explain how one volcanic eruption puts more crap into the atmosphere than us puny humans ever will.    I am willing to bet that some schmuck will blame volcanic eruptions on the hoax that is global warming.  People are crazy.|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	Of course it's a lie.

So, even when this moron realizes he was wrong he won't admit it, mainly because he's a liberal, but also because of the money.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	you really dont understand climate change do you?    if the gulf stream gets too much freshwater in it (from the polar ice caps melting) northern winters will be bitterly cold. i suggest you actually learn about the subject youre talking about before you make a fool of youself in future|`|IUXriZQJaa	Global warming happens, but it is not because of pollution.  It happens in cycles coinciding with changes in solar activity.  The result is more plant life, which feeds more animals, therefore during the day the animals exhale more CO2, and during the night, reverse photosynthesis generates more CO2, while the plants then change that CO2 into oxygen, which results in healthier and more prolific animals, who fertilize and spread vegetation, which thrives in the warmer climate.     The dominant "greenhouse gas" is water vapor, and we can do nothing to alter that quantity. More methane and CO2 are generated in a day by the oceans than in years of human industry. As someone astutely pointed out, one single volcanic eruption puts more "greenhouse gasses" and ozone-depleting compounds into the stratosphere and upper atmosphere, where they would actually have an effect, than all the thousands of years of human activity combined.    So since it is not about real, human-induced climate change, what is it all about?    Here it is;     M O N E Y    Power    Ideology.    Carbon Credits...    Think about it; Does it make sense that the more polluting third-world countries whose human rights records are worse (but whose bottom-line profitability is better due to exploitation) get the most favorable treatment at Kyoto while those countries which burn more efficiently and are working to fight pollution get the hammer?    I heard an analysis of this siiue which explained a great deal.  Scientists on both sides must compete for a finite amount of funding.  Most of the funding  and networking are provided by the companies and organizations who profit most from hyper-inflated and bombastic claims of human contribution and therefore imply that by researching we can actually fight the process. Some want to be given special ruling authority in light of the straw-man of human-induced global warming. Others are just in it for the money. Scientists who want to do research without predetermined conclusions and without an allegiance to these mega-sources must use their own funds or find an alternative source of funding, and there just aren't any.    The single largest factor is M O N E Y !  Its companion is U.N. corruption and the drive to implement Agenda 21.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Al Gore was born 100 years too late to be a snake oil salesman, so he went into politics instead.

In the past, some have claimed global warming will cause a new ice age.  One person claims we have had 23 years in a row of increased temperatures...with no proof.  Another one claimed man-made global warming will cause more heat in the summer and more cold in the winter.  Go figure.    Trying to tell the kool aid drinkers the truth is like trying to tell muslims Allah was a pedophile.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	The debate is not about whether we are experiencing climate change.  That is a given fact since we know from geological evidence that the earth has had at least 5 ice ages followed by warmer cycles.  The debate is about whether man's activities are causing our climate changes or whether is it merely normal cyclical variations in the earth's climate.    Do I believe that the activities of man alone are responsible for the climate changes?  No.  Could the activities of man be accelerating or intensifying the normal cyclical changes to the earth's climate?  Possibly but I think the effects of man's activities would be at most minimal.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	It's more of an exaggeration than a lie.  Pumping fossil fuels and whatnot into the atmosphere is having a negative impact on the planet (influences on weather, increasing the rate of extinction, melting arctic ice, and so on), but it's not the "we'll all be dead in 30 years!" scenario that many are making it out to be.  "Global warming" is a bit of a misnomer anyway, since the potential long-term consequences have more to do with massive flooding and extreme weather patterns than an overall raise in worldwide temperature.    Long story short, I am skeptical about a lot of it, but I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet.  It's a bit difficult to ignore the drastic increase in the rate at which arctic ice is melting, which has coincided with the increase in the use of fossil fuels.  If you wade through all of the propaganda, you'll discover that there is some truth to all of it.  In other words, don't listen to politicians, find out what actual scientists have to say about the subject.  There's a pretty big difference between Al Gore "the world is doomed!" global warming, and the actual facts.|`|t82AcQT1aa	The Gore crowd is why people better ammo up, before it's too late.|`|v1a0PHdwaa	Since it's quite obvious from your post you know zilch about science and Climate Change maybe you should just post about things you know  Inbreeding etc|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Global Warming may be a concept that is too complicated to be understood by the Rush's of this world who see everything through the dollar signs obscuring their rose shaded glasses. Climate change would be more accurate; melting ice (already proven) and the severity of storm fronts, etc. Maybe in 20 or 50 years the ocean currents may change creating a new ice age? Its' too complicated to model entirely with even the most sophisticated computer but then who would want to take a chance particularly since most climatologists agree that we are already undergoing not so subtle changes that seem to be a result of man's use of carbon dioxide creating, fossil fuels. To understand it one must first remove the dollar signs from ones eyes as, yes, it may be quite costly to reverse or merely arrest but the alternative is far worse for our children and theirs. Wouldn't it be stupid to waste the planet while Exxon is the most profitable company in the world? That said 2012 may be the height of solar flares which will render nearly all electronic communications useless as it did the telegraph wires in the 1800's, in which case it may be academic in the short run.|`|AA12212403	Gore is a multi millionaire and he has produced a film, sold many books and gets paid a fortune to make public appearances.  The entertainment industry just adores him.  Need I say more about why this continues?    Regardless of Gore, I do think we need to be environmentally responsible people.  I think we should recycle and reduce emissions and protect our planet.  I am not stupid, but I think the amount of money this man has made off of this is near obscene.  I also think some people are going way overboard.  I also think that we should not be forced by the government to do things.  I think tax credits when you buy hybrid cards or do energy saving improvements are great ideas, though.  But, make no mistake, we do need to clean up our earth for the sake of my children, and yours and the future.|`|fDuCamMraa	They want to control the world. It has nothing to do with the environment.

Because Gore is part owner of a carbon credits company. All he is waiting for is the government to force private companies to buy carbon credits, and he and his company steps into the breech and starts selling them. He stands to make hundreds of millions every year or even BILLIONS from this scam. So he whips up the crowds to a hysteria about global warming in the hopes that those crowds will then go to their senators and congressmen to demand that the government start forcing businesses to buy carbon credits.|`|wnSIFc0zaa	I guess you don't understand Global Warming affects the CLIMATE!!

Global warming is part of the overall condition referred to as "global climate change," which is not CAUSED by, but is EXACERBATED by, things humans do.    Like it or not, it's true.  Every time I hear one of you neocons claiming that humans have no impact on the environment, it makes me understand why Democrats have taken control of our government.

I despair.|`|r86wXV1Waa	Aye laddie  you cannae protect or aid anyone else until you can take care of your self. no one wull look after us we must do it ourself.    nae a nation is going to care what happens to us. they are looking to there own problems while seeing how they can take advantage of what or who they can in order to survive.  British jobs for British workers first is as it should be.    you are correct in your assessment. of the facts. i have been saying this for years now. all the bad plans and management of this labour govt  are coming out to be seen     Lord Meddlesome Mandelson is a wee bit of a pratt Eurocrat who only cares for his position    brown has failed us and the EU is pushing his bad management to achieve their own goals|`|oY5ehNXtaa	This thinking is going to be a major factor in Great Britain's decline!  Protectionist have never given people anything other than poverty and misery.  Go ask Iran how protectionism is doing right now?  They believe that they should make everything they use.  Much of their people live in abject poverty.      Since the advance of international trade after WWII, we have since huge increases in middle class wealth.  When banks are profitable (or any other company), that is good for everyone who has a retirement account or any other investments.  You said it means fewer jobs, but the facts are the exact opposite.  Look at unemployment rates over the last fifty years, especially in America, they are at historic lows (despite the economic meltdown), despite what are the doomsday people said would happen.  There is no net job loss, rather some are lost and others are gained.      How can life be better if you make everything in house, but other countries can make it and sell it to you for cheaper?  You don't.  You just pay more for most things and that means a lower standard of living for all.  The problem is not enough people in this world think like a capitalist.  Too many think like a socialist while living in a capitalist system... doesn't work.|`|NnY1wG11aa	What-ever ordinary people say and think this government like you said only listens to the few.    If you are a worker on a low income you may as well be invisible.  But if you are a sleazy Labour political then people want and need your services.  But if you are a greedy banker then government comes a knocking on your door.    Labour - Conservative, Conservative - Labour, does it really matter anymore if you are poor and on a low income.  NO, as they are all the same now

But after saying that I won't be voting for them as the BNP don't believe in free speech and would also deport people who's families have lived here for generations, their two main stumbling blocks, other than that I would vote for them.    And if anyone wants to complains about the BNP doing well in the next election, blame the politicians, don't blame ordinary people they only respond to people who they think will help and listen to em.    The people to blame are this present shower of political cr@p for allowing Britain to become the dumping ground for the rest of the world at the expense of ordinary working class Brits who they also see as fair game to call and malign at every opportunity.    This present fiasco of Italian and Portuguese workers being given preference over British workers is a prime example of what I mean.    What do they expect from ordinary people who have had enough of being dumped-on.|`|GbiFRG5eaa	No, because their political history is mired in racism, whether that is "fact" or political propaganda is open to debate.   There is another party that seeks to do it's best for the country without the racial elements and that is UKIP.   Aside from "asylum seekers" and illegal immigrants, I consider all who live in and work for my country as British..  When GB said "British jobs for British people" he omitted to tell us that his beloved EU, the one that he has sold us all off to, could employ EU workers for less money.  We are all equal now, would one fight against ones former enemies now that we are a "brotherhood" .  Remember people, the whole raison detre is, there is NO Britain, we are all europeans, part of a one nation state.  If your boss wants to hire the French or the Poles, who are you to object?  Are you a racist, a xenophobe?   Perish the thought that you might just be a fellow European, are the French/Poles not Caucasians?   The citizenry of the world is being blinded by "racism" it has become the common enemy, one which is being used against the electorate to silence opposition.   Where one dares not speak it's name, you will create subservience and obedience, that which we strongly question, will be used as a weapon to suppress us.  Race and religion have long been used as weapons to keep the "common man" in thrall, we do it till this day,.our rulers bank upon it.  It is the will of the masses "they" fear, only by creating division and unrest between us can they keep control.   The BNP is therefore a "tool" of government, hence why they are not "allowed" to participate in open debate, their followers are denounced as "subversive" racist agitators.   Those who rule us need an "enemy" to convince us that "they" have our best interests at heart, the BNP do a magnificent job here.   Commonly known as not being able to see the wood for the trees, or conversely, blinding the ignorant with science.  Either way, government 3 voters 0.   Forget the radical vote, it is a squeak in the wilderness, the main parties have way too much money and influence.   Go "Independent" and make the difference.   Thank you for your indulgence, but I fear it might be too late.|`|OIDejLJXaa	I won't be voting for the BNP.    I don't support policies based on race-hate, which put a person's skin colour before his abilities.    I don't support violence being used as a political tool.    So I won't vote BNP.    Those who vote BNP are either supporters of racism and violence, or too stupid or disillusioned to see what the BNP really are. The article from the Times might help those who are undecided.|`|2ab686f19f6ca470d996180cb7fd6ecdaa	You are expressing a view that the average citizen of this country is thinking, a commonsense approach to clearing up the mess that mainstream politics has thrust upon us, especially New Labour. Years of unbelievably bad management resulting in an ethnically cleansed society with cities like Leicester supporting fifty per-cent immigrant stock. A City with 50% non native British is a city that is gradually being taken over by foreigners. Unfortunately, the ethnic cleansing of Leicester is a national trend and totally unacceptable.    It has taken a recession for the British people to wake up to the fact that British Jobs are being farmed out to foreigners and the recent strikes is the response of normally over tolerant people.    The BNP are our only hope, if we want to stay a nation then we must fight for that right, mainstream politics do nothing for our people and only serve to push forward ideological ideas of suspect mainstream politicians like the Dictator and Cameron.    The BNP have no chance of a majority in parliament but have a great chance to pick up 50 to 60 New MP's in the next parliament if they put up at every polling station. I hope they do.

All the decent people who wouldn't normally vote will turn out in droves to see that you don't get into power.    The BNP is a single issue pressure group focused only on race.

Nick Griffin has shown his true colours more than one and they are Nazi black, white and red.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	No, I would never vote for a neo-nazi racist party.    Economic crisis is threatening the jobs and living standards of every worker. Last week giant multinationals announced 76,000 job losses across the US, Britain and Europe. The world is in the deepest crisis since the 1930s with spreading mass unemployment, pay cuts and poverty.  This government, which has so utterly failed working people, showers billions on the bankers to shore up the profit system. But workers are ordered to the dole queue. As a steel worker at Corus said last week, If youve got a bowler hat you get billions, if youre in a hard hat you get turned away.     We need a fightback, with strikes and protests. But these strikes are based around the wrong slogans and target the wrong people. Its right to fight for jobs and against wage-cutting. Its right to take on the poisonous system of sub-contracting that is used to make workers compete against each other. Its right to demand that everyone is paid the proper rate for the job and that theres no undercutting of national agreements. And we need militant action, including unofficial action, to win these demands. But these strikes are not doing that  whatever some of those involved believe. It simply lets the bosses off the hook and it threatens murderous division at a time when we need unity in action to fight back.     Its not Italians or Poles or Portuguese workers who are to blame for the attacks on British workers conditions.  Construction workers have always been forced to move far from home for jobs, whether inside a country or between countries. How many British workers (or their fathers or brothers) have been forced to work abroad from Dubai to Dusseldorf? When workers are divided its the bosses who gain. Total Oil, who manage the Immingham refinery, make 5 billion every three months! Jacobs, the main contractor which has then sub-contracted to an Italian firm, made 250 million in 2007. These are the people workers should be hitting, not turning on one another. Already the racist BNP are pumping out racist propaganda supporting the strikes.    Everyone should ask themselves why Tory papers like the Express and the Sun and Mail  which hate union power and urge on privatisation  are sympathetic to the strikes.    Instead of blaming foreign workers we should be organising in a united way to pressure the union leaders to fight. And if the union leaders wont fight then workers will have to organise the resistance themselves.      Workers across Europe are under attack. Out unions should learn from the general strikes in Greece and France that we need mass, militant action directed at the bosses and the government to win.|`|aJWjqaAPaa	Not really  Having British in your Party's Name doesn't actually get My vote    As for them Being Racist they are about as Racist as the Conservatives are|`|ERVib5gYaa	I'm not racist so I would never support or vote for them.The BNP will NEVER win a general election..

nMYxyrzraa	Umm usually signatures are digitally checked in top banks these days, I do not know the verification process for DBS. The story also shows a time history lapse and understandably some missing details. If you usually have a discrepancy with a Bank its always best to raise it as soon as possible. Depending on clause and classification there is always a fixed period /time limit to raise a claim. This should have been done much earlier , but under the exceptional circumstances they might consider it , its just surprising you had not taken any action before. If you have, just make sure to keep records of your documents and letters. Either way the transaction should have been reversed when or if you advised them. if you have not already done so contact the bank in writing stating the facts, but be prepared, due to the time lapse it could a legal technicality. I would recommend you also contact the Financial Ombudsman Service and read the Banking Ombudsman Scheme sections.  http://www.dbs.com.sg/in/products/servic...    Edit:  Yes if its a litigation case then the file should still be open, but you still need to safeguard your position. Banks have to make provisions for losses and it will require a write off and statutory approval.  For some Banks the procedure may vary as regards misappropriation, this may either be handled internally by their audit and control section or through Banks solicitors, but either way they should have informed you already if the police had contacted them. I would arrange a meeting with your account/relationship or branch manager and explain the matter at your earliest available convenience|`|AosW4IvHaa	I think you can.

We presently have a sizable contingent of Guardians in the Persian Gulf.  We also have folks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.    And please don't forget that our job starts when conditions get bad and everybody else goes someplace to hide and be safe.  That's when WE go to work!|`|ZL1KJqRaaa	Every branch has pros and cons.

Obama talks a good game, but he always leaves a loop hole to allow him to do something else.  Example: he wants to balance the budget and reduce the deficit.  Great, I agree.  And yet, at the same time, he signs record-level spending bills.  Now what?  Here's what he doesn't say:  huge taxes.  Okay, he just wants to tax corporations and the rich.  Sounds nice, but corporations don't pay taxes, ever.  They just transfer that tax bill to their consumers (translation:  us).  So now we pay more taxes.  I'm not too happy about that.<br>  <br>  Another reason I vote Negative:  I was way to distracted with the Bouncing Pelosi in the background.

DXXpHKupaa	In your additional details, you actually showed an issue that most do not think about.    Personally, I think Abortion is an abomination, but I see no logical alternative in some situations-that's why I'm Pro Choice.    The right are vehemently Pro-Life and for lower taxes.  However, this creates a dilemma.    If Abortion were outlawed, and those babies that could not be taken care of are now increasing in rapid numbers-how will we be able to feed them?  By increasing welfare taxes.  How will we make sure they are educated and clothed?  Increased taxes.  In other words, as much as they feared Socialism, it's going to be necessary if they outlaw things like Abortion.    I'm not trying to be heartless if I appear that way, I'm trying to think logically for what is best for everyone.  If I decided it was prudent to support overturning Roe vs. Wade, I'd do what I must and also support an increase in Welfare taxes.      Anything else would be truly heartless.|`|47c479f2304b0788f9cb6367693718d5aa	You voted on delusion.  Like most of America you don't know what you want.  Consider your comment on education.  There is no education in the US.  This forum demonstrates just how poor the education standards of America are.  There is no education, just social engineering in schools.  The problem is that social engineering has not worked because no matter how hard the Progressives try, they can not keep people from thinking.   Although your ability to rationalize your opinion may prove to be the exception to my statement.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Nothing like Omniscience.

Check into it, giving them more money won't make the schools any better.  As for the rest of your rant, you have no clue.  Do you have children?  Guess what, they were fetuses at some point in their life.  Would you allow someone to kill your children? Yea, I didn't think so, but I guess they are only children if they are wanted.  In that case, we shouldn't prosecute people who kill their born children either because they obviously didn't want them anymore, else they wouldn't have killed them.  You can do stem cell research with cord blood and adult stem cells.  You don't need to kill babies for it.|`|boRpd2HDaa	Well friend, your argument is filled with all kinds of errors in logic. First of all,   1. Killing a fetus does not save the mothers life except in some extreme cases that at best make up about 1% of abortion cases.  2. The war is ending anyways, regardless of what Obama is going to do. In case you haven't heard, we won. Troop deaths are down, civilian deaths are down, IED attacks are down, and just recently there was an election held in Iraq and NO attacks, I repeat, NO attacks were made during the election  3. Universal health care is a scam. If you think it works so well, ask someone that lives in Canada or the UK how much they love waiting 6 months for an operation. In fact, once funding begins to slow down because of the increased burden on the medical establishment they will begin to regulate services (e.g. "I'm sorry, you are past the cuttoff age for this operation. Sucks to be you grandpa")  4. Statistics have shown that states that regularly use the death penalty have lower rates of crime. If you are asking what is the difference between the death penalty and abortion that has pro-lifers so upset but yet appears to be contradictory, I will explain. The difference between an unborn fetus and a murderer is guilt. The fetus has done nothing wrong. The murder gave up his right to life when he took someone else's.  5. I will give you this one because we definitely need more cops on the street.   6. Again, research has shown that more funding does not produce more educated students. Look at the 10 Billion dollars that the Kansas City school system received. They built an acquarium, and olympic size pool and brand new classrooms and yet the scores remained the same. If you want better educated students, then punish parents who refuse to feed their children nutritional food, send their kids to bed on time, discipline their kids, ensure their children do their homework, ensure their children limit their amount of entertainment, and spend time with their children.    So to answer your question, NO YOU ARE NOT PRO LIFE! You think with your heart and not with your head where reason and logic come from.

Kh4p4gPXaa	Sure you can sue.   Can you win?  That's the question.    Why did you quit?   Were you in any way wronged or harmed by the hiring of "illegals"?

Any person can sue any other person - natural or artificial - for any reason.  I think your question can be "Will I win?"    You can win if you demonstrate that the action or inaction of others damaged you or caused you a loss that you can quantify.    How did the hiring practices of your former employer cause you damage or loss?  Your decision to quit may have caused your loss, but how did the employer's actions require you to quit?    What is your loss?    Discuss these questions with your attorney.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	As the Social Security Administration knows of the situation it is not your business to do anything about it and if you quit rather than got fired you took the step to leave the employment voluntarily so immigration did not cost you the job.

You cannot sue a company because you have a personal problem with them. You can keep fighting to get the illegals deported though. If the SSA doesn't care what you have to say, then maybe you just need to move on and get another job.
BPuyPpNkaa	Situations like this could take months for approval because it has to go before a panel of judges who will weigh the issues and the severity of the crime before they can make a decision on your case.  Most committees of this sort only meet about once a month.  Once approved or disapproved, the chain of command passes the decision back to the person who delivers the judges decisions to you.  Depending on the size of the chain of delivery, could be a couple of days, could be a couple of weeks.  If the judges are unable to make a decision they may want you to meet with them so that further questioning and evaluation on your case can be made once any unclear questions are answered.  Again, this probably will depend on the severity of your crime and the outcome of your "payment of debt to society".  It probably wouldn't hurt to keep in touch with your recruiter about once a week if you don't hear back from him.  This will help give you some piece of mind and also look good on your part in showing them how serious you are about becoming a new army recruit.  Good luck!|`|wJhZbUKtaa	Normal.

The dollars spent on the non-stimulus and pork barrel payback in the current bill will actually hurt the economy.  I thought the new President was all against pork barrel spending and earmarks and going to have none of it and especially none in this emergency bill; does that mean he is going to veto it when/if it passes or sign it because "he has to in order to save the country".  Don;t say he is going to veto the pork because he cannot do that as a line item veto is not legal so it is all or nothing.

If any of you are not angry at that then I worry for you.  I fear for our future because Washington is filled with lobbyists and special interests groups.  They outnumber the politicians 2:1.  That is ridiculous.  There are more lobbyists than politicians.  When the media tells you they spend billions lobbying, what does that mean to you.  Where is that going?  They aren't say that.  It doesn't take rocket science.  I saw a stat that showed AIG paying 400 million in bonuses to a total of 100 people.  The average is 1 million per person.  Now, let us use common sense.  Nothing is spread out so a large chunk went to the top.  None of this is difficult to understand.  The economy we are in is a result in corporate America doing all it could to earn the mighty dollar...which isn't so mighty right now.  Both sides and both parties have caused this.  We don't need Free Trade, we need Fair Trade.  Remember, nothing in life is free.  That trade costs someone and that someone is the American middle class.  We lost jobs!  Profits soared but not jobs.  Our manufacturing is steadily declining.  I remember when you could by an American TV and I am in my 30's.  Now, its just Japan running the show.

Investing just about all of the company's profits into new production equipment and machines.    The reason he did this?  Because he stood to make more money by re-investing the profits in the company because of the preferential tax rate on capital gains vs. income tax.

The laws and regulations are becoming much more restrictive and various levels of government are trying to tax it heavily to reduce the numbers of smokers.

But, the tobacco industry has a huge hold on our country and there are tons of smokers who would freak out.

9gsm05lnaa	No, it would take a few court hearing to ask for a new trial. Then a judge would hear the new evidence and make a decision on what to do. The district attorneys office has to say that they do not want to pursue another trial against the first man. All of this usually takes about another 2 months.    That's if the first man had been convicted and sent to prison. If the first man is in county jail without having been convicted, then the DA can drop charges in the interest of justice the next day and the first man will be let go right away.|`|f1dce99b8faff5b2c67489afa10cdeceaa	not then and there but he will be released. the court would have to drop the charges on wrongful conviction. Then they reopen the case and start over, and it depends on the innocent person if he wants to press charges towards the state.|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	No.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	after a brief investigation, more often than not he will be released...|`|Gxv4SX5taa	Yes, the man would be released immediately upon the arrest of the actual culprit if there is substantial evidence.|`|8hAhmlJjaa	Not right then and there.  There are channels that need to be followed in order to obtain the release.  It normally takes about 3 working days.  When the person is released he is offered a settlement from the state for the amount of time he spent in prison.  Most take this in order to start a new life.  Every once in a while one tries to sue for more money, but I have never heard of one winning that suit.  There are provisions in the state laws to handle wrongful imprisonings.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	not then and there,  but the case would be re-opened and the charges dropped.    The wrongfully accused could then sue for damages.   Its happened more than once in history.

f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	You cannot lock a tenant out for non-payment of rent. The landlord would have to go through a formal eviction process.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	Consult an attorney immediately.    Your landlord has your grandmother on the lease.  If the rent payments are not made timely, and the sublease is unclear or unhelpful, the landlord has a right to evict HER "and other occupants".    Nonpayment of cable and utilities in your grandmother's name may be her debts.|`|1HLPznZhaa	I wouldn't change the locks.. you could end up in court paying three times the rent..  1. Did your grandmother leave you in charge of collecting from her tenant ? Hopefully in writing..  2. Write a letter to the tenant advising they have 30 days from the date of your letter to bring the account current including cable and utilities..I would cc the land lord..Send all correspondence certified mail signature return requested..  4. If you are ignored start eviction proceedings..  5 . This could be  sticky unless your grandmother left you in charge..  6. If I were you I would get a legal opinion to protect you and your grandmother...  Good luck|`|fT365jd5aa	I don't know what state you live in, but generally you cannot just change the locks on someone, even for non-payment of rent.  You have to go through a formal eviction process to get that tenant out.  The landlord or your grandmother should file to evict the tenant.  If you don't undergo the right proceedings and change the locks without eviction, the subtenant may be able to get a money from your grandmother or the landlord in the form of a fine for improper eviction (depending on the state),    I suggest before you do anything, you talk with a housing attorney. Most states have free clinics, either though the local courts or nonprofits to assist you.

They do have tons of military weapons, which the US gave to them to fight off the soviet union, just no weapons of mass destruction. However, Saddam Hussein did want other countries to think that Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction because he ruled by extreme fear and violence, killing anyone, even his so called allies, but it was obviously false that he had WMDs. Supposedly Iraq did have some chemical weapons before, maybe around the time of the first Bush. But it has been said that even then (If I am correct) Iraq had no such weapons. It was just a way for the US to go into a war with iraq because of it's massive oil quantity. Saddam was even falsely blamed for the attack of 9/11 for the same reason. It's massive oil wealth.|`|6fbeb6fa83108b27e19a313b4f6d6378aa	The American people, particularly those parents who lost their dear children in the senseless war, should force ex-President Bush to give this answer.

Indeed, they should go further to find out how much dollars of  the taxpayers have been expended to prosecute the war in order to locate the weapons and what remains in the American economy.

Both sides have been stampeded into a destruction of civil liberties, with terrorism being used as the scarecrow to huddle them together.    Most have been fed a diet of media crap, put out by a total of around 5 media corporations, the end product of an orgy of media mergers and acquisitions, leaving a smaller and smaller pool of actual content providers, allowing smaller and smaller groups to decide what to spoon feed Americans as part of the infotainment propaganda system.    The real fun part is watching history being re-written right in front of my eyes. When i went to school in the 70's, we had out of date textbooks from the 50's, what we were taught in class didn't match what was in the texts from the 50's, and what kids are taught today doesn't match what was in the texts from the 50's, or what I was taught in the 70's.    ---------------edit    The right to vote will never disappear, it will be the security blanket to keep people happy, what will disappear is the relevance of who gets voted on...the real decisions will be made behind the scenes, with the person in office irrelevant, just voting exactly how they are told to vote. They will just be the targets for us to throw tomatoes at, and get impassioned about, while the real work goes on, unnoticed, unopposed, and unaccountable behind a curtain of obscurity.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	Um....yes.  We call it "voting" here in America.|`|wFmL5tWEaa	Yes, I have no doubt about that at all.

e19ukSO0aa	Of course it does, that's what the US economy is based on. But there needs to be proper regulation and social safety nets to ensure that the natural progression of capitalism is kept in balance - that being, if unabided capitalism was allowed to take place, very shortly you would find all of the wealth concentrated in the hands of very few, with the vast majority of the rest of the people living in poverty, if not dying of starvation.    Pure socialism doesn't work either. There needs to be a proper mixture of both- which is what most successful countries do - including the US, but not to the extent that many western European countries have done.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Capitalism works because it promotes economic growth but it needs sufficient oversight and regulation.  We have experienced the results of abuses in the past but some ideologues refuse to recognize reality and live in some fantasized idealistic delusion.      These ideologues go on and on about the free market and getting government off the back of business as if the whole past history of capitalism had never existed. In a modern complex interrelated society the negligence and wrongdoing and greed of various businesses can bring down the entire society. The government can provide the watchful eye but the will has to be there and we can't get distracted again by individuals who have only the protection of certain privileged entities in mind.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	It's not the theory, it's a fact. If you can look at the US today, and show me a non capitalist country doing better in the world, then do it ... but you can't. All you can do is compare the US at it's best to the US at it's worst, which is better than any other country but a few, and all those are capitalist, and it's only 1 I can think of, which is Hong Kong, which is of course an excellent example of a free market economy.    I'm sorry, you are not very well informed, and your level of objective perspective could take place in a shoe box. Name some examples of the glories of socialism, or whatever you are talking about, and how Obama is working for that.    Obama just put out a so called stimulus bill which does nothing in tax cuts but pay off the super rich elite for supporting him, the richest, the democrat money base, the billionaires who control the media and entertainment industry. It tosses some crumbs to infrastructure, about 30 billion out of close to 900 billion, and nothing in the rest of his pig of a bill does much to generate stimulus at all.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Yes, of course.

The same thing is going on on wall street. It is not the legitimate markets that are cratering, it is the Brokers and bankers are losing their azzes in the "off the books" derivative markets and it is collapsing the real economy because they have to cover it with investors money.

In 1995, Clinton signed legislation that, Robert Rubin, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, under President Clinton, explained that this was in line with President Clinton's strategy to "deal with the problems of the inner city and distressed rural communities"    And in 1999 which repealed the part of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services, this was the beginning of the end of our free market system, no Obama will push us the rest of the way and into the one world order the imagine.|`|8ioQ3Gtuaa	To tell you what I believe is this.  I didn't;t like any of the running candidates, completely because of what they believed and wanted.  I didn't like McCain, because he believed in global warming and he wouldn't have made much of a difference in the economy and what such.  He belived many things that I don't Believe should be put in action here in the U.S.  I didn't like Obama, because he wants to change our system of government to socialism.  He even states it in his speaches.  Obama should realize that socialism has NEVER EVER worked in ny county, city, state or whatever people like to say they live in.  Obama wants to raise the taxes on the rich.  That is good until the ceo's who hare getting taxed even more think they aren't gettuing enoguh money to live off of.  So they cut people's job's so they get more.  Then the government uses our tax money the people who have no job.  That is good, but the people who are lazy and have no job are getting an income for doing nothing and decide to not go back to work.  That isn't all people, but some.  The government uses to much money to keep dying business's alive when we should just let the business's die.  People will lose thier job's but opeople will grow the entraponewer spirit and will make a business that the people want.  Everybody is saying that the sales on stuff are going down and we are going into a "depression".  But it is supply and demand.  Stores don't have that much, because everybody is buying so they raise prices.  People stop buying until prices lower.  Then the places will get more of the demanded items and lower the cost  so they can sell the items.  The amount will lower and they will raise prices.  It happens naturally, but won't happen overnight.  If the government will just but out and let the economy and whatnot do what it does, then we would be in a better state of life. (I stopped talking about the 2 canidates a while ago).            P.s.- I believe that global warming isn't real.|`|OLCoFKQraa	Yes, I still believe that Capitalism is the best economic system, the problem here is not Capitalism, it's government interference in the private sector combined with the inflationary fractional reserve banking system.    The government created regulations and incentives for financial institutions to give home loans to poor people with bad credit that simply could not afford the repayments, a free market system would do no such thing, so in this case, the "watchful eye" was the "meddlesome eye" that forced people to make bad financial decisions.    The other problem like I said is fractional reserve banking, the US now has a system of legalized fraud where banks are allowed to lend money they don't have and keep reserves at close to 1% of deposits, no one in their right mind can possibly think that would work, so once again, I still believe Capitalism is the best economic system, but you need less government interference in the free market as far as supply and demand, you need a heavily policed financial/corporate system to catch people who are committing fraud, and you need a much higher reserve ratio.|`|6e6fb50d87f07492879715e4526ac64daa	i look at it like this.    compare how many people are trying to get into the US to how many are trying to escape.     then compare how many people are trying to get into russia, china, cuba, or the eastern bloc as to how many are trying to escape.     and presto, you have your answer.|`|JhAghqiAaa	Yes, capitalism works for the rich and the powerful.

Capitalism works very well for its purposes- Social Darwinism. Many people would actively claim that this is a fantastically moral stance- its just so damn fair.

The fact is that Obama is a socialist (thank darwin) and he ran on a socialist platform, and we voted him in because we are done with the primitive tribalism of anarcho-capitalism. We are ready to join the 20th century. In a few years we might even join the 21st.|`|RF6viXwgaa	Capitalism works.    The system has gotten worst the more regulated it has become.      Consider a basic example:  You don't hire ugly waitresses.  I, an ugly waitress, sue for discrimination.  Under pure capitalism, you would be free to do whatever you want. So you continue to hire hot waitresses and you are successful.   Under a system of regulation, the court, with good intentions, forces you to hire ugly waitresses, your business slows down, and you lay off everyone.    Under capitalism, the ugly waitresses could take their money and open their own business, but they would rather have the courts force you to risk your money.    What's happening now is akin to forcing the business to hire the ugly waitresses, then blaming capitalism, which is not the problem. On top of that, the answer being proposed is more ugly waitress regulations.|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	It has up until greed over took the morals and ethics out of the businesses.

gasquENMaa	Hello Dan. This is a rough call for anyone to make. Given all the circumstances as you state, I would think the move might possibly be your best choice. Anger management classes would be an absolute top priority regardless of where you go or which course of action you decide upon.<br>  <br>  The reason I think the move might be best is that you would be changing your total environment. You won't have a "record" with the police looking at everything you do or say. You would be changing the circle of "friends" you now have, which may or may not have an influence on the anger management issues. Having strict guardians watching and guiding will be a major plus at this point.<br>  <br>  For whatever it is worth to you, if you cannot get the anger management situation under definite control VERY soon, you will starting on a very short journey to prison ( it won't be juvy, but the big time the moment you turn 18 and are considered an adult).<br>  <br>  I can tell you first hand that I have seen literally hundreds of young men go through my prison with different levels of anger management problems. Once behind the wire, it is a closed environment and we do NOT tolerate issues like this. You will spend 24/7 taking orders in every single facet of your daily life. We tell you what to do and when. If anger management surfaces, we legally deal with it at your own level. Trust me when I say anything you can do now to prevent this would be to your benefit.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|OiAl6w48aa	A change of scenery might do you good.  You're obviously going to keep getting in trouble if you stay where you are.  A strict household might be just what you need.|`|kmGW34unaa	ahh ***** is dat you da freash prince|`|hw8jOWaeaa	I'd leave and try a fresh start some place else, it could be good for you in the long run.|`|f7bc20a0e0f7672dd80798d522d8fbc2aa	Do the math.  You're 17 and looking at 6 months time.  You probably won't get that though if they're using 30 hours community service type language.  I'm guessing a misdemeanor?  Even a misdemeanor juvenile record can mess up your chances of working for the government, FBI, CIA, etc.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you'll be 18 in less than a year, then you can do what you want.  Go to college, get a job, join the peace corps, whatever.  One year going to private school is probably a damn good thing.  If you really are looking at a felony with 6 months time, we're talking an exchange of 6 months inside vs. one year outside with supervision.  It shouldn't even be a question.  Move.
AA10118655	He may be able to get you an earlier ship date if you don't want a guaranteed rating. He probably would be more than happy to have you ship out earlier. But, the ship date you have is based on when they have an available slot in the A School you will be going to.<br>  <br>  So if you want to be non-designated (no rating, like a deck ape scraping paint all day), just tell him you want to ship earlier and change your contract to get out of your guaranteed A School. Some people enjoy being non-designated, and strike later after they get to the fleet.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* - If an opening does come up for your A School, he may be able to get you an earlier ship date. That happened to me. I was scheduled to go to Great Lakes in April, but got a call in early February (on a Thursday) saying I could leave on Monday, and they said everything would be staying the same. That was a lie: I went to Orlando instead of Great Lakes (OK, it was a GOOD lie - I didn't feel to happy about boot camp in Great Lakes in February!)|`|AA10709853	HE CANNOT MAKE A SLOT APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR.  if you walk in making ultimatums like he will be more likely to say" fine.. see ya.

I guess you could tell him that the Aug. date is not good for you...There is not much he can do about it.<br>  <br>  Just know this:<br>  Many of the jobs in the Navy have schools and sometimes those schools are hard to get. Many of the schools are competitive and you have to have good scores on an ASVB to get in.<br>  <br>  You could leave right away as an designated seaman. If you want to spend the next two years just doing what ever the heck someone tell you. You could try to get the same school later, but it is sometimes harder to strike for a rate.<br>  <br>  You could see about changing jobs. Maybe something else will leave sooner.<br>  <br>  Or you can wait it out and study Navy history, Chain of Command, General Orders and Rates/ranks so you can be a little ahead in boot camp.<br>  <br>  Honestly a recruiter doesn't get to determine your ship out date. They have the counselors at MEPS who do that. The recruiter just submits paperwork.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that you can't get what you want right now. It doesn't happen fast in the military. If you don't like waiting it out, then maybe the Navy isn't for you.|`|Pa3HVXQZaa	Since you are shipping out in August why would you threaten not to go if you want to leave sooner?  I'm a navy recruiter in Cleveland Ohio and tell your recruiter to submit you a Dep Action Request "DAR" to get you out sooner.  If a job opens up you can get it.  Ask to see it as well next time you go to his office.  Its quite easy.<br>  <br>  And, recruiters don't get any bonus for anyone joining the navy.  That is a myth.  Only reserve Army and reserve National Guard (non recruiters) get a bonus per recruit.  I don't know where anyone came up with that bull.  If that were the case I'd be rich|`|au0ssSnvaa	The Navy only has one Recruit Training Center at Great Lakes, IL and they are training thousands of recruits.<br>  <br>  Did you get the Rate that you wanted to do? If so, it is highly likely that your A school doesn't have a slot until your August ship date. That means when you graduate from RTC , your A school will be ready for you to arrive.  <br>  <br>  Now if you want to spend 4 years doing something you don't like then maybe he can get your Rate changed and you can ship sooner. Believe me, you don't. I hated dealing with folks who are stuck in rate they never really wanted.|`|tDSMWIYTaa	there's nothing he can do to make the ball roll faster. he submits the paperwork, and when someone drops out that happens to have your rate, theyll give him a call and tell him theres a spot open, then he'll call you. he can't make someone drop out. you just gotta wait it out. <br>  he could call you tomorrow and ask if you want to leave the next day cause a spot opended up.|`|AA10230317	go ahead you may not get the job you want if you do that and the recruiter probably wants you to go sooner rather than later they get a bonus after people finish boot camp from what I hear

6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Did she get the employment visa in the Philippines or in Hong Kong?  Was her employment recruiter certified by the Philippine government?  Is she young and attractive?      Does she understand that many of the White Slavery operations in the Middle East often transport Filipinas to Hong Kong first, as tourists, and then on to the Middle East?  This is to avoid the strict controls the Philippines has placed on overseas recruitment of women.    If you don't hear from her again you should figure that she has ended up being transported to another country (Syria, Jordan Lebanon, Cyprus, etc...) and forced into prostitution.  If she's lucky they let her go when she's old and used up.  If she's not lucky you'll just never hear from her again.

UvzKiis0aa	No, the USA copied its government from the Iroquois League and other native American systems of democracy.    If USA copied Europe, we'd have a monarchy.|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	No, as far as government goes, our Founders were familiar with British Parliamentary rule and European monarchies, with ancient Greek democracy and the Roman Republic.  They picked things that worked, rejected things that tended toward tyranny, and created a new system under the  Constitution.  From this distance, it's sometimes hard to realize how smart, educated, and practical the designers of our government were and what a marvel they passed down to us.  They created something truly revolutionary, and that revolution continues today.  In the city named for a slave owner, a black man is President of the United States of America.      The American social form was also unique.  It had as its base not birth but ability.  High office transferred peacefully by the will of the people, not by inheritence without merit or by the power of guns or thugs or armies. America truly was, and remains, something apart, a place where a common idea of the betterment of all is a shared concept.      Speak of the "divine right of kings" or the "new Soviet man" or the "master race" and you're making a joke.  But say "all men are created equal" or "we, the people" and Americans understand exactly what you mean.  In the long, sad history of humanity and oppression, this is truly something worth cherishing and defending.|`|JhAghqiAaa	yes, most part of it.|`|2Fb1mZIZaa	No, certainly not. The original colonies wanted dependence from the United Kingdom because they opposed the society and the regulations put in place by 'old Europe'.    The US is the world's oldest democracy, as you might remember.    'Old Europe' was monarchistic, demanding high taxes from everyone of their citizens, including those in the colonies.    America pretty much was the exact opposite of what Europe looked like, and still does in big parts.|`|F1bjZjkaaa	Copy is not the right word. The USA was a part of the british empire and as such used british common law and other laws and the "americans" were considered british. So there is no suprise that US law ended up being similar to english law.   However, they imrpoved english law. The british still have the house of lords, while the US has two democratically elected houses and has done since 1789, it has a written document which is easier to understand and follow than the unwritten british constitution.    Other nations have a similar constitution to the US, Germany and Austria for example have a federal system with different laender or states within. This is a result of american influence upon their constitutional process after world war 1, when they lost their monarchs and had to become republics. German's was changed after WW2 but austria reinstated its post WW1 constition.     Many other countries like Spain have taken bits from the american style, and US influence in latin america is obvious, though there is a fight back in certain countries like Bolivia and Venezuela because of the problems the US has caused these countries they understandably do not want a govt that is very similar to the country that has kept them down for so long.    Is the US the world's oldest democracy? It depends on what you mean by democracy. Remember who could not vote, even into the 20th century.     As for the US not copying because they would have had a monarchy, this shows that perhaps people do not understand what was going on in England at this time.   There was a constant fight between the parliament and the monarchy. The monarch always needed money to fight wars, and only parliament could collect taxes (though some monarchs got around this), so the monarch had to allow the parliament to sit.   William of Orange and the Hannover kings George I, II, III & IV were the ones who developed the monarchy towards a system where the king was more figurehead rather than proper leader. By the time the US was founded the king did not have that much power, and the parliament was the main position of power, though the monarch still had power.  So again, this is not copying, they US did not copy, they adapted, improved and added to the basis that already existed from England.

boRpd2HDaa	If you have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, then getting a job as a turboprop mechanic would be like getting trained to work on choppers (like the show American Choppers or Orange County Choppers) and getting a job working on little girl tricycles. What is your GPA? If you have a 3.0 or higher consider becoming an Officer. In fact, with a mechanical engineering degree, you'd be a perfect candidate to become a fighter pilor or any other pilot for that matter. How is your eye sight? Financially, becoming an officer would be a much better move. Enlisted folks starting out make about maybe 18K a year. Officers starting out make twice that. And instead of raises being 100-200 dollars a month, as an officer your raises are like 700-1200 a month more. Yes you can get a GI Bill as enlisted but all military members get 100% Tuition Assistance while they are in both enlisted and officers. Check out the pay chart.     http://www.airforce.com/opportunities/of...    But really, any job as an officer would beat being enlisted. The AF is not like you see on the commercials where you are repositioning a satellite or communicating with Air Force one. As an enlisted member, prepare to spend plenty of time cleaning toilets, dusting off computer screens and keyboards, and arbitrarily sweeping flightlines
6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Yes, you can do that if you do not intend to stay in the United States after the marriage.  Just bring plenty of proof that you intend to go back to Australia.... apartment lease or home mortgage papers, letter from your employer stating that you are on holiday and the date you are expected to return to work, bank statements, school enrollment information, auto registration, insurance papers, etc...,  All this and more along with your ticket back home and you should be okay.    If your intention is to get married and stay in the United States then you are playing with fire.  Legally you are NOT supposed to enter the United States with such intentions while on a B-2 tourist visa or on the VWP.    What you should NOT do is just figure that it will all work out in the long run.  ICE and USCIS have adopted a very serious policy to get tough.

1E3MzC3Baa	The fact that she gave her consent is not the problem. The problem is that in the eyes of the law, she does not have the right to give that consent. As a minor, she does not hold the responsibilities expected from an adult, and thus she she does not hold some of those rights as well. The law is arbitrary in setting these ages. This particular law is in place to prevent young and immature persons from being taken advantage of. This may or may not be the case with your friend. We all know that people mature at different rates, and your friend may very well be mature compared to other girls her age. In a perfect world, the law would recognize this. However, this is not a perfect world and the law instead of being ideal, has to be fair. It has to apply the same way to everyone or it would apply to no one. I know this is not always the case, but that is the spirit of it.  One thing that cannot be excused however, is the actions of the 26 year old boyfriend. He is an adult, and as such is held responsible of his actions. Sex with a minor is illegal, this is common knowledge, and he ignored the law. He has no defense in my opinion.

We keep fighting there because we want to capture Osama and because while we are fighting there, it keeps Al-quida and Taliban from organizing any attacks on the US.  We are fighting them in their home not ours.      All this stuff about Democracy is just a side project, it is not the central issue of the war.  That is not why we went there.

It is about money.|`|VJlUpfjBaa	No we're trying to keep the peace in an area abundant in natural resources that we want. Mainly the oil. I think it's disgusting, and that we should start looking into renewable resources with every ounce of our surplus... but no... we keep making huge guns and telling people in other countries what to do. Democracy works anywhere, the same can be said of any form of government. Communism is even working for the Chinese. It's just a matter of having the power to make it work.|`|8Pl2DdEzaa	No it is not|`|yozsPWPZaa	kiddo,the problem is that these wacko fanatics are hell bent on destroying the WEST.you convert or die,that my good buddy is in the koran.this religion is still in the year 800.the christians cleaned up their act in about 1600.these assholes still do not get it.ever try  (their reward for jihad)  to screw 72 virgins after your dead without a body ????? yep,that fkng stupid ! is afghanistan worth fighting- no ! nuke the fkng place and clean up the human gene pool !|`|FlvUVPMWaa	Yes you are right, As American we do not have the right to dictate the lives of people in other countries. However, You must keep in mind that these Countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and other Couturiers are very Anti American and are Jealous of the United States. You have to remember we are a very young Country and have came very Far in a very short time.    Some Nations are building there Countries up and are becoming more Powerful. We are the most Powerful country in the world, However in recent years we are losing the fight in every aspect. Our Kids are getting dumber in school, they pay more attention to the media than whats really going on. They do not even have the common sense or the Intelligence to look into something themselves before they go believing what someone says.    However, we have to go to war every now and then. We have to remain Number 1, If you dont like it go live somewhere else.|`|plcwObqWaa	"There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others"    Do you think it's not? What would you expect from the west after 9/11? Terrorism can not, should not and will not be tolerated.    Remember we are not fighting aginst Afghanistan, we are fighting the Taliban, they have no country. We are working with the Afghan government to install peace in the region.|`|rigV4b4Faa	save the money for nhs and  bring our troops home,|`|0hrq96wqaa	It's not a war, and there is no front line. Because we're at war with no-one, and we're not engaging soldiers of another country. It's a POSTING, more than anything, and they're being killed by certain members of the indigenous population, who naturally enough don't want soldiers of another country (leagues away) in theirs, telling them how to live their lives. Brit and US soldiers are in A'stan for no reason connected with security of ither country. The Talivban's RPG's are nowhere near capable of reaching our respective countries.  The AlQaida training camp thing is bollocks also, but I can't be bothered to exlain it, it's late---|`|2EHpbdwIaa	Its a war of ideology if you ask me. The so called "developed world" against the so called "undeveloped" & "backwards" world. The west meats the east. Or the west tries unsuccessfully to transform the east.     There are some bits of Islamic culture that I happen not to like, I happen to think its a pretty sexist and homophobic culture. But if that's how people want to live then so be it.    As for sending our troops over to fight, we cant win. I bet we end up pulling out in a couple of years time, & when we do it will be the first official war that this country will have lost for decades. After what happened to the Russians going in there it was just suicide, Tony Blair must have been on bloody drugs when he sent our troops in, and why none of the military planners voiced concern is just beyond me. How can you invade a land locked country and keep it when every other country around it, including the one your in, dosent want you there. Even worse, after the failed attempt of what was probably the most powerfull army in the world at trying the same thing. Dont politicians & military planners in this country read history books anymore? At the end of the day insurgents will just keep coming through the borders & there is nothing you can do about it. Its actually one of the worst military disasters of the century as far as Britain is concerned. A complete & utter blunder. & Tony Blair wants shooting for helping to engineer the war in the first place.     Look at Vietnam, a war of capitalism against communism. This one is west versus east, developed versus non developed, civilised versus non civilised, christian versus non christian, western culture versus eastern culture, and as some argue; white versus non white. Either way you look at it it was a complete waste of time to start the war in the first place.      What pisses me off more than anything else is that Tony Blair sent our troops in there when the majority of the population in this country didnt want a war. And now that it has gone wrong people are going to carry on dying for nothing. Ive also got to work to pay for it. I hate that basterd I really do. I hope he rots for starting that war & the one in Iraq.
AA11163314	False.    The court can order that your wages be garnished, you savings account be seized or even order that your property be auctioned off to pay your debts.|`|9iXGakohaa	False!|`|XLQ9wCUaaa	Nice.     Good thinking.    Poor kids.|`|1HLPznZhaa	I feel for the poor children you sired.. To answer your question ... False !!! ...|`|85jy4Mt0aa	You just asked a similar question.  This one is just as childish.    By not showing up, you may deprive the Court some information that may serve the child's interests and may serve your interests.  But it does not deprive the Court the power to order support, order garnishment of wages, order garnishment of accounts, etc.    Little boys hide from difficult circumstances and hope that everything will be OK.  Men face the circumstances of life and deal with their obligations.  Especially if you are a father, it is time to stop being a little boy.|`|dc4516b235fea803596d1fc6b3cee990aa	OHHHHHHH it's true !!!!!! But don't expect to have ANYTHING after the courts are through with you !! You sired the child so fess up .
DTSUJe2oaa	No but some state may be different than this one.~  Justices and judges, with the exception of part-time municipal court judges, are prohibited from engaging in the private practice of law while serving in a judicial position. A person holding office as a judge or justice is governed by standards of professional conduct known as the Canons of Judicial Ethics. You may read the Canons of Judicial Ethics at the Judicial Inquiry Commission's web site
DTSUJe2oaa	On a suspended imposition of sentence you should list it and explain what it is.   Suspended Imposition of Sentence (SIS)    Disposition of a criminal case where the defendant is placed on probation without an actual sentence or period of incarceration being imposed. The defendant may be later sentenced and incarcerated if the conditions of probation are not successfully met
f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	Your age has nothing to do with it.  They cannot garnish your social security payment for consumer debt, nor can they levy any other pensions that you may get. They can, however, if they win a judgment against you, use all means available to them under the laws in your state to collect from you.  They can levy your bank accounts, and they can put liens on any property that you own, even your home. Keep in mind that they cannot make you move out of your home. They will collect the judgment when your home is sold.  If the judgment is not satisfied before you die, the creditor will collect it from your estate before your heirs get their share.    Bottom line, the creditor cannot force you out of your home.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	First, determine if it is truly a summons or just a fancy collection letter.  A summons is issued by the clerk of court.  It will have a cause number and an address of the court.  You can contact the clerk of the court to determine to what address you should send a written answer.  Consult your attorney as soon as possible.  If you rely on Social Security, you may qualify for Legal Aid.      If it is just a collection letter, you can ignore it or show it to your attorney.    If you ignore a court summons, the plaintiff may be able to take a default judgment.  Post judgment remedies can include writs to take assets (including bank accounts, but not homesteads).|`|1HLPznZhaa	You won't lose your home..Is there a family member that can assist you in this matter ?? If you have been threatened in this manner you may have a good law suit against the finance company.. You need someone to advise you on this.. Perhaps your pastor will know an attorney that will do this for you pro bono.. It's sad when our seniors are taking advantage of..|`|AA10295984	This depends. If you defaulted on your house payments, then YES they can. If you defaulted on some other loan, then NO they cannot. However, if you own more than one house, they can take the more valuable of the houses. I suggest that you go see Civil Legal Aid. If you are on social security, you should qualify for free legal assistance. To get their phone number you can either call your local court or go to your state's Bar Association web page. They may be listed in your phone book.|`|56b2673c86699181557ab8de443fae51aa	First of all Contact a Attorney and do it fairly quick. The date you were served the Civil Summons starts the clock ticking to a possible default judgment if you fail to answer the Summons and Complaint correctly and in the required time.    Your age would not play any part at all in a civil action.     If this Finance company is who you have you home financed with and you are behind on your payments then YES they can foreclose on it and take it from you through the courts.    Never ignore a Summons and Complaint. Doing so allows the attorney who filed it on behalf of the finance to get a default judgment and makes his job easy.    GET AN ATTORNEY TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND TO RESPOND TO THEM FOR YOU.
esOaJoqBaa	It is possible to fail. Getting through boot camp is 90% mental, you seem to have the physical part down so it is up to you to be mentally strong. If you are worried about being in intel that won't affect you until you MOS school. If you fail to pass that school they may pick a new MOS for you, most likely infantry.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Yes, it's possible to fail.  I believe the failure rate is between 5% and 10%.  Remember this, to fail you have to give up.  The Corps will not give up on you until you have given up on yourself.    As I understand it, you could walk on water and it would not get you any more respect from the DI's than the next guy.|`|0YtvCuakaa	I think you will be fine.|`|ZNew0DANaa	dude if gomer pyle couldn't fail, nobody can.  and look at how many times he f****d up!|`|941bdc645ba35ed9c1988fbce6d2ace8aa	You can fail if you choose to.    The Marine Corps will give you every opportunity to pass, get in better shape and retake and redo anything you fail.    Of course this will make boot camp longer then the scheduled 13 regular weeks and you will have to be put back a phase or something. But at least you will have finished and earned the EGA in the end.    Good luck|`|d8iBD5aSaa	yes it is but i think you will do fine. they give you another chance is you do. a lot of boot camp is mental and just keep your mind focused on what you want to do and keep your goal in mind and you will be fine.
5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Depends on how valuable your time is.  If the court is convenient to you, and it wouldn't be a major pain to go to court ... try and fight it.    If the time fighting the ticket is worth less than the $90 to you ... just pay the ticket and be done with it.  You might get lucky with your explanation in court, it sounds reasonable to me.  The final decision is yours, which is more valuable ... your money or your time?|`|OLCoFKQraa	suck it up, you did the wrong thing, you should have got in the correct lane much sooner, plus $90 isn't much, it will you cost you more in fees and lost income to take this pitifully small fine to court.|`|8hAhmlJjaa	If you think you were in the right, then fight it.  But you were in the wrong.  The center lane for turning has a limited distance for travel, by law.  The reason is safety, if you are driving straight in that lane and another car needs that lane to make their turn, you just blocked them and traffic is now at a stand still.  My advise is to learn from your mistake and pay the ticket.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	Its not worth fighting,driving all the way to left tun lane from center lane only is illegal as you are blocking the cars from turning on either sides.
WgruZkHRaa	Talk to a lawyer. If people with less seniority, have not been laid off, you have a case. Good luck|`|gxdej2deaa	honestly, i can't make a judgment about this because may companies are undergoing HUGE layoffs....without knowing what kind of work you do or who you work for, i can't really make a decision about the reasoning for the layoff|`|AA10295984	If you belong to a Union, you should consult your Union Steward IMMEDIATELY. Also, read your company's employment policies and employee handbook. There are procedures that you will have to follow, and possibly a way to keep your job contained in those procedures. If you do not belong to a union, you should still read the policies very carefully, and take copies of them to an attorney. You will be limited in the number of days you have to file a grievance. If you wait too long, you will be penalized and have no recourse.|`|Lt8Fg5Ekaa	Some injuries can be healed, and you can return to work when healed.  Some injuries  are exacerbated by work (work might make permanent injuries).    It would be nice to be paid for a work related injury while you heal, and it would be nice to know that you would be taken care of in you sustained permanent injuries.  Courts and government agencies might help (depending on the political party).    Republicans believe that only the rich deserve government welfare, healthcare, food, housing, workman's compensation, etc.  In some states Republicans tried to pass laws to force truckers to drive continuously for up to 72 hours.  (After 3 days of a truck driver staying awake, his truck would be like a lethal weapon on the highway).  Republicans want to cut out unions, cut out workman's compensation, prevent family leave, etc.  We just finished 8 years of a Republican president, and it is doubtful that you could get much help (especially during the economic depression left in his wake).    After 9 years of employment, you might lose your retirement (it was likely not portable).  You might lose your HMO coverage.  If your HMO knows how you are injured (lets say, spinal stenosis, for example), they could blacklist you so that no other HMO would ever allow you to get a health plan.    In California, there are health plans for major risk people (called Mr. MIP) (Major Risk Medical Insurance Program).  On MRMIP, depending on your age, you would pay about $5,000 to $10,000 per year for coverage, and, in addition, pay as much as a private doctor would charge for an office visit (about $65), x-rays (many hundreds of dollars), and when you exceed the $5,000 deductible, they will only charge a copay to a cap of $25,000.  Lets say you get cancer, and your medical bill is $250,000, you will pay until you reach the deductible ($5,000), then they will pay until they reach the  cap ($25,000), which means that they pay $20,000.  Thus, your total out of pocket expenses on MRMIP would be about $230,000.     If you are capable of typing an application for Social Security Disability, you are not a vegetable (because you can type), so they won't pay you.  You won't get paid unless you type an application, either.  In short, you can't get paid.    There are a lot of people who are too injured to work and yet not injured enough to get compensation.  I believe that you might be in that category.    Lets hope that your injuries don't drive you into a long term care home.  If you are on Medicare (age 65), you can't stay long in a long term care facility (those facilities charge someone (Medicare or you) $5,000 to $25,000 per month.  At the  $25,000 per month facilities, you would get illegal aliens, who can't speak English, to taunt you if they respond to nurse call buttons at all.  Mostly, you can't call a nurse, even if you are having a heart attack.  They "might" change your diaper once every 8 hours if you have diarrhea (or might not).  They are held to Federal and state standards, but those standards do nothing about the care you receive. You will be lucky to get gruel for food, and you will be surrounded by screaming patients who are incoherent (at some facilities, more than 30 percent have been tied down against their will, and even more given sedatives to knock them out or keep them senseless).  You will likely be forced to sign a contract forcing you to give up your right to sue and to pay more money if you complain about anything (your complaint would do no good anyway, and that is assuming that you would still be conscience and knocked out by the Mickeys that they slip you).  Your food would be prepared in a kitchen that would not pass a health inspection, and the bug parts and rat droppings would be common.  Dirt would be on your dishes (considered supplementary minerals and nutrients).     President Clinton and his wife tried to pass a health care reform bill (to hold down the soaring costs and to provide better service), but they were ridiculed for trying.    You might try to apply for workman's compensation (though now, in the middle of a depression, you won't get anywhere).  In California, they diverted all of their people to pay unemployment claims and they don't answer phones anymore to handle unemployment issues (the backlog is huge).  People qualify for funding, but they are not able to get it.    Lawyers would likely not want to touch a case like yours.  They want hard proof that your job caused injuries and that those injuries are severely debilitating for life.  There is now a cap (imposed by Republicans) of $250,000 for pain and suffering, and no lawyer could pay for tests to prove that and go to court and win a settlement for that (given the cost and probability of losing).

Afterward, the order continues throughout the Cabinet as they were added in the history of the Cabinet existence. After that its the Governors of the States in the Union and their Senators.

It's one of the things that makes them civilized.    Most Americans support stronger gun control laws, BTW.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	NO, there is a lot of false information spread about this subject. Most countries have laws only slightly stricter than in the US. First of all, almost all countries permit the use of firearms for hunting. All that allow hunting also allow personal ownership for this purpose. Most countries also allow personal ownership of guns for competitive shooting.    Here is the biggest difference. Most countries require licensing and registration of firearms so they know who has guns, and where. The NRA and many Americans who understand the intent of the second amendment fight these rules. Once the government knows where the guns are, they can come and take them.    England and Australia both permit ownership of guns, but they control type and numbers owned.    People want us to think that other countries ban guns, to make their schemes seem more pallatible. Leslie's list is blatantly incorrect. See sources below.

The stimulus bill is a completely different type of Hog.  It's not necessary -- as there are economists claiming it's been tried like this before (finance-backed spending) and failed miserably w/ FDR.    2/3 of it is pork spending and has nothing to do with creating jobs.    1/3 of it will go into infrastructure but it won't be in the system until the beginning of next year 2010.

But still the hundreds of billions of dollars shows up and supposively makes everything all better, like your mommy did when you had a cut on your finger and she kissed it and put a bandaid on it.  The social welfare, the fountain of social programs and money erupting from nowhere makes me sick to my stomach.  The Federal Reserve prints more money...the dollar is worth less.  Bailing out companies that will fall later on anyway... is it worth it...I don' t think so. Socialism is spreading the wealth around...making thins equal... I hate it, and it fails miserably.

fgIbNRHfaa	Does you boss have at least 50 employees within a 75 mile radius of your work site?  If so, you don't need a maternity clause to be protected because you will be protected by the Family Medical Leave Act.  The FMLA states that a covered employer must allow employees to take up to 12 weeks of leave for a "serious health condition."  Pregnancy is a covered condition.  You could use the leave for prenatal visits, absences due to morning sickness, the actual birth and maternity leave following the birth.  Under the FMLA, your employer must give you the time off and cannot retaliate against you in any way for taking the protected leave.<br>  <br>  Even if your employer doesn't have enough employees to be covered by the FMLA, you are probably covered by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (there is still a minimum number of employees, but I think it is only 15 or 20 employees).<br>  <br>  That being said, if you choose to ask him to include something about maternity leave in your contract and he retaliates against you for asking, you probably have a valid gender discrimination claim.  Since you want the maternity leave and not a lawsuit, I would broach the subject like this: "Although I know I am protected by federal and state law concerning medical and pregnancy leave, I would really like to have something about it in our contract as well"  That way you are gently letting him know that you know your rights!  Good luck!|`|eulMjLtPaa	Do you mean coverage on your health plan, or maternity leave?<br>  <br>  It depends where you live, but in most cities he's not required to provide any kind of health coverage.  If the business has more than 50 employees, he is required to provide maternity leave. <br>  <br>  It couldn't hurt to ask.  Only you know if he would be "meaner" to you.|`|RDQittNDaa	If there are more than 50 employees at your job then you would qualify for 12 weeks of maternity leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  I'm not sure what state you're in, but in Ohio pregnant mothers are a protected class and any form of discrimination against them by employers is illegal and punishable by law.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	If your boss is that horrible, find a new job. No company owes you a living, it's a mutually beneficial relationship. You do something he needs done, and he gives you money you need to live.<br>  <br>  If you are going to miss 12 weeks or more due to having a baby, there should be some sort of give from your side. Imagine you were the boss and had to try to run a company while some people got to take 12 week vacations while others did not. Those others are picking up your slack while you're gone. Why shouldn't they get something extra for their efforts? And, the extra should come from you. <br>  <br>  .

YePcg0bHaa	I really like your honest to God and yourself attitude! I have a lot of people in my unit in your position....so one of them said they needed help but wasnt motivated themselve. So she asked someone that was good at PT to set up a 3-days a week remedial program...when you have an accountability person that has been there done that and knows how to get you there, you and other people struggling with PT can push yourselves to reach your goals. You just need to write specific goals down like: I want to pass 60% each event in the APFT or something like that for each event. Then you need to develop a plan to reach those goals...like a weekly plan until your next PT test. Keep a log of it and watching yourself progress on paper is a huge motivator. If you are serious about it, just tell yourself that is what you have to do to be a better soldier, to motivate other people in the unit, and just be in better shape individually. Mark on your calendar the times you will do PT and make sure you do more than what the max is for each event, like run 2.5 miles instead of two, then when you are actually doing the PT test it wont be that hard. Good luck to you!|`|PPKuHl9baa	Usually I didn't start training until about 3 weeks before the PRT. It sucks. I was active duty however so my motivation was failing.

The boy was at fault as well, by ignoring all the instructions, so that is why the parents' case was dismissed.

uvWH4Ioyaa	There are other avenues to pursue such as the medical licensing board which could go by names like Board of Registration of Medicine depending on your country, state or province.  Criminal prosecutions are difficult because, in the US, a guilty verdict requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt for each element of the offense(s).  The UK may also require a higher standard of proof for criminal cases than for civil ones. Any or all of the victims could also go after the doctor in a civil suit.  Just like the O.J. Simpson case, after he was found not guilty of killing his ex-wife and Ron Goldman, O.J. lost the civil case and now owes the Goldman estate millions of dollars. You do risk a defamation lawsuit from the doctor if you attack him publicly with a boycott. You must choose your words very carefully and be sure to say things that are not only true by provable and irrefutable evidence.

Live by making stupid and assumptive blanket statements.<br>  <br>  Free clinics are never free.  Poor and low income do pay taxes, unless they are on social security disability or have enough children.   Even then they pay taxes.   If you had been there for more than a year you would know that.  It takes at least a year being low income to discover the system is severely lacking.  What the system gives in one breath it takes away in another breath.   I have been on both sides.  I was middle class and now am disabled.  Food stamps are a joke.  Social security is a joke.  After doing the dutiful thing of doing it all right, I became disabled and qualified for all of  (With current raises) $694 a month in disability, and $53 in food stamps.   It took two years to be approved for disability.  In the meantime, you lose everything due to selling or repo.  By the time you receive meager ssdi, you have nothing left, and are usually living with relatives (if you are lucky).  You have no choice but to get government help.  Yes I do receive medical assistance.  Every January I receive a tiny raise, generally about 5 to 10 dollars a month, then I receive a letter taking away part of my food stamps.  Who do you know who can feed themselves on $53 a month, even cooking everything scratch.  They do not take into consideration that you physically may not be able to cook.  <br>  If you  work minimum wage, you will have to work more than one job.  On minimum wage you DO NOT qualify for government assistance unless you have children.  Then that assistance is small and gauged by your income.  If you make even one dollar more you are bumped to the next level.  Even if you are low income but not disabled you usually have health conditions that make walking to public transportation or to childcare then public transportation, impossible.  If you are minimum wage, cheap childcare for one child will subtract  half your monthly income.  Two children, 3/4 your income for the month.  At some point you do qualify for assistance but you have to have the job first, and  because it takes sometimes a month or more to get assistance for daycare started.  <br>  The poor still have all the bills you do, but less to pay them on.  Be honest and mentally cut your income to minimum wage and see if you could do it.  They still have medical bills, car insurance or transportation costs, utilities, rent, phone, food.  You can only cut those so much.   They are everybody....some deadbeats, some disabled, some married, some single parents, some intelligent, some not so intelligent, some healthy, some not healthy.  What do we all have in common, we are all humans with needs.  Part of my family believe the way many of you do, and  that is one of the ideas that keeps people needing help.  Most often, government assistance, causes problems, and takes away more than it gives.  If I received a few dollars more a month I would not receive any food stamps.  If I tried to work, and made any money, just $20 would start disqualifying me for food stamps and medical.  I would hit a level.  To overcome that level I would have to be absolutely sure I could make double my disability, as my medical, food stamps and section 8 would stop.  Even then I couldn't pay my for my medical.  Most low income or minimum wage jobs, don't offer insurance, and if they do, they set an hour you can work limit, so you  won't qualify.  You have to work 40 hours to qualify and they won't let you.  They will however hire another person to work the hours they won't let you work.  The job industry has come up with an answer to all assistance if you try to work.  Those people you think are getting assistance darn well need it.  <br>  <br>  By the way, the person asking the question did not indicate they were low income.  The derogatory remarks, only cause you to look like uniformed idiots.  Yes the federal and state governments should do something, like either helping significantly or giving all the money back and stopping taxes.  Poor people did not get this way over night, often it is a history going back through government and society interference  instead of help.<br>  Mr. 50 years ago....Taxes were not like this then.  Prices were not like this then.  Also lower income people were generally working on farms and had lower price places to live and less government requirements to pay for and live up to.  The less intelligent people had a livable wage in society or were taken care of by family.<br>  <br>  Mr. Benjamin Franklin, the poor are already uncomfortable.  You don't need to make them more so.  Making them uncomfortable does not increase their intelligence, increase time, increase energy,

However, I think the clear cut logical answer to this is in the form of a question...."What else CAN he do?"<br>  <br>  We can say "let's just leave it in the hands of the American People". How can we do that, when we tried that already. The American People squandered their savings buying houses they couldn't afford.<br>  <br>  We can't say "let's leave it up to the banks and main street to fix this". We can't say this because, we've tried that already, too. It's been stated time and time again about the high level of mis-managed investments and the like that has ALSO contributed to this messotopia.<br>  <br>  So, what else can we do?

Sources?<br>  <br>  You cited a biased blog!?  What a dumbass.<br>  <br>  **How does the planning and design of a building help America?  Do you have any clue how much the development economy (planning, architecture, civil engineering, construction, utilities, plumbing, electricians, etc...) is suffering right now?  It's one of the hardest hit parts of the economy.  I'm a city planner and our workload has been dwindling since early 2008 because of the changes in loan policies and things like that.  <br>  <br>  I work for a private engineering firm, and I have read the stimulus bill as well.  There are plenty of things built into the stimulus bill that will benefit the economy for years to come.  Implementing new types of infrastructure, transportation and energy production are the key to making this a sustainable development economy, and if oil companies were smart they would begin to spend more time participating in the crossover to alternate energies.  They could probably stand to make a good bit of money off of that as well.<br>  <br>  Clearly you haven't taken too much time to think about how the stimulus bill is a long-term solution.  It's not simply handing money out to banks that are in trouble (it is often oversimplified to this).  You're just repeating buzzwords that you hear all the time like "earmarks" and listening to whatever your favorite talking head tells you. <br>  <br>  I have already been seeing an increase in my workload in the office since last week because there is more confidence among lenders.  That puts money in the hands of developers.  Developers hire a firm like mine for design, community impact analysis, permitting, county approval, etc...  Once a project has approval, it goes out to bid and different kinds of contractors are hired to construct a project.  After that, the project at hand is sold to a homeowner, business owner, whatever...<br>  <br>  That's how the money stimulates the development economy.<br>  <br>  Imagine this money being designated to updating public works, transportation, utilities and such (the real meat of the stimulus bill).  Sounds like that's creating years of work and opportunities for investors doesn't it?|`|PSc1BEZTaa	It is all over the News about the 9.000 earmarks, yet somebody had to ask for a link....must be an Obama supporter, they never know anything!<br>  And even CNN said it, ...now that is news we can believe in!.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	Yes its true!

c42c8d31a8e4cbf5411d46cc0062566caa	From the way I understand it, Taylor will be sentenced on the 14th of December, after the trial for Vick.  This gives the state a good opportunity to have Taylor helping them.  BTW it looks like this guy stopped the dogfighting stuff in 2004.  Maybe he is pleading guilty because he has a conscience.<br>  <br>  It's obvious that there was a dog fighting program going on at a property that Vick owned.  The indictment paints a picture of Vick being there and taking a strong part in the kennel.   The thing the state is going to have to prove is Vick traveling to these fights and being involved in the things they say he has been involved in.  Having bank records, phone records, and other paper track of this will help them. If Taylor tells the whole story, Vick may really be in a lot more hot water than he thought he was going to be.<br>  <br>  ***Taylor signed a statement saying that Vick almost completely funded the whole dog fighting.  Pretty serious charges***|`|jYAs9ogtaa	What he did is not defensible.  He should admit his wrong doing and apologize to the world for his disgusting behavior.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	caliber is only the size of the bore/bullet, however what makes the weapon is the powder charge in the round.  A perfect example is the .357 and .38 special.  Essentially it's the same weapon, but the .357 is a much more powerful round.  .223/5.56mm is essentially a .22 caliber bullet with a very large powder charge-again not the bore but the cartridge.<br>  The .40/10mm was created by the FBI who wanted the stopping power of .45/11mm but better controlability (primarily by female agents-smaller hands, generally speaking).  <br>  Some calibers are holdovers from black powder days:  .35, .41, .45-70-and it's a heritage issue for manufacturers and owners.<br>  Some calibers are to create a niche in the market as well.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	different calibers have different effects obviously.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Because they were devised at different times, with different technology and are used for different purposes in often very different weapons.<br>  <br>  For instance, 0.357 Magnum is actually the same caliber as 0.38 Special and 0.38 Special rounds can be fired from revolvers chambered for the Magnum round.  0.357 Mag came about because of a need for a more powerful cartridge in that caliber with greater stopping power.  0.38 Special though is still popular with many who find it easier to shoot or require a firearm that is lighter and smaller.<br>  <br>  0.40 S&W came about from a percieved need for a pistol round that was more powerful than 9x19mm Parabellum but easier to shoot than 0.45 ACP and came on the heels of the failure of a similar 10mm cartridge developed for the FBI.  <br>  <br>  Some calibers were developed for specific firearms and were thus promoted by the makers of that firearm.  And as pointed out above you can't just look at the diameter of the bullet as there is a big difference between different rounds of even the same caliber.|`|113f96e86c976547fe006e5fe6d83fabaa	The same reason golfers use so many different clubs.<br>  Each one has specific purpose for which it was designed.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Because it confuses Democrats when they try to ban specific guns.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	Because we can.<br>  <br>  This is America, and we love our guns.

For example: if you look simply at air rifles, the two main calibres are .177 and .22. <br>  <br>  .177 pellets travel very far, very quickly, making them ideal for killing small animals/birds, or for target shooting.  .22 pellets travel slightly shorter distances, but as they are a larger pellet, travel slightly slower, but have a greater momentum, hence making them suitable for larger animals/birds.<br>  <br>  Another thing that might explain the wide range of calibres might lay in the commercialised side of shooting.  Even with air rifles, this issue is present.  For example, there are two types of .22 pellets.  Most manufacturers make their guns for the larger type, but my Weihrauch HW90K only takes the smaller type.  This means I have to pay ￡10 for a tin of special pellets rather than ￡5 for regular ones.<br>  <br>  It's a great gun, though, so I'm not complaining!<br>  <br>  The point being: there may be so many different calibres so that the companies making the guns and ammunition can forge deals with each other by making awkward calibres and ammo, hence generating more money for themselves.<br>  <br>  It may be something completely different, but that's my ten pence worth!
