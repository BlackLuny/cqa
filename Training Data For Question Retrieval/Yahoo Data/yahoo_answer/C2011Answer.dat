All you need to do is buy a travel converter/adapter plug...which are not expensive at all, and can be bought at any place that sells travel goods or electronics. <br>  You simply plug your battery charger plug into it, then plug both into the wall socket. This really is the cheapest and easiest way to charge your battery. <br>  <br>  Just make sure the adapter is ok for all countries that you visit. If not, you can buy them individually or as a multi set.<br>  <br>  p.s. remember to give your battery a charge every night, especially after a long day of shooting. This will ensure you don't run out of battery power mid way through the day.

RpCwfcRzaa	Half of those are things that can't be changed like messing with the TruSkill matching and country preference. Those are decided by MS for all of Live, not Epic. They fix what they feel needs to and can be fixed without totally remaking the game. They do listen to what the Gears community thinks and takes those suggestions into consideration, but most of the things you have mentioned can't/ shouldn't be fixed or would be a waste of time and energy to do so.

HD DVD discs hold 15GB (single sided) or 30GB (double-sided). Although this would seem to give Blu-ray a significant advantage, 15GB is enough room—just barely—to fit a high-definition movie.<br>  <br>  HD DVD players and drives are a lot cheaper than Blu-ray devices. Blu-ray players will cost between $1,000 and $1,500 at launch.

When PC Magazine tested the HD-A1, we found it to be very much a first-generation product, with a few bugs to be worked out. Still, there was no denying the excellent image quality it produced. And being first to market does give the format some advantage.<br>  <br>  Samsung shipped its BD-P1000 Blu-ray player ($999.99 list) to retailers this week and will start selling them to consumers on June 25.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about these systems is that the drives can burn Blu-ray discs too.<br>  <br>  Although it has a built-in HD DVD drive, the Toshiba Qosmio G35-AV650 ($2,999.99 direct) cannot record content onto HD DVDs. That and some issues with the video playback led us to be less than impressed with the system as a whole.|`|3F281z1eaa	Blue-ray disks have way better graphics and better sound.

AA10740859	Who says peanut butter takes scratches out of CDs? I would think that would cause more scratches. (especially if you use crunchy) Once a surface has been scratched - the material that makes up that surface has been permanently disturbed and really cannot be restored without re-doing the surface with that same material. The smears of the peanut butter would change the reflectivity of the surface and affect how the CD plays.

lQao8Wt0aa	The 14-42mm lens has a close focus of 0.25m ( 10 inches ) compared to 0.9m ( 36 in. ) for the 40-150mm.  If you want to shoot portraits - face sized photos of friends, best to use the 40-150 from 6 feet or so, so their face doesn't appear distorted.  You probably need to get more familiar with the range of each lens.  Switch to manual focus, and play with the zoom.  If the subject is outside the range of the lens, it can't focus correctly.
tHjBr4L4aa	Typically, it means the the camera was dropped and the lens is misaligned so it won't retract when powered off.<br>  <br>  The lenses are usually on plastic screw-threads that gears catch onto when extending or retracting them.  Often, the lens gets misaligned and the camera's "stuck".  Think of a lid that got twisted on crooked and you'll get a general idea.<br>  <br>  I had it happen once (knock on wood) and managed to pull the lens straight, allowing the camera to work again.  Otherwise, it's a visit to a camera service center.<br>  <br>  If the lens is stuck straight, you can take pictures, but the optical zoom won't work.  If it's stuck, but off-center, then the pictures won't be in focus.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope it's easily fixable.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	It's a common problem with point-n-shoot digital cameras - probably won't take a pic but will play them back from a card.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	That could mean anything.

I'd recommend staying away from it, but you if must, than give it a try, but buy it used at a GameStop if you can.

05ade181559562e4d7cbef274df75c61aa	You're not the only one that's tired of it. I'm having major text issues.  <br>  <br>  I've had text issues here and there since I got the service about 2 years ago, but nothing too bad.  Wednesday I stoped receiving text msgs and anything I sent was never received. The strange thing is that I didn't receive any text msgs from cell phones (different carriers also) but I did receive texts from my email address. I let it go for an hour, it usually clears up on it's own, but it didn't so I called them.  Right away they told me that they were experiencing "system errors" with text msging and that it wasn't just me.  They had me do a quick reprogram on my phone and said to wait an hour and it should be fixed.  30 mins later, everything was fine, i was able to sent and recieve texts normally (but the other texts were lost)<br>  <br>  Then today, right now, it happened again.  This time I called them when i first noticed it, and explained that it happened a couple of days earlier. They had me turn off the phone, then do that update again, and it worked fine (for 30 mins) tech support even tested it with me... and now it's the same crap all over again.<br>  <br>  the thing they told me this time is that about 3 weeks ago they did an upgrade to the text msging system to make it better.  and they are in the process of "working out the bugs"... and the more people they have calling about a problem the more they can do about it.  If 20 people from the same area call in with the same problem, the status of the issue changes to "nation wide" problem and the engineers become involved.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can think of at this point is to keep calling them, and if you know anyone else who has a sprint phone in your area, ask them to call in and "report" the problem, they might be having the same problem and just don't care. 20 complaints seems to be the magic number for something to be done|`|AA10056030	i have sprint but i dont have a problem. but dont switch to cingular or verizion i had both and they had crappy service. maybe its just your phone?? lift ur anntenna on your phone maybe it will work better|`|ada40d3b6df3c4eac958682beba44a67aa	I didn't really read that paragraph but from experience I'm sorry that I'm cruel enough to have an automatic answer:<br>  Get Verison.

I am unsure of your situation, but if you are talking in general and want to extend your battery life, go to settings, brightness, and lower the level - I usually set mine to the minimum unless I am watching a movie.  Also, you can turn the backlight completely off if there is light in your surroundings - or you can at least set it to turn off after 2 seconds.

a072695a05539e74377fd75ec6e7d1feaa	The Apple iPhone<br>  <br>  Capping literally years of speculation on perhaps the most intensely followed unconfirmed product in Apple's history -- and that's saying a lot -- the iPhone has been announced today. Yeah, we said it: "iPhone," the name the entire free world had all but unanimously christened it from the time it'd been nothing more than a twinkle in Stevie J's eye (comments, Cisco?). Sweet, glorious specs of the 11.6 millimeter device (that's frickin' thin, by the way) include a 3.5-inch 480 x 320 touchscreen display with multi-touch support and a proximity sensor to turn off the screen when it's close to your face, 2 megapixel cam, 4GB or 8 GB of storage, Bluetooth 2.0 with EDR and A2DP, WiFi that automatically engages when in range, and quad-band GSM radio with EDGE. Perhaps most amazingly, though, it somehow runs OS X with support for Widgets, Google Maps, and Safari, and iTunes (of course) with CoverFlow out of the gate. A partnership with Yahoo will allow all iPhone customers to hook up with free push IMAP email. Apple quotes 5 hours of battery life for talk or video, with a full 16 hours in music mode -- no word on standby time yet. In a twisted way, this is one rumor mill we're almost sad to see grind to a halt; after all, when is the next time we're going to have an opportunity to run this picture? The 4GB iPhone will go out the door in the US as a Cingular exclusive for $499 on a two-year contract, 8GB for $599.

Your local Radio Shack Store can provide you with a few that will first plug into the cigarette lighter, then give you a reg house plug to plug up AC Devices from the house. One provides an output of 75 watts, stock # 220-0153. Another has an output of 150 watts, stock # 220-0154. The last has an output of 350 watts containing two AC plug-ins and hooks directly to the cars battery. Hope this helps, Larry (RadioShack 9590)

11fd8bdf401aaf3e053990e864a05e8caa	Airtel seems to have consciously decided to go for the belly of the market and aggressive market expansion, while Hutch seems to be pursuing a relatively more sophisticated consumer. There isn't a great deal of differentiation in terms of pricing, services, schemes and so on, but there are differences in approach. Overall, AirTel is focused on functionality and efficiency, while Hutch has veered towards warmth and emotions.<br>  Hutch has developed a more effective branding strategy purely through its emotional connect with customers. While Hutch used the powerful visual imagery of a dog, Airtel chose to use music, which is not nearly as effective. Ad recall for Hutch has always been much higher.<br>  Still, Airtel is more powerful by sheer physical presence, while Hutch has been too fragmented.<br>  Brands of most mobile service providers enjoy a high unaided recall. One would assume that this high level of awareness is driven by a constant media presence. But this logic does not explain recall for BPL Mobile in Mumbai, which has minimal media presence. In such a scenario, it would not be right to conclusively say that Brand A is stronger than Brand B. However, if you consider adoption of the service by consumers as an indicator of brand strength, then Airtel would rank reasonably high. <br>  Hence, as there is no such big difference but still Airtel enjoys an edge over Hutch and in such competitive era an edge gives you an excellence in your field.|`|c8ed30a688e754d4ad24ba0514d84445aa	HUTCH...To me,this is better one!|`|1d29085ad0e57153dd7e34e4ac63690aaa	It depends..<br>  <br>  E.g. in Bombay Hutch is more popular, whereas in Kolkata Airtel..<br>  <br>  But both fails in the non- urban area .. for those places, BSNL is the best.

64b458dc74ea429f7b0d9b794715dd0daa	Make your own chart. The math is fairly straight forward (although I'm surprised at how many people screw it up and create new mythology because they can't do simple math).<br>  <br>  When you download to your PC, the pixel on your camera gets translated to a dot on your screen. All monitors have a standard dot density of 75 dots per inch.<br>  <br>  So a 6Mp picture (2000x3000) would be <br>  <br>  2000 dots  by  3000 dots<br>  --------------------------------<br>  75dpi               75dpi<br>  <br>  or 26.67 inches by 40 inches (no kidding!)<br>  <br>  So in theory your picture should be good enough for a small poster. If you take it to a print shop they can turn it into a life size poster 6' high! This is possible because a PC dot does not equal a printer dot. The relationship is totally dependant on the rendering software that comes with the printer.<br>  <br>  Most PC printers are adequate but not great. The larger Epson and Canon photo printers that can handle 13" - 20" wide paper would be more than up to the task. These printers produce super results because of the number of ink cartidges, the print head and most importantly the rendering software. Larger commercial printers are able to print images at widths up to 8-10'.<br>  <br>  So all that marketing hype about megapixels = quality is just that - hype. The biggest impact (pun intended) on the quality of a print is the printer it's printed on. The next biggest factor is the quality of the lens. Then things like aperture, shutter speed, film/sensor speed come in to play.<br>  <br>  You can take the same picture over and over with all the major 6Mp brands and the best ones are going to come from the DLSR's. The only reason they are better is because of the optics in front of the camera.<br>  <br>  If you want great prints buy a great camera.|`|e98c15c4652fbf8970848a60a87e4e9daa	Here is a good chart: <a href="http://www.americancamera.us/ac/faq.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.americancamera.us/ac/faq.php</a><br>  But then it helps to figure it out on your own by doing some test prints.

fb6fd100e0d59de169c1813b802d805baa	Your phone crashes most likely because when you run applications you exit them by pressing the RED Button (end call button). That results in minimizing the application rather than closing it. So when your run 5 or 6 apps your phone memory runs out and causes it to crash or hang, as you call it. Best way to tell how many apps are currently running on your Nokia SmarthPhone is to press and hold the Menu key for 1 -2 seconds. Then the only thing that should be running is the telephone. Everything else you see on that list highlight and press C to close it (completely exit it). If your phone still crashes  then go to <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/a4226014..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nokia.co.uk/a4226014...</a> download the phone software updater. Read the instructions carefully, and see if there is available update for your phone. If there is, make sure to back up your phone first (using PC Suite)! Then go ahead and update it. If there is no software update available just go ahead and reinstall the firmware. If the problem still persist contact your retailer and exchange it for a new one or have them fix. it. <br>  P.s: Also make sure you format the memory card or remove it and see if it makes any difference, sometimes faulty memory cards can cause the phone to crash as well.|`|AA11534386	I have a N73 since the day of its release and so far i've had no problem at all with it and i can say i'm really happy with it!<br>  <br>  Press the "green" button for a few seconds to see if you have any applications running.<br>  <br>  If no, back up your phone with Nokia Pc Suite and try to update your phone firmware with the Updater on the Nokia website.<br>  <br>  I hope you will manage to sort it out because i think the N73 is a great phone to own!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|59871b5553cd6cd7d8441fdef5a0c5f5aa	Send it back or take it back.

f99934d9f28cd9391db0d3e94d635420aa	Most likely you don't have any "bad" components; sometimes they will age and thereby have slightly different electrical characteristics. What you need to do is called White Balance. Open the lower front, you should see a little black plastic thingy with 6 knobs, this is the screen and focus controls for each of the three CRTs. Tune in a black and white channel, (or turn the color all the way down), then adjust for a black and white picture, vs black and red like you have now. Once you are satisfied that the black and white is actually black and white, you can turn the color back up, and it should seem more normal now. Another thing you could do is to reduce the color level. Most manufacturers overdrive that control, becasue they're still tied to the past, when color TV was a new thing and people liked to exagerate the color.|`|dfaa66fd224289d4620f836fffd578f9aa	Well go to the Tv menus and customize the color and put less red!<br>  Example :<br>  Go to menu<br>  Put ''screen''(or other similar option)<br>  change the contrast..<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i help

cQbZINw0aa	i work for best buy and this happens alot. What you can do is reset your ipod when this happens. How u do that is hold the menu button down and the middle button at the same time. Hold them down until you see that apple sign appear on the screen. All your songs will still be on your ipod. If this has happened more then a couple times in a short period of time there is a problem with it. Have you had it for less then 1 year...if you have then you can send it to apple and they will repair it for you. (u jjust have to pay shiping and haddleing) If its before 6 months that you have purchased you ipod apple will pay for the S&H. <br>  <br>  i hope that helped you out <br>  <br>  ***You can check to see how long u have untill the warrenty expires too on their website under support. it just asks the serial number which is located on the back of your ipod

5qSFaYgLaa	It really depends on the features you want out of your phone.  The enV is awesome for text messaging.  You should go to a store and check out both phones.
qZLdzNnbaa	It really depends on what you're going to use your phone for. If you intend to use multimedia features more, go with Helio. If you don't see yourself being a heavy data user, go with Verizon.<br>  <br>  I think both the basic plans are similar price-wise but not feature-wise, so Helio is probably the best for your money.<br>  <br>  Also, Helio runs off Sprint's network. So coverage should not be too much of an issue either way.<br>  <br>  Also, here's a comparison of those two phones. The Ocean has a better camera and a keyboard but otherwise they're similar.<br>  <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/compare.php?id%5B%5D=1082&id%5B%5D=1049&id%5B%5D=&id%5B%5D=&id%5B%5D=" rel="nofollow">http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/compare...</a>|`|47d244d62e953f06f3f23fd44440a3bcaa	Go with verizon, service is a lot better.<br>  <br>  + thats a really cool phone, my friend has it.|`|Fgaqf8q0aa	i personally have the ocean and its just amazing. the thing with helio is that data is included in their plans. so i don't have to worry about exceeding data transfers. i'm not sure if same goes with verizon.<br>  <br>  with coverage and all, i haven't had any problems with helio. <br>  <br>  fyi, helio uses sprint's signal (whatever you call it), so wherever sprint has signal, helio too has.|`|QAOU7TF3aa	if u dont wanna pay alot go with Helio..its completely better...i switched from verizon to Helio and wow it is wayyyy better...plus the ocean is the best phone..|`|h2eiAPxtaa	I would say the Verizon plan would be better.  You get service in most places, and it is very reliable.  Helio is not that old so they may not be reliable.
E8kD3w3Oaa	While the phone is a little bigger than others, it'll fit in a male pocket just fine. Girls with tighter jeans, it becomes an issue.<br>  <br>  But yeah, it's pocket sized. You can head to most GameStop retailers to see the Ocean in person. Yeah, they sell Helio phones there now.|`|QAOU7TF3aa	the Ocean isnt as big as u think...smaller than the sidekick and it fits great in your pocket...if u wear normal size pants...not like rocker or nething..

The original game is only 7~8 gigs, and the expansion pack adds another 2gigs.  There are a lot of patches, but there aren't 10 gigs worth. :)|`|9DBtNQNuaa	yep try the 10 day trial see if u like it. If u do go to target and buy the full game until you  get to 60 then buy the buening crusade|`|hhWFv1Oyaa	Buy World of WarCraft at GameStop.Huk it up on you're computer and make an id and start playing.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The 10 day trial is just that, a trial.  You can't upgrade it with a subscription.  You'll have to go to the store and buy the actual game because it contains the CD-Key that will link your account to that CD-Key.  It's to prevent software piracy.  <br>  <br>  The Burning Crusade is an expansion back.  Basically, it allows you to play as 2 new races (Blood Elves and Draenei), and classes that were specific to each side is no longer exclusive (Horde can play as Paladins, and Alliance can play as shamans).  The max level is also raised by 10, so you can achieve level 70.

Se fosse un DVD RECORDER la cosa sarebbe molto più semplice.<br>  <br>  Devi cominciare a considerare i comandi del videoregistratore a cassette:<br>  <br>  1-accensione generale<br>  2-attivazione del comando abilitazione alla registrazione<br>  3- immediatamente dopo il comando di avvio<br>  4-attivazione comando di stop con attesa della chiusura della cassetta<br>  5 spegnimento del registratore.<br>  <br>  ---------------------<br>  A parte il sequenziatore per questi comandi, il difficile è farli fare al registratore:<br>  <br>  Ci sono due modi<br>  1-''entrare dentro il registratore'' cosa del tutto sconsigliabile dato che non si trovano gli schemi e all'interno è un casino.<br>  <br>  2-agire sul telecomando posizionato in posizione strategica.<br>  A questo punto si possono seguire due vie:<br>  3-aprire il telecomando, saldare fili sui contatti della tastiera<br>  che ti servono come sopra detto collegarli ai contatti normalmente aperti di relè, e comandare i relè nella opportuna sequenza. (vantaggi:attivazione diretta dei comandi)(svantaggi: il telecomando è un oggetto delicato, se lo rompi poi butti telecomando e videoregistratore; inoltre l'integrato del telecomando è un integrato C-MOS sensibilissimo alle scariche elettrostatiche e si rischia di fotterlo solo facendo le saldature)<br>  <br>  4- agire sul telecomando azionando i vari tasti per via elettromeccanica SENZA aprirlo.C'è la complicazione della costruzione della meccanica e trovare i solenoidi per comandare i tasti.<br>  -----------------------------------<br>  Tanti, troppi anni fa (40) feci una costruzione del genere per comandare uno dei primi registratori a cassette della Philips per registrare elettrocardiogrammi, ma avevo a disposizione il committente che era una officina meccanica di precisione.<br>  Il tutto funzionò egregiamente e ci vollero  più di tre mesi per realizzare il tutto.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Se esistono aggeggi del genere già fatti, compralo,mai costruire quello che è gia disponibile anche se costa.

XanSl356aa	The Cif video gives a resolution of 352 × 288 in the captured videos while the vga gives 640x480 resolution<br>  Obviously a video of a higher resolution gives better details.|`|09b5eb8f220e4aa6cc6a529e8b913270aa	The term VGA is often used to refer to a resolution of 640×480, regardless of the hardware that produces the picture (even though this resolution is outdated in PC, in the pocket PC / PDA market it is currently becoming the standard). It may also refer to the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector which is still widely used to carry analog video signals of all resolutions.<br>  <br>  The VGA specifications are as follows:<br>  <br>  256 KiB Video RAM <br>  16-color and 256-color modes <br>  262144-value color palette (six bits each for red, green, and blue) <br>  Selectable 25 MHz or 28 MHz master clock <br>  Maximum of 720 horizontal pixels <br>  Maximum of 480 lines <br>  Refresh rates at up to 70 Hz <br>  Vertical Blanking interrupt (Not all cards support this.) <br>  Planar mode: up to 16 colors (4 bit planes) <br>  Packed-pixel mode: 256 colors (Mode 13h) <br>  Hardware smooth scrolling support <br>  Some "Raster Ops" support <br>  Barrel shifter <br>  Split screen support <br>  Soft fonts <br>  The VGA supports both All Points Addressable graphics modes, and alphanumeric text modes. Standard graphics modes are<br>  <br>  640×480 in 16 colors <br>  640×350 in 16 colors <br>  320×200 in 16 colors <br>  320×200 in 256 colors (Mode 13h) <br>  As well as the standard modes, VGA can be configured to emulate many of the modes of its predecessors (EGA, CGA, and MDA).<br>  <br>  CIF (Common Intermediate Format) is used to standardize the horizontal and vertical resolutions in pixels of YCbCr sequences in video signals. It was designed to be easy to convert to PAL or NTSC standards. It was first proposed in the H.261 standard. It defines a video sequence with a resolution of 352×288, a framerate of 30000/1001 (roughly 29.97) fps, with colour encoded using YCbCr 4:2:0.<br>  <br>  QCIF means "Quarter CIF". To have one fourth of the area as "quarter" implies, height and width of the frame are halved.<br>  <br>  Terms also used are SQCIF (Sub Quarter CIF), 4CIF (4× CIF) and 16CIF (16× CIF). The resolutions for all of these formats are summarized in the table below.<br>  <br>  Format Video Resolution <br>  SQCIF 128 × 96 <br>  QCIF 176 × 144 <br>  CIF 352 × 288 <br>  4CIF 704 × 576 <br>  16CIF 1408 × 1152 <br>  <br>  All xCIF formats result in an image of aspect ratio 4:3, hence the xCIF pixels are NOT square! On a computer screen (with square pixels) xCIF pictures have to be stretched for a resulting aspect ratio of 4:3. To correctly display CIF content on a computer screen, the CIF content must be stretched horizontally by ~9% to 384 x 288.<br>  <br>  The VGA format is better. $

DnWsMhwLaa	i know some things... where to start though? <br>  <br>  are you doing software multitracking or hardware multitracking?<br>  <br>  most of my experience is with software multitracking... if that is what you are doing what software are you using? what are you using to input to your computer? are you doing an isolated part by part multitracking, or are you doing the whole band at once? do you have any more specific questions or are you just wanting to try to do some recording and dont know where to start?<br>  <br>  when i first started doing it, a friend of mine had cakewalk and let me install it. i had no instructions and i just kind of figured a bunch out through trial and error mainly. when i listen to my first recordings- they are intollerable, i was using one of those sh!tty 10 dollar computer mics and didnt know how to do anything, the background buzz is so loud, somehow there is both level clipping and the recording level seems low... than i got a better mic, and still another better mic, and then a better sound card, and slowly learned how to edit with the software, and than still another mic upgrade etc... it was really a process for me... an ongoing one..|`|FUwnW9Mtaa	A good entry level is the Audacity freeware. You can play back a track and add numerous layers. Each layer can be tweaked. Parts taken out.Effects added. The only complicated part is when you want to save a project. Audacity will export it as a WAV file. I run the file through a WAV to mp3 converter and then send it(my main site is on The Flatpickers Hangout).<br>  Of course when you've gotten pretty comfortable with technique there's all kinds of expensive software like Cakewalk and Native Instruments.

You could 1, purchase online, but I don't recommendd this unless you live far away from from a provider.  Or 2, you could go into town and purchase at any gaming- electronics store.  By doing this you can check out best buy, gamestop, wall-mart, etc.  If your looking to buy one for $300 you probally know that this is usually the 360 pro.  All the stores above run 360's at this price.  If your wanting an elete, there $400 and you get double the memory.  Or if you want the cheapest, you can get an arcade.  All stores will usually run them the same if they've been out for a while.  There are also bundles you can buy that give you extra games.  The main 360s can be found at this address:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=abcat0701001&type=category" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a>|`|6srJbS6Vaa	Please look Xbox 360 at Amazon.

xTioPxaVaa	Cables and connectors have always been the weak link in any audio system.<br>  <br>  Your problem is either in the guitar itself, the amp itself, or the cable connecting the two.  To troubleshoot this, you have to eliminate what is working in the system to figure out what is broke.<br>  <br>  Did your guitar and amp work at one time?  If so, then the cable might be at fault.  Try this to rule it out:<br>  <br>  Plug the cable into the amp and turn it up about 1/3 of the way.  Now, touch the point on the other end of the cable with your finger (you're not going to get shocked).  You should hear a loud buzz coming through the amp.  If you do, then the cable and amp are working, and the problem is in the guitar.  If not, then it's either the cable or the amp itself.<br>  <br>  At that point, I'd try a different cable (you should always carry a spare anyway.  I like Planet Waves cables these days...well constructed and not a lot of money).<br>  <br>  If you're still not back in business, try your guitar with another amp just to make sure it's not the cause.  If it works, then the culprit is the amp.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken

to6ApMB2aa	In laymans terms..<br>  HDMI is just a cable standard for connecting your tv to things. It's the easiest way of connecting a DVD player or Blu-ray player to your tv since both the sound and the picture come through it so you only need one cable for the hookup.<br>  There are some other details dealing with digital rights managements and other things that you don't need to know. Main thing for you is it will give you the clearest picture with the easiest hookup.|`|p1dcw35Qaa	It's a digital connection that has the video and audio signals in it. In order to see true HD, you need to get an HD cable box with digital service. The cable box will have an hdmi output that you would simply plug in to the TVs hdmi input. Don't waste a lot of money on cables in retail stores, buy them online and you'll save big. I like monoprice.com but there are many others.

d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	jailbreak on a windows computer, here's what i did:<br>  I performed a successful tethered jailbreak on my ipod touch 2G one month ago using the RedSn0w tool for windows 32 bit, and I have used Cydia and Installer flawlessly. I rebooted or turned off the ipod a few times since (just to see it was possible), and everything is going great. Here is the site of the guide I used:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/gui-jailbreaking-ipod-touch-2nd-gen-application-for-windows-released/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  This is the best GUI method out there, and really easy and quick (I used codename: Cynw00d). Follow the instructions carefully, and you should be set. The links of where to download the app are there. But you'll need the firmware ipsw file its self. I used the latest version of firmware for the ipod touch (5H11a) and it works great. Here is a trustworthy site where I always get my ipod touch firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  So thats it! Thats all you need to know! I will say this, there is this one step in the app where you need to select the firmware that you will patch to jailbreak. The first time I did this, I didn't highlight it. Everything wil seem okay, but a later step won't work. So don't forget to highlight the firmware you wish to use for the jailbreak when the app asks you!<br>  <br>  ~ilz|`|u3YvK5C2aa	Yes u can|`|Ucy15Q8Haa	yes you can but it is a little more complex than the jailbreak for the first generation.

Questi ultimi 2 sono pensati proprio per la visione dei video, più che per ascoltare musica.. ma leggono anche gli mp3 :)<br>  Infine, proprio per essere pignola, anche lo zen v plus legge i video ma lo schermo è talmente piccolo che non ne vale la pena. <br>  Io tra quelli che ho elencato suggerisco lo Zen Vision M.

L69pNvIgaa	Yes.  The charge for unlimited internet is $30 a month.  The BlackJack 2 is a "PDA" phone according to at&t, and so it requires a "PDA" data plan which is $30 bucks a month.<br>  <br>  Texting is separate, and is not included.  Texting packages are as follows:<br>  $5 = 200 Messages (in and out)<br>  $15 = 1500 Messages (in and out)<br>  $20 = Unlimited Messages (in and out)<br>  <br>  So to get unlimited internet and texting, you're looking at an additional $50 a month.|`|gpkrbRepaa	Yes, but you have to have a data plan and yes, AT&T does.

5db72ce35d2d782f3363e50d412fc3b3aa	You are pretty much screwed.Well there is some cd repair you could buy and try that. but it is not guaranteed to work. So you would be better off buying a new game.
FUwnW9Mtaa	It's the formats.Do some research on CNet. Limewire installs some product protection which creates anomalies when transferring to Zune or IPod.
RpCwfcRzaa	Yes as long as you are replacing it with an official 360 hard drive, you can swap the info using the data transfer cable (which comes with the 120 GB hard drive) or a memory card.|`|LaVzFeLmaa	Yes. Sort of.<br>  <br>  The 120GB hard drive comes with a cable that attaches to the old hard drive to allow you to transfer data.<br>  <br>  Other than that, though, no, not without a memory card.|`|Z2HTjHlRaa	yes, using the data migration kit that comes with a 120 gb hard drive but if you don not have this one, you can actually get or redownload the premium contents using your gamertag but for the game progresses, it will not be transferred and contents that you had offline
KNYF1hnhaa	Yes you can.  The iPhone is a computer with a phone feature in it so it can get viruses just like a computer can.|`|AA11539218	Not likely as the iphone uses different operation languages...for the virus to affect you phone it would have to be specifically written for it.|`|5b5gOsIJaa	yeah maybe so be careful

mZlPj8Guaa	There are several phones out there that will be equal to what you have now. BUT, let's say you want to start to text. Go with the LG EnV which will be a nice upgrade. LG Omnia is a fantastic camera phone.<br>  <br>  The LG Voyager is what I am currently looking at as I am going to upgrade too. I do not text as much because I hate the fact I do not have a qwerty keyboard (I have a Chocolate now, I hate the thing).

JuTvkKwqaa	Contrary to what one of the other responsers said, you can't just "call up and get a new one for free".  The warranty (1 year) has to be in effect, and I think you have to be the original owner.  360's have gone down in price to the point where repair costs to you would be almost as much as a new one.<br>  <br>  You can get a brand new XBox for $200, and get the warranty, but granted you won't get the games and accesories.  Plus I believe they're made better now.  The older ones are atrociously unreliable.  <br>  <br>  One thing is for certain.  If you decide to buy it, make sure you try it first.  That's not enough to guarantee it works perfectly, but it will be enough to tell you if it's RROD'd.|`|1ba35ec7e93aaa821e445b327be71a85aa	Might be affected by ring of death maybe|`|242b5d3463143055c75676eb351f96e2aa	See it in action first. The red rings warranty only counts for the original owner.|`|zCdh8R6Haa	That sounds like a great deal. I bought a used xbox 360 off of ebay about 3 years ago. it broke after about 2 years due to the rings of death but you can just call in and get a new one for free... but about 1 month of waiting for a new one. it depends how it broke but most of the time when they break the rings of death pop up and you can get a new one for free
6GIrW5eWaa	If you are currently connected to xbox live via a cable (direct) and everything is working Keep it the same. If there is some reason why you "have" to do this there are less expensive alternatives out there.|`|hyo4tWv9aa	it only means that u dont need a cable to connect to live. not worth it...... 100buxs too expensive stick to eternet cable.|`|XdtS0Mrzaa	You can run the ethernet cable directly to your xbox if the cable is close by, but if your cable (where ever it comes into the house at) is further away from where you have your xbox, you should consider the adapter.<br>  <br>  If you already have a wireless modem (aka surfboard, etc) like for laptops of multiple home computers, and your xbox is not near that modem, go wireless adapter.<br>  <br>  My xbox has one because the modem is on the other side of the house, and it works great and has never lost signal, even after a power outage. its a little pricey but so are ethernet extension cables.<br>  <br>  The adapter is best for a distanced modem, unless you want a cable running across the house.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped =)
HekFanRvaa	it should be ok, but if you have a DVD player, save your PS2 from added wear and tear. The part that gets broken easily with continous use is the laser reader which costs almost as much as a brand new PS2. So, it is ok to use it but if have have any alternative, go for the alternative.|`|YI8V5e36aa	Nope not at all ;)
sYZ6IPWjaa	Both devices can retrieve e-mail just fine, so either one would work.|`|e9d744730c1945534ece9c6d73f61f0eaa	Honestly, the iPhone is cool, but I would go with the Blackberry. I haven't used the storm, but I know that the iPhone isn't as good as it is made to sound. My brother has the older one and it works just fine and has a ton of cool features but on top of the $400 price tag on it, they charge like $35/month just for the multimedia stuff. The newer iPhones are cheaper, but they are asking like $45/month instead so all of that quickly adds up. My dad has the Blackberry Curve and it is an awesome phone and works amazingly for e-mail, so I would look into the Blackberry.|`|4cMuedpWaa	I used the iPhone 3G for over 6 months and loved the email application, never had a problem with it and it was pretty fast and real-time.<br>  <br>  I also have a Blackberry Bold and a Blackberry 8900.<br>  <br>  My only problem with the Blackberry is that I can only setup max 10 email accounts via the BIS where with the iPhone I setup the accounts (as many as I want) on the phone with IMAP and I can get all the emails in real time and I can still add more mailboxes.<br>  <br>  I would steer away from the Storm though. I truly believe it's not yet ready like the iPhone and that's why I tried it and I decided to go for the Bold and the 8900, much better.|`|ccPRyYKzaa	I have the Blackberry Storm and I don't like it, but it's good for emails. But if you email constantly then don't get it because your fingers will start to hurt.|`|VFYUhbzSaa	blackberry storm my mom loves hers|`|d53507ff674901cfc353ab962084cae7aa	Blackberry storm, i-phone or what else?|`|BXGkQUu0aa	I would give the Storm a test drive before purchasing it - it is very difficult to type on (that's been my personal experience).

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	I have an OLD Sony clock radio, which dates back to sometime in the 70's. It is a combination analog/digital in that it has wheels with numbers which turn instead of hands, It has an adjustment which will set the snooze delay from 5 minutes to as long as 30 minutes. I have it set for 15 minutes. The snooze feature is a one-shot, unlike any other snooze button I've seen, in that when you press the button, it silences the buzzer, but it only works once. And it only works ion the buzzer, not the radio. No second snooze. 15 minutes later the buzzer goes again and the only way to silence it is to turn the alarm to the OFF position. I have never seen a one-time snooze button in any other alarm clock or clock radio. The snooze adjustment also works with the radio portion, which sets how early the radio goes on before the buzzer sounds. So, if I set the buzzer for 6 AM, the radio switches on 15 minutes before the buzzer. Most days, I wake up when the radio switch clicks and if I had it set to do so, would turn on the radio.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	isnt the whole idea is to get you up and moving in that time period...NOT going back to sleep...check your clock..most have a setup where when you snooze goes off and you hit the button it will give another 10 minutes..check the directions
DWBN7wDbaa	I have been using P2P programs for over 5 years now, and I highly suggest not using limewire. I can also say that WinMX is still by far the best one out of all of them. The original owners gave up on WinMX, and the community came together and got it back up. And now it has more features than before.<br>  <br>  Unlike Limewire, WinMX protects you from the RIAA/MPAA by blocking them from even getting on the network, it removes all fake files from your search results so you never get fake files, and it's fast and easy to use and NO SPYWARE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patchwinmx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.patchwinmx.com</a>|`|w2Wvjs1qaa	it is a free music site but try this website:<br>  <br>  frostwire.com<br>  <br>  it has less viruses.|`|gkWizapuaa	yes you can you can download movies pic songs and lots of others things its also free and easy to get you just type in limewire.com in your search engine and download it|`|FMb9AEdGaa	you can download free music.FREE movies pics everything is free

4G41Z3RJaa	I was pretty sure so I Googled "handset shoulder rest", I found a number of sites including eBay.<br>  <br>  However I would suggest that if you are going to use it a lot, that it will cause problems with your neck and shoulders up to and including bad headaches.  Look into getting a head set, I bought one at "The Source".  The end was a mini-jack - not the best for a telephone, so I also purchased a headset handset switch.  You unplug the handset at the phone, plug in the cord attached to the switch, then plug the handset into the switch and the headset.  It uses a couple of batteries, but you can mute, and there is a hearing volume control, and fits well over the head.  The bonus is the there is no possibility of a sore neck, the con is that it is more expensive.

Past experience i saw other engineers pocketing the cash or having a cheque made out to their name which is wrong and any future problems wont be covered by Sky's warranty|`|ca45a20110b39435a05dfafc8745bf11aa	I don't know the answer to your question, but I can tell you about our experience with Sky fitters. <br>  They are on piece-work, meaning that the more installations they can complete in a day, the more they get paid. Not their fault, I know, but it doesn't encourage careful workmanship. Our fitter wanted to drill a hole through a FLAT ROOF to get the job done. So I don't fancy your chances for  getting a pole safely erected. And if it was to fall on somebody...well...you would be liable of course.|`|PeE2y9hdaa	When we had Sky+ HD installed they would not use our old dish as it was on the wall above our garage and they are no longer allowed to climb over a certain height. They tried fitting a new one to the side of our garage but it was too low so they fitted an angled pole. No extra charge.
