20090226193432AA9e1hS	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What Do You Think About This Situation?	I purchased a used vehicle over a month ago.  Put down a $1,K down payment, was told that he financing was secure, signed all the papers and took delivery of the vehicle.  The next day, I went to the dmv and registered  the  vehicle in my name. About a week later, I was called by the dealership and was told that more references were needed from me as they couldn't get in touch with the ones I provided. About a week went, by and I was contacted by the dealership informing me that my proof of income wasn't enough and they needed a bank statement showing where my paycheck is direct deposited.  Then the next I was told that the finance company had everything they needed other than when they called to verify my employment it showed that the number they called was not a land line.  My first payment isn't due until March 12 and when I called the finance company, they couldn't even find a loan in my name.  My question is this, who owns the vehicle? Do I own it since it is insured and registered in my name or does the dealership still own it?

I have a 2001 Pontiac Grand Am and today I when I was coming home I drove under a bridge. The bridge had a little water under it but drove under anyway. My car stopped working but after three cranks I got it to work fine and now its driving again. I drove home which was pretty far from where i was under the bridge at.      I was wondering if I let my car just get and dry for the rest of the night will it be ok. Since i was able to crank the engine again and get everything working. When I accelerate it starts to make a funny noise and when I'm idling it jumps around a bit but other than that I haven't had any problems.

20090226200118AAxsqli	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Weird careless driving without accident?	My question involves a careless driving ticket from the State of: PA      I got a careless driving ticket two weeks ago and I do not think I was driving carelessly. This is my first ticket and I do need any comments/suggestions/tips to help me fight it. Here is my story.      I am a female at the age of around 30. The other late night, between 11pm to 12am I think, I was driving on campus with two friends sitting in my car. It was snowing mixed with raining, not heavy. The temperature was about 32F. But since the precipitation lasted through the whole night (and sometimes in the daytime) the road was covered with snow, ice, and water. I drove slowly (under 30 mph) and very carefully since the road was slippery. There were very few cars on the road. I was stopped by a cop who gave me a ticket for careless driving. The statement he wrote on the citation was "def was traveling into the opposing lane with disregard for the oncoming traffic". According to what he said, he was traveling to the opposite direction (toward me) and I traveled into his lane and ALMOST crashed his car. I definitely did not think I was so close to any oncoming cars. And there were two facts: 1) He did not horn me; if I made him in such a dangerous situation, at least naturally he should horn me to avoid a crash; 2) He did pass by me, made a U-turn, and followed me. The road is a 2-lane road, one for each direction, and there is NO dividing middle line in the portion where he said I "was traveling into the opposing lane".      In addition to the possibility that the bad weather and road condition led to his misjudgement, I think there was another possibility. I do not know the exact position where he was when he judged me traveling into his lane. But it is not totally impossible that he was at the higher part of the road and I was at the lower part, and the lower part was kind of curved to the right when facing it from the higher position. In the snowing/raining dark night, this could also contribute to a misjudgement on my exact position on the road.      I do not have any court experience. I do not know what is the point I should focus on -- I was not careless or he misjudged.      I appreciate any help!
20090226200138AApLMAg	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I hit a parked car last night?	I was backing up and I rubbed up against another car in the parking lot while going maybe 5 mph.  When I got out my jeep had no damage, just a little scuffing on the plastic part of the wheel well (it rubbed right off).  The other car, a Xterra, had the same scuffs on the plastic of the wheel well but, it also had a golf ball sized dent a 6 or so inches higher up on the actual metal part.   I'm almost positive it was there before I hit it, but I'm not sure.       Anyways, I left the a note with my name and number just in case.  Now, I'm a little worried because if that dent was there before I hit the car the other person could have said I did it and because I didn't call the police I may have to pay for that extra dent.        Any suggestions?

When it was my turn I checked traffic and the light turned green so I made my turn, as soon as I turned I saw a car that I'm assuming turned before me hit the brakes for no reason and I rear ended her.  She insisted on no insurance and wanted ot get  acheap estimate.  How ever yesterday I decided to report it to insurance becuase I didn't trust her and she seemed shady.  She wrote me a letter over a week ago requesting $656 and told the police at the scene she was fine now that I reported it to insurance she all the sudden has bodily injury?  I know shes a fraud will my insurance be able to prove this?  The impact was so light it only left a small crack in both our bumpers and it wasn't enough to even jolt me.

20090226201709AA43Fb7	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Is $500 reasonable for a '92 Ford Explorer in good condition?	One of my coworkers is getting rid of a '92 Ford Explorer.  The people that owned it before him put a new transmission and engine in it, and it has since gotten about 100,000 miles on it. The previous owners had also wrecked the front end, which left the front suspension slightly shifted to one side. My coworker says he can get the front differential for $150 and that he would charge about $150 to replace it. Other than that and possibly needing a tune up/oil change (which I can do myself), he says it's in pretty good condition, including the body. Does $500 (plus the $300 for parts/labor) seem reasonable? It is a 4-door, 4WD, and has a V6 4.0 L in it. It also has a CD player. I work at an auto parts retailer but am still learning a good bit about cars, so any feedback would be helpful. Thanks!

20090226205627AA3VTP4	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car doesnt start because of battery drainage. Any clues?	I got my car serviced but then had to leave it idle for about 3 days. After that when I try to start the car it seems that the battery has drained out so it wouldnt start. I got someone to push the car and started it. Then drove for about 20 mins. Then if I try to turn off the car and then try to start again it does start. However, if I leave it idle for any more than an hour the battery again drains off and the car doesnt start.      Can anyone tell me if the battery is dead or if there is a chance that the wiring is screwed up. Also, I did not have this problem before servicing so that tells me maybe the wiring is screwed up. However the battery does retain charge for some time (less than an hour) after driving so it might still be the battery.

I'm not to good on the prices, I know I can go get it appraised but it's probably 7 PM and I want to know now so.   I have a...   1962 Chevrolet BelAir    409 V8   4 On The Floor   It has Original Paint and original interior.   The paint is perfect, a little faded from the years and the interior is PERFECT, no tears or anything, there is a minor scratch thats un-noticeable unless you open the door and look.   The exterior is perfect, NO rust at ALL. None. No where. Not under it, floor boards, trunk, no where. It has a small dent thats easily popped out, but you cant notice it unless your looking for it. It has 33,000 miles on it, it was never re-built, but probably tuned up and stuff back in the 70's when it was driven. I found the car in an old gas station garage in the back. It was hung up there in 1977 because of a cracked windsheild, and the owner never fixed it, because it was hardly ever driven in the first place. I bought it 2 weeks ago, it was almost to good to be true, but then I remind myself it's not an Impala SS its just a Bel-Air, I know matching anything is worth money, but want to be sure or double check. The car runs FANTASTIC, like brand new, it started up the day the owner moved it out of the garage, I bought it 3 minutes later probably. Only defects are EASILY fixed. Dent, Scratch on Interior, SLIGHTLY faded paint, not noticable unless your looking at a shiny new 1962 Bel-Air, and a crack window, which amazingly I found one forsale in Oregon and Im picking that up soon. So tell me what you think it's worth, thanks.

I know my shocks/struts are bad because it's like driving a boat.  Could those guys be responsible for the shaking as well?  Could it be alignment?

It is old and has a few quirks, but is a great car overall, I like it more than my bmw m3.  I wonder though, with the high mileage and all, how does a car in theory "die"?  What would stop my engine from running forever?  Or better yet...how could I keep this engine running for a lot longer?  At any rate, should the engine give out (it is still running strong) I could always replace it, lol.

I have found a car that requires a small down payment and is worth the 7,500 dollars they are asking. THe only problem is that I need a co-signer for the car. My father can not do this because his credit is not good. I amonly 18 so i am trying to establish credit but I only have a gas card so much luck with that. I am very responsible and independent. If i find a cosigner on here I am willing to write out a notorized letter saying that legal action can be taken against me if I do not come up with payments. So if you or someone you know with good credit is willing to co-sign for me it will be soooo greatly appriceated and if it helps any the car will be getting paid off in March of 2007.

20090225124002AAnHjsZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Can a transmission oil cooler cool too much?	I have a 1995 Ford Taurus with 182,000 miles and am looking at adding a transmission oil cooler (it is my understanding that cooler oil can mean longer transmission life, and for $50, why not). The car is in northern California where most of the time it is between 50 and 85 degrees F. A couple questions:      1) Is is possible that the new cooler could cool too much and mess with the proper operation of the transmission?      2) I drive only on highways about 22,000 miles a year. The way I see it the car is getting decent cooling at high speeds on the highway, so is it even worth it to add the cooler at all?       I have scoured forums and haven't found too much. I'm hoping to get some solid answers here. Thanks in advance for your time.
