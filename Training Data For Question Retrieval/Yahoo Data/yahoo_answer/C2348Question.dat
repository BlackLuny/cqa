Please help this is a school assignment, i hate English and i suck at ti and history i work better with number but nay ways can you please tell me if this is good and any thing should be changed?   ______________________________________...         When the bell rang at 1.45 I was already in the hall way s running toward the parking lot, cussing and pushing anyone who is standing in my way so I can get to my car soon and leave before the parking lot gets packed. I have been like this for the past three days so I can go home before 2.00pm to check the mail before my mom did.     I failed two classes, and every time someone fails a class the school sends a letter home to let the parents know about it.  My mom leaves for work at 2.10, and every day five minutes before she leave she checks the mail. I had to get my hands on that letter before she did so I can get rid of it. She cannot find out about it, because I gave her my report card few days ago, and on it I had two A’s two B’s and a C so it looks believable. Good thing I paid attention in the graphic design class I took last year.  With the stuff I learned there and a bootleg version of Photoshop I have been making fake report cards for a while now and she haven’t caught me yet.     Just when the mail man left my house I pulled into my drive way. I ran to the mail box , and I started to go through the mail. And finally there it was the letter from school; I put the other letters aside, my pockets were full so I had to hide in my pants. And when I turn around to run back into the house my mom was standing behind me. She smiled and asked “what was that”, I had no choice but to give her the letter, knowing that as soon as she reads it I was going to be in a lot of trouble and the usual kiss and “mom I promise I’ll do better next time” won’t work this time.

I had already applied last year and was accepted, but could not go due to money problems. So I stayed home this year, worked on an art portfolio and re-applied. Should I include this in my statement. Or just why I want to study in this school. Will adding personal things help me obtain a scholar ship.

20090304160647AAVfoKk	Education & Reference;Teaching	Teacher lost my test!!!?	My Spanish teacher lost my test and she won't let me make it up let alone do anything about it.        She sees it as my fault, saying that I probably took it home by accident after the test as the reason why I never turn it in and thus why she does not have it.....I am absolutely sure this is not true: I don't throw anything out until the semester ends meaning EVERYTHING should be in my binder or whatever.  I even looked in my folders from last semster for every class - not there.      So the only thing left is that SHE lost it!  She refuses to acknowledge that and says that she has never lost a test before.  Right now I have a zero for that test and I'm afraid this will be what's keeping me from an A in this class.      I've talked to my guidance counselor, who said I should talk to her again but if she still won't do anything the guidance counselor will talk with the assistant principle....Is it worth it to bring the assistant principle in?       I won't be having her for any classes next year...but I'm scared this might affect my grade in the following weeks until June...especially since she also counts participation (which is graded VERY subjectively based on her opinion of each student).      What should I do?

College is coming up in like 2 years and I knwo I sound like a paranoid freak but... my friend is graduating this spring and I'm a sophmore... I was thinking about what colleges I want to go to: Southern Wesleyan University- maybe (is it a good school?) , Emory, Oxford, UGA.... these are really the colleges I want to go to. But I screwed up with A's B'a C's and D's freshman year and last semester. Currently I'm doing a good job of maintaining all A's and B's. I'm taking an AP course, 2 next year, and maybe 4 senior year. I'm in Key Club, SADD, and I'm going to start doing volunteer working at a hospital. I know I sucked in the beginning but I'm trying hard now and it's working! Doesn't that count for something? Please help me? The SWU said I had a good chance of getting in b/c their lowest GPA that they accept is 2.5 and my GPAs are generally higher than that. SO any tips? Which colleges can I and can't I get accepted into?

I'm currently taking separate sciences for GCSE this year (I'm doing it as a one year course in year 11) and I achieved A*s in Biology and Physics and was 2 marks off an A* in Chemistry, only I think I did really badly in the real exam in January that accounts for 1/3 of my final mark. I really want to retake the exams and on the OCR website it says you can for free if notified up to 2 weeks after results come through next week (even then retakes are only ￡3 anyway) and only the best mark counts. My biology teacher said nobody has ever had to retake and the school would only consider if someone got below a C. I want to be a doctor when I'm older and am so stressed out over this. What can I do?

20090304165025AA51v7n	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I need speech suggestions :]?	“How Fame Causes Change Speech”      Introduction:   How many of you think being famous is fun and easy? In some cases it is, but in most it’s not.      I’m going to tell you about how 2 people changed due to fame, Kevin Federline and Chris Brown.      (Show picture)   Okay so, Kevin Federline, better known as K-Fed, changed in a positive way according to People-Magazine.com.   K-Fed started off as a back-up dancer for Justin Timberlake. While on tour, he met and soon married Britney Spears. Together, they had 2 kids. Soon Britney started to become irresponsible. K-Fed’s fans encouraged him to take charge. He divorced Britney, stopped being an alcoholic, and got custody of his kids. His fans made him realize that his kids were more important than being famous. They helped him become a more responsible father-figure.      Now, here’s another example of a celebrity whose life changed due to fame.   (Show picture)   Okay so this is Chris Brown, and he changed in a very negative way according to Star-Magaziner.com   Chris is 18 years old. He was discovered at age 16 as an R&B singer and a hip-hop dancer. He had millions and millions of fans, and he also had adults considering him a good role model for young men. Recently, Chris had an incident with former girlfriend Rihanna. Chris and Rihanna were in a car in a parking lot, when Rihanna was snooping through Chris’ phone and saw a text message from another girl. Rihanna was jealous and upset, so she threw his phone back at him. Suddenly, Chris attacked her.  (Show picture)   As you can see, this goes beyond a few slaps. He completely abused her. There are bruises, scars, scabs, cuts, and even bite marks all over he face.   Obviously now, Chris lost a whole lot of female and male fans. He is now one of the most disrespected young artists out there today.   Chris’ super-star ego and bad temper caused him to lose control. His fans turned him into an overly-confident and high-maintenance monster.         In conclusion, I’ve told you about how Kevin Federline and Chris Brown have changed due to fame and fan feedback. There is a lot of pressure when it comes to being a star, and being famous can either make you or break you. Now, how many of you still want to be famous when you’re older?            honest opinions please.
20090306163453AAxrMkj	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Does this make sense?? (content, grammar)?	Hello Mr Tadey.        I  got my worksheet 6 back from the toc today (it's friday and you weren't here.) and I have this  "L" sign on my paper..(maybe that's why you gave me a 3/4)      I'm guessing that means I handed it in late but i did not miss the due date. I handed in all my homework (Mind map, wkst 4,       and wkst 5).. on Feb 2nd.   You also wrote "in wrong class"  i have no idea what that means... Well my guess is that I'm always the first one to put my assignment in the yello box because I have accounting in period one (which is right across the hallway..) So as usual when the bell rang, I went there, submitted everytihng then went to the bathroom (I just checked and Feb 2nd was Monday, which means that we had a 10 min break).. While I was in the washroom, you probably collected whatever was in the yellow box and thought that they were from period 1.. I think that's what happened...

The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,        Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;        Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit        Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:        If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,        Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:        And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,        Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

I'm majoring currently in Computer Graphics Technology (with a focus on rigging, animation, modeling, and texturing, in other words -- 3D) and minoring in Computer Science.   If I'm lucky, I'll end up with my own game-design studio someday.      To fill some electives, and also just for my own benefit I'm looking to learn a new language ('already speak English and German). I'm looking at Chinese or Japanese as to what I'd start learning next semester.      I plan to become proficient (if not fluent) in whichever I choose.      I know a lot more about Japanese culture, and think I would enjoy learning the language, but I also know that China is more likely to have an highly prosperous economic future than Japan.

I just enrolled in local community college for the summer taking 9 units online, its a distant learning program they have available. I' am also planning to take 9 more units at a different community college that also has online classes that I need. Then 9 more units at a third community college, also online. All three of those colleges are around my area, and offer classes which are CSU and USC transferable. So that's 27 units, since all those classes are 3 units each. In fall I will be taken 33 units 15 in one college and 18 in another. Next spring I will be attending CSU taking 20 units, then returning summer for 9 more units, 20 more units in the fall and finishing up that spring with any credits left to go. I know its a lot of work for some, I went to school in Russia, throughout my child hood, and the amount of work I had to put in over there was 3 times more work than an average high school student in U.S , trust me on that. I went through 9 to 12 grade and it was like kindergarten we got to color U.S maps, it was ridicules, not to mention calculus they thought was same as I learned in 7th grade in Russia, they dint even teach theorems, I had to explain to the teacher why she got the problem wrong. :) I' am not trying to say that school here is a joke, I just want to point out that I' am well capable of taking on this task that most will find difficult. I want to know if this is allowed? I' am not interested in the socializing factor, I don' t enjoy parties very much, therefore not interested in socializing. I have that taken care of, I go to school to study not to act stupid.

OPTION 1: Journalism   Earn Master's Degree in Journalism (I got admitted last month)   Work as journalist: Television & Radio, in particular   Possibly teach journalism after a little while - maybe go for doctorate in Communications.    Pros: Fun job, POTENTIAL (although slim) for fame & fortune.    Cons: EXTREMELY EXTREMELY difficult. Most broadcast journalists work as audio editors, coffee getters, etc. You have to have a good "look" and "sound," for radio and TV and I am not sure if I am a good writer.       OPTION 2: TEACHER/LECTURER/WRITER   Earn Master of Science degree in Business and Marketing Education   Teach College-Level Business and Marketing   Join Speaker's Bureau and speak around the world on Business and Marketing topics   Write articles and books on Business and Marketing.    Pros: Fun, STABLE/STEADY work, unlike journalism.    Cons: Difficult to land initial teaching position (may be 5 years after grad school), no fame, no fortune, joining Speaker's Bureau is difficult.       ESSENTIALLY, I do not have the skill set (looks, voice, writing ability, talent) for any of the careers that I want to do.

I'm horrid at figuring these things out, thanks      "Terence, this is stupid stuff:   You eat your victuals fast enough;   There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,   To see the rate you drink your beer.   But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,   It gives a chap the belly-ache.   The cow, the old cow, she is dead;   It sleeps well, the horned head:   We poor lads, 'tis our turn now   To hear such tunes as killed the cow.   Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme   Your friends to death before their time   Moping melancholy mad:   Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."      Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,   There's brisker pipes than poetry.   Say, for what were hop-yards meant,   Or why was Burton built on Trent?   Oh many a peer of England brews   Livelier liquor than the Muse,   And malt does more than Milton can   To justify God's ways to man.   Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink   For fellows whom it hurts to think:   Look into the pewter pot   To see the world as the world's not.   And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:   The mischief is that 'twill not last.   Oh I have been to Ludlow fair   And left my necktie God knows where,   And carried half way home, or near,   Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:   Then the world seemed none so bad,   And I myself a sterling lad;   And down in lovely muck I've lain,   Happy till I woke again.   Then I saw the morning sky:   Heigho, the tale was all a lie;   The world, it was the old world yet,   I was I, my things were wet,   And nothing now remained to do   But begin the game anew.      Therefore, since the world has still   Much good, but much less good than ill,   And while the sun and moon endure   Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,   I'd face it as a wise man would,   And train for ill and not for good.   'Tis true, the stuff I bring for sale   Is not so brisk a brew as ale:   Out of a stem that scored the hand   I wrung it in a weary land.   But take it: if the smack is sour   The better for the embittered hour;   It will do good to heart and head   When your soul is in my soul's stead;   And I will friend you, if I may,   In the dark and cloudy day.      There was a king reigned in the East:   There, when kings will sit to feast,   They get their fill before they think   With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.   He gathered all that sprang to birth   From the many-venomed earth;   First a little, thence to more,   He sampled all her killing store;   And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,   Sate the king when healths went round.   They put arsenic in his meat   And stared aghast to watch him eat;   They poured strychnine in his cup   And shook to see him drink it up:   They shook, they stared as white's their shirt:   Them it was their poison hurt.   --I tell the tale that I heard told.   Mithridates, he died old.
20090306183720AAbVEPr	Education & Reference;Homework Help	So we have to write this essay..?	My teacher thought of the brilliant idea of making our essay's a partner assignment.   So me and my partner have to do this essay together. We decided that she would do the introduction. She emailed it to me, and I have to okay it. But I don't know if it is good.   The essay prompt is-- "Are laws neccessary to maintain a civil society?" We said yes.   This is what she wrote...      “Man perfected by society is the best of all animals; he is the most terrible of all when he lives without law, and without justice” (Aristotle).  Is there truth to those words? Laws are body of rules. Body of rules  inherent in human nature, established by the supposed authority. They are a prime example of a social mediator of relations between people. All in the name of civility, perhaps? In Aristotle’s mind, yes. Laws are necessary to maintain a civil society for the sake of humanity by avoiding anarchy, restricting the human nature of impulse and creating an allusion of what’s right.      What do you think?

I'm using quotes and referencing from Ray Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian', 'The Veldt' and possibly 'The Sound of Thunder'   Does anybody know if any of the things in these stories exist, or are being worked on?

20090306183751AAro0Rs	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I dorm at the University of Minnesota?	I will try to make this as short as possible.I am a  17 year old junior and I am in a government program that allows me to gain high school and college credits while I am at a college. So this year has been completely miserable for me, I have lost all of my friends besides two. Both of them live over forty minutes away so I barely get to hang out with them. I live about an hour north of Minneapolis, MN and it is in the middle of nowhere. Today, I was thinking that I could possibly transfer my thirty credits to the University of Minnesota and dorm there. I have a 4.0 so I do not think there would be a problem with me getting accepted. I think that I would have a much better life dorming. This whole year all I had in my life was my classes and my daily workouts.  So what do you guys think? If I dorm there will my age effect how many friends I can get?As long as my credits transfer completely I am positive that I will try anything to feel good again ha ha. Sorry for the long question and thanks in advance.
20090306164759AALMKxi	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Have I messed up too much to go to college?	I am in high school, in 10th grade. I'm very intelligent, but I've been extremely lazy and have slacked off in high school so far, therefore making poor grades. Last year in 9th grade for the first semester I made an A, B, B, C. In the second semester of that year I made a A, C, C, B. The first semester of this current year I made a A, B, C, C.   And this first six weeks of this new semester I have done extremely poorly, in fact making the worst grades I've ever made in school in my life. I'm going to fail two of the classes for the six weeks, but that's not the actual final class grade. The final class grade is found by adding the grades for each of the three six weeks plus the final exam. Each six weeks counts as 25% of the class grade, and this first six weeks I have done awful.   Does it sound to you like I have totally blown any chances of going to a University, even if it's just an average one? I don't want to go to a community college. Is it to late to turn it around and go to college?

Ok my story is about a wealthy, single, middle-aged guy who flies to Singapore just to take a break from his busy life in downtown New York City. His boss convinced him to stay with a lodging business out in the country called "Pleasant Escapes". He's told it's a perfect spot to go for a break, and after all, his company is paying. "Why not?" he tells himself.       Later in the story he gets a little suspicious. The children of the men and women that run the place are acting odd. Days later, he meets a older guy about 5 miles out in the valley nearby. He's supposed to be some kind of wise, future telling man that convinces the man, he can sense something wrong with the children too.

Detailed Info & my own thoughts on the topic: How many years of a foreign language is needed to get into a competitive college? By this I mean a college along the lines of University of Rochester, Boston College, Johns Hopkins, Vandy, Univ of Virginia, Univ of Notre Dame. So, realistically would I need 4 years of a foreign language for acceptance??? Most universities (that are like the ones listed above) say 2/3 years required; but more is recommended. But i doubt anyone gets in w/ only the minimum requirement? Is my assumption correct?      All my questions summed up:   How many years of a foreign language are needed to gain ACCEPTANCE into a competitive college?   Does a foreign language class you took in middle school/junior high count? (for example, if you took 1 year in middle school and 2 years in high school does a competitive college view this as having taken 2 or 3 years of a foreign language?)   Will colleges realize if you switch languages? Do they really have time to take note of this considering all the applicants they get? (for example, if you german for 9th and 10th and french for 11th and 12th would they realize this?)

20090306191653AAlmjBb	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Does the University of Pennsylvania accept SAT Math I scores?	Also, I've taken the SAT Chemistry test last year and received a 540. Should I retake it this year, or focus on the subjects that I have a better chance at getting a higher score?      As a side-note: Even though my science courses in school and on standardized tests aren't very good, I feel passionate about science and I want to major in the medical field in college.      Any advice, suggestions, or reviews?      The reason why I ask about SAT Math I is because I'm in IB Math SL at school (part one because I'm a junior) and we don't necessarily focus on Pre-calculus, it's more of a wider range of math with algebra and trigonometry.      Thanks!

20090227090002AAJYZAe	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Will not having taken AP Calc AB (in high school) affect my math college courses that much?	Okay, so high school senior here. I chose Calculus Hns this year instead of opting for AP Calc AB. At first I was confused which one to take, but my counselor stuck me into Hns for the time being and she said I could switch later if I wished to. And when the course started, i did feel Hns was too easy and tried to switch, but spots in AB were full.      So, now I'm in Hns right now, really regret not having taken AB.   What I'm curious about is how much this will affect my college math course selection options. Will I be able to jump right in to Calc II, or will I have to repeat Calc I all over again?   I heard some colleges do have a placement test, will I be able to get into Calc II if I pass it?   Also, I don't think I'd be ready enough to take the AP Calc AB test.   Don't think the Hns course prepared me well enough for it.      So, is this fine?   Thanks.

In case you guys have no idea where is the place, it is abut on Malaysia. One of the countries in ASEAN.      Ok, Singapore somehow is abit different from US. So i want to listen advice from US students especially the ones from California.      I have actually applied for CSUDH and Cal State Pomona. I researched for both school and presumed they are belong to middle-tier school (correct me if I'm wrong.) And they accepted students with GPA of 2.0 for CA residents, since I am international student which means I need at least 2.4 to get in. However, I know there are many clever and talented students out there waiting to get admit.      Now can you all please chance me. I do not have any SAT or standardized tests because back in Singapore, we are not required to take those tests.      My GPA is 2.461, in exact. This is not a GPA from HS. After HS, I went to Polytechnic and graduated with a Diploma. So this GPA is from the Poly. We do not use in GPA system in Secondary school. So I am wondering if there any differences between HS and Poly, although my GPA is out of 4.0 too.      Lastly, can you please chance me in getting in? I believe only 100++ international students able to admit.      Thanks!

20090227095619AAebFg8	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I'm torn between two choices --- making a difficult decision?	I'm sixteen and it's at this point where I have to decide what to do with my life. I'm doing my AS Levels and do like my subjects but I feel like I can't follow them through with anything as a career: Classical Civilisation, Photography, Philosophy and R.S. I plan to go to University.   I know most jobs just like a University degree but don't care what it is.   I don't like this openness of choices and I've looked at all the jobs I can do but absolutely none of them appeal to me. I look at them and think "no, I don't want do be a lawyer/banker/politician/&c." and then I get in a runt of there's nothing I want to do. This leads to a horrible lack of motivation (this does get to depression but I'm trying to get out of it). I want a path to follow, some aim/goal to get to careerwise because I don't see the point of doing a job unless you enjoy it. (Plus I know I can do those subjects as hobbies on the side.)   I got the point where I wanted to drop out of college but I know I can't do anything else so I have to fix this issue. Well I actually got to the point of thinking about suicide but I want to forget about that.   So I went back to when I wanted to do something and a year or so ago I really wanted to be a forensic pathologist. It really appealed to me. There are loads of reasons why I wanted to do it but I had a collapse in confidence and I didn't do the sciences for A Levels. I've decided to go back a year and do different A Levels (Human Biology, Maths,  Chemistry and continue one A2) so I could follow the Medical route.   Since then two things have popped up:   - Fear that I'll regret the change to sciences and think "I want to do Classics now" (because last night I read one of the plays we studied and I fell back in love with Classics), and   - That Medicine is really hard and I won't do very well.   I'm fairly smart (it's hard to evaluate myself on that...) and I've got what I need to do it and I know I can do well if I apply myself but I'm still really worried.   But I know I can't stay where I am because I get depressed easily with this lack of direction and if I do go for the forensic pathology job I'll have something to really go for.   The only other thing I have ever really liked is to be a writer, but I like that more for the writing itself than for getting it published. I don't want to follow this to a Creative Writing course or anything because I don't want to learn how to write. (note: I'm being as realistic as possible when it comes to this.)   My counselor says the openness is good because it allows me to grow but I don't want to get stuck in a job I won't enjoy (none of them interest me) which I think may happen if I go down that route.   That's pretty much it. I have to decide in about a week/two weeks. I'm not asking anybody to make my decision for me but perhaps another point of view will help me see the whole thing. I really love all the humanities (and art) but also being a forensic pathologist.   All advice is appreciated.   Thanks.      ^-^
