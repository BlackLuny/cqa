I made a simple wooden "crutch" to raise it a half-inch or so.  You might check the angle of that drain.

VFmmVHGVaa	Try using saddle soap,you should find it at any farm supply store.  t|`|BVJBY4eQaa	Using household products and 'old wives' remedies are very short sighted when it comes to cleaning and caring for leather and can become very costly in the long run as problems they generally cause will be costly to put right. (although it does keep people like ourselves busy as we rush round fixing problems caused by using the wrong things!!!)  Firstly check the type of leather you have so that you understand the results that are possible:  http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/whatkind...    You need to use a good quality water based foam leather cleaner. (LTT Leather Shampoo) With light coloured leather dye transfer from clothing can be a problem although using a good quality leather protector (LTT Leather Protect) will help inhibit this.     For dye transfer (which can be a real problem on pale coloured leathers) and ingrained dirt you may need a much stronger cleaner like Strong Cleaner or Maxi Cleaner (this should be used with caution)    DO NOT use anything containing oils, waxes or silicones. (Most 'conditioners' contain waxes or oils) and furniture polish (pledge) contains silicones which will eventually destroy the finish on the leather. Most car cleaners also contain oils or waxes so should not be used as they leave residues on the surface of the leather which attract more dirt which eventually leads to cracking.    BABY WIPES are the worst thing you can use as they will destroy the finish on your leather. This has been verified and proved to be the case. They are actually a very strong product and this is why they break down the finish. Leather is not like skin and should not be treated as such.    Saddle soap should never be usd on upholstery leather or garments it is meant for saddles which are very different from todays finished leathers.    A lot of leather wipes contain chemicals which will also destroy the finish or leave residues on the leather which will damage it. They are not cheap in the long run as you would need a lot to clean. A bottle of foam cleaner should do your car about 3-4 times.    Fairy liquid contains more salt these days to get dishes clean and this will break the finish down on your leather. This has been verified by the manufacturers (as with the baby wipes).    Magic Erasers should not be used unless you are going to renew the finish on you r leather. We have tested these recently and they sand away the top finish on the leather.    Lux flakes (although they used to be a good thing to use) now contain ingredients that will damage the finish on the leather and cause it to peel off like a skin (we have seen these happen hundreds of times at customers who have been ill advised by shops)    You should also follow cleaning with a good water based leather protector which will act like a 'scotchgard' and inhibit dirt and stains from being absorbed and make cleaning easier the next time. Conditioners are totally unnecessary and only a product push by manufacturers.    Dry leather needs rehydrating with water and oils and waxes should not be used as the natural oils do not dry out of leather. Wiping over with a damp cloth regularly will help to do this.     It is important to maintain a regular cleaning regime cleaning dirt off the surface regularly and inhibiting the absorption of body oils into the leather with a protector is the best way of doing this. The only 'moisturizer' a leather needs is from water.    The alternative is a brand new product on the market called Lazy Leather. This is the latest technology in cleaning and combines an effective cleaner with a protector. It is quick and easy to use and should be used as a maintenance product once your suite has been cleaned or from new if you have just bought it.    Using incorrect care products is usually the cause of deterioration in the leather as unfortunately most car care products contain waxes and oils or silicones which do not do the leather any good.    Further cleaning instructions and a care leaflet are avaialable here:  http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/freecare...    It has been proved that washing up liquid can damage the finish on the leather which is why it is not recommended, also conditioners will not do the leather any good and may cause damage. It is not always obvious what damage is being done until it is too late.
VFmmVHGVaa	The source of the odor may be coming from the cold air return vent ,check it and the area around it for the odor.  t|`|612784517a11e07e8241b0c92dfee6a6aa	Couple things could be check all the floor vents smell each one with the furnace running if only one has the smell its in the vent if all then the coils located behind the filter are dirty you can buy a spray can of foam cleaner to spray on them some times you can just brush them off but if its really bad use the foam spray any hardware store has it.
AfnOU04paa	Yes, it is very in style for young and older men alike.  Black is a versatile color.  It would look good with jeans or slacks, and with turtlenecks or crewnecks, or a shirt collar.  If you have pets at home, buy a clothes brush.|`|zAHeKvE1aa	Yea it looks pretty good. But it seems a bit snug fitting on the model.

But then again, if you have a 16 year old dishwasher then it could be a different story.  Why not just rinse them off?|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	Yes. If there is too much food left on the dishes that can not pass through the drain it will clog. I had this issue and my dishwasher flooded. It went into drain cycle but did not drain. Then it went to rinse but since it was still full of water it flooded my kitchen. So maybe not break your dishwasher but cause you a lot of headache and clean up.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	That is silly.  Putting really dirty dishes in a dishwasher means it may not be able to completely clean those dishes.  Then when it dries the dishes what is left on the dishes will be baked on.  Future batches will clean just as good as did the batches before you put the really dirty dishes in the dishwasher. If you have really dirty dishes you should pre rinse them first.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	As long as you scrape your plates off of excess foods you do not need to rinse before putting in the dishwasher and it will not break it. I have a higher end dishwasher and only have to scrape the food off, but never rinse the dishes. It always cleans the dishes spotless. It is well worth spending the extra money on a good quality dishwasher.|`|3WIcjCxkaa	Ummmm...No, but your dish won't come out clean if its that dirty.

AA11738981	If you have a cat, you are in luck! If you don't ?- just look in your pantry. You can use clay-type cat-box litter to absorb fresh oil stains. Sprinkle it on and then sort of crush it with your foot. Or, rub in with a broom and let it set a while. <br>  For those of you who don't have kitty litter handy, you can also try baking soda or even cornstarch ?- which are both very absorbent and will soak up a lot of oily stains. If needed, you can then pour some liquid laundry detergent on the area, scrub well with a good stiff brush and rinse off.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are commercial driveway cleaners at auto and home improvement stores, but I say let's try a home-style remedy first, which can be safer and cheaper. Then move on to the commercial products if necessary.|`|AA10391664	Bobsdidi has found a great solution.  Autoparts stores sell bags of oil absorbant for $10. A bag of clay kitty litter is $3.

Range varies by concrete mix and the additive used - I can't answer this for your exact situation.|`|08c5e9fdffb6e84a7d62863d9f29a17faa	While concrete cures, it warms itself... it is a chemical reaction and not a 'drying' process. If they toss some insulated tarps on the top, it will keep the heat in the concrete. If they close the door and put on a heater, this will work too.<br>  I have done concrete at -20C in Toronto and had it go fine using tarps (gas station apron around the pump islands for a large petroleum company)... Yes there is an additive you put in the mix to protect it from freezing by setting it off faster... an accelerant of sorts...<br>  <br>  When it doesn't work; it freezes... the top of the concrete freezes and will "spall" or flake off next spring... easy to check for though... see if the top of the concrete is "dry" or frozen...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|91d19aeb229e9dddf91fda17a6c96bf2aa	Everyone's talking about the concrete, the mix, etc.<br>  <br>  The real trick is making sure the ground doesn't have frost in it. Running a heater in the garage will not completely insure that the frost is out of the ground...<br>  <br>  Whoever is pouring the concrete will dig down in areas furthest away from the heater (heating it up several days before pouring the concrete) to test the ground.<br>  <br>  If you have a company pouring it make sure they're licensed and bonded... Most companies would have a clause in the contract stating their obligation to fix anything if anything went wrong and it would be at their expense.<br>  <br>  Heat must remain in the room for a few days to follow so the floor doesn't heave or swell... Which could happen if the frost isn't out of the ground before pouring.|`|f4bd20d82da5a97c8542a874533aae64aa	The cement company will use hot water in the batch and they'll add Calcium Chrolride to the mix.<br>  When the concrete is "Floated" out.

My garage is not heated and it has been colder than your area for over 24 hours. Its temperature was 34 this afternoon. It was 7 outside.<br>  Concrete gives off a lot of heat as it sets and cures due to the chemical reactions in it. Your garage might actually get warmer during the process. I assume that you are looking at about a 4 inch layer.

Get some "Greased Lightning" at the dollar store and spray some on a rag. Wipe it on one part of the shoe first to make sure it's safe and doesn't wipe off the shoes polish. You will see how clean it gets. I've been using cleaning products for years, and depending on how you apply it, this is one of the best for taking that yellow smoke off of pretty things I buy at flea markets. And , yes, I have used it on shoe polish also, You just have to be careful since some shoe polish is better than others.
qHEpR92Gaa	1Vacuum your entire house with a hose attachment to suck up the spider webs. Make sure that you vacuum in corners and around light fixtures because these are popular areas for spider webs.   Step2Use a spider web remover. These removers are basically regular dusters with an extended handle to get to hard to reach areas where spiders make their webs.   Step3Clean away the spider web with the patented spray Cobweb Eliminator. This product not only removes the web, but also leaves behind a residue that prevents spiders from spinning webs in the future.   Step4Spray webs outdoors with a garden hose. This cleans the surrounding area and gets rid of the spider web. If you can't reach the web with the hose, use a stick to eliminate the web.     1Visit a grocery or hardware store and buy a special solution that deters spiders from building webs on household surfaces. Ask an employee to point you to products that are safe to use in homes.   Step2Move furniture away from corners. It's important to move all furniture, including heavy furniture, away from corners to allow you the proper space to work.   Step3Sweep and dust in corners to ensure that spiders are not given the opportunity to build webs in corner areas.   Step4Vacuum your home's corners. Handheld, small devices are especially useful in corners because they allow for easy manipulation of the device. They also have small bags that are easily disposable and replaceable.   Step5Spray the solution in your home's corners. Try to aim at areas where you commonly see spider webs. Pay special attention to any crevices that are near corners.   Step6Dispose of the vacuum's bag after you vacuumed. Thoroughly clean all reusable implements like dusters and brooms to ensure that spider webs and any possible eggs are completely cleaned. Common household cleaning agents (like those containing diluted bleach) can be used to sterilize and kill any remaining remnants of the spiders and their webs.   Step7Rearrange your furniture every time you clean. Switching the positions of furniture opens up the spaces to traffic and creates inhospitable conditions for spider web building. Convince the spiders that they are not welcome simply by being active and reminding them of your presence.   Step8Clean around problem corners regularly.|`|f4d90c6153afed6517f6a6304b30df86aa	You can dust them away and 90% of the time a spider wont return but build else where.

fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	You have a bit of a sediment problem. You may be able to drain and flush the water heater to get rid of most of the sediment. Just make sure you turn off the gas or electric supplying the heater before you start.|`|3W18HDxxaa	no but you need to flush it out,      at the bottom  is a spigot, [looks like a out door faucet]    hook a garden hose to it  run the hose out side turn the valve on  let it run for 3 or 5 min, shut it off remove hose .   this needs to be done once a yr,|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Folks, I've been at this water heater stuff a long, long time, and I can tell you unequivically that unless  you have an electric water heater and care to remove the bottom element so you can suck the majority of the lime, calcium buildup out of the tank, you'd be wasting your time to just drain it.   When water heaters are manufactured, the drain spigot they put in is designed to let out one thing and one thing only, water!.    It's not in the best interests of water heater manufacturers to put a drain in their product through which you could actually remove anything that might harm the insides of the tank, the units would last way too long that way.   Nothing bigger than a BB can get out of 99% of the original drain spigots on water heaters.   If you wait more than six months in an area where there is known to be a fairly high concentration of lime, or calcium in the water, it's already too late to drain to save.    If you do have an electric unit, can take the lower element out and suck most of the junk out with a wet/dry vac, then you can extend the life of the unit a few years probably.  If it's a gas unit, the spigot is actually a fair distance up from the bottom of the tank and won't let much of anything out at all.  Save your time and effort.   The sediment will continue if you don't either clean it or replace the unit.  If you do replace the unit, have the installer replace the drain spigot with a short 3/4" galv. nipple and a straight through ball valve.  It will have an opening the size of your thumb to allow large chunks of lime sediment to drain in the future.|`|mqUaiNeUaa	Most people replace the heater when it starts to leak.  You really don't have a good idea how long it will last and the sediment is not a reliable indicator.  I would say no -- wait until it leaks.|`|shRGskJVaa	what clothes so u dont wet them and look just buy a new 1|`|3sU90myfaa	Your hot water heater needs flushed out and drained..this is sediment in the water, calcium,minerals etcetera//they have a faucet like attachment on the bottom to flush the heater with..attach a garden hose to it..turn the breaker off if electric, the gas if gas..and turn the water valves off at top on the input..open the faucet like attachment(run the water hose outside through a window etctera with a downhill slope on the hose )..and allow it to drain all out...after it has drained then turn the water supply on again, but not the power source(electricity or gas) and let it run freely as the water flushes out the tank for about 20 minutes...close the hose valve the hose is connected to, undo the hose and let the tank fill up...then turn your source of power back on to once again heat it..it will then be flushed and clean|`|DFmWVb63aa	Flush the water heater and you should be okay. If the water heater temperature ever starts to fail on you replace the water heater. By the way you should try and flush the water heater once a month to prevent this sediment problem your having. Also if your hot water at any of the faucets quits turning the water all the way off flush the valves of the sediment. I only mention this because it sounds like you have alot of sediment coming through the hot side. Regards|`|OgTqspPYaa	Please note that if you have an OLD water heater and you drain it that you may possibly take out some of the sediment that is stopping your heater from leaking. So if you do decide to drain it realize it may then start to leak.

AA10097817	That could be a zoning consideration to add up. Our friends did it. The configuration looked kind of funny when it was done, because of the placement of the stairs and because the foundation was not built for a second story. If it's nice on the inside now, why not just give it a face-lift on the facade.    I'd talk to an architect to get their advice.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	its wonderful that you are in such a great area and of course you don't want to give up a beautiful lot.   if it were me i would another floor and change the exterior of the house.    it would be cheaper to do that especially if you can do some of the work yourself!
AA10753451	I would compromise with a light rose. The rose colors blend with wood, especially cherry very nice.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	i think if you love pink i would go with a soft pink with a lot of yellow in it. i would also try to go to a warm green because that is very vintage and it will go good with pink. if you don't like that pick your favorite thing in your room right now and pick the color around that. hope this helps!|`|PjzJ9QQRaa	Are you kidding?  Pink and brown go awesome together.  Especially a dark shade of pink.  I agree with the guys who said use rose, it would look awesome.  And would fit the vintage look very well.  Plus it would tie in your pink bed set, no matter if it was light or dark pink!    You may also want to consider painting only 2 walls the rose, and maybe doing a much paler shade of pink, or light brown.  Something that would still match the color, very vintage!  That may sound like a dumb idea when you read it, but if you google some interior decorator rooms, you will see that done often, and it turns out great!    Good luck, and whatever you do, I hope you love it!|`|rBoyJ9vCaa	If you look at the color wheel you can see what colors would complement pink. I think a yellow/blue or a yellow/green mixture would be go great together.

They are patterns that will still look great in your bedroom in a few years. Have you ever purchased a comforter from either company? My current comforter is from Delia's. I have had it for about 4-5 years. The color still looks great and the fabric is super soft. Whichever site you finally decide to buy your comforter from make sure you thoroughly read the whole description. Let me share with you what happened to me... Even though I love my comforter... well it's not really a comforter. It is a duvet cover. A duvet cover is just basically a cover for a comforter. So when you get it there will be no filling in it. It's just like 2 sheets sewn together. So keep in mind that either you will have to spend extra money on a comforter (if you can you may even get a feather one!) or put one of your old ones in it. After mine arrived from Delia's I didn't want to return it because I loved the print I got, so I just went ahead and spent a little extra money to get myself a feather comforter to put inside it and I love it. Oh and I also noticed that the ones from Urban Outfitters were shams. Shams aren't thick comforters, they are too thin for my taste. So to make a long story short. Pick whichever one u like the best and think will work for you.   Oh and don't forget to READ EVERY DETAIL ABOUT EACH ONE OF YOUR CHOICES.
r1D9P4Vyaa	Yes it can be done, it will/should  be ran tight up against the wall.

Also check with the country's immigration services to see what you need to work in that country.|`|AA12196547	You will have a difficult time finding work in the US in this field....the Mexicans already control our landscaping markt...Sorry!|`|6f3afd9beeaf30e109e33231297c9f94aa	Your best bet is to start of portfolio of your work thus far and find a way to advertise it. (i.e lots of genuine pictures). My initial though would be to go areas where people have lots of money and where the weather induces gardening and such. Therefore south California, states in the sun belts and southern states should be your points of focus in my view.
