20090223112530AAWBcYD	Health;Other - Health	Need some reassurance...?	I just went to the doc yesterday with horrible pain in my lower right abdomen all the way to my back.  The doctor reffered me to the ER and after blood work and a CT, they came back with 3 things: a "funny" looking appendix with something white in the middle, but not going to do anything about it, a right ovary full of cysts and other material, and a liver with a cyst like thing inside of it.  All of which they arent going to do anything about!     On one hand, I was relieved that maybe they didn't think it was serious enough to do anything about, on the other hand, what if it only gets worse!   We want to try and get pregnant this month, but not I'm afraid to even try in case my body gets worse and then causes complications during the pregnancy?!   I need a hug. :o(

20090223112527AAQ8qXF	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Can Herpes be spread to another person by a kiss on the cheek?	Hello. Recently my eldest brother was diagnosed with the herpes simplex virus type 1 or in other words, cold sore/oral herpes. Before this diagnosis he just believed it was a zit above his lip. I am worried because my children and I, as customary, always greet my brother with a kiss on the cheek and vice versa. Is it possible when he gave us  a kiss on the cheek believing it was a pimple, that he passed it to us? I strongly feel my eldest brother got this from our younger brother, who unknowingly to him, used his shaver. Even though I haven't noticed anything like that on his face, he is constantly in and out of jail and is a drug addict, so I wouldn't be surprised what diseases he might have. My brother doesn't let him in his home, unfortunately out mother lives with him and lets in our lilttle brother when my older brother is at work. Anyways, any info will be greatlly appreciated. THANKS :)
20090223112545AA4HFsd	Health;Dental	Dental Assisting? Is it a good job or should I find something else?	I'm getting very frustrated with my job. I'm only getting payed minimum wage and have no health insurance. I'm beginning to go crazy living with my parents and really want to be able to move out in the next year or two. I REALLY need a new job!   I'm 22 and was thinking about getting into the medical or dental field but don't think I'm financially able to go to a 6 year college (or even a 2 or 4 year college). I was thinking about becoming a dental assistant since it doesn't involve as much schooling. Only problem is I'm a male and most dental assistants are female. Also, I hear they don't get payed very well. What do I need to do to become a dental assistant, what is the starting pay and are there many male dental assistants?

20090223113314AAYkcNo	Health;Mental Health	Who is he, why did I used to see him and why don't I see him anymore?	I used to have nightmares when I was younger and whenever I woke up afterwards, standing in front of me would be a person. I don't know who they were or why they were there but I would only see them when I had a nightmare. Sometimes the nightmares were random but most of the time they were the same until a couple of years later. I would be upstairs in a large room in a cot and it would be dark. And every time a man would come in and hit me. I usually would just let him but after a while I could crouch and turn over, cover my head and then wait and after a while he would start leaving. I knew when he was coming because I would hear footsteps and my heart would beat faster. But then, later on I started having the dream in different parts, like about 5 years ago, when I was in Year 5, I would have the dream round the back of the library, and I would hide behind my teacher and crouch and cover my head and he would go. Now, here's the weird part, if he hit me I would wake up, hear the same footsteps and I would pull the quilt over my head and then when I looked again I would see this person and I would hide again. But if I hid from him in my dream and he left, I could wake up and no-one would be there. Also about 4 years ago they stopped the about 2 years ago I had 1 more and now I haven't had that dream since. So what I want to know is, who is this person, why would I see him after I woke up and why he suddenly stopped appearing in my dreams and in real life.

Trying this whole 'being healthy' thing for, pretty much, the first time in my life.. Whilst I've exercised in the past, I've never really eaten healthily, so.. I'm looking for some answers about whether my diet is suitable for:      - Weight loss - I'd like to lose a good few pounds, or at the very least, burn off the excess fat around my waist..!      - Getting 'healthy' - I want to make sure I'm putting 'the good stuff' in, to keep my body working well and stop me from feeling so damn tired all the time.      I'm almost 23 years of age, weigh 14st 8lbs and I'm 6'2" in height. My average weight used to be between 13 and 14st.. I'm comfortable with this, when it's a lean weight, unlike now.. Haha.      On average, I'll eat:      Breakfast - 3 slices of wholemeal toast, thinly spread with margarine, 2 slices with marmite and 1 with a thin layer of peanut butter (i was told quality peanut butter was actually good for you!). To drink, orange juice.      Dinner - Fruit salad (apple / orange / grapes / pineapple..), natural yogurt with plain granola      Tea - Something with wholemeal pasta. E.g. Today it's been tuna and wholemeal pasta with lots of onion and whatever frozen veg i could find (peas, carrots, sweetcorn, greenbeans). Tomorrow it'll probably be chicken with tomato veg pasta.. Or fishcakes with potato + veg.      Snacks in the day - Usually a few handfuls of peanuts + raisins from a pack, or a banana / whatever fruit is around at the time.      Exercise - 4/5 times a week I go to the gym to do about 45 mins of cardio exercise, and a little weight training.      So.. There we have it. Hope this question isn't too damn long.. Haha. Am I eating too little? Not the right stuff?  I'm just guessing at the moment.. Trying to get my 5 a day, eat wholemeal, etc..      Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer!      Shoe

20090223120037AAZ3S85	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Cold Sore Sufferers, any suggestions please?	I get cold sores all the time and they are always really bad, everyone in my family can get them however I am the only person who gets them a lot, at a guess I would say 10-20 times a year where everyone else in my family might get two at most a year.  If you do the math that pretty much means I have blister on my lip half the year.  It’s very embarrassing not to mention it kills having a social life.   I looked at what triggers there are and none of those apply.  I am not sick, stressed, been in UV rays etc, and I keep a healthy diet etc.  With as often as I get them I don’t think it has anything to do with my cycle and just as a side note I wash my hands all the time too and I have had no physical contact with anyone for a very long time, or better yet I have had at least 6 cold sores since I had any contact with anyone.   Most of the time, I wake up with the already formed cold sore and the blisters are usually already popped when I wake up all this happens with no warning. (If there is a “tingle” stage I am asleep when it happens.)  And the few times I do know that a cold sore is about to arise nothing I seem to do helps it at all.  I have tried Abrevia, campho phenique, ice cubes, tooth paste, pills and any other common remedy with no avail.   Do you know if there are any food triggers that might assist a cold sore in forming?  Maybe there is somehting I can avoid.        I would like to get a social life and needless to say most guys don't hit on girls with a big sore on thier lip.

20090223115916AAe4lyL	Health;Women's Health	Cramps + Test Results?	I had really constant cramps for a couple months, followed by a day of cramps so intense I couldn't sit up straight, could hardly walk, and was basically crying. This wasn't just before my period, it was like a couple months STRAIGHT. After that one day of really bad pain,. it went back to the original cramping for a few days, then I had another day or really bad pain and now it's just cramping again. This is all on the same spot, my left side.   I went to the doctor, and she did a bunch of test and sent me for an ultrasound. She did the pelvic exam and when she pushed down on the spot it felt really tender and a little painful and she even said she felt something. it all came back fine, my bladder, ovaries, uterus, bowels are all fine, no infections, no std, nothing else abnormal, no cysts, NOTHING. I'm on the pill so I shouldn't be ovulating anyways.       What else could this possibly be? Everything I can think of would have no reason to last for months, and the doctor just said to come back if it gets worse since she didn't come up with anything. But this is clearly abnormal. Any ideas?

20090223064743AAbCeI4	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why do people who are naturally VERY thin stuff themselves?	Almost every person that I know that is naturally very thin also eats very unhealthy. My sister, for example, had a BMI of 15.3. She would eat junk food, candy, and just HUGE amounts of food. When she got into her 20's she became chunky.      Don't people get that eventually your metabolism is going to slow down and then you gain weight? So it's better to start eating well early....      Every person that is naturally thin that i know, including some ex-models, became chunky later.       Whereas I myself stay slim through exercise and diet and haven't become chunky even though my metabolism isn't as fast as it used to be.

20090223120925AAc4IuN	Health;Other - Health	Will my stomach explode if I get real fat?	I know heart attacks and cardiac arrests are the more common consequences of being fat. But sometimes I have this fear that if I eat anything or bend over or sit down, my stomach will explode and my insides will spill out. This might sound wierd but yeah sometimes I think that. Like there have been lots of films like Alien and Blade when the human kept expanding until he exploded or something came out of him or her. I know it's all fake but it's still scary to think about. Sometimes I worry my belly will literally burst open especially since I had it stapled as a baby for surgical reasons. Maybe I should just drink water and exercise from now on so all my organs stay inside me.

I should have started my new pack a day sooner, not later. I'm now due for my period on March 6th which is the 3rd placebo day.      What can I do to not have my period on March 7? I'm seeing my bf that day, for the first time in six weeks, and then going home on the 8th. I can either start my period sooner or push it off until later, but I DO NOT WANT IT ON MARCH 7. I'll even compromise and be on my til end for the 7th if that makes it easier.      Also, I prefer not to stack my packs, as I did that once before and my next period was AWFUL.

20090223102616AAuM7Cy	Health;Women's Health	Girls was my sister right to defend herself in this situation?	My little sister Amy whose 16 was at school Friday and a 14 year old guy grabbed her bum under her skirt. Well she turned round and hauled off and kicked him hard in the testicles she had heavy shoes on as she is a goth.       Anyway the guy fell down and cried. Amy then shouted at him calling him a little perv and told him that she hoped his balls popped. The teacher see this and pulled her into the office by which time the lad was puking on the floor.       My parents went to the school today (Monday). The principle decided that the one week suspension for Amy is appropriate, however the boy is also going to have a one week suspension put on his record although he is unlikely to be able to return to school during the weeks suspension due to the extent of his injuries.       The boy had surgery friday and the doctors repaired his left testicle that had been ruptured, although due to the damage sustained the testicle will not be able to produce any sperm. The boys right testicle had to be removed due to it having multiple ruptures.       The boys mother and my parents have agreed that this should be the end of the matter. Amy is not happy at being suspended as she feels that it was self defense and their were people who saw the incident that backed her story up.      I do agree with Amy in the respect that the boys injuries are as a direct result of his actions and that she should nt be held responsable for injuries he suffered.      1. Do you think she did the right thing?   2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?   3. What would you have done?   4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?   5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?   6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?   7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?

When i was about 10 years old i was having an operation and when the anethatist was putting the tube down he knocked out one of my teeth. It was an adult tooth at the top just next to my front teeth. As i have got older my teeth have spreaded out so i have a gap in between my two front teeth and one at the side of them. I asked about getting a brace and they measured me up for one but then the orthadontist said that it would bring together my front teeth but then the gap at the side would be bigger. This put me off it so i decided to stay as i am. But after looking on the internet i have read about dental implants and was wondering if i had a brace fitted first, to bring my front teeth closer together and then have a dental implant in the gap at the side, would this work and how much around would it cost?   Thanks

I heard multiple pops when i landed awkwardly playing basketball.  I could not walk for a month or so and i don't have insurance so i did not get an MRI or go to a doctor.  This is the 2nd time ive done this, the first time wasn't that bad, i may just have torn the MCL or LCL and it healed in like 6 months but the 2nd time was worse.  Its been almost 7 months and i can still feel it.  I can't bend my knee all the way without feeling pain.  What do you think is going on with it?  I know i tore something and i hope it isn't the ACL or PCL, I just don't know. I know MRI's are expensive and i don't have insurance so what should i do? I've been rehabbing myself and working it out at the gym. and ive been running as well, i hope its not making it any worse. what else can i do by myself to make it better or what are alternatives to find out what actually happened to it.

I usually dress conservatively, because I am much older and never would blur that line anyway, but also don't want to pass out from sweating to death.      Today, I was doing these dips that were, actually (and surprisingly to me and my low self-esteem and lack of positive body image, though I have worked out a lot in the past couple of years) fairly flattering to my build and noticed some young women stopping and staring in (either out of curiosity or wondering what guy that age can do those kinds of dips -- I noticed them by looking at the mirror). Of course, this made me feel further self-conscious, as the shirt I was wearing was one where, once sweaty, became very form-fitting. I was the only person in the gym at the time.       Are there some more modest outfits I could buy that also wouldn't contribute to heat-stroke?

We decided to drive a different car so we walked to the front of the house. I was left at the back door to close it by myself. I had a lot of stuff in my hands so i got really mad. I slammed the GLASS door. My hand went through and it cut up my arm. I had to get 38 stitches from starting at my thumb. Skipping a little down to my wrist. Stopping and then a long scar down my arm (on the inside) Then there is a small one left.      I want to get it removed because I want to be a model and it would get in the way of my career. My mom says if it doesn't clear on its own, I can get it removed when I'm 15. 2 years have gone by and its not getting better. What could doctors do to clear it up. Would it hurt? And how would they do it , and for how much.

Trouble is - he's VERY not expressive. He's on this medication for anxiety disorders that flattens him out emotionally.

He says thing flatly in overly simple language (like if I called him crying about something he'd say, "that sucks,") and it really hurts me.    It makes me want to put myself in dangerous situations, maybe drink too much or walk alone at night, etc. just to try to get a reaction out of him. I know that this is not healthy. I want to learn to just deal with his flatness but I have a history of being abused by guys who are very flat right before they strike, so it makes it really hard to get used to.      What do you think? Can he change? Can I? Or should I call this thing off before it hurts either one of us more??

20090223123520AADcOVE	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	What can I do for my pain?	I have a pain in the right side of my upper flank, just under the ribs.   I think that it's my liver, but my doctors won't tell me. It's a very long story. Here's just a short version...      When I was 13, I started my period, and I started to hemorrhage severely.   I bled for 3 weeks, and was very sick. My parents finally figured something was very wrong with me. ( I never told my parents, but they figured it out anyway)  They rushed me to the E.R. and they admitted me for a week there. After, I was fine. Until a year later...   I was at my grandma's house, and when we were shopping I started to get short of breath. At first, I ignored it, until it got very painful.   after about 45 minutes, it was hurting so bad I couldn't take a deep breath. My grandma took me back to her house, and I laid down for a while. My grandma kept asking me if she should call an ambulance, but I told her no, so I suffered it out from 1:45 pm to 3:00am.    After that time, I finally told her I couldn't take it anymore, so we went to the E.R. At the E.R. they did a whole bunch of tests, and said I had a lymph node infection; to go home, I'll be fine.   Ok. Here' s the good stuff....   Ok, about 6 months later I had a similar pain, but this time it moved from my chest to my right upper abdomen.   I went to the E.R. again, and there they told me I had a gallbladder attack, I needed surgery if I wanted the pain to leave.   So I went and had the damn surgery done, and blop!   I was fine. or so I thought.   Again...   After 6 months the pain was back, but even worse than before.   At 6:00 am on a friday morning, I woke up and I couldn't breath, so my dad called an ambulance. This was not just comfortable, it was extreme pain!   Anyways, the EMS personnel told me my heart was skipping beats, so they took me to the local E.R. On the way there, they gave me 3 nitro's, which didn't even fade this pain.   This pain was just not I couldn't breath, it was a very sharp stabbing pain in my middle upper abdomen.   (like the "lymph node infection" pain, but much worse)      Anyways, when I got to the E.R. the doctor there told me I was just having a panic attack, to go home, I'd be fine.   So i left, and went to another E.R. ( because I know this pain is not normal)   And the doctor there told me the same thing.   I went home and tried to ignore the pain, but i couldn't.   So, at 6:30 am on saturday morning i went to yet another E.R.   And the doctor there asked me a couple questions, and then admitted me on the spot.   It turns out I had abnormal liver function tests, and really highly elevated bilirubin levels.   They kept me for 2 weeks, and then sent me home.   they never told me what was wrong, just that I had abnormal liver function tests, and high bilirubin levels.   Anyways, I had a follow up with my doctor, and she gave me neurontin to try to see if it would help me or not.    ( the reason is that I've tried everything that's legal to dull this pain.   I've tried morphine, I've tried lortabs, percocets, ETC. )   So I tried it and it works better than everything else I've tried.      I was just wondering if anyone could help me figure out what this pain is. My doctor mentioned Hepatitis, but she's never tested me. I've had multiple blood transfusions when I was 13. Could this make me get Hepatitis? I was also diagnosed with Von Willebrands Disease at 13, so when I go to the dentist, or anything that could make me bleed, even a little bit, I have to have factor. So I've been exposed to A LOT of blood and blood products. And I have a quiet heart murmur.   I don't have any other health problems but this.   I just can't figure out why Neurontin helps me, when nothing else does.    I have no problem in taking Neurontin for a long time, I just want to know what is causing the pain.      I'm taking Neurontin 300 mg once daily.      PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME!

I'm now 20 and within just a few months i gained about 20 lbs from eating a lot and partying. i stopped all of that about a year ago and have been to THREE personal trainers and on numerous different eating programs and can't lose a thing. i actually end up looking worse.      my waist is 6 inches bigger than it used to be and my legs used to be really nice and slim and now they are super chunky and have cellulite everywhere and it looks odd because i have a slim body frame and it just sits on top of it.      I eat around 1200 calories a day, write down everything i eat, drink tons of water, and run for an hour (about 4 miles) every morning, along with weight lifting 2-3 days a week. adding the muscle to my legs has made them look even worse. I can't fit into anything and i look unrecognizable to myself and anyone else. Every trainer i've been to has said i'm following the eating program just right, so why haven't i been able to lose anything in the past year? my body looks really abnormal because i look like i'm supposed to be skinny, but i have a lot of body fat just sitting in certain places. can someone maybe help me out or explain something to me? thanks

So I was wondering if this is a healthy lifestyle.  i don't believe in diets but just tell me if this is okay...      btw i'm 15, 5'7'' and weigh 123      okay...      breakfast:  bowl of Kashi Go Lean with a banana (actually i go a bit above serving)  so it's more like 2 bowls or 1.5 bowls      lunch:  turkey and cheese on wheat bread, fruit, granola bar, sometimes pretzels (hard ones that come in the UTZ bag)      snack:  fiber bar, yogurt, total cereal, some piece of fruit      dinner:  skipped.      i don't skip dinner because i have an eating disorder.  i skip because i have already eaten my daily amount of calories and if i go over that i'll get fat.      i'm a gymnast and i do that 6 hours a week and i play softball for 2 hours a week.  plus my auntie has a step climber that i go on and she lives right down the street from me.      so tell me...should i cut back?  or am i doing pretty good?  thank you so much for your help (:  i really do appreciate it.

I have had a constant congested nose for about 5 months now. There is not a day that goes by that I can breathe clear. I went to my physician and she thought it was an infection so she gave me medicine for that but it didn't work. I went to an ENT and he said he couldn't find anything wrong with my nose. I am seeing an allergist this week. I always thought allergies caused sneezing and mulitple symptoms. The only thing I have is that in  at least one of my nostrils( it switches between them) the hole to my sinuses swells shut. I can look up my nose and just see red inflamed skin( or whatever it is up there). Is anyone else suffering from this as well???

It started when I woke up in the morning with a very dry mouth and a little sore throat. So I started drinking more water often, eating fruit and exercising regularly. This is the third day and now it's starting to get worse. My throat is very sore now, even after drinking water (because it relieves the pain sometimes). It's even the worst time because this Saturday, I have a scholarship exam and right now I'm struggling. I've done my research and this is probably why I have it. The day before I had this... illness (I guess) I bumped my head onto the corner of my shed. I don't think I have diabetes mellitus.      What causes diabetes insipidus?    In some people, the brain lacks a hormone called ADH, which your body needs to for the kidneys to work effectively. Often, people with diabetes insipidus get it after an injury to the head, after brain surgery, when suffering a brain tumor; it may run in the family, or some medicine, such as lithium, can cause it, although approximately 25% of the time, doctors can't find any reason for it.    ~By 'What's The Problem'      So that might be the problem. If so, is there a way to stop it? I'm very desperate to get out of this.   Thanks for your help...

However, when the doctor cut the string on my second one she cut it too short. I am not able to check the placement but have still never had any complications with it. It was checked by a different docotor right after and she said everything looks right.

I have been juggled from 1 dr to another to another to another for the past 12 years for my spinal/back pains.  I have had physical therapy, massage therapy, steroidal therapy, lower back surgery, neck fusion, and a few other therapies.  I have seen neurosurgeons, neurologists, physical therapists, regular dr's, rheumatologists, and pain management specialists.  I do know after dealing with this for 12 years that I have had mri's, cat scans, milograms, emg's, over and over again b/c each dr requests they're own...however no one tells me anything other than what I already know.  Which is the spacing in my spinal column is 2 cm (or something like that...mm?  I forgot).  It's narrow, however.  Bulging discs, stenosis, and a bunch of other medical terms.  Each dr tells me what I already know as far as anatomical physical problems.....but I'm looking for an official diagnosis as far as what's causing it!!!  They all keep sending me home with pills, more scans to be done, and they never officially 'diagnose' me with anything!  I feel like I'm nothing but a co-pay to these doctors.  WHO can officially give me a freaking diagnosis to explain all my spinal/back/neck problems?????

We talked for over an hour and he prescribed me Clonazepam to take for the anxiety. He told me to make an appointment for February which is on Wednesday. In mId January I went to see the doctor that was on call at the clinic because the temples of my head were blue/greenish and I was getting horrible headaches. The blue/green was just my veins and he sent me for x-rays for my headaches which turned up fine and he sent me or blood tests which turned up fine also. The doctor said it was all from stress. But now, I am going back to see my doctor and I just feel so dumb because the other doctor didn't find anything wrong with me. I don't want them to think I am wasting their time, because I honestly feel so stressed out it's unbelievable. Anyways, so my anxiety is worst and I even think I'm depressed.

I tested positive for type 1 on june of 2008,      Ok now lets continue. I kept having sex with him tell november of 2008.I std tested again on jan 16th of 2009. At this time when i got my tests back i was type 2 positive. My number was 4.10 with the type 2. And my type 1 was 5.00.       Now with all of this being stated is it possible that when me & him started to have sex in march of 2008 he had herpes but then when i tested in june of 2008 that he hadnt infected me yet?Mabye that when i tested again jan of 2009 that the antibodies finally did build up enough that it showed up on the blood test. Its possible that he infected me some where inbetween june of 2008-nov of 2008! Cause in middle november thats the last time me & him had sex.       Now with all of this being stated i have to clarify something i had no idea tell jan 16th i had herpes. I have no idea if this is the dude that gave me the herpes or not. I am asuming so sense we have been having sex for a long time. Yes i know i was stupid i never wore condoms. So ya please call me stupid for doing that cause i even call myself stupid for doing that. I have no proof that he is the one that spread it to me cause he is denying it.       I have to add 1 more guys into the mix. I had sex with doug on jan 1st of 2009! If doug would of spread the herpes to me i would of had to have Seroconversion in 2 weeks time. Honestly im not sure if thats possible. I have heard that it takes from a month to 6 months to test positive for type 2 herpes on the blood test. So ya 2 weeks is a lil to shy for that. And plus i had type 1 herpes in june of 2008. I have no idea on how long ive had type 1.  I heard it can take a lil bit longer to Seroconversion when the person had type 1 before they had type 2. I cant recall why but i have heard this.       Now with this being stated I do recall having a bump down below on jan 4th for about a week. I got the bump on my period. After my period was done i put lip balm on it & it cleared right up.But keep in mind i hadnt yet did my 2nd std test so at this time i had no idea of what this was. I passed it along as a infected hair or whatever.So now its middle feburary. I got another bump the same as like on jan 4th. Actually this time i went to the dentist & i think that stress or whatever on my body & thats why i had this outbreak. So with this outbreak on jan 4th for a full week is it possible that it could of been doug that spread it to me? After sex only 3 days?Thats what im very confused about. I have heard that u can get an outbreak from 2 to 20 days after being infected.       Other then this honestly i think it was the first guy i was having sex with for a year. I dont think it was doug. I am having doug tested but he is under his parents insurance & he is scared they will find out. And well the other dude i had sex with for a year wont get tested & is denying it. So here is where i need your help. I need u to give me your opinion on the situation! Who do u think infected me?Guy number 1 or doug?I will just call him guy number 1 or the dude i slept with for a full year. I am really confused & just want to figure out whom i got this from so i dont have to keep accusing the other one of spreading it to me. Cause right now im blaming both of them!!!Thanks every one!!!!!
20090223142839AAlRroh	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Could this be melanoma?	We were watching a bunch of things on melanoma in class today, and I started to get really freaked out. I have this weird mole on the back of my neck that is not irregularly shaped at all, but it is 'elevated' slightly. When I run my finger across the back of my neck, I can feel that area slightly elevated. We were looking for 3 causes of melanoma, and it only matches one of the three. (It only matched elevated out of F, (I forget) and G for growing.) It certainly hasn't been growing, as I have had this mole since as far as I can recall (about 6 or 7) and actually since then it hasn't grown radically, and it has stayed in the same position, and no change in coloration, it just looks like a brown mole, and it's pretty small. I've been thinking that the doctors probably needed to have caught it from the numerous checkups I have had since I was a baby, so they probably should've found it by now, right? Any help on whether I should be a dermatologist would be thankful, thank you

For me it was mainly through finding the right combinations of medications for my previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder; after being started on a mood stabiliser as well as my maximum dose of antidepressant I just felt much more stable in myself and felt that I didn't need to do it anymore.      Fast forward 6 months and I'm on the same medications and for the most part they're still working very well, but today in particular I'm really struggling with wanting to harm myself. I don't want to give in, I've resisted it for 6 months now and I know that even one slip will be enough to send me spiralling back into my state of self harming multiple times every day.

20090223133522AAoEFuL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Should I sue? Can I sue?	Six years ago, age 29, I had high bp readings. I was prescribed clonidine. At the time I was taking remeron. Now I have discovered remeron is an alpha 2 blocker and clonidine is an alpha agonist and that remeron is known to cause hypertensive emergencies in those taking clonidine. For the last six years I have been a moderate drinker. No more that two drinks a day. I have told my doctors this and none thought it was an issue. Now I have learned that alcohol has the same effect in combination with clonidine as does remeron. For most of the past six years I have taken effexor which also raises blood pressure. None of my doctors thought this was a problem.       After discontinuing remeron, effexor, and stopping drinking my average sytolic bp has dropped by 25 points.       I consider the all of the doctors I have seen for blood pressure over the last six years INCOMPETENT.       My high bp was 100% IATROGENIC.

My boyfriend of 9months, is fully deaf and has an implant called an ESPrit 3G. Since day one i have been amazed by him, he was worried i wouldn't want to get with him cos of his disability and peoples tendencys to understand his speach [due to him not being able to hear since he was 5].      I took to it all right away, but others can't. He's very insecure about his ear implant, i try and not let him worry it too much, as much as i can help. I've done everything i've so thought i can do...      ? Learning BSL- British Sign Language   ? Met his friends that are also deaf. [He asked me to , other girls turned him down before, due to being embarrassed].   ? Bought a book on deaf to try and understand it fully.   ? Researched about his implant to understand how it works.    ? Accepted his offer of me going all the way to Bradford to his next hospital appointment.   ?Teach him to read and write and speak more clearly.      Anyhow, people in public stare at his head, point , say things. I get really upset about this cos i can see his face when he know's this is going on. I've often had a screaming match with the most rudest of those people, and then have cried for him, i dont know why.      Somedays he goes down and thinks i don't love him cos of his implant and disability. He get's emotional and breaks down after it all build up. I comfort him as best i can... and here where my question comes in...      His age is 16 but not in the state of mind of a average 16yr old as such, but sometimes he can go in this childish mode, which i dont mind at all, i can handle that im not a shallow perosn.   He starts agreeing with this rude and offencive remarks people rudly make at him and says things like 'im thick my ears are stupid they dont even work', to make him feel better i tell him he has 'magic' ears, cos he can turn them on and off, feel vibration better, sign, lipread and a ton of other things he can do. This cheers him up alot with a big smile on his face, but tonight after i said it to him i thought to myself...      Is this wrong for me to say?   No nasty comments please and im 15 and hearing btw.

20090223135526AALWXuN	Health;Mental Health	Should I get tested for ADHD?	Okay, I have a lot of trouble staying focused on anything. While a teacher is lecturing I could entertain myself with something so stupid and simple as a paperclip, but then I cannot stop messing with it or whatever else is holding my attention. While doing whatever it is I am doing (like messing with a paperclip) I am not really focused on anything really but staring at the object in kind of a daze while I hear everything that is being said while not being able to process it.      Then there is another little issue. I forget stuff, a LOT. My dad can tell me to do something and it can be the most important thing in the world at the moment but I forget it before I can actually do what he asks. Later though, he reminds me again (and at this point he is pissed off) and it is like "oh duh" for me because I instantly remember everything linked to the topic at hand.      Really I just find myself distracted all the time by such insignificant little nothings. So should I ask my dad to schedule a visit with a doctor to see if I have ADHD? I would hate to pass by the chance that my lack of focus (which he sees as laziness) could be fixed by a simple visit with a doctor.   Tell me what you think or if there are other symptoms I should check for first.   Thanks
20090223142657AApwhOq	Health;Men's Health	Mom caught me Masturbating?	Dear Y!A, the worst thing has happened just yesterday.      I was sitting there in front of my PC, pants down, fapping to one of the hottest hentai pic I could've ever found on my hard disk, when my mother walked in.      Normally, I would've just tried to hide my erection by pulling my pants back up and pretending to do something else, preferably the least suspicious possible, but not then.      As I was nearing the end of my masturbatory session and couldn't hold it back anymore, I closed my eyes and let myself overwhelm to the orgasm just at the same moment she opened that damned door. I knew I should've locked it, but I believed nobody would've ever bothered entering without asking beforehand.      Thus, being unable to see anything for all the time I enjoyed the, let's say, "warm feeling", I couldn't have noticed she was here since the beginning.      So, yeah, my mother saw me ejaculating till the last drop of semen, and in the lewdest way possible, even.      It was only when I was finally done and did a swift peek to see if I had done any mess on the floor, that I realized her presence.      My heart went right down my stomach at her sight: she was just standing there, staring at me with dismay, then left the room without saying anything. I'm not lying if I admit that, then as now, I just wanted to die due to the huge embarrassment that followed.      About a day has passed since the incident, and she hasn't spoke a word to me yet. She hasn't made it evident, but I strongly sense that the good old days have abruptly come to an end for me.       What should I do about this?
20090223132902AAqkg82	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Partially torn ligament in my shoulders. URGENT.?	Hello guys, I recently went to visit my doctor to examine my shoulders. He told me that I have torn a ligaments on both of my shoulders, he moved my shoulders up and down and they were clicking a lot.       He then suggested me for some inflaming/pain killer pills; not quite sure what they are because they do not seem to have any effect on me yet as the pain continues to exceed.      He then told me that I should regularly move it a bit more?      BUT, I have done what he has said, but the pain continue's to develop and hurt, I have seen no change in the past week.      What can I do to reduce this? and how long will it take to heal itself?      Thank you.

Now that i have you attention, heres my REAL problem..lol         okay so like a year ago i started to have a big crush on this guy. he was sorta my friend. more like an accuantence and it seemed like he liked me., lets call him "elroy".it was all fun first untill he start going out with this other girl in my school, lets call her "amber", who he really really liked, like he was creepily obsessed with her. this broke my heart, and made me very jelous and really really hate "amber". they only went out for like two weeks when she broke up with him on spring break while completely intoxicated at some party. he was really heart broken by this and by what ive heard, he cryed to her. yeah..and while all this was happening my feelings for him kept growing..stupidly i decided to tell some friends, which i shouldnt have. long story short word got out and people kept bothering him about it like sending him emails pretending to be me and asking him if he liked me..that i heard when ppl asked him he would say he didnt want to talk about it. this made me feel like a complete dumb ***. time went on and summer went by, still my intense feelings for "elroy" didnt pass. then rescently right before christmas break things seemed to really hit off with us so to speak...we were talking and having fun again and started hanging out sorta,, i became close friends with his best friend. and i could've sworn he said to me in kind of a shy quite voice"i got you somthing, b..but i left it at home" and i was kinda scared so i ended up giving him what might seem to be a dirty look. after christmas break i was haging out with his best friend lets call him "bert" and he mentioned casualy "elroy's" new girfriend. i felt like crap. i dont knw what to do..i know this might sound stupid, but i think i might be in love with him. i cant imagine myself with anyone else. and im afraid i wont have a bf for long time again cuz i keep denying other boys because im living in this fantasy about "elroy"....i just want to move on...it hurts so bad, please give me some advise....what should i do??      there is way more details but its way too much to write....   i already wrote like an assay..lol   but this should explain it enough..

20090223142240AAM3Qvo	Health;Men's Health	Is there anything my husband can have done to stop semen?	I already know about a vasectomy to keep the woman from getting pregnant- but what about to stop semen when the man orgasms? I hate it and I never enjoy myself- we end up using condoms but then I get upset that he has to use that in order to please me- so in the end I'm never fully please. (never orgasmed myself either) I really think the only other option is something done for him to stop semen flow but to allow him to still orgasm. (and please don't try helping me on my orgasms....I've done everythign out there possible and there's nothing, even cheacked with the doctor and everything is normal. Even beign pregnant, my sexual level went down instead up and nothing ever works- the question at hand is about stopping or getting rid of semen flow, thank you)   I will chose a best answer but know that I can't post thumbs up or down, not enough points.

20090223134155AA6zkBs	Health;Mental Health	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

Right now, at 5'2" I am 174, I have done nothing but gain weight before giving birth and especially after. I have always had cellulite and it didn't bother me since almost every woman has at least a little bit. But right now mine is bad. I have it all over the back of my thighs and my booty and its starting to show up on my arms and the front of my thighs. I also have awful stretch marks on my boobs and legs and hips that were never there before. The weather is going to be getting nicer outside so I'm thinking I'll start walking my son to his little play group three days a week. If I walk there and back home it will be a little over 2.2 miles. I could even add a little distance since there is a track on the way. I would LOVE any help since I'm a new mommy and just mainly want to know if 2 miles 3 times a week (to start out with) not to mention the weight of the HUGE stroller I don't know why I bought will help me to lose a little weight. Also will the weight a lose make those nasty stretch marks go away? I know it will minimize the cellulite, but im more concerned about the stretch marks. Also, if you have any advice on creams or even workouts that have worked for you PLEASE let me know. I would be so appreciative of any advice I'm offered. Its always better to get advice from real people rather than websites. Thank you so much and thanks for reading my novel of a question.

20090223135838AAFS7lW	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I dont know if my ear piercing is infected, is it?	Hm. So I'ved gotten my second pair of ear piercings about 2 months ago. A few days after my peircing, my ear started to get swollen. The left one was more swollen than the one on my right. I took out the earring and saw that the spoke or whatever its called was HUGE. So my mom changed my earring. And in a couple of days it got better. Every now and then, it would itch. I dont really do much about it. When I take off the piece in the back of the earring, I see dried blood, sometimes wet. It's been going till now. When I take off the whole earring, I see that the spot where the earring is, is swollen. You can't see that it's swollen but you can feel it. When I touch it, it's kind of hard. & when I try to put my earring back in, it get's pass the hole in the front but when it gets in by a little, it gets stuck--kindof.    ALSO.   When I push my piercing hole thingie, :D , blood comes out, so I'm wondering if it's blood thats clogged in there?         Oh, and the few days after I got my piercing, when I took it out, it bled alot.

Last week it suddenly started hurting again.  Not as bad as the socket + infection but it's pulsing pain nonetheless.  The focus of the pain feels like the closest molar and a portion of the extraction area is sore.  I went to the dentist today and saw the hygenist who simply said it had food in it.  I wash it out regularly and had started to swish it out about two weeks ago.  Is it another dry socket?

It comes and goes and is not uncomfortable it just makes me worried because I could sit a place on my flat stomach and watch it move up and down. *It pulsates.*      Now, for the past week I have been having major pains which lead me to believe I have an ulcer. The burning doesn't go away unless I eat and I can't sleep, and I'm always nauseous.        I'm only 23 years old and 112 lbs...I don't understand.

20090223103746AAepWiR	Health;Men's Health	Testicle Pain/soreness/ tenderness?	My right testicle has been having a small pain for the last 2 weeks.  It is not always there, but it usually feels like a throbbing pain for a few seconds, then goes away, then comes back.  It is not unbearable, but it is uncomfortable.  It is similar to the feeling of getting hit in the testicles, but not as intense of a pain.  If getting hit in the balls was a pain of 10, then this feels like a pain of about a 3 or 4.  It is similar to this because its not my actual testicle that hurts, it is more of inside my body.  The pain is from the top of my testicle to about the bottom of the belt line.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

20090223114854AAXyLK1	Health;Mental Health	Is there any solution to my anxiety issues?	Ok here it goes, about 7 months ago I was under extreme stress,fear & I was in very very bad situation that no one would envy me on it, more over, things started to go from bad to worse & even worse to the point I thought few times in suicide, right at this point I started taking Valium tabs. -5mg- almost daily and some times twice daily, then after a while -3 months later- I decided to face the reality & quit that tabs & in fact things started by then to get a little bit better, the problem is that I started to develop symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder after quitting the valium as well as I assumed that I am an HIV+ -which is I am not-, I did two HIV tests & they were negative, I was happy a little bit bit but then again I started to worry about being HIV+ & also assuming that every one around me is HIV+, I know it does not make any sense to be worried about as I never did things like drugs or tattoos or even any kind of sexual intercourse, but I can't stop thinking about it, please please I need help, it's urgent and I am living in Iraq where you can't find a good psychologist if there is any. I am afraid that I'll think again in suicide or hurt my self.
