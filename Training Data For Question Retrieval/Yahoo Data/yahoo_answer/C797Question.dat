I'm a big fitness person and have had no bad effects eating cereal for breakfast every morning so I continued to do it for awhile. However...I do know oatmeal is a much, much better choice. Can anybody help me decide which Oatmeal is the absolute best choice. I want one that is totally natural with no preservatives and added ingredients.      Thank you!

I have read that even a small banana has 100 calories in, and a large one can have up to 172 calories. I can make myself an entire dinner with about 350 calories!      So now I'm scared to even eat a banana because of the amount of calories in it. Today I had a banana as a snack, and every two days I make a smoothie with one banana in, so I eat a banana once every two days. So as confusing as this sounds.. how can they be healthy with that many calories??         thanks  :)

I want it to be spicy or hot what kind of pepper or spice should I add to do this and  it will still go well with the other ingredients. Thank you.         Ingredients   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, each 4 ounces   2 tablespoons olive oil   4 shallots, thinly sliced   1/4 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced   1 tablespoon all-purpose (plain) flour   1/4 cup white wine   1/2 cup low-sodium chicken stock   1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary)   2 tablespoons chopped parsley               Directions   Place the chicken breasts between wax paper and pound with a mallet to flatten. Cut each piece in half lengthwise. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.      In a small frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and saute for about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring occasionally.      In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and wine until all the lumps are gone. Add the flour mixture to the shallots and mushrooms. Stir in the chicken stock and cook over medium-high heat. Stir until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add the rosemary.      In a large, nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and saute until no longer pink or until a thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 170 F, about 5 minutes.      To serve, transfer 2 chicken breast halves onto each plate. Spoon mushroom sauce over the chicken and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.

20080501151711AAZdH7B	Food & Drink;Ethnic Cuisine	Where can I find a tortilla/crepe iron?	I used to have one awhile back that was made by Betty Crocker. My grandpa had one years before that made by someone else. However I lost mine and I'm looking for a replacement. I did several online searches and even visited local stores like Bed Bath and Beyond and kitchen speciality shops with no luck. I have no problems whatsoever finding tortilla presses or crepe pans but I am not wanting anything like that. The pans don't make the crepes or tortillas thin enough. They're thick like pancakes.       To describe what it looks like, it's similar in shape to a pan: round on one end with a plastic handle. The iron (the round end) has a white base and the iron part is black, and the handle is the same white plastic as the base. It has a cord attached. It's not quite 2" tall to accomodate for the heating element inside the iron end.

I was wondering how many alcoholic drinks does it take you personally to black out (i.e. how good are you at drinking).  I usually black out after about 14 to 17 drinks, but occasionally I will remember everything for 20+ drinks.  I know everyone has a different tolerance for booze, I was just curious how the booze tolerance correlates to your susceptibility to blacking out.  I can usually drink about 25 drinks in a night, but most of the time I don't remember the last 10 or so drinks.
