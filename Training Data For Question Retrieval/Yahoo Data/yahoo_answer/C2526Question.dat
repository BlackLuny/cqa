20090202100944AA2iOrW	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What can I do about mechanic not fixing what he said he did?	I took my 2002 Mercury Mountaineer to a local mechanic (South Carolina) because of some clicking and popping heard at the wheel. He said it's the left front wheel bearing. He charged $356. Then we received a call and he said it also needs a carrier bearing and charged us another $200. We pick the car up on a Thursday evening. On the drive home, it was still making the clicking and popping noise, but by this time, the shop had closed. The next morning, we take it back to the shop. He looks at it again and says it's something else.       I'm fed up by this point and call him back and tell him don't touch it and that we will have someone else look at it. So we pick it up and drive straight home. The next morning, the brakes go out. I didn't hit anything, and nothing happened other than scaring me to death!!       So we take it to a different mechanic and he looks at it and says it needs a new left wheel bearing. Which is exactly what we paid the original $350 for.       How should I go about handling this? Am I just out this money?
20090202101456AAZlSsK	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I have just had an accident. ?	I was parked outside a farm off the main road, my daughter had got out of my car and left the passenger door slightly open whilst she got her wellies from the boot to change in to. Someone else came down the drive way and started to turn to park next to us, she skidded and hit my passenger door. Who is to blame? Someone said that I may be for leaving the door open. The driver of the other car got out and said that she was sorry and that she had lost control. I would appreciate any advice.  Thank you.

20061118055827AA2Cogw	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Opel Corsa Tom Tom, immatricolata gen 2006 - vendo. Qualche consiglio?	Ciao,      Per questioni economiche deve vendere la mia cara Opel Corsa Tom tom - immatricolata gennaio 2006, 5 porte. E' grigio metallizzato ed in ottimo stato. Avrà circa 20.000 km. L'ho pagata € 12.900 e vorrei farci non meno di € 10.000,00=. Considerate che ho un finanziament a tre anni (il primo scade a gennaio), e ne restano altri due. Secondo voi è meglio estinguere totalmente il finanziamento (resteranno ca. 5000 € da pagare) con il ricavato della vendita o passare il veicolo all'acquirente con le rate da pagare?      In quest'ultimo caso, chiederei € 6000,00. Ma si potrà fare? voi che ne pensate? Ho scritto alla ditta che m'ha fatto il finanziamento e sto aspettando che mi facciano sapere quale sia la migliore procedura). Se c'è qualcuno interessato (a Roma), mi faccia sapere, in privato. Grazie e ciao,
