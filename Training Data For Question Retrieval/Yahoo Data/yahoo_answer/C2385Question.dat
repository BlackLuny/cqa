20090128212529AABCXEx	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Urgent!! Ib program and music!!?	Hi ! I am a grade 10 student attending a secondary school in Vancouver and I am in a dilemma of whether I should take the Ib program! I am a classical guitar player who practices about 4hours a day and wishes to study in a music school after graduating! However, I am also interested in this Ib program because I quite honestly don't find regular school courses challenging and  like the philosophy of the program. I don't want to close doors on myself. People are giving me a lot of comments about how much I will be fed up with work if I join and not have any time to practice guitar. So I wanted to ask people who might have already finished the Program or is currently in it.    1. WIll I still be able to practice at least 3 hours of music everyday if I join Ib?    2. Would IB be a total waste of time if I want to do music for my life?    Thank You

20090128214217AA3HhPs	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone please edit my essay?	It is important that all individuals and especially those individuals that are the most vulnerable, oppressed, and "at-risk" members in our community are treated with the utmost dignity and respect. I know that for myself this is a motto that I live by: treat others how I would like to be treated, with dignity and respect. Therefore, every individual is important and deserves to be respected. I can readily understand that others would hope to be treated the same way under the law and in their daily lives. It is logical that we hope that others would  recognize that we want the same things for ourselves. I want to be able to do all that I can to make these people whole, empowering them so that one day many could even become stronger, happier, and more productive individuals within their communities.      Every individual has the potential inside of them to do or be what they want to be, but if no one sees it, they are less likely to to harness that potential and use it. First of all, we need to have the right tools to support these individuals in their personal growth and development. Secondly, we need to be able to describe viable choices for them, given their current skill level and help them to attain improved skill level. Thirdly, we need to guide them towards the recognition that the greater the knowledge, the broader the spectrum of choices they have. Finally, we also need to lead them to the understanding that freedom of choice ultimately translates to living life to the fullest potential. We need to ensure that their individuals needs are met so people can be more self-sufficient and able to make the best possible choices for themselves.

Im feeling very overwhelmed with school right now and I feel like I have almost no time for myself. I am trying to work on time management right now but it seems so hopeless. Even though I just started school 3 days ago I am already stressing out and already feel like this semester is going to be absolute hell.      I find myself dedicating so much time towards one particular class and then realize that I still have 2 other classes that I must get an A in. It's the pressure I put on myself to succeed and to do well in these classes that might be causing this, but I know what I need to do in order to do what I want to do, and now I am trying to execute. What are some good ways to alleviate the stress I am feeling and to help me not feel so overwhelmed with the workload I am taking on? (Besides going to the gym and working out)

Topic:  Schools in Alberta (where I live) should be organized according to student intelligence levels. These levels would be determined by a common exam provided by the Department of Education, Higher achieving students - 80% or better, would be assigned to designated schools. Average achieving students 60-79% would be assigned to designated schools. Students below 60% would be assigned to designated schools, At the end of the school year, a common provincial exam would be given and those grades would determine the placement for the following year.      Ok so this debate in English is i huge mark for the whole year, so I'm really trying to get a good mark on it.   I'm looking for solid points, if it seems obvious I probably already have it, but if you think it's a good solid original point, either affirmative or negative to the topic, it would be really helpful if you could put em up.

Yes, I know you're thinking that I should be doing this by myself. The thing is, making the city was the project, and we had to write a short story on it. The teacher told us that we could use online translators, but they're horrible. So if you would please:         Once upon a time, there was a tiny town called Toodles Town. Everything was perfect. There was a clothing shop, a grocery store, a pond, a skate park, a Hawaiian restaurant and a Bingo Casino. The town had one queen, a dog named Gem. Although she was very gifted as a leader, she was cruel hearted and blood thirsty. She also feasted on small animals. One day, she was too lazy to hunt. She asked the farmer, who was living next door, a favor. If the farmer told every citizen in the town that the she was sick, Gem would give the farmer a raise.   ‘If I do this,’ she thought, ‘All the small animals will come in my house to visit and wish me well. But when they step into my house, I’ll eat them whole. It’s as easy as food delivery!’ From her house, Gem could hear the farmer shouting the news, ‘Our queen is sick! Our queen Gem is sick!’ all the way from the skate park to the Hawaiian restaurant. In less than ten minutes, already four small animals went to visit Gem. But they weren’t visiting Gem… They were visiting her stomach! But one little animal did not visit Gem. The Ostrich. The ostrich wondered where all her friends went. She went to Gem’s house to check if they were okay, because the ostrich knew Gem was cruel. When she went in front of the door, she heard a voice.   “Ostrich, won’t you come in and visit me?” Gem called from her house. The ostrich cautiously looked down at the carpet. She saw a hundred footprints going in, but none going out. All of a sudden, the ostrich knew what was going on. She ran away and told all the elders.    A week later, a compromise was made and Gem and the farmer was exiled. Toodles Town never, ever had a problem again.

I have a keen interest in learning about new technologies and would love to be a part of something to do with technology. The only problem is that I don’t know what college major to pick. I’ve thought about computer science and have even gone to my friend’s computer science courses and find them REALLY boring. I don’t know about engineering either, it’s just too complicated and math oriented. I just know that I want a unique career in technology which will give me the opportunity to make some good money. I don’t want to go into software engineering, interactive media and graphic design though. Whenever I hear about new technologies such as cyborg, I get really excited. I love to build things. Someday I want to create something really great. I highly doubt engineering is for me since I never really got good grades in math all throughout high school. I also didn’t take chemistry or physics or anything in high school. Chemistry, physics and math doesn’t really interest me much, but I still want to do something that has to do with technology. Please suggest something to me. Thanks so much.

Please review the information on this link below where it starts out saying "Albany Distributing is committed..."       http://www.albanydistributing.com/inform...       I need help editing this page.  This is for my Company's website. I checked for spelling and grammar, all seems to be good.  But there a few things I'm not sure of.      1.) Do you see where the bullet points are at the top? If you notice, each bulleted item starts with a lower case letter.  I wrote it that way because the government will write the same way.  However, I am not sure if I should be using capitals.  Which is more appropriate?       2.) If you go down a little bit, you will see where it says "The minimum purchase amount for a PO is $500 USD.".  In the next sentence, I say $500 again, but I don't include the "USD" because I have stated it.  Is that appropriate or should I include USD?      3.) In the part that says "To place an order, please call our government sales specialist at 1-800-296-0820 ext. 837" Should "government sales specialist" be written as Government Sales Specialist or is it correct the way I have it?      4.) My last question is regarding the first paragraph that states: "Albany Distributing is committed to providing quality products at the best prices for our education, federal, state, and local agencies.  We accept purchase orders, credit cards, and bank wire transfer."      Where it says "Credit cards", I want to somehow incorporate Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover in there so they know we accept all major credit cards.  How can I reword this to sound good?

20090128225429AAfZUPA	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Should i lower my standards?	to be able to answer my question you will need to know a bit of background, but any advice based on the information i give you about myself is appreciated.  please, please take the time to read this and help me, i'm so very lonely. and if this is how your raising your kids let it be a warning to you.      first of all, i'm almost 22, and i'm still a virgin.  there are a few factors for why: i was home schooled up through high school, which at one time had caused incestuous curiosity (i found a way to spy on my sister in the shower, cause i hadn't yet discovered how to get around the parental controls on our computer) this is something i've pretty much completely dealt with since.  the real reason that home schooling hurt me, obviously, is that i literally didn't have any social interaction in any form with a girl that i was attracted to until age 18 (my parents had me really involved in sports and other groups, but again, no girls).  plus the social isolation creates allot of paranoia and delusions about how relationships are formed, or what people do when i'm not around, for example;          another reason aside form home schooling, is that my parents (mostly my mom) are religious fanatics, with views similar to southern babtist's (wish i know how to underline that southern babtist part).  my mom let me know on various different occasions that masturbating, and sex before marriage of any type, was a sin(and she is very smart, therefore having very good sounding reasoning behind her arguments).  i was even taught that kissing was something i should avoid because it might lead to other worse things.  my god, it sounds so sadistic now that i'm actually reading it typed out, but there was almost endless preaching about condoms failing, or people ruening their lives because they made a girl pregnant.  i'm not advocating sex at a young age, but you can't confuse a kid so badly about what it is.  seriously, because of the frequency and the speed that my parents would change the channel when violance or sexual content came on, and what they talked to me about, i literally thought that having sex was worse then commiting murder up untill age 18. (when i finally escaped to college, only to find out that i was still almost just as traped)        i have an INTJ personality type, it's statisticallly the least likely type to get married, and the most socially aquward.  the reasons for this varry anywhere form me being more logical and not as good with emotions, to unique problem solving skills.      the fourth problem that i'm going to list here, is that i'm not quite a genius.  don't make any assumptions about this statment unless you know about IQ ratings, and the test itself.  four years ago at age 18 i scored 138, and i feel like i'm smarter now then i was compared to my peers back then.  also, you should be awhare that any online IQ tests are complete bullshit.       http://www.kids-iq-tests.com/iqscores/13...    (itsa kids IQ sight, but the information is good)      ok, now that you have an idea of what kinda past i'm dealing with, and feel like you want to smash your head into a wall for the next hour out of boredom, i will bring you up to speed abit on my current situation.        i'm not jsut a virgin, i've never kised a girl, or even huged one that i was attracted to, and i've never been on a first date.  really though, at this point, sex is about the last thing on my mind. it's the feeling of lonelyness, and the fear that i will never have a family of my own.  nobody to care for, and nobody that cares for me, just spells "total failure at life."      i have been trying though, i quickly learned not to bother the more socailly capable girls out there.  i even found one girl that i swear had a terrible case of        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal...       i don't really concider myself having a strong case of this, becuase of my storng desire for social interaction as well as my strong fear. but whatever...everything is relitive.      the point is that i've specifically found girls that mental problems or those that exibit similar social disabilities to me, but i didn't have any luck.          i'm not bad looking by any means. i might not be considered cute, but i'm 6'1", riped, cut, have wavy hair, and look almost exactly like [link] but my jaw is a little more rounded.       http://z.about.com/d/atheism/1/0/g/Q/Are...    (not the cupid...the other guy)       i have talked to some of the more extroverted guys that i know, but they all told me, "O, that's just really bad luck man. Don't worry about it, it will happen when you least expect it."  (these are the people that doen't even try to sleep with that girl from that party, but it kinda just happens anyway[and every freaking night too]) Which is probably the least helpfull advice you could give somone like me.  it would make me less of a protagonist, just sitting in the corner stairing at that girl, wondering why she hasn't spontaniously decide

20090128230821AAmNFjs	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How weird would you find it to see gossip from your high school, in the news and Time Magazine?	Ok, so in high school, I heard that this one guy in my school had been in a relationship with a 45 year old guy.  I remember thinking it was a little odd that a 45 year old would want to be with a high schooler and that a high schooler would prefer a 45 year old over someone younger, but I haven't thought about it much since then.        Within the last couple days, I saw that there was some fan group for this guy on facebook and wondered why.  It appeared that it was because he's a model now.  However, today, my husband informed me that it was because of some scandal involving the mayor of Portland.  Apparently the 45 year old that this high school guy was in a relationship with, is now the mayor of Portland.  It's a scandal now and it's in the news and in Time magazine.  How weird is that?  What feels to me to be high school gossip is in Time magazine and easily found though a google search!

20060910192646AA1DcA0	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Challenge question?	Modern solar panels are approximately 10% efficient. That is 10% of the energy in sunlight striking the panel is actually converted into useful electricity. During the day, approximately 2.5x10^27 photons of visible light strike a square kilometer of earth every second (1 photon of visible light has an energy of about 4x10^-19 joules).      The Watt is a unit of power. 1 Watt is equal to 1 Joule per second. A 100-Watt light bulb therefore requires 100 joules of energy per second to stay lit.      Based on this information how big a solar panel (in square meters) is required to provide 350 Watts of electric power on a typical day?      I got 35 square meters but its wrong. What do you get?

Many people(esspecially in US) say teachers are stupid,parents are stupid,government are stupid and not enough money for the school.But deep within me i think the real main cause is the attitude of a bunch of stupid school students that started all these nonsense.They skipped school,they smoke weeds and cigarettes,they drink booze,they won't do their homework,they're bullying other students for nothing,they loot,they steal.When this is happening,who's to blame?Parents?Teachers?State Gov?NO!!!..The students themselves are the main culprit of all these nonsense.I'm not an American citizen so I'm quite baffled with this scenario.Why parents,teachers and state officials kept blaming eachother for a mistake that they did'nt do?Why don't they put a full focus of the level of diciplines among the school students?Are they affraid of the students?Perhaps they were fooled by the distorted facts in Fox News i guess?Are they affraid that the so-called "The American Way" might died out if student's dicipline were the main focus here?

Describe any volunteer, extracurricular activities, or work experience in which you are or have been involved in the past two years.               During my high school career, I have volunteer many places. When I was devoting my time at the elementary school, I got to work with many kids. While I was at the elementary working, I was put in charge of a game booth. I was able to meet new people and to learn to communicate with others better.    Devoting my time at the library, I get to tutor the little kids and I get to help with the other staff members with the books.  It doesnt matter if Im volunteering at the library or at a elementary school, I still get to work with other people and develop a newer skills.         If you can make this better or even just correct my grammar  that would be great!    Please and Thank you in advance :]

20090129024222AAxTqrk	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What is the difference between a Diploma and a Degree in the context of a University?	Now, keep in mind, I'm in New Zealand, studying overseas isn't really an option.      I was looking at Massey University's courses (Still a good 2-3 years off needing a Uni, but still), and I noticed that some of the subjects they offered only had diplomas available. These were in subjects like Journalism Police Studies and Photography, to name a few, whilst other subjects like Nursing had Bachelors degrees available.      I always thought that a diploma was something they handed to you when you finish highschool (They call it "college" here in NZ, go figure).      Basically, my question is, what is the difference between the two? Will a diploma holder be passed on, whilst a degree holder will be more sought after?   Because, while I know photography doesn't require a degree or anything, it'd be nice to have something that could give me a slight boost, and if a diploma is somehow a lesser form of education, I think I might have to study elsewhere.      Here's a link to Massey's Diploma courses:    http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/study/pro...
