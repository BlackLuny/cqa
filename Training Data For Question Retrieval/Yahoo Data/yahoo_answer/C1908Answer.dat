7vh5fOeRaa	Your Dell Dimension 8100 uses PC600/800 RDRAM, so unfortunately your PC2-5200 is NOT compatible with your old system.  As opposed to other answers here, your newer PC2-5200 memory sticks won't even fit in the Dimension 8100's memory slots.    Also, a quick check of Crucial.com shows that Crucial doesn't even sell this kind of memory anymore:  http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.a...    RDRAM was a proprietary type of memory that was initially the ONLY type of memory you could use with early Pentium computers.  It was licensed from the Rambus corporation and was supposed to be superior to all memory types.  Unfortunately, Rambus kept the prices artificially high and RDRAM quickly fell out of favor to DDR memory which was MUCH cheaper and eventually became faster.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAM    It is becoming very difficult to find RDRAM anymore... here's one site:  http://www.memorystock.com/memory/DellDi...    And, as  you can see, the price of RDRAM is still unreasonably high... a 1GB kit (2x 512MB) still sells for roughly $200.  You can buy 4GB of DDR2 memory for less than half of that!    So you're probably out of luck trying to upgrade that old system.  It's stuck using an archaic, and quickly fading, form of memory.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Go to crucial.com and look them up by model number. They're tell you what kind of ram goes in each one. My guess is that it won't work, but I could be wrong.|`|WQ0DzpByaa	Memory is backwards compatible.  If there are cards with two different speeds, everything runs at the slower speed.  On the 8100, go to www.crucial.com and run the Memory Scan.  It will tell you what you have, and recommend what kind to use for upgrade or replacement|`|KlShAO6Jaa	Actually why did you want to reduce the speed of your new computer?  I think the RAM will work, but you need to compare them if you don't know the model number of the RAM.

If the webserver(apache or IIS) handles the subdomain request correctly, you should be able to see the correct website.    WindowsXP host file location:  c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

RXM43vvGaa	In order to remove World of Warcraft safely from your system, you will need to use the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel to uninstall the game.  If the game is not listed in your Add/Remove Programs, you can find an uninstaller at "C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft".  If you are unable to find the uninstaller at that location, then you will have to manually uninstall the game by deleting the application directory where the program was installed.  The default location is "C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft".    Also make sure to delete any Temporary install files that may be interfering.    - Deleting Temporary Files    Whenever programs are installed in windows temporary files are created that are only needed for the installation. If there has been a problem during the installation these can sometimes become damaged.    To remove these temporary files:  1) Go to the Start menu and choose Run  2) Type %temp% in the Open: text box and click OK  3) When the Temp folder appears go to the Edit menu and choose Select All  4) Go to the Edit menu and choose Delete  This will delete all Temporary files that could be interfering with the installation.

Answers in indirectly encouraging the nations schoolchildren to access blocked websites whilst in school.  School computers are provided by taxpayers exclusively for school work.  Websites such as MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites are exclusively leisure activities which have no place within the school environment.  For a respected site such as Yahoo! Answers to provide the means for schoolchildren to exchange information about proxy websites (for the purpose of accessing blocked websites on school computers) is considered to be unacceptable and unpatriotic.  It is considered that Yahoo Inc. has a moral duty to require Yahoo! Answers to ban questions pertaining in any way to accessing blocked websites in the school environment.

Instead, Go for the X1600    http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...    I disagree with Smashedsmurf's suggestion as you can see that the MINIMUM is 400W for 8800Gt and 400-450W for the 9600GT. Plus, the minimum means that your power supply must continously provide that much, not the maximum.  Sorry i'm not totally sure if your power supply can handle it.     Good luck !

RXM43vvGaa	Duplicate question? Well, same answer:      You cannot. An ip address is just the address of the computer over the Internet  The dns fixes the domainip resolution and the apache(or IIS) handles the web page to show up by the domain  If you can access examplesite123.org by ip, this means the apache handles all the requests to that ip by default to the examplesite123.org  To access a subdomain by ip, if the subdomain isn't in any public dns, you can add it to your windows host file and it will resolve for you and only you.  If the webserver(apache or IIS) handles the subdomain request correctly, you should be able to see the correct website.    WindowsXP host file location:  c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
zMO4eg2Haa	Don't make this any harder than it has to be.  You do not need any casts at all.  All you need is to replace your 1's with 1.0's.  This will turn them into doubles automatically.  Everything will fall out naturally.     int answer = ((P * nc * S) + W) * (1.0 + 1.0 / nd);    When you involve a number of higher precision in a primitive operation, your compiler will automatically cast the other variables to the higher precision.  Technically, only the final 1.0 is required.  Now, you may get a warning about loss of precision since you are trying to cram a double into int.  If you don't like it, then this is your one spot for static_cast().  If you want to round instead of truncate, add 0.5 to your answer before casting.    I put a link in the reference to the working program if you want to play with it.|`|838TBllwaa	Pretty much any way you cut this you aren't going to get a pretty result.    The format for static cast is like this:    static_cast ( variable );    So you could, cast each of the float points to an int before being used in the calculation, but you will get an answer that is very off, because P would save as 0, W would be 1, etc. ( Casting a float to an int truncates everything after the decimal ).    You could do something like:    N = static_cast ( ( ( P * nc * S ) + W ) * ( 1 + 1 / nd ) );    which will work, but if your equation came out to say 3.204, the answer would be truncated to just 3.    You aren't going to get a perfect answer by keeping N an int, but that's about as close as you can get.|`|IqxFo2u7aa	you'll get rounding errors if you don't cast everything as floats  you're ok using the old c style casts if you want "(float)N" etc. - it'll be the division by nd that'll mess it up    the format as the other guy said for static_cast is... static_cast(N)

So unless you can prove that you didnt violate anything & were very active like no longer then a couple weeks between log ons then you have only yourself to blame.

Laptops generally dont make good gamers unless you spend a small fortune on one.|`|3dv7Qdoxaa	Well you listed more than one game so I don't know which one has the 2.6 Ghz processor as the minimum. But, it should play alright. You might not be able to play at full settings in some of the games but they should not be unplayable. If I were you, I would save my money and get a more respectable gaming laptop if it will be used for a lot of gaming. As you probably know, games are always going to have higher and higher requirements as they are released so getting a low end laptop right now would not be a good idea if you want to play good games on it in the future.

Hope you'll find this answer useful...|`|SqLIZQN5aa	Yes, I agree, Macs are great. Don't go for a a Mac mini, though. Those are very slow compared to the notebooks. Also, you can turn an existing mac into a tablet with ModBook, or purchase an external tablet, which would be great for graphic design.|`|tX6NbeQmaa	The Macbook Pro/Macbook (Aluminum or white) would be great for that.|`|RQfCmCrsaa	Macbook Pro.  Yes its expensive and huge but powerful with lots of storage.  For a computer a Dell XPS 420 is powerful and not very expensive.  Also check out www.ibuypower.com.au as they have great computers but look in the gaming section as those are the more powerful pc's.  Hope this helps and happy choosing!|`|Qh0kKszkaa	I suggest that you purchase a mac, they come with great graphics cards and are very customizable. Some say to start out small when purchasing your first mac but I say get what ever suits you. Given the credentials I would go with the 15-inch: 2.53GHz MacBook Pro. Yes it is a pricey machine but it will definitely last. If this is too much then consider the MacBook line. Mac's are what everyone uses for graphic design and they have a wide range of software available on the OSX platform. Do remember that if you have applications that you like and or need to run then you can install windows on a mac. My personal favorite is VMware fusion. If you are a student then make sure you buy when apple has their student promotions and get a student discount from apple by bringing your student I.D. to your nearest apple store or select your school from the apple website if you choose to purchase the computer online. I hope I helped, best of luck!|`|S1IPVvawaa	Okay- everyone is saying Mac- I guess they didn't look at how much you're wanting to spend. You are not going to get a powerful enough Mac for that price- you'll get bottom barrel- not nearly what you'll need to do anything. I work on both Macs and PCs (for over 10 years)- people are so passionate about one or the other, but trust me, there's no difference. There used to be, but not anymore. When you ask a Mac devotee why, they really don't have an answer- it's just that it's been an industry standard for years, so everyone is convinced that is the way to go, but they don't really have a reason why. Not to say that there is anything wrong with Macs- they are great machines, just too expensive when you can get the same results with a PC. And with the new opentype fonts, there isn't even the font issue that there used to be if you have to deliver native files- which most people want PDFs anyway, so it's really not an issue if you have a PC and the other person has a Mac. I just purchased a top of the line Dell laptop and to run what I needed to run well, I spent about $1400. I also just upgraded my desktop for $200 in order to run CS4 and bought an external drive (1T- enough storage space to last me until I die) for $125. I would try to upgrade your current computer if it's possible. And for your storage space get an external drive. You don't want to keep all your art on your computer- what if you have a crash, virus, etc.? If you want to spend the money, Dell has some suggestions of what to go with for graphic designers, or one of their reps can help you build what you need and try to stay within your price range. I built both of my computers through Dell, focusing on stability, durability, and performance. Not necessarily spending money on the latest "cool" features, but on getting a good, solid machine.

T17pbHVJaa	None should work, even if they were created 2 minutes ago, they still should not work.    School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.    Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.    All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.     You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.

dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, stuff that hides well, deeply rooting itself in your system. Anti-virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Download the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as this malware may block you from downloading the protection. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as an alternative for solution A.    Trying MBAM alone is not enough, you need a COMPLETE solution.    Here is one (use programs in the order stated): A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results.    Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart - The log is automatically saved and can be viewed by clicking the Logs tab in MBAM ).    B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush every single possible accumulated junk in ALL browsers. As you explore the web, browsers stores information about your browsing. You should delete that information from time to time.     Method One (now):   In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox, go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (in the future - about every two weeks for normal use of the internet - every week for heavy use):    In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then click Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do the following steps (in order)  a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  Finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In Firefox, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes and then click on the clear private data now button.      Note: You should close your browser when you're done to clear cookies that are still in memory.  For older versions of the programs or for other browsers, check help files for guidance on doing the cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( here is a guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and an article for Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Install this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files (there are always some) and use it in "Windows safe mode" (for a better cleanup).    4) put order in your drive with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. ( see part 3 )    6) After this, if you don't have an anti-virus scanner, use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and if you have a GOOD one, make sure your virus database is updated.    ( A word of caution, be sure to read all help files completely so that you can apply fixes right the first time ! )    With this, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Stay away from AVG free (CRAP) and Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware themselves)|`|5aoAcXDGaa	reinstall your OS|`|EI79kH1zaa	Had same problem  Go to Folder Options, uncheck View hidden and system folders.

2LHgmq97aa	It does not make the Mac better..     With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware. Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...     A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share..     The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,     If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:    Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:    1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...

Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.

What if, for example, you wanted a $499 laptop to just do some basic functions in Windows? Why would it then be better to be a $1099 Mac just to install Windows on and then track down and install all the drivers yourself?    It all depends on your situation.    Some of us don't need Windows or Mac.|`|btEpZn71aa	Correct me if I'm worng, but I believe it was PCWorld that determined that Mac hardware ran Windows more efficiently than most PCs.  So yes, given that you can install both Windows and Mac OS X on the computer, that would make the mac better.|`|laofAjTAaa	in effect yes, but you can also get a nice little package called Kalway which is a modded version of osX Leopard - i think the issue overall is the price though, you get more from a PC dollar for dollar|`|RyvKws7Laa	Yes, when using Boot Camp you are running Windows natively.  Its just as if you had bought a IBM clone and installed it on there.  And your OS X installer disc comes with all the necessary Windows drivers too!    In a variety of benchmark tests, the Mac Pro (tower) vs HP x8600 (work station), the Macs outperformed the HP's when both ran Windows.  So yes, Macs are the best Windows computers out there.  But Mac still have all their own issues and limitations.    If you're actually doing a OS X vs Windows decision there's a lot more to consider.  For some people Macs will suit them extremely well.  But for others Windows is the far superior choice.  Its not about what the Internet winboys and macboys think, its about what suits you and your needs.  That is far more important than just numbers or opinions.  I like Mac, but I don't think its good for everybody.    Edit:   If you run Mac OS X hacked on an IBM clone you are still protected from viruses yes.  There is no Mac OS X virus to date.  But you are not protected against trojans/spyware.  There is not a lot of such for a Mac, but it does exist.  Wiki the difference between Virus/Trojan if you don't know.    Alternatively, if you run Windows on a Mac using Bootcamp, your computer is 100% vulnerable to all the Windows viruses while you are running Windows.  Its not the hardware of an Apple computer that keeps the virus threat down, its the operating system.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The choice of OS depends entirely on what you want to run.  If everything you want to run is available on both Mac and Windows, then having the ability to boot either OS is a waste of time and resources.  If you have some essential applications that run only on Mac, and others that run only on Windows, then you might be able to justify a dual-boot configuration.  Otherwise, it makes more sense to install just the OS that you need.    Having a dual boot configuration is like having two cars, and driving one home to pick up the other every time you want to change radio stations. In other words, it's a pain that most people would probably be happier without.    And Macs don't protect you from viruses; it's just that fewer viruses are written for Macs, since so few people use them.|`|s38AMdbhaa	HAHAH! Yeah right... Macs are so bad, AND overpriced.

Try other speed tweaks    Press Windows Key + Pause/Break Key  Look and see if it says  Physical Address Extension at the bottom.  If it does and you are on 32bit Windows,it will slow your PC down.  You don't want to use "Physical Address Extension" because it will not work.  It is a memory addressing scheme that is only useful on Xeon systems running Servers on 32bit Windows.    Go to BIOS and disable "Execute Disable Bit"  If your BIOS has "NX bit" disable it.    These perform the same function.    After disabling it and Windows loads press Windows Key and Pause/break again and make sure it no longer  says Physical Address Extension.      Turn off Indexing  This is good for laptops as it will reduce extra drive activity and make your battery charge last longer.    1.Click Start, type services.msc in the search box and press Enter  2.Double click the Windows Search entry from the list of services  3.Change the Startup type: to Disabled, and click the Stop button to stop the service. Then click Apply      Disable Indexing on Drives  This method allows users to selectively disable indexing on certain drives which rarely used or searched. However, it may take a long time to apply new attributes to all files, folders and sub-folders to exclude them from indexing.     1. Open Windows Explorer from Accessories.  2. Right click on the drive (or drive letter) that you want to turn off the indexing.  3. Select Properties on the contextual menu.  4.

KNppmXiXaa	When you power up the computer, the BIOS runs through a few initialization steps before attempting to boot the operating system.  During that period (few seconds), you can put the CD into the drive.  One thing worth noting is that the BIOS must be set to optionally boot from the CD/DVD drive prior to the hard disk, otherwise it will ignore the CD/DVD drive at boot.  As each BIOS may differ, I can't really say what the exact sequence is for yours but generally you press a key during startup to interrupt the normal boot sequence.  On some BIOS's, it is the , , , or  key.  You'll need to refer to your system or motherboard manual for more specific instructions.    As an alternative, if you really want to insert the CD without power, look for a small hole below the CD/DVD drive tray.  Use a straightened paper clip (or similar small but sturdy long implement) to manually open the tray.  This isn't necessary for what you need but does technically allow loading a CD before it is powered.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Have the CD in your hand as you turn on the computer and put it in immediately the initial manufacturer splash screen comes on.

nlQdROaKaa	Uh buy a router dude.... linksy routers are dirt cheap. 15 bucks i think.
KylTfJpZaa	WI THAT STEALS
dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|5fkqsnBJaa	You can try and see if McAfee will run in safe mode. But the virus has probably disabled McAfee's ability to update and if that is the case, your McAfee is now effectively useless.    To access Safe Mode, reboot then repeatedly press the F8 key at the first screen. The screen will look strange, but don't panic. This is normal in Safe Mode.     Otherwise, I suggest you try Avira AntiVir Rescue System:    "Avira AntiVir Rescue System is a Linux-based application that allows accessing computers that cannot be booted anymore. Thus it is possible to:   repair a damaged system, rescue data, scan the system for virus infections."    Download it on your computer (if you can) and burn it to a disk, if not use another computer to download it. Then boot your machine using the disc. You may need to change the boot order in your bias setup to have your computer boot from your CD/DVD drive first. Depends on how you have your machine setup. Most new computers have no floppy and will boot from the CD/DVD drive first.    Free:  http://www.free-av.de/en/tools/12/avira_...

Instead use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... )      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner and two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) but have at least one of each (for security).

Ensure the drive is visible there, under MASTER or SLAVE drives - this is usually in the first option.  Bios will also tell you if it is CD or DVD by the product code.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Some DVDs can be unplugged from the laptop to allow a floppy drive or extra battery to be fitted instead, usually a lock slider on the bottom somewhere. If that's the case unplug and re-insert it to be sure its properly connected.    Some viruses disable cd\dvd and system restore so check anti-virus and scan system.    Even if the DVD drive is faulty, the system usually still sees it.    Check with your friend who may know more.    You would have to reload windows from CD or maybe a memory stick, then download any un-found drivers from the manufacturers web site and install them to restore it, its worth doing a print screen of hardware manager before restoring so you know what should be there.

46OYLEXWaa	Make sure the video does not exceed 10 mins and..    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|s38AMdbhaa	*Face Palm* You don't need to convert it to .flv, leave it at .avi and upload it!|`|G965la4uaa	upload them as wmv use windows movie maker!!!!!!!|`|cpavWbc3aa	how big is the file? depending on your connection speed and file size to upload a video very well could take all night.

DjGEJfaPaa	Windows Movie Maker is currently the most popular choice for free video editing software but it doesn't always work very well. There's a new free video editing application that is much better.    VideoSpin is a brand new tool that allows you to create your own movie clips in minutes using your own videos and pictures.    The top 3 video edting software choices for the PC is Ulead Video Studio, Adobe Premiere Elements and Sony Vegas. These programs are not free, but you can download a free trial from their Web sites.    If your looking for free video editing software other than VideoSpin take a look at my first source.

So it is whenever that area deems it necessary to pay for a new satellite image to be taken.

And I think that world of war craft is an online game so he probably gets all into it because he has friends that he plays with on there, too, or people that he met through it so it's like hanging out with your friends..    but i'm not defending it at all, i hate when guys get so wrapped up in ANYTHING unless it's me =)|`|qml7X9Qiaa	Ok, it seems your getting confused between reality and fiction.

Cleaning the computer now requires you to follow these steps, because modern viruses and spyware entrench themselves in files that your computer needs in order to run:    1. Virus-check your data files (not application files-- you have installer CDs for those).  2. Back up the data files, getting them off your hard drive.  3. Get your original operating system CDs that came with your computer.  4. Boot your computer from the operating system CD.  5. Select the option that erases your hard drive and then reinstall your system software.  6. Turn on your software firewall that came with your operating system.  7. Reconnect to the internet, and download *all* Windows updates, no matter how long it takes.  8. Reinstall your application software, and update the applications as much as you can.  9. Reinstall your data files.  10. Create a limited user account on your system that does *not* have administrator access, and web surf only from this account.    Yes, this is a pain in the butt. No, there is no other way. No, antivirus and antispyware programs cannot fix this problem on its own.    So, what do you do in the future?    1. Never click on links you find in an e-mail.  2. Never open an e-mail attachment, ever.  3. Only download files from a reputable website that you know is on the up-and-up.  4. Never use bit-torrent and other file-sharing programs.  5. Never use an unsolicited drive-checking site.  6. Turn off all java and java scripting by default, and only enable java and java scripting for sites that you know you can trust.  7. Never read an unsolicited e-mail, and delete spam immediately. It is possible to be hacked by reading an e-mail alone.    Please adhere to the 'dont's' I provided above, because you will have to repeat the cleaning steps that I listed first *every time you get infected.* Anti-spyware and anti-virus programs are good to have, but they are a second line of defense. The best way to protect your system is you, and changing your behavior.    Good luck!|`|T3US5mzWaa	Not used it, but I do recommend Spybot S&D from http://www.safer-networking.com/    It is free and keeps your computer safe from spyware and adware.    Hope this Helps.

KlRo6JLQaa	Tell your parents what happened, if it was an honest error you don't have to act like you are guilty.|`|BsIAvIe0aa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	I wouldn't recommend going without Antiviris. I always got spyware on my computer in the past. I recommend getting Faronics Deep Freeze. It actually "freezes" your computer in its current state and resets it everytime the computer is turned off. I just got that program and I did a clean reinstall of Windows XP, installed my programs, and then installed Deep Freeze and my computer has been running fine ever since (even with Norton installed!). I just save my documents on my external hard drive, since drive C: is frozen. Once my Norton subscription runs out, I'm probably getting rid of antivirus all togther since the computer will automatically delete any viruses or malware when the computer shuts off. It's a lot of work reinstalling Windows XP and installing all the programs over again but it pays off because I basically have a brand new computer everytime I start my computer up. The only thing bad about Deep Freeze is if you need to install updates in the future, you have to "thaw" your computer so the updates will stay. So... my suggestion is to either get antivirus or reinstall Windows and install Deep Freeze. Best of luck!!! (And if you are afraid to reinstall Windows, don't be, its not too bad, just make sure you have all software product keys (including Windows) and just back your files up and you will be good to go!!)|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	I can.

If you did nothing but go to say CNN or ESPN and never downloaded a file you might be okay. No one can prevent everything on their own.    I don't see why you're asking this question. If you have a problem with too much software to prevent problems then simply find a couple very effective and very streamlined protection options.

DGA5Rtc4aa	You need to work out how to raise more cash.  3D animation is a heavy user of all resources: CPU, RAM, HD, etc.  If you buy an under-specified machine it will drive you to despair.  It will be slow, lack smoothness, and is more likely to crash.      You could contact the college you'll be studying at.  They may be able to advise on the spec.s.  They may also have a purchase deal worked out with suppliers.  I say this on the assumption that the course is at a conventional college or university, and not a private "college" charging a high price for a short course.  I would advise you to avoid this type of college.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Low cost and 3D animation usually don't go together.  3D animation is one of those things that gobbles CPU and video horsepower.

haNTxT2Yaa	When you hit delete, it doesn't remove the file from the hard disk, it just marks the area of the disk that the file was on as writable.  That means that the data is easily recoverable until that part of the disk is overwritten.    If a file has been deleted a long time ago, and files have been copied and moved around on the disk a lot since (which happens with windows anyway, as it has dynamic virtual memory which is constantly changing files on the hard disk) then it is very unlikely that it will be possible to recover it.  However, a recently deleted file can be easily recovered if someone wishes to find it.|`|2WMccHeRaa	Nope sorry once you deleted something it only keeps a record of it doesn't actually keep the file. try checking the recycle bin because you are able to to restore it from there because it hasn't been permanently deleted.    Hope this helped|`|yLC5WYRMaa	He's right. Simply deleting files is not enough. You need a software computer files eraser to be sure they're gone for good. Otherwise, even a non techie could recover incriminating deleted files from your computer without much effort. You can try this one for free:    http://www.delete-and-erase.info/delete-...|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	One way to make sure that you can never recover accidentally deleted files is to defragment the hard drive.  It works if you want them to be unrecoverable too.  There's a program (PhotoRec) that might be able to recover pieces of pictures here and there, but you can also run a "shredder" that's capable of shredding unused space.  That'll keep the files from anyone but Homeland Security (if your files are worth spending tens of thousands of dollars to recover).|`|VWBXCQrIaa	The drive is divided up into allocation units where the data is stored. There is a FAT (File Allocation Table) on the drive that is used to denote used storage units so they are not overwritten. When you delete a file, the FAT table is altered to allow the drive to use the space for something else. Until it is used, the data sits there.  There are any number of scrubbing programs which will clear any unused allocation units.

AA11611248	If there are more than one computer in use on your network, or there are many other users in your immediate geographic area that are online at the same time these situations would explain your connection problems.

KlRo6JLQaa	Learn C first.  C is a better programming language and it teaches you things that you wouldn't learn in Java that would make you a better Java programmer (if that makes sense).|`|faT4MyVkaa	C isn't object oriented, and has a few more difficult concepts like pointers and memory management. I would suggest Java because it is easier on some details, and it is object oriented which is very important.|`|w0p8zwt7aa	The Java for dummies book I had was awful.  It started out making you type a program that was way beyond anything beginning.  The program made it easy for you as you used it later in the book.  Did stuff like automatically declaring interger,  decimal, string types by the variables the book told you to enter.  Which to me declaring the types of variables is one of the most important things you need to do.    I have not looked at other Java books as I took it in college.      Also learn C first,  yes it's outdated but you get the idea.  Then decide if you want Jave, C , or something else. I started with VB 5.0 and even though it's very outdated now, the stuff I learned with it, is still valuable today.
E5mFWOqqaa	HP keyboards are fine. The size is pretty standard between keyboards, so there isn't really any truth to a claim that a company's keyboards on a normal size laptop are too small.

The keyboard is full size but no number keypad on mine (big deal).  It is integrated like a normal keyboard.    The "too small" problem is because thay probably have a 12 or 13 inch screen so the keyboard is SMALL also.    The HP laptop (notebook) comes complete with user help explaining all the keys, functions, 'n such.    I think you'll like it.    PS: HP is great with help and automatic updates when you register the computer.  You can also sign on to online classes that I've found very helpful.  ;-)
gpBicBEPaa	If youlike conforming and spending lots of money than go for it.|`|ijDgKdcxaa	I prefer a PC, they are more adaptable to programs than Macs are.  At one time all you could get was a Mac if you wanted a laptop.  Now there are a lot more choices.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Well, let me ask you a few questions to help you decide:    1. Have you ever run a limited user account in Windows? Do you want to do that all the time, or do you find that difficult?    2. Do you have a lot of money to spend?    3. Do you use any Windows-only software?    The answers to these questions are very important to your decision. If you like running Windows as a limited user (the only way to get some proper security in Windows), don't have a lot of money to spend, and use Windows-only software, you're probably better off with a Windows-based laptop.    If, however, you hate running Windows as a limited user account, have a lot of money to spend, and don't use Windows-only software, you're probably better off with a Mac laptop.    Oh, and one more thing:    4. Have you ever used a Mac before?    Some people use it and fall in love with it. They think it's a work of art. Others use it, find the interface awkward, and go running back to Windows.

D1zM63VZaa	hmm the only thing I can come up with is mayb you have some type of virus. Try downloading AVAST (avast.com). Get the home edition. It is free. Install it and then when prompted to register, do so (you just put in like a name and e-mail and they e-mail u a serial). Run a test. This might find infected files (delete them). If that doesnt work try googling for some spyware that will scan your OS (operating system). I dont have a specific on that.    Also idk about the pancakes, but would love to know!
TEHfjxGkaa	We had one guy running WF3 on XP64 because was already running 64 bit CFD software. The rest of us still use WF3 M110 & Ilink 4.3 on XP Pro 32 bit.    Unless you are working with with really large detailed assemblies, you don't need a 32 bit o/s.    If you do want to run WF on a 64 bit o/s, you will need to get hold of the specific Win XP 64 bit version of Pro/E.

zzFwZZtUaa	I don't know of one that will give you as much success as easily as ebay will. I sold my ps3 for 350 dollars and they only took $15. 45 to 60 dollars is not right. You should just sell it on ebay, and account for the $15 into the price of the item. Even if there was another site that was free, your item would probably sell for more than $15 less than it would have sold on ebay because of lack of exposure. So just go with eBay, it truly is the best. I hope this helps.|`|rCNRcF5waa	On Ebay, you really have to take into consideration how much it's going to cost to ship. Yes. It is going to take money out but you can always just add that to the shipping cost.  Though I'm not exactly a fan of Ebay.  I tried selling my handmade stuff on Etsy.com (handmade stuff only) and haven't made a single sale. I've sold two of them so far on Ebay but the only problem is I have to sell them cheaper than what I originally wanted. Because of the bidding deal.  It's really iffy. I know some people that are making sales off of myspace pages and seem to be doing alright. You just have to make sure you have a paypal account and make sure you have the money before you send the Wii.|`|peFufWeYaa	Yes there is a free alternative to ebay, if you wish to call it that. It is called ioffer and it's become very popular lately, since more and more folks are dissatisfied with ebay.    There is of course a fee, but only if it sells,  and it is much less than ebay, and many folks like ioffer because they get to set the rules about how they want to sell their stuff. The community and communication are much more friendly there.    If you want to sell your item with no fee whatsoever, probably the only way you can do this is thru Craig's list|`|Nwno6n70aa	u want ur cake and eat it too?  create the site!|`|lMZQJEsKaa	The only free alternative to E-bay that I know about is Craig's List.  Try CraigsList.com (not sure).|`|ZQ126bPqaa	Just make the shipping $400 silly ;)    Edited: Craiglist is not free.|`|o6NatVx7aa	try http://www.delcampe.com/    not as known as eBay but better value...|`|vr6EjHVUaa	well...  no, none that i can think of! :)|`|7sNWRxYNaa	http://www.kijiji.com/|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Er how do you think a site such as eBay acquires the funds to continue operating?  Any site claiming to offer a totally free service should be treated with suspicion because there has to be a catch somewhere.  If I had a store selling items on people's behalf, I would need to pay my staff, buy my stationery etc. etc. I could not possibly do it for free.  Therefore the seller would have to be charged commission|`|fOw6KzNuaa	yes    perhaps the better question to ask would be "Is there a free alternative to E-bay that doesn't suck?" because the answer to that... is no. most alternative ebay sites have a terrible design and an extremely small userbase making them completely useless, unless you're just using them for a e-commerce frontend.    so yeah, I put my cards with the guy that says "make your own site lol"|`|DILfadXCaa	in heaven there is  all yall gotta do is go to heaven  hehehehehehe (snort)  but first pay this wonderfall church couple thousand bucky dollas!

AA10375835	If you are running Office 2007, select the ribbon and then the Editor Options on the bottom.  Select the Display, and make sure the boxes are all unchecked.

Also, please make sure you are defining a DTD DOCTYPE.  If a DOCTYPE is not specified, each browser tends to do their own thing.

The old saying in computers still applies, "You can never have too much RAM or too big of a hard drive." Having said that, there are some some things that can be done to help improve Vista's performance on older hardware. Check the links listed below. These will not result in any miracle cures (nothing short of a newer, faster, more RAM/bigger hard drive computer will compensate for Vista's overhead) ; however, it should make your computing experience more tolerable. HTH.|`|A7miTF4taa	i'm not a computer whiz but my mom was having the same problem. come to find out she didn't have enough memory to run vista to it's full potential. you need at least 1 gig of memory to run at a somewhat decent speed but 2 gigs would be better. mom got another stick of memory to equal 2 gigs and she no longer has this problem.    hope this helps :)

XP or vista.    If XP:    The default Admin account might still be active. It's common for it to be.    At the windows login screen press CTRL + ALT + DELETE keys. A pop up box should appear asking for username and password.    Type in user: Administrator  Password: Keep blank, don't enter anything, just click on the login button.    If that works, then go to control panel -> users and you can change the password for your main account there.      If not, try this site: http://www.petri.co.il/forgot_administra...

6b732103367783f78c674ad4ce821550aa	There are many methods to do this.    One is to just overlay or softlight (blending modes) a blue layer over the image. However that has the tendency to change the light and dark ranges.    My favorite method is to make a gradient map. In the layers box, at the bottom, press the half black half white circle and select gradient map. (or go from Image>Adjustments)    Create a blue to white gradient and press okay.|`|0ggluTFdaa	In Photoshop. Go the the menu and chose Image-Mode-Grayscale.    Then go back and chose Image-Mode-Duotone. A pop up window will come up and you can chose to change the color from black to blue. Or add additional colors.    You change the color by clicking the square once the Duotone window comes up.

fE7zhp3Caa	Open-source software doesn't have to be free.  The two go hand-in-hand very well, but open-source licensing like the GPL only stipulates that the source code be made available at no additional cost not that the software can't be sold commercially.    For free open-source software, covering their expenses happens in a number of ways.  You can buy copies of various Linux distributions, usually for premade disks and possibly a printed manual, pay for support, or contribute in the form of a donation.  Sometimes the developers themselves will pay for operation costs out of their own pockets.    Most people contributing to free open-source projects do so simply because they like doing it.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Read this:  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/how-...|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Donations and real jobs.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Most of them don't make any money.

Illegal possession of dihydrocodeine can result in up to 5 years in prison and/or an unlimited fine."    Just thought you ought to know.|`|WeZcSZvKaa	A word of warning. It is extremely dangerous to buy drugs over the Internet. There is no regulations controlling them as regards the purity or quality control of them as people have found out to the detrimental cost of their health.    Drugs that have been seized by customs [because it is illegal to import drugs into the UK without a licence] and have been tested have found all sorts of illegal chemicals in them as well as the dosage makeup being all wrong.    Also I would think your Consultant and your GP would be not be very impressed you doing it. Especially if you have a bad reaction or side effects to them due to your normal prescribed drugs being taken as well.    Also it is illegal to have possession of A, B, C class drugs without having them prescribed to you in which they would be because of the dosages they would be in.    And yes I know what pain is because I have had five major operations including a spell of six weeks in ICU on high dependency drugs in the last six years.    Obviously contrary what answers you get on here, if you think it's worth taking a serious and grave risk to your health, your going to do it irrespective of what anyone says anyway.

6Yqfmc5eaa	Do you get an error message saying it's already in use by another person or program? If so, try closing that program before attempting to delete it. You'll probably find that the program in question is UTorrent itself, so make sure that torrent is disabled and try again. Try deleting it directly from the downloads folder without UTorrent running.    If none of that works, there's a handy little gadget called MoveOnBoot that can help you.    http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot...    Probably best to run a full virus scan after it's gone, just to be on the safe side. Don't forget to update first ;)

ANSWERS   ARE REALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE TRYING TO SUCKER YOU INTO BUYING   THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE, which is really insulting since you  cannot even access or watch videos.    It looks like lots of people are asking about YouTube screens  and players that are blank/white/black. Thus, I recently spent  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to come up  with is that there is no "definitive" solution out there. However,  there is 1 interesting factor in almost everything I saw: Firefox.    A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-  computerese" that I wouldn't dare recommend any 1 of those  potential fixes.    However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible  solutions, so check these out:    1) If you're using a Mac and have Firefox, then simply log out.    2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:  go to  Tools  Quick Preferences  Edit Site Preferences   Network tab  Browser Identification  Identify as Firefox.    3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).    4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet   connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote   that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left   corner of their browser screen.    Sorry, but that's all that I can realistically recommend for you.   If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,  feel free to type any of the following into Google's search box:  -- youtube "blank screen"  -- youtube "blank player"  -- youtube "blank box"  -- youtube "white screen"  -- youtube "white player"  -- youtube "white box"  -- youtube "black screen"  -- youtube "black player"  -- youtube "black box"    If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird:   Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary   Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has   solved 100s of people's YouTube problems, so why not your's.  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:    Internet Explorer 6:   Tools  Internet Options    Delete Cookies  OK   Delete Files  OK   Clear History  Yes    OK    Internet Explorer 7:   Tools  Internet Options > Delete...

RyvKws7Laa	Go for the biggest hard drive you can afford in your budget.  When hard drives fill up they become inefficient (sluggish and unstable).  So give yourself and your system some breathing space.  Music and Movies can eat up space quicker then you would think.  250GB may not be necessary for you though.  The 120GB for the White model is a bit small in my opinion, but it fully depends how much music you intend to stick on it really.  You want to try and keep about 10-20% of the capacity free.    As for the white one vs the aluminum one, go with what ever one you like better.  Go and check them out in a store.  Get the feel of the keyboards and trackpads.  Get a good look at them.  There isn't a huge difference in performance specifications, so go for what is most comfortable/appealing to you.  The new ones are all glossy so that might have glare issues depending where you normally sit.  But most people that bought that them are really liking them.    One caveat on the new ones though are that they are the first generation of a redesign.  So they are a little more susceptible to bugs.  Some people are having issues with their trackpads (supposedly fixed by a firmware upgrade though) and some with the power settings related to the new graphics chips (haven't heard a lot of complaints of such though so not much on the solution, if any, either).    But again, I would really not make this decision by reading online opinions only.  After you get your online feedback, you need to find a store that sells them so you can get a first hand look/feel for what you're paying for.|`|DWCBzH4xaa	It all  depends on  your   budget and what   you   will  be  using    your  mac book   for.  I  have  the  old  white  one with   1gig memory  installed and  it   works   fine  until  I  start  running applications  like adobe   photoshop  and lightroom, then  it really   gets    slow.    I  know   the  old     white      model  looks  cool  but  if   you   can   afford  it   i  would   advise   you  to     get  the   newer model as  its   a  lot     more  powerful but  if   you  cant  then       get  at  least    2  gig   memory   plus  a    100  gig     hard   drive.  you  can  always     increase   hard  drive  space   by  using  an   external   drive   so  concentrate  on     as  much   memory as  you  can   obtain  in   both   instances   and   you  cant   go  wrong.

rkuHaiV6aa	Look in Device Manager to see if the sound stuff is installed: Right click My Computer, and pick Properties. Then click the Hardware tab, then Device Manager.     Click the "+" in front of Sound, video and game controllers, and it'll open with 5 or 6 lines ...mine says:    If Realtek AC'97 Audio has a ! at it then it's not installed properly. If you right click it and look at properties and it says it is working properly then you can click on the troubleshooter.     Good luck.    If you've checked device manager and the driver is not there......  Get the CD that came with the Foxconn board and reinstall the Audio drivers. If that does't work, right click Sound, video and game controllers and Scan for hardware changes. It should then find the sound chip on the m/b and ask for it's driver. If it doesn't find it, it could be no good. Either ask Foxconn or look for a Foxconn forum you can post this to. Some of the Foxconn boards are cheapies and may not be reliable.

63dea0af362c7ae37f95513c44010c3caa	My own pc is connected to my tv and a monitor. I can use the tv as a second monitor and have info displayed on both just by dragging the windows about. I can even have a window that drapes across both monitors (which sounds kind of like what you're seeing).     I can tell Windows which one is the primary monitor - the one where the start button is and where all the windows start up. Both monitors show the same wallpaper image. So I think perhaps your version of Windows is now set to have 2 monitors like mine.     Right click on the desktop.  Select properties.  Select settings.  On my pc I can see 2 blue monitors (numbered 1 and 2) and can click on either one.  The settings options are independent for each monitor.  But importantly, I can see 2 options: use this device as the primary monitor; and extend my windows desktop onto this monitor.  I think you need to play around with these settings.    Well - good luck. If it's not that then I'll be interested in knowing what it is.    Oh - a reinstall (as the fellow above suggested) would fix things if all else fails. But it is time-consuming and you will lose any data if you haven't backed up.|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	I can tell you what the issue is dont know how to fix it though   It has to do with explore.exe a restore disk should fix it.|`|GPQmXritaa	Its possible that your computer is recognizing it as a second montior, so right click on the desktop and go to your display settings.  Click on identify, most likely it will put a big "2" on the screen, if so just go over to the drop down box and choose to make it the defult monitor or switch to default monitor.

46OYLEXWaa	Make sure the video does not exceed 10 mins and..    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|hlsLi9Omaa	If you aren't having any success try using Picasa;  http://picasa.google.com    It will manage the editing and uploading process for your videos.

There is no better or worse, just which is better for what YOU want to use it for.  :)|`|0clEZaFhaa	Both the PC and the Mac have their pros and cons--if you want to call them that.  <br>  <br>  The PC--Personal Computer--is just a generic machine that almost anyone can build.  Generally, today, most people think of a PC as a computer with a Windows OS on it.  That is not necessarily the case.  <br>  Pros:<br>    Since its generic, if one thing crashes, (say the video card) then you can find a video card that the motherboard supports.  Since its generic, you can also shop around at different locations, i.e. its not limited to only one place to purchase. <br>    Generally inexpensive.  As I've stated up there, they tend to be generic so...<br>  Cons:<br>    Generic PCs don't really run the Mac OS (Operating System) very well.  <br>    You can probably get some under-grade junk for it too.  Which brings me to the Mac.<br>  <br>  Mac.<br>  Macs are computers that are essentially built, sold, and designed AT Apple, inc. This is great because it means they have a set standard of machine, so you know you're not getting crapped out of money.  Runs the Mac OS and can also dual-boot (essentially have two operating systems) Windows or any other type of Operating System.  <br>  Pros:<br>    Dual bootability--whereas PCs can do this, they can't boot Mac OS very well.<br>    The Mac OS runs fine on it.  Tends to be used for Art-oriented things such as graphic design and video editing. <br>    Apple standard, so you don't get under-the-guidelines parts.  <br>  Cons:<br>    Since it has the Apple standard, you really can't fix them yourself.  You can't shop around compatible parts as easy.<br>    Also because of the standard, Macs tend to be quite expensive. <br>  <br>  All in all, it's really a preference.  If you're getting a computer for just normal office business, a generic PC will do you fine.  Windows is a more office-oriented OS.  If you're more into the creative, art-oriented, and are willing to spend the cash, I'd say go with a Mac.  Fact of the matter is, it probably won't need to be upgraded a bunch because of the Apple standard, and it tends to have better security.  <br>  <br>  I work with PCs alot, so if it were me, i'd probably get a Mac.  If i had the cash.|`|VjDseED0aa	mac. i used to use pc's and now i have a mac. i like it much more

uuDloQnCaa	Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|dkpIjt5jaa	There is no BEST solution, all have their pluses and minuses (be it paid or free versions), the best way to find the best for YOU is by doing research.    You can have a look at these reviews: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,233...      But here are my opinions (based on personal use):    Stay away from AVG free as it is CRAP ( In my long time at helping others, I have found it more defective than helpful ), it may be free but it has hiccups like the two errors that made the news recently on CNET, the first time it said that Zone Alarm (a firewall) was a virus and the second time, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose their Windows system (they had to issue apologies publicly for this one).    You should try the COMODO Internet Security (in free or paid version).  This is an Antivirus and Firewall combo. I have been using the free version for a while now and I have no complaints.    Check it here:  http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/  (free version on the left / trial for paid version on the right)    Over at Matousec (a security testing site), COMODO Internet Security came second (but was first if you only consider the free ones): http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewal...      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner and two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) but have at least one of each (for security). There is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware ( http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... ) is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams.     Spybot ( http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... ) is also a good choice if you use it regularly.    So for a cleaner, I suggest a free one http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).      ( A word of caution, with programs this powerful, be sure to read all instructions and help files completely so that you can apply fixes right the first time ! )|`|cqzZjRVwaa	AVG. Click my link.    Hope I helped!|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	Avira Antivir is great, when it comes across a virus it pops up straight away with a box, to either block it or put it in quarantine.  I have used all the other free ones but have come back to it because I feel confident that it is protecting my machine at all times. The next best one is AVG not quite as good but still does a very good job.|`|HOq5Urn1aa	You can protect your computer very well with free programs. The best way is to use a combination of anti virus and anti spyware programs          Anti virus and firewall pro  http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d...    or    http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  in combination with  http://www.pctools.com/firewall/    Spywareblaster  http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareb...

The only thing that really changed was the fact that you unplugged the speakers from the computer.

a68db0ecdc7955bb4e39dd1142f02298aa	Because your are dumb?|`|el8yX5q3aa	Firefox has a ‘feature’ that lets you select text with more visual feedback. I guess the little one must have been hitting keys and turned this on.<br>  <br>  Turning it off is easy! Press F7 to turn off caret browsing.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, type “about:config” in the URL area, then filter for “caret“. Change accessibility.browsewithcaret to “false”.<br>  <br>  and on another page..same thing in different words...<br>  <br>  If you want to get rid of this the solution is simple... press F7 (or read the stuff below if you are on a mac and your F7 key is mapped to something else.. if you press F7 it should work on your mac too but just in case it doesn't)! And if you want to turn it on again then you need to do the same as well. So now when you see blinking cursors on the screen when you are browsing through web pages don't freak out... it's just caret browsing.<br>  <br>  Oh and as Long Island Nurse points out, pressing F7 isn't the only way. You can also type in "about:config" in the address bar and then type in "caret" in the filter box and simply double click to change the option from "true" (which means turn on caret browsing) to "false" (which means turn off caret browsing).

jzex4ncSaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Computer or software bug: Taken from wikipedia.org<br>  A software bug is an error, flaw, mistake, failure, or fault in a computer program that prevents it from behaving as intended (e.g., producing an incorrect or unexpected result). Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made by people in either a program's source code or its design, and a few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains a large number of bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy. Reports detailing bugs in a program are commonly known as bug reports, fault reports, problem reports, trouble reports, change requests, and so forth.<br>  <br>  for more details click this -> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Debugging process: Taken from wikipedia<br>  Debugging is a methodical process of finding and reducing the number of bugs, or defects, in a computer program or a piece of electronic hardware thus making it behave as expected. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.<br>  <br>  for more details about debugging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging</a><br>  <br>  <br>  To get debugging done you should learn computer programming language and fix the code.<br>  <br>  <br>  And maybe you are interesting with the history of computer bug, you can find it here <br>  + <a href="http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/tek1/first_computer_bug.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/tek1/firs...</a><br>  + <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=30" rel="nofollow">http://americanhistory.si.edu/collection...</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2005/11/69355" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/n...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  -de|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	A bug is an error in a program<br>  <br>  Debugging is the process of removing errors<br>  <br>  You get debugging tools.Most softwares like Visual Basic have an in built debugger|`|69Aun81Aaa	In simple words, a bug is some error in the software program. Debugging is the process of analysis of the relevant code and fixing the error. <br>  <br>  Debugging is usually done by the author or maintainer of the program. Since you would not know about the internal details of the program, you should not worry about debugging it. Try any of the following options:<br>  <br>  1. Remove the program and re-install it. You may not get the bug after a proper and successful re-installation.<br>  2. Some programs make assumptions e.g. about the presence of a drive or a folder. If you can see the problem from the error message, you may try to fix the discrepancy in your computer.<br>  3. If the bug is simply a minor inconvenience e.g. just requires you to dismiss an error message, you may want to ignore it.<br>  4. If none of the above options work for you, contact the software vendor for support.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!<br>  Inder P Singh

d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	TRY this:...<br>  <br>  Windows remembers every single USB device that you have ever plugged into the PC and which port it was plugged into.  Device Manager normally doesn't show devices which aren't currently plugged into the PC even if you select show hidden.  <br>  <br>  Problems may arise when windows has set aside resources for these unconnected devices. (I had personal experience with this regarding USB/Serial adapters being assigned very high COM port numbers).<br>  Also the USB standard defines uniquie ID's for USB devices similar to NIC's however many manufactureres do not follow the standard. The results is that windows can get confused as to whch USB device is plugged in especially if there has been a history of many similar devices being plugged in to the PC.<br>  <br>  <br>  A potential fix is to use device manager and delete USB references to hardware that is not  currently connected to the PC.<br>  <br>  The attach link describes how to force device manager to display these items so that they may be deleted.<br>  <br>  A simple way is to click START>RUN type CMD click OK to start a DOS command window.<br>  Type  set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 <enter><br>  <br>  Do not close the DOS window but go to the control panel start the devicemanager , click view and select show hidden devices. <br>  <br>  OR YOU CAN START DEVICE MANAGER FROM DOS<br>  <br>  type Start devmgmt.msc <enter><br>  <br>  Leave the DOS window open when you use the Device manager. Close the DOS window only after you have finished using Device manager. <br>  <br>  EDIT<<< Once device manager opens  click VIEW and then click "Show Hidden Devices" >>><br>  <br>  Device manager will now display hardware which is not currently connected to the computer as lightly ghosted (grey)devices.  Expand the USB devices and delete all of  the "USB mass storage devices" which are not currently connected to the PC.  <<< You may be shocked to see how many USB mass storage devices are listed which aren't currently connected to the PC>>><br>  <br>  Reboot and try your USB memory again. The device should first reinstall itself and then work normally.  Since you deleted the hardware in device manager windows thinks it is brand new hardware and will reinstall drivers for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Another thing to try is a USB hub that has its own power supply.  This can address issues with  weak PC power or USB connector.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	It may be an issue with your particular make of computer !<br>  <br>  Go to your PC manufacturer's support web site and look around.<br>  <br>  They may have issued a fix if the problem is found on many of their computers.|`|E0chY1b5aa	Not much of an answer, but USB drives are a little different than network drives when the machine restarts.|`|x1YZgCCnaa	Some USB devices require a specific drive mapping and if you force it to another letter they don't work, I had a USB drive that would only work with H: I know it sounds screwed up but that's the way it was.

Now, your buddy in England has an ISP with a similar package... if he is hosting an FTP server for you to connect and download files, even though your downstream is 10mbps, you are limited to his upstream of 5mbps.  But now you have to take into account all the different hops between your computer and his...  its going to be significantly more than your buddy down the street.  So you're more likely to have a 'hop' somewhere in there that could potentially limit the transfer speed even more.<br>  <br>  Good sites to test download speeds for legitimate file transfers are sites that typically have beefy servers and backbones... like Microsoft.  Also, google "Speed Test" and you can find different servers to do a simulated speed test from to get results.
hx5myrabaa	This plan is in the form of grants and loans and even though it is targeted toward rural areas, keep in mind that is just is not as economical to put down the same length of broadband lines in a less densely populated area. If you lay 1 mile of high speed internet line in the suburbs, then you could add thousands of customers. The same amount of work in a rural area would be lucky to add hundreds. The companies that receive these funds are not stupid and will try as hard as they can not to spend on less productive means. I feel for you though, I live on five acres surrounded by five, ten, and twenty acre plots.

Q0VSGg4Maa	When I was your age, I learned 6502 Assembly Language on an Apple][+ computer.  Back then, development tools were NOWHERE near as advanced as they are now and most programmers back then actually knew how to program -unlike today, where most "programmers" have absolutely no business programming professionally.  Of course, in the 80's, learning Assembly Language at a young age wasn't a big deal.<br>  <br>  There's a free game making program called Game Maker which doesn't use complex programming, but you can get the feel of designing and creating your own games.<br>  <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/make" rel="nofollow">http://www.yoyogames.com/make</a><br>  <br>  DO NOT go to stupid places like Microsoft's XNA Creators Club or use Microsoft game libraries.  The only reason that Microsoft has that garbage is to sucker young people into being hooked on Microsoft's products.  Idiotic Microsoft garbage like .NET programming, frameworks, and game libraries  are just there so that stupid people become reliant on Microsoft products.  Any real programmer would know this.  <br>  (This is actually one of the many examples of why consumer education should be MANDATORY in school.  Too many people can't tell when they are being suckered into something stupid.)<br>  <br>  Also, any real Windows programmer with common sense would know that utter garbage like Object Oriented Programming, frameworks, COM objects, and interpreted languages like Visual BASIC and C# produce bloated, slow code.   Considering that most games are resource-heavy, you should use a decent language like C or C++ (without OOP) for programming anything that is CPU intensive.  Well, actually, Assembly Language is the real language to use, but you should learn C/C++ first.<br>  Anyone who says differently cannot program worth a crap and it can be easily proven by disassembling their piece of crap programs.<br>  <br>  You're old enough to learn programming with C or C++.<br>  If you want to learn Windows programming, then here's a decent plan:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah8NimvJX38SkPcfDfCsuoHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225124633AAkG1L4&show=7#profile-info-LrUb8qrZaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>   <br>  P.S.<br>  To get to be a game designer, you should get your foot in the door by being a programmer or graphics designer first.

Remove WiniGuard trialware to leave this malware no chance to harm your PC. WiniGuard trialware starts automatically with every Windows session and may also launch its free scan with false positives not waiting for your relevant order.

zg1lIy7Oaa	The World Wide Web (commonly abbreviated as "the Web") is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a Web browser, one can view Web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them using hyperlinks. Using concepts from earlier hypertext systems, the World Wide Web was begun in 1992 by the English physicist Tim Berners-Lee, now the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, while both working at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1990, they proposed building a "web of nodes" storing "hypertext pages" viewed by "browsers" on a network, and released that web in 1992. Connected by the existing Internet, other websites were created, around the world, adding international standards for domain names & the HTML language.

zorYTX59aa	If this is only the first time that this is happening<br>  to you, I wouldn't worry for too long. Many times <br>  every day, YouTube shuts down quite a lot of its<br>  servers without telling anybody so that they can <br>  update various stuff. <br>  <br>  However, I am beginning to see many questions <br>  just like yours on Yahoo!, so I recently did a ton <br>  of Googling, searching, reading -- poring through<br>  all variations, combinations & search results for:<br>  -- "youtube", "password"<br>  -- "username", "user name"<br>  -- "log", "login", "log-in"<br>  -- "sign", "signin", "sign-in"<br>  -- "doesn't let me", "does not let me"<br>  -- "won't let me", "will not let me"<br>  -- "can't log", "cannot log"<br>  -- "doesn't log", "does not log"<br>  -- "won't log", "will not log"<br>  as well as using the word "sign" rather than "log".<br>  <br>  After all that time, the best that I could come up<br>  with were these possibilities:<br>  <br>  1) There might be something awkward with your<br>  security software or firewall. Maybe it will not let<br>  you send out any of your personal information --<br>  or if you are rather young, it's possible that your <br>  parents have put a "block" on it.<br>  <br>  2) If you have Firefox, your problem may have to<br>  do with "cookies" or "exceptions". If cookies are <br>  "accepted", YouTube might be an "exception" --<br>  therefore you should "allow" YouTube to puts its<br>  cookies on your computer or "remove" YouTube<br>  from the "Exceptions" list. This is all accessible<br>  by clicking Tools > Options > Privacy.<br>  <br>  3) I don't understand the logic, but one guy on a <br>  forum discussion thread said he hit "CTRL" plus<br>  "F5", and for some reason it worked for him.<br>  <br>  4) There's a grainy YouTube video of an old lady <br>  with a rather clever idea: delete your passwords.<br>  Things can sometimes get "hairy" if a computer<br>  has many IDs and passwords. For example, I'm<br>  'inukjuak89' on YouTube, 'inukjuak90' on Yahoo,<br>  and other names on different sites. Also, all my <br>  passwords are different as well.<br>  <br>  Thus, one thing you may want to do is to check<br>  all your passwords. Believe it or not, she states<br>  you can actually see every one inside of Firefox. <br>  (I don't know because I'm a true devotee of IE6.) <br>  Here are her instructions, plus the YouTube link:<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=k0F90GAd17k" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=k0F90GAd17k</a><br>  <br>  5) The only other thing I can think of is "cookies".<br>  Perhaps a bad or false "cookie" has stuck itself<br>  in your computer and is sending out either false <br>  or wrong information. Even if you don't think that <br>  is the case, clear your "cache" of all its cookies. <br>  While you are at it, do the same thing with your <br>  "temporary internet files" and your "history" -- in <br>  order to reset everything. Whatever problem you<br>  may be having, this is something you should be<br>  doing at least every couple weeks:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  If any of these quasi-solutions solves your issue,<br>  please click my avatar and let me know, so that <br>  I may incorporate them into future YA questions <br>  similar to yours.<br>  <br>  Here are the links to two websites that you may <br>  find interesting if you use Firefox:<br>  <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies" rel="nofollow">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cook...</a><br>  <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies" rel="nofollow">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies</a>|`|VyXexH8gaa	Be more specific|`|v8WOULqmaa	omfg im having the same problem someone help!!!!!

It still loads some files onto your computer you are using. This means, even though it is on an external hard drive, it may not work or function when connected to a different computer because the other computer doesn't have the files it loaded onto your computer.<br>  <br>  If it is a program that does not leave any reference in the add/remove program on your computer, then it will probably work for you, since most of those keep their files intact and in their installed directory.

VdHKQMeXaa	With a few steps, you can have your PC computer running as fast as the day you brought it home.  Start-up Programs  Click run and type in msconfig. Click on startup items and uncheck any useless start up programs.   Or  Use the tool to manage your startup:   http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...    Turning Off Programs Already Running    Step1   Tell your computer what to do by pressing "Control Alt Delete" at the same time. When the autopilot is off and you're at the controls, you can also disable programs that are slowing down your computer.   Step2  Click the "Processes" tab.   Step3  View every program that is running on your computer at that time. You can also sort them by how much memory they are using, thereby finding the programs that are slowing down your computer overall. The third step is to look through the programs and identify the sluggish culprits.   Step4  Click the offending program or process, then click "End Process." You just sent it to an early grave.   Step5  Repeat Steps 3 and 4 as needed to increase performance.     Scan your Spyware/Adaware    Scan your computer for viruses and spyware.

You could also check out other programs such as Regclean.

BsIAvIe0aa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, stuff that hides well, deeply rooting itself in your system. Anti-virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Download the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as this malware may block you from downloading the protection. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as an alternative for solution A.      Here are solutions (use them in the order stated): A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results.    Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart - The log is automatically saved and can be viewed by clicking the Logs tab in MBAM ).    B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush every single possible accumulated junk in ALL browsers. As you explore the web, browsers stores information about your browsing. You should delete that information from time to time.     Method One (now):   In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox, go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (in the future - about every two weeks for normal use of the internet - every week for heavy use):    In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then click Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do the following steps (in order)  a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  Finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In Firefox, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes and then click on the clear private data now button.      Note: You should close your browser when you're done to clear cookies that are still in memory.  For older versions of the programs or for other browsers, check help files for guidance on doing the cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( here is a guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and an article for Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Install this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files (there are always some) and use it in "Windows safe mode" (for a better cleanup).    4) put order in your drive with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. ( see part 3 )    6) After this, if you don't have an anti-virus scanner, use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and if you have a GOOD one, make sure your virus database is updated.    ( A word of caution, be sure to read all help files completely so that you can apply fixes right the first time ! )    With this, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Stay away from AVG free and Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware themselves)

First, contact the seller and tell him the problem, and politely ask if he will accept a return or an exchange because his items were not as described.  If he says no, tell him you are going to file a report, and then go ahead and do it.

Ask if he'll refund the cost of the broken one.  Always ask (nicely) for a refund.  If they refuse or ignore you , file a claim through PayPal.  I would act if they ignore your email for 3 days.    PayPal will either give your money back, or they will tell you what the next steps should be.    But, my guess is that the seller will work with you.  Don't be mean or nasty to the seller. Approach them nicely and see what they say.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Contact the seller and explain what happened.  See if they will either give you a refund or exchange it for something else.      To be honest, you could log a complaint with Ebay but as you left positive feedback they probably wont do anything because you have already said that you were satisfied with the purchase.

rkuHaiV6aa	You can use Wi-Fi to connect computers and TVs wirelessly. Because televisions do not ordinarily have Wi-Fi, you will need to install a separate unit between the computer and TV. One common solution is called a Wireless PC to TV system or [i[Digital Media Receiver. These connect with AV cable to the TV and supply Wi-Fi connections to any computer in your home.    Another wireless PC to TV connectivity option is to use Windows Media Center Edition (MCE). If you buy a Windows XP or Windows Vista PC with MCE, this has built in wireless connectivity support for streaming images to your television. Some also support TV tuner cards that allow your computer to receive television signals. Finally, you can extend the capability of a Media Center PC across an entire wireless home network by installing a Media Center Extender product like the LInksys DMA2100.     Good luck|`|ye1tS9a2aa	yes, you need a wireless card for the tv, and their not cheap|`|RyvKws7Laa	You need wireless HDMI.  It is not out yet.

But I don't do work at home. So OpenOffice, Firefox, and Thunderbird are fine for me.    At work, however, I use software that is not available for Linux or that has no good open source alternative.    It really depends on your needs. Some people can get by with open source alone. Others need proprietary software to get their work done.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Not exclusively, no.

I am a web designer and a women and no other web designer has been sexiest towards me, they have actually been impressed that I am in this field and how young I started.    But once again, this isn't a strong topic to talk about.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	After years of buying nothing but HP, I got fed up with cheap parts (that they charge a fortune for), customer disservice, tech unsupport and 3 laptops it doesn't pay to repair (and I can repair them myself).  I bought a Gateway P6860FX.  As someone who spent years designing computers, I'm not easily impressed by a computer.   I was impressed.  Not only was it a steal for the price, it's very well made, and very well designed.    When my wife's HP gave out, she bought a Gateway P7811FX.  I'm not only more impressed, I'm jealous.  (And this, after years of laughing at Gateway.)  It's even a better buy than mine was.  (HP can't touch it for twice the price, and their quality and support need a complete change of management to compete with Gateway.)    About the only thing I'm not impressed by is the video card on this one, but you're not going to use it for intense gaming, so that shouldn't matter to you - it's perfectly adequate for web surfing or watching movies.  You'll both probably be very happy with it.|`|3zGxlguhaa	It's way, way more than you even need.

Virgin Broadband (L Package) only get the superfast speeds at about 9% of websites.. as its regardless how fast your speed is its only good if the server of the site you visit offers the same speed.

Sometimes programs will have options where you can check off all the files types you want that program to be default for.

The boot up screen runs off of a small amount of memory on your motherboard, so that wouldn't be affected. Try taking out your RAM (search on Google for a way how, it's different on every laptop). Blow off the terminals, to remove any dust (don't spit on it though). Re-insert the RAM.     I hope it works for you! I had this problem when I was tinkering with my old laptop.    Make sure your laptop if off for this, I recommend unplugging it and taking out the battery. It shouldn't matter, but I always do it to be safe.    About the battery, the flashing light is a code to tell you something is wrong. I haven't found what your particular one means but some relate to the battery overheating.

dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, stuff that hides well, deeply rooting itself in your system. Anti-virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Download the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as this malware may block you from downloading the protection. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as an alternative for solution A.    Trying MBAM alone is not enough, you need a COMPLETE solution.    Here is one (use programs in the order stated): A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results.    Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart - The log is automatically saved and can be viewed by clicking the Logs tab in MBAM ).    B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush every single possible accumulated junk in ALL browsers. As you explore the web, browsers stores information about your browsing. You should delete that information from time to time.     Method One (now):   In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox, go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (in the future - about every two weeks for normal use of the internet - every week for heavy use):    In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then click Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do the following steps (in order)  a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  Finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In Firefox, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes and then click on the clear private data now button.      Note: You should close your browser when you're done to clear cookies that are still in memory.  For older versions of the programs or for other browsers, check help files for guidance on doing the cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( here is a guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and an article for Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Install this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files (there are always some) and use it in "Windows safe mode" (for a better cleanup).    4) put order in your drive with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. ( see part 3 )    6) After this, if you don't have an anti-virus scanner, use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and if you have a GOOD one, make sure your virus database is updated.    ( A word of caution, be sure to read all help files completely so that you can apply fixes right the first time ! )    With this, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Stay away from AVG free (CRAP) and Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware themselves)|`|mb7h0wDJaa	just get this I Recommend it it deletes any virus immediately and plus you dont have 2 sign up for it immediatley u have a 90 day trial     click this link:http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/i...|`|BsIAvIe0aa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|8szFciqnaa	Take Albendazole.

044IeGstaa	Always start with the 'Building Block' of a computer.    The MOTHERBOARD.    From the motherboard everything else will come.    This, deems what Cpu, (Processor), and ram memory you will use.    From the mobo, (Motherboard), you will also know what graphics interface you're looking for, for your graphics card.  All mobo's are going to the PCI-Express x16, expansion slot for graphics, and are going towards just using the PCI-Express 2.0 version.     Power Supply:  The main form factor used is the ATX design.  Once you get the Mobo, Cpu, and graphics card out of the way, then configure in how many optical drives, harddrives, and case fans you're going to use. Going to throw in some cold cathode lights? Add the wattage needed for them also. Wireless ethernet card? Doesn't use enough wattage to really be all that concerned about.  Add up the wattage needed, then add 10 percent more.    If you're going to run a powerful graphics card, or more than one, in an SLI or Crossfire configuration, add this needed extra wattage.  There are TWO power usage concerns, you need to take into consideration.    ONE, is the needed wattage. The website that sells the graphics card, OR the graphics card manufacturers website, will state the Minimum wattage requirement. Bear in mind, that the key word here is   Minimum! This is just the MINIMUM needed wattage. However, most people buy a power supply that puts out WAY more than they need!  (Tip: A computer will only use the wattage it needs, and no more.  You could have a million watt power supply, but if the computer only needs 100 watts, it ONLY uses 100 watts!)    TWO, is the needed Amperage for the 12 volt rail. (Usually just stated as an ->A     Should the power supply have more than one 12 volt rail, you can add up all the 12+ volt rails, to arrive at the full 12 volt Amp's.    Does it matter Who makes the power supply? NO.  Does it matter who makes the ram memory? NO.  Does it matter who makes the graphics card? NO.    HOWEVER! It is ALWAYS best to pick out a hardware component, and peruse the 'net to see what the reviews are.  This is called research. The more informed you are, the better you will make intelligent choices.    You won't be one of the many mindless minions, who simply see that if the hardware component costs more, or is faster, shinier, and able to leap over tall buildings, (Okay! My Bad! I just threw those last two in!), then it truly must be the best available!|`|WtwpzZXiaa	brand isnt the issue here as long as the motherboard can accept what your going to put on it     limited to these factors    Video - AGP , PCIe , PCI  RAM DDR, DDR2, DDR3  Socket 775, AM2/2+,   PSU 20+4, 20   HD - SATA or IDE some new motherboards only have 1 IDE port  CD - SATA or IDE|`|YVE64dJUaa	CPU type and socket need to be compatible  RAM type needs to be compatible e.g. DDR, DDR2 etc...  RAM amount needs to be compatible; as if you put more RAM in a socket than it is designed for it won't work  Graphics cards need to be fitted to a compatible socket e.g. AGP or PCI Express etc..  Power supply needs to be sufficient for the computer but they are a standard fit (except for sizes ATX or Micro ATX etc..)      hope this helps|`|mFUWjeGpaa	Power supply brand does not matter in any circumstance that I know of.  RAM needs to be the right type (My RAM is DDR2 for instance, and any other kind will simply not work). You're right about the processor and motherboard, and I would also look up a graphics card that is optimal for your PC before purchasing.|`|99ab666d64d9efa53079a431c3c15bd0aa	Today in x86 architectures (PCs) the brand NEVER matters in theory (see QUALITY note below). That said, the specs ALWaYS matter. For instance, memory comes in 5 or 6 types, and you need to use the right type. Just like a car, each car has a specific TIRE, and it must match the rims, but the BRAND is a matter of preference or choice. If your motherboard takes DDR2 type, you must get DDR2 type sticks from your favorite manufacturer.    Additionally, components like Memory and Power Supply should be considered CRITICAL QUALITY components and you should avoid no-name variants. Try to get name-brand parts on sale or with rebates. Today you can find 4GB of name brand memory for $25 or so after rebates. And you'll find a nice 500W energy efficient name brand power supply with  Active Power Control for perhaps $50 after rebates.

The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'.

It's the 30% who never update Windows that needs to worry.|`|td6WXhv4aa	A misguided attacker did.
FBQZ06vraa	Try avoiding the cliche at the end.    Hope that helps.

zorYTX59aa	I'm beginning to see many questions like yours   on Yahoo!, so I did a ton of googling, searching  and reading -- going through all kinds variations,  combinations, permutations and search results  for:  -- "youtube", "password"  -- "username", "user name"  -- "log", "login", "log-in"  -- "sign", "signin", "sign-in"  -- "doesn't let me", "does not let me"  -- "won't let me", "will not let me"  -- "can't log", "cannot log"  -- "doesn't log", "does not log"  -- "won't log", "will not log"  as well as using the word "sign" instead of "log".    After all of that time, the best that I could come  up with for you are these possibilities:     1) There could be something going on with your  security software or "Firewall". Perhaps it is not   permitting you to send out any of your personal   info -- or if you're a rather young person, maybe    your parents have put a "block" on it.    2) If you're using Firefox, your problem could be  related to "cookies" or "exceptions". If "cookies"  are accepted, YouTube might be an "exception".  Therefore, you should either "allow" YouTube to  store "cookies" or simply remove YouTube from   the "exceptions" list. You can access all of this   by clicking Tools > Options > Privacy.    3) I don't know why, but one person on a forum  discussion thread said he did "CTRL" with "F5",   and for some reason it worked for him.    4) There's a grainy YouTube video of an old lady   with a rather clever idea: delete your passwords.  Things can sometimes get "hairy" if a computer  has many IDs and passwords. For example, I'm  'inukjuak89' on YouTube, 'inukjuak90' on Yahoo,  and other names on different sites. Also, all my   passwords are different as well.    Thus, one thing you may want to do is to check  all your passwords. Believe it or not, she states  you can actually see every one inside of Firefox.   (I don't know because I'm a true devotee of IE6.)   Here are her instructions, plus the YouTube link:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0F90GAd1...    5) The only other thing I can think of is "cookies".  Perhaps a bad/false "cookie" has installed itself  on your comp, and is sending out either false or  wrong information. Even if you don't think that is  the case, delete your "cache" of all its "cookies".   While you are at it, do the same with all of your   "temporary internet files" and your "history" -- in   order to reset everything. Whatever problem you  may be having, this is something you should be  doing at least every couple weeks:    Internet Explorer 6:   Tools  Internet Options    Delete Cookies  OK   Delete Files  OK   Clear History  Yes    OK    Internet Explorer 7:   Tools  Internet Options  Delete...   Delete files  Yes   Delete cookies  OK   Delete history  OK   Close (browsing history window)   OK    Mozilla Firefox   Tools  Clear Private Data  [x] Browsing History  [x] Download History  [x] Saved Form and Search History  [x] Cache  [x] Cookies   Clear Private Data Now    If any of these quasi-solutions does the trick for   you, please click on my avatar and let me know   so that I may incorporate them in any future YA  questions similar to yours.    Here are the links to two websites you may find  interesting if you use Firefox:  http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cook...  http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies|`|i69eA9pEaa	Well, there could be many problems.                                number one: cookies are not in your browser                 to change this, choose "tools" while in an internet window. Then, click "internet options". go to the "content" tab and click "enable". choose the settings you want.                     number two: contact the admin/guy that runs the site. Tell him about the problem.    hope I helped! :)

All you need to do is boot your computer from the disc drive while the OS cd is in the drive. Then you could delete the partition you are using and then create a new partition. This would make you computer like new again.
