20090220041755AA3xMpH	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is there a way to test if your old landlord will give you a bad referral?	I am currently renting from a 2nd place with my best friend.  We had a condo before, which we left in fairly good shape.  The landlord just got mad, because we failed to give 30 days notice of non-renewal (we gave them 25 days notice.  Simple first time renters mistake).  They brought potential renters for a viewing without notifying us (we both work 2 jobs, and only have time during the weekend to clean).  There was some clothes, and trash.  Nothing serious.  Is there a way I can test them to see if they give a bad referral?  (such as calling, and pretending to be landlords trying to rent to myself)?  If this is possible, what questions should be asked that landlords usually ask other landlords?

We have never claimed benefits before but due to my husband being made redundant this week we have no other option but to claim whilst he looks for another job.   I have been on the tax credits and job seekers site and filled in the details of our circumstances but the figures i am getting seem very high, i done it quite a few times to check and it keeps saying the same every time.      Does this sound right for 2 adults (married) and 2 children aged 4 and 2 to get...      Rent paid   Most of the council tax paid   Child benefit ￡33 a week   Child Tax ￡97 a week  (for 2 children)   Job seekers ￡94 a week (married allowance)      I can't see it being right, it would mean that we would get ￡224 a week and still not have to pay any rent and hardly any council tax.   Surly families on benefits dont get this much money, i would be a bit pi*sed off if it is right because my husband has always worked every hour god sends and we have never had ￡234 a week left after paying our rent and council tax.

20090220034806AANmCws	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Ny  State says tax refunds will not be delayed?	ALBANY — Tax officials in New York insist the state will not join the ranks of other fiscally distressed states in delaying income tax refunds this winter and spring.       “Absolutely no talk of that,” Thomas Bergin, a state tax department spokesman, said of suspending or delaying income tax refunds to help prevent any cash flow problems for the state budget.       But some tax preparers say they are starting to see refunds move more slowly in New York.       The state has issued $235 million in refunds during the first four weeks of tax processing as of last Friday, down just slightly from $236 million a year ago during the initial four-week processing period then, according to Susan Burns, a tax department spokeswoman.       But the number of refund checks issued has dropped from nearly 286,000 during the first three weeks last year to       231,000 so far this year. That means the average refund has jumped from $825 last year to $1,015 so far this year. Tax officials could not explain the increase in the average refund but cautioned that the numbers are early in the processing period and could change as the tax season goes on.       New York is facing a potential $14 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year and is just one of more than three dozen states with red-ink budgets. So far, three states — California, Arizona and Kansas — are delaying processing tax refunds as a way to manage cash flow problems.       But experts say there could be slowdowns in some states that the public would not really know about.       “It’s not something that’s popular to announce, so oftentimes you won’t get that. It just sort of happens,” said Jim Eads, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, a Washington group that represents state tax officials.       “It may happen not so much as a total withholding of refunds, but a slowdown in the processing of refunds to more narrowly match cash flow,” he added.       But state officials in Albany say the 2008 budget included $1.75 billion to cover tax refund payments in the first quarter of this year. Come April 1, however, a new fiscal year starts, and if there are delays or postponement of refunds — depending on the outcome of state budget talks — it could be felt after then. But officials cautioned there has been no discussion about any refund slowdowns.       New York customers of H&R Block are told it will typically take eight to 15 days to get a state refund if they file the fastest way: electronically and with a direct deposit of the refund to their bank account.       “It is taking longer than that. At this point, we’re trying to figure out why,” said Gene King, an H&R Block spokesman.       Edward Arcara, a Buffalo certified public accountant, said the tax season has been slowed a bit this year by delays in brokerage houses sending 2008 financial statements to investors. He said it is too soon to determine a trend in refund turnarounds, but he noted that getting refunds from New York always takes a bit longer than from the federal government.       If anything, so far, he said, it is taking a bit longer to get confirmations from the state Tax Department when his clients submit tax forms electronically.       tprecious@buffnews.com          http://www.buffalonews.com/nationalworld...

20090220023653AAxOAIz	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	DO i reject job offer i verbally accepted ?	I verbally said yes to a job offer over the phone the other day but since then an agency called about a job which is only temp but could be made permanent. The job i said yes to isnt the job i was seacrhing for but i said yes to it as i found i wasnt getting anywhere and i thought maybe that the job i was looking didnt exist or i didnt have the right qualifications. The job the agency called about is more or less what i was after (well from reading the job desc), would it be rude to reject the job offer i accepted over the phone. I do have a part time job so if the agency job didnt go to permanent id have something to fall back on so i wouldnt be without a job as such.

20090220034701AARqXO9	Business & Finance;Credit	My mother ran up bills in my name? (long)?	I'm 23 years old.  I have a little sister, 12 years old, who lives with my mother still.   I lived with my mother until I was 20.  Not because I was lazy, but because I dropped out of school at 15 years old due to depression and anxiety.   My family (the three of us) moved a lot.  At a couple of points, both before and after I was 18, my mother used my name (with my knowing) for things like a cell phone bill, cable bill, etc.  It was the only way to have these things, she told me, and she's keep it paid.  She didn't.   At one point, I remember her talking me into opening one of those bank credit cards, running it up (since she'd use it until I had a job, she said), and then not paying it off.   I didn't realize then that the trouble her not paying that stuff would cause me.   Now I'm 23, in college, and with a wonderful guy.  We were looking into getting a home loan (his score is wrecked from divorce) since now is a good time for buying a home, and checked my credit score.  It's in the mid-500s, really bad.   My mother is very volatile, and it's quite hard for me to keep a decent relationship with her.  I try to, though, because I'm trying to watch out for my little sister, and she would keep her from seeing me if she's mad enough.   Also, my mother doesn't make much, and is in plenty of debt herself.   I really don't know what to do... I've thought of bringing it up to her, but I know she would pin it on me, saying it's my fault since I used the stuff, too, and said ok.  I may have been physically an adult, but I wasn't mentally one, since I'd never done anything but stayed at home and take care of my sis!   Thoughts?

20090220024925AAnxd6a	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What do you do when a good job goes bad?	I have been working for the same place for nearly twenty years. While the job isn't really great, I have been able to have good insurance, and I have accumulated over 250 sick days.      But we have a new "assistant supervisor" (a job I applied for and was turned down), and the tone of the workplace has become pretty bad. We had a very aggressive meeting yesterday, obviously meant to put us workers in our place. Conflicts are popping up among workers. And we're facing some budget cuts.      So, this job is becoming a bad job. What do sensible people do in this situation? I know I'm lucky to be employed, and I'm hesitant to give up a job with that much sick leave. (Especially with my new-born twins)      But the job is becoming degrading and humiliating. And it is now officially a dead-end job.

20090220063602AA9J4Cv	Business & Finance;Investing	Can anyone answer this question related to Investment ?	Buying financial products is classed as 'saving', as opposed to investment. The distinction is (in theory) clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; but, if you buy a bond or a share of stock, this transfer payment is excluded from the GDP sum. That is because the stocks and bonds affect the financial capital which in turn affects the production and sales which in turn affects the investments. So stocks and bonds indirectly affect the GDP.          Then why do people consider SENSEX as a barometer of gauging the performance of the Indian Economy ?

20090220060545AA7lRSH	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	How do you handle people that take advantage of you?	I work for an assisted living center as a companion to one elderly woman.  I do not get paid by the assisted living center.  I get paid by the  elderly woman's family.  This is an upscale assisted living center and it costs around $2,500 to $3,500 per month to live there.  Included in the cost of the monthly rent to live there is meals, a room to live in, housekeeping, and someone to take you to Dr. appointments in a limousine, etc.  Well, the question I have is this:  Some of the workers have been taking advantage of me.  Well, I have let them to some extent, but now I am tired of it.  I only come 4 days per week, 3 hours at a time.  Whenever "Donna" has an appointment, and they see me.  they stop me and ask me to take her to her appointment that same day and yesterday, they even asked me to go get her medications for her.  This is not my job and the assisted living center is not paying me for her meds or driving her to her appointments.  I have tried to work out a deal with them where they drive me and her to her appointments if they give me notice in advance, and one time one of the girls was snooty to me because I did not make an appointment with her to take her to her next appointment.  How should I handle this? I am at the point of next time they ask me and do not give me any prior knowledge of her appointments or call me ahead of time, telling them No, I will not take her to her appointment or go with her unless I am giving prior knowledge and that is if I can.  I work another job besides this one and I am extremely busy.  Not explaining and not getting mad.  I do not know how to handle this situation.  Any ideas other than mine?

There are, now, 5 people in the house and it takes him about 3 months to do the taxes online and we don't have any claims like tax deductible donations or whatnot. Just basic single income taxes, and it takes him over 3 months.      Well my boyfriend told me last night that he always gets all of his federal money back and about $80 less than what he paid out in State.   Well last return I paid into federal roughly $1,700 and only got back $414 in returns.  And for State I paid between $400-500 and only got back 40 or 60 dollars.      And I heard that when you are under 18, you should get all of your taxes back. But when I worked under 18, I gave probably $1,000 to federal and only got back like $200.      So what is my dad doing wrong that my boyfriend gets all his money back and my dad gets me only 20% back?!

Ive noticed that over the past few months my boss has been really distant. Today we had a meeting and i mentioned that i hadnt received much feedback lately so i wasnt sure how i was doing. He said, that he had a list of things to put together and we would go over it on tuesday. He said he does feel like there are things we could be doing better. I basically said, so things arent going well? He said, let's just talk about it in a more organized fashion on tuesday. I am annoyed that he waited to say something until i asked. I got promoted this past summer and i feel like i havent lived up to his expectations. I"m worried about losing my job in this economy. What should i expect to hear?

I am supposed to refinance on Sunday from a fha at 6.5% rate to a 5.5. my payment is approx 1670 with interest and all and will be down to 1535 with the refinance. He stated that my escrow will be sent and I can keep it (1200) and i can skip my march payment which will basically give me 300 in the pocket. I didnt really want money back i just wanted my payments lowered by 250 or so to adjust for my other issues that occured.  Is 5.5 30 fixed a good rate or will there be something with this stimulus that will drop housing to 4.5 or so.  He also said I can refinance again after about 6months if the rates got lower,  AM I BEING DOOPED? just so they can get a sale or does it pass the smell test. THanks.O my new mortgage is noe 228,000 it was 225,000. He did say that i could pay points but it would cost me the $3000 they giving me to just drop it .5% which is only about $60 bucks he says

20090220070718AAjDBbL	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is there any way I can repay my HELOC after selling my home?	My husband and I are nearly upside down on our motgage. Foreclosures in the surrounding area have significantly reduced our home's value and we have a 70K HELOC in place. We want to use the HELOC funds as a downpayment to move to a better area (new construction), and would sell our current house for what we owe, gaining no profit. Once we moved out, we would repay the the 70K balance of the HELOC over a 10-18 month period before taking posession of our new home.       Is there any circumstance under which this plan would work? Is is possible that our HELOC lender would agree to allow us to pay back the 70K (although we no longer own the house) over a 10 -18 month period?       And, finally, would this have any effect on our credit if we never missed a payment and intend to keep paying, just not living in the house anymore?       Sorry for the multipart question, but we REALLY APPRECIATE any advice on how we could make this work or if it's impossible.       THANK YOU!       Desperate in Maryland

I have the bulk of our rainy day fund in an on-line account with ING Direct, which is currently paying 1.85% on a regular passbook savings account.       HSBC, which is also an on line only bank is paying 2.25%. I read through the info on line and there's no disclaimer saying it's an introductory rate...that is the rate they are paying.       I've been with ING for about 8 years, but with the economy the way it is, every little bit helps. Assuming that HSBC compounds their interest the same way ING does, it would work out to almost $60 a year. That's roughly a weeks worth of gas or nice dinner out with my husband...but it is worth changing banks over?      Opinions?

20090220063449AAPeKXx	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	I have a question about Taxes. What would make this mistake occur, and what is going on here? What do i do!?	I had a friend file for me. He said I would have to pay 800, so I told him not to file. I worked two places. I am currently 19 the first job was the beginning of the year. I was made about 1500 and was taxed 200, these are guessing figures I can find my paperwork. My second job I made 10,000 and was taxed only 400, whats the deal with that? I also had a large medical bill if that can change anything. I have student loans and the tax statement said I was billed    6,000 in tuition and 2,000 for grants. I think he may have added this to my wages/salaries. The sheet he gave me said total of 20,000 income. With the provided information can anyone tell me how much I should get back? Thats saying the second job didn't make a mistake. I know I filed 1 if not 0 on my taxes, I never file higher than that.

I am a mature student (24) and am studying Accounting.  I am thinking of applying to become a magistrate and am wondering if it will be impressive to have on my CV for when I am applying to accounting firms when I graduate.   Thats not the only reason why I want to do it (although I would be lying if I said it wasn't an influencing factor).   I think it would be interesting, and I would very much like to have a say in what happens to offenders in my community.        But this question isn't about my motivation for doing it, it is about my future prospects in a very competitive industry and wether or not being a magistrate would be a good thing to have on my CV.      I would especially like to hear thoughts on this question from employers.      Thanks      Chrissie.

20090220055026AAEvt0U	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Single parents,how are you making it work for you?	was married and my husband and I both worked full time. Then the marriage broke down and we seperated.    My husband moved to another city and refuses to pay child maintenance or see the children (the CSA tried but he simply quit his job so he doesn't have to pay)   This meant that I had to give up a full time job that I loved so that I could take care of my children. It was an absolutely heartbreaking and painful thing that I had to do (I really did love my job,not many people can say that i know!) but I had no choice,I even tried going part-time to start with so that I could stay but,even with benefits topping up my income,i still couldn't afford to pay the bills. I have no loans or credit card debts,all I had to pay for we're the normal household bills and I still couldn't manage.   I dont have a lavish existence either,we live in affordable rented accomodation and enjoy lifes simple pleasures.   I was shocked that it was so hard to cope.   As soon as my kids we're both in school full time (about 8 months later) I went to the job centre for a "work focused interview" hoping to look for part time work because i wasn't coping well staying at home,dont get me wrong,I love my children dearly and I love being a mother but I also need to work,I need that something in my life that lets me be me.    The lady talked me through all the help available to me and extra benefits they could give me and it all sounded very impressive but after looking at my income (based on me working 16 hours per week) and expenses she concluded that actually i would be "much better off" claiming full benefits and staying at home. Can you believe that!! some "work focused interview" that turned out to be!!!   She said my situation was complicated,there we're too many "hurdles" at the moment (well,my kids are gunna be kids for another 11 years so those "hurdles" will be too)

20090220013143AAqU0Na	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Should I write a book on "How to Double Your Income"?	I've been fortunate and have been able to secure senior positions at large companies, even win jobs and deals against folks much more experienced than I am and in the proces have consistently doubled my income almost every 4 years for many years now.        During my journey, I was happy to help my friends to interview, secure jobs and help put my 2 cents when negotiating a deal for themselves or for their company.      Over the years, my friends have asked me to write a book about how to climb the corporate ladder.  And once again, this topic has resurfaced.      Due to the time committments needed to do such a project, I am reluctant to write such a book unless I was sure people could immensely benefit from it...and also be willing to pay for the book or service (in my opinion, the first step to determining the true value of a book or service).       Thus, my questions are as follows :   1. Why would anyone buy such a book if there are so many self-help books ?      2. Would anyone care about a book with examples of somone not famous?   .   3. How much would you pay for such a book ? ($0 is an acceptable answer)      4. Should I write this book, even though there will likely be no economic benefit to myself and why?

20090220071457AAOA4kx	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I have watched my TSP (gov't 401K) plummett 40K!!!  I have 10 yrs to retire...?	It went from 125K to 85K (I invest in the L fund which is suposed to be the fund that does the "thinking" for you and moves your $$ to the safest spots based on the market at the time).        Does anyone have some encouraging words for me?  I feel sick!! Depressed and worried!  I keep putting $900 a month into it and don't see the sense in continuing to do that.  What should i do, if anything?  Again, i have 10 yrs and I'd like to retire.. I don't want to work longer than that. :(      I make $98,600 currently and have just 20K in personal savings....should I put less into TSP and more into savings?  Thanks.

20090220071040AAOKH09	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Getting my name off a retail lease?	I had signed a business lease until 2014 with a business partner.  I no longer am in that business and have left very quickly along with another employee.  I know I signed the contract with a clause stating i could get out of the lease if any thing happened to my business partner and I.  I contacted the landlord and he  was very short with me and said " he is waiting to have my old business partner sign off my name"... I will be waiting forever! I don't want this to get legal or messy, what are my rights?  Can I walk in the business and request action? Will I get arrested ? Do I send the old business partner a letter of intent?  Is there a legal form I can obtain to do this on my own? Any words of advice will help me greatly, Thank you.

We found out we will owe about $2300 and of course we can't afford to pay that by April 15th.    We know that with being in an installment agreement we will default our installment agreement. My question is.. Should I alert the IRS now to adjust what we are currently paying on our balance to increase it or wait until they send us the letter letting us know we have defaulted and proceed then?

20090220072142AAy5aCP	Business & Finance;Insurance	Am I required to pay the difference between what the doctor's office fee is and what the insurance paid?	I pay for my stepson's medical insurance. My husband's ex and I - my husband and his ex-wife do not get insurance through their work - then split the bills 73 (me)/27(her) percent of what the insurance doesn't cover.      For the 2008 bills, I noticed the the ex is paying doctor bills before the insurance is applied. For example, one bill was originally $114.      But when my insurance is applied, the doctor’s office and my insurance agree on a lower number than what the ex originally paid, since they are in-network providers.       For the $114 bill, the doctor’s office agreed to accept $68.01 as the full payment amount from the insurance.      The ex then gets a check from the insurance company, which only adds up to the lower amount the doctor and the insurance agreed upon ($68.01), not the full bill that she paid ($114).      Almost all of the bills that are fully covered by the insurance have the ex paying more to the doctor’s office than the amount the doctor’s office agreed to take from the insurance.      Am I responsible for 73 percent of cost difference between what the ex paid the doctor and what the doctor agreed to take from the insurance in my percentage amounts?      Is the doctor’s office required to give the ex a credit since they agreed to a lower amount as payment from the insurance company?      Or am I not responsible for the difference because she chose to pay up front?      I know this looks complicated. Thanks for your help.
