20090304123017AAkSPqI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So confused: Is he just being nice; does he want to be good friends OR does he like me?	There is the guy who is my best friends good friend. We all go to guitar class together so we have starting to hang. The thing is, he's giving me these signals which I don't know how to react to, this is what I'm talkin about:   The other day we were chatting online and he told me he wanted to prank call somebody with me on conference, it wa like 1 AM, so I clearly said no. He then called me up and started pleading about it, I said no again and was clear about it, so the topic gradually changed and we spoke for a good half an hour. I kind off felt the 'prank calling' thingum was just an excuse to call me. Also at times when we spoke I could sense him blushing, but then I thought to myself my head was gettin the best of me. So that night his dad came in his room 2 times, I even told him I could talk to him later but he refused. His sister was in the room studying, he asked her to leave the room and study elsewhere, she said no, so he went to the kitchen to talk to me! It made me just feel, like why? Then his dad found him in the kitchen so he hung up, and messaged me later explaining, I texted back saying it was alright, and then he sent me 2 more messages, which I didn't reply to, so he goes "Okay meanie I know you don't like texting but once in a while you should"   Then the other day we met by coincidence, so I smiled at him. He's told me before that I have a great smile but that night online he's like "Don't get me wrong, but i'm hooked on to your smile" he mentioned not to take him in a wrong way, but uh, it DID kinda make me think and feel awkward.    The other day I was angry about something so as we chatted he's like "why so short tempered? Smile gorgeous!" and before leaving he was like "And yeah, don't get angry so easily, and keep smiling because you're worth it"   And last but not least, he left yesterday to go out of town, so he messages me "You didn't even say bye to me meanie, anyways miss me huh, lol take care"      Now, I don't know if I'm exaggerating or what. I don't understand him, I can't figure out whether he just wants to be good friends, or he actually does like me. From my side, I do like him to an extent, plus he's a great person.      Your opinions would be greatly appreciated! :)

I love being apart of it and we are one of the best in our area, they are almost like my family as i grew up in foster care. Im also a hairstylist and am in a relationship with my partner or the past 4 years and i am crazy about him, he is my world. He always lets me know how he feels about me & will go out of his way to make me forgive him if we have a stupid fight, we also live together. He is a tattoo artist and has all the wild out there friends with the crazy hair etc lol. I love them also as they are really nice people but there is one of his friends friend that has a thing for my boyfriend as i over heard her saying so. I never told him but i now hate when she is around him or talks to him. I know i sound like a ***** saying this but she is not even pretty & is very shy with a horrible personality. It gets under my skin when we are all out and she laughs at his jokes or is just around him. When he lifts me or just hugs & kisses me you can see the envy in her. I love this man with everything ive got but i cant stand the thought of her maybe trying to get him! Please help me, what would you do?
20090304104238AAUEfMG	Family & Relationships;Family	Moms, would this be worth it to you?	My sister in law who is pregnant with her 1st baby is literally dirt poor. Her husband and her bring home a combined $350 per week and we live in a VERY expensive area.       Anywho, she is 7 months pregnant and has NOTHING for the baby. She wants my crib, my carseat, my stroller, my changing table and basically everything I owned but I really am planning on having another baby soon so Im just not willing to give it up.      Then just yesterday I found a crib, mattress, and swing chair on craigslist for $40!! Only problem is this is an hour and a half away.      It came with pics and looks pretty good. "Gently used" Ironically its all the same exact stuff my baby daughter has.       My husband doesnt think a 1.5 hr drive is worth it but I do! All that stuff for $40 is a great deal I think. Plus, then I wont look like the bad guy when I say NO to giving up all my baby furniture.

But lately, he's been acting very strange. When i talk to him, he just smiles and blushes then gets on with his work. He doesn't talk to me anymore! Why? And then, when i was walking down the corridors he was with his mates and when i walked past, they started laughing, and teasing him or something. What do you think is up with him? Why has he stopped talking to me???   We used to be such good kind-of mates. But ever since we started year 9, he's changed...

20090304104127AABpqkB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this boy, but...?	I know that he likes me, because hes really flirty, and i asked him the other night and he said yes.   I've been out with him in his car a couple of times, and hung out with him at college at dinner. But the other day i think i over did it and made myself seem too 'available'. He seemed quite distant when i was talking to him online.      So i havent really spoken to him in the last 2 days much, though he tried to get my attention at dinner today.      How do i make it so that i dont seem too needy, but at the same time dont push him away by ignoring him?

So me and my friends Paige, Kevin, and John were 4 way talking on the phone. xP Me and Paige were talking about her ex Eric.Eric said he likes me and she's encouraging me to go out with him. Paige is going out with John who is Eric's friend.       Paige had said I liked Eric and then Kevin heard it! I'm not sure if Kevin likes me but he won't tell me. He heard it and got mad and hung up the phone. Paige was just playing around because she has seen me and Eric flirting around and stuff. Kevin thought Paige was telling the truth.      Now Kevin won't talk to me. He said I "broke his heart". But the thing is I only like him as friends and that's it. When people ask if we were going out he would accept us as only friends.

20090304102929AAXjBeW	Family & Relationships;Friends	How is this letter for my aunt?	can anyone proof read it and help me organize it    if i have specific words and language that is formal also correct capitalization, and so on. thanks if u can help me! what else can i add to let her know she is my hero??             Dear Aunt ----,    I want you to know that you are my hero and I look up to you so much. Thanks for giving me the confidence in life. To me you’re my hero because you are someone who endures hardships you probably wouldn’t have to endure. When you used to live with us, it surprised me how you still were in a good mood and smiling the whole day even though you went to sleep late and got up early. I never say you being crabby or grouchy.     Of course you may not save kids from burning buildings or anything like that, but to me you do just as good. You are a great role model and an excellent house keeper. Going to your house was always the best. You even bought me presents sometimes, even though it wasn’t my birthday. Because you have so many little ones, you don’t get a lot of you time. You sacrifice a lot of your time on your kids, nieces, and nephews. You are everyone’s favorite aunt.     I would like to be like you if I ever get to be an aunt, because you’re a fun and outgoing person. Also, you are kind, inspiring and my hero. You’re the most positive person in my life. You’re always so bubbly, outgoing, funny, and interesting.

20090304110210AAc2VGH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What kind of guy would be interested in me?	I've always had trouble knowing what kind of guy would actually take me seriously. Because where I live, nobody has morals, and I'm just waiting for that perfect guy to show up. So I'm going to put up some of my interests and characteristics, and tell me what kind of guy would be interested?...      I'm a christian, I don't go to church every sunday, but I pray to God every night and I read the Bible whenever I'm feeling down.   I believe in sex coming after marriage (waiting for my purity ring to come in the mail!)   I love to laugh and joke, and I love giving guys hugs, it just makes me feel good inside. :]   I try not to gossip, I love will ferrel movies, tim burton movies, and some chick flicks. I love reading. Mostly middle earth, fantasy, or love stories. I'm in an acoustic band with my best friend, I'm learning piano, I love antique stores, and I dress very simple with a slight vintage look. I take care of myself. I love drawing, mostly with charcols. Oh and I love writing, I want to become a book writer some day.   I like guys who share the same beliefs as I do, guys who are gentlemen, etc. I try not to text or call guys too much. I try to understand when they're too busy, I try not to argue, I try to support their decisions, I'm not clingy, I don't like holding hands TOO much and I don't think it's nesseccary to be in contact with eachother 24/7.   I have brown hard, and I don't wear alot of makeup. I'm petite, but not to the extreme. I get alot of compliments on my eyes, alot of people say I'm very pretty (I'm not conceited, I'm  just trying to describe myself more) I love animals, I'm very shy at first, but after awhile, I can be a little immature and flirty. I'm 15, by the way, and turning 16 in in may.      So tell me, do you think guys would be interested in someone like me? :/ Or who would be my type, do you think?

20090304104703AA1xNXU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this an abusive relationship?	My mom became involved with a man about one year ago. They supposedly hit it off but after one week, she was already moving in. She became very depressed and overly cranky all the time, and completely lost her personality and what she liked to do. She immediately adapted to his life doing all of his daily routines but forgetting about herself in the meantime.       Apparently he brings back all these bad memories from her childhood and she thinks it's a good thing and that he's really helping her... but after he gets her all upset he tells her to take anxiety pill after pill after pill.  He also has a 35 year old son living at home that literally has the social skills of a 12 year old. He doesn't clean up after himself, he washes himself with scrubbing bubbles. He calls his dad 6-7 times a day just to tell him about his day. This really drives my mom crazy because she has 3 kids, but she raised all of her kids. All of her kids (including me) are grown up, living on our own, and married.      Whenever she gets upset about something dealing with his son, she treats her like she's insane and says, "Your feelings are imagined, what are you really upset about? Is it (insert one of her kids names.)"      I told her that if she had higher self-esteem she could get out and see what a true man should treat her like. she's a brave and beautiful woman and it really kills me to see her constantly treated like a crazy person.      This man is on disability for bi-polar. He has nothing to offer her - not even love and support. He goes into these crazy spells and calls the police on her for leaving because he believes she's going to kill herself, when she doesn't even make statements like this. I have grown up in a loving family until my dad died, and I know this is not how a man should treat his wife or girlfriend.      Please help me, I am desperate to show her that there IS a better life out there for her, even if it means being alone. Is she being mentally abused? It certainly seems that way to me. I apologize for the length, I'm still leaving about tons of insane details.
20090304104724AA1CDb5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which Is More Important In A Relationship..Trust Or Sex?	I am having a problem with my boyfriend right now...My issue is trust in him and his issue is that he wants more sex...   (we have sex at least 4 times a week..i thought that would be good for most men)      He hasn't cheated but he does things that i don't like, things that he knows he wouldn't like done to him....he receives phone calls all thru the night, he gets txt msgs from his ex's all the time..one incident is that in a txt msg he asks her to call him, so she does....i understand keeping in contact with ex's just to check up on them but i don't understand why he explains to how terrible she was and that she was the worst girlfriend he ever had but then tells her to call him for her new number.    (mind you he's the one initiating all of this!!)      Lately, because of all of this, I haven't been giving him sex...and i think it's a result from my trust issues with him..we have discussed these problems before ...he believes sex is more important.

Okay, Ive been best-friends with my best friend for 11 years. we've always been there for each other, until 4 years ago when we moved to different secondary schools. we used to ring each other every week, and text each other every day, then a year ago she became friends with a boy down her road, and fell in love with his best friend. before she met him she was sociable, and kept up to date with her best friends, but now he's always over hers from 6 - 10, or she's at his. her mums a teacher at her school, so they leave at 5. then, at the weekends she's at his. i try to ring her and she either tells me to go away or talks to him whilst on the phone to me (ignoring me). she's never online, and is ditching me. its hard enough that we don't go to the same school..what should i do?
20090304103319AAIldYC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my behaviour morally wrong?	For the last eight days, I have allowed a tramp to live in the mansion so long as he entertains me.  I have had him (try) to swallow swords, eat fire and walk through hot coals. I even put him on stilts dressed up as a chicken drumstick while attempting to walk up the stairs.   He is now very unwell with various injuries but, nonetheless, I have found this vagrants amusing stunts very entertaining. But I have wondered whether the singular enjoyment of this desperate man's suffering is morally wrong, given that he is only doing what I tell him because he wants a night of shelter. I would appreciate advice from you common people.
20090304103649AAmNOlX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is withholding sex from your husband/wife abuse?	I recently asked a question about lack of sex being the reason for a divorce, and while reading through the answers I found several people responded by saying that divorce should only be granted for only very few reasons, one of them being ABUSE.      So I'm curious, isnt withholding sex from your partner not a form of abuse?
20090304104722AAmYvdJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should I keep my girlfriend on ice?	My girlfriend has treated me very poorly as of late. Saturday she did something really mean that I'm still angry about. I don't want to break up with her, but I'm not a doormat either. I haven't contacted her since Saturday. Yesterday she texted me and I replied with single-answer responses until she got the hint and left me alone. How long should I keep this up? Should I wait until she calls me? I want her to get the message and perk her interest level, but I don't want to go back to her too quickly and make her think she can get away with this stuff in the future. How long should I hold out until I confront her about everything?
20090304102547AAWjU5Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok i need some serious advice...?	It's super embarrassing.. but whatever it's killing me inside.. so i met this dude at a club and we hit it off.. 2 days later we hooked up.. yeah big mistake!!               but as i got to know him more we continued to do it.. and he came over like 4 days ago and we did it again and uh.. well he kinda made me BLEED..               and he hasn't talked to me since it has been 3 days! :( i know! i am aware that i shouldn't have put myself out there like that and he probably thinks of me as some piece of *** :( but what are your thoughts on this?? he's super busy with school and work.. but i highly doubt thats it.. i feel as though he is disgusted? but i mean hey it happened.. and he's old enough to be mature about it.. he's 21 so i don't know what to think.          this blows.

20090304103256AAicKoF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in my situation?	I am 22, and have been with my 24 y.o. GF for almost 3 years. Been living together for 2 years.  I do love my GF and we usually get along very well.  Main thing we fight about is that she doesnt like having sex as often as I do.  I had a huge crush on a girl I met before my current GF, I was good friends with this girl but apparently I was 'too nice' too her, as she said she only saw me as a friend when i told her how I felt.  She said she would never like me in that way n just wanted to be friends.  Despite the fact that we got along really well, and I always cheered her up when she was upset.  Anyway, I never really let go of this and it makes me want to go out with other girls for whatever reason.  I would certainly enjoy being in a relationship with another girl, and speaking to other girls, but mostly I think it is the idea of other girls wanting to be my gf that appeals to me.        I know this comes across as shallow and insincere to my gf - but let me clarify that I would never cheat on my gf.  Even so, I have this constant urge to see other people.  My gf and I rent a unit, and both study full time.  I couldnt afford to live by myself atm and I certainly couldnt bring other girls over (if we broke up - that would be a bit weird and me gf would likely kill them).         I cant really see myself breaking up with my gf - but at the same time, I'm about to start uni again and would really like to see other people - while still being faithful to my gf... Frustrating much 8-(      I know soem of you will say to stay with my gf since we're pretty happy, n some will say follow my heart - but its just such a pain being in this situation and not knowing what to do.      I'd be interested to read your  thoughts and any similar experiences
20090304103753AA9HSBI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you get a parenting plan without getting divorced?	Due to the economy I was laid off from my job.  This resulted in my wife moving out of state with our daughter to live with her mom.  We still love each other and want to make things work.  We don't want to get divorced but, I want to make sure if my wife and daughter establish residency in New Mexico I don't loose my chances of seeing my daughter.  So, I was thinking of getting a parenting plan so that we both set up guidelines as far as visitation.  Does anyone know if I can get a parenting plan without getting divorced?

20090304110034AAQOiTP	Family & Relationships;Family	My friend says that I'm "dysfunctional" because of my cynical attitude about my family?	My friend says that I grew up in a dysfunctional home because I'm very cynical about family and don't understand "normal" extended family dynamics. I freely admit that I don't communicate with most of my family because they're scumbags.       Both of my parents came from abusive households; their parents were severe alcoholics who couldn't seem to keep it together. My mom grew up watching my grandmother get drunk out of her mind and start tearing apart their house, throwing things at the kids, etc. My dad is the only child out of six in his family to be born without the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and was subjected to severe abuse and neglect until he left home at age 16. Basically most of my family is pretty messed up so I never had a relationship with most of them. If I saw any of them on the street I'd only admit to being related to an aunt, an uncle and a few cousins.       My parents worked hard to separate themselves from the white trash world they grew up in. We were just a normal blue collar family but at least we had the class not to behave the way the rest of the family did. My friend grew up in a middle class family where everything was all sunshine and roses. Not many of her relatives had any major problems and those that did have problems didn't have them nearly as bad as mine do. She always tells me that I must be exaggerating and that its "a shame" that I don't talk to my family. She also gets mad when I say that kids can grow up fine without grandparents. I never had them and didn't turn out any worse for the wear because I had parents and several non-related adults who really cared about me. I'm 23, married to a software engineer, a homeowner (currently in the process of a big remodel I'm doing myself) and very stable in my life. I've made good decisions, isn't that what counts?      My parents moved 3 states away from their families when I was one so holidays were usually spent with my immediate family and friends we'd made. My dad worked construction and he'd often meet people that were new to the area, if they didn't have anywhere to go on Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc, he'd invite them over to our house. There's several people we met that way that I still to this day call aunt and uncle.       I was raised to believe that family can mean anything from actual biological relatives to very close friends. Love is thicker than blood; just because I share DNA with someone doesn't mean that I NEED to have a relationship with them. What's so dysfunctional about that attitude?

20090304102510AASs8Zh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am a shy girl! How can I act more outgoing without seeming superficial?	I am sorry if i sound horrible but i must say the truth to get the answers I need. I am quite a shy girl when there is a person who i feel inferior to... for example the boy i like or certain girls. I don't know what it is. I clam up and don't know what to say. My body language is very cramped... What type of body language should i have with talking with cool people i dont know? Whats things should i say? I am in the 'cool group' at school but i don't fit in THAT well because i am soo 'in my own world' ... its not realy my scene... I have 3 very close friends... but they get along well because they act completely different when they are with the whole group.      Now the guy! I have made out with him once when clubbing... (problems my bff liked him too and embarrasing akward wow) But i still like him so much. He laughs with other girls... but acts like i dont exist. I am shy and when i walk past him... sometimes i tilt my head away from him. What can i say I AM SHY... but i am... well a very goodlooking girl. What can i do to let him see me in a more attractive light? I have many classes with him and since we are in the same friend grop... we sit on the same table... but us two never talk. What could i say or do to be noticed by him? He jokes alot and is very funny... but can be very immature and sick at times.

20090304103224AAMagSs	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Who should get married first? My sister and I just recently got engaged.?	She is 22 and got engaged on Feb 14th and acted like it was a huge surprise. Then we found out she bought her own ring. She is 7 month pregnant and has only been with the guy for 5 months (they broke up for 2 months) as you can guess my family is not happy about this guy who has only had a job for 2 months. I got engaged on Feb 26th my 28th birthday. My family is thrilled! Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years and my family has always loved him. We announced it and the first thing my sister tells me was the only reason I was asked is because she was. My boyfriend tells me that was not true he wanted to do it at Christmas or Valentines Day but didn't want to be cliche. So he waited until I was very unsuspecting. We have already picked a date and started planning (we have had 3 years to discuss what we want and how) Oct 2010. My sister has not picked a date but keeps saying between May 2010 and August 2010. Everyone keeps telling me that they my not last that long and to keep planning.  I don't want to plan and start paying for everything and then find out that she is getting married that same year and right before mine. I don't want family to have to pick between us or to the them paying for two weddings in the same year. Thank-you!

20090304103259AAZXYPd	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I be pissed at my dad?	This all happened a little bit before x-mas. My dad and mom started acting really wierd around each other ( im 15) and avoiding each other. I though nothin of it until one morning i woke up for school and they were argueing, like full- blown argueing. I had never heard them argue like that before. So i come home from school and my dads like dont be surprised if we get a divorce and my world just crashed. I wasnt even that worried about me , i was worried about my two little sisters who are 9 and 11. This would kill them!! so i kept it to myself but needed to know more. So i asked my mom one day what was going on, she said that they had fallen out of love and he cheated on her. I was shocked because my dads mom is very religious and he was not raised this way so i just couldnt believe. I asked my dad what really happened and he told me he had an affair. I wanted to slap him in the face. So know i am haveing trust issues because i do not trust my dad at all not one bit. But im trying to hide it for my sisters. So do you think i have a real right to be mad even though he didnt neccessarily cheat on me???

20090304103622AAsaHwO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help going through a divorce and she won't let go!?	I'm not sure what to do I'm divorcing and trying to move on with my life. This was a bad marriage emotionally. We have kids together and she is always trying to guilt me into doing things with her and the kids "to show them Mommy and Daddy can still get along". I'm talking about going apple picking, the pumpkin patch, and even swimming there is always an excuse as to why she can't do it on her own. If I don't go then the kids don't get to go after she has already told them they are going before she has even asked if I can go. Then if I can't go because I have to work or have other commitments already its a huge fight about how I don't love my kids. Any help on how to tell her I don't have to be with her every timee she wants to do something with the kids would be greatly appreciated. (Don't get me wrong I love my kids and don't mind go occasionally but not every time and I don't think I should be made to feel bad, told I don't love my kids or that I'm a bad father because I can't or don't want to go. I do stuff with my kids by myself when I have them why can't she?)

20090304103740AAPd5WR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	She Thinks I'm a... "Vampire"?	So, at my school, there's this girl who came up to me the other day and she said "Hey, I know your secret!".   And I'm really confused, but I go ahead and play along, and ask what my 'secret' is.   "You're a vampire!"   "....... what......?"   "Don't play dumb! It's so obvious! You're all pale and quiet and sexy!"      So then she starts naming off all these supposed "vampire characteristics of mine", and then she tries dragging me outside to see if I glittered in sunlight or something. WTF?   I heard her friends talking to her later; they seemed to agree that I was so obviously a vampire that they couldn't believe no one else noticed it. Amid the babble they all spewed out, I caught a familiar name: "Robert Pattinson".      I had remembered that Pattinson was a minor actor in a Harry Potter movie, but thought that he may have done something else linking to these girls' misconceptions. Sure enough, a quick Google search turned up a new teenage vampire movie called "Twilight", and apparently it's really popular. Upon further research, I found Pattinson's character actually WAS a bit like me. But I'm not a vampire!         Oh, what to do. Soon I'm sure that all kinds of little rumors will be spreading through the school about me. I've thought of taking the girl to the side and talking about this to her, but I'm afraid she'll just think I'm trying to hide my so-called "secret".       Any help would be appreciated.

Since we're both very outdoorsy and adventuresome, instead of a luxury vacation, we're going to Peru, and going to spend a week trekking the Inca trail to Macchu Pichu, and then spend a week in a jungle lodge deep in the Amazon jungle.      What are little touches I can do to make this seem more romantic? I LOVE the vacation that we're doing, but how can I make it more of a honeymoon? Like, what can I do/bring/add to make this more memorable and special?      The Inca Trail trek is 4 days. We're going to be camping along the trail. The other nights we're going to be in hotels or haciendas.       One hacienda in particular is very nice/romantic, and the jungle lodge is romantic in a 'Romancing the Stone' kinda way...lol. It's DEEP in the jungle - not a lot of luxury, but tons of ambiance. :D
20090304110503AAEzbkV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I threw my wife's wedding ring out the window on the highway?	We were arguing again over some stupid crap and then she suddenly pulls her two carat diamond ring off her finger and throws  it at me saying she doesn't want it and I said fine  and tossed it out the window on the highway doing 70 mph. She screamed and started to cry uncontrollably.  I searched and searched for her ring, but to no vail it could be found. So I had to break down and this time I bought her a 3 carat diamond ring. She told me she doesn't want it. She wants the old wedding ring back.  I can't find the old ring.      Why is my wife being stubborn when she is the one that didn't want the ring to begin with?
20090304112021AAlnSaM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sex too early? lots of advice please?	There's a boy who I've known for at least four years but we haven't hung out all that much and never just me and him. Well I went to over to his place with my friend and we were drinking a little and after she was asleep we had sex. He then said it wasn't a one time thing for him. A few days later he text me and wanted to hang out but I was still getting over an ex and apprehensive. We made plans but they never happened because I don't have a car and he lives an hour away. he asked me through text what I thought of him and why I wanted to see him and I told him I was intrested in getting to know him but that I didn't know what I wanted at the moment. He replied saying that's what he wanted to hear so I don't think I'm just a booty call. We hung out last weekend at my friends house with one of his friends too and I could tell he wanted to fool around but it wasn't a good time of the month for me. We just text last night and I told him I wanted to hang out but we have no set plans yet. having already had sex with him I don't think I'm coming across the way I really want to but at the same time I'm very attracted to him and want it so why should I hold back. I want a way that I can redeem myself in his eyes because I must seem very easy but what he doesn't know is that he is only the second person I've been intimate with and obiously the first that I wasn't in a serious relationship with first. I just don't know what I should do so any advice please.
20090227071128AAongh4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it okay to have "two best mans"?	I am getting married later this year and my fiance has a dilema.  We are having a backyard wedding with about 70 guests...low key and simple but still elegant.  Anyways, he has two friends he wants in his wedding party and wants them both as best men.  Can he have two best mans?  I was planning on just my sister as my bridesmaid but I am will to ask my half sister as well now since he feels he must include both of his close friends.      Any advice?
20090227065706AAsWIvs	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should all of my flower girls' shoes match or can they be different?	I have 3 flower girls in my wedding and we decided to have them wear ballet shoes (white ones made for flower girls, not for actual ballet) since it will be really comfortable for them and easy to walk in. My question is, should they all match, or should I just tell the moms whatever they find is fine? I'm guessing it doesn't matter if they match perfectly or not, but I don't always trust my judgment - thanks!
20090227064641AARg4Wh	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm becoming tired of my Mother Inlaw any advice?	Here is the problem I am having with her.  My husband I just recently married (Nov, 2008) but I have been with him for 10 years prior to that date.       My brother inlaw (his younger brother) married his wife in 2006 after 4 years of dating. His wife I guess is far more ideal in the eyes of my inlaws.  She's pretty, married quickly and had a child right away.            I on the other hand am not that pretty (not like her at least) and can't have children.       There are more differences between us but the problem I have is with my MIL not her.  The majority of the interaction I have from my MIL is when she asks me or my husband to help her with this or that.  With me it's always to come help her with computer issues and with my husband it's with mechanical problems or house hold problems. It's also to help my husband's younger sister out as well with money or car problems etc.       However if it's anything fun my MIL is going to my brother inlaw and his wife. Things such as baking a birthday cake for the same younger sister , going prom shopping for her or they plan a beach vacation together and then ask if we would like to come later.  However since we weren't included the dates of their vacation lands smack, dab in the middle of a prior commitment.      I've become tired of always being asked to help her with computer problems or when my husband's younger sister needs help (like filing out a job application).       Also on the other hand if I ask my MIL for help with something it's like pulling teeth and she ignores me unless I point blank ask her again about it and then she normally has an excuse for why she wont or can't help me out.       I don't think I've done anything in the past for her to at like this. I will tell you in the past my inlaws values have surprised me.  An example of this is my Father inlaw would become more upset if his daughter was gaining weight then when she received a bad grade. He would constantly hound her about her weight and he did the same thing to my husband (his 6' 1" and weighed 180 pounds) and my MIL was giving slimfast to both of my husband's younger sister when she was 14 years old.       They also didn't have a problem with the fact that my sister inlaw (My husband's brother's wife) stripped for extra money and infact my MIL encouraged my husband's younger sister to work at a strip club (but as a waitress).       Any advice for me?  Like I said I'm not jealous of my sister inlaw I just wish I felt like my husband and I were treated equally.

20090304110538AAyzbaU	Family & Relationships;Family	Trouble with Boyfriend's Mother...?	Although I have known her for over two years, I am having a very difficult time dealing with her. It's like nothing i do seems to measure up to her standards. She keeps telling my bf that our relationship will not last and that he is wasting his time. She's a complete psycho.   I try to act normal when she's talking sh!t about me but i can't... I try to ignore her because she's his mom and stuff but still nothing seems to work.. I've told him he asks me to ignore her.. but still she wouldn't leave me alone.   Why can't she get that we actually love each other?   His dad is great and likes me.. but she just hates me.   Clearly, it affects my relationship with my boyfriend in negative ways. I know she is unwell but she is mean too, which makes the situation impossible. I feel discouraged. Any advice would help.
20090304112520AA0rpYw	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's on his mind? did i do the right thing?	this guy and i were dating for a month until he told me he met this other girl he likes more. he asked if we could still be freinds and then made the girl his girlfriend (they have a long distance relationship). i said yeah ok. and after that we always tried to hang but one week i was sick, the next he cancelled on me because he got invited to a bbq. the other he called last minute and said pick you up in five minutes but i couldnt have gotten ready in five minutes. this last week i go out with my own friends. a girl and a guy. he called randomly saying to meet him at this place i said ok so i tell my friend to head there. he then calls and asks if i'm with a bunch of pretty girls for his friends. i said no i'm with a guy friend and my other friend. he changed his mind and said we're going home then, he said he was going to stop by and said hi on his way but he never did. i don't know if i'm over reacting but none of my friends treat me like that. when they say something they stick to their plans. i feel like he wants me as his little side thing which is pretty funny because my feelings for him are gone and i really did think we could be cool. last night on messneger he clicks on me saying "hey sexy". i got pissed 1) because he has a girlfreind and i'm sure she wouldn't appreciate that and 2) buds don't call other buds sexy. so i replied. "lol sexy? boy what the hell is wrong with you?" and he didn't answer so i signed off. what do you think? you think i did the right thing. and what do you think his true intentions are. we never had sex while dating we are both virgins but like i still feel like he's using me in some retarted way. tell me what i should do next.
20090304115133AAD1a6m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies....what is it that you appreciate in men when they....?	...approach you if they are interested in you.  I just want some opinions of what you look for.  Usually I try to come across as calm and confident, but im not super attractive looking so I usually have to try a little harder than most guys.  Girls that I notice who may find me attractive that dont find me physically attractive just act like they're flattered but nothing else.      If an average looking guy were to approach you what would be some things that (from your experience that you noticed from guys in the past that approached you) did.  Appearance and personality wise.      Aside from overall appearance, what are some things you look for in particular.  Hair cut, shoes, smell nice.  Smile, what?      Tell me something that you think most guys dont know.  Not things like being respectful, something detailed.  Thanks
20090227070407AAUjBJn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Hubby says he doesn't love me?	Yet i'm so confused, he comes to see me and the kids everyday (left family home last july, living with brother) takes us out on day trips, shopping , down to his mums and other brothers houses etc. He has also took out a loan to get me a new (not brand new but newish) car which i got monday, he still has all his wages paid into our joint account and wont have it any different. He insits on hugging and kissing me, we did start sleeping together again before xmas and he started saying he loves me again and is coming home but on boxing day he went on one again. Says he doesn't love me, there is no hope for the marriage and i must move on yet his actions still all say different. I feel he is depressed which he strongly denies, his mum and bros have also made comments similar to this, he will not go to the drs.What should i do folks, be patient, fire him off, file for divorce, plz give opinions and make me see things clearer, thnx

What if your ex says he's been looking for you that whole time and finally got in contact with you through many of friends. Would it be wise to walk away from your current relationship to see what happenes? Oh and also this ex is someone you can talk to for hrs on in and feel really good talking to....the chemistry is def there. What would you do?
20090227070200AAVBfbI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Stressful Friendship?	I am in a real pickle and I am not sure what to do........ Sorry for the long story      My friend and I have been friends for about 5 years. During this time we have both given each other support through bad times. My friend has always lacked confidence and sought for me to help her build her confidence. This has never been a problem until recently where I have found that she says she wants to change but when it comes to crunch time she never takes action. Its like she would rather feel bad about herself than take the scary steps in becoming more confident. I have tried to offer the support and help her to become more reflective and figure out what she wants in life, yet everytime she is faced with the opportunity to change it doesn't happen.      The problem is that her lack of confidence and her behaviour is causing me stress and it is having a negative impact on our friendship. What makes it worse for me is that I am pregnant and for the whole 8 months I have been stressed with her.      I feel that we need a break, so that we can assess where we are and also try and gain a more balanced friendship, yet this brings problems with explainig it to my husband.       My husband doesnt know about the stress of the friends and already is questioning why I havent texted her back as quickly. I know that if protect her I am going to flack and he is going think that I am out of order for being distant. Everyone feels sorry for her and I have a feeling that my Husband will side with her.      I know this is my own making as I wanted to protect my friend so I never told my husband our problems, cos had I been upfront at the begining my husband would have pushed me to end it with her the moment she stressted me out.        I want to be friends with my mate, I want it to be balanced yet I need time but that brings its own problems.      Should I tell me husband the truth, or do I try and find an excuse for the break?

20090227070320AA1PsMD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Let Him Go or Keep Trying?	I've known this guy for almost three months now. He told a friend's boyfriend that he likes me but that he's afraid that he's not good enough for me. He confessed (while he was drunk) last week that he wants me to be in his life for a long time and if that means us not sleeping together anymore so that he doesn't mess things up then he won't do it. We got into it yesterday and I told him that he didn't respect me and he kept sending me text messages all day saying that he apologized and that he does respect me that I'm just not in his position. The thing is, he has not outright came and told me that he has feelings for me. In fact, when he's sober, he says the exact opposite like he "doesn't want to hinder me from dating other dudes." and stuff like that. I went out of town last weekend with a few of my friends and when I got back he asked me if I met anyone. I told him no and then he asked me again! I'm about ready to give up. I told my sister that I think I'm going to date other guys but she said she doesn't think that's a good idea. I know he's had past trust issues and been burned in most of his relationships but he is so closed off. I'm not used to that kind of guy. My gut tells me that he likes me, and his actions say it too, but everytime he says something it makes me doubt my insticts. Any advice? Thanks!

20090304114117AA61UB5	Family & Relationships;Friends	This boy in my year wanted to beat up this little kid for a stupid reason so i defended him was i right?	Theres this guy in my year he always gets in fights and seems to always get beat up you'd think after a few beating you'd give up but he seems determined. Today there was this boy 1 year younger that us just sitting calmly when he picked on him. There was a crowd of spectators and he challenged him to a flooring match to see who can get the other to the floor first. The boy who's younger than us didn't want to fight but the boy in my year insisted. After about a minute the boy a year below me had the guy in my year on the floor. After he said can i go now please im tired.       The boy was incensed and went after the boy and said come and take a walk with me we all knew his intentions were to beat the boy up. People were dragging the guy 1 year younger than me to go and fight the boy but he didn't want me. As they were about to fight i stepped in and said this ain't right because just because he floored you, you want to beat him up for no reason he's younger than you just leave him alone. After about a min the teachers emerged and the crowd dispersed!      Do you think i was right to protect the boy?
20090304111609AAwCab2	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad won't let me make my own decisions?	I told him I wanted to trade in the PS2, and he said "Why do you want to trade in your PS2?" I told him I wanted to sell it for money.   "What are you going to do with the money?"   "Save it"   "What about the games?"   "I'll sell them too."   Then he went on a rant, I never listened to a word of it.   The only reason I want to sell the PS2 is because I don't play it much.   And I really need money at the moment.
20090304114213AAeMzkN	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I stop talking about people I don't like?	I have this tendency to talk about people I don't like..not to everyone..just to a few people who I thing are my friends..I do it because I can't control myself and want to get it out..I feel I need to talk about them..I don't want to be a "**** talker"..but I just need to get it out..I hate not being able to express my feelings..and the things I say aren't lies..they are facts..like how I think she is annoying or how I heard she was a slut and she kind of confirmed it by something she said to me once..         What can I do? I think she knows I said something about her because she gave me a look..I'm not scared of her..but I don't like confrontation..it was bad on my part for trying to let something out to someone who was my best friend at one point.
20090304111332AAWxvYJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Who does my mom care for more me or my sister and why if any1.?	Every night i go up to my room work myself into a rage and start yelling out obscene gestures aimed torwards my older sister."She is an alcholic,sex addict and drug addict."She doesnt understand is I have aspergers syndrome and that causes me to do that since I dont agree with her way of life.I usually end up telling her she is not my sis beacause if she was she would be a conservative minded girls just like i am a conservative man.She was raised to always get what she wants and I wasnt but yet ppl think higher of her and the know bout my issues.   I have been seeking help since age 13 but my counselor said that I will only get worse as I get older andshe even told my family that.   So that inspires her to call me names that degrade those with mental issues like psycho.But she dosent understand it is not my fault I was born with it.   she is a grade A ***** in my book.   One of my symptoms is lack of empathy and understanding.   My mom is a ***** for siding with her.   I told her I am 18 and can care for myself but I guess she dont give a **** or even care about what i would think      Funny thing is I launch those gestures at my sister

20090227070819AASfKGf	Family & Relationships;Friends	WHAT IN THE WORLD!!!?	ok so last night i was on myspace. and a status poped up from my best friend Jacky. it said something like "im F***** pissed why would she do that?! i hate that F***** B**** im not going to talk to her for a while." so i sent her a comment saying that was a pretty strong status and is she ok. she never commented me back but her status changed to something like "you should know who you are and you should know what you did you have pushed me too far over the edge."       now i dont know if she was for a fact talking to/about me here but i thought over today and looked for anything i could have done wrong. i came up with nothing. last time i saw Jacky was in the theater 3rd period and we were working on our dance. (we're both on dance team) and she was perfectly okay with me then and even waited with me after the bell to change from my dance shoes.       but i cant help thinking it was me who did something though because she didnt write me back about her status and instead kept changing it. and i know it wasnt that she just didnt feel like writing to anyone because later her status changed again to something like "thanks mac for calming me down"      i dont know if shes mad at me or not and if she is i have no idea what i did. what should i do?
20090227064403AAZIjBJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Dr Phil Interview with Nadya Suleman?	I'd like to hear your thoughts on the Nadya Suleman interview with Dr. Phil.  Did it change your mind about her?   Here are some of my thoughts...   I am trying hard not to judge this woman, to give her the benefit of the doubt, and to try to place myself in her position but I just can't!  I thought maybe if I watched this interview that I would find something in it that made me feel bad for her, but it didn't.    I think the main reason that I am so upset is because of the wrong choices made time after time with this woman.  In these harsh economic times many Americans have had to place their dreams on hold, because we can't afford it.  That could mean a second child, or attending Grad school, as in my case.  We are trying to save all the money we have to brace ourselves for what is to come.  Even though I would love to have a second child, I know that it would be irresponsible of me because I am uncertain what the future will hold.  Nadya didn't look at any of this with her 2nd, to her 14th!  She wanted more children so she went out and had them with out a thought on how she would financially provide for them!     Listen, I get it why Dr. Phil and a handful of others are pleading for help for this woman.  It's to protect those kids, not her!  The thing that has left me torn is what will happen to those kids in the long run.  At first I felt she needed to turn over some if not all of the new babies to the state so they could provide proper care.  Then I really thought of the care SOME kids receive growing up in the system and would this be a better option?  I just don't know.  Then I thought about what if Dr. Phil and others raise enough money to provide proper housing and volunteers for these babies what happens 2 years from now?  When Nadya is still not financially able to provide for these children, and all the volunteers go away?  If we step up and save her now we will be saving her until the last child is 18!  That doesn't seem fair?  There is no way that she will be able to provide for those kids, even if spouse comes into the picture.     I do believe the system of government assistance is acceptable to use, as it was set up.  When you go through hard times, use it, then you get back on your feet and stop.  This woman has been using the assistance from the beginning, and now will have to use it until these children all turn 18.  Is that fair?  I don't think so.  This isn't a problem to where we can help a fellow American until they get everything sorted out.  This is a problem that will continue to be there for many years!  Our help? Our donations? Will only last for so long, then what's her plan.   Does anyone out there have positive thoughts that may help me to understand that side?

20090227064519AA6DO7G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please give me some advice to help a friend!?	Hello and thanks for helping me!      My best friend, which I know since we were 6 years old and I am 20 now is in a horrible emotional situation. She broke up with her boyfriend 3 months ago, they started talking again, he mentioned getting back together but they haven't. Sometimes he says nice things to her, then he treats her any of her friends. She will see him tonight and she want to make things clear! Sometimes it seems as if he loves her, and then with anger because she made mistakes and made him feel bad.       What can she tell him? She still loves him by the way!
20090304113541AAH0N7q	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with a semi-close friend who is habitually pessimistic?	Last year I became friends with another girl through the internet, and we seemed to have tons in common.  She's gorgeous, we still have things in common, and we hang out regularly.  The only problem is....      She is negative about everything!  The first few times we hung out everything seemed fine.  Then, I guess as we got "closer" she starts criticizing and pointing out the negative of everything.  If my boyfriend doesn't say "hi" when she comes over, she assumes he is ignoring her and mad at her.  I know her and I both have had depression in the past..and I know it must play a role in this.  But when I tell her that it's best in life to ignore the small things, because there are other things so much worse..she criticizes my point of view saying that I don't care about her feelings.  She posts blogs and bulletines on facebook/myspace saying that her friends aren't there for her, and that she thinks it's very likely that the friends she has now will be fair-weather.  It's a little embarassing to have her over and listen to her complain all the time, every time.        Now, it would be easy to say - oh, you met her online?  That's stupid anyway, so why not just stop talking to her?       The problem with that is, she made friendships with my other close friends.  She actually kind of pushed friendship on them, asking them to do favors for her and things like that.  We all think she's a little crazy, but she's like interwoven into my social network now.  Plus I don't want to make her depression (if it's still active) worse by cutting her off.      So ultimately, what I need to know is how do you deal with someone who is consistenly negative?  Someone who thinks that being positive means ignoring her problems?  Someone who criticizes everything?

20090227065252AA9NK0U	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Not having a regular "rehersal dinner", and bridal shower tomorrow; would like to give Maids gifts then, OK?	Our wedding is a very simply 15 minute walk down the aisle type thing. Very low key ect. Everyone except the 2 flwr girls and the 2 ringbrs have either been in/or had a wedding. The day of the wedding we are doing pictures prior to the ceremony (recpetion/ceremony/bridal suit all at one location). So after we are done pictures, the coordinator is going to do a brief run through so everyone is 100% as to what to do. Because the location is about 1hr from us, some people (ourselves) will be staying at families homes/hotels near the location. Other bridesmaid/relatvies/guests will be staying where we all basically live an hr away. So the Saturday/sunday prior my MIL is going to have everyone over and get some pizza ect. To me that isn't really the atmosphere that I want to give my bridesmaids their gifts in. Tomorrow is my shower, and I was wondering if at anytime during; or after it is acceptable for me to give them their gifts. I got the 3 maids necklaces from Juicy, and the MOH a juicy handbag. The necklaces aren't necessarliy ones that I want them to/or expect them to wear in the wedding. THey are all different and remind me a bit of that person. And obviously my MOH can't wear for it. I was thinking DURING the end of the shower when I'm thanking them for all their work ect. sort of toasting (without an actual toast) for all their hardowkr. But some people told me the shwoer is only for me and to wait until after when it's more private. So that is the other option. Qhat do you think is better?

20090304114516AAK3N85	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my dad cheating on my mum?! :(?	well.. i was doing my homework and i asked my dad weather he had a calculator, and he said i could borrow the one on his phone.. he said "but don't look at my texts because that's rude and nothing to do with you."   well being the curious teenager I am, and i'm sure quite of alot of people would of.. I looked at his texts, he must be hiding something i thought.   so yes.. i looked at his texts and he'd being texting someone called    Michelle.. i was very confused because i've never heard of this Michelle person ever. I looked through the texted and it had things about meeting and stuff & what time to go online.   i'd realised over the past couple of weeks my dad panics every time i go near his laptop, and if i'm sat at the table while he's sat across from me he'll make sure i can't see anything.. I looked on his computer the other day and noticed he'd being deleting his browsing history, he'd also made a hotmail account. He's normally on AOL and shares an account with my mum, so it could be possible he's trying to hide something? I also went on his computer today and noticed he had a photo called, Michelle. I opened it up and it had pictures of this pretty blonde, she looked around the age of my dad.    I know I shouldn't be so nosey but there's deffo something fishy going on..   What should I do?   Have a word with my mum or look further into it.   :(

20090304112048AAIWROZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband on drugs?	Last summer my husband just up and left. Our marriage was good, etc. Before this I had noticed that he came home one day with large pupils. He had also begun flying off the handle for no reason. We found a bottle of a relatives Vicodin that was prescribed with a count of 60 (the relative took 2) down to 16 in the bottle. He had begun talking about taking Vicodin for headaches and throat pain. He sort of denied the abuse, but I told someone in front of him that he had a drug problem and he just looked down while saying nothing. Never tried to stand up for himself.      He lives with his mother and refuses to speak to me. He has caused a rift with the whole family and never sees our son either. His family & I are really close, but he and his family are not. He called his brother on a landline phone that matched a guy's house or apt. Could this be his dealer?      Is there a 1800 # I can call to ask about the symptoms?

20090304112802AAmhS1m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesn't my boyfriend want to have sex with me?	I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year now, and we have an amazing relationship.  However recently, in the past few months, we rarely have sex..  especially compared to the months prior.  We're both in school, and his major is really hard.  He says it's just stress, and school, and being broke all the time (I mean we are in college).  But i'ts REALLY hard to believe.        He's always loving and affectionate.  I mean, we cuddle all night, he tells me how much he loves me all the time, and I believe it.  I know he loves me, but I don't feel like he's attracted to me anymore because of the sex thing.  I feel like if he was still as sexually and physically attracted to me as before, he wouldn't be able to keep his hands off of me.      Is our relationship doomed?  I don't feel like when you're in your twenties you should be having a "rut" sexually with your boyfriend.  Has anyone else experienced this, and hopefully, had it pass and turn our perfect in the end??

20090304110641AA9VRBX	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do all women switch from happy and loving to "everything is wrong" state regularly?	Have just read, that EVERY woman goes through the cycles from being happy and caring for people around her to the state where everything is wrong and she is all negative.   I'm pretty sure to be as stable as rock then it comes to emotional states, but then again, i am male.      Is it then absolute rule for every woman to switch the state not because somebody done something, but because  it is natural? Or many would claim as i do to be emotionally stable and with changes in mood only if there is a reason??      Here is my source:    http://uk.askmen.com/dating/dating_advic...

He wanted me to move in with him really bad and eventully after a few months was convinced he wanted to marry me.    He stayed with me for a year till we broke up. I had a lot of issues faught with him a lot . I feel like if i didn't cry on his foot step many times for him back after a fight witch started small and ended up big because i felt he didn't love me he wouldn"t have dated me for that long.

He tells me he loves me and is nicer than before but i feel he doesn't know what love is he is just infatuated by me.      Does he love me because he has been with me longer than anyone else or is it infatuation and he is still around because i keep him around?

20090304112757AAs5lmA	Family & Relationships;Friends	My mom's birthday is coming up, only thing is this is her last birthday.?	She just joined the hospic program so in about 3 mos we'll no longer have her. I have some family drama going back from when I was conceived between my grandma and her sister. Well my Great Aunt (who my mom says is like her 2nd mom) has decided to throw a birthday party for my mom and my great Uncle who is turning 73 I believe. My grandma already said she wouldn't come. Thats alright I'm not going to presure her. She just lost a son not even a year ago so I'm sure she is going through a lot right now. Thing is, My great Aunt called my mom about a year ago. I guess my G-ma had told someone and it got back to her that my mom had only 2-6 mos left. It was true at the time. The Dr. said the same thing to me. We all got mad because we felt it was in bad judgement to call her up asking if it was true. Well, my Aunt (my mom's sister) got into an arguement with my great aunt about it last week and hung up on her. My great aunt called and said she wouldn't be at the party but she'd still pay for the cake and such. I asked if my aunt (mom's sis) didn't come if she would and she said probably. Normaly I'd feel that if she didn't want to come then its her loss. But because this is my mom's last birthday I feel I should just have a seperate party for my grandma and my mom's sister and her friends. Thing is... My moms sister don't want to miss the party my aunt is throwing, I think just to despite my great aunt. I feel my mom's sister is being selfish. I think everyone needs to celebrate my mom's bday with her not only for mi mom, but for themselves. For clouser. (sorry I can't spell) So if it takes my mom's sister to not come to get my great aunt to come then so be it. Why does she need to come to both parties anyways? Should I tell her not to come? If so how? She is very hot headed and last thing I need is more drama. Its hard enough taking care of my mom and sister in the process.

20090304113628AA330e5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to handle a guys mixed feelings?	I've been seeing this guy off and on, mostly texting and it went great for a while. We kept in touch everyday and saw each other at least once a week (we live 1 1/2 hours away from each other).  That has not been an issue.  We've slept with each other 4 times and it was wonderful. He got to where he stopped returning my texts and it pissed me off so I stopped texting for a couple of days and then all of a sudden he had time to text for 2 hours last night. What's up with that?

Just to be on the safe side we will call them x and y.The thing is that they are stuck to each other like super super glue and it's obvious that they don't like me, at least not as much as I like them.      The thing that definitely proves they don't like is that last last Friday I went to sit next to x in the canteen x told me that she had saved the seat for somebody else and y looked awkward so I sat somewhere on the same table and everyone on the table looked awkward so I asked what was going on and y told me to sit back where had first sat because nobody was going to sit there. They just wanted me to go away and x looked awkward for the rest of the meal. If it had been anyone else I would have put my pudding in their face but the fact is I like them so much.   There have been other incidences too like in P.E. when we were told to get into groups of three and I decided to join them but they just sighed. There have been lots of other icedences as well but if I told them all I'd be hee rill midnight.      The real question is that I really want to make friends with them but how? Please no answers like don't bother with them girls like that are not worth fighting for. Please I like them sooooooooooooooooooo much. Help.

20090304114146AA8ZGCr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should i do with this situation?	I have been with my current girlfriend for nearly 4 months and get on great. Really caring towards each other. Always there for each other. Feels very loyal and we never argue. She is 22 younger than me (im 27)and sometimes i feel like i am "mothering" her and try to look after her than i normally would as i normally go for older girls. Everything has improved since being with her i.e. job, money etc.. and im full of confidence.   A girl in the office upstairs has started and is 25, and she is absolutely beautiful, very pretty and all the lads just love her to bits. I have been speaking alot recently and she is coming to the end of relationship with her bloke. She has been saying how guilty she feels spending time talking to me when we both clearly know we fancy each other like mad.. and she is confused. (neither of us are looking to leave our current partners) but its like we are besotted with each other.. i cant stop watching her and looks wise she is my ideal girl.   Im just a bit confused and wished i had never met her! lol.   I dont know if i should feel so jumpy around someone when im with my girlfriend. I feel awful as only last week me and the g/f came back off holiday after havng a brillaint time. I think part of the attraction is fancying somone my age and feeling on a similiar age wave length..      aargghh so confusing

20090304125158AARLmTN	Family & Relationships;Family	How can i stop comparing myself to my sister and...?	Hello,   I have a fraternal twin sister. We're freshmen in high school. I have very low self confidence, like no self esteem. She is curvier than me, but im thinner. My boobs are huge for my body, and hers are normal and prettier. Her hair is beautiful, she can wear it curly or wavy. I get reeally anxious in public, i sweat so badly and i am not good at holding conversations unless its with my close friends. As a freshman, i have barely made connections with the other kids in high school this year. Like i know who i want to be friends with, but im way too shy to make it happen. My sister is outgoing and pretty, we're both in honors classes but she gets high 90s (99-100) ALL the time, and i am getting 70s or 80s. But like i really am trying, i study a lot and do all my homework! And all my life, we've shared almost everything, and she's always been the outgoing one. I'd really like to branch out from her, i mean like seriously make decisions and live my own life, but its so hard when i always compare myself to everyone around me and especially her. It seems like the expectations in school are high for everyone to be loud and talkative all the time, but really im quiet and it makes me feelso bad about myself. I've been struggling with my self esteem for so long, i just hate this so much, i've tried to change its really hard.      Thanks for taking the time to read this, PLEASE give me any positive advice you can! :) Thanks!

20090304125128AAmyP67	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I invite my future sisters in law to my bachelorette party?	My fiance's two sisters are not in the bridal party and we're not super close.  I just had my bridal shower this past saturday, they had a great time and got us a bunch of awesome gifts.  In the car ride on the way home, they started asking what I'm doing for the bachelorette party and saying "that sounds like it'll be so fun!", making it sound like it's implied they would be invited.      I originally felt a little strange about having them there (even though we're not having strippers) because it's my chance to have fun, act stupid and get sex toys and lingerie without having them report and misinterpret everything for their brother. (not that I'm planning on doing anything, but it just feels weird to talk about sex in front of my future husband's sisters!)  At the same time, I'm thinking it's not a good idea to alienate and offend people who will be my family in a month and a half.      Suggestions?
20090304125109AAZ1ObI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i help beat the s.h.i.t outta her?	ok so this girl that Im am friends with have started saying a load of s.h.i.t about me and my bf and my other friend and she has also cheated on her boyfriend.   We tried to tell her to stop and everything but she just wont! and we told her bf that she was cheating on him but he wont believe us :(   She told everyone that my friend "lola" had slept with all her bfs and is  totally a s.l.u.t so no one will go out with her.   shes told everyone she knows that i was going to dump my bf that i just started going out with because i liked a different guy and that was NOT true at all   Also me and "Lola" have decide to take her out behind a store and beat the living s.h.i.t out of her but i don't know if i should.She has always been there for me but now shes turning on me and telling everyone alot of s.h.i.t about me!   what should i do?
20090304121731AASrNJl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Yes or no: Does she like me?	All right let me break this down for you.      I like this girl whose been friends with me for a good year, but we havent talked to each other for about 2 months, and im just starting to briefly keep in contact with her.      Anyway, Im starting to think she likes me back, and these are the reasons why:      1. She hated that I liked her close friend, she always told me that we wouldnt go together and that she was too slutty and too much of a party girl for me. She was the first to tell me that the girl I used to like (her close friend) chopped her hair off and got her braces back on (dont worry im in high school).      2. She confronted my other friend who i've been friends with since diapers, and asked her if me and her were going out - oddly enough Ive never talked to this friend around her, so I don't even know how she found out we were friends.      3. She talks about guys she likes around me, but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who she tells and I'm not her absolute best friend. She puts me in hypothetical situations involving guys she thinks are hot or cute or w/e, but mostly doesnt admit to liking them - or admits to liking them in the past.      4. She noticed that I started being friends with this other girl (who I still never mentioned and never talked to infront of her) and one time this guy who liked my new friend went up to the girl I like and said "whats with him does he like her?" and the girl I like responded "uhh i definately think he likes her" in a really sad tone im told. The fact that she even could have thought that from rarely even seeing us first hand is a bit suprising.      5. In a more recent conversation she said that she missed me, that we should hang out soon, and randomly asked if I liked anyone new.      6. She said im "one of the funniest people shes ever met", even though everyone else would say I'm not that funny, and im not a goof or a clown either.      I really like her and I think we could be pretty awesome together - i could go on and on about how i like her but Ill save u guys the trouble, even though Ive always wanted to tell her i liked her from day one and it hurts to hold it in.      So do you think she likes me?

20090304120703AAUxgcH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you discuss sexual fantasies with your spouse without it becoming threatening?	I personally don't think it's all that uncommon to have sexual fantasies which you in no way *expect* your spouse to try to help you fulfill.  So how do you tell your spouse those things without them feeling threatening, in a way that they know you honestly do not expect them to be fulfilled?      Example: Lots of people fantasize what it would be like to have a threesome, but would never want nor expect their spouse to actually help them make such a fantasy come true.  This is just one example - there are surely many others.      I am not asking you to advise me - what I want to know is how you have handled telling your spouse such a thing, or, if you've never done it, how you imagine you would handle it.  Alternatively, maybe you think you should just always keep such thoughts completely secret - if so, please explain.

20090304123604AAGTcNV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I reading too much into this?	I still love this man, I missed my chance with him a few times,he got cold, we work together but could avoid each other if we wanted. I never got in his face after initially (after a big fight) tried to talk to him and he was having none of it. It got to the point that he would see me and walk away. So I asked him if I had offended or hurt him afresh. He said no. the day we couldnt talk about how we felt about things was the day it was over between us. So we resumed workplace acquintance, then he got cold again. Then one of his female fan club turned really nasty on me and he did too, then she said something while he and I were talking and he was OK again. I got afraid something was going on between them and stepped away, but she got so hostile, in the end, I told him what was going down. He said he knew nothing about it. He has been nicer to me,not taking sides (that is why i liked him, he is very fair) but I dont know what to do? I still like him, but dont want to express that in case he thinks I am playing a game. I genuinely smelt a rat and cleared my name with him. But he is making an effort ( though holds back) to appear friendly again.Yet at other times, it's like he is making sure I don't get the wrong idea? I dunno what to do. Is it true or fair that a man will come after you again if he truly wants you? I don't want to make a fool of him or me by saying I still love you. I genuinely see him as an equal, but am afraid that by being loose about it and seeming not to love him, I am discouraging him maybe if he did like me still. See my insecurity meant I never really flirted or went for it like other women do. He feels sorry for me, I am sure of that, but he is trying. If he was afraid I would get into him, would he do even that? I mean if he sees me he tries to talk to me and I am responding?

20090304124802AA2l75j	Family & Relationships;Family	Please answer?!?!? Awkwardness?	Well, my fiance, Patrick, and I live in a different state than my family,and my 15 year old sister, Nicole, is coming to stay with us next week. I'm really excited to spend some time with her, because we don't see each other very much now. However, last time she stayed here, I kind of sensed this... awkward feeling between her and Patrick and I... Like, when he would go to work, he'd kiss me goodbye (Just a peck), and I'd sense this awkwardness with Nicole and I after that for a bit... I know she likes Patrick, so it's not that, but it's just... weird... Why do you think this happens? Everytime he'll kiss me or touch me or something (Obviously not sexually, or anything... just like, hugging me, a peck on the lips, holding my hand, etc...) And she stays in our guest room, but if she needs something in the evening and we're in our room just watching TV, she won't go in, or she'll just kind of awkwardly, quietly ask for what she needs... It's weird... It's not like we have sex when she's there or anything... What should I do to make her feel more comfortable? Also, any clue as to what's going on here??

20090304131226AABtcmD	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do to stop being so mad at my friends?	I have known them since 6th grade which was last year. I invite them to everything i can and of course they come. So one of them had a birthday party and they didnt invite me. I don't care that they didnt, but they found my nerves when they talked about it in front of me, handed shirts they made to the people who couldn't make it. We needed a partner for a L.A project and I feel like they play rock paper scissors to decide who is "stuck" with me. usually its this one girl who lives near me. So i waited for them to pick me and of course they didnt even talk to me. so another girl in a different "clique" thing asked me. we are friends but not like sit with each other at lunch friends. so she had crayola pip-squeak markers and the people i hate kept asking to use them. then they didnt ask and they still took it. they act like im bffs when i have something i want. what can i do to get over how angry i am. maybe it has everything to do with balancing grades, being healthy, keeping my face clear, homework, and keeping my stress towards my sister down.

20090304125322AAzdObH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Are you really interested in men?	I met this girl at a shoe store. I think she gave me the green light with lots of eye contact and smiles. She would gaze at me for a ‘LONG TIME’ and hold that smile for longer than 4-6 seconds. She did it more than 3 times! Obviously, I asked for her help in selecting shoes. It went pretty well but then before leaving, I asked if she wanted to go out. She let me know she was busy and asked for my business card, which I kindly handed to her. I left with her giving me that long gaze again and that really beautiful deep smile (another 4-6 seconds). It’s been 2-3 days since I haven’t heard from her. Am I being played for a fool or is she really interested in me?       And I really forgot to ask for her contact information. So should I go back and ask for it or just wait?

20090304132928AA8MTEB	Family & Relationships;Friends	I believe my friend doesn't live in this generation. Any suggestion?	I have a friend who has been raised by a very strict family, especially her dad. She said shirtless guys are perverted. I, however, think that it's normal for a guy to be shirtless. Some take off their shirts when they exercise, want to relax on a hot day, or on the beach. She believes those are the ones with no manners. Then she said even I think seeing naked people on the street is normal. I think she considers being shirtless is being naked. She told me yesterday a boy touched one of my classmate's boobs, and she believed he wanted her naked. Now, I know this boy isn't like that. I told her maybe they were playing around. I told her that she lives in the 1960s in a joking manner, and she said she's not old style, she just doesn't like to be a pervert. I asked her what she wears when she goes to the beach, she said her clothes. She said it's wrong to look at people's bodies. But I told her that you can't live your whole life looking at a person's face. You just might accidentally lower your gaze at a lady's boobs. She said people do that on purpose most of the time. She said this generation are filled with perverts. Now...should i just leave her thinking that way?
20090304123418AAiCe42	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I put a stop to this?	I am very good friends with 2 other women, Kary and Lisa.  The problem is whenever Lisa is not around Kary runs her down to me saying how she is bad mother and a big mouth blah blah blah.  Whenever Kary is not around Lisa runs her down to me saying she is immature, dirty-she actual says she smells!  Its crazy, but when they are around each other butter wouldn't melt in their mouths.  I don't get it.  I don't talk about either one of them.  When one starts telling me about the other I say what I think. If I agree with the point she is making I tell her I do, but if not I tell her so too.  I have never said anything behind either of their back that I haven't said to their face.  I am very open and perhaps out spoken, but I am honest.  A trait neither one of them have towards each other.  The thing I don't get is they only talk about each other, not our other friends.  I've told them I don't get off on talking about other people and change the subject, but they always bring it back.  My question is-Should I just come out and say, "Listen-you both talk trash about each other and Im tired of hearing it so go talk to each other."  That is what I want to say, but my boyfriend thinks this will cause a big problem and they will end up being mad at me.  HELP!   They are driving me crazy!!
20090304124238AAaHErL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(embarrassing, drunk story) anyone wanna answer please?	So, there is this guy I like...like reaaaaallly like!..and he is a really good friend. Me and my sister went to visit him for his birthday for the weekend so we stayed at his apartment.(he lives about 3 hours away now) So, He had this party with a bunch of his friends at his place and everyone got pretty drunk.. I know I got wasted..and I have never gotten this drunk before in my life..so my sister got sick and puked..and he took her to go sleep in his bed..so that night was is pretty fuzzy to me before I know it I'm getting really sick and I guess I puked too.. I had way to many shots.. of different kinds of liquor..never again lol. but anyway I remember him helping me and taking me to the bathroom and being really sweet just helping me get cleaned up and and barely remember this but I was holding onto him like hugging after that.. but that's all I can remember..and I know I must have done something stupid or said something stupid but I can't remember..becuase last night I talked to him on IM and and he said that he thinks I should be promoted..and of course I didn't know what he was talking about..so I asked him promoted to what? or promoted from what?? lol.. and he said loser..(we like to tease eachother and call eachother names) so he always playfully calls me loser lol. and I always call him a geek. but anyway he came up with this super sweet nickname for me a certain type of flower.. and I made a joke and said .."hm I was thinking like..um.. pukey???....not" just playing around   and he said "lol,well...that could be our little secret.....haha"      so now I am like OMG I can't remember half that night...I know I like him so much..I probably did or said something really stupid..      because earlier in the night his friends were telling me I should kiss him because it was his birthday and i was like nooooo.. and they took me over to him and told him I wanted to kiss him.. ahh I denied it..but I don't remember much too long after that point.. but I remember him taking me and putting me in bed after being in the bathroom.. So I have a feeling I might have tried to kiss him or I said I wanted to kiss him I have no Idea......         *sigh* he is such a sweet guy... this is embarrassing I don't know if I should ask if I did or said anything that night.. because I simple can't remember.. what would you do??                  BTW I have learned my lesson with alcohol lol

20090304124527AANHzgc	Family & Relationships;Family	What is wrong with my brother in law?	My brother in law keeps doing things and he never fails to surprise me. I think 'this is as low as he can get' then he gets even lower!       Okay 8 months ago he had sex with a girl he worked with and got her preggy.       Some time passed and on V-day he had unprotected sex with another chick. (shes not pretty tho, I think she was on the pill.)       Now hes dating his best friends ex girlfriend! she is also having a baby! HIS best friends baby!  He is trying to presure her into having sex with him!       Not only this but the 1st chick (the one he got pretty) they dont even know if the baby is his (she claims it is tho) but she slept around with like 3 other guys unprotected.       He could be passing STD"s because he has some signs but wont go get checked, I told him i would pay for him to get checked but he said he dosnt want to because then he might find out he has them,       so if he has sex with the preggy girl, will it hurt her baby?      should I tell her?   Or just let her have sex with him its her prob for being such a hussy right?

I know I've been asking this before....but I really need your help....   This is the story...I'm 35 very active, I'm attractive and smart and have a good job....but I'm still single....was married before, didn't work!   I like Salsa dancing but just as a hobby not too attached to it!   I'm in in LA and I went Salsa dancing to a club close to my place, after couple of times, I met a guy there, I liked his look because he looked like my ex-boyfriend that I'm still in love with ( we got seperated because I moved to LA and he had three kids...i couldn't stay with him)   anyway....this guy asked my number to text me his dance class info...I was thinking I don't want to give my phone number to a guy in the club....so, I was thinking I will give him a wrong number, but then I changed my mind, but then I think I gave him a wrong number....he didn't call me...next week I went back to the club and I saw him...he told me if I got the text message, I said I might gave you a wrong number....and yes it was a wrong number....I corrected this time...and again no call from him....then I didn't go to the club...after three weeks I went back to the club...and he told me that I gave a wrong number again...i checked it and yes the last number was wrong...I thought he might changed it....I don't know...couldn't trust him...anyway, I corrected the number....and our relationship starts like this...he kept texting me to go to the club and I didn't want to go...anyway...one day I changed my mind and I went to another club he was in....and we talked and we liked each other....and we start going out....but I didn't like the way that he was treating me in the dance class and club...he had his distance form me...I told him after a month going out that i want to break up, because of this....he got so upset....he said he will tell everybody that I'm his girlfriend....and he acted a little bit like that....but still not fullfilling....I didn't complain this time....Sunday we went to the club and he danced with me a llittle bit then he kept his distance and he kept dancing with another girl and I talking to her while I'm either standing alone or sitting alone by myself and i was tired and hungry....I saw him giving a business card to that girl...I know that was a teacher's business card, but I really couldn't take it...I didn't complain...no need to fix this guy....I had to leave....i told him I want to leave...I'm tired....he said, you are mad at me I just gave that girl our teacher's business card I want to give our teacher business....I said...I'm not mad and that's okay....then I stayed a bit longer there....then I found out he doesn't care about me....and he kept dancing with the other girl...now I'm really tired and sad....I told him I want to go...He said, I will walk you home....I said it's okay I go...he insisted...then walking me home I told him...you don't comprmise at all...what would happen if you leave fifteen or half an hour earlier because I'm tired....I said I don't think we build up frienship yet...he said oh I'm your friend....then he starts being so cold and he told me mean stuff like oh I can't make you happy....you are always unhappy after the club and I denied....he dumped me....in front of my home, he told me I don't come upstairs...i asked him to come upstairs...and he said no...he said...I can walk away from you right now....and he was so cold...i hugged him and he pushed me away....we've been going out just for two months but it was so hurtful seeing that....I know i don't want him in my life....but it was so shocking for me...a guy who was giving me so much attention and all of a sudden got like that!   I know it's good to see his true face, but how many times I got to go through such a relationships....I'm so tired and I don't like beating myself up for him....I'm not going to contact him and I dont' have plan to answer his phone if he calls....I dont' go to the dance class even though I paid for it....I don't want to see him anymore at all....   but the question is how to let it go? and why it didn't work? was there anything that I did wrong really?   thanks in advance for reading my story and answering it....
20090304115849AAyv2nk	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do if your sister in law asked you this?	My husband's brother and his wife  recently had a baby who is physically challenged. The baby is now 9 months old, and is very difficult to care for. She is terrified of anyone other than her parents. Including family who see's her daily. When you hold her, she screams non stop. As is impossible to calm down. My sister in law asked me yesterday if I would take care of the baby for her and her husband while they went out of town for a couple days. I have never even watched her for an hour let alone a night. But, they have no other choice, no one else is willing to do it. My husband and I already have 3 kids, 6, 7, and 8. And we have our hands full. I feel bad to tell her no, seeing as i understand needing to get away for awhile. But I do not feel comfortable taking care of her for 2 days and nights.    So my question is, how do I tell her without lying to her, how do I tell her without her being angry with us? Or should I just go ahead and do it anyway?
20090304130414AAM1htm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex-husband wants custody of our children. What do you think?	My ex-husband and I were divorced in July 08. I was awarded "sole physical custody with joint legal custody with him". I moved out of the house, but allowed my children to spend the nights at his house. I have my two children during the day, and they sleep there at night. His house is the only house they know, their friends and school are at his house. It's very hard for me to not have them here at night. We did it that way so they would still see us both every day.      Well, now he wants me to sign "physical custody" over to him with me having "joint legal custody". I can't even fathom doing this. It literally makes me cry to just think about it.      Any advice?      Please and thank you.

Ok me and my girl being in a relationship for over 4 yrs. i am much older than she is.. and i dont know if i am taking this the wrong way... she works at a grocery store she has told me in many occasion her workmates are always making fun of her because when we got to the store together  she doesnt speak to anyone like if i get mad or my face expression changes so they tease her about her being afraid to talk to anyone which it bothers me in some way.. well in one occasion we were talking about something i dont remeber right now but she brought u  the issue about when i go to the store she says i dress like a homeless person and that  i have better to wear and how it bothers her when i dress in a way that to her i look like that.. i felt hurt when she said that.. i dont think i dress bad and i wear what i have to wear.. but since i am older than her it makes me feel bad.. makes me wonder if she is ashamed of me or something even tho she says she isnt..we go out everywhere together when she is at home.. i never go out alone which i dont mind.. but yesterday it was her day off and she needed to go to her work place to bring a car of a friend that she was gonna work on.. i was getting dressed and ready to go with her.. but she said.. i will be back gonna go pick up the car do u need anything from the store? and i said .. you will be right back? u never say that u usuall ask me to come with u.. we never go out by ourselves? she got upset and said i will be back soon.. So i felt hurt..i remembered the time she said i dress like a homeless person.. i thought maybe she was ashamed of me as well cause i am much older... did i take it the wrong way..? at the end she did leave with out me.. i stayed home .. as i tried not to give it thought..many things came to my mind and i would tear up tryin not to think anymore and not cry.. but that hurts.. am i wrong here to feel this way???

20090304121351AA6d01f	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What could I offer in our uncontested divorce to pursuade my husband...?	to forego unsupervised visitations until the babies are older?      I am willing to let him see the children daily if he's not unsupervised. Everytime he has ever cared for the babies, even while I bathe, they have gotten physically hurt. He also leaves them dirty and exposes them to the cold, without coats or socks, he loses track of time and lets them stay up until 2 in the morning, he feeds them chilli all day and they get sick. If I ever let him watch after them, he behaves this way and finds it suitable. His parents are very trashy and taught him that this was acceptable childcare. He mocks the standards of a church nursery or the YMCA as being ridiculous.   I documented all of it beginning  a year ago in preparation for divorce. I want uncontested.   Tell me some things I might offer him if he'll agree to always visit them with supervision of another adult.    thank you

20090304122624AAESe5J	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this a normal kids game?	So I go over to my brothers, who has FIVE children (a lot!), a newborn, a 3 1/2 yr old, a 6 yr old twins and a 7 yr old. I can hear him from outside laughing and shouting, obviously enjoying a few beers.      Anyway, his wife lets me in, also a bit tipsy, and I go into the living room and he is there with his rifle, a cigarette hanging out his mouth, posing while his drunk friend takes a photo on a Polaroid.       The weirdest thing is his two 6 yr olds and 7 yr old are making a human pyramid. He has his foot on the 7 yr old, like a foot rest, but not it a bad way he is just holding it there for as pose, not to hurt him.       His newborn was asleep, and his 3 1/2 yr old was lining toys up in his room -  he kinda usually likes playing on his own, that one.      I kinda flip out a bit, for the gun being out in the house when he is drinking but he laughs and tells me all the ammo is still locked up.      Anyway, the kids weren't crying or anything but they weren't laughing so afterwards I text my bro to say I'm not sure they were happy. He says kids love messing around and thats what they are like, how would I know I dont have any (which is true!!).      So what do you think or is my bro being a drunk idiot!!!

Everytime my girlfriend and I are hanging out at the bar or wherever else, she is a blast. She flirts around with other guys and is a good time to be around. She claims she loves her boyfriend but whenever he shows up, she will ignore everyone, pout around and put her head down on the bar and claim she is ready to go home. I feel really sorry for her man and I am a little pissed off at her. What would you do?
20090304121702AAeXD8O	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I wrong here? Car Pool Issues.?	My friend and I started carpooling a couple of weeks ago.   My car wasn't working anymore and they raised the price of parking at my friend's job. As a solution, my friend would get me, I'd drop her off, I would then drive the car about a mile and then park by my work because our parking is free in our building. We split the gas and it would benefit the both of us. I would have a way to work and my friend would not have to pay $17 a day for parking.       Recently she has started taking several fitness classes after work 2-4 nights a week. She can't park at her gym, because, you guessed it, they also charge to park. She will get done anywhere from 3-4 hours after work. By that time I am at home and spending time with my children. At first I would pick her up from the gym since it was her car. Now she expects it all the time. Lately I left it by the sitter's house, a mutual friend of ours. After work she would either get a ride to the gym or take public transportation and do the same to get home or to our friend's house. I did this because I explained that I could not get her that late. She was fine and said to leave it by our friend's.    Apparently, instead of telling me that the situation isn't working, she has bad mouthed me to our circle of friends. She tells them I take her for granted and that I should realize she is helping me.       So, I ask, am I wrong here?   This was not a part of our agreement. Should I have to pick her up?   And secondly should I not be angry my friends are approaching me with this and not her?

I was about to run upstairs and put some clothes on, but Stupid Wildo yanked my towel off and opened the door really fast.      They started at me with wide eyes. I had to cover up my tiny penis and run upstairs screaming like a girl.      all my other clothes were dirty so I had to put on a gay shirt that said 'I like Dick' (It was my gay friends).      From this day they still laugh about it.      Why?!      Tell me why?!

Their  both short, their both Londoners, and they both have the same kind of 'look', I could go on. I watch Top Gear alot, but it makes me feel a little upset when Hammond appears, also because Dad's changed alot now.he used to have the same kind of style as Hammond too. (way wierd, I know.) With the whole, slightly spiked hair, shirt, wooden necklace thingy. Now dad's got a new girlfriend, hes got his nose pierce back ( from 15 years back) Leather Motorbike Jacket, Wierd coloured Vans, It's too different. I'd like him to go back as he was.more relaxed, not trying to be 17 all the time. I know I can't change who he is, but remembering what he was hurts.    The logical explanation of coarse would be to stop watching Top Gear, but thats not the main reason. Its just memories I cant get rid of. What can I do??   Jas x

20090304122532AAO8F0y	Family & Relationships;Weddings	To elope or not to elope?! That is the question. ;)?	My boyfriend of 3 years just recently proposed to me and I've immediately got to thinking about how I would like the wedding to be. I have always, always wanted a beach ceremony. My finance loved the idea of having it beachside. Neither of us care if it's a big ceremony or just a small one. We've even discussed just eloping. The more I think about it, the more I love the idea of eloping. Well, a planned eloping...where we tell everyone we're running off to the beach to get married and take along our parents and siblings. I want a small, romantic, relaxing ceremony. I found the perfect place here on the coast of NC. The official is a self proclaimed "beach crab" and is super laid back and makes is relaxing and fun. And he does his thing in packages! The best package having the ceremony, 20 chairs, photos, the sand unity thing, the whole nine yards for a little less than $3000. He even can do a thing at the end of "taking the plunge" where you jump into the ocean at the end, which I thought was very neat.       My question is this. I have a relatively small family. All of my close family is in NC, but grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc...are spread out everywhere and probably couldn't come to a formal wedding anyway. Most of the planned eloping beach packages I've seen online are kept under 20 people, which on my side my close family would only be 6. I don't really have many close friends. But my fiances family on the other hand is huge and they are all in NC, with the exception of a few in Maryland. And they probably would come down for a wedding, since they have for all the others in his family. He's got 2 sisters and a brother and tons and tons of cousins and cousin's children...and they're all really close. If we did my parents, stepparents and brothers, his parents, sisters and brother we would be under 20. But is it rude to invite them and not everyone? Even if we let them know it's just parents and siblings and that we'd have a huge reception when we got back? I don't think it should be a big deal because most people mainly like the reception anyway, everyone loves free food and alcohol. I just don't want anyone to be upset with us if we do it this way, since everyone else in his family has had a large, formal wedding.
20090304123309AAxBckC	Family & Relationships;Family	How could I ever forgive my mother, for ignoring my birthday?	I can't believe I'm posting about this but I have to vent. My 30th birthday was yesterday and I didn't even get a card/happy birthday wish from either of my parents, (They are still married)      My mother and I have a very turbulent relationship. She has some issues and resentment towards me, but she has never let my birthday go by and not say anything. She always got me a card/Gift but this year, not ONE word. I don't mean to sound immature and I'm an adult but my gosh, I turned 30! I think that is kind of a big birthday. I'm very hurt and I will NEVER forget this..      My father does whatever she says, so part of me thinks she told him not to bother, just to hurt me. I have NEVER let a birthday go by for my parents.

20090304115806AAhIEc5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband stays out all the time?	For the last year and a half my husband says he has given up, so he literally gave up. He has been going out pretty much everynight and stays out very late. I at one point feel I use to be a cool wife, I would allow him to go out so long as he tells me what his plans are, if he is going to be really late then call. But for some reason he started going out and not calling, and telling me he is doing one thing and then I learn he is doing something else. Finally in our last blow out this past weekend when he didnt come home to 5:30am he admitted to kissing another woman 6 months ago... and all I keep thinking about is how Ive been asking and asking if anything has happened with anyone, and would be best if you just tell, yada yada... and now he says this. How can I believe that there is really nothing else.    We have a son who is 3 so there is a lot to think about, but at the same time not. My husbands job is a Tattoo Artist....60 hours a week, and all the ladies you can imagine. The only way I see us working is for him to quit his job and lose all his friends and then deal with my insecurities for a while...is it worth it?

OK so there is this guy, i loved him with all of my whole heart. But i couldn't have him (and not because he had a GF) and i wanted him SO bad. Every time i was around him i would get SO nervous and jumpy. I would think WAY to hard about everything i said to him. Now i don't see him often but today i spent like an hour with him and i wasn't nervous or jittery and i didn't think at all about what i said i just said it. My friends have been trying to get me over him so hard, and i kinda started to separate from him when he showed up today. Why did my emotions change so suddenly? Does this mean i don't love him? Why am i so sad now if i just spent an hour with someone i love and don't see that often??!!

I told him when we moved to the new house i dont want him to take the snakes with him. So we left them in the old house but we still go there twice a week to visit our old house and his pet snakes. I was off work today and I am cleaning the house and I was screaming because Im very scared of the snakes he hide under the sink of our bathroom on their cage. I ask him why are these snakes are here and he yelled at me like this "God Damn it! Its so cold in the other house, why are you always trying to find a problem?" I am so disappointed and broken hearted because I am terrified of snakes. I dont know what to do and I dont know who to talk to so I am hoping the some people here will give me an advices here.

I'm really ready to settle down in a relationship but i just can't find a guy!   i finally got with the guy i'd loved for 2 years in the summer, but after a day i hated his guts! i just hated the fact that he was so cheesy and clingy and i suddenlt found him SO unattractive! i thought i'd have to give it some time and ended up staying with him for the worst three weeks of my life! the exact same thing happened the summer before that, and i got close to a couple of guys since but i always start to hate them just when their falling for me! i really like a guy at the moment but he hates me and treats me like ****! it hasn't stopped me from liking him though, its like i want what i can't have! I really need some advice!!! ): x

20090304115534AA6Yxda	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What happens to the gifts a groom gives his bride during marriage when the couple is getting divorced?	We were married for three years and now we are in the process of getting divorced. During wedding my in laws gave me few gold necklaces. Now that we are getting divorced, they are claiming it back. After three years of marriage it was revealed by them that my husband is a GAY and to hide the same they have tortured me to great extent. Just on humanity sake I didn't ask for any alimony. But to hide their fault, they are now going around bitching about my character and throwing allegations saying I ran away with the money he earned that is why they are getting rid of me. With all this mental harassment still going on, I was wondering if its legally right to return whatever they are claiming? Or should I claim for alimony or something for all the mental harassment I am currently going through.      Thanks in advance

20090304120420AAO8pWh	Family & Relationships;Friends	More than friends? Help! What should i do!?	People are talking about it everyday! Do you like him? Does he like you? Are you two going out? Those are the repeating questions for my everyday routine.   Its starting to get annoying! We have been best friends ever since the beginning of the year and that is also when we meet. Hes one of those guys who is tall dark and handsome with green eyes and tan skin. It started with my mom asking me if he liked me after my party and my friend saying im predicting that you two are going to be going out by the end of the year. As the year went on we became more and more of good friends, and i think i was starting to like him at some times. My school was throwing a guy congeniality contest. Of course he won and he would be receiving two free prom passes. I was so proud of him! Everything seemed to be going good until a girl started talking to me.... she was like omgsh im so excited for my cuz b/c she gets to go to the prom with him ..... i was like who? and she said hes going out with my cuz..... i was just like awww that's cute....(i dont know if she said that just because they are going out or what) at that moment i just felt like crying my eyes out. (i really wanted to go to prom this year but its not looking to good) so i got a picture with him and left. When i got home i cryed and cryed.... so now im stuck b/c people are saying that hes going to take me to prom and stuff and the girl hes going out with she didnt go the the contest, he doesnt talk about her at all, and he didnt tell me that they were going out (and best friends tell best friends everything!) So i need help what should i think i like him now.... but its kinda too late...... or is it? What should i do!

20090304122709AAVie6F	Family & Relationships;Friends	My Girlfirend of 7 years would rather read Manga than hang out!?	Me and my gril have had a good relationship for 7 and a half years. We used to hang out everyday. she used to call me and want me to be with her all the time. we really do love each other and we even plan on getting married in a few years. Recently she has been less and less interested in hanging out. I asked her why shes been this way lately and she said she has manga she wants to read and that everything is fine she just wants time to read her manga. Im starting to feel like her addiction to japanese cartoons (which is ridiculous trust me i enjoy watching them with her but it makes me mad that they are more important than seeing me.) seems to be more important than me. Does anyone else think there is a problem here or should i just relax?
20090304122928AAEStZw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend wants to break up with me, why wont he say it to my face?	Awhile back he left his myspage page open when he handed the computer off to me, and when I went to use it I realized he was still signed in.. So I was curious. He has a really difficult time communicating with me about me. And I felt like something had been weird for the few months before that. Anyways he wrote to a random girl "I am trapped in a relationship with a girl I dont want to be with anymore, the only reason I stay with her is for our daughter". So after a couple days this statement was eating me up and I confronted him about it. He denied it said that it was never him who wrote that, he said "why would I write something like that, I love you". Initially I believed him, but after thinking about it and discussing it with a few friends I started to feel like it was a huge bullshit lie. After that happened I have been obsessing over finding the truth. I search everything I possibly can to figure out how he really feels about me, about us, and how we are doing in our relationship. I love him so much. I have never stopped loving him. He is everything to me and I need to know how he truly feels but every time I ask him about us. He either has nothing to say or its always a short "I'm fine". I cannot get him to share his feelings with me. We have been together for almost 5 years and it was pure bliss for the first 3-4. We never fought, everything was perfect. We were head over heals for eachother. And I dont want it to end like this. I dont want it to end at all. I have been thinking about what life would be like without him and I'm devastated just thinking about it. Picturing him with another girl makes me cry. And I know I could never move on, my love for him has always been true and I would never be able to let that go and be with someone else. I thought about coming to him and spilling my heart out about everything that I know, and telling him that if its going to take us going our seperate ways to make him happy, then I guess thats what were going to do. But I dont know if he'll ever want to take me back or not. I'm so depressed about this. I can only try to beat the truth out of him so many times and have so many attempts before I figure out that nothings working. I dont know what what to do.
20090304122944AAhYX0A	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do in this situation?	This may be a bit confusing but I'll explain as best as I can... we will just call these people Sam, Jim, Betty and me...      Sam is my boyfriend and him and my friend (or ex friend) Jim have always not liked eachother, and recently me and Betty fell out and stopped being friends with Jim because Jim spread rumours about Betty.      So yeah things were fine for a few days, and me and Betty told my boyfriend Sam about what Jim was doing so today they got into a fight (well not a real fight but they were shoving eachother and giving eachother dirty looks) and I thought it was fine because I didn't like Jim and they didn't like eachother anyway...      But then just earlier, Betty told me she was friends again with Jim! And the only reason I fell out with Jim is because of what he did to Betty so it only makes sense for me to be friends with him again... but the thing is I am not really sure if I want to be friends with Jim again!      And I can't just hang around with him again because I can't be around Jim and Sam at the same time because of the whole hating eachother thing... but Sam thinks that I don't like Jim so I can't hang around with Betty if she is with Jim...      So I really don't know what to do because of the whole Jim and Sam fighting thing... please help      sorry if that was confusing if you need any more details just ask me :)

20090304123003AA7WDC5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend is depressed and its depressing me too?	I have recently officially started going out with my best friend after we liked each other for a while, we tell each other everything so i knew that she had a history of depression and even though the last few years she had gotten a lot better she still starts feeling down once every two weeks or so.       Anyways i really like her (maybe love but i believe its too early to conclude to that) and when she gets depressed it really upsets me since i can't do anything to help her even though i care about her so much. Recently i guess it had been getting me down a lot but i have been hiding it from her since i know it would make things so much worse.      She always tries to smile and be normal when she starts feeling down when we are together but i can see through it...      Has anyone one else been through this and do you have any advice to improve the situation?      Thanks a lot!

I got to talk to her one time about a year ago and that is because my nephew was talking to her and he passed me the phone. as soon as my niece heard my voice she started crying and said they had her stranded over their and that she wanted to come home to texas. when mom found out it was me she hung up snatched the phone from her hands and hung up i only talked for about 15 seconds. she abandoned my15yr old nephew here in texas and now he is running  the streets and getting bad grades. My sister left to live with our child molesting uncle in some trailers i belive in a farm rd area where everything is deserted.

20090304124732AAM2vsY	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I ask her about this?	For years i've thought that I look nothing like my father. Apparently there is no personality resemblance either. Looking at his side of the family I just don't seen any connection.   My mother has always strongly defended herself on this matter, saying that there is no way I could be anyone else's but my mother is also known to be a chronic liar, even over the most serious of matters.      My grandmother has also mentioned that when she and my supposed father were a couple my mother was basically running a red light district in her bedroom. I firmly believe that the man she claims to be my father, really isn't. With no means of taking a DNA test ("father" is now out of the picture and isn't likely to help me solve this mystery even if I asked him to take the test) I only have her word to go on.   How can I let her know that I am serious about this.   How can I make sure that I get the truth from her?   How should I approach the subject and what are some questions I could ask to see if she's lying?

20090304125018AAA95kF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need some man advice..?	if the person you were with wasn't sure about his feelings for you, but while at the same time really cared about you and was admittedly scared of losing you, what would you do?      ( and this all being said after all the cats had been let out of the bag and so on... by this i mean things which are ultimately forgivable )      long story short, he has done alot of mean **** and in my understanding it all happened because he's selfish, VERY selfish, and also because his feelings had obviously faded somewhat significantly or he wouldn't had done what he'd done. BUT... im not stupid, and i know he is a very confused person.       from the age of four he had been part of a christian church ( which he actually referse to as a cult ). he left this " church " when he was twenty; he knows that its left some scars on him but besides all of this he is a wonderful person. but i just got tired of being hurt and feeling used so i finally broke it off.      we have broken up many times before, each time resulting in more of a mess, but this last time there was no bullshit. i told him it had to end if he wasn't sure how he felt about me and we both agreed. it was really tough on both of us.       i have been in a few relationships and i thought i knew what real love was before, but this is the first time i have ever truely fallen, and i know this because my feelings have stayed unconditional throughout all the crap thats happended with us. in the end i see past all of it, and i know where my heart is. but with him i honestly can't say..       i need advice people? do i try to convince him to give it another chance when i know he is not sure about me? can someones selfishness be so clouding that its made it almost impossible to fall completely inlove?       he IS the most critical person on the planet! but because of me he is really honestly trying to change things around... wheather thats for me in the end or not.       but i miss him so much. i dont know what to do becuase he means so much to me and everyday i miss him more and more and its becoming unbarable.      i always think that atleats if i try i'll gane something to lose. but im worried that i will lose more then i have to gane if i push him...       thank you.

I was brought up to believe that everyone is the same regardless of race, background and upbringing.  My husband is different.  To him everyone different from him is a N----- and he uses the word repeatedly no matter how bad it bothers me.  There really isn't any way of stopping him from using this or changing his attitude.  We've been married for over ten years but what am I supposed to do.  I can't change my attitude either and before all you people tell me to dump him, that's not going to happen either.  Besides this fault, he's a great guy and we get along great.  This is the only thing that we disagree on but this is a huge one.  Neither one of us is budging on this.

20090304132913AAtakQA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What did she mean by this, again?	Me: Last week, was the reason that you and Jane were staring me at the hallway because Jane liked Adam?      Her: No she didn't like Adam. she thought he was cute... but thats it.. lol.      this happened during this one week class thing.      the background information is really complicated. all that is relevant is that they were staring because the friend liked me if she didn't like adam. and me and jane do NOT get along.         SO THE QUESTION IS, DID SHE MEAN:   a) They weren't staring at me because of Adam   b) They were staring because of Adam, but only because they thought he was cute.
20090304131535AAFEv7n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Change man, or change heart?	Okay, so I was with a man a year ago. This man doesn't have a good track record for being faithful to women. Anyway, during the course of our year long relationship, I found out he cheated on me with the mother of his child. This information was revealed to me after we broke up. About a month after we broke up he moved in with his new girlfriend, also the mother of his child. While he was staying with her and driving her car, we would also come see me. Being naive, I thought they were not together and he was just using her car. Well one night I find out that they are living together. I call the baby mom to tell her about her boyfriend. In return she tells me about what was going on while we were together. Now they are no longer together (I think they broke up after he told her he was in love with me). Anyway, I want to believe him and give us another try I am just skeptical that it might not work due to the issues in the pass. This man does say he loves me and wants to be together. How will I know that he's for real and not feeding me the same bullsh*t he fed her?
20090304131707AA4gSs2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have custody so can I give my children to my mother to raise?  Can my ex regain custody?	I got physical and legal custody of my children, but I gave my children to my mother to raise since my ex wife had a problem.  I live in one state and my children live in another state.  So, I go back and forth to see my children twice a weekend a month.  I can't raise my children because I have to work.  So, my children have been living with my mother (their grandmother) for 3 years.      My ex now has her life together and she's taking me back to court to regain custody.  She now has the great job and nice home.  Will she be able to regain custody of our children since I have not done anything to raise my children?  In addition, my ex wife has has been keeping our children the entire summer and holidays.  Do you think she will have a chance of regaining custody?

20090304132711AAplU86	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Once a cheater, always a cheater, right?	Over a year ago I met a guy on a dating site...we spent about a month togeter in a "relationship" as he used to call it. He was married and he was trying to lead double lives.   It was all kinda strange to me so i did a bit of research and found out he was married. I dumped him the same second...and a few months later I accidentaly met his wife and told her all about our affari. She was surprised and very angry. I was mad at hi too.   I registered again 2 days ago and yesterday I got his message. We both have new profiles. My profile is false...but I made it false and I let everyoone know that. But when I got his message i instantly knew it was him. He has very little in his profile, but I know it`s him.   Today, he contacted me at the time he usually gets to work (12 o`clock) just like the first time, but unfortunately i was offline all day.   I`ll keep talking to him, just to see if it is true that some people can get that pathetic. Oh my God!   What should I do people?   Come on, I am a bit conservative when it comes to marriage and what  he did to me and to his wife is just disgusting.

20090304132849AAEwwZI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Very strange disturbing phone call help?	Okay now this all happened yesterday evening when an old friend called me after a year and started telling me all of these strange things. First she carelessly tells me that she has been having sex with random guys that are twice her age( she is fifteen by the way). Then she tells me that she is three months pregnant and threatens to kill me if I tell anyone. What was so weird is she was very serious and angry upon the phone and I didn't know how to respond. She cried for hours and I really didn't know what to say or do because I was amazed at how she just called out of no where, and then unload all of this distress upon me and then curse me out and threaten me all at the same time. Then I hung up because I had to leave and she calls back again later on and said that she lied about being pregnant( she said she said all that to see how I would react), but she told me that her being sexual active with other men was true......       I mean I was pissed off, and she basically is just toying with my mind and being a complete b****!!!      I seriously did not what to say, and I mean we stopped being friends years ago, because she treated me so badly, and it was very hard to trust her, and now it's like she is trying to slide her way back into my life. I don't want to be disrespectful, but at the same time calling back out of the blue and cursing me out, and lying to me is not helping by trying to gain my friendship back. So should I just get out of this situation? I am completely confused here.

20090304142446AANMvwd	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is he really a friend???? or is he fake?	ok well i have this one guy friend, lets call him john for saftey. ok so my friend john and i have been friends for a while like 6 years or so, and now we are both 12 we met when we were around 7 and then we had a great friendship, we always talked and played together, and never left each other out. but that stoped after we got to 5th grade. when we got to 5th grade, thats when john stopped hanging out with me, and totally ignored me. i would talk to him and he would just stand there pretending to listen to me and then when his other friends came by he would just run off with them. Now we are both in 6th grade and he never talks to me or hangs with me, he always blows me off for his other friends, and he never txts me any more, he only sends me forward messages, and that stuff, but he txt's every one else, even my brother, and my brother doesn't like him but john will txt my bro and not me. So i will be talking to him and stuff and then he will not answer me even though i know he heard my question, and when i am talking to him his friend will come over and start talking to him, and john wont talk to me any more, he leaves me out. I have talked to him about this, but he just gets mad and says i do the same thing, when i dont i mean maybe two ppl are talking to me at the same time him and some1 else, ofcourse i will turn my head to talk to them and then back to him so we can talk but he never does that. so i dont get why he would start saying i did things that i dont do. and i told him that he leaves me out and i dont like it, but he doesn't even lister, and he doesnt answer me he just puts the whole blame on me, when i am not blaming him i am just confronting him. I also have another friend named Zack(not real name) who he does this to also, and i know zack doesn't like it either, so me and him always talk about how he leaves us out and stuff, and sometimes john will be talking to us and then his other friends will come and he will just leave us, and then zack and i will be like "what the heck" and then we will start saying why does he always do this and all that stuff, and then john will be like why are you talking about me, and zack and i aren't we are just talking about what happened and the John will get all mad at us and stop talking to us. and zack and i are always thinking about dropping John but it feels like there is a guilt bcuz we will lose a friend, and its not like we can drop him bcuz he is one of those friends that live on your street and become your really good friend. I just dont know what to do because then other days he will hang with us when he has no1 else to talk to or hang out with, and when all our families go out together, thats when he will talk to us and hang around us, but other than that its like we don't even exsist to him... please help me i dont know what to do, is he a fake friend or for real? should i dropp him or keep him?

20090227071807AA0d6rS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Fell for 2 men, married 1 of them but...?	About 7 years ago, I met 2 guys over the internet and became friends. I met A first and met B a few months later, so of course, I fell in love with A first. He was fun a flirty, always make me laugh. Problem was, he wasn't committed enough to come see me or even making it possible. It was too bad, cos I really liked him. I met B, and was instantly attracted to him. He was intelligent, gifted, funny, committed, you name it. I ended up marrying him. First few years, we were happy, but then, we went bankrupt, and now I'm the breadwinner of the family. He refused to work, and insist on building his own business, which I see little hope with. Guy A meanwhile is rather successful now, and I can't help but to feel like I made a bad choice. He recently moved into town and talking about meeting up and just hang out together. B is upset because he's not invited and thinks A is being disrespectful. I can understand that. I don't want to get involved in a scandal, and A made it clear that he's not into married women. B is still insecure about us meeting up, and I think if I insist on going, we're gonna fight. Problem is, I miss A a lot. Am I a bad person?

20090304141656AAlePs2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm confused about what I should do?	I am confused. I met a guy while working a show for work. He's a recently divorced single dad. I've been communicating with him for about three months.  He seems to be everything my husband isn't. Since I met him he sends me nice emails asking about what I'm doing. He tells me about all the activities he takes his sons too. About how he and his wife split and he took custody of the boys. We send email about our children all the time. I can't wait to get back to my PC sometimes to see if he has written to me.      My husband knows something because our daughter showed him a text message from the guy that had some affectionate symbols in it. I really didn't want to stop seeing him so I downplayed it. I've met him for lunch a few times and we sort of made out kissing and hugging the last time. I love the attention and affection that been missing. But, I don't know what the future would be like if my husband found out? I can't decide if I should stop seeing him? My kids love their dad even though he stays upstairs reading at home instead of playing with the them. And he should be down here with them and helping me with housework. I don't know which way to go? If I left my husband would the kids life be hard? Would they hate me? I don't know if my guy friend wants a long term relationship. It seems like he might.

Im now engaged to this guy but I love my ex more,he's all i think about but he has a gf now and I don't wanna hurt people!      What can I do?
20090304135504AAyb4Wx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this ironic/weird or what?	ok so the guy I like has been given a few different code names (yes he has like 4 nicknames), hahah yeah I know stupid, but thing is that, ever since i've started to call him by his code names I see that object or name somewhere. for example, let's say that one of his names is rock..i'll start to see rock related things and hear people say things with the word rock in the sentence like "you're my rock". I notice these kinds of things constantly with all 4 of his code names.       is this a sign that I should make more effort to talk to him? or is it just oddly ironic?      one more thing...a couple of weeks ago I opened up a fortune cookie that read: "what are you waiting for? start moving now!" any signinficance to this? I strongly believe that something is after me, in a good way, to make a better move with this guy.
20090304133135AANoUf8	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you do if you're raising yourself?	It's pretty much like my parents aren't even part of my life. I see em a few hours a day, they never come to my football games, wrestling duals, or anything. They don't WANT to. They don't take concern about what's happening in my life. If you have to practically raise yourself, how do you do it? Just do your best in school, etc?

20090304140127AA5h8al	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Avoid them totally and completely?	Long, but i promise 10pts to  best answer!      So ive came to the conclusion, my in-laws are nuts!   My husband has came to the conclusion to so im not alone!    My FIL was very negative towards my husband and i from the start, way back when we were just dating he told my husband at just three months were not going to last.    His sister and him have also called me things like a s*** and no good for my husband. They always say im the worst thing that has ever happened to him and so on and so forth. I tried for a year and half while my husband and i were just dating and engaged, and now that im married i cant take it anymore. They have totally and completely  disrespected me, and when they found out i was first pregnant,( my husband and i were so happy because i was told their was a possibility of me not having kids at all)  told me i was going to be a terrible mother and i should abort our child!!  They also told me i better grow the f*** up before that baby comes, and have even threatened kidnap our child(like they did to my husband when he was younger).    Now that the time is closer and closer, they still disrespect me, calling my names behind my back, but want to come to the baby shower, and be involved in the babys life!   They have not apologized once, and still say that what they said was because they care about brad, and they are not sorry.    I just don’t see calling me a s***, and telling me to abort my child as being caring!! My husband doesn’t either.    Neither of us want to invite them to the baby shower, they would ruin it.    What do you think of this??   Also were not to excited about having them near the baby just because they would be nothing but rude to me, and criticize what I do as a parent.    Were just thinking about avoiding them totally and completely    What do you think?

My wife wants me to spend quality time with my 12yr daughter from previous marriage every weekend. My daughter talks about stupid things, is just annoying being with her. I feel like I’m paying for making mistake by marrying her mother 13yrs a go. I mean you should enjoy spending with your kid right it should not feelings like a terrible time. However, I have 2 kids with my current wife 3yr adopted daughter and 5yr son and enjoy spending time with them.  I mean is sad that I enjoy my adopted daughter more than biological daughter. I kind understand why enjoy spending time with my son because we do boys things and he is a lot fun. But why my 3yr daughter is more of joy than my 12yr daughter.

20090304134015AADCtbT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why am I not happy? long but need answers?	I had a rough childhood. In fact, I was abused daily phyiscally and emtionally by my parents. When I turned 18  I started dating a man who I am now married to.    My husband was horrible to me in the beginning of our realtionship. He never laid a finger on me but he cheated,lied serveral times to me, left me for a job in a different country for a year and a half while I was pregnant only to return for the birth of our child and then went back for the remaining time and then when he returned he married me but he never asked me flat out and we never had an actual wedding. I treated him like gold and I loved him for than anything even though he did all of this to me. Now its the other way around.      We have 3 children together. He is a great father to them and has never hurt them in any way and I trust him 100% with them.       I am 25 and I had certain things I wanted to do with my life and I havent been able to due to the children. I understand my resposiblites as a parent and I understand the choices I made and I owe up to them. But, I want to have a carrer and my husband doesnt really have much to say about it, and what I want to do, he doesnt support me(police work).      We are going on 7 years and I just feel so drained and stressed being married to him. We dont do anything together whats so ever and he makes no effort to make up things. I do love him but Im not 'in love' anymore I dont think. I think having 3 kids in 7 years really wore me out too on top of all of this.      am I being selfish? I know I should wake up and smell the flowers. I have 3 healthy kids and a husband that is supporting all of us right now but I am just unhappy and maybe its just with myself and my marriage and not my husband in general. am i depressed? could it be because I want something for myself (job) and it just isnt possible at the moment that I am depressed? I am just trying to figure out why I am feeling this way because generally, I am a resonable person and I am very optimistic with life but I feel this isnt working for me.      I have done some counsling for myself and my past with my family so and I havent let that effect my life. im just needing a general direction to start figuring stuff out.
20090304143127AAOrUFt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She just wants to be friends? Whaaaat?	I met this girl online. We talked for a week and then hung out on the weekend. Everything went great. We clicked really well and had alot of fun. When the night was over we spent like an hour in the car fooling around with each other. Nothing really sexual. I gave her a kiss before she left and that was that. On the way home she said she wanted to hang out again. I really wanted to but i didnt let her know that. She then BEGGED me to, so i eventually gave in. We were all over each other even more so than the previous night. Everything was awsome. While driving home she txts me saying how she just "wants to be friends" and "isnt ready for a relationship". She then txted me that "This doesnt mean nothing will happen between us" What went wrong?? She told me she still has feelings for her ex. Could this be the reason why shes acting like this? She wants to hang out this weekend as "friends" I told her I'd think about it. Its now been 2 days since ive talked to her. What should i do?
20090227072409AAnzten	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does this happen?	Alright. I have a little problem. Why is it that when people ask information about sex, they get a hell of a load of people saying "wait til marriage" "wait til marriage".      Do people not understand that they have obviously thought about this but it does bother them. Yeah I know it's your opinion but try giving them more options like saying "When you are ready to take on the responsibilities and consequences of having the worst happen."       I am a religious person but I don't feel that I am going to hell if I have sex before marriage. If in the old days people could get by with beating their wife and drinking all day by just going to church on Sunday, what's the difference. If your arguement is that when you're married you have more stability, that's more of a reason to wait until you're married to have a child, not sex. I would really appreciate other people's opinions on this.       However, Please no answers bitching me out sayig I'm a bad person or anyone trying to shove their beliefs on me. You can say them, but don't "yell" them
20090304142237AAoCAMm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Apparently it's my birthday soon...?	It has been brought to my attention that my birthday is coming.   I want to do something, but I can't think what - I was considering going to a gig or something with my mates or going to a nightclub but then I thought, most of my friends would get absolutely sh*t-faced and I don't want to be having to worry about them waking my family up or anything when we come home.   We'll probably go out that weekend anyway but, I wont be bringing them home.   I'm not having a big party anyway, as its an insignificant birthday.      Should I do something boring like a big sleepover but make it fun and such?   Or, should we just all go out for tea/lunch?   Or both?      I don't know why i'm asking yahoo! answers.

20090304141058AAVk8L2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I talked to him and it still didn't help?	So, I posted a question last night about my relationship which you can view here... was just wanting to know how you knew it was time to end your long term relationship? I have been in a relationship for the past seven years with a good guy. We got together when we were really young. I was 17 and he was 18 to be exact. We have two children together and I just feel like there's something missing. We don't talk to each other at all. We don't even tell each other how our day went. When he leaves there is no "good-bye" or "I love you." It's almost as if we are just roomates. I feel like I'm getting depressed and I have no appetite at all. I don't know what to do. I sometimes think that he wouldn't mind of we ended it but we just stick it out because we have kids and we've been together so long. It's the only thing that we really know. Anyway, back to my question. How did you know it was time to end your relationship? Did affect you physically before you actually did anything about it? Thanks in advance!    Anyway, I talked to him and he just acts like he doesn't care...what do I do?

20090227071440AAVO4aC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How would one define a superficial relationship with one's own dad?	My dad has been threatening a superficial relationship with me if I don't meet several ultimatums he has for me (I don't want to get into the specifics of those).  I feel that he is completely out of line with these demands, and I know I can't comply with most of them (I am a 31 year old adult with a husband and kids, so I'm not under his control as far as being some teenager living in my father's house or anything).  So before I take this matter back to him, I'm wondering how others interpret this threat of a "superficial relationship"...What would this mean to you?  What is he really threatening, in your opinion?  Thanks for any input!
20090304135448AAM1fs3	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it inappropriae to put expensive items on a bridal registry?	I am getting married very soon and my fiance and I have registries at Target and Bed, Bath & Beyond. I wasn't really comfortable with the idea of a registry at first, but then my Mom knocked some sense in to me. My fiance and I have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for our new apartment! We are literally starting fresh. I've made it a point to NOT register for the most expensive brands/items. However, we do have 3 splurges: an ipod dock ($99.99), these amazing sheets ($129.99), and the kitchenaid mixer ($299.00). Besides that, all the items are very reasonably priced. The only reason I picked such luxurious sheets is because they are a larger version of the ones I have now, and my fiance and I both enjoy lounging in bed on our days off. Also, we get a discount on all the items that are not purchased, so we both figured that we might as well put it on there. The Kitchenaid mixer is just a dream of mine :-). I love to cook and I've had my eye on this for a few months. Do you think I should take them off?? I really don't want to come across as greedy. We have about 315 people coming to this wedding so my mom and his mom just told us to put it all on there.      Please tell me what you think. Thanks!

20090304144306AAoVIz0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you deal with your husband's past life?	Is there a support system for those woman who are married to a divorced man, who has children with his ex? I have been living with my common-law husband, FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. He is the first man in my life I decided was worth settling down with, and would consider starting a family - if he haven't already had that yet. He was married before to a money hungry, superficial, non-motherly, non domestic individual, that he has 2 children with. It doesn't mean we don't all get along. lol His children are out of control, absolutely unrealistic about life, only call him when they want money out of him for something. The ex wife has a boyfriend for 10 years, however it doesn't stop her from living off my husband - getting him stuck paying for everything. It is unfair to our life. It was 20 years ago when he married her, and the children are teenagers, and the values that they were raised by, and seem to believe, are against everything me and my husband stand for. Unfortunately I have no say in anything, I came to his life at a later point. I have no children on my own, have a degree in education though. It is obvious that his ex and his children use him for whatever they can. I hate being in this situation. When it comes to the two of us, we are perfect for each other, I and have absolutely no other conflict - except for this past life of his. It drives me absolutely nuts, because I cannot understand why he decidedthis kind of woman to be the mother of his children, while they share nothing in common? Am I nuts? I try to block it all out, and from time to time it just comes up, because this is the only thing interfearing with our life. I need help. If I could do it all over, I would probably wanna be an ex wife - they seem to get it all. Boyfriend, children, and an ex to pay their way through life while they are making another woman's and their ex husband's hard.

When a woman tickles,it tickles so bad,I don't know if its because their fingers are longer and thinner,they also do it in a faster and more effective way,like the way they use their fingers that that scratchy way that makes it feel like you're being tickled by four hands instead of two(for lack of a better way to explain it) whereas guys are somewhat clumsy at it,and and don't really get the best out of you with it

I'm only 15 but I have killing cramps through my entire period cycle. I cry but my mother tells me to suck it up, I get lower back cramps, and sometimes my thigh-ish area starts to hurt. Iberprofen*, Tylenol, Advil, nothing works for me. If so, at the most an hour. I haven't tried heating pads or anything, but from what I hear, It doessn't seem to help that much. I've heard that Birth Control helps with a lot of people but my father won't let me take it, because he thinks I'll start having sex or something. But if you have any advise or know whats wrong with me, please answer!!   Tank you so much!!
20090304134700AAdVGP4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Where is a small, inexpensive place to get married in the bay area (Northern CA)?	My fiance and I aren't the type of people to care about having a massive, expensive wedding.  For example he didn't even really propose to me, from the beginning we knew we were going to get married and just talked about it together, we're not very traditional I guess you could say.  We have a trip planned to Petaluma and around by San Francisco and we just decided that it would be nice to get married there.  It was going to be right by where we live, we're in Southern CA and we were going to do it at Crystal Cove about 5 min away, but we're always around the beach and wanted something different. So we were thinking about going to get married at Sonoma City Hall but it's a huge area and we only have about 20, 30 most, people coming.  Does anyone know of an outdoor area or even a pretty city hall or something like that, that would be nice? Thank you!

I live in Albany, Georgia and am currently engaged to a soldier in Iraq who comes home in June.  After that he is getting out of the Army and we are going to remain in the same town because he knows I cannot move and be away from my family.       However, my ex-husband has decided he wants to take me back to Court if I get remarried this year like I had hopes of doing.

20090304142259AA2hNtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In a quandary not been in a relationship for along time?	I've known a man for 18 months we met fairly regularly and text and speak on the phone at least 4 or 5 days a week. We've both had bad relationships in the past. We have both said that we love being with each other and when we are together we do get on really well, my problem is I'm not sure were this is going and I know that maybe I should ask but I fear that if I do this I will be rejected. He sent me a text towards the end of October asking me if I loved him, unfortunately I replied with what sort of a question is that, I don't think that it's appropriate to ask something like that by text, since then we seem to just skirt round things. He does tell me that he misses me when Im not with him and I do him, he asked me if I think about him when we are not together to which I admitted that I did and he said he was glad to here it.       What I am think though is if I have to ask then it's going nowhere

I have problems of holding on to bad thoughts for long periods of times, i just need this one to leave me alone.    Heres my issue: I used to work at a Gym and I worked M-F tell midnight every night. Remember I have an amazing boyfriend which I WILL NEVER LEAVE. I had a mal work partner I worked with every night. I never thought about it until one day someone told me I was flirting. Man did that stab me in the heart. I was never sexually attractive to him never. But I did have fun with him and all we talked about was our bf's/gf's. He was into everything my lover likes so it was easy to talk to him. I quit my job because I never saw my boyfriend enough and I thought I did something really bad by flirting. It really is killing me. I drive by my old work everyday to go to college and it just makes me think of the past. I told my boyfriend and he was like it was just harmless fun. Why is it that he can forgive me but i cant forgive myself?...It makes it worse because im always afraid im going to see him at school or somewhere and i don't want to...i wish i never flirted it makes me sick because i think of him and i should only be thinking of one man. whom is the man i love. please help i cant LIVE like this forever.. i need self closer.
20090304133450AAoXDeX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can I do to make my husband come home?	I've been married for three years. My husband and I got in a bad fight Monday (he was drinking) and I told him to leave for the night. We have a 26 month-old little boy and I didn't want my husband around him. So Tuesday my husband came home to talk. I think he needs to stop drinking, his dad is an alcoholic and I don't want him to end up like that. He doesn't think that's a problem. When I asked if he wanted to be married to me anymore he said "I don't know." Then he said he wasn't home to stay, just to pick up some things. The problem is I love him so much! I do not want this to be the end of our marriage!!! What can I do to convince him to come home??

20090304134029AAI2Dfo	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother doesn't believe in me. What do i do?	I try to pretend like i don't care what she says.. but the truth is.. why do i? why do i want to be praised by my mother and be accepted? what can i do to forget about the negative things she has to say about me without it affecting me psychologically? I can really sing. I sing r&b and gospel. my mother is Hispanic to she listens to other types of music not giving r&b or gospel a chance. Everytime i sing she tells me to shut up because i sound like a dog... and that i can't sing for nothing. I would have believed her if i wouldnt have done talent shows and gospel shows and people have come to me afterwards telling me i can really sing. Or my bestfriends telling me i could sing. the point is... i told my mom i was going to be a star some day because I am talented. I can also act. She tells me i'll never amount to a star because i'm trash.... and everytime i say i'll be on the Red carpet someday she laughs... and makes fun of me. Since a little girl she really had me messed up.. and i thought of myself as a loser.. but im 21 now and i know that when i have a daughter i wont mess her up psychologically like she messed me up.... and i know that one day i'll be a star,,,

I don't know enough about my father and I have not seen him scince I was 8 months old (so I cant remember him). His name is: Amuia Nonu he is from Apia in Samoa. He comes from a huge family. He worked in the Nelson Hospital as an orderly where he met my mother in 1972. I am unsure as to where he is living now but he could have gone back to Samoa to live. Unfortuneatly my mother died in 2006 and I desperatly need to know not only for myself but for my children also so that they know where their roots are. I was born in August of 1973 in the Nelson Hospital. My mothers name was Yvonne Patricia Nonu (nee Hooper) She was one of three children and her father was a minister. IF anyone out there could help me please dont hesitiate to email me at honey_girl992000@yahoo,com       Thank you
20090304135020AAeroh8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband's ex getting too involved?	My husband and I have a blended family. Everything is great, all of the children get along well, and he has a great cordial relationship with his ex. The problem is she gets a little too nice. She drags him into her personal life. When we got stuck in that, we said never again. Now she added both of us onto her facebook page.. and i was like ok whatever thats fine. But now she is seeking all of his family and conversing with them, and only conversing with my husband. For example, she talks to him about the beer he makes and how cool he is. However the last straw was when she contacted his cousin, and tried to create a conversation.. and then she mentioned even though she is divorced she is still has his last name.. like she is still part of the family. I finally wrote to her.. said that we (my husband happens to agree with me) are sort of uncomfortable, and there are personal boundaries.(like its ok to be neutral and forgive that person just dont fellowship with that person on a personal level) I did explain that I understand you have to be cordial and talk about children (children first) But she only got mad at me, saying i am being silly and that she thinks i am jealous yadda yadda. I told her i know that kids are first, i am not saying that. But i feel that there needs to be some sort of respect for the other spouse. The other thing is that she divorced my husband because she cheated. The question I have is.. do you think I am being silly about this? am i making a mountain out of moll hills, or do i have a legitimate concern to protect my family. I know that I cannot control what she does, but regardless.. are my feelings legit?

20090304140116AAPAMXE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need help going over this obstacle.?	My parents have been divorced for awhile now. I've lived with my mom most of the time and lived with my dad for a couple of months until my mom forced me to go home, threatening my father that she'll get the cops involved. I listened to her. Now, my mother moved in with another man and my father's girlfriend is pregnant. I want to go live with my dad, but I'm afraid.  My father loves me, I know that but living with him I'm constantly afraid. At times, he makes a lot of money and at times he has no money at all. How can i live with someone that doesn't have a steady income? I can't keep thinking about money and what would happen if we couldn't pay the bills. Also, will i like his girlfriend? After having the baby will my father still pay attention to me? If i move in with my dad, i know my mom would not let me back in with her. If i tell her my decision, she would be really angry, i don't know what she will do(shes really violent and short-tempered). living with my mom is the total opposite. I feel secure, i don't have to worry about things like that, but i don't like her boyfriend, he tries to act nice to me, but i know he doesn't like me. When im with my mom, i can't come to trust her, i love her but she's always yelling and throwing things, its annoying. She gives me no motivation, freedom, or respect.  i can't live with someone like that. what should i do?
20090304140151AAwLa9c	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend is hotter than me and i think i might like him?	I have a best friend who is really hot. I began being friends with him a  few years ago and i started to like him. Unfortunately he didn't like me back as he was 'straight'.  Recently it turns out he is confused about his sexuality and often flirts with gay guys but sticks to his theory his straight. When i introduce him to a new group of people many of them begin to fancy him and talk about how gorgeous he is.       I think i may be jealous of him or still like him. I'm not sure which and it's stressful to think about it all the time. When people say 'He is sooo hot'  it gets on my nerves because i wish they would say that about me and i want to be fancied by everyone too.      It is quite annoying and I dont want to be just another one of those people that fancy him because Id hate to be merged between the crowd.   I dont know what to do.

20090304140812AAJVB8Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i still try to go after my gf and work it out or let it go?	I've been with her for 7 months now, on & off. Every time we fight, it always ends on breaking up and getting back after a few days. She doesn't like hanging out with my friends, going to places i think it's romantic because of bad memories, be close and affectionate on public, always insecure about her self and thinking that i have someone else, doesn't want to put me on her myspace, stingy when it comes to her money, thinks about her future and where she wants to be, with or with out me, doesn't give me anything until now even on my b-day and valentines, thinks that spending time and cooking for me should be enough as a gf, and so on and so forth... It's not that everything is negative.. I do love her and we have fun when were alone together, but there's a lot of things I want in a gf that she doesn't have. She thinks i'm immature and i should always change for her. We were planning moving in together after she finishes school on june, but we broke up yesterday and it seemed for real this time. Please advice...

She is blind and thinks everyone should be sorry for her, but I on the other hand know she is using it to her advantage. She has constantly demeaned me,talked bad about me and my family(my fathers recently deceased and until he died him and my mom were nothing but pot heads to her-it took my dad passing away for her to recognize him for the good person he really was)and insists I'm a witch who has black magic on my husband to keep him. She also insists her husband is trying to kill her for an insurance policy that is make believe! Is it me or does she need to be seriously evaluated by a psychiatrist? My husband wants us to get along,and sometimes I feel like I'm giving him an ultimatum which I know is very wrong. She says he will never be happy with me and that its me or her. I say we all have our problems, but a married couple should solve them as just that- a couple! And that's just the tip of the iceberg!!!

There is this guy i know from school, we attend the same small local college and i never see him b/c we have totally different class schedules. but he knows me, and i know him..and we text alot.

But he never calls, and he never mentions hanging out, but sometimes i feel like he's interested but doesn't say anything. ive thrown a few SMALL hints out there, nothing to desperate or obvious that we should hang out, but he never says anything back to those hints, and i don't want to bug him about it. What is his deal? is he just trying to get to know me better and see if he wants to hang out, or what? or should i just give that up.

So i tried to call him to ask what the hell was going on and it turns out he won't answer and these girls are answering the phone and saying all kinds of mean things to me and just talking ****.and mean while i am thinking why they hell is he letting them and telling them to answer the phone?and why do they even care to amswer the phone anyways this is our issues.I have no idea what the hell is going on.and just crushed 4 months pregnant with our baby.And can't get thisguy on the phone.I was pist and sad and feeling so ugly all at the same time.      He finally calls and says all his **** is at this girls house this tramp this toddlers house and he's tired of me kicking him out and bla..bla..bla..I'm like WHAT! I was blown away.I asked him why and what are you doing?why are you doing this.Well as it turns out i didn't find out till later they have been sleeping together for over a month.      then 3 days later i get a phone call from jail.He's currently on perole.(i know i am am idiot right?) I am thinking why are you calling me?call your *****. then i get a hold of him and i am hisarical because i am just so over welmed with everything.to break it down he gets out 3 days later on COD (meaning the perole officer lets him out) then goes right back 2 days later.I am so annoyed! he told me that this time he want to go home with me and he's sorry and he want to fix things bla..bla.. bla.. then later that night i get this phone call from HER and i we talked and she told me all kinds of thing and not to mention she had been texting me nasty picture of her and my man.Now she want to be nice and find out if he had been talking to me and i said yes and we were planning on fixing things.Bla..bla..bla..His sister was going to get his **** and bring it home. so we hang up.      I had agreed to make things work because i am like ok mabey he's going through some kinda phase.I donno.Being nieve and wanting things to work so bad because this is my 2nd baby and i wanted a mom and a dad.So i get this phone call the next day from an unfamiliar # and i pick up.its HIM. He starts going off about how i need to stop calling his lady and telling her lies and how he never spoke to me about anything and how he doesn't want to see me for visits and all kinds of **** and SHE is on the phone the hole time.She set me up and he just believes this and they both call me.I never call her.for what this is none of her buisness.She calls me like a total phyco.And he calls be telling me how he want to come home.I just said ok and hung up.You think then they would leave me alone.      NOPE they keep calling and i just ignored them.then sh called me from her # and i flipped out and hung up.she never called back again.He still keeps trying to call me from jail and i refuse the calls or don't answer.He keeps blowing me up.I don't know what to do.I just feel  so betraid after knowing him my whole like and i never thought he'd ever cheat on me while being pregnant.I don't even know how to feel.I am so confused and depressed.He was infatuated with another woman while i have his child in my belly that he wanted.I am so blown away by all of this he denied me on phone with that ***** on the phone and she ate it up and loved that it made me hurt.I don't know.      How do i deal with this and i am going to find out the sex of the baby on the 16th.and he promised he's be there and that he'd never leave me and when things get better we are gonna get married and i just never thought he'd do this now.WHILE IM PREGNANT! how could he.I am at my lowest and feel so ugly and fat and insecure.I never want him to see my body again.      But when he gets out what is gonna happen when we run in to eachothe

20090304143618AA7oZzR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I talk to my ex-friend?	My best friend stopped talking to me a while ago and didn't tell me why. He just started acting annoyed when I was there and became bitchy. Since I'm not the type who takes kindly to treatment like that, I cursed him out and he does the same. I never got to know why he was mad in the first place until a while ago, when another friend of mine (who also happens to be HIS friend) tells me he's mad because I forced him to say something he didn't want to say.   I'm sure that such a thing never happened.   But I'm mad at him as well because he didn't tell me why he was mad at me face-to-face, he is mad for something I didn't do and also being incredibly retarded.   Again he was close to me...   His birthday is coming next week, should I talk to him or not?

I'm talking about friends as in guys/girls that you hang out with, that you know so well to the point that they can literally just walk over your house and chat anytime...      Let's say you meet a person today, how long will it take you to reach that level of friendship?      School for example, if you transfered as a new student, how many weeks/months/years will you have a circle of friends that are like that?

(guys prefered)?	ok so i talked to this guy about 5 months ago and we were very interested in each other, we were "talking" for about 3 months and that was ok with me that we were going slow.... well one night his parents were out of town and i was suppose to go over and be with him ;)   well i called and no answer, i txted and still no answer so i turned around and went home, i didnt hear from him all weekend and he didnt show up on monday to school...   the next day he came to school with a cast, he asked to be excused and he txted me apoligizing about his actions lately....   3 weeks later he had a new girl friend, but the funny thing about is that he was still messin around with me, i tried to avoid the situation he was tryin to make. At first i thought that maybe it was hard for him to realize he was in a relationship but then it never stopped. he still messes with me, flirts with me, gives me complaments, and is always willing to help out... im confused, What is going through his mind? does he miss me or does he always want a rebound girl?

20090304145206AAauXzv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please advice on relationship from mature people who can help me out!!!?	she started dating someone off and on for 4 years. finally she met me and started dating june 13. idk what we were thinking but we talked about having a baby immediately.   so we had sex and tried getting pregnant. a month later july 27 she found out she was pregnant. she told me she was shocked because she had a miscarriage october of 07, and thought she just cudnmt have a baby at all period.   so was this a experiment on me? why me if so? i had to go to school and jen said she wud move with me to support me. up until the week before i left it was cool, then she laid it on me that   she didnt wanna go, and made up excuses that she didnt wanna live with 3 other guys and she wanted to stay near her family. so i almost didnt graduate and finish my dream but i fought through it and graduated. while i was at skool it was   hard to focus because she had my mind screwed up. I would drive home then back then home then back numerous times. when i would drive home she would only see me when she wanted to. i drove 3 and a half hrs, which i didnt wanna do, and she decides she wud take   a nap before seeing me. if i drive home make the commitment to see me. i saw a counselor to help me through the trouble and even got my medicine changed and it helped. i started getting my feelings under control. at school she would talk so nasty and    her mouth was unbelieveable. their was no making my point clear b/c she would come back with some obnoxious comment or remark that really hurt a sensitive guy like me. it took alot out of me and stressed me out.    let me take you back before i left for school. we were at a stop light and i planned on finishing school via online. we were at a red light and she says "im so happy everythings going my way." thats selfish isnt it?   we went to the casino for a night which my mother treated us to a nice accomodated room, if that wasnt enough i wake up and see she had talked to her ex bf for a half hour a couple nights ago   WHICH she forgot to tell me about. i bought into it seeing how they just broke up. i come home to visit a weekend and i see they were texting. obviously i was upset and told her to leave.   instead of trying to make me see differently, she nicely, got up and left and didnt say a word. wouldnt you fight for the one you love.? so i then tell her to quit her job trying to be there for her. i didnt want her workingh   in that type of environment. i told her i would take care of her threw her pregnancy which i did. one night we werrent feeeling the baby, she wanted to wait till the next morning to call the doc but i took it upon my self   to bring her right then and there. even i had to work at 9am the next morning in manlius, a half hour drive. for her birthday i paid over $2,000 in her bills so she would be stress free and we could start a clean slate and she   wouldnt have to worry about not having money, but still to this day im called an asshole and fake. one night before school she told me she wud be over to my house after she went to her friend yo yo's. well was she rly even there? b/c   she never came over and didnt even call to tell me that. so as im skipping around here i forgot to mention i asked her how this decision even came about. she said we decided to get pregnant when we were drunk. i asked her if she regretted it then she said she will never regret   the baby but she wished she wud of gotten to no me a little bit more. we didnt get to no e/o until she got pregnant. i am always very respectful to her parents and they like me. she doesnt give mine the time of day and im a family guy, thats a problem.   she said she doesnt no who my mom is but she isnt gonna kiss her ***, shes 66! have some respect. she was into drugs bad in her day and had problems like got kicked out of the house. i straightened her out a little but she is   very selfish. yeah she does clean the apartment and make me dinner but i work full time and pay the rent, utilities, groceries, and cable phone and internet, something i cant do alone.she keeps talking bout how she cant wait to go out and drink   once the baby comes out. she doesnt wanna go anywhere in public w me but when we fight she goes anywhere with whoever. if i dont spend 24/7 with her she gets very emotional and blames it on me. i have a lil bro i chilled w my whole life and i spent the weekend w him and she says   i never have any time for her anymore she says. we live together hows that possible. i work all day and wanna watch the game, ill b in the living room shell b in the room watching lifetime or some boring program, if she wants   to spend time she can come accompany me in the living room. she is so down on her self whenever i tell her shes beautiful she comes back with she has a double chin and shes fat. i hve doner this and complimented her for 8 months but its gets old   when she doesnt appreciate it. however she thinks is how shell act. its all her her her. she like gangsters and i have turned into be a respectful young man and that must n

20090227071424AAsnYx4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I approach my Bf about his Ex?	Bottom line we agreed to leave our ex's alone. He was in a situation where she messed up his car and pretty much put him out of commission for a few months. And now after all of this he still conversates with her after he said that he left her alone. He says I have nothing to worry about but if I left mine alone then why wont he leave her alone? I found out he was still talking to her while snooping through his phone today. Yes I was wrong for invading his privacy but he lies so much I'd rather see for myself than to ask him for the truth. This isn't the first time I've caught him talking to her. I don't know what to say. How do I approach this? Am being a little overboard? Or should I just leave it alone and trust him when he says that I have nothing to worry about?

20090227072526AAgaMH2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I screw up - please help - I'm new at this.?	I met a guy from the UK months ago here in the US where I live and began a friendship that started as emailing and now we call one another. We talk every couple weeks or so. I seem to do more of the contact lately. He asked for a photo of me since it has been some time since we have seen each other. I sent a one, I asked him to call me when he got it. He texted me saying he got it and we would speak soon. Instead of waiting, I called him. He was off to work and we only spoke for 15 minutes and he said he would call back in 2-3 days. It's been a week.      Prior to this call, a couple of weeks ago, I called (3 times in 2 days and it went to voicemail - I know I'm crazy) he called back that same night and talked for 1 hour.       At the time we met I was married and now that has ended but I haven't told him since I don't want to move on to a romance yet..but like him very much.      Up until this point the contact has been very mutual! Did I blow it, is he playing me, pulling away since I contacted him too much or because he thinks I'm married (but he knew this all along for the past 6 months of friendship)? Every time we talk it's over an hour and he works ALOT.

20090227072526AAT6gBe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This time my wife went to her mother's place without informing me as i have slapped her the 15th time during?	10 years of married life.  My parents told me that she is not loving you.  Hence to test her i sent her a message by mobile that i am going to commit suicide if she does not speak to me [25 days since she spoke with me ]as she knows very well that i suicidal tendencies.  due to depression and still she did not answer my phone. I went near her house and rang, i could hear the ring and she knows it is me but she kept on watching her favourite celebrity movie.  I have insured myself heavily and if i am no more it is all for her.  I have two kids aged 8 and aged 4.  Does this act of my wife means that she has hated me to the core and was rather cool if i die so that she could live a happy life using my insurance claim and watching her favourite celebrity movies.  the kids love me more than her.  Please give me your views. But when i went in home and fell on her feet and cried she started crying and gave me the best dish i could ever have. What does this all mean, i mean i could not understand woman psychology. Basically she is a revenge natured person and silence torture is her best weapon.

I'm talking to a girl, we're getting along great, we're chatting, flirting and having a good time. Then like a swarm of locust, all of her friends come steal her because they need to use the bathroom.      Is this her friends giving their approval/disapproval? She always comes back, seeming a lot more into me.      My other theory is it so hard for a girl to use the toilet that she needs coaching and emotional support?

20090304114515AA73lFf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my dad cheating on my mum?! :(?	well.. i was doing my homework and i asked my dad weather he had a calculator, and he said i could borrow the one on his phone.. he said "but don't look at my texts because that's rude and nothing to do with you."   well being the curious teenager I am, and i'm sure quite of alot of people would of.. I looked at his texts, he must be hiding something i thought.   so yes.. i looked at his texts and he'd being texting someone called    Michelle.. i was very confused because i've never heard of this Michelle person ever. I looked through the texted and it had things about meeting and stuff & what time to go online.   i'd realised over the past couple of weeks my dad panics every time i go near his laptop, and if i'm sat at the table while he's sat across from me he'll make sure i can't see anything.. I looked on his computer the other day and noticed he'd being deleting his browsing history, he'd also made a hotmail account. He's normally on AOL and shares an account with my mum, so it could be possible he's trying to hide something? I also went on his computer today and noticed he had a photo called, Michelle. I opened it up and it had pictures of this pretty blonde, she looked around the age of my dad.    I know I shouldn't be so nosey but there's deffo something fishy going on..   What should I do?   Have a word with my mum or look further into it.   :(
20090227072541AAJXl6L	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would taking the law into my own hands be the right thing to do?	Re - post.      I mean, how can we restructure criminal sentencing effectively. I have often thought that crimes should be sentenced based on the social status of the victim.   For example, I am of a superior class, so if I were murdered then the perpetrator should receive the maximum sentence. If a commoner from the gutter classes is murdered, the sentence could be less, as they are less worthy in society.   If someone robbed me, then as I am wealthier and of better breeding than a worker, the robber will have stolen items of more value than if he had robbed someone with a 'job'. Therefore, his sentence should be greater.   Am I right to believe that my superiority to commoners presupposes a greater significance of my victim-hood in a crime?

20090227072647AAg5kV8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MEN: Why do you show other women pictures of your special someone?	It happened to me twice already.  When I'm getting to know guys who I think is interested in me, they eventually will insert the topic about pictures or ID's then, nonchalantly, show me the pictures of their significant others.  It makes me think that they want me to back off.  Am I right?

20090227073132AA5Ekab	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will this marriage work out?	There is a woman who dumps her boyfriend of 4 years and marries another guy 4 months later. She was deeply in love, more than she can ever know but her ex stalled and stalled to marry her, and she got desperate and didnt want to wait any longer.      So, she gets back with another ex from her past, he immediately proposes and she accepts. When the other guy found out, he begged and begged her to get back with him, he tried to stop the wedding, but she said it was too late.      Now she is married for one year, and this entire year she called her ex once every week or so, she was upset, confused, regretful of her choice, knew she was desperate.   Her husband treats her VERY well, but her heart is still torn after one year, she cant believe her reality is what it is, but she has decided to "make the best of it." SHE WISHES HER EX COULD LOVE HER AS MUCH AS HER HUSBAND DOES, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT SHE IS MARRIED NOW.   If this is how she feels after one year, will this marriage work out and WILL she be happy? Or will this "bad" decision doom this marriage in the longrun?

20090227074036AA1lyd6	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need a lot of help and advice. What do you think?	OK so me and this girl were very close and we cared about each other a lot. We worked together and we were gonna date after I quit my job to avoid awkwardness. We kissed and held each other and we liked each other a lot. But I was stupid. A few months ago, I told her and others at work that I had a brain tumor. It was a lie and they believed me and they caught me the other day lying about it. Everyone at work hate me and wont talk to me and she talked to me to ask for an explanation. When I told her that i lied she was hurt. Now she wont talk to me but I know she cared about me. There must be a way for me to fix this and get her back at least as a friend. Because I love her and I made a mistake. What should I do?
