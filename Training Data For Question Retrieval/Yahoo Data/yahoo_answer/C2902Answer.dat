SIWh4UCyaa	Probably because there is no effect, the nuclear winter scenario is based on the release of most of the U.S. and USSR (old name) weapons being detonated withing a few hours, thousand of bombs. like volcano's material is injected into the stratosphere but compared to a volcano a nuclear weapon puts very little material into the air. Either put material in to the atmosphere for a few months so individual nuclear test would have little global effect. After the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty most tests were conducted underground anyway.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	The nuclear winter theory was not the result of scientific research so much as a scare campaign to try to pressure the governments to disarm.    It's like when kids pull faces and their parents say - if the wind changes, your face is going to get stuck like that.

In a decade, maybe two as the Earth cools down the same "Experts" who are now preaching the fear that "Global Warming" is killing the planet won't be found anywhere.

pqVWrNFtaa	Yes, recycling is totally worth it.. I did an 8 page research paper on it just last semester. The information I found was excellent.. people claim that recycling isn't worth it because of OLD technology.. that made it so it wasn't worth it..   NOW most common recycling plants use lasers to sense the different types of materials, as well as sort them by hand and some other techniques. There have been all kinds of scams by people trying to make money and will say they can dispose of something properly and don't. Now the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has a lot stricter guideliness and do monitor those things. So just because it HAS in the past been a scam it is rare to find them now.     Also recycling has actually become very profitable for cities, that is the cities where people actually participate in the recycling programs. The more and more people recycle.. the more and more profitable it is to have the program and are able to sell them and remake them into other marketable commodities. Think about it.. the more you recycle, the more worthwhile it is for the trucks to be picking up from every house. The people who don't make any effort are the reason a recycling program wouldn't be beneficial financially.   But any effort is beneficial environmentally.       AND RECYCLING ACCOUNTS FOR MORE JOBS THAN FAST FOOD INDUSTRYAND HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WHICH ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST JOB PRODUCERS IN THE COUNTRY!! AND IT IS ALSO HAS HIGH PAY ROLL     Id be more than happy to show you some statistics on them.     Well-run recycling programs cost less to operate than waste collection, landfilling, and incineration.     The more people recycle, the cheaper it gets.    Two years after calling recycling a $40 million drain on the city, New York City leaders realized that a redesigned, efficient recycling system could actually save the city $20 million and they have now signed a 20-year recycling contract.     Recycling helps families save money, especially in communities with pay-as-you-throw programs.     Well-designed programs save money. Communities have many options available to make their programs more cost-effective, including maximizing their recycling rates, implementing pay-as-you-throw programs, and including incentives in waste management contracts that encourage disposal companies to recycle more and dispose of less.     [ANYONE WHO THINGS RECYCLING IS A WASTE OF TIME OR MONEY IS MISINFORMED OR JUST IGNORANT!]|`|6msce8FZaa	Have separate containers to divide items up. Some states do all the work for you.

Your invention might rotate for half a turn or so, then it would be in equalibrium with the other side and it would never turn again by itself.<br>  All power plants that produce electricity have magnets.    There has to be something turning the turbine that the magnets are attached to if any electricity is going to be produced though.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	You do need an external force because you will need an electromagnet to change polarity because once that "north" pole hits that south pole during rotation it will stop. There is no such thing as a perpetual motion machine. What you are describing is a generator or an electric motor. Usually there are coils that will conduct the electricity...hence a generator but usually a gas combustion engine turns the magnet and electricity is produced.  On a larger scale wind turns the turbines or water in a hydro electric plant turns the turbines or steam from a nuclear reactor turns the turbines....get it?<br>  <br>  Allen G:<br>  There are actually Millions of dollars that will be awarded to the first person to make such a device..perpetual motion.  Before it is awarded they take the device put it in a vault set it in motion and come back in a year...that device still needs to be moving as it was the day it was put in there.  That is one of the steps towards getting a patent and the reward for a perpetual motion machine.|`|Yfjh3kBAaa	Ummm...there already are magnetic power plants.  <br>  <br>  That's how generators work...without magnets they are useless.  The key is finding a way to power the generators more efficiently and with less environmental impacts.  Hint* - nuclear power is the best way, research it more and you'll understand.|`|uFQFRdczaa	What you are describing is an electric motor.  It takes electricity to make the motor move, hooking an electric motor up to a generator will never make as much energy as you have to put into the system to make it move.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	It's impossible. Ever heard of a little thing called physics? Or another little thing called conservation of energy?|`|0KmJwYunaa	An electric generator is a magnetic generator, that's why they're called electromagnetic machines.   You can't have one without the other.   A DC generator/motor works on the repulsive force and the commutators reverse the polarity of the electromagnets such that it keeps going in the same direction.   <br>  <br>  What you described with static magnets would just find an equilibrium point and stop.    And no, you still need an external source of energy.   <br>  <br>  Remember that every "North" pole of a magnet has a corresponding "South" pole, the only type of magnetism that will constantly be repulsive is diamagnetism and that would require superconductors.   You need to stay in school.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	well for that to work you would need an electro magnet to keep switching the polarity of the magnets so your using a lot of energy to make some energy

The unwanted sound is called noise. This unwanted sound can damage physiological and psychological health. Noise pollution can cause annoyance and aggression, hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.[3][4][5] Furthermore, stress and hypertension are the leading causes to health problems, whereas tinnitus can lead to forgetfulness, severe depression and at times panic attacks.[4][6]<br>  <br>  Chronic exposure to noise may cause noise-induced hearing loss. Older males exposed to significant occupational noise demonstrate significantly reduced hearing sensitivity than their non-exposed peers, though differences in hearing sensitivity decrease with time and the two groups are indistinguishable by age 79.[7] A comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.[3]<br>  <br>  High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects and exposure to moderately high levels during a single eight hour period causes a statistical rise in blood pressure of five to ten points and an increase in stress[3] and vasoconstriction leading to the increased blood pressure noted above as well as to increased incidence of coronary artery disease.<br>  <br>  Noise pollution is also a cause of annoyance. A 2005 study by Spanish researchers found that in urban areas households are willing to pay approximately four Euros per decibel per year for noise reduction.[8]<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  <br>  Noise can have a detrimental effect on animals by causing stress, increasing risk of mortality by changing the delicate balance in predator/prey detection and avoidance, and by interfering with their use of sounds in communication especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.[9]<br>  <br>  An impact of noise on animal life is the reduction of usable habitat that noisy areas may cause, which in the case of endangered species may be part of the path to extinction. One of the best known cases of damage caused by noise pollution is the death of certain species of beached whales, brought on by the loud sound of military sonar.[10]<br>  <br>  Noise also makes species communicate louder, which is called Lombard vocal response.[11] Scientists and researchers have conducted experiments that show whales' song length is longer when submarine-detectors are on.[12] If creatures don't "speak" loud enough, their voice will be masked by anthropogenic sounds. These unheard voices might be warnings, finding of prey, or preparations of net-bubbling. When one species begins speaking louder, it will mask other species' voice, causing the whole ecosystem to eventually speak louder.<br>  <br>  Zebra finches become less faithful to their partners when exposed to traffic noise. This could alter a population's evolutionary trajectory by selecting traits, sapping resources normally devoted to other activities and thus lead to profound genetic and evolutionary consequences.<br>  <br>  <br>  ______________________________________...|`|N2IJDxwEaa	The most significant health problem caused by noise pollution is hearing loss (see Deafness). Any noise appreciably louder than talking can damage the delicate hair cells in the cochlea, the structure in the inner ear that converts sound waves into auditory nerve signals. The initial damage to the cochlea may be temporary, but with repeated exposure, the damage becomes permanent. Loud noise deafens quickly—extremely loud sounds, such as gunshots at close range, can cause immediate hearing loss. But even sound levels of only 85 decibels will cause some hearing loss after prolonged exposure. Ten million Americans have some hearing loss due partly or wholly to exposure to loud sounds, and 20 million are at risk. In addition to deafness, many people with damaged ears are afflicted with tinnitus, or ringing in the ear|`|uFQFRdczaa	For one, it makes an area feel less natural.

qAFhsdBxaa	I would vote for South Africa. They have a very well established conservation policy and would serve well for study. June is winter in both places. This usually means dry weather on the east coasts and wet weather (mediteranean climate) on the west coasts. South Africa can give you both. The dry weather usually means it is much easier to see wild life because they come to water holes and vegetation is not as thick. Weather is nice (sometimes frost at night) but sunny days with highs in the 60s and 70s.|`|UAMtRFruaa	I would chose South America. Less chance of getting killed.|`|1d2d0fb9a5ef712a04bd7b849e5611a1aa	Well I think it really depends on what kind of animals you plan to do research on.  Those are totally different areas and not to mention huge continents where climates differ.  So, if you are going to decide, first decide on what you want to see and then for sure the weather.  Remember South America is a big continent and you'll get differing climates depending on where you go there.  Having been to both continents-it really is a personal opinion.  There are completely different animals on each one.  Another thing, are you going in a group?  Do you speak any of the languages you'll possibly encounter?

Jwk7Ib2vaa	You have my express permission to use my answer, as long as you pick it as the best one o.~<br>  Just kidding of course. <br>  But getting on with it, animal testing is a very valuable thing. Just like anyone else in the world, pharmaceuticals make mistakes. To the best of their ability, they invent new drugs to solve problems with humans and animals alike. If their calculations or formulas are wrong at first, would you rather test them out on a human, which could be fatal, or an animal. Although theoretically something/someone is still going to die in the aforementioned scenario, humans have rights and privileges that animals do not have, or at least aren't recognized by governments.<br>  Don't get me wrong, do I think that animals shouldn't have rights? No. I do not in any way condone animal cruelty, but if the animal gets harmed in order to make sure that my Tylenol won't kill me, so be it.<br>  I think that animal testing is a necessary evil, I don't like the idea of animals getting hurt at our expense, but there isn't any other logical plan of action for testing out pharmaceuticals and the such...unless we could start using death row inmates :)<br>  Hope this helps!|`|t1zlbOURaa	Most of us wouldn't be alive without animal testing.

However, I also do know that we currently don't have other methods of preliminarily testing medications before they can be put in to human drug studies.  I understand the scientific community's need to use them to ensure the products they're using are not detrimental to us.  The only downside to that (besides the abuse and killing of innocent animals) is that many times, it is impossible to really determine if an animal's reaction to a product will also manifest in humans.  Just look at xylitol.  It has been in products on the market for over 30 years and hasn't been detrimental to humans at all (as far as I know, and I've read a lot of material about it), but if a dog eats something made with xylitol, it will die immediately before you can even try to get it to the vet.|`|FWjuk18Waa	Animal Testing for Human cosmetics is wrong as it inflicts unnecessary suffering on the animals and the results are not wholly compatible with human reactions.<br>  Humans only want cosmetics due to the conditioning from the Media & industry to think that happiness can come in a jar despite the fact that happiness is a feeling so comes from the thoughts the person chooses. <br>  Beauty is much more powerful when it is radiated from within the person.|`|0PlAw3R2aa	Are we talking about testing medicine or make-up?

During the 2nd world war human prisoners were used to test the effects of substances and surgical procedures, a practice that was naturally found abhorrent by most humans.<br>  So who chooses? Perhaps if the same amount of time was spent researching alternative test procedures as is spent actually testing products, animals could be left alone! (But then that kind of research doesn't convert to dollars for the mega-billion dollar drug industry, does it?)|`|30eSQJE0aa	In many cases, animal testing is absolutely necessary.  Think about the food industry.  If you eat meat, you want it to be disease-free, right?  How do scientists develop tests for, say, listeria in catfish, if they can't test ways to detect it?  They would need a lab with catfish and the ability to infect those catfish with the bacteria.<br>  <br>  The good thing is, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) actually monitors these laboratories CLOSELY to make sure they aren't doing anything unnecessary or cruel to the animals.  Sometimes the laboratories are actually partially funded by grants from the FDA, and therefore American tax dollars, because the work they do is directly tied to the health of Americans.|`|hSukwxPwaa	How can testing on animals be good in any way?

I called my city and they confirmed that wax lined boxes should not be added to the recycle bin and instead should be discarded with the trash.    Here's more information    The square boxes used for liquids are called "Aseptics", the most common brand of which is "Tetra Pak". Aseptics are made from complex layers of plastic, metal and paper. The aseptic industry has spent millions in public education on the issue of aseptic recycling, including distribution of classroom guides and posters like "Drink Boxes are as Good on the Outside as They are on the Inside" and "A Day in the Life of a Drink Box". The actual recycling process, unfortunately, is very expensive and awkward, and is therefore only available in a very few places. Coca-Cola maintains a list of aseptic recyclers, call 1-800-888-6488 for information. Because of the difficulties, only an insignificant fraction of aseptic packages are currently recycled.|`|r70zkdHlaa	Normally orange juice cartons are recyclable, but to be sure check around the carton for a symbol like this one: http://www.logicsolution.com/images/recy... .
