They are perfect for indoor and since they don't require much exercise they can live in small apartments. Also they don't have much dander or shedding problems. They do require grooming, but they are beautiful and playfull mine likes to fetch and loves to play. They are a very smart breed and mine were so easy to train to go on pads.  <br>  Another breed is a laberdoodle (labrador/poodle)  I hear they're allergy free. Compact and really cute too.|`|tY14vbrKaa	<a href="http://www.iams.com/iams/breed-information.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.iams.com/iams/breed-informati...</a><br>  <br>  Take that quiz.  It's an EXCELLENT quiz, with results, and links to the breeds that fit your household best!<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Let me know your results!|`|I55JNnvpaa	<a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselector.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>|`|dWK0B5g3aa	I would recommend a Border Terrier.<br>  If you get one from a puppy then you will have no problems with the cats as they will be socialised. They are friendly and will happily cuddle on the sofa but are also very play full.<br>  They aren't big dogs but will also make a good jogging companions.<br>  However, you say that you work and it is not always best to leave a puppy alone for a long lengh of time, so if you choose a Border Terrier then you could get an older one (a year old) from a border terrier rescue or a breeder that has had a puppy returned, it should also accept cats if they are a part of the family but it could take longer. Depending on how long you are gone for, you could consider a dog walker or walking your dog before you leave and also someone checking on the dog during the day.<br>  Because you live in a flat, house training will be harder but apart from that there will be no other problems<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/borderterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/borderterrie...</a>|`|NvTaqSC5aa	In a one bedroom apartment it sounds a little small ; and you already have two cats. it would be kind of cruel to the dog for living in such a small place, and not having room to run around and dogs need to be walked and let outdoors a lot threw out the day so I wouldn't get a dog right now if I we're you and your husband :)|`|qasOb5Jraa	Hi you need to ask yourself first not only a breed that will get on with cats but if the cats will get on with a dog because sometimes it can be the other way around when it comes to not being very friendly. You could try going to your local animal shelter and seeing if they have any dogs that have been in a household with cats already, which would save you teaching a dog to get on with your cats. Yorkshire terriers are a good calm small breed or even a westy? You could even consider a small cross breed if your not fixed on a pedigree.

Get him to someone who will help him leave this world w/ dignity.<br>  <br>  Understand too that he is putting all the other cats at your house at risk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://subali-klm.com/cattery/newstar.html" rel="nofollow">http://subali-klm.com/cattery/newstar.ht...</a>|`|fzaf5t3Caa	this is a very tough situation and a sad one at that. If he seems like he is suffering, the best thing to do is have him put to sleep s he can die peacfully. I know its a sad thing to have to think about but it wouldn't be fair to keep him any longer. Do your best to make him feel comfortable an give him many treats. Good luck and I hope he hangs in there =[|`|QRBi7feQaa	i am so sorry to tell u this but your best bet is to put the animal down i hate saying this being a cat owner myself but he seems to be in pain unless u can get to a vet and get pain meds i put the cat down to keep it from suffering cause it will get much worse|`|VkXQq2y2aa	i agree with the first answerer, just take him to the Humane Society to be put down....poor kitty, your a great person for helping these cats out :]|`|tX40VG9Xaa	if theres no cure, im sorry but hes probably gonna die. if i were you, treat him realllyyy well for the last of his life. but your probably gonna want to put him down if hes getting too sick.<br>  sorry|`|H1imIpMqaa	put it out of its misery|`|L7S24gkEaa	1st - i believe that it is highly contageous ( i could be mistaken ) if this is the case and you have other cats please keep them apart.<br>  <br>  2nd - if there is no cure and it will only get worse, and his quality of life is low ( or if i am right in thinking it is contageous) then it really probably would be best to have him put to sleep .<br>  <br>  (if there is any available treatment and you just cant afford it then give him up to a rescue shelter and let them treat him) dont waste time writting , people take ages to answer mail, look up a phone number for them<br>  im sorry that you are goign through this but always remember that it is what is best for the cat that really matters <br>  best wishes to you and your cat :)|`|d5504f49ed3dccc09579dcc68c3c9d18aa	Please have him put down by any vet that is available to you. Call the ASPCA if you can't afford the vet. <br>  He can and will infect your other cats with this virus. Spare them and you a lot of pain and suffering and have the poor animal put to sleep humanely, as soon as possible. Best of luck with your endeavors to help stray animals. It is unfortunate that there are so many who need our help. They live a hard and uncared for life because their owners didn't take care of them properly. This is how you got so involved. I know, I did the same thing until I just couldn't do it anymore. The answer lies in the teaching of people to take responsibility for their pets. Spay and neuter first of all. Then love and care for them. God bless you.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	You should call the humane society and tell them that you have a cat that is suffering from an illness that cannot be cured, is in a lot of pain and needs to be put to rest. The local SPCA or Animal Control may be able to help, or if you have a vet that would work out some kind of payment plan that might be another idea. I think the Humane Society is going to be the best place to start. Look in your phone book for their number, it may even be an 800 number. Calling them would be much faster and you could explain that it seems to be an urgent situation that cannot wait for someone to answer the mail, as that could take weeks, then who knows how long to get something done about the cat's illness.|`|Kntsw4Hdaa	Sometimes they don't have to be euthanized.  There are some shelters that will take in leukemia-positive cats and try to adopt them.  Do an internet search for no-kill shelters or something like that... call or email them and see what they can do for you.  You can also call your local vet's office, they may euthanize for free.  Also contact your local animal control officers if any.  Hope this helps!
1WmDOPGtaa	If you can't afford a simple tooth extraction, what would you do if your dog got seriously ill?  Keep calling around and see if any of your local vets will let you work out a payment plan.  And start finding a way to put away some money for an emergency.
P8RLUKrbaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  Lucky you. I would personally pick a cavy (guinea pig) as they are lot more tame, are not noctornal & you can grow a very strong bond with cavys. Here are some reasons why :<br>  <br>  - non noctornal<br>  - Happier pets<br>  - Cuter<br>  - Funnier<br>  - Tamer<br>  - Get to love you more<br>  - They live longer<br>  <br>  Guineas are one of the best pets I have ever owned. They are so sweet. But take into account the pros & cons of each pet and write it down which one has more better qualities. Everyone on Y!A will have their personal opinion. Choose wisely as you are making a commitment for its lifetime. Remember to do plenty of research before buying either pet.<br>  <br>  Ava xx|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	It really depends on you. But I would recommend a guinea pig.><br>  <br>  hamsters bite -guinea pigs don't.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs live for 8 years- Hamsters only live for 3or4.<br>  <br>  You can let your guinea pigs have babies- Hamsters eat their babies<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  HAMSTER- If you choose a hamster, they will most likely bite you. They are more of a wild animal than a pet. They don't really like people either.<br>  <br>  GUINEA PIG- Guinea pigs are lovable and will really warm up to you. They enjoy hugs and they also love food. Guinea pigs will respect their owners always and will stay with you for years.<br>  <br>  For more information on guinea pigs then see my 2 sites <a href="http://www.guineapigcarer.piczo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcarer.piczo.com</a> <a href="http://www.guineapigcarer2.piczo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcarer2.piczo.com</a>|`|juyA6HUJaa	If you get a guinea pig they need a very big cage and should be kept in pairs, they need more attention and more money spent on them. If you want a simple pet get a hamster if you have time and money.. research and get guinea pigs|`|br1FB5rraa	Personally I like guinea pigs better. They are bigger and more playful. Plus there is more varieties to choose from|`|bdYDOAOHaa	I've had both hamsters and guinea pigs. As of now I have 2 guinea pigs. I like them more cause you can let them run on the floor without losing them. With a hamster you can lose them. Guineas eat more than hamsters, have to have bigger cage, and have to be in pairs. Some may say that only getting one pig is fine, but i say two is better. My guinea pig seems al lot happier now that she has a buddy. So I'd say go with guinea pigs! They are adorable and come in many varieties and colors and are way loving!|`|Kx3p2GFlaa	You can always decide yourself that... But if you want my opinion, I have had guinea pigs for years now and they are loving, caring, they don't smell and neither do their stools, they don't scratch or bite, and unlike hamsters, LOVE to be picked up and played with! Hamsters on the other hand can be a bit more aggressive... If you love playing with animals I suggest the guinea pig. They just eat fresh veggies, water, and don't take up too much space. They are the ideal pet for you if you don't want to be changing a cage or picking up after it every week. They also do not need to be bathed very often. I have been around them a long time...<br>  I strongly recommend you a guinea pig!<br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Allowed..not aloud. I would recommend a Guinea Pig, even though they are slightly more work. Hamsters usually sleep all day, and are awake all night (nocturnal). If you're constantly wanting to play with a hamster during the day, you can stress him out, therefore causing wet tail (stress induced diarrhea). Hamsters are also more delicate than guinea pigs, and tend to bite more if held incorrectly. Guinea pigs require more care and a lot more space than a hamster. They also require constant amounts of Timothy hay, a large cage (4ft by 2ft would be sufficient for ONE guinea pig), Vitamin C supplements (drops for water and oranges each day), and fresh greens (romaine lettuce, small amounts of kale, parsley, etc...but no cabbage or iceberg lettuce) each day, as well.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	I dont have much experience with guinea pigs but I have a little hamster. I dont know why everyone says they bite because mine never bit me EVER! She is so sweet and friendly. My friend's guinea pig does nothing but sit in a corner so I'd say hamster!
139bcf1997c52bd2204b4f639a9bf88baa	First she is not chemically imbalanced. Unless you have had blood test to find this out. If she has a thyroid, seizure or other issue which can only be identified by having diagnostic blood work run. I doubt that is her problem.<br>  Now to the issue of her being over weight. Find out from your vet how much she should weigh. Then read the suggested feeding guide on your dog food. Feed for what she is supposed to weigh not for what she does weigh.  A set feeding time may be in order as well. Also you should think of treats like candy bars. Any extra calories goes to her daily amount. I do hope this helps. BTW in the source box I listed my dogs feeding. All are at their optimum weight.|`|b51294b275ea3556e31d66e62f7ce701aa	She might have a thyroid gland problem which can cause this type of weight problem, especially older females. This will require a vet visit and blood panel to diagnose. There are meds to help balance the thyroid, just like in humans.  My old girl is on meds and helping along with good diet.<br>  <br>  Until you know for sure you are gambling by reducing food that much when the food is not the real problem.|`|AA10425091	get another one..no need to go through that headache... lety someone spayed you and see how you feel...Youare worse than vick at least they had a fighting chance....You did not give it the opportunity to reproduce....|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	I think all dogs gain weight after being fixed!  Call your vet and ask if they have any suggestions.
2G6b5y8Taa	I have a 7 month old chihuahua bailey she is well feed but she is nothing but skin and bone chihuahuas are hyper dogs(bailey is a minuter she weighs 3 pounds right now) if you feel the Mei Mei is to thin take her to the vet have them check her just to make sure she is healthy its the best thing for you to to for Mei Mei and if shes healthy she will gain weight in do time|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Aww poor pup - I'm glad you rescued her.  Chi's have small bones but really should have some muscle on their body - not fat, but muscle.  It will probably take awhile to get her in shape. <br>  <br>  Have a vet check her out and put on good quality food.  Time and love will help her the most.<br>  <br>  However, I'm concerned about your other dogs - if you cannot handle them, maybe you should not have any dogs.  You should be willing to keep them and train them properly for 15 or so years.  Its not fair to get a cute puppy and then when its making a mess and not trained right, dump it....especially because you have a little Chi now.  What's to say you won't have more behavior problems because of the dog being abused (which is very likely).  What happens if she makes a mess, etc. ???|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Its a disgrace for you to take on this pup and throw your other two away. I hope no one gives up on you in the same manner.|`|KLMWlQ9Raa	Bless that poor child & you; a pox on her previous owner.  If you haven't taken her to the vet, do so & quick.  Parasites may be the cause.  Yes, some Chi's are a little on the lighter side.  I found neutering accomplished wonders for my male when I couldn't get weight on him, especially when my breeding female came into heat.  Poor thing was such a mess.  By the way, if all the dogs get along, why not wk the other two in training & then they may all be happy.  Good luck.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	you should feed her and take her to the vet to make sure she has had all her shots and she is not sick<br>  <br>  you might not be the best pet owner if you are getting rid of your last to dogs, (i don't mean to be rude)!!!!!<br>  <br>  if you really want to keep this dog you should take it to dog obedience classes!!!|`|akBrG1yaaa	shes probably skinny because her other owners didn't feed her. so that's why she is boney.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	In most areas, it is illegal to introduce animals like that, unless you have them penned so they cannot escape into the wild. I am not familiar with Scotland, but the US and Germany have regulations against that.<br>  <br>  Will it work- probably not. They are native to Peru, and Scotland is too cold for them. Also, that is a very small population- if you want to study them, you should get more because some will end up getting eaten by predators (birds or on the ground) or die because they are too stupid (never having been wild) to figure out how to survive.
cqLYkuz8aa	Pig and hog are basically two words that refer to the same thing. Often "pig" is used to refer to younger animals, but not always.<br>  <br>  Some more porcine vocabulary:<br>  Piglet: baby pig<br>  Shoat: baby pig<br>  Boar: intact male<br>  Barrow: castrated male<br>  Gilt: female that has not given birth<br>  Sow: female that has given birth
6t5kQnSFaa	For the first couple weeks I would recommend NOT having him in the room. Not to be cruel, but puppies cry. They get bored, they're scared about being away from home, etc.<br>  <br>  The first couple weeks you'll have to get up maybe once or twice a night to take him out to go to the bathroom, but until he can be taught that it's not ok to cry int he crate, or you're able to make him feel comfortable enough than it will be easiest to sleep at night with him in another room.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	It is personal preference, I enjoy having my dog in her crate in my bedroom and I believe she enjoys it too.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Bedroom, I'd say. ;-]|`|qwD45UBJaa	I would suggest in the bedroom. Being that the puppy is so young, it probably can't "hold it" all night. If it's in the bedroom with you, it can alert you when it needs to be let out. The amount of crying depends on the dog. My puppy loves his crate and never cries when he's in my room. I tried crating him a few nights in our living room, and he couldn't stand being separated from me, and cried ALL night. Bedroom worked out best for us! Good luck!|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	Our labs crate is in the livingroom.  I didnt want him in the bedroom because he would keep me up all night and want to be all over us!|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	In your room. He will be more calm. Make sure he has a blanket/towel, or old shirt with your scent on it inside with him. Good Luck|`|2rwNv5OHaa	They say by having your puppy in a crate in the bedroom at night with you is a great way for your puppy to bond with you, only do this if you plan to always keep the puppy in there as it can cause seperation anxiety to go back and forth between them staying in the room with you to being in a different room. It will also be easier to help you housebreak them because you will be able to know when they have to go outside.|`|XPzWWhUxaa	i would say probably not in the bedroom. when our dog would see us, he would cry and cry...and that's heartbreaking to listen to, not to mention you miss our on a bunch of sleep! <br>  <br>  when our pup did cry, even when he was in living room in the crate, we threw a blanket over the crate..it was literally 'lights out'...crate training was the best thing we ever did for our dog -- he loves that crate and knows that's his spot. good luck!
6d0acd3c679f85beb54b01dfd66db7e9aa	Traditionally, a horse's height is calculated in hands, one hand being equal to four inches. The measurment is taken from the ground level to the highest point on the horse's withers.|`|hRikwc00aa	Four inches.|`|aqGLKCxyaa	it means how tall the horse is. Instead of saying the horse is 5'3" <br>  you say the horse is 16 hands<br>  its about 4 inches. so you take the number of inches the horse is and divide it by 4 and you will get the approximate height in hands. <br>  <br>  im not quite sure about the calculations, so best check on google

9kceDOTraa	Blue Acara is a rather common South American and shouldn't be that hard to locate.  Even those crappy chain stores carry them, so it just might not be something in big demand where you are at.<br>  <br>  One place I can usually find a good deal from time to time,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com</a> go to the trading post, for sale.  At this time of the year, I've seen quite a few people selling in Cali, and not even willing to ship, local pick ups only which could help lower your cost.  Good for you, bad for me in this case as I'm in NJ.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquabid.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquabid.com</a> is another place to find a potential deal as is eBay though I have found eBay drying up of late.<br>  <br>  If you can't find a store locally, your only option may be to buy online and have to pay shipping.  You'll have to do some hunting around, but I can say I have seen them sold in stores.  I don't shop at Petco or Petsmart so I really do not know if they will or will not.  I don't trust these chain companies.  I've seen Petland Discounts and the local Petsmarts in my area in action, half the time I'm the one telling the employees what fish are in their tanks and how to care for them, not to mention the number of sick fish they get all the time because corporate stupidity locks the chain into having to buy from certain suppliers in certain numbers for x amount of years.  Better finding a private seller/breeder or pay the shipping.<br>  <br>  There is a guy local to me that raises sells breeds a large number of SA and CA's and is a sponser as well on the cichlid forums I attend.

bl8co4hUaa	One thing, be the one who feeds her. :)  And talk to her in a gentle voice. If you want her to learn, though, then you must never encourage rough play with your hands or feet; it will confuse her as to what you want or expect.<br>  <br>  In taming my two feral kittens, the one used her claws a lot, so this is how I got her to stop. When I petted her or reached to play with her, and she used claws or teeth, I said firmly but quietly, "Gentle. Be *gentle*," emphasizing that word, and carefully undid my hand. I didn't yank or wrestle with her, or anything else that might encourage her to hang on. Then my hand went away and she got no attention for a few minutes. After repeating this several times, Desiree got the idea that rough play = no more fun and attention, and even now if she gets a little rough and I say, "Gentle," she responds positively and pulls back from being rough.<br>  <br>  Time and patience. Time and patience. lol|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Feed the cat meals at very regular times, such as 7 am and 6 pm every day.  Don't overfeed or underfeed her.  Give her plenty of human attention and give her some yarn balls and other fun cat toys so she can get out her aggressive instincts.  If the cat seems very intent on "Tasting" you, get some bitter apple spray from the pet store and apply it to your hands.  The cat will start to notice that you taste really bitter and will stop tasting you.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi your kitten doesn't hate you she wants to play and kittens playing rough like that they normally do to another kitten.  But you do not want her doing this or she will become aggressive when older.   First of all get her lots of soft squishy toys.  When she goes to bite you push the toy in her face and she will bite it.   Then remove your hand and go away.  Just continue to do this and do not allow her to bite you.   When u try to pet her and she tries to bite push her away and walk away and then try it again later.  She will finally get the drift that you will not pet her when she is being mean.|`|QRBi7feQaa	first off how old is the kitten secondly is she adopted if so she may be part ferrel but basically patience lots of attention lots of cat toys and u may want to get her tested for distemperment it can be deadly if she has if not its a good thing u can also try taking her to animal behaviorist but dont put the cat on any meds without a second opinion please|`|Zw7IVfqeaa	How old is she? She's playful. My kittens are almost a year old and they still do this sometimes. They are just playing. <br>  <br>  There's no much to do about kittens' teeth.

Bt40xzBSaa	they are cute little fuzzy critters that deserve to do what they want! i love raccoons!|`|HULRxii5aa	Unless it is extremely vicious, no animal should be exterminated due to people seeing them as a nuisance or vermin, although in the same sense I would usually see something as cute and fuzzy if it were a domesticated docile creature. Raccoons look pretty cute, but they can carry rabies and other viruses which can harm or be fatal if they come into contact with humans. And they also scavenge out of bins when there is plenty of other food. However I believe this is due to humans extending urban land into the woodlands where raccoons would live, so they don't really know what is food they can and can't eat. On appearance they are cute and fuzzy, however in theory, they could be seen as vermin. But I wouldn't say they should be exterminated.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Cute, can do no wrong.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Raccoons are wild, and deserve to live free without persecution. <br>  <br>  Baby raccoons are very cute and cuddly.  They are also messy, smelly, demanding, curious and mischievous.|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Neither.  They are wildlife and should be treated as such.  They are not pets. They are carriers of diseases such as leptospirosis (a bacteria) and rabies, as well as many parasites, so I try to prevent them from being in my yard and around my house.  Despite that, I certainly don't think they should be exterminated, but I do support hunting/trapping as ethical, moral, inexpensive means to control any wildlife population.  (bring on the thumbs down!)|`|Fe1Z7fpbaa	neither. raccoons are wild animals<br>  they should be left alone and not be interefered with, like all wild animals. <br>  if raccoons are violent to people, it is usually the persons fault for being ignorant, or provoking it in some way.<br>  they are placid animals, but enjoy fun!!! s stay out of their way...or they might decide your hair looks like a nice playground....or you arm...or your fingers look tasty :)<br>  <br>  <br>  thats my views!<br>  <br>  clo<br>  xx|`|hRikwc00aa	Neither - they are wild animals.

f06Sy0dfaa	If you raise a dog with TLC from 8 weeks until they are full grown, they should not harm you even if you cause them pain. This takes lots of training.. for instance. My step dad is a certified cop, he had a german shepard, and trained him in the k9 unit and had him for years until he retired, one day he was inside and pooped on the floor...my step dad had thrown a broom at him and he ran and hid. Although, if people came over and were wrestling or what not, if the dog didn't like it or thought we (the family) was in danger, he was go up to the person and bark 3 times and sit at their feet. Dogs are very loyal pets, and with the right training, any dog can be like this.|`|SxHu7BJCaa	Well from 8 weeks if nothing bad has happened in its past there is a big chance a rottweiler could still become a loving family pet. But if you do inflict pain because it has done something wrong it won't turn on you then and there! If you spank him hard enough though the dog may become hand shy. it not good if a dog is hand shy.  If you are willing to lovingly care or a tough dog like a rottweiler it will become very loyal and it will love you back. And unless the owner is  very cruel to the dog the do will NEVER attack the owner!!!!!|`|0QTCiCf8aa	If you fear that it may be possible that this dog could turn on you then this is not the dog for you, also I don't believe there is a healthy way for us to train a dog to "defend" our family if he has to as there is always room for error and he may need try to defend you when, for example, the mail man comes and that is not what you want. Get a burglary alarm and a gun if you want protection.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I certainly wouldn't try doing what you described. Respect is earned, not given. I own an English Mastiff, Lion of dogs, protector.  I am sure he would die for my family, and his loyalty for me is unending, but I would never test that loyalty or do anything to cause him to lose trust in me.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	If you hit ANY dog, he may turn on you. You created a fear biter. You would be lucky to get away with it at first. Any dog is a loyal dog and would protect your and your family. Treat the dog right, and he will always be loyal. If your looking for guard dogs, rottweiler's are not them.Given by the question, you need education on dogs. Read a book. Geez.|`|hRikwc00aa	It depends on the individual dogs. Most dogs, if well-trained and taught bite inhibition, will only yelp or snap at the most. Some dogs will defend themselves though.<br>  <br>  I agree, if anyone did that and got bitten, they would deserve it.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Rotties actually are not guardian dogs. They are herding dogs. <br>  <br>  Aside from that problem, it all depends on the dog.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	It would depend on the individual Rottie.

Then, from there, a Vet will tell you how to gradually increase the dogs stamina. Age is a factor, as is diet.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	How old is the dog?

Bring plenty of treats and toys for her to play with. If you have a doggy park near by that you can walk to she will know that there is something great at the end of the walk and she will not be able to wait for the next trip. When you get her home after words tell her how good she is and give her a treat.This will give a positive reinforcement. It will not belong and you will not need the treats. If you are not ale to go to a park just change your route. She could be bored taking the same old way each time.See if this will help you.Just remember to make this time an enjoyable time for you and her.

hetZz4c1aa	I would recommend that you try a different vet too.  Be sure to tell the second vet about any meds and prior treatments.  Many kits have upper respiratory infections and some are just more difficult than others to clear up.  It may not be the vets fault, so if you do like your vet perhaps you might like to give them another chance.<br>  <br>  Banfield Veterinarians are associated with PetSmart and I do not recommend their services.  If no other vet was available, I would go because I would never put any of my cats at risk.  Banfield does have a reputation of high prices and pushing products.  That does not mean that they provide inadequate or poor care.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|KILFoc6kaa	I would try to find a different vet.

Cats are just like humans in that they can be very sensitive to allergens in the home.

He says this is normal and will not hurt them to eat. But do make sure the worms you are seeing are just earth worms?|`|MT0gw2hmaa	She might be lacking in proteins and seeking out something her body is craving for. Try to find out what you can replace with such as, bacon or something else, banana's or some sort of healthy fruit. Luck!|`|QLopvWKDaa	the digging is a strong part of a Yorkie's genetic make up- although usually for rodents not worms. I agree ewww...<br>  <br>  If this is only happening when she is out in your yard, you can put in a "doggie sandbox".  In it hide some of her very favorite plastic chew toys and let her dig till her heart content!<br>  <br>  When you see her digging elsewhere in the yard- pick her up, redirect her and place her back in the sandbox to find a wonderful toy instead.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps-good luck|`|0R0uRNuIaa	watch her when she is out side. If she starts to eat the worms she has dug up, scold her and pull her away.

My Toy Fox Terrier has the same worm obsession, but she only eats them if they're a day or two old.  She'll pull out a fresh one, taste it, spit it out, try to roll on it (which we stop), and if she won't eat it and we won't let her roll on it, then she pees on it.  <br>  <br>  She'll only eat them if they're firm and chewy.|`|STLYxP39aa	It sounds like that's just her idea of fun, but if it's really a problem, scold her as she begins digging and NOT AFTER.

What you are seeing in her feces is tapeworm.  You need to take her to your veterinarian along with a stool sample and they will give you some medication (most likely pills) to give to her every day for a week or two.  If you don't treat her tapeworm then she will begin to loose weight (if not already) and will become very ill.  As for eating worms, the worms won't hurt her it's what is in the soil that might.  There could be some road salt or antifreeze or some other harmful thing in the soil that she might ingest or that the worms have ingested that might be transferred to her and cause her stomach to ulcer from irritation.  This will cause internal bleeding and if left untreated, death.  Watch her when she is outside (or take her out on a leash) and when she starts to dig then scold her (no hitting, just a firm NO! and a strong glare).  When she starts to go out side with out digging then praise her with an excited happy voice and give her a favorite toy or treat.|`|Y5ZtHbohaa	fist of all keep your dog in side at most of the time and when she has to poop put her on a leash and pull her back when she tries to eat them. second when you do that and you know she hasn't eaten any worms then check her poop and if there are still worms take her to the vet for a check up. ( a better idea is to take you're Yorkie to the vet even if you don't see any worms just to make sure)... <br>                                    Hope I Helped! :)|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	lol...that's nasty. no, i don't think you can unless you punish her every time you catc her doing it but I'm not sure she'd understand why you're doing it.<br>  different dogs just eat different stuff.

aeonmRR2aa	What I would do:<br>  <br>  Clean the gravel very well with a gravel siphon.<br>  Keep running the tank as normal, but...<br>  <br>  Increase the heater to max.  Above 86F is ideal.<br>  Add 1 Tbsp per gallon of salt (aquarium salt, marine salt, or rock salt.  Not iodized salt or salt with "yellow prussiate of soda").<br>  Add 0.5 mL/gallon hydrogen peroxide.<br>  Run for 2 weeks (to be safe) like this, keeping the tank topped off with water.  The Ich will die.<br>  <br>  Then do a 100% water change, twice (with dechlorinated water), add 0.5mL/gallon of clear household ammonia (not sudsy) and run for another week (or until ammonia and nitrite read 0) before adding new fish.<br>  <br>  This will allow you to re-use the tank without a complete teardown, and it should stay "cycled".<br>  <br>  But if you want to annihilate everything, use 20mL+ peroxide and 1 Tbsp baking soda per gallon, and run for 1 week.  Then the tank will NOT stay cycled, but it will be completely sterilized and much more clean.  The best peroxide to use is food grade or any brand with no stabilizers (such as Walmart), but it's not very important, especially since your tank will not have any fish in it at the time.<br>  <br>  Either way, you don't have to take anything out unless you want to, and there are no dangerous chemical residues.<br>  <br>  <br>  Note that Ich is often spurred by dirty water (too much ammonia or nitrite).  You need a second, small tank to quarantine anything you get from the fish store before putting it in the main tank, to make sure the new things don't have any diseases.  You can also just preemptively treat any new fish with Ich medicine, for example, in the small tank. before putting them in the big one - even if you don't know they have Ich.  Petstores are really bad about having water infested with diseases.<br>  <br>  Be sure you have around 10 gallons per hour of water flow per gallon of aquarium, and there is no stagnant water anywhere in the tank.  And once you restock, do a 30% weekly water change, using a gravel vacuum.
hQQuqyYcaa	1. If the ferret cage doesn't have numerous levels to it, it will work. Some rabbits try jumping down from the levels instead of using ramps and can actually injure themselves.<br>  2. Requirements-Preferably no wire bottom that can cause sore hocks in the rabbit, and be difficult to clean sometimes. The bigger cage the better.<br>  3. Timothy-based pellets..small amount. (alfalfa-based if they are under 6 months old) Constant supply of Timothy hay (again, alfalfa if they are under 6 mo) approx. 1cup of fresh greens/veggies/fruits per day (absolutely no iceberg lettuce or cabbage....find more poisonous foods on rabbit.org)<br>  4. I would highly recommend getting a lionhead from a rescue, shelter, or reputable breeder. Make sure the rabbit gets spayed/neutered, as well. This will prevent ovarian cancer in females (they can get it as early as 3 years of age), and urine spraying in males. Also, have a knowledgeable rabbit veterinarian's number on hand in case of an emergency.<br>  5. DO NOT give the rabbit a bath. They are self-cleaning like a cat. If they get extremely dirty, then it's best to use a wet washcloth to wipe them down. If you get them soaked in a tub of water, they can go into shock.|`|CHayJkV1aa	1. yes it will.<br>  2. small holes, stable, a hutch, leafy greens, litter box<br>  3. pellets, grass, lettuce, carrots, etc<br>  4.There adorable!<br>  5. yes if you start at a young age|`|NvTaqSC5aa	Yes because it would have more room, or you could actually buy something like a ladder if your ferret cage has two levels; so the rabbit could get up there because ferrets like to climb and swing up..and they eat basicly the sames things other rabbits like Alphalfa Hay (Type of hay that has greens) & Vegtables (The combination with the Alphalfa and the vegtables will help it Digest it's food) and Regular rabbit pelets :)<br>  You can try giving him a bath, but if he don't like it, I wouldn't force it too. Most rabbits don't like it but it's an option to give them baths.|`|KLMWlQ9Raa	There is a lot of difference & personally, I would not recommend putting a rabbit into a ferret cage unless it is single level & has all the ramps removed.  Some rabbit cages have shelves, but not often & they are usually quite wide.  Rabbits can break their necks & backs quite easily.  If you are just starting out with the bunnies, ask a lot of questions from the breeder of the rabbit.  By the way, to ferrets, bunnies are prey animals.  Unless you decent it really, really well, the rabbit may pick up on the scent of the ferret & it already knows it's a prey animal just on instinct.  This may not make it comfortable in it's own home.  Just a thought.  Good luck.

MOST IMPORTANT:  Ask yourself a lot of questions!.  Too many people choose a dog for its looks, because someone they know has one that's terrific, because its a status breed (shame on those who spend $1200 for a mixed breed just because everyone else has one!), some even are chosen as weapons!  That's where breeds like Rotties and Pit Bulls get their terrible (and except in rare cases, undeserved) reputations.  A dog that works well for one family would be a disaster for another family.  Consider activity level and need for excercise (breeds like Labs, Vizlas, Border Collies, Aussies and Weimeraners have great temperments but if you don't give them enough exercise they can be very destuctive).  How much hair are you willing to handle?  Double coated breeds like collies, G. Shepherds and Newfies shed lots and they need frequent brushing.  Poodles, bichons, Portugese water dogs need to be clipped as well as brushed frequently and that costs money.  Some dogs are smelly and some are much less so.  Some are easy to train and others more challenging.  Some tend to be more patient with kids and other pets, some much less so.  Some bark at every little sound or get excited very easily, others have calmer temperments.  Some breeds can be trusted to walk off leash (an absolute MUST for me!) and some must always be on leash (many of the terriers, beagles, huskies and greyhounds will see or smell something and take off).  Beagles can go for miles on a scent before they realize they're lost.  Some breeds can't tolerate cold weather, some really suffer in a warm climate.  <br>       A really fun activity is to attend a dog show and walk around looking.  If you have kids, take them along.  Some owners or trainers love to talk about their breeds and can offer a wealth of information about what it's like to live with their breed.<br>       Another resource is the variety of breed rescue groups.  These people know their breeds and could tell you whether a breed might fit your lifestyle.  You might even find your dog there!  I adopt all my dogs and have been very pleased, especially with the Rottie and the Doberman who were adopted at 7 and 3 years of age respectively.<br>      Finally, if you REALLY love dogs, consider your local shelter or pound.  These dogs are generally there because of bad owners, not because they're bad dogs.  Some will be killed just because no one adopts them.|`|ZTXvxEuzaa	I would like to suggest a local rescue. If you will let a dog pick you, you maybe surprise on the bond you will have with your companion. Please remember to do your research before going. You don't want to get a jack russel if you want a calm companion. You can googel the different breeds as well as go to the AKC site. I suggest this to most people I talk with before they adopt. It is very important!|`|5s4IV7RAaa	Hi. You say you have the money for a dog. This suggests you are after a pedigree. Have you thought of going to your local re-homing centre? There are always lots of unwanted dogs looking for loving owners. You would also get to see a different mixture of dogs and maybe just maybe something will take your fancy and not cost you too much either. Give it a thought. We got our 3 year old greyhound from the retired greyhound trust and she was only 2 when we got her. She chose us and it feels like she has always been in our family. She is loving and very gentle. Give the re-homing teams a try. Good luck in your search.|`|SxHu7BJCaa	A mutt would be the most sturdy choice
SbLeCOjZaa	He WILL find a way to get out again. The best thing for you to do is to invest in a crate (indoor). Don't use the crate as punishment, rather as a doggy bedroom. Works great for my pup!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	An Italian Greyhound does not have the right type of coat to stay outside for hours on end.  Did the shelter know you planned to leave him outside all day?  I am surprised they would adopt to you.  Get a crate and keep him inside where he belongs and do the same for your other dog too.|`|pl8PaY3uaa	The dog may not try to escape if u give it plenty of fun things to do, like walk it atleast ounce a day and play outside with it, let it run around, maybe even try some agility or regular training. Otherwise it may get bored and try to find something to do elswhere.|`|rVv5TC4Uaa	I bet hes a jumper. Im not for tying dogs up but a cable/leash system worked good for me when I lived on a busy street way back then.<br>  <br>  A bit more expensive of course would be an invisable fence.<br>  Good deals on Ebay on site below.|`|34uWa9kHaa	Well first off most shelters would not adopt a dog to you knowing you would put it out in the yard all day unsupervised. <br>  <br>  Instead of running away what if the dogs got into a fight? <br>  <br>  You can get a kennel run for in your back yard and put a top on it also.  I bet he can climb.   Put the kennel on concrete so he can't dig out.<br>  <br>  Till then you are gonna have to crate him inside your home.  Or take the dog back.  <br>  <br>  Dogs can be stolen, poisoned left unattended in the backyard.  You certainly would not be approved around this area.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	Crating is ok and you may want to have one available to use if the weather is really nasty.  If you want him to be able to run outside you will have to build a fenced in run, like 8' x 30' or whatever size you can fit.  Patio bricks under the fence will keep him from digging if you don't cement the whole thing.  But based on your statement, he probably jumped the fence.  I had a dog that could jump a 6' fence.  Either put a cover on the run or make it 8' tall.  Also, always provide shade.  If you can put the run next to your garage then you may also be able to add a doggy door into your garage.  Just some ideas.|`|6t5kQnSFaa	Putting your dog up in a kennel is not cruel for the dog. The kennel, if the dog is introduced to it properly, can prove to be a safe haven.<br>  <br>  Obviously leaving him free in the backyard is proving much more cruel if you consider the idea that he could've gotten seriously hurt if someone took him, hit him with a car, if he got attacked by another dog, etc.<br>  <br>  If you feel too horrible about it try leaving the dog in a specific bedroom in the house. That way if he escapes - he escapes into your house and not into the road.|`|RndnLxAJaa	Italian greyhounds should not be kept outside at all, they cannot cope with extremes of temperature. 9 hours is too long for a dog to be left alone, do the responsible thing and return him to the shelter.
mFf8CqAraa	Emotional Security:<br>  One reason why cats knead paws stems from their kittenhood. Kittens must nurse their mother to get life-sustaining milk.<br>  <br>  There's another popular theory that cats knead paws because they might have been weaned from their mother too early, and are acting out the behavior of their "inner kitten". In reality, this probably isn't the answer. After all, have you ever known a cat who didn't knead its paws at one time or another? They can't all have been weaned too early, can they?<br>  <br>  Kneading seems to be more of a comforting action for cats since it mainly takes place during periods of happiness and contentment. <br>  <br>  <br>  Territorial Marking<br>  While kitty generally kneads its paws to make sure its chosen spot is as comfy as possible, there is another reason for this behavior. <br>  <br>  Cats have scent glands located in the pads of their feet near the base of their claws, and each feline produces its own unique scent. While humans don't generally notice this scent, other cats and animals can, so the scent serves as a marker to show where your cat has been. <br>  <br>  When kitty wants to mark out the boundaries of its territory, it will paw and perhaps even run its claws across the item, leaving those signature scratches and a bit of personal eau de feline in the bargain.<br>  <br>  <br>  The next time kitty begins to work those pads before curling up in your lap, realize how special you must be. Not only has she chosen you as the exact spot on the planet where she'd most like be, she's also letting the rest of the animal world know that you belong to her. Now doesn't that make it easier to grin and bear it?|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I've always heard, and it makes sense to me, that the kneading was a way to stimulate milk production when they were kittens.  As adults, it's just something they find comforting, probably from the memory of feeling comfort and contentment when they were with their mothers.  You'll notice they kind of zone out while doing it.  They be happy cats.  :)<br>  <br>  As for the bellies, I've also believed that's the ultimate demonstration of trust by exposing the soft spots.  So never take advantage of it by tickling, teasing, or scaring them when they are on their backs.  You're violating the trust|`|fcriCWQAaa	This kneading is called milk treading because it is what kittens do on either side of the teat to help the milk flow when they are suckling. Cats continue to milk tread in later life at times when they are feeling safe, secure and happy.|`|tatbIu54aa	I don't know for sure but I've heard that they knead when they get taken away from their moms to young.<br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!

hKVOw1Sjaa	Depending on what country you are in and it is a registered dog,the usual age is no less than 18 months but remember this breed has hereditary diseases so you should have clear certificates before even thinking of breeding him esp HD scores.<br>  If he is only a pet and someone wants to use him to have  a litter that IS  your choice but l would wait till 18-24mths as this is a very slow maturing breed and if you want many pups then wait till he is fertile enough to produce them although it is really the female that determines how many pups she will have re the eggs she produces.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	After his health testing is done, he is proven conformationally and tempermentally.<br>  <br>  And after you find a b*tch to offset his faults and match his pedigree in quality.<br>  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, NEVER!|`|6qsocyK3aa	Never, considering you had to ask this question. You are too inexperienced to breed. Breeding should only be done by an experienced, knowledgeable owner that owns pedigree dogs (proven with a valid KC certificate) who have won their breed championships. This proves they are an exemplary example of their breeds. They must have had their DNA and genetics tested for hereditary faults and had their hips and elbows tested.

9kceDOTraa	There are Discus and Victorians and Madagascars which have a higher price tag, and as wel, you can get more then 2 dollars per fry on many Mbuna as well.  But the thing is, it takes time and knowing how to group what species by tank, to isolate a holding female, or to give a large space for a substrate spawner, many things.  Sometimes it just happens out of luck, but you will want to do some research on this before just getting what you need.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nycichlids.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nycichlids.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gcca.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcca.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com</a><br>  <br>  These are the places I spend my time when it comes to selling, but you also may want to get an idea of what is in demand in your area as well.  While I jumped from common Mbuna to Victorians and Madagascars, there isn't a huge demand for that in my area either.   Using a group forum like these help locate potential buyers.  You aren't going to hit a break even point in this project for many months if not years, if you factor how many tanks you'll need for maternity and hospital care, buying your stock and growing them out, the time it takes fry to reach a size you can sell and sex...it's not something I'd expect you to see any progress on making your money back until at least the end of the year at best.<br>  <br>  People aren't going to buy young fry from you early on either because they do not know you and you need to know how to present yourself.  Get caught lying or trying to bs someone about the bloodline of the parents, forget it, you're done for.  Read up and do some beforehand research on what you plan to get and what's in demand in your area.<br>  <br>  You're also better off listening to people that ACTUALLY breed or have bred cichlids as well, since we have been doing this, we know by experience what we are talking about and not giving you information based on what you've read or were told by someone too.  You can make money on this in a short run, but you need to know what people are looking for.  It just takes time really.  Knowing how to sex what you are breeding is a huge key, because people will post, looking for a male this or female that.  If you know how to sex what you are breeding and can say I have 10 female this and 15 male that, you'll get  better responses and get them fast if it's what people are looking for.<br>  <br>  Some places, yeah they like those little South Americans, some like Central Americans, some places you get a mix, it really varies.  Try to find a local group, and that will give you a clue of who's looking for what.<br>  <br>  No I would not start out with Discus simply because there is more money value in them.  Discus are also highly sensative to water needs and require a greater amount of attention and care then by comparison to Mbuna, even Haps and Peacocks.  What you are going to be able to sell is going to depend on where you are and what people are looking for.  You could have the greatest Discus in color and size there is, but if you don't have anyone in your area keeping them or have an interest in them, the only outlet for sales you'll have is selling via like aquabid or eBay.  Research what's in demand in your area, unless you look to sell via shipping and given how this economy is, people aren't shelling out big bucks on fish, even the more valuable ones right now.  I know because I have 2 rare species that are endangered or extinct in their natural habitat and people just aren't buying even though they are worthy species to keep.  It gets rough sometimes finding buyers, and if I weren't in nycichlids and eastcoastcichlids, I'd have overstocked tanks right now.<br>  <br>  Wow what downing on someone that actually breeds African cichlids and someone who's never kept, bred or attempted to breed 1/10th of what I have gets an up?  Gotta love YA's social format.|`|tShDXmgbaa	If you are interested in selling the fish online and learn how to ship them...there is a great site I use that I buy lots of hard to find fish and lots of other stuff and you can do the same there.  The best way to get some cichlids that are htf(hard to find) or rare is get them online at the site listed below. Getting fish from your local petstore wont cut it unless they sell fish hard to find like one of my local stores.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Unless you have racks of tanks for grow out, you're going to make more of a loss once water, electricity, food and time is taken into account than any kind of profit. The most obvious Cichlid to make profit is the Discus, it will also set you back a chunk to buy good quality parent stock to start with and you'll need more than 2 tanks.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to sell to stores. Many stores will point blank refuse home bred fish and many have contracts with wholesalers anyway. Any store that does take your fish will take them for store credit NOT money.<br>  <br>  I would suggest seeking out a local fishkeeping society or club, many will have regular auctions and you may have local breeders nearby already! Through these auctions you can sell your fish, and pick up rarities, without a store pocketing profits you'll never see.<br>  <br>  Smaller fish include Apistogrammas and African Shelldwellers, the trick you need to get with these is raising the fry to adulthood! Especially with delicate fish like Apistos.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	I see everyone here mention Discus. Only thing with Discus is they require a high protein diet. Beefheart is their maine staple which is good if you prepare it yourself. However unless you live in an area with soft tap water then you need an RO filter which is pricey. <br>  <br>  You mentioned $2 a fish then you should get Peacock cichlids since all they need is some aquarium salt and maybe some holey limestone rock for buffering the water. Mbuna cichlids are widely available, however the Peacocks come in a beautiful array of colors and are highly desirable. <br>  <br>  I sell,trade and buy from www.cichlid-forum.com and craigslist.|`|7be3f4155dcd42f2a8721e0033593ea7aa	I would first sart a relationship with a couple of nearby shops. Talk about what you want to do. Ask if they would like to use you as a supplier. Ask them what would be a good fish to breed. Ask what they would pay for each fish and what size/age they need to be before the shop(s) will buy from you.<br>  <br>  Sounds like fun and I wish you the best of luck ^_^|`|ivH8tRtsaa	A Discus Fish is the most expensive cichlid that I know, but they require a little more attention than most fish. If you are experienced enough, which I believe you are, then you should have no problem.
Z2vlRSzpaa	Yes it will be fine using it as hay food. Mixing 2 different types of hay together is such a good idea.<br>  <br>  It will make them as happy as could be! XD|`|SRxUK4Q5aa	I think that hay is harder to clean out of the cage and I reccomend that you use paper bedding instead. The brand I use is the paper bedding from petco. It also controls the odor in my room! I makes for a nice, comfy space for your cavy! GOOD LUCK!|`|CuGT5X6eaa	wont hurt,but it will prolly end up eating it....<br>  <br>  EDIT: well in that case I think it will,but it might not eat the straw,but they might...timothy hay is also a good hay for them....BUT they still need guinea pig food,they cant just eat hay....|`|3sB49YNnaa	Straw of any sort has almost no nutritional value and could be used as bedding (though it isn't very absorbent) but not hay.  All of the grain straws (barley, wheat, rye etc) are cut after the seed head is ripe and most of the nutrients have moved from the leaves into the seeds.<br>  <br>  If by fresh harvest hay you mean grass that has not yet been fully dried, that would count in the greens part of the diet, not the hay part.<br>  <br>  You should be using a fully dried grass hay (not clover or alfalfa/lucerne) for the hay part of the diet.  People on this forum are gaga about Timothy, which is good hay but any species of grass hay except fescue is fine.  Pesonally, we have been feeding Coastal Bermuda hay for about 20 years because that is the cleanest, freshest and generally best quality hay we can get in our area.  With our number of animals, we buy it by the 80 lb 3-wire bale which is also much cheaper than bagged stuff at the pet store.  Many feed stores have a "short" bale that is highly compressed which you could probably find room to store and which would save money if you haven't room to store a full 2 or 3-wire bale.|`|4vrUbRujaa	of course it's ok, but maybe u can give some other like corn, veggie or fruits, well it's not like if they are going die with only straw and hay, but if u are having it as a pet it's fun to give the best to ur pet.
ZYzhBhgJaa	You should check out the puffers. They require a bit a research, some require salt, some don't, they should be kept in a species specific tank. They are so much fun to watch, the wiggle when they come up to the tank like a little dog. They required snails to eat, this helps keep their teeth (yes, teeth) from getting too large, which can be harmful to the fish. For a 20 gallon, I would stick with a dwarf puffer, or a species that stays smaller, and I would only get 2 or 3. If you like Oscars, you like fish with an almost tangible amount of personality, and that is just what puffers are.<br>  If you wanted a community tank, you could get some cory cats, a few tetras & some guppies. I would stick with smaller fish, and fish that don't require a large school for a 20 gallon. <br>  I have tiger barbs, which I love, your could get 6 of those, but I wouldn't put anything else in the tank. <br>  The best thing you could do is go to a couple of petstores and see what catches your eye, then make sure you do research on them before you buy.|`|7guIba8paa	a few neons and then fill the 55 wit cichlids and get the oscar a proper 75

WOvXaGUYaa	Totally depends on where you are getting the dog from. If you are getting it from a shelter or from someone's home, prices would be lower than if you were getting it from a reputable breeder. Be very careful where you buy your dog!!!

ITTvKleGaa	I've been an angelfish breeder for years and have encountered that problem before. I was told it was a fungus infection. I had to take the carbon out of the filter, pump up the oxygen I was giving them, and treat them with an anti-fungal medication. After a couple of days they were acting fine.Make sure you put the carbon back in about 8 days after the treatment. I hope your fish will survive and I wish you luck. I hope this helps.|`|M3pjhIecaa	The only suggestion i've got is the salt they don't always react well to it, having kept Discus and Angels for the past 30 odd years the only thing similar to that was gill flukes which had the fish darting around as if they being aggravated by something. Usual advice do a partial leave of the salts and use a proprietary treatment for the fin rot.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Are you using test strips or test drops? Test strips tend to be inaccurate a lot of the time. It honestly sounds like a water problem but if those numbers are accurate, then I really don't know besides stress or a parasite. The only problem is that parasites don't kill that fast. Other than that, I would have to ask if you are using a water conditioner. I would assume you are if you have had a tank for over a year.<br>  <br>  You should ask at tetra-fish.com/forums

It can be a combination of issues or just one. The most obvious one is overfeeding. Another possibility and a very common one is feeding inappropriate, low-quality food (most dry foods). Third is over-treating.  The fourth would be medical reasons I'm not qualified to discuss but they're rare. Most cats are fat simply because they're fed the wrong food and are fed too much.<br>  <br>  Why is dry food bad? With very few exceptions, dry food is not appropriate food for cats. It's full of carbs/sugar, doesn't provide enough animal-based protein, and is often loaded with grains such as wheat or corn. Cats are obligate carnivores who need to eat a diet high in protein (from meat) and fat and very low in carbs. In addition, dry food leaves cats dehydrated. They do not instinctively drink enough water because they're designed to get it IN their food. This results in concentrated urine which can lead to all sorts of problems. And it DOES NOT CLEAN THE TEETH!  (NOTE:  Any dental benefits it *may* impart are usually outweighed by the negatives.  You should definitely have a dental plan for your kitty, but relying on dry food won't cut it).<br>  <br>  What should cats eat? Cats should eat a species appropriate diet which very much resembles Atkins (Catkins). A raw diet is the very best, so long as it's properly supplemented to meet a cat's nutritional needs. The next best choice is a good quality canned food (or even a commercially prepared raw diet). These foods will have meat listed as the first ingredient, will not contain corn, wheat or soy, may include organ meats, and will not list "meal" or "byproducts." See the What to feed link for suggestions.<br>  <br>  So what should I do?  The solution is to switch the fat cat (and any others in the household as well) to a good quality grainless canned food (or research raw feeding). Because these foods are species appropriate, the cat will lose weight at a safe, slow pace (no more than 1 pound per month). Switching foods needs to occur slowly, and if you're trying to get a kibble junkie to eat canned food, that will happen naturally.<br>  <br>  How much should my cat lose?  If possible, have your vet set a target weight for you.  But if your cat is obviously obese you don't need to do that before getting started.  In fact, if you're feeding dry food currently it's also a good idea to make the switch as soon as possible, even if only a few pounds need to be lost.  You can also consult this chart to get an idea of how overweight kitty might be:  <a href="http://www.placervillevet.com/feline%20body%20condition.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.placervillevet.com/feline%20b...</a>  <br>  <br>  How soon will I see results? Cats need to lose weight slowly at the rate of no more than 1 pound per month, and sometimes less. This is because rapid weight loss may cause hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver) which can be fatal.  So it might not look like it's working for the first few months.  It's very helpful to get a baby scale that displays ounces, but even a regular scale can be useful.  Just weigh yourself with and without the cat.<br>  <br>  Why is this info different from what my vet told me?  Many vets haven't been properly trained in feline nutrition.  They may attend basic small animal classes, but the only cat-specific training they may receive is sponsored by Hills.  Not surprisingly, they are taught to reach for a bag of Hills __/d when a cat presents with a particular problem (k for kidney, d for diabetes, etc.).  I am not a nutritionist but I've gathered this information from people who DO know what they're talking about.  (See links below).<br>  <br>  How much should my cat eat? <br>  This varies. Average cats may eat between 20-30 calories per IDEAL pound per day. Using 25 calories per day for example, an 8 pound cat could eat 200 calories per day. A cat who weighs 20 pounds but should weigh 10 could eat 250 calories per day. You multiply the ideal weight by the calories to arrive at that figure. When working toward weight loss, it's best to start at the lower end of the scale (20).<br>  <br>  How do I find out how many calories are in cat food? See the link "Values in canned food." If it's not listed there, you'll need to do some research or perhaps contact the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  What about supplements for weight loss? The addition of L-Carnitine to a cat's diet may assist with weight loss. 250-500 mg per day can be added to assist with weight loss. It is probably best to start with a lower dosage until you see how your cat reacts.<br>  <br>  That's really all there is to it!  Not only will fat cats lose weight, but it and any others in the home will reap many benefits of eating a species appropriate diet.<br>  <br>  See the links below for detailed information on this topic.|`|EqTh6LRPaa	You should speak to a vet before putting your cat on a diet. What you think to be "Fat" may not really be Overweight. So please speak to your vet before doing this. You vet can tell you what kind of food to use. If your vet does tell you that your cat is overweight the really only way to do it is to feed your cats apart. No other way around it and this can be done but is difficult.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I had the EXACT same situation with my two cats. One is very active and the other is very lazy. I was feeding them both dry food.. big mistake. The lazy one had a big appetite so would constantly eat and not really "burn" the calories, while the other one didn't have a big appetite and would run and run and run. After doing extensive research, I was convinced that wet food was the way to go. It is 100 times healthier than dry food and it resembles a feline diet in the wild. I fed both the same amount of wet food since they're both the same age and breed, and my lazy cat is now looking good and is not fat anymore, while my other cat maintained his weight and they're both happier than ever. I highly recommend Wellness Canned Formula. It's grain-free and has human-grade meat content. Good luck! ?|`|9yJdY4s0aa	I had a cat that was overweight and one that was not for quite a while.  For family health reasons (asthma allergies), we needed to transform our cats from indoor cats to outdoor cats.  Now both cats are in very good shape.  It may not be feasible or desirable for you to make them outdoor cats, but it worked for us.
nDHcSxt2aa	When I brought my Newfoundland puppy home to my two cats, both a year and a half old, they weren't too keen on him either..<br>  <br>  A year on and I wouldn't say that they're the best of buddies but they've certainly gotten a lot better - I would say they at least tolerate him, haha.<br>  <br>  It took a couple of months for my cats to get used to my puppy. My advice to you would be to try to get your cats to see being with your puppy as a positive experience - give your cats a good fussing when you're all together! However make sure you know their limits.. and dont be afraid to tell your puppy off if he gets too rough with them!<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, makes sure you keep an eye on them.. as you know how boistrous puppys can be!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It will take a few weeks so continue to give them a place they can get away from the puppy and don't force them together.|`|MJactYa6aa	Time will tell they will get on or they will not|`|dWK0B5g3aa	The reason for the cats not liking the dog is because it has come along and disturbed the pecking order, so now they have to rearrange the pecking order between everyone/thing in the house.<br>  Introduce the more friendlier calmer cat to the puppy, with it on a lead or in a cage (the puppy) allow the cat to make the first move, then do the same with the other cat.<br>  Cats are sulkers and will generally be moody with a change to their lifestyle, wait another month or so and everything should be ok.<br>  <br>  We have a dog and then got a kitten, the dog raised the kitten, then a year on the cat had kittens, the dog then raised them with the cat. We kept one and so now have two cats, in the summer we got a puppy, it took time but the younger cat and the puppy became friends and play together, however the older cat and the puppy don't really get on, they will be in the same room, but the dog chases the cat.<br>  So it depends on the cats temperament and dogs temperament, though they will tolerate one another in time.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	It will take time. <br>  <br>  We have 5 cats over the age of 5; when we introduced our Golden Retriever puppy, we just made sure that the cats had their typical cat trees for keeping away from a curious pup, and we had to place a few baby gates in certain doorways to prevent the puppy from eating either their cat food or their litterbox 'deposits' (gross, but this stuff is like heaven for dogs).<br>  <br>  In time, most of our cats pretty much ignore the dog, one or two actively seek out the dog as a hot water bottle, and one loves to torment him.

1a8f8ef106f1a8c4e395c0349a1a47ddaa	Yes! Chinchillas need a lot of room. Much larger cages are required for chinchillas than similarly sized rabbits, for example. Most cages designed for chins have at least three levels. Some owners prefer ferret cages which have five or more levels.<br>  <br>  Chins need lots of exercise. It is recommended that they get an hour of out-of-cage playtime once a day. Some people dedicate an entire room as a chin playroom, but that's not practical for everyone. If you are not able to let your chin out for free play, they should have a wheel or exercise saucer. The saucers are much nicer and not as loud as wheels, but sell for $75+. If you get a wheel, it is recommended that you get a metal one, or keep plenty of items for your chin to chew on in the cage; otherwise, they'll chew the wheel.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that chinchilla's can damage their paws from being on grated floors. Most cages for chins have these floors because of their incessant pooping. To help keep their feet healthy, I purchased lizard carpet. It's just really thin carpet sold in pet stores for use in reptilian cages. I put it in areas away from where they pee. Once a day I dump the poop from them into the bottom of the cage, and I take them out and wash them about once a month. A chinchiller (granite slate that keeps the chin cool) is also a must have. Gives them a comfy place to rest and is good on the feet. :)|`|rQlzfHqraa	Sure. Two or three levels or just some shelves at different heights.

Any sort of physical punishment is not going to fix the situation.

They're adult teeth are coming in so they teeth just like babies do. Get them plenty of chew toys.<br>  <br>  Second, have you spoken to a trainer about proper ways to teach him no?<br>  <br>  Puppies live for attention so with my pup we would say "ow!" really loud (like a puppy would squeal in pain) and then ignore him for a bit.

Most likely, your dog is being 'mouthy'.  It's a puppy behavior, I think related to teething, not a hostile one.  Give him some chew toys and back off on the petting.  When you do pet, if he tries to chew on your hand, correct him with a simple 'no'.  If he lets you pet him without nipping, praise him in a bright, happy voice.<br>  <br>  However, if your dog is warning you first, with hostile behavior (growling, backing off), he may be frightened of your giant human hand coming toward him.  This is especially likely if he wasn't socialized with humans enough at his kennel. The remedy: Be very chill with him.  Don't pet him, don't make sudden moves.  Just let him hang out with you.  Occasionally offer treats, but let him take them from your hand -- don't push them at him.  Eventually he'll be ready for a little petting.  Try under his chin or his chest, not on top of the head, which can be scary.  If he's having behavior problems in general, a 'puppy kindergarten' class can be a great help, or other training.  There are good books available, if you want to go DIY.|`|22yL5wbzaa	do not flick his nose.

Your goldfish do not have to be fed daily (though it is better for them). Your fish will be fine for a few days until you get the chance to run to the pet store. I would suggest investing in a container to prevent this from happening again, such as a $2-3 item that snaps securely shut. <br>  <br>  <br>  also very  important do NOT feed the fish any type of bread, crackers or so on they will expand in the fishes stomach and can do serious harm! <br>  <br>  Crunching up the pond balls to feed to the little ones is ok if they are an inch long they are most likly old enough to no longer need high amounts of protein.<br>  <br>  things you can feed them are, peas (peeled and unsalted) romaine lettuce, beet tops and swiss chard. you can feed them it raw or boiled (just make sure it is cooled).

Has your vet run an allergy test to see exactly what foods your dog is allergic too? They do exist and are a hell of a lot better than guessing. Never use human products on a dog. Try some Oxy Med Medicated Rinse until you can get the allergy test run. It helps with itching and will soothe the skin.

They're one of the smartest dogs,  very easy to train, non-shedding :), small and VERY cute.  The issue of the price, they are expensive but if you research you i'm sure you can get a good deal.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	You have to adjust your expectations. Dogs are not toys and they are not cheap either. I got mine at a shelter and I've spent more than 10 times the initial adoption fee on vet bills so far. You might want to get a cat for now...|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Go to your local shelter and let the staff help you choose one.  You will not be able to find a well bred pure breed dog for $300.

PM23RDycaa	1.if its legal to own so many dogs and creat puppy mills then why do cops come and take them this is so cruel why do people do this?<br>  <br>  1a. Its legal because they have kennel licenses from the state OR more likely the USDA. What is illegal is the conditions the animals are kept in and the lack of medical care they receive.  They do it because they care about making money. <br>  <br>  2.is it true 97% of dogs in pet stores are puppy mill dogs? <br>  <br>  2a. More like 98% directly from puppymills and animal brokers like Hunte Corp. The other 2% are from local backyard breeders.<br>  <br>  3.why do people think this is ok? <br>  <br>  3a. Again they people selling these animal are out to make money. They don't CARE about the animals, how long they live if they are REALLY healthy or the people they scam.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Half of the time, the sickies are the people passing laws.  You all should look up the requirements for commercial breeders in different parts of the country.  Half the time, it's the local laws that force them to keep dogs in the conditions people complain about.  So unless you're clear on what the laws are in your area, you shouldn't be "bashing" commercial breeders.  You should be going after your state offcials to make laws that work.|`|JtYNXoRdaa	Puppy mills get away with a disgusting amount of what any other human would call "mistreatment" because the laws are SO lax regarding them.  Do the dogs get some kind of food?  Is there water ANYWHERE?  Do they have some kind of shelter, even if that's just a torn blue tarp over their crate?  Then it's okay.  It's disgusting and it's wrong, but the sad truth is that there are a LOT larger issues out there (according to our government) than needing to worry about some dogs which are, for all intents and purposes, an agricultural crop to puppy mills.<br>  <br>  I haven't visited every single pet store so I don't know the exact percentage, but I would venture to say between 97-100% of stores carry dogs bought from puppy mill breeders.  Don't ever, ever, EVER buy one from any pet store.  Just don't.  And there are LOTS of people that don't think this is okay.  Unfortunately, there are a lot MORE that just aren't aware of the problem and some truly don't give a crap as long as they've got their cutesy Labradoodlepugglechoo.<br>  <br>  What don't you believe in?  The horrific treatment of the animals?  Or are you saying you don't believe that it could be this bad?  It's a very real problem - not exaggerated.  Google "puppy mills" and start your research there.<br>  <br>  Rayven stated it beautifully.  Kudos.|`|iasOicRjaa	It is legal to own as many dogs as you want OUTSIDE city limits PROVIDED that you maintain an appropriate level of care for them. In the eyes of the law dogs are property and property laws are a ***** in this country. The reason people do it is obvious...the almighty dollar trumps everything even decency and common sense.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	because not ALL puppy mills are where they are cramped in little cages with no food,those are the worst ones,but a puppy mill can look just like a responsible breeder...it can be hard to tell the difference sometimes....|`|Re576Xa5aa	Yes puppy mills and BYB's. Really sad, yet I will never care while there are starving children. I have tried to tell people but there is an immense hoard of ignorant people wanting designer dogs.|`|PjUaUSGtaa	Im not sure if it is illegal, but I agree it is incredibly wrong to keep so many dogs in one cage, or to have one dog in a cage its whole life, so when it is set free it cant walk. Its just some sick people out there who are in it for the cashe. Thats why I try to only buy from backyard breeders I know.|`|TYErFAAzaa	Yes the majority of dogs at the pet stores are from puppy mills.  I don't believe in this either.  I don't know why they do this either.
8NSh1D4Maa	If she is spayed and kept indoors, 8-10 years or more is her expected lifespan.  If she is unaltered and not bred regularly, her average lifespan is 4-5 years due to an extremely high rate of reproductive cancer in female pet rabbits.  If there is not bare skin under the clumps of hair that are coming out, your rabbit is only going through a heavy seasonal shed.  If the skin underneath begins to look bare, red, flaky, irritated, etc it is time for a vet visit as she may have a skin condition.|`|T8YURmkgaa	They live for 8-10 years.|`|PTmg0dcYaa	if taken care of properly, a mini rex could live up to 10 yrs.  the balding could be molting due to weather change. if the skin is red , scabbing and irritated, it could be mites.  and if the rabbit is pregnant, they will pull out their hair to nest with.
bdYDOAOHaa	I wouldn't recommend it, but if you have to then do so. Don't let him starve! Rabbit pellets don't have all the stuff that the guinea pig food does. Such as vitamin C and such. But again I will say if you have to then do. It won't kill him, but get him back to his original food as soon as possible!<br>  <br>  Good luck and do what's necessary!

I think it would be better if you had a name that you think not many people have for their dog. Keep on looking and you will come up with a good name.

I hope all is well and that she has a healthy litter.<br>  <br>  Once she is done nursing, please have her spayed.  Not only will you be helping the cat over-population problem, but she will be healthier and happier too.  Unspayed cats are prone to cancer of the reproductive organs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

CuElJwaRaa	no no no <br>  those are HORRIBLE DOG FOOD BRANDS!!!!!! they all contain fillers such as corn, soy and wheat and many toxins, one includes Ethoxyquin which is added as a preservitive but is always labeled as a sodium.<br>  <br>  Canidae<br>  Blue buffaloe<br>  Eagle Pack<br>  Innova<br>  Evo <br>  etc are all great brands including a solid chicken, lamb etc meal with rice!<br>  <br>  horrible brands include,<br>  Purina<br>  Eukanuba<br>  Iams<br>  Science Diet<br>  Puppy/dog Chow<br>  etc.|`|1AdzD6bmaa	Don't change to Science Diet; it used to be a good brand and is still pushed by vets (because they sell it) but it is not the same dog food it used to be.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, Purina is junk.  Your dog's health is directly related to the food he eats and although good quality dog food is more expensive, the savings are realized in less costly vet bills.  <br>  <br>  There was a recent article in Consumer Reports magazine which says basically all dog foods are the same.  THEY ARE WRONG and if you read the article and know anything about dog food, you will know how faulty their testing was.  <br>  <br>  Find a copy of a book called, "Foods Pets Die For" read it and convince your parents to read it too.

It could very well be the food you are feeding them.  It could be something more serious though too so you might want to have them checked out.|`|QAkcfyAhaa	Corn, soy, wheat, and beef, and really bad for dogs.  Dogs are carnivores, and have no business eating grains.  A grain free diet would be the best for both your dogs, and would help them considerably.  Orijen is one. Taste of The Wild is another. Just as good as Orijen,but a little less expensive. I would go with the Pacific Stream formula, as it's the lowest in protein (26%)  It's more expensive to buy, but they eat less since it's more digestible.  My 130lb Presa Canario gets 3 cups a day. You may spend more on food, but you'll spend a LOT less at the vet!|`|Tk51uq33aa	It sounds like your shih tzu probably has an allergy to something.<br>  <br>  It may or may not be her food, but it wouldn't hurt to get her on something a bit more healthy.<br>  <br>  I've worked for a grooming shop/pet supply store for 8 years and have seen a lot of skin issues and a lot of shih tzus.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest Wellness Fish & Sweet Potato.  Fish contains Omega3 oils that can sooth and hydrate the skin.  Also, sometimes wheat allergies can cause yeast odors on the skin and ear infections.  You can get Wellness at PetCo, or check out other brands like Nutro or Pedigree (sensative skin formula).<br>  <br>  Try to switch your dog to a fish-based food, without wheat (it doesn't really matter what brand if your parents are going to make the choice).  Give her a bath and try to dry her completely, either with your own hair-dryer or have her groomed.  This will get rid of the smell temporarily until you get her food figured out.  Also, licking her paws could just be a nerves thing, some dogs do this as a habit, kinda like biting your nails.  Try giving her something else to lick, like a natural shin bone stuffed with peanut butter.<br>  <br>  Good luck with them!|`|kfCxfnPEaa	I'm not a vet or anything, but I have 2 dogs and have tried a lot of different foods.  I have just recently bought Ol' Roy Kibbles, Chunks and Chews.  They LOOOOVE it and are very much more active and seem to be healthier. one of my dogs has allergies and is always really sluggish. but since I got this food, he seems SO much happier and they don't beg for human food as much anymore because they really do enjoy their own food now.  I think a lot of it has to do with it having chewy pieces in it, too.  I mean, I think dogs are human-like and I know that for me, I wouldn't want the same bland crunchy food all the time. This food has a bunch of different foods in it as well so there's always a little variety.
AA10063288	Looks like a cataract. She needs evaluation by a vet before she loses sight in her eye.|`|5A24XhTfaa	Hmm well does she have problems seeing?

DzNyOIZpaa	it may be preginate.
M3pjhIecaa	As has already been stated, for me I started with a temp of 82f, loads of live food to condition the fish, water change of 74f water and then let them get on with it. <br>  You'd need a spawning mop of some kind for any chance of the eggs surviving predation, they'll start flitting backwards and forwards next to each other you may even see the eggs dropping as they do it if its not a pre-run. <br>  To produce infursoria take a glass bottle put water in it and then drop a leaf of lettuce in it, leave it on a window sill where sunlight will get at it and then wait a few days, it will become cloudy and that job done all you need to do is siphon some of the water off and drop it in the tank with the baby's you may not be able to see it but they can. After a couple of days start a second one, if it starts to smell off get rid of it and use the back up and keep rotating until the fry are large enough to take newly hatched brine shrimp.<br>  Not the easiest fish to breed and raise but while its not the holy grail of breeding its one of the more satisfying fish to breed.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	Breeding occurs in the morning after a rainfall. Temperature should be 24-26°C (75-78°F). Water should be soft, 2-6 GH. If you cannot put fish into a separate breeding tank with soft water a 50% water change can sometimes simulate rainfall. Prepare mature fish by feeding them a high protein diet for several days. Afterwards, select a breeding pair or small group and transfer them into the breeding tank. The tank should be prepared with a soft substrate or plants like java moss to allow the eggs to fall through and into. The tank should be kept in full darkness for a period (overnight) and then the light levels should be slowly increased (position the tank by an east facing window).<br>  Spawning should occur during the morning. The eggs are the size of sand and not sticky. The adult tetras will eat the eggs, so remove them after spawning. Cover the tank again to maintain darkness. The eggs and young fry are very light sensitive. After 24-36 hours the eggs should hatch and fry should be swimming in another 4 days. They should be fed infusoria, newly hatched brine shrimp, or fry food. They prefer soft water and are sensitive to water changes, so begin with very small (5-10%) water changes often and move to a sponge filter as soon as they are ready. Once they are large enough to eat micro pellets they can be acclimated to a general tank.
1WmDOPGtaa	I'm sure your dog will do fine, but it definitely won't hurt to start getting him more accustomed to kids.  It's often not that dogs don't like kids, but more that they don't understand them.  Depending on the size of the dog, a child may be right at eye level, which can make the social interaction awkward.  Children tend to move erratically and make high pitched noises when they play, which can really jump start the prey drive in a dog and make them want to chase.  It's just something they need to get experience with and be taught how to properly respond.  <br>  <br>  When introducing your dog to children, make sure you take the time to explain to the child what is and is not acceptable.  For example, pulling ears or tails and picking noses are unacceptable (you would be shocked at what some kids will try to do out of curiosity).  Never, for any reason, leave a child alone with any dog.  It's one of those rules too many people ignore.  Then the child accidentally steps on the dog or surprises it out of a deep sleep and the dog reacts instinctively.  It's not about a lack of trust in your dog (or the child for that matter), it's just taking responsibility and taking control.  Good luck!|`|yQSu7v22aa	It depends on the dog and you will just have to see how things go at the time.  I'm sure your dog will be fine and most dogs will walk away from a child if they don't want to be bothered by them so watch out for this and if the dog walks away make sure the kids leave it be.  I'm a bit the same I have a year old ***** and no children although I do hope to have kids at some point.  I make sure that if a child comes up to us I get her to sit so she's calm for the introductions.  If you decide to have kids down the line you can buy CDs to desensitise the dog to baby noises such as crying, screaming, cooing etc or even cheaper record a friends child.  I'm sure the dog will be fine as long as you are calm and I'm sure there is nothing to worry about.|`|AA10112346	Sounds like he will be fine, watch the hyper mean rough kids though, and dont let them startle him.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	relax,,, your dog will be fine with your children.<br>  <br>  i would not suggest you let strange children "squeeze your dog tightly"

26PPwzrWaa	Well what may have started off as an allergy is really forming into a habit it seems or the allergy has gotten worse due to constant exposure. <br>  <br>  I like canidae foods generally, but for a dog with allergies, you are asking for it. <br>  <br>  Try grain free foods and if she is still going for them after 12 weeks, consider switching her meat base. <br>  For example, you are currently on canidae. Switch to wellness core. After 8 to 12 weeks, if no luck, switch to wellness core Ocean variety. <br>  <br>  I would also ask your dogs vet if you can give her benadryl to help with the current itching.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes the allergies could only affect two feet. Have your vet run an allergy test to see what she's allergic too. She may need a food with a different protein like lamb or venison.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I am going to guess allergy. Dogs can be allergic to things such a furniture polish or dryer sheets that you use when washing their bed. They can be allergic to grass, or grooming products. Allergies to foods is usually corn or grain products , but can be to the protein source such as beef or chicken. You don't mention which Canadae. You should try a completely different food with none of the same things that she is eating. I went from Eukanuba to Solid Gold Barking at the Moon. It is grain free. Mostly because of food allergy I make the food for my dogs, but I can use that, or Innova EVO red meat.Salmon oil may help the itching and dry skin.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Is this something new, or has she done this prior?  We had a dog that would chew all of her feet raw in the spring and fall.  (We are moving into spring with lots of plants budding).  It was definitely allergies but not to food.  We used Gold Bond medicated powder which seemed to help sooth the skin and dry it out at the same time.  Try to keep her feet as dry as possible as moisture can cause fungal infections as well.|`|ayuY5ZX0aa	Its the dog food, I had my dogs on Canidae all life stages, same results that you are going thru,try a different brand gradually you will see the results|`|fOLO4TNhaa	I have had this experience before with one of my fosters. Although i must say it was all her paws, front and back. Also she basically scratched everywhere. It *was* allergies to her food.<br>  <br>  Her food intake you stated above seems very good. I must go with the vet and say maybe she stepped in something. I am not 100% sure on this, just thought id share my experience. Hopefully the vet will get what is really happening and help her. Good luck, hope she gets better!
N70orPJ6aa	Has he been getting the proper hydration? Sometimes if they are dehydrated the urates will harden up and make it harder for them to go. What substrate is he on and what have you been feeding it? Loose substrates are impaction problems which can block his digestive system not letting him defecate and improper foods like pinkies, meal worms, and other foods that are too big can also cause a blockage. <br>  <br>  Give him baths 1-2 times a day for 15-20 minutes each and rub the right side of his belly, chin to vent lightly. If you can't get him to go with the bathing, try getting him to eat some organic (no sugar or other chemicals) applesauce with a couple drops of olive oil or mineral oil. This will lube up his insides and usually helps pass a blockage along. If you still can't get him to go... I think a trip to an experienced reptile vet is in order. Blockages for that long can be fatal, and it's not something to take lightly.
e46d2c3d2a60fbc79b6ad9ededf072abaa	Most of your larger pet stores, like Pets-Mart and Petco, have memorials that can be purchased, and you can have the pets name engraved on it. Some engraving shops, also carry pet memorials.<br>  <br>  Last summer, ROXANNE and I were homeless. We were sleeping in a junk yard at night, where a big pit bull was the yard dog. He watched over us, kept us safe, and woke us in the morning so that the owners of the yard never found us.<br>  He was crushed by a junk car falling on him a month after we found a new home.<br>  When the owner of the yard found us lighting a candle outside the fence, he asked "Why would you light a candle for that mangy mutt?"<br>  I just smiled, and lit the candle.|`|64f1b89b8b1c6fcbafc16a8e26f2eb9eaa	Although you want to make a picture memorial I might also make other suggestions.  If you own a home plant a tree or go to the town and ask if you can plant a memorial tree.  Go to your local dog park and find out if you can donate a bench or equipment in the dogs name so others can enjoy it also.

n0WnEIopaa	YAY MORE STRAYS WITH NO HOMES!!!<br>  <br>  WOOO!!! <br>  <br>  You should spay your cat, there is NO need for more cats in this world, there are shelters full with no homes.<br>  <br>  ** Finding them homes doesn't make it any better, because the homes you are finding them may have adopted from a shelter if you didn't pawn an unvetchecked kitten on them. <br>  <br>  I know some things are beyond your control, but people need to be educated on cat over population, and the causes. <br>  <br>  Uneducated cat owners, like yourself, are the causes for cats in shelters being put to sleep. In a sense, you are killing other kittens, because you didn't get your cat spayed.|`|inST4SlAaa	t depends on how many kittens there are to be born.  my cat just had kittens last week.  she started around 2 n the Morning and by 530 am she was done and had four but t is different for each cat just like it is  different for human births.<br>  <br>  arent they soooo cute?  mne had black and whte ones that look like baby cows|`|sayfQB2aaa	Ok, there can only be 2 but usually there is more, <br>  <br>  i hope your paying attention and have counted how many placentas have come, a retained placenta can cause a life threatening infection.<br>  <br>   Lots of people are judgmental but thats only because they really care about kittens and cats. <br>  <br>  Keep us updated <br>  <br>  and have you counted three placentas. Also after the birth take some photos and upload them if you have time I love seeing cute kitten pics. <br>  <br>  Also most births wouldn't take 24 - 48 hours more likely 6 or something.<br>  <br>  They sound very cute.<br>  <br>  Hope all is still going well|`|kXdXJKEMaa	it take around 24-48 hours to have the whole litter|`|5VxgTspWaa	i agree with hmmmmm|`|RdxNcHeAaa	Awww..so cute...yes, probably there will be more..<br>  oh i want one|`|tDP6ru3oaa	sometimes births are really quick. Like 9 hours, some are longer, 1-2 days. It depends on the cat. She might have more. It depends if this is her first litter or not and how old she is. If it's her 1st litter and she's young then she'll have 2-4. If It's her 2nd litter or up and she's a bit older then she can have up to 7. But again it depends on the cat. Hopefully she has more.

Rrpb5aLMaa	I bet getting her spaded would do a world of good, I mean think about how you feel towards guys when you have a period.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	It could be because she is going into heat as some females do become cranky and more territorial when they come into season. I'd get her spayed as soon as you can. If the aggression is due to her surging hormones then spaying should remedy the situation but if it's because of a behavioral issue, then it won't help much, if at all. Spaying is still a good idea though as dogs with aggression issues shouldn't be bred.<br>  Good luck.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Yes, it could be that. Their hormones change in a similar way to ours. Even though they don't menstruate they can get something that resembles PMT. See how she goes. If she does only show aggression before/during a heat, then spaying will stop it happening again. She probably isn't feeling too great. I will always advocate spaying as it prevents so many health problems and of course unwanted pregnancies.|`|UEy1Ti1Aaa	In short - yes she could be showing aggressive behavior because she is on heat - this quite normal. A ***** can show very eratic behavior when on heat - one minute she could be quite bouncy and then become very withdrawn- and if she is having a bad day can also show aggressive behavior. This will all change once she is through it - I can't guantee that the behavior will disapear after she is spayed because I have not met her or seen her and it may be down to other issues - and it would not be right for me to say. All I can say is that a dog on heat can show aggressive behavior. Speak to your vet.
7Rp256IOaa	There is not difference between the two ways.  On the one hand, if you get the two as puppies you get the potty training and cleaning up done all at once vs. having one, getting over that, then starting all over with another.  As far as bonding goes, this will happen whether you have one or two.  Each of you would have a dog to spend time with.  The one thing you do want to be mindful of is to be sure the two get along together.   It can be hard to tell in puppies but if they get along in the beginning, chances are good they will continue to get along as long as you supervise them properly and train them.  Having a small dog and a big dog can be a challenge to make sure the larger dog doesn't become too rough in play with the smaller dog.  You will have to supervise them pretty carefully as they grow up and not let them alone together in case play gets to be a bit much.<br>  Consider adopting from a local shelter too.  An older dog can be easier to manage and they have just as much love to give if not more.  You might find two dogs that are great together right from the start.  (two males or two females getting into fights can be much more intense than male/female fights if one does break out)|`|VdeV0jUqaa	I think its a good idea to get them at the same time.<br>  Puppies require alot of time and attention- and having two- they will be able to play together and be friends from a very young age.<br>  With young dogs its probably not as big of an issue to get them seperately, as they are not sexually mature yet and it is unlikely they would develop serious territorial problems. <br>  You should both be planning on getting your dogs desexed in the future, though.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Getting two puppies at the same time can be a REALLY bad idea unless you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.showdog.com/login/philboard_read.aspx?id=187153" rel="nofollow">http://www.showdog.com/login/philboard_r...</a>|`|FdcWPp48aa	It would be better to not get two puppies at the same time.  It would also be better to get opposite sexes.  It would be better if they are neutered.  Many dogs get along with same sex, but is better if they are neutered young and that helps with the territory and marking problems.
gjD8pndjaa	It is simply a registry.  Records bloodlines and pedigrees.<br>  <br>  It is also an organization that sponsors purebred activities such as shows and trials.<br>  <br>  You do not have to register a dog, but it is generally recommended and something that a reputable breeder will do for you anyways.|`|26PPwzrWaa	AKC is a registry. <br>  <br>  Although that doesnt mean every AKC dog is great. <br>  <br>  A purebred dog that is AKC is not the stamp of quality. <br>  Research and make sure you are getting a good quality dog over one with just a stamp of "approval". Even some of those petstore dogs are registered with AKC. <br>  <br>  Start with the breeds club of america for breeders or referrals from those that own that breed and the ask tons of questions to that breeder. Expect to be searched too. If you are not questioned and all they state is the price, run. <br>  <br>  Another thing, make sure you agree to that contract. If you dont want to spay/neuter until 24 months make that clear before signing a new updated contract. Do not sign something with an agreement on something you do Not agree with. Kind of like rojon danes states you should just walk on by if you plan to do uncoventional feeding/vet care such as raw feeding, no vaccinations, etc.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	The AKC is a registration service.  If your dog is purebred and you want to breed or show, in the US, the only two reputable registries are AKC and UKC.  If a dog is not eligible to be registered by either of these organizations, then it's Purebred heritage is suspect and usually the product of a BYB or a puppy mill.  There is no law that says that pure bred dogs have to be registered with them, but all reputable breeders use either AKC or the UKC.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Its a registration service.. its there to keep track of pedigrees and to verify parentage of the dog.  AKC also holds dogs shows and events so that people can proove that their dogs meet breed standards.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	The AKC keeps track of pedigrees of purebred dogs. They are a registry.

6t5kQnSFaa	Does he have constant access to a water supply like a water bowl or the toilet?<br>  <br>  At least until he gets used to going outside you may want to restrict when he drinks (we give our pup water at the same time he eats).<br>  <br>  They also make potty pads that smell like ammonia and pheromones to urge the puppy to go on the pad. We never used them, but have heard good things about them. They're not necessarily meant to be a forever thing, but a good thing for the time being.<br>  <br>  Also, what we do is when the pup starts going tot he bathroom outside say in a loud enough voice (but not loud enough to startle the dog) "Go potty" (or whatever command you'd like to use) and give the pup a treat followed by a "good potty."<br>  <br>  It teaches them where to go and what's good.|`|ZTZBItU0aa	Crate training. First, you should have your pound-puppy examined and vetted by a vet. If he is clear of any urinary problems, you could use a crate.<br>  There's too much info to put into one answer, so you could read about crate training, but during the night he should be kept in a crate. Immediately being taken out of it, take him straight outside to "potty". Use a key word EVERY TIME he should go and does go. Praise him when he does a "good potty" outside. If he's going 10 min's after bringing him inside, be sure to walk around outside for a few and see if he goes again before bringing him back in. Let him go until he can't go anymore.<br>  Crate him when you aren't watching him. Crate him when you leave. If you catch him peeing in the house, yell a sturn "NO!", make it sharp to catch his attention, and pick him up and take him out.<br>  But do some reading on this. There's no reason to get frustrated when there are so much material available to read and learn from.|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	1.Ok so at night you should be crate training (or anytime you are not at home) <br>  <br>  2. Feed him twice a day at the same time (he will need to go 10 to 30 minutes after eating)<br>  <br>  3. Keep him on a leash attached to your hip when ever you are home.(pain I know but you only have to do it for a week or so)<br>  <br>  4. Know the signs( When a dog circles, sniffs the floor, or trys to get away from you they need to go potty)<br>  <br>  5. If it continues then take him to a vet he could have a urinary tract infection or something along those lines.<br>  <br>  6. Give him a treat and tell him he is a good boy everytime he goes outside.<br>  <br>  <br>  Give it a try and if it doesnt work just contact me and I can give you more tips. Good luck.|`|UEy1Ti1Aaa	As soon as you bring him inside you should put him in a crate and when he goes take him directly outside - continue until he has been trained, You could try puppy training pads.|`|Ex3XC0ayaa	You might try putting out puppy bathroom pads. You can find them at Wal Mart in the dog items. Lay one out where he has already gone and then set him on it. Once he goes on it he should go to it every time.I hope this helps...Good Luck|`|7Rp256IOaa	I would have him checked out by the vet.  He could have a bladder infection.  Being a male he might be marking instead of going when you are out with him.  Once you rule out any physical issues, I would treat him as if he was a brand new puppy that doesn't know anything.  Even though he is 11 months old, he has been through a lot of changes in his short life.  He needs to get used to your schedule you put him on.  One month is not long enough to do this.  Make sure you take him out immediately after he wakes up, eats, plays, and so on.  When you are outside, make sure he gets some exercise.  This will help get the juices flowing as will taking him away from the house and in new surroundings where he will want to leave his mark.  Once he does go outside, most people make the mistake of immediately bringing the dog right back inside.  But what does this say to the dog?  If I don't go, I get to hang out a little more in the exciting outdoors.  Once I go, I am brought back in that boring house, probably to be left alone.  Instead, reward him with play or a walk.  This might also encourage him to empty his bladder.  Then, once inside, be sure to keep him with you at all times so you can watch for signs he has to go.  Don't yell at him if he does start, simply bring him back outside again.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Limit freedom. He has too much freedom. And when he does go outside, have treats handy to praise him with. <br>  <br>  He can wear a doggy diaper in the house if you want. It does prevent the actual leaking and whatnot getting onto the floors, but it doesnt work unless you actively train him and limit freedom.<br>  <br>  Tether him to you and any signs he has to go, take him out on lead. Walk back inside and give him a few minutes. Then go back outside after 5 minutes until he goes again. <br>  <br>  I would get him on a schedule of when he goes out and when he eats/drinks. Take him out every 30 minutes praising every time he goes outside. Anytime you CATCH him going inside, a stern NO is needed and immediately he must be taken outside. <br>  <br>  If you dont catch him, clean the mess up without any fuss. No getting mad either. The dog doesnt know. <br>  <br>  If you tether him to you, you should see most accidents stop.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Have you sterilised the accident sites?  If he can smell it he will think it is ok to go there!  Not a good plan.<br>  <br>  When you are home let him outside every hour for potty when he goes praise him.  When he is bad in the house put him outside & ignore him for 10 minutes.  You could also try putting newspaper down by the back door & if he uses it praise him, it will all come together. <br>  Try crate training him.  He is obviously very confused & when you think about it he is still only a baby who has not had the best start in life.  A crate, fleecy base, blanket, cover for the top to stop him getting scared from things flying at him from above, some toys, MOST IMPORTANT something of yours that you no longer use (he will associate it with you & safety).  <br>  <br>  If you already have a dog that can help with this problem.<br>  <br>  Does he have access to lots of water? You could try restricting it for a while & see if it makes a difference. It all takes time & patience.<br>  Good Luck.

I suggest looking for a underground filter. <br>  Also, remember this won't eliminate the need for weekly-biweekly water changes, since it doesn't remove the ammonia in the water.
YRJFo6K0aa	Neutering is not an operation that is routinely performed on hamsters (actually, any surgical procedure on a hamster is going to be unusual) as it is an unnecessary risk to the animal's health and there are few good reasons to be doing it. Even if you were to find a vet that would do the procedure (which would probably cost you a good sum of money) it is unnatural for male and female hamsters to live in such close quarters and they probably would be unhealthy and uncomfortable. Some hamster species are actually solitary and should not be kept together even if they are of the same sex. Do some research on hamsters and particularly the breed you are interested in in owning -your local library will probably have some books, and you can always call the vet's office if you have any questions. If you are dead set on having a male and a female, the safest and happiest option for them (and the least costly for you) would be keeping them each in their own personal space.

2CbfO4jWaa	imo, no it is not but im sure some people will say it is (people with no bearded dragons or people with soon to be dead beardies). then again my standards of reptile husbandry tend to by higher then most (all? hahahahahahah! j/k) i demand success with my captive and a heart beat alone is far from success keeping a species. this is what a proper bearded dragon set up should look like <a href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u161/jayhardcore/Picture300.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u161/...</a> e-mail me for any specifics (temps and humidity gradients, substrate choice etc...)or just add more to your question. i tend to go back and check. good luck and you have a very nice beardie.<br>  <br>  p.s. take all info you get here with a grain of salt. there is a lot of "computer chair/care sheet experts" around here with very little practical (success full) experience with the animals they claim to know so much about. yahoo answers spreads more bad info then good.<br>  <br>  p.p.s. hahahahahahahahahahah! all this talk about needing a hide. beardies will use and love a nice burrow to hole up in but when you people talk about hides your thinking about some store bought half log crap that doesnt allow your beardie to feel secure since IT doesnt recognize it as a hide (just the closest this to one) give your bearded dragons some nice deep dirt and watch them dig out their own "hides" (ones that actually benefit the animal by doing the job right)|`|ltIuUBXNaa	It's not a bad start.<br>  <br>  I would add a medium size water dish, yes they do need one in the tank. He also needs more branches to climb around on to get higher to the basking light. He also needs a better hiding spot for sleeping. Other than that you are on the right track. I loved the Canadian rock....|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I was going to recommend that you have something a bit closer to the basking light if he needs it but I think that is it in the last picture.

Rx7wv4JLaa	Having her live outside gives her no structure which could be the reason why she only listens when she wants to. It will be really difficult to train her to listen if you don't spend a lot of time on it. <br>  <br>  I suggest clicker training. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/</a><br>  <br>  The sound of the click itself plus treats afterwards may get her to focus more on you. <br>  <br>  I'd also try and convince your father that dogs are social animals and should not live outdoors.<br>  <br>  Add: never ever hit your dog with an object like newspaper or with your own body. This could cause your dog to become worse and possibly even aggresive towards you.|`|fBo5OpE7aa	Spank with a newspaper and say "No!" when she does something you don't like. (It doesn't hurt unless you hit hard-which you should not do). Give her treats and lots of praise when she does something that you consider good behavior. And be consistant in what is acceptable and what is not. Take her to Obedience Class if you can afford it.<br>  <br>  Most dog packs have an "alpha" dog- apparently in your household that is Sophie. It means she gets to push the other dogs around because they view her as a "leader"...but it's a completely natural behavior so unless she's preventing them from getting food or water or hurting your other pets...don't worry about it too much :) If she is though, I would advise you keep her out of the group and call your vet for further advice. Sometimes dogs get aggressive when they are not feeling well (rather like people) and it may be that, also.<br>  <br>  I have only one dog that won't chase cats but he was raised around one so it explains why he doesn't. My theory is all dogs chase cats so I can't help you with that one.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this was some help to you.|`|K1naPFDvaa	Is there any dog school around your area?<br>  I think your dog need obedience training.
b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	shelter time for you|`|KbZi3Qm3aa	What ever you do only get a dog that will fit your life. Most puppies are very full of it and if you want a calm quiet dog don't get a puppy go rescue a sweet older dog. Then you don't have a bad time with ruined furniture and such. But if you want to go that route I think some more research online or go to the library should give the info you need. The smaller breeds seem to have more energy than the large breeds. <br>   But Really if you are going to get a dog be ready for some chores to go along with the fun. Cats are different they could really  could care a less about much unless they are hungry. Favorite dog in the whole world was a female Australian shepard, she was the smartest, loving dog I have ever met. But she needed lots of room to run as she was a very busy dog who loved to go or just sit as long as she was with me she didn't need much else. And she kind of mother hen'd all us kids.|`|6t5kQnSFaa	A dog would be more of a friend to a cat than a puppy. Puppies are too energetic and too inquisitive and get into more face-offs than an older, more calm dog.<br>  <br>  Dogs and cats don't just become friends. If it were two dogs - you can train them to get along, but cats are a species all of their own and the results wouldn't be set on whether they could get along or not.<br>  <br>  If you want something non-energetic, again, no puppy. Head to a local shelter and pick out a small OLDER dog.|`|S9sZawG2aa	Get a Yorkie! I got a Yorkie pupy about 6 months ago, and I love her to death. Her name is Bella and she is the best watch dog ever, better than my two lazy big dogs! She gets along with all other dogs animals, and is the sweetest little thing. She is smart, and we call her "the supermodel" because she has really long legs and is like 10 punds and struts around with an air of confidence haha. she is an excellent jumper, and she can be a lot of fun , but she also knows when to just curl up on your lap. i take her for a walk around the block every 2-3 days, and brush her about once a week. she's super easy to bathe, you can just do it in the sink and it takes less than 10 minutes.|`|HztriBPAaa	I would go to the shelter if I were you. A lot of the time they have behavioral specialists and can tell you if the dog gets along with cats. Personally I love the pug breed and they are very family friendly and fairly easygoing but don't have a little yippy bark so they give the impression of a bigger dog.|`|t2glBSRVaa	I think you should go to a shelter & see different dogs & talk to the specialists there. Generally puppies need more time & dedication than an adult dog. Since you already have a cat, you may need to consider adopting an adult dog. Good luck.

6t5kQnSFaa	I'd speak with your vet. Sometimes certain medication can make the puppy extra sleepy and put him off his food for a couple days.<br>  <br>  However, if you're worried, definitely double check about the side effects that the shots he received could give him.|`|lBkY169maa	take it to the vet and get their answers
Rx7wv4JLaa	Do you plan on litter training your pup or teaching him to go outside? <br>  <br>  If you are to train him to go in a litter box or outside i'd start doing so now and get rid of the puppy pads. They will only confuse him. Puppy pads are great for situations where you are gone to work during the day and no one can let him out. Or in litter box training you can use the pads instead of gravel litter, I find the pads are safer. <br>  <br>  How old is the puppy? its very normal for a 2,3 or even 4 month old puppy to not fully understand where they need to go. Most dogs are not fully house trained until 6-8 months old. This is b/c their bladders are growing and they need to learn how to hold their urine and b/c their bladders at this point are pretty small. <br>  <br>  Have you been encouraging him to go on the pads? If not i'd start doing so now. If you teach him to go outside or in a litter box you need to praise him when he goes. If you catch him going where he shouldn't pick him up and take him to where he should and praise him if he continue to go in the right spot. If you don't catch him going in the wrong spot but see it later you can not punish or correct him for it. He by this point has forgotten all about it and will only be confused for why he is being punished.<br>  <br>  Lastly never rub a dogs nose in their urine, hit, kick or harm your dog physically in anyway. These do not teach him anything and in some cases could cause him to become fearful of you or aggressive towards you.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	Do you want this dog to go INSIDE your house ( anywhere inside the house) for the next 10 or so years?  if not,, i highly suggest your housebreak your dog and stop training him to potty inside,, that is gross and unnatural for a dog

They will be fine.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	no negative personality changes. Actually for my cats it changed their personalities for the better. They were also both males and after getting them fixed no more cat fights. They stil play with each other, and have their frisky side, but on the over all they became less aggressive with each other. Also in males it stops them from wanting to spray, and they wont go looking for females to mate with.|`|n0WnEIopaa	It doesn't take away loveyness of male cats. (Sometimes with females it will because they go into heat, and that's when they are cuddley due to hormones, not cause they want to be) <br>  <br>  It will make them be less aggressive, it will make them calmer, and it will stop them from starting to spray. (Once they start it can be impossible to stop them)|`|7WUvPI8maa	their personalities will change little. they won't be as aggressive later and this will also stop from them starting to spray in the future. besides the obvious though, getting your animals neutered/spayed are actually beneficial to them because it promotes longer healthier lives and there less prone to medical problems.|`|3gZgFQywaa	Both my boys are neutered.<br>  <br>  Since then, they are less agressive/violent with each other, more loving (they groom each other), and just as lovey/cuddly with us.<br>  Any personality changes were for the better.<br>  Plus, if you've never had a male cat spray in your house, be graetful for it and neuter them before it happens!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Their personality doesn't change at all.

You didn't mention what amenities you have at that barn, but $350/month does not sound too bad.  You should clear it up with her that you are not actually looking to buy a horse right now, since it seems like that's the impression she got.

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Wow about 127, as an Aquarist and a breeder i can honestly tell you that i have never kept that many fish in the same aquarium because that's is unbearable but not impossible. With that many fish is hard to really take care of all of them because you have to keep an eye on all 127 and make sure they all eat not to mention keeping the water clean. <br>  <br>  To be honest i do not recommend you to keep all these fish but if you insist you are going to need a minimum of 250 gallon tank/aquarium and several  really powerful filters to make sure that each fish get at least room to swim. <br>  <br>  Betta is not a good idea because either it might kill most of your fish or the smaller ones will nip at the beta's longs nips, and then their starts the chaos.<br>  <br>  Usually the fish you intend to keep are fish that should be in small aquarium anywhere from 10-30 gallon at most because big tank means big powerful filters and not all fish will be able to swim in powerful water current.<br>  <br>  Having 127 you should know for sure that they will breed and that means that the population can double in a matter of a few months.<br>  <br>  That's just too much, i would go will small number of fish even if you want a big tank that way if they do breed which some will whether you want it or not they will still have room.<br>  <br>  30 gallon tank will be perfect to have these fish but way smaller number of them, because something bigger than that will just not be so pleasant to look at, at least according to me.<br>  <br>  Wanting so many fish means that you might be interested in a huge tank which i can honestly tell you that it will be the perfect tank for Cichilds, discus, Oscar, any fish that will get quiet big and aggressive that will leave visitors drooling and wanting whenever they come for a visit.<br>  <br>  I am not discouraging you but i am just being honest, because i haven't seem anyone keep that many fish in a single tank.<br>  <br>  Take care i hope you don't take this the wrong way.<br>  <br>  PS: you should only add 2-3 fish at a time which is the maximum amount to add at a time.<br>  <br>  Additional: <br>  Forgot that you asked about the ghost shrimps.... They are aquarium shrimps and can be a plain clear color or mix color, they have been mostly used as food to carnivours fish than kepted as pets, but doesn't mean it can't be kept as a pet, just make sure the fish you buy/have are compatible with them otherwise they will be a tasty treat to theses fish.<br>  <br>  Please refer to this site for more information: <a href="http://www.centralpets.com/animals/fish/freshwater_inverts/fwi4997.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.centralpets.com/animals/fish/...</a>|`|nAK8bm91aa	First of all do you want your betta fish to kill the other fish ?<br>  This is what will happen, it appears you know nothing about what you want to do, I highly suggest you go to petsmart ans ask all the questions you want to know. Here your going to recieve answers from 5 yr olds and up meaning 10 yr olds, 13 yr olds who are going to assume an answer 4 you.|`|6CUEBlkfaa	if you want plenty of room for the fish, go with a 200 gallon tank<br>  the filter doesnt really matter as long as it says up to 200 plus<br>  same with the filter for the heater.<br>  i personally think natural gravel looks best like white, black, or brown.<br>  plenty of plants are great and the neons love to play in them. <br>  you need to add some fish in at different times. i would buy a few of the cheapest and let them adjust to the water temp by setting the bag on top of the water for 45 mins. just make sure they are able to live in the water then you can start adding more and more fish. <br>  <br>  if they are all working fine in the tank you can just keep them in the tank while cleaning it. you will need to by a gravel vacuum for the tank also. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|IHfxE7SEaa	I would get a 75 gallon tank or bigger.  Hang-on-the-back style filters seem to be the easiest type of filter.  Aquaclear and Penguin are some good name brands to check out.  A 250 watt heater should be good.  Keep the water at around 78-80 degrees.  Set up the tank completely, meaning, put in the gravel, fill with water, put in fake plants and rocks, get the heater and filter(s) running and leave it alone for 2-3 weeks.  This is going to be hard to do, but it will save you a lot of dead fish and a lot of frustration in the long run.  Doing this allows good bacteria to grow and spread in your tank.  Then you can start adding fish about 10-20 cardinals or tetras a week.  Pacing out the rate you add fish will allow the bacteria to catch up with waste that the fish are adding to the water.  A betta and redtail shark should be fine with cardinals and tetras.  Bettas don't like other bettas, but they do okay will other fish.  Redtail sharks can get pretty aggressive after a while, but it should leave the cardinals and tetras alone.  It might pester the betta, or it could ignore it completely.  You won't know for sure until you try it.<br>  Buy a mag-float magnet cleaner, they'll make your life easier.  Take about 25% of the water out and replace it with fresh water at least once a month.  More often is better.  You don't need to take the fish out when you do this. I think that's about it.<br>  Ghost shrimp are little clear shrimp about an inch long that most people use to feed bigger fish.  But they are very cool just to have and watch.  They might even breed in your aquarium, which is cool as well!<br>  The betta might not like the guppies, but you could try a few to test it out.  <br>  I know that's a lot of information to throw at you, but if you do it right, aquariums can be beautiful and rewarding pieces of living art.  Good luck!
SgeIPqKlaa	it think She is getting ready to give birth.  LEAVE HER ALONE WITH HER KITTENS!!!! cats are very protective of their newborns, especially if you just rescued her and she barely knows you!!! try to keep an eye on her while she is having babies, but give her privacy.  if she has been trying to get the kittens out for more than three hours, call a vet;there could be something wrong. When the kittens are a about a week old, try to see if the mother will let you get near them or pet them. if she doesn't, leave them alone until she does!!!! don't pick up the kittens until their eyes open. DO NOT return the mother to the alley you found her in. she could get hit by a car :( if no one wants her, the least you could do is put her in a shelter. i suggest you ask a local vet what to do. they will tell you exactly what to do in this situation.  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Cats are pregnant for about 63-68 days.

Around the time for delivery (queening), the female will seek out a secluded nest. It may be in a closet, under the shrubs, in the hayloft, or in the center of your bed. There will usually be little fuss or bother, but a few pregnant queens will stay close to the owner. Cats can delay the onset of labor or halt the delivery process if the nest is disturbed. Just prior to delivery, her body temperature will drop to under 100oF (37.8oC).<br>  <br>  Kittens are usually delivered after a few strong contractions that look like waves across her abdomen, with the entire litter being born in just a few hours. Some cats deliver part of the litter and then go out of labor for up to 24 hours before delivering the remaining kittens. This could be due to a lack of privacy during delivery, or because the kittens were conceived at different matings (which means the kittens in a single litter could be fathered by different toms). Pauses in the delivery process are perfectly fine, but if your queen is in active labor and straining for more than 45 minutes without producing a kitten, you should call your veterinarian.<br>  <br>  A placenta is usually passed immediately after each kitten is born. The female will lick each newborn to clean off the translucent membranes covering their bodies. She will chew the umbilical cord to separate the placenta and unless you intervene, she will more than likely eat it.<br>  <br>  Most mother cats stay with the kitten except for very short periods of time to eat and eliminate. NOTE: Female cats can and do go into heat and can become pregnant as little as 48 hours after delivering a litter. Mothers will move the litter to a more secluded nest if the kittens are handled too often.
yRrLsRpmaa	Average height for adult dogs is 28 inches, for adult females, 26 inches. Approximate weight of adult dogs ranges from 130 to 150 pounds, adult females from 100 to 120 pounds. The dog's appearance is more massive throughout than the female's. Large size is desirable, but never at the expense of balance, structure, and correct gait. The Newfoundland is slightly longer than tall when measured from the point of shoulder to point of buttocks and from withers to ground. He is a dog of considerable substance which is determined by spring of rib, strong muscle, and heavy bone.<br>  <br>  <br>  So it sounds like she's just about done. The info above is for breed standard, so there's slight variables with individual dogs.|`|KPk3LqbGaa	I haven't had any problems with my newfoundland.
1c4024e3b217f858e49bf522d7f35a41aa	Yes! They are Sulfur Crested Cockatoos and they flock to a roosting tree to spend the night. Sounds like they flock late at night to that tree, or whatever they want to roost it. It is normal behavior for those birds. Weather its normal for that area I can't tell you...What I can tell you is in the city of Arcadia, and some other places like Malibu, there are flocks of Conures that do the same thing. They fly back early in the morning then at around sunset they fly back to their roosting tree making quite the ruck-as as they fly.

Female birds can lay eggs with or without mating so good luck.|`|AA10596454	Cockatiels tend to breed like rabbits...CONSTANTLY! With or without a nest box present, they will continually breed.

He eat at the table with us and he loved mash potatoes he lived a good long life and his named was Lucky. I found Lucky out in the street on a fence. I gave he a piece of bread to entice him and it worked. Someone lost him. I tried to find the owner but no luck.

Will they? Probably not. Also, if you put two in the same cage, they will bond to each other and wont be tame anymore. If you really want a second one, get a second cage.

They will lay without boxes and everything. Maybe you could get another cage or one of those 2 in 1s. But maybe you cant. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Cockatiel Expert|`|qGqFwsrXaa	Usually they wont breed without a nest box. They should be fine.

Or you may prefer something that is as unusual as she is, like Witchicus, or maybe something softer like: Fizzy or Fisbane.  Also, be aware that oft times white cats, especially if they have blue, or alternate color eyes (both eyes of a different color) are also deaf.  It is very common, so jingle some keys or something behind her head and see if there is a response.  If you take her and she is deaf-remember to let her outdoors, as she cannot hear and that DEFINITELY DIMINISHES her chances at safety from other animals and trucks and cars.  Really, all cats should be fixed and kept indoors so they also do not contract fatal diseases like feline leukemia...but anyway, I have a deaf cat and there IS one very positive side to that---she does not fly off in sudden and swift horror taking half of the room with her when the vacuum clean is turned on - or the mixer.|`|jVBjKxpyaa	How about Snowflake :)<br>  She is unique and has her own type of style <br>  Can't wait til you adopt your kitten!|`|XOT9rHPMaa	Que Ball as in pool.<br>  <br>  |`|t3Zuec0taa	Mix-up|`|bJyO88Goaa	Do you have kids?

I have an odd-eyed white kitty, too-- her name is Illyria (Illy or Leery for short).<br>  <br>  Odd-eyed white cats have a very mystical, mysterious look, so I'd suggest looking up names from ancient mythology (Greek, Roman, Celtic, Egyptian, Norse, etc), from Shakespeare or maybe even from a popular fantasy fiction series (Lord of the Rings, for example). Spend some time at the library or do online research and you'll find many beautiful, original names.<br>  <br>  These are random, but I really like the names Idrial or Alisande for a female cat.|`|A9Koz4cqaa	I have a kitty with one eye and the most clever thing we came up with was uno:)  <br>  <br>  With two different colored eyes it is a sign of deafness so you may want to check if she is able to hear.

If two female parakeets are in the same cage, they will tend to fight. Sometimes even to kill!! So it would be advisable to keep them in seperate cages or sell one of them.

Also remember that healthy fish DRIVE sick fish off by picking at them. If this fish appears sick the look for sign of illness and put it to itself for treatment. White spots is Ich, fuzzy gills is another ilness with guppies.. keep a close eye on the Fat Boy, he may be a pregnant female.|`|AA11849364	as was said before, add a few females. You also might want to add some plants and a few ornaments so the fish could have a place to hide and not get picked on.|`|kSyhfGhqaa	How big is your tank? Maybe try adding a few female guppies. When the male guppies are alone they will pick on each other sort of like a social standing thing. But if you put in a few females, then they will be busy with the females instead of beating each other up. If that doesn't help, then separate them.
YxGyd2yZaa	Haha nice choices...<br>  <br>  Border Collie/Labrador. My all time favorite breed, plus the breed of dog I have now! My all time favorite breed is the Border Collie. But, I have a 5 month old yellow Lab. Yes. Mix those two guys together and that's going to be a long walk. As long as you are willing to put in a lot, I mean a LOT of time and energy to care properly for this breed, I would consider this breed.<br>  <br>  German Shepherd. My parents owned a German Shepherd. He was a very cool dog. I do not remember him, as he passed away before I was born. I have heard great things about him, so I am relating that to the breed. Great breed! I love German Sheps. <br>  <br>  Now. The Labradoodle. The dog that isn't a breed. The mutt. Do NOT get a Labradoodle. Just don't I can't even start a list of why you should NEVER waste your time even thinking about getting one.|`|TgRLsibGaa	Get a dalmatian, they are very energetic so it would be a very good walking or jogging partner for your mom and they are cuddly and will die protecting you if thats what it takes to keep you and your family (even your other dogs) safe, just as you would do for them, they are GREAT family dogs, medium sized, loyal, playful, and as long as they are kept in good health usually live to be around fifteen years and are even very active and playful in their golden years.|`|YgPf2UVMaa	A German Shepherd.  I have one that is right next to me.  They are the best dog.  They are great on walks and are big, cuddly and cute.  Mine is 9 months old and is 70lb.  They are very versatile and smart.  They do shed a lot, but that's the only bad side, unless you do not socialize them at a young age, then I hear they can be a hand full.|`|AxaspNJJaa	well since you say you're gonna get a dog from a shelter, you should see what breeds there are in there. A shelter is not like you can just search for this exact breed of dog and find one that fits what you want.

They are very loving and affectionate. They are also very good at fetch. They are the best type of lap dog and they will follow u around allot if you get a good bond between u and the dog. You can Still walk them but i prefer a harness because there heads are small and can slip there collar off. You can buy it a collar but make shure it on there tite but make shure u give the dog some breathing space. They always stay cute and u can choose if you want they hair long or short ( i prefer short much much cuter ). Because they are smaller dogs they don't eat as much so you don't have to spend allot of money on food. But also because they are small make sure your fence is all closed off so they dont run away. I think they are the best dogs ever|`|OKiMkaxGaa	Labradoodles actually shed and are not hypoallergenic. And unless you plan on adopting one from a shelter, you are being scammed by a breeder.

8cikAYp3aa	soap it well,  and if that isn't enough then give it a rub with a rag soaked in neatsfoot.  the oil will darken it  some but will remove the  spots.  <br>  I love my stubbens, the only thing that makes me sad about them is they dont make a western version.  I keep seeing people repeately complain about them being a rock hard seat.. I figured out why they say that today.  they sit hard on their behinds and not light in the saddle with their weight in their feet/stirrups.  I got lucky and got my first stubben in germany in the late 70's and I still have it.  Its been on 25 and 50 mile rides, training, schooling, jumping, plain old trail riding,  even shipped it out to montanna and took it up into the Bob Marshall wilderness for 7 days.  Never noticed a hard seat to tell the truth.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Where is the damage? Can you see it if you are riding? Sounds like the other two have great ideas for fixing the saddle up as well. If you like the saddle and find it comfortable (nothing worse than riding in an uncomfortable saddle) then I would say go for it. My saddle isnt name brand but its comfortable! But I would love to own a Stubben someday! :)|`|x787hJbBaa	County saddles are BAD!!!!! They are not very good quality. I know a whole bunch of people who have them, and they DO NOT fit their horses.

I Have ridden in others and i really don't like them.<br>  <br>  I really like county saddles. Expensive but they are so worth it. Mine is custom fit to me and my horses. <br>  <br>  I love a good used crosby too. I got mine for $300 and i love is so much. I had one with a medium tree and it fit alot of horses because it had a spring tree and was really cushy.<br>  <br>  Any saddle made in england is of high quality. I would really reccomend getting any model crosby over a stubben. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	If you clean it up, it'll probably be fine for shows. <br>  <br>  I have a Stubben as well, and I also think they are uncomfortable; The seat is rock hard! <br>  <br>  If you can ride in it before you buy it, go ahead and try it, but if not...I'd keep looking.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The seat is rock hard compared to my Prestige. Not to the point where I can't ride in it, but my old Wintec is more comfortable than my Stubben! LOL
lj3hNR9baa	If it is a baby fish then I am pretty sure you would see it swimming around. Since it is not doing that, it is safe to assume that it is a snail. <br>  <br>  Most snails that are found in freshwater tanks are asexual and do not require a mate in order to breed.|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	sound like a baby snail they clean your tank i have tons and they keep my plants tank rock everything spotless i believe they are like worms both male and female they just need to find another in order to reproduce alone they wont|`|oJoYk2Ataa	Some snails are asexual, some require 2 snails but can change genders, and apple snails have their own gender...depends on which snail really :D|`|tgROmqffaa	It very well could be a snail.

And if you have to ask, then you're not ready - emotionally, or financially - to take this task on.  If you want some extra money - get a paper route!|`|nmercOm7aa	You don't breed any animal to make money. Responsible breeders rarely break even with a litter and may lose money. It is expensive to raise animals. <br>  <br>  Get a real job.|`|meMF69tXaa	How much money do you have to begin with? Are you prepared to spend a good amount of money to get breeding stoc?. Are you prepared to have your animals tested for STD and other genetic conditions prior to breeding? Are you prepared to spend money with your pregnant female for vet care throughout the pregnancy? Are you prepared to spend money at the vet if natural labor will not take it's course and your female has to have a c-section done?<br>  Are you prepared to spend money for vet care during the first weeks of the newborn's lives? Are you prepared for everything else that comes a long with breeding?<br>  <br>  Seriously consider these questions before you decide to put two animals together to breed for profit. Most good breeders will tell you that it takes time and money and so much effort before you even start to make a profit Most breeders will tell you that they don't breed for profit, but rather for the breed itself.<br>  <br>  Plus, there are many unwanted animals in shelters right now from people who purchased or adopted them without considering all the money and care it takes for them and end up getting rid of them.|`|hdQvbs0naa	Breeding isn't something that makes a profit. You'll spend more than you earn if you do it right, and if you don't do it right you shouldn't do it at all. Especially not if you don't know everything about the animal you're breeding. It's irresponsible not to know the genetic background of animals you breed.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Tropical fish would be a good one but then you'd need all the right equipment to start with and that can be pricey, plus of course you'd have to be assured of clients to buy them.<br>  <br>  You really need to talk to pet stores and see what they're in need of and IF they'd be willing to purchase any animals from you.<br>  <br>  There's too many animals out there now without homes so your choice would have to be made very carefully.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Responsible animal breeders aren't out for the money, they do it because they love that particular type of animal.   For the most part, by the time you take proper care of the animals involved, there's no real profit in it.   If you're just out for the money, don't do it.
meMF69tXaa	(10 weeks is a little young to be alone)<br>  <br>  As far as allowing free range all over the house, I don't recommend it. You can section off one area of the home or make a play area for your rabbit in that section. We use baby gates, sea grass mats and metal (cage like forms, safe for rabbit teeth) for their play area indoors. Rabbit proof your home - well if you are going to allow your rabbit to be running around for certain periods of time. That means, no electric cords, no poison plants and nothing else that can harm your rabbit. Even the most well behaved rabbit can do some major damage to carpet and tile, so be prepared for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's your choice. Sounds like your little bun is happy and well taken care of. Good luck!|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	mine refuses to liter train so i have never but i know several people that have for years.

They seem to take very well to the litter box and he use to even sleep in my bed with me. I worked nights and when I got home he would snuggle up next to me while I ate dinner and watched TV. The only problem I ever had was that he use to like to chew through electric cords, as far as I know he never got zapped. All of my electric items had cords that were only a foot or so long I had to put plugs on the ends and had them plugged into short extension cords. Wasn't that big a deal for me, and I enjoyed having him around.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I wouldn't give her full range over the full house. Just make sure a room or two are bunny proof with nothing that can harm her and nothing you don't mind being nibbled on.  Two of my rabbit keeping friends give their bunnies access to parts of their house but they sleep in their cages for safety reasons.

That is the stupidest, rudest and most obnoxious thing I have ever heard of!!!  First of all, forget about your friend's family's financial issues.  That is their business and their business only.  I would also be offended if I was your friend.  I would be VERY offended if I was the parents of your friend.  Having my daughters friend making suggestions about our family's finances?!?!  Having a kid think that they are smarter than you is not a good thing.  And anyway how is getting rid of a dog help you pay off your mortgage?  And how would they ever pick which one?  You are obviously not very compassionate towards animals, dogs, or any other pets for that matter.  This was not your place to be butting in.  Mind your own beeswax!!!|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	From the sound of it, getting rid of the dogs isn't going to fix the problem.  Some people just make very poor financial decisions.  The fact that they cannot pay their mortgage is based on their inability to properly budget their home finances, not because they own three dogs.

Its not the dogs, its the people.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	I think it is their decision.|`|746YLjISaa	If they are having major financial issues they should give all away, not to be rude but it's not your job to tell her what she should do with her dogs, no offence.

Not that you cannot train them but you cannot start a business as such.  Just by the tone and questions in your mail tells me you are not ready for such responsility.  <br>  <br>  I was the same at your age.  I love dogs and had a natural ability with them.  I also started a dog walking service (like babysitting) and moved up to pet sitting.  As you get more clients and more responsibility, keep track of it. make notes.  Give your client occasional 'surveys' like, how do you think I am as a pet walker?  Am I reliable?  etc type of questions.  As you build your reputation (and experience) you will develop a rapport with people. <br>  <br>  You may also try working/volunteering at an animal shelter.  They have many difficult cases that require persistence and true training ability.  A pet that has been raised in pretty comfortable environment from day 1 is much easier to train/predict than a stray or abused animal.   <br>  <br>  Check out some local vets and/or dog groomers.

tgROmqffaa	its just like humans.  some sleep on their stomach, some on their backs, and some on their sides.  Apparently he prefers his side.  Also small animals like that prefer to sleep in small tight places because it makes them feel like they are closed in and sealed off from predators.  Apparently he feels safer that way.  So your tourtise is perfectly normal|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	Try to create him a place to nest and hide. I see those half hollowed out logs at the pet store. Make sure it's big enough for him to fit into.

MzHwklzKaa	Have you checked her for fleas and other parasites?<br>  <br>  If you're certain she doesn't have fleas, it's probably food allergies.<br>  <br>  Corn, wheat, milk, soy and sometimes chicken and beef can cause itchy skin.  Try switching to a food that doesn't contain grain and see if she improves.<br>  <br>  Innova EVO is doing great things for itchy doggies.<br>  California Natural Skin and Coat Supplement works wonders.<br>  Find them both at www.naturapet.com<br>  <br>  Sometimes bored dogs will scratch and bite at themselves.  Try exercising her more and getting her some new toys.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GSf09ALBaa	She is scratching herself and chewing on her paws for a very good reason.  It may be food allergies or another type of allergy.  The only way you are going to find out and correct it is to see your vet.  They can run tests and prescribe the right medication.<br>  <br>  What are you feeding her?  You may want to try and change foods.  Often, in lower grade foods there are many fillers such as corn most dogs are allergic to.  <br>  <br>  Also, when you see the vet, have them cut and sand down her nails.<br>  This will help with the cutting herself.|`|YConLSzXaa	Dogs lick their paws if their stressed.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Chewing on paws is a sign of an allergy with the dog's skin, as is the scratching.  Usually it's either a severe allergy to flea bites (even one flea can do this) or to something in their food.<br>  <br>  Easiest first step is to get some Frontline or Revolution and treat for fleas.  If the dog still reacts after a week, then you can be pretty sure it's food allergies (or a contact allergy from something in the environment--perfumes put on the dog via shampoos, sprays used for deodorizing, cleansers, etc.).  <br>  <br>  The vet will know what dog foods are most likely to be allergy free and can suggest some. Not all are expensive, it helps a dog to be on the right foods for their condition.|`|KxjUim7yaa	She does this because of allergy. Allergy to grass, cleaning products, or food to name a few. Many times it is to the food, and easily fixed by a change to a better quality food. Your vet may be of some help in helping, but basically you may be on your own. Often it is to corn or other grains. My dog is allergic to all grains. A dog can be allergic to chicken,beef,eggs or other food items. Change completely like from chicken and corn to lamb and rice. See if that helps.It takes about 6 weeks to see a great improvement as the body has to clear all the allergen. I advocate grain free food for dogs. Also I believe the coat can be helped with Salmon oil.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	She may have hot spots or allergies. Or just plain bored.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	Sometimes it is just a habit.  Although some dogs chew at themselves if they are in pain.  Ear problems are a common reason for dogs to scratch themselves or chew their paws.  We see alot of that in the grooming salon..  If it is just habit. Try to find something else for her to chew on.  Some kind of distraction.|`|ZEIqeThNaa	Have you taking her to the vet? She may have fleas or allergies. These is almost always medical. Take her to the vet and they can tell you what needs to be done. It maybe change her food, give her meds or perhaps she need lotion applied.|`|BvJeEbWlaa	She could have fleas or dry skin. It would be a good idea to take her to the vet so they can check her out for any serious skin infections or anything. They can probably suggest a nice shampoo to help your dog feel more comfortable!
YAPEpa5baa	Access to hay 24/7 is a necessity in a guinea pig's diet (preferably a high quality hay vs. the stale crap in the bags at the pet store).  If you're allergic, you have 2 options - don't get a guinea pig, or any other critter requiring hay (like a rabbit), or live on allergy pills or shots.  I choose to live on allergy pills, since I need to take one everyday for everything else I'm allergic to.|`|3sB49YNnaa	There are going to ba a lot of people that are going to mark this post with a thumbs down because it disagrees with a cherished belief in the pet guinea pig community.   Hay is not necessary for guinea pig survival.  Marking this with a thumbs down is not going to change that scientific fact even if it makes some folks feel better.<br>  <br>  A hay and pellet diet is better for guinea pigs than pellets alone, largely because of the variety it offers.  That said, lab colonies are routinely raised with pellets only and no hay.  Good quality pellets are a complete diet on which guinea pigs can thrive and survive no matter what the current popular mythology says.  They do not need hay to keep their digestive tracts moving, they do not need hay to wear down their teeth.  There are colonies that have been raised since the 1940s, that is for hundreds of generations,  on pellets alone which is the empirical, scientific proof of their completeness of the diet from a health and survival.<br>  <br>  Having said that, we feed our animals both feed and hay because pellets alone are a pretty boring diet even if it is complete.  However, if the choice is between giving up a beloved pet or giving up feeding it hay, give up the hay and feed some veggies that are high in fiber if you are worried about roughage.|`|xyPpruSjaa	No, I'm afraid there is not! :[ Guinea pigs need hay to help with their digestion and to wear their teeth down. Guinea pigs should probably have hay at all times, it's like giving a fish water if you know what I mean? Maybe wear long rubber gloves when you are putting hay in or cleaning the cage so that no hay touches you. I hope you will still be able to get one, maybe you're not allergic after all!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MhW3pLhLaa	No, I'm sorry. :( Guinea pigs need the nutrients in hay and it should be part of their regular, every day diet. Hay also keeps a guinea pig's teeth at a normal length. Without it, they won't get all of the nutrients that they need. Try to put on gloves or something when handling the hay and try not to breath it in.|`|juyA6HUJaa	No hay is an important part of guinea pigs diets, they constantly eat and if it was always food they're get way too overweight, it also keeps their teeth at a good length, there are hay disks you can buy but its not as good and you still have the problem of it being hay.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	No they need it and will die without it.<br>  <br>  Just don't be around the hay too much and ask your doctor :)|`|8f29e75cf611442d491dd15fec4eb6cdaa	You can also try putting the hay in single servings in brown paper lunch bags. Roll the top down and toss the entire bag in the cage. The paper is untreated, so it is safe for them to chew. Mine have always enjoyed playing with the bag while getting at the hay. Just make sure to handle the hay in as open space as possible or have someone else put the hay in the bags for you.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	No, guinea pigs need the fiber provided by the hay. There are little "hay cubes" that you can get in pet stores. They are compressed cubes of hay and therefore don't put out dust or anything like regular hay. However there is much less hay and it's a bit more expensive.
pvm8wo9Waa	Never buy a dog or puppy from a pet store!  These dogs come from large commercial breeders, often have severe health and behavioral issues; many times they cannot be crate trained and are difficult to house train and may have many other issues.  <br>  <br>  Instead, look on the internet for either Pomeranian show breeders, the Pomeranian club which should have a list of breeders or you can do a search for rescue if that is your preference.|`|nmercOm7aa	There is no good pet store anywhere to buy a dog. <br>  Either get a rescue to go to a responsible breeder.

Rx7wv4JLaa	There is a very good chance she is just losing her winter coat. This is about the time of the year that most dogs start to. <br>  <br>  From the sound of how much is on the brush it really sounds like she is just losing her winter coat. <br>  <br>  However since you have not experienced this before I suggest seeing a vet just to make sure.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	If she's healthy and on a good diet, then she's just shedding her winter coat.  <br>  <br>  All you can do is keep brushing her daily to get out that dead hair.  If you want to invest in a really good tool, try the Furminator.  It's expensive, but it's really good because it gets out all that dead hair and makes your job much easier.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Sounds like she is starting to shed the winter coat.  Also could be the food you are feeding.  You should be feeding a premium dog food and add essential oils, like Omega 3 and 6's.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Labs just shed a lot.  Also you said she's turning 1.  So like her full coat is in now.  And she is just shedding it.  And yeah it could be her shedding her winter coat also.  But Labrador Retrievers shed a ton!<br>  I say as long as she's eating and acting ok.  Then she's fine.<br>  <br>  Shedding can also be a sign of stress.  Did your routine change?  Something new going on?  Etc.<br>  <br>  If nothing is new is going on, she's eating ok, acting ok.  And everything.  <br>  She is fine, just shedding her coat like all Labs do!<br>  <br>  But if she starts acting weird, not eating, etc.  Then you might want to call your Vet.<br>  <br>  But I say she's fine!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Oh and also.

I know  your pain I have a german shepherd (11 years old), and he has an undercoat, his fur is so annoying one minute I'll brush him and the next there will be fur all over him. When the weather gets warmer, I usually give my dog a bath after this time of intense shedding, or if you don't mind taking him to a groomer and paying alot of $$$$. In the summer, though it will get better, so no worries. I hope that helps.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Could be winter coat shedding or heat cycle. Even if she is fixed females will still blow their coat twice a year.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	She is shedding because her coat is in the final stages of changing from puppy coat to adult coat. It is also close to spring and my BF (who breds poms )said that her dogs started their spring shed very early this year.  She will always will shed but in the spring and fall it is the worst.  Get a furminator--they are great for getting rid of undercoat.  If you use it weekly you will cut down on the normal daily shedding.|`|lXHQEk0gaa	prolly just the winter coat.  As long as your dog isn't developing bald spots i wouldn't worry.
bPdqwkpPaa	The AKC name for the breed is Bulldog, so right there that the header on their sites is "English Bulldogs for Sale" tells me that something isn't right. Then, they continue to refer to them the same way. <br>  RED FLAG<br>  <br>  I see NOTHING about them actually showing the dogs.  RED FLAG  Yes, they say that the dogs are champion sired, but where are the breeding dogs?  Where are all their show photos and bloodlines?  <br>  <br>  1 year Guarantee?  RED FLAG.  And it's only for "Life Threatening Disease"?  RED FLAG  It also says that you must return the puppy (at your expense) and your only option is to get another puppy.  RED FLAG<br>  <br>  GENETIC problems like Cherry Eye are not covered by this guarantee.  They claim it's "common".  It's only common in poorly bred dogs as it's a genetic problem that most responsible breeders would screen out. <br>  <br>  You can get a dog 48 hours after paying.  HUGE RED FLAG.  Responsible breeders screen you at length and spend time making sure that a specific dog is matched to you specifically.  <br>  <br>  Where are the OFA & CERF scores on the parents?  Where are the Dams?  ENORMOUS RED FLAG!<br>  <br>  The little information they do have on the sires is in Cyrillic (Russian).  This is so so so sketchy to me.  I would start to wonder if the dogs even match the papers. <br>  <br>  To me, this reeks of puppy mill.

H06PtiIAaa	oscars need to be in at least 75 gallons for one.<br>  <br>  2 oscars even breeders need over 125 gallons.<br>  <br>  albino or not, it doesnt matter.|`|QxJVD1Flaa	I both agree and disagree with "mike e" the one inch per gallon is really just for beginners who don't have a clue... For me I have a formula for how much the fish eats and how much waste it produces. Now let's talk Oscars. Have you seen a full grown adult? They are BIG, I've seen them get to 14-16" and they are bulky too, and they eat quite a bit, therefore making a lot of waste. Professionals reccomend 2 oscars for 50 or a 55 gallon tank. In a 29, it just won't have any room to swim. Imagine how a human would feel in a 4foot by 4 foot cell. Anyhow, 50 or 55 Gal. would be your best bet. <br>  <br>  As far as breeding them, oscars will only sex by themselves, you can't get a male and female and expect them to breed, so that may be difficult. Also finding out the sex of an oscar is extremely hard if not impossible. Generally you get about 5-6 oscars and there will be a chance that they will end up as a couple, but you got to take the others out, since oscar males  are agressive towards others if there is a female present. Once you have a couple, then it's pretty easy for them to spawn. It's the initial sexing that is sometimes quite difficult.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oJoYk2Ataa	Most people say 55+ for one, and 75-90+ for 2. They're aggressive and can grow over 12 inches(Regular 55g tank is 12 inches in width and your fish needs to turn). Maybe try convict cichlids, they grow to 4-6in and breed easily, plus you can feed them crushed flake foods rather than brine shrimp or infusoria starting from when they're born. They're very aggressive though, so I wouldn't add anything else to a 29g :D|`|f8RBtCVAaa	nos a 29 will work for 1 but a ton of people are about to tell u its not big enough for just 1 Oscar but remember u are fowling the 1 in of fish for every gallon, i hate that rule! but so many people believe in it

niztxto9aa	They make great pets for novice and advanced keeper alike. But it all depends on what you want personally. You should do some research on some simple aspects of what you may want in the long run with both snakes. Research size, how long they live, their behavior, their requirements...etc. Both don't require much, just the basics. Corns are more active snakes making them a great display pet. Bp's get bigger. They both live for a quite a while. They both come in a fantastic array of colors. So it all depends on what you want.|`|118h96Q8aa	Depends on if it is your first snake or not. If it is, I recommend a corn snake because they are very hardy, very friendly snakes. They're easy to care for because they typically don't need any special lighting or heating. However, Ball Pythons do need those things to live a long healthy life. Temperamentally, both snakes are wonderful pets.|`|MCmV7BOIaa	Both are really nice, ball pythons can sometimes not be as active as cornsnakes, we see our cornsnakes more than we do our ball python who is usually curled up under her paper or under her water dish|`|bOtk6QfIaa	Corn snake they have no teeth no venim and are very cute.|`|y3YHOZlaaa	All depends on the person.

H06PtiIAaa	depends on the size of the aquarium.<br>  <br>  For anything under 200 gallons, go glass,  for bigger tanks acrylic is better,<br>  <br>  Acrylic will need special cleaners, no ammonia based cleaners, and special algae scrappers.|`|hIyjdXr9aa	I prefer glass because acrylic always seems to scratch, and then you have to buff the scratch out, which is a pain to do and doesn't always work.  Glass is fairly cheap to buy but acrylic is, too, and if you're making one of those mondo thousand gallon tanks, there are a lot of guides online to make your own tank using acrylic sheets.  It's apparently less expensive to make your own extremely large tank rather than buy it, but I think you'd have to factor in the price of buying/renting power tools if you don't already own every tool you'll need.  <br>  If you're plannning on having a sand base, then you might not want acrylic.  A single grain of sand stuck between your algae magnet sponge and the wall of the tank, and all of a sudden a giant massive scratch grows on the main wall of your tank.  If you have a gravel or coral substrate, then it wouldn't matter so much.  But never again will I combine sand and acrylic.  <br>  I really do prefer glass.  But that's just me.  Both glass and acrylic work, and both have their ups and downs.  Glass is hard to get scratches out of, but rarely if ever gets scratched if you take good care of it.  Acrylic seems to get scratched from the slightest thing, but is a cheap building material for those really massive thousand gallon tanks and could be a feasable option if you have a non-sand substrate.

AA10838924	Almost any member of the Grammostola genus is going to be docile and easy to care for, but cheap is something that they're not!  Aside from the Chilean Rosehair(Grammostola rosea), most will cost a pretty penny...or two.  I've already answered the question about the Ephobopus(Skeleton)tarantulas, which are not generally docile and do require a bit more advanced care due to their need for humidity.  <br>  MY personal faves are the native US Aphonopelmas, especially A. chalcodes and A. hentzi.  While most are not the most colorful tarantulas in the world, they usually are very calm and docile and very easy to care for, and fairly easy to find, too.  I know you already have a Rosehair, but did you know that those come in different color phases?  The red color-phase(also known as "RCF"'s)are simply stunning to look at, and in my experience, better-tempered than the normal ones.  Here's a short list of the ones I have found to be docile and easy to care for, though as you probably already know, personalities vary from spider to spider, and they are all subject to "mood swings", lol!  I've got pics of every one of these, by the way, just ask and I can send a link.<br>  <br>  Grammostola aureostriata-"Chaco Gold-Stripe", a MUST-HAVE-get HUGE, very docile, pretty colors-one of my favorites<br>  Aphonopelma chalcodes-"New Mexican Blonde", "Tuscon Blonde", "Flagstaff Orange"-Nice-colored sweet Southwestern species<br>  Aphonopelma hentzi-Common "Texas or Oklahoma Brown", also found in Louisiana, Missourie and parts of Arkansas.  Not brightly-colored, but usually gentle-natured<br>  Aphonopelma iodius-"California, Nevada or Utah Brown"<br>  Brachypelma albopilosum-"Honduran Curly-Hair"-Get BIG, usually docile and less prone to hair-flicking than most Brachy's.<br>  Brachypelma emilia-"Mexican Painted", again, not too bad with the hair-flicking, colorful and calm<br>  Eupaulaestrus campestratus-"Pink Zebra Beauty"-Good luck finding these, now-rare, sweet and laid-back species<br>  Thrixopelma sp.-Several of these are available, sometimes under different species names, usually colorful and docile<br>  <br>  A lot of folks will recommend Aphonopelma seemani, the "Stripe-Knee" tarantula, but I haven't found these to be docile at all, and I've had several.  Many will recommend the "Pink Toe" tarantulas(Avicularia sp.) but these require far more specialized care, as do all arboreals, so I would not consider them "easy" to care for in that respect.  If you do not mind a bit of skittishness, or paying a bit, though, I would also recommend a Green-Bottle Blue(Chromatopelma cyanopubescens), since the adult colors on one of these is hard to beat and they are easy to care for!<br>  <br>  I have to ask, though, why you stated that your Grammostola pulchra was "torture"-was it aggressive, or are you referring to what you had to pay for it?  I've got one of these, huge female, and she is a sweetheart.|`|Pv8cj7cjaa	pink toe, king baboon, cobalt blue , tiger rump,mexican red leg not red knee i see you have 1 they are different,costa rican zebra , bird eating tarantula. thats a few i know of other than what you already have. good luck with your colection
vJO69YONaa	this could be a slipped disc in his spine - dogs lower to the ground are normally more prone to this - the vet will do a orthopedic exam on him tomorrow morning but try to keep him as quiet and calm as possible - keep him confined in a cage if you can to prevent him from hurting himself more. good luck!|`|dmNCk1kZaa	its very hard to find out whats wrong with a Bull Dog, they just won't show any pain. <br>  mine broke his ankle and limped around on it but when I or the vet moved the joint he wouldn't show any pain. wasn't til we got x ray-ed we knew for sure.<br>  good luck tomorrow hope his alright. <br>  I love Bulldogs their the best. sweet as honey but tough as nails!!|`|peBGF090aa	Something in his back, the not being able to jump is a clear sign.

3268e8d024b704cf849382ae55cd77ceaa	Yes it can cause this behavior.  It is uncomfortable when a shoe is loose.  It can also cause pain.  This horse may also be barn sour and took advantage of you (new owner) and of the situation.  Horses aren't dumb and sometimes will try things to see what they can get away with.  This time he saw he can get away from you and may try it again.  If this continues get an experienced person to help you immediately.  This behavior can seriously get you hurt.|`|C2rPPVSYaa	Well, I never had a horse but I read a lot of books about them.I will say that he is new and he has a new owner and the horse is under pressure.
WRoOZWcFaa	I am not sure where you live. It depends. I do know I live in South Carolina and I volunteer at out shelter. It will have about 12,000 animals pass through each year. However over 7,000 are put down because of many reasons. Either there is no home or room in the shelter. Maybe the  animal was so sick or abused he/she could not be trusted to be adopted out. It is heart breaking to sit out side on a Saturday morning and have people bring in their pet. I have to tell them we have no room and the animal will be put down. It amazes me to see how many people can look at that animals eyes and say okay take him I can't handle him anymore. I go home and cry every time I have to do it. However it has to be done. You as one person can help though. Animals cost money at shelter. If you go to school your school and raise money for food and supplies or if you are old enough you can even volunteer your time. Even if it is just a couple of hours a month. It helps them out so much and other time can be spent on caring for an  animals need. I am not sure again where you live ,but here for every 5 hours of volunteer help the money saved can give a dog a flea bath and first shots. Amazing is it not?|`|u1HahCoqaa	In North America/Europe?

B6zl0AJDaa	It is called "Barn Sour".  This happens when a horse would rather be back at the barn then out on the trail.  Simple solution, when you've turned around ready to go home, he starts firing up, turn him around and go out a little farther.  Turn around, if he starts it up again, go farther down the trail.  Eventually he WILL get the idea that if he stays quiet, walks back home then he gets to go home.  If he fires up he has to go farther out down the trail...|`|jUjkvis8aa	Your horse is anticipating the turn for home. Stables = food and friends! The problem is worse with other horses as he is racing them aswell. <br>   If possible you should vary your hacking route. Instead of going one way down the bridlepath, go the other for a change! Or simply go on another track altogether.<br>   If it is not possible to change your route, and when head for home your horse starts going faster, turn him in a small circle and carry on going the other way. Go the other way for about five minutes, then turn to go back home. Carry on doing this whenever you feel him tense up.<br>   If you feel a bit insecure in the saddle when he's doing this (I would!), use an old stirrup leather as a neckstrap.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :)|`|4KY26xQqaa	This always happens to the horse I'm training just now. But he just flat out gallops and bucks alot. I keep my reins short every step he takes and stop him and then walk him and if he goes off on a gallop I stop him and walk him and if he does it again I stop him and so on.<br>  he soon gets the point that if he is going to be nuts then we shall just stop. When we are out with other horses there are normally 3 of us, so we put the two mares in front and he walks behind them|`|wTLb3v3Xaa	it is called barn sour.<br>  He likes home better than the trails so when he gets close to it he gets excited and tenses up . <br>  so that is the problem but how to fix it is more complicated. you might want to try a different bit but you must start keeping him under complete control when he does this. No quick paces no bad behavior's he must walk quietly and if he doesn't want to make him do circles for a bit then try again.<br>  this type of issue only gets worse with time so deal with it now.<br>  Good luck !|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	It is probably because he is excited to be going home to rest and to a feed.  It is normal behaviour but you must insist on good manners from start to finish for this not to become a serious issue.<br>  <br>  The natural instinct for you is to grab the reins and tense up, but what you need to do is to slow your seat down so that he has to get back to your pace.  You know when your hips swing to his movements, try to slow the swing down.  If he jogs.  Turn a circle.  Then go on again.  He will soon get the idea that it takes longer to get home jogging than it does to walk in a straight line!<br>  <br>  It is always best for the horse to walk home for the last mile or so.  That way he can wind down after strenuous exercise.  I hope this helps.  Perseverance will help.|`|k4Tl4SBQaa	my share used to do the same i change route and he diddent no where he was going so listened to me <br>  hope it workks<br>  zoe babes..x|`|780c50eb467560c6248a0ca6f53da60caa	Most horses know they are headed home, he is looking to get home because he knows as soon as he gets there he will be fed, stop working, and be turned out. <br>  <br>  This is something you are just going to have to hack through. When you turn around to head back home and he starts to act up, turn him back around to do more work. He needs to get the idea that you are the one who is going to tell him that he is done working. <br>  <br>  I would work him alone for a bit untill he is confidant by him self and not acting up on his way home. The ease him out in groups. <br>  <br>  Its going to take baby steps. You already know what he is doing so anticipate what he is going to do next when you are working with him to imedatly correct him. <br>  <br>  You'll be fine and its a managable problem.<br>  <br>  However, if he is incredably barn sour, you may try taking his feed out to the end of the trail and feeding him out there too. Just so he looks forward to being out there and figures that the barn and the trail are good places to be.|`|e8e48d6449b24500a368442d4a2cf4e0aa	He's heading home so of course he's gonna be impatient. But he's also tight and that's very dangerous. Maybe try getting off before he starts acting up and change his headstall for a rope halter. then as soon as he starts to get antsy you can flick the rope at him and make him wait. Stop where he gets worked up lower his head and pat him lots let him know he's okay there and there's no need to rush. It might take a while but you got to be patient with horses.<br>  Good luck and stay safe. : )|`|075628be84a409c429b7c02c07f4c8fcaa	Its because he probably knows your hack route well and knows that hes heading for home. My horse use to do the same, he was fine until he got to the start of the road that the yard was on and then he would muck about & was also worse with other horses especially if it was mares i was out hacking with.<br>  <br>  Try changing your route if possible this should help.<br>  <br>  Hope this is useful.|`|g36NU81raa	Some horses can just get over-exited when they're going home.<br>  Try riding in a loop so he doesn't know he's going back, or hack with a very steady horse that won't gallop off if he does, because usually they want to go to see their friends. If one of his friends comes with you, then he'll want to stay with them hopefully!<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|BGXyxyIPaa	do you feed him when you get back? if so then dont cos that will make him wanna hurry home. try not to turn back to the yard try doin a full curcuit if you can then he wont know when your headed fr home. if he does get used to it then ride it the other way. if all this fails then just hang on for dear life! lol|`|KUsyxicwaa	My TB used to always get that extra " Pep in his Step " when we were heading home..

a7T20B8iaa	I had this same question with my bunnies and our vet had some advice.  We were told to do it very slowly and keep a close eye.  I know you can switch out their bedding as one option to get them used to scents.  Also, put their cages close together so they can see and sniff each other.  Swtich them out of their cages and put them in each others for an hour or two.  Get a small animal exercise pen so you can sit in there and let them play together.  If they get too stressed out, separate them and try it again tomorrow.  Be consisent and try it everyday.  Place something in the pen for a bunny to run and hide in, especially if one is smaller and shy.  Over time (probably a week or few) you should see that they tolerate each other and get along in the pen.  I had mine in a pen together for about an hour a day and then it was like 5 hours tolerating and playing together by 2 weeks.  Then just put them in the hutch or cage, shut the door, and watch their behavior.  Give it time and then have them spend the night in the same hutch.  If it works, you should see them laying together, bathing, eating hay, just being friendly bunnies.  Its all about observing, taking time, and separating them when they need it.  Good luck!!
meMF69tXaa	As the other poster stated - rabbits are very territorial when they reach sexual maturity. I know that most people want their rabbits to have "friends" but unless your rabbit is spayed or neutered, it is not a good idea. Even after altering your rabbit, there is not guarantee that the rabbit will get along with other rabbits.<br>  <br>  My oldest doe does not play well with others, which is fine. She's happy and well adjusted but does not like other rabbits. All of my rabbits are housed seperately for two reasons - personality and protection against disease. It's not worth the risk of all rabbits to be together because if one rabbit gets sick with a disease that can be contracted by other rabbits, I could loose my other rabbits to that sickness.<br>  <br>  It's up to each individual owner as to how they house their rabbits. I don't knock their choices. However, I have seen rabbits that have been in fights with other rabbits because they were housed together without being altered and the outcome was not pretty. I have also seen owners loose their whole group because of RHD and snuffles.|`|J2UTO39vaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  They are social when they have TONS of space. Also, they need to all be fixed.

GVR9AjoQaa	If you want to use tack to correct her you can use a breast collar with a tie down.<br>  <br>  Using this DOES NOT cure the problem- something is bothering or irritating your mare!  Check her teeth, sores in her mouth, a "sharpie" in her headstall that's poking her, etc.  She is only reacting to something she cannot control.  You don't see her doing this whne she isn't tacked up do you??  If not there's your answer- something, somewhere on or in her tack is getting to her!   She's trying to get a message across to you that something isn't right!|`|pYtnOnbDaa	ten to one it's just flies around her head....|`|oQHTQYHxaa	Well I'd get her checked out by a vet to rule out any medical causes and an equine dentist in case her teeth are an issue first, also if flies are an issue take care of it, and it my be the wrong bit. Have there ever been any previous problems? And she may not have ever been ridden with a bit. One of my aunt's horses did the same thing, and she tried some snap on reins that clip to the sides of a halter instead using a bit, or try using a hackamore. That should help! Hope I helped.
j2aAmFIOaa	i just got this off a website<br>  <br>  Crested Geckos are expected to live 10-20 years or so, though they are relatively new to the reptile hobby so this is a bit uncertain.<br>  <br>  About Crested Geckos:<br>  Crested geckos reach an adult length of around 7-9 inches (including their prehensile tails). They come in an wide array of colors and markings (morphs). They get their name from the fringed crest that runs from over their eyes down their necks and backs, though the size of the crest varies. They have specialized toe pads that allow them to effortlessly move along vertical surfaces, and their prehensile tails add to their agility. They are also good jumpers.<br>  <br>  Housing Crested Geckos:<br>  A minimum 20 gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for an adult, but larger is better. Crested geckos are arboreal and active, and need lots of vertical space for climbing, so a tall tank is preferred. 2-3 crested geckos can be housed in a tall 29 gallon terrarium (but males are territorial, so keep only one male per tank). A glass terrarium with a screened side for ventilation can be used, but some keepers prefer screened enclosures.<br>  <br>  the link is <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/od/lizardsaspets/a/lizardspets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/od/lizardsas...</a>|`|AA10920648	Yaaaay,  You are now on your way to picking up your  best friend and member of the family.   <br>  <br>  Get in your car and drive on over to the Animal Shelter.

They need a lot of expensive things like heat lamps.  For even a cheap reptile, you will pay at least 150 dollars.  The tanks are like 60 bucks, the lamps are 40 or 50, the reptile itself is usually around 50 to 300 dollars.  They die easily, because of how everything needs to be perfect.  And they really aren't fun.  They don't like you and would eat you if were you dead.  For all of that money and care, you'd expect something a little more rewarding.  <br>  Birds are pretty cool.  I suggest a cockatoo.  They're nice and social.

c65cd00cdb08dcd6d402f3bc9dea83d9aa	I have a 5.5 yr old Shiba.  I also have a nearly 6 yr old cat, who is the boss in the house.  Also have a 5 yr old cat, plus 2 Dwarf Hamsters.  The key to having a muti-pet home is supervision at all times.  My Shiba plays with the older cat, gets along with the other one, and sniffs noses with one of our dwarf hamsters (while I am holding it).  I do not allow our Shiba or cats anywhere near the dwarf hamsters when they are out in their hamster ball.  <br>  <br>  The better question would be "are you a good owner for a Shiba Inu".  Search for The Misanthropic Shiba and a Shiba Meetup group on meetup.com for one close to you, join, and learn everything you can.  The more research you do the better.  Shibas can be very challenging, they do have a high prey drive, are very curious and intelligent.  All of these things can be good and bad.  The owners need to do the training to be able to teach their Shiba how to behave.|`|WOvXaGUYaa	I've had a Shiba before and they are good little dogs, however, they are difficult to obedience train and prefer to just "do their own thing" with little regard to what you want. <br>  my dog got along great with other dog and cats, but I'm fairly certain your guinea pigs would be harassed if not killed by it. maybe not out of its prey drive, but even in play.<br>  If you did get one, you would have to introduce it to your other animals slowly... But if you are overly attached to your guinea pigs, I wouldn't recommend getting one.  Sorry :)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No, sorry.  Shibas have a high prey drive & the first thing they would kill would be your guinea pigs. Some get along with cats but the majority don't for same reason.

Here is an excellent site for good accurate info on shibas by shiba owners.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shibainus.ca/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://shibainus.ca/index.html</a><br>  <br>  Edit:  If you look below a few questions, you will see a question about what to do with a shiba that is biting kids due to his high prey drive.  These are the sort of issues that can  up often with shibas compared to most breeds.|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	They are a good dog for certain household. I'm afraid not for yours. The first answer was correct, it would eat your other pets...not bite them; eat them. <br>  <br>  Research lots of breeds before you make your selection. Always look for one that is made to fit your situation. Too many dogs are put down in shelters because owners don't plan ahead.
TgRLsibGaa	Great to find another dalmatian lover!!!! :) We always made extra shelter for our dals and tried to put them where there were lots of trees, if you do not have many trees where the dog is at, try making a covered area like with a tarp or something like that so that he's not in the sun so much you might try holding on to him if you can until the sunscreen can soak in and he cant lick it off, we always have to do that with ours especially the girl I have know because she is lemon spotted and very susceptible to sunburning, because of the extra light pigmenting. Hope this helps :)|`|xz4K7fuMaa	You need to keep him out of the sun.  Buy him a dog house or something that will provide shade for him.

l3IHlxylaa	you should leave it just for now cause its gonna give birth, but the filter may suck the shrimp right up..its your choice|`|tMtBe1lKaa	I'm trying this too. I've read it can be difficult to raise the fry since they are so small you will need special food. I've only read that once though, so I'm not sure if it's true.  Your tank tank has leftover food matter. Put a clear class ashtray in the bottom of the tank so they can hide from larger ghost shrimp. good luck!<br>  here's a link with more details on how to raise them.<br>  <a href="http://www.petfish.net/articles/Invertebrates/raising_ghost_shrimp.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfish.net/articles/Inverteb...</a>|`|OmXrz7Diaa	Leave the shrimp in the original tank for now. If disturbed or stressed they will sometimes abandoned the eggs and or young.
LqaxvacSaa	It's because you have had the tank for only 3 weeks.  You can speed up the process by adding another tank's water to your tank, but I wouldn't worry about it.  This happened to me, and I just never worried about it and my fish ended up being fine. In another month or so, the tank should have enough bacteria to recycle the nitrogen.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Do a 50% water change or even more maybe 80% as long as your tank has completed its cycle then all should be fone with doing such a large water change.
AA11253664	try with a parakeet first. they can be hand raised and wont cost you alot of money on the vet (IF you ever have to take the bird there),|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	My first bird was a cockatiel. I think that's the best first bird. I also have a parakeet but I think cockatiels are nice. Not too big and not too small. They are also smart and extremely loving. Here is a site where you can click on different birds and find out basic info. about them. Maybe it will help, hope it does! :-) <a href="http://parrotcentral.net/" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/</a>|`|jBOF9bYsaa	cockateils are great birds<br>  dont get these confused with cockatoos though. Cockatoos would not be a great beginner bird. keep in mind though that birds can live for a very long time! <br>  good luck :)|`|rUjUmXNjaa	parakeet for starters<br>  but if you have the time and money...buy a sun conure, they are so pretty and friendly|`|ojmuHLL5aa	A conure could be a good pet, but mostly likely will scream constantly and bite. I had a sun conure last year. He was super kind but conures are like puppies, they don't understand they're own strength and will most likely hurt you while playing. Noise is also an issue. If you live around touchy neighbors it could be a problem. They are louder than you think they are. But if noise and the occasional play bite doesn't bother you than I suggest you get one young.<br>  <br>  I know absolutely nothing of Quaker Parrots as they are illegal for a dumb reason in PA.<br>  <br>  Another thing you'll have to accept is the point that both of these birds will probably not talk at all and if they do it won't be clear.|`|BVZetG8waa	try a parakeet i had one or almost 8 years and it was the first bird i ever had just make sure to feed it everyday lol|`|vMByDy1raa	A Hahn's Macaw is a fun smaller medium bird.  They love to play and can talk some words.  They love to cuddle and socialize.  They also don't necessarily bond to one person. They have the funniest antics and just make you laugh out loud at all the silly things they do.|`|bFzu835Aaa	If you've never owned a bird before a Conure or a Quaker wouldn't really be the best beginner birds. They require a TON of care and attention and can be expensive as far as cages, toys, foods, vet care (especially when they get into something if you're not vigilant at watching them!). <br>  <br>  I would highly recommend a hand fed cockatiel or lovebird as a first bird. I suggest either hand fed, because you'd actually be able to play with and handle the bird, getting the full loving, goofy experience of either species. A budgie might be nice, but it's very hard to find hand fed budgies so you have to either be content with just watching it, or work very hard and diligently to tame it down. Tiels and lovebirds can be great entertainment, show lots of love and are in general great goofy little parrots for beginners. I personally would lean towards lovebirds, I think they're a little more playful and people interactive, but that's a personal preference.
RA3p25Qoaa	It can take 3 weeks to 3 months sometimes a little longer depending on the size and situation. If a crab is having some issues with their limbs or eyes they may do a double moult.  One of my crabs did this he moulted and his leg was deformed he came up and after two or three days went back and moulted again. <br>  <br>  ( This is for some of the people who responded and others that will likely respond mistaking moults for shell chages)<br>  Shell changes and moults are not the same thing. Shell changes take under 30 seconds and will happen when ever the hermit crab feels safe and in the mood to switch shells. This doesn't always happen because the shell is too small. It could be for lots of reasons: uncomfortable shell, evil painted shell, shell to small large heavy etc, or the crab sees new shells and wants to check them out.  The frequency of shell changes depends on the species, habitat, health, and mood of the animal.<br>  <br>  Moulting is the shedding of the exoskeleton. The hard skin that covers all the body except the abdomen. Prior to moult a hermit crab will eat lots and lots of food and take in more fresh and salt water. Then a few days of sluggishness and digging. Sometimes you'll see a black blister like thing on their side this is a " moult sack" where they store nutrients for while they are moulting. <br>  <br>  It's best not to bother a crab that is under ground moulting. If you haven't seen them in over 3 months closer to 4 months then I would start looking.  Hermit crabs never leave their shells when moulting and they do not drop limbs when moulting. If they surface moult you will find discarded exoskeleton. This may look like a dead crab but it will be hollow and have no abdomen attached. Always let the hermit crab eat their exo.|`|bOtk6QfIaa	what is molt ???|`|RkG93ZqBaa	i just got one yesterday and the pet store told me to keep about 4 shells of similar size so it can change often<br>  but it should have a shell that is slightly biger so it can move when it wants|`|XDTNSPO2aa	8 months it took mine but i think usually lot less
yQIOXv5Yaa	rabbit- take more space, more poop and mess since they are bigger, can require vet care such as neutering/spaying, but they are very friendly, can be leashed and taken outside and where ever far more safely, personally i've found them to have more of a personality<br>  <br>  sugar glider- can escape and hide easier- fit in smaller holes/under doors, more of an issue if you intend to let them run around your room. less expensive to feed since they eat less, less mess since smaller, also easier to pick up and move, <br>  <br>  hard to say, and both can be tons of fun!<br>  <br>  no you do not, bunnies are just fine alone.<br>  <br>  that depends a lot on space limitations. bunnies require a lot more room than sugar gliders and can be quite a handful if caged for awhile and not allowed out to exercise for several days. <br>  <br>  you could try visiting someplace with rabbits and spend some time playing with one. then once you've some experience with both types then choose. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ikTT4GkHaa	In my view i think bunnies are great pets, sure they take a lot of work but it is all worth it. <br>  I have two bunnies- but one came just two days ago, so it depends if you are able to spend a lot of time with the rabbit then one is fine but if not get two. But be sure to neuter and spray the two if they are a male and a female due to their fast reproduction.

Soooo you know my answer is A LIONHEAD rabbit.|`|i25ZcHnbaa	I dont know much about suger gliders but I breed lion head rabbits so I can tell you about them<br>  <br>  Needs a friend: No rabbits are veru independant but if you would like to get another one make sure they are both neutered<br>  <br>  Shows affection: Yes rabbits do they will sometime make a purring sound and they will lick you to.<br>  <br>  Uses a lot of feed: Not really they only eat about 1/2 cup of 16% protein based rabbit food<br>  <br>  Needs a big cage: It depends on the rabbit I would say 12x11" per pound that the rabbit weighs<br>  <br>  What do they drink out of: You can use a crock or a water bottle it does not matter. I personally like the crocks because they are easier to clean<br>  <br>  What do they eat out of: Just a small crock or small feeder<br>  <br>  Do they need toys: I would recomend some wood chew toys, and rabbit toys which can be found at a petshop<br>  <br>  What do they eat: I would recomend 1/2 cup of 16% protein rabbit pellets(Not more or less in the protein otherwise they can get diahrea) a couple baby carrots, a apple slice or two, parsley and timothy hay. NOT alfalfa hay. alfalfa hay may cause kidney stones.<br>  <br>  How often do they need their cage cleaned: I clean mine every 2-3  days but you can wait a week if you wanted to. <br>  <br>  Can they be litter trained: Yes rabbit are easy to litter train compared to some animals<br>  <br>  What bedding do I use for the cages: Aspen! Do not use any other kind of wood shaving. Rabbits are very sensitive to smells that other wood shavings have<br>  <br>  Do they need groomed: Yes but how often  depends on the rabbit. The longer maned ones needs groomed every other day and the one with a thin coat only need groomed once a week<br>  <br>  Do rabbits need baths: No rabbits are actually very clean animals.<br>  <br>  I personally love my rabbits. I especially reccomend the lion head. I would reccomend getting a doubled maned one if you can.

2IhKJjY1aa	Well if you can go out and quickly get a small piece of plastic breeding grass and put it in the stones at the bottom of the tank.  I have a 6 gal tank and that is what I did along with a small column ruin.  I have all female guppies in the tank and one or two of them had their babies and they are hiding in the grass.

JPBh5WT3aa	We hide treats in our backyard, and our dog (beagle/shepard mix) likes to find them.  For instance, doggie bacon strips.  Sometimes we will hide an item......like a toy....and he will try to find it.  We will drag the toy or treat all over the yard crisscrossing every which way....so the dog will really have to work to find the prize.<br>  <br>  We have the kong toys that well put a treat in that will take him a little longer to get to that we use sometimes too.<br>  <br>  In the summer he has a little kiddie pool.....and he enjoys splashing in that.  He especially enjoys watching and scaring off the birds who try to get a birdbath in.  <br>  <br>  Just try to make your yard as dog friendly as possible, and your dog will come up with her own entertainment.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	If she likes toys in the summer freeze them in a block of ice and put that out in the yard.

They positioned the fart machine near the trash can.........and when the dog approached the the trash can......the kids would hit the remote and the dog would take off. He would totally freak out over that "noise" coming from the trash can.....or food on the counter.

You need, atl east 10 gallons of water per inch of shell length.<br>  Here are some links to help make the platform.<br>  <a href="http://www.livefoodshop.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=60131" rel="nofollow">http://www.livefoodshop.co.uk/forum/inde...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.happyturtlespub.org/smf/index.php?topic=18367.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.happyturtlespub.org/smf/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.turtletimes.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=45936" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtletimes.com/forums/index....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Articles/How%20to%20Build%20a%20Driftwood%20Basking%20Platform.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Article...</a><br>  Here is an ideal tub it is about 120 gallons<br>  <a href="http://www.tractorsupply.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay_10551_10001_28420_-1______14602%7C14606%7C14614%7C28420?listingPage=true&Special=false" rel="nofollow">http://www.tractorsupply.com/webapp/wcs/...</a><br>  Some other ideas.<br>  <a href="http://www.turtletimes.com/forums/index.php?s=b2960662eacb6bf7ec3e68d7a14ca47f&showtopic=61502&pid=506127&st=0&#entry506127" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtletimes.com/forums/index....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.zabludow.com/stocktank3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.zabludow.com/stocktank3.jpg</a>|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	I've seen some nice basking platforms that are outside the tank, resting on one end of the tank. A wooden ramp allows access from the water and high sides keep the turtle from leaving the platform in any direction other than back into the tank.|`|uxcpAdJZaa	its called a rock|`|tgROmqffaa	if your putting the platform in the water you could prop up a small piece of plywood or fiberboard on a small angle.  Under neath that you could hold it up with rocks or something small like that.  The fiberboard may be better becuase it is made up of lots of little small wood chips which would provide traction.|`|EZjJnx4Eaa	whatever you don't get the warm rocks, your turtle will die. Get a piece of platform wood to put up there and make a ramp for it to climb up. I put a few fake plants and rocks on the platform they love that.|`|bOtk6QfIaa	well a warm rock some sand or a small hut made out of house hold items. <br>  examples:<br>  small plastic bin half circle cut out, a hollow log, bed made out of dead hay.<br>  <br>  HOpe this helps and good luck with ur turtle I wish I had 1
4yt4D3vMaa	It sounds like he had fin rot before you got him as this is regrowth which is different from normal growth. the clear parts can take months to colour up and are more fragile than normal fin tissue at first so keep an eye out for any damage.there are some bettas that have clearish colouration on their fins so you could try putting a photo on a betta forum to see if that's the reason. good luck with your new betta :)
tgROmqffaa	yeah.thats very normal and very good.  That means that his diet, sun bathing, and vitamins are allat the right settings.  If he wasn't shedding then you might want to be concerned.  But since hes shedding a lot you know that hes healthy and in good condition.|`|bOtk6QfIaa	Yah its totally normal esesilly 4 babies dont worry.and btw I think its cool u have baby geckos|`|v4vyq9Thaa	It is completely normal and even a good sign. The fact that they are shedding often means they are growing and that they are getting the proper diet and nutrition. <br>  <br>  keep up the good work|`|bDnp8temaa	i have one that is completely normal if it is a juvinlle
MhW3pLhLaa	Ooo, once I brought a mantis egg sac inside and I didn't know what it was and it hatched! baby mantises were everywhere! You don't really have to do anything if you want to hatch one inside, just keep it warm in a dry place.|`|ZAoqhBMxaa	On a plant or in a shoebox, they do better in a shoebox outside though.|`|kS1SPqxVaa	stick it up your vagina and incubate it from the inside
VXZLYJzSaa	I'm assuming this is a fresh water aquarium, if not please disregard this advice.<br>  <br>  Check your water is ok, ie ammonia and nitrite at 0ppm or mg/l depending on the test kit, nitrates are not too high, 50ppm or mg/l or less for normal tropical communities, maybe up to a 100mg/l if your tap water is high in it. pH should normally be around 6.5-7.5. If not then do a series of water changes, up to 50% at a time with dechlorinated water at the same temperature as your tank is kept at.<br>  <br>  Check your filters are running ok, check impellers on pumps etc and any media isn't clogged. Rinse in old tank water if necessary. Give your gravel a thorough cleaning with a gravel vacuum/syphon. Finally add a flocculant like API's Accu-Clear if the milky haze doesn't clear on it own after a day or two. Add some floss to your filters for a couple days to help pick up the finer particles but make sure to remove/replace before it clogs and causes the problem to repeat again.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Sometimes cloudiness can be caused by decaying organic matter or bacterial blooms. You can find chemicals at many pet stores to fix this.<br>  <br>  Is your tank planted? Some plant matter may be decaying.  Remove any dying plants, or dead plant matter that is caught in any decorations.<br>  <br>  Maybe one of your fish died and is hidden some where in your tank, decaying. That happened to me one time... Just count your fish, and if one is missing try to find it and remove it. You may need to add some chemicals.<br>  <br>  Also, check your filter, because there could be a decaying fish or plant parts trapped in your filter.|`|LqaxvacSaa	Change the filter.  If you do not have a filter with activated carbon, then you need to get one.  The activated carbon will remove the cloudiness.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	change filter, and possibly add another filter. Sometimes the fish grow larger, so are polluting the tank more. Not sure what you have in the tank though. <br>  You might check your ammonia just in case, and possibly do a 40% water change. <br>  Activated carbon helps clear a tank.<br>  Cloudiness can also be caused by algae. If you have been getting more light from a window, that's a possibility. Good Luck!|`|f8RBtCVAaa	it just happens and it dose not cause it. go to your pet store and ask for a strong chemicals to get rid of it or just wait till it clears up.
