In my country (New Zealand) they have a huge wine section in the supermarket, does everyone have that now?  Haven't been to Germany for 10 years but back then they did sell beer in McDonalds & spirits in little kiosks on the street, sort of like hot dog stands.  Never saw anyone drunk though, so I guess they can't have a binge drinking culture or teenagers that like to party would always be at McD's.

Loose leaf tea is sold by the ounce, and when brewing it, I estimate one teaspoon of tea per cup.

Around the last few minutes, I went to the refrigerator to get some ketchup out. I checked on the microwave and noticed that the power had gone out, even though it was plugged in and the house lights still worked. I unplugged it and tested the socket with my alarm clock, and the power worked. I'm afraid to plug the microwave back in. What caused this and is it safe to plug it back in? Was it the refrigerator that made the power out? I noticed that the refrigerator started humming and powering on after I used it. Would it be safe to plug it back in? I'm afraid that the microwave may be damaged even more if I do.      -Thanks

Shape a 1/2 tablespoonful at a time into 1/4-inch rounds and roll in the bread crumbs.    4. Place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.    5. Serve warm.

But for the last month and a couple of weeks, I gave up eating meat. Its restricted me from eating alot of foods I use to enjoy. And now that the restaurant opened I feel even more like I should give up being a vegetarian. But I feel like I made a lot of progress not eating it, and proud that I could accomplish it. And by eating it, that it was all a waste. What should I do?

I tend to eat them when I encounter them @ a salad bar. If/when I do buy them, I usually buy them canned, pre-sliced.      I have been reading a lot about the nutritional benefits of beets and wanted to add them into my diet on a more frequent basis. I would like to know:      1) Is there a big difference in fresh vs. canned?      2) How in the heck do you cook a fresh beet?      3) Is a raw beet like a potato.., in that you can eat it raw but generally people don't.., or is a raw beet like a carrot.., which I believe is yummy when raw or cooked.       Thank you.

20090222125749AAPLIjB	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Yesterday me and my husband ordered a pizza and a scallop platter?	from a pizza delivery place. He ordered a vegetarian pizza with beef and extra cheese on the top. I ordered  a scallop platter that comes with two sides. I ordered onion ring and french fries for my two sides.   When the delivery came, the whole order was wrong. They gave us a vegetarian pizza with no beef and no extra cheese on top. My scallop platter was suddenly a shrimp platter with only french fries. My husband called the store and demanded that the driver come back and get the food and bring the right order. The lady who takes the orders cursed the cook out for getting it wrong. The receipt had the right order on it. So what do you think happened? The cook has been there for 10 years. Can he read? Do you think they should have just let us have the wrong order free for messing the order up. They wanted the wrong order back. I just hope that they didn't sell that food to someone else.

Went to turn the oven on to start dinner and no luck - we'll have replacement parts by the end of the week, though.      However, I have a whole chicken ready to go for dinner, and I'm not sure how to cook it! It would be like cooking a BBQ chicken on the stove - I tried that once and it burned so bad I almost ruined the pan. (I can cook! I'm just still learning a lot.) Only instead of just being burnt sugar it would be burnt sugar and mustard gas..... So not looking forward to that.      Any ideas on how I make dinner? The chicken has already been marinating for 24 hours, so it's a little late to change ideas. It's already been cut into pieces.      We do not have a crock pot, a toaster oven, or a grill that works (not to mention it's 25 degrees outside). We also do not have access to another person's oven. All we have is an electric range.        Did I do something wrong the last time I went to cook BBQ chicken on the stove? I left the heat low and covered the pan and it took about 45 minutes to cook (boneless skinless chicken breasts). Is there something I can try differently this time, or should I just give up and freeze the chicken for when I can cook it in the oven next week?

Specifically, what would be the best way to boost my electrolytes?

Okay, so in every "perfect baked potato" recipe I come across, It always says that you put the potatoes in the middle rack of your oven, at about 375-400 degrees, and they should be done in about 1 1/2 hours. Ha. My potatoes have been in there for 1 1/2 hours, and they are still hard. I started out with them on the middle rack, but after a while, I moved them to a lower rack, hoping that they would cook faster, and they STILL aren't cooking. Help please?      BTW...I don't want to turn the oven to a higher temp. because I'm baking other stuff with the potatoes...      Thanks =)
