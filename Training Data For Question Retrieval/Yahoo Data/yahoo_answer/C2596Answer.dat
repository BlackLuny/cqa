Most vehicles that have a system that can become air blocked have a pitcock some where in a component such as a pipe or thermostat housing up high on the engine to let the air out. If your vehicle has a ptcock, open it. If no air comes out, it's not air blocked.|`|cddc8069d50a9c0970cf9101369f17fdaa	You need to be more specific,car cooling or house,if car what kind ect.

The ZX14 has a 0-60 time of 2.5 seconds, top speed electronically limited to 299kph, which is slower than the DB9 but the bikes would be too far ahead before it reached its full potential, and then the Hayabusa absolutely obliterates the DB9 in top speed anyway. It's limited to 354kph, and a shade slower than the ZX14 in acceleration with a 0-60 of 2.6 seconds when concerning the latest model.

Single cylinder engines have a weighted flywheel or a harmonic balancer. Two or more Cylinder engines normally use a spacing in the crankshaft rod journals to allow other cylinders to continue the inertia. The "science" there is to divide the rotation of the crankshaft (360 degrees) by the number of cylinders in engine. That number is optimal for carrying the inertia, but isn't practical for the design of an in line or "v" style engine. It is, however, perfect for a radial design. A "v" style ends up with a slight lope and the "L" design normally ends up with opposing cylinders.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little?|`|sCv2GO9Maa	Is that a 4 stroke engine?<br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  How does the fuel get compressed if the crankshaft is being driven by the fuel? <br>  By the rotation of the caused by the other cylinder(s) in the timing order, or the rotational inertia from the originating force in one cylinder applications. <br>  <br>  Why does the fuel need to be ignited? Is it so it pushes the piston back down?<br>  Yes.

Have you got the key in - the ignition must be in the auxillary position for it to pop out using the paper clip method.<br>  <br>  If it's still not popping out then it could be that the steering lock mechanism is also at fault.

k3PPULbMaa	it depends how old the car is. Clio's built before 1998 did not have sunroof drain tubes, so if you clio is older than that it is more likely that the seal is faulty. After 1998 they had drain tubes, which you should be able to see by opening the sunroof and looking inside the sunroof mechanism through the opening. The best way of telling if they are blocked is to pour a measured amount of water down the tube opening located in the front corner of the sunroof mechanism and seeing if you get the same amount of water coming out of the darin tube, which is located behind the front wheels. on Clio's after 1998 the fitting that the sunroof drain pipe connected to had a habit of leaking water and making the roof lining wet, if that is the case you may need a new sunroof mechanism.

My steering pump has gone on my ford mondeo and i was giving a price for ￡279, thats all in. So sounds to me this garage your going to could be taking the mick abit. As for your clutch done a little bit of google research, looks as if its a very common problem, did they say its just the clutch cable gone or is it the clutch housing too? Found a couple prices people have paid and if its just the clutch cable then ive seen prices around the ￡180 mark. If its clutch housing as well then your looking at the ￡300 mark but ￡360 still seems a little over the top. <br>  My advise and i know you have spent a load on it, lose it, cut your loses and move on and dont get another punto. If you really cant do that then shop around as many garages as you can and try to haggle them.

Subsequent Spitfire designs changed that and the Spitfires of 1945, while still obviously a Spitfire, had no parts in common with the 1939 version, including the use of drop tanks when required.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Yes, but in practice, not often.  <br>  The Spitfire was designated for defense of Britain, while American fighters were designated escorts. The doctrine did not call for use of drop tanks. This is a general rule, since some spitfires were used for close support and recon when replaced by more modern variants in the interceptor role, and so had to carry extra fuel.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Yes they were.  Most versions were fitted for drop tanks at one time or another but they were seldom used as they were in horrendously short supply.  Certainly the PR Mk Vl was often fitted with them and the later Griffon-engined PR XlX was fitted for 170 gal tanks but in practice 90 gal tanks were the largest used.

KOXcw4klaa	i don't know what the weather is like where you live,but it sounds like moisture collected on your rotors and caused them to rust up.which is normal.when you take off and hit the breaks you will get a sound similar the the pads being down to metal.put the rust is removed via,hitting the brake pedal and the noise will go away.this is especially common on a car with 4 wheel disc brakes.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	If they are working ok now, then it's probably just through lack of use (like the other guy said).<br>  <br>   If they are down to the metal you'll get a grinding noise when you brake.<br>  <br>   Brakes getting brittle?

After the car has stood for two or three days, the brakes grind on initial use but the noise disappears after a few applications.<br>  <br>  As many others have said, it is probably due to rust/corrosion build up as the car stands idle and the noise is this rust layer being rubbed off. This could cause extra wear on the front disk pads and the rear linings so get them checked if they haven't been checked recently.|`|uzepqbXIaa	I would change the brake pads anyway.  They arent expensive and you know then you have another 20-30k miles before they will need changed again.<br>  <br>  If the old pads get brittle, they can break apart.  if you do wear them down to the metal, the disc is ruined too as metal to metal friction causes it to warp and melt.|`|AA10331789	Brake checks are typically free here in the USA, so if you trust the repair shop, you'll probably find out that the pads are not worn out and you can keep driving until the next brake check is due on your vehicle.

BGPa2DqYaa	I assume you mean "Renew"your registration(Tags)? If that's the case then you will receive your "Invitation" (That's what the renewal is called) approximately 45 days BEFORE it expires. Now, this bureau, through a very extensive pol determined that If you get this and send for it within 3 business days then you will receive the new sticker in plenty of time before the expiration. All bets are off If you wait 1 week. I like the convenience but the stringent rule bothers me. Of course if you go to the DMV with the invite and it is more then 7 to 10 days before, they will probably send you away. So, your choice is, do It right away or wait till your in the week of It expiring. Anything to make the consumer angry. So, If you just got It in the mail, just do it on line.

Q4O1v13Qaa	The Ford 5.4L's have been having this problem a lot. I found a link to TSB #06-15-2 that I had saved earlier, but I see it has been superseded by TSB 08-1-9, that I hadn't seen yet.

They have a left handed style thread looking groves that back out broken studs/bolts Etc like this job. Do not drill it out. That is a last resort effort thing to do if the threads are stripped out, which they are not.<br>  Good Luck.|`|KOXcw4klaa	well your best bet is to tap an easy out in it,heat it up and pray.of course you had to break off the one that's probably the hardest to get at!!|`|56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	Find a mechanic that has drilled them out before.<br>  You need an air compressor, 90 degree air drill, set of long drill bits, large set of easy outs, probably a torch to heat the remainder of the spark plug before using the easy outs. A blow gun with a long tube so you can blow out the cylinder after removing the spark plug. You may have to install a heli-coil if the threads are stripped in the head.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	I'm having a hard time understanding how the base of a plug broke apart, it's all one piece.

This has to be connected to the remote of your stereo if your stereo does not have a blue exposed remote wire then do the following: on the power cable (You have to pull out your stereo deck for this) you will see three wires, black, red, and yellow, jam the purple/red into the back of the red on the stereo, and tape it and make sure it does not touch anything else.<br>  <br>  if alls set up correctly, when you turn your ignition your amplifier will turn on, and when you take off your ignition the amp should turn off, if its constantly on disconnect and try again, because this will drain your car battery.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	There is usually a <br>  <br>  live wire - red and fused which goes to the + terminal on your battery<br>  <br>  ground wire -  which is black and connects to a metal part of the car<br>  <br>  blue wire - which is the trigger wire and connects to your head unit<br>  <br>  I would say the yellow is the live wire, the black is ground, and the thin wire is the trigger wire by the sounds of it.
SLcZatQBaa	I can't believe the crap I'm reading here.  THE OTHER END OF THE NEGATIVE CABLE IS ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE BLOCK ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE NEAR THE OIL FILTER, NOT THE CHASSIS.  Level 2 Ford guy needs to be dropped to level 0.  1987 through 1993 Mustang have ALWAYS had a bad reputation with their electrical systems.  This is where one of the "must-do" upgrades comes into play.  Switch over from your stock alternator over to a 1994/1995 5.0 alternator (130 amp) or a 1994 through 1999 V6 Mustang alternators (which is the same thing).  Once you do this swap all your drain problems go away.  Do not replace with OEM alternator from the parts stores when it comes to your alternator because they will only give you the same type of unit you are replacing.  One awesome source for this mod can be read about at the website I list below.  Oh, when reusing your stock alternator bracket you will have to grind it down in a certain spot to allow clearance for the larger 130 amp housing.  A 1998 GT like Kit is talking about is a totally different system so ignore him.  Your issue is different from his.<br>  <br>  The smaller wire coming off the negative is supposed to be connected to the frame right behind the battery.  Trace that smaller wire from the battery terminal and you should come into a connector.  The opposite end of that connector is a small segment of that same cable bolted to the frame.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can unbolt the NEG from the block.  Disconnect the POS terminal first before you do so.  As long as you keep the POS off the battery you're not hurting anything.|`|lIxEKA1xaa	well your cable should be going to the frame/body of the vehicle, mak sure its a good connection to teh frame (no rust). and the low power, you might need a new alternator, if that is still from the original engine, then the brushes inside could be worn down and may need a replacement. if ur enine is runnnign low. possibly the coil inside the alternator is putting too much current inside making it run hard.|`|O3qsmr82aa	Negative cable goes to chassis ground.  It wouldn't hurt to replace both cables.  (Disconnect the negative first).  Clean the battery terminals with a wire brush, the negative ground, and the threaded terminal on the starter solenoid, then coat lightly with Vaseline or Silicone Dielectric compound to prevent rust.  Then charge the battery.<br>  <br>  You can test the alternator by connecting a voltmeter to the battery terminals.  Voltage should be 12-13V when the engine is off, or 14.5V when its running.|`|OmcBziKVaa	Hey man, I drive a 98' GT and was experiencing a similar problem. I took the car into the shop, and $160 later they told my that the wire connection to the alternator was bad. This caused two issues: 1. The car wouldn't charge reliably, causing electrical equipment to react strangely. 2. In my car, it caused the on board CPU to think something fishy was a foot and the car went into "theft mode", meaning it ran like absolute crap at every light. They tightened up all the connections and I'm happy to say the thing runs awesome now.<br>  <br>  Make sure all your connections along the way are tight and secure before buying a bunch of parts you might not need. You could end up saving some cash. :)
3MTYGEbWaa	It's $55,147.<br>  <br>  What the question didn't make very clear is that the 32% is of the selling price, not the dealer's purchase price.

KOXcw4klaa	your rack could be going bad or your steering pump could be weak.just because the car is well maintained doesn't mean things wont break or wear out.when your going forward your rpms are much higher than when your backing up.which means the steering pump is not turning over as fast and that is why when your backing up it steers so much harder.

If the bikes have a batteries it could also really spoil your day !! I would go to Homedepot & check out the heavy duty shelving or build some if you can. They might have a set that you can leave the bottem set of shielves out to fit one bike under & then using a ramp put the other one on top. With a ramp I bet it would be easer to get it up there then it would be to pull a wheelie & stop just before crashing through the wall.  (LOL).Just remember the shielves  that you may have to remove below give the uprights their strength to keep them straight & hold them in place. You will need to make a few gussets to replace the shielves that are not installed.  <br>  To anwser your question mount the lawn mower to the wall for the week to see if it is able to cut the lawn after that.

QsJCUJohaa	The EGR Valve (Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve) aids in warming up the engine to operating Temperature.  The engine is designed for maxi mun efficiency and optimum power at a pre determined Temperature.<br>  <br>  If you are getting alot of engine noise or alot of smoke, the EGR valve isn't the problem.  And removing it may improve the condition some, however, your engine has other issues.<br>  <br>  The downside on removing it from a diesel engine is by lowering the heat generated to the cylinders, you reduce the engines ability to burn all of the fuel.  Diesel engine burn the fuel through compression and heat.... not spark.  So lowering the cylinder Temperature leaves fuel in the cylinder that is unburnt.  It will aid in lubrication to the cylinder but eventually may cause "wet stack".  The cylinders staying wet with unburnt fuel.  Over time, if enough fuel builds up, the engine may experience a hydraulic lock.|`|KOXcw4klaa	when i used to modify cars/trucks.build high performance engines,the first thing to go was the egr valve.some places or states require an emissions test even on diesels.so if you do decide to remove the egr vale keep it handy to put back on.|`|Ty32khkaaa	It will throw off the computer, and cause the check engine light to come on.

xYMjXqhZaa	Before you go throwing money and time into diagnostics and such, what was the outside temperature at the time of these occurrences?<br>  <br>          When the outside temperature is cold enough, the difference between that and your exhaust temperature will be sufficient to cause a "fog" effect. It might be that your white smoke may just be water vapor. If it does it again, jump out and run around back to take a sniff. If you have an issue with water in the engine, trust me. You'll smell it.|`|EmgiGg17aa	You did not mention anything about the air temperature before you got into the car.  Was it nippy, frosty, or hotter than the place "downstairs"?    If you can see your breath, you are going to see the car"s breath.  This is condensation from moisture inside the exhaust pipe/muffler.  That is why exhaust systems rust out.    It takes about 5 miles of driving to get all the moisture out of your exhaust.   Watch other car tailpipes (it is much easier than watching your own as you drive)  Some will smoke a whitish grey and some will smoke blue(oil burner), some black(choke is stuck on or diesel under load so the black is excess fuel burning in the exhaust pipe instead of the engine, and some won't show anything as the engines are warmed up long enough so that the moisture is out(but the cars are still giving off harmful CO2 and poisonous CO at the same rate as the visible smoke ones.

If you take in to account that good quality pads should run you about $100, rotors are about $75/ea plus labor.  Resurfasing rotors will save you money, but the labour is a little more than it would be for replacing them.   Most shops charge between $75-$120 for labor from our price compairing phone calls.

d5c72dc4adab680a19c78052d440383daa	A model year is not the same as calender year in most cases.  Some times, the calendar year could be almost one year ahead.  Take for example the 2010 RX350, it was released back in February (2009).  So, this is especially important when you consider the warranty on a used vehicle and how much time you have left.  If it's a 2007 model, but it registered back in say Oct. 2006, then the warranty starts then, so a 3 year warranty expires in Oct. 2009, whereas in mind, you might think "sometime" in 2010.<br>  <br>  To make a long answer short, as a rule of thumb, a model year usually starts the September of previous year to August of that year.  So 20007 model year is from September 2006 to August 2007.  Good luck shopping.|`|AA11609766	This may have to do with how car manufacturers produce the next year's car model the year before. Like, they will start selling 2007 model cars while it is still 2006, so I would guess that maybe the car was made before 2007, but is under the 2007 model.

mR5ZtjqWaa	Depends on the company. A big one, with lots of execs to move around operate almost like an airliner. The bizjet is flying hops constantly shuttling people to meetings at different places around the country.<br>  In other cases, a very long range flight or a smaller company for example, the pilots will stay at a hotel until the boss is ready to leave.|`|dWLgwb3baa	It really depends on the operation.  If you are talking about a true corporate operation, as opposed to charter, passengers rarely ever stay at a single location for more than a business day or two.  If the passengers are coming back the same day, the pilots usually wait at the airport.  On overnight trips, the pilots will generally be in the same city.<br>  <br>  There are trips, usually charter, where the passengers are away for extended business or pleasure trips.  In this case, several factors are weighed to see what makes the most sense, including the chance of the passenger's schedule changing, the operating cost of the airplane, and how long the trip is.  After all things are considered, the options are:<br>  1) Stay where the passengers are,<br>  2) Fly the plane back to home base so it is available for other passengers, or<br>  3) Keep the airplane where the passengers are, but the pilots fly home on airlines until they are needed again.<br>  <br>  Option 1 is the most common, but I have done both of the other options depending on the circumstances.|`|EDnT0y8caa	The answer to your question totally depends on the type of corporate operation it is. No two corporate flying jobs are exactly alike. The "fractional" companies with lots of planes and pilots operate more like airlines. One crew may drop off the passengers and the other may pick them up in a different airplane. In my job, a one-plane one-crew company-owned operation, with main offices on opposite ends of the country and clients in about 40 states. I usually wait while my passengers do whatever business they do. Sometimes I wait a few hours, other times a few days. It's usually far cheaper for the company to pay for hotels, meals and a rental car for the crew than to send the airplane back to base and have it come pick them up a few days later. The down side of this is that I sit around a lot more than I fly. The up side is that I sometimes get layovers in really nice places for several days. If several executives in the company I fly for need to get around the country on business over a period of weeks, quite often one exec will fly home comercially and the next one will fly out comercially to meet the company plane. Sometimes I'm on the road for 3 weeks at a time without ever getting home myself, yet I may only have the same group of passengers for only a few days at a time. Sometimes we leave the plane someplace on the other side of the country for a few weeks and the crew will fly home commercially and back to the plane when the company needs to use it again. They do this when a commercial round trip ticket for the  crew is cheaper than keeping them at a motel for an extended period.

vtul2lc1aa	Slow down a little before you start going off on a wild tangent from these answers. First of all the starter and the parts that make it go are very simple pieces of equipment. From what you have said through the entire explanation of your experience I would say the following. The starter has a drive mechanism built in that powers the starter motor only after it has been excited by the ignition switch. When you turn the ignition switch to the start position it energizes a device called the starter solenoid. On some cars this is a magnetic coil that pulls in a switch mounted remotely and powers the starter motor. On your car the soleniod is mounted on the starter and actually engages the starter drive to the engines flywheel at which point the starter drive hits a switch in the starter and powers the starter motor. A click without a start usually means the starter drive is not working properly. A start after several tries is almost positively confirmation of this. A starter that continues to stay engaged and running after the key is reased to the run position is deffinate confirmation that the starter drive is hanging up which is usaully caused by the starter solenoid sticking. You can buy just a starter soilenoid and replace it but since this still involves removing the starter I would suggest replacing the entire unit with a rebuilt one from your local auto parts store. Buy the way if you buy a rebuild buy the lifetime unit. There is a difference. The life time unit is completely reworked and is as good as a new one but at about a 1/4 of the price. The cheaper or one year warrented unit is only repaired by replacing the obvious issues cleaned, painted and sold. Not a good deal 90% of the time.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	The starter can't run without power.

3Wxx2FPkaa	Fleet management is the management of a company's vehicle fleet. Fleet management includes commercial motor vehicles such as cars, vans and trucks. Fleet (vehicle) management can include a range of functions, such as vehicle financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicle telematics (tracking and diagnostics), driver management, fuel management and health & safety management. Fleet Management is a function which allows companies which rely on transportation in their business to remove or minimize the risks associated with vehicle investment, improving efficiency, productivity and reducing their overall transportation costs, providing 100% compliance with government legislation (duty of care) and many more. These functions can be dealt with by either an in-house fleet-management department or an outsourced fleet-management provider. According to market research from the independent analyst firm Berg Insight, the number of fleet management units deployed in commercial fleets in Europe will exceed 1 million next year. Even though the overall penetration level is just a few percent, some segments such as road transport will attain adoption rates above 30 percent.<br>  <br>  Fleet management also refers to the management of ships or aircraft types, while at sea or in the air. Ships are normally given to fleet management companies that handle aspects like crewing, maintenance, and day-to-day operations. This gives the ship owner time to concentrate on cargo booking.<br>  <br>  Fleet data refers to tail numbers assigned to an aircraft, while in case  of cars fleet data is maintained by its number plates.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Fleet Management is to control the overall cost of operating and maintaining a fleet of vehicles and equipment, to maintain vehicles and equipment in a manner that extends their useful life, to control the growth in size of the fleet, to standardize the composition of the fleet and to accurately budget for maintenance and replacement costs.

You would need to plan your consumption accordingly.<br>  <br>  The device you need is called a charge controller, and you can get it from various solar dealers.  Given the size of your battery bank, it's probably best to wire it as 12 volts.  To get 110 AC out of it, you need to buy and connect an inverter.<br>  <br>  If the batteries are already charged, and all you want to do is maintain them (for example, golf cart batteries in storage), then disregard most of what I said above.  You can just get a charge controller.  But you won't be able to charge the batteries back up once you drain them.

qO5xm5BSaa	no offense but not really much of a system, but hey we all have had to start somewhere, my opinion, id look on ebay and get a good deal on some used equipment, for a starter system i would not buy that new, if you look on ebay you could probably get just as good as that for about a third the price, do not buy **** from a audio store, for example at a local audio store where i live i couldve got a 1000 watt kicker zx for 800 dollars, got it on ebay brand new 260........so on and so on|`|cGSJDg2laa	not reaaly good....but i think you should go for kicker nice brand and good...i wouldnt get none of the stuff you named,,sorry..|`|LJ3wwm4uaa	it depends on what you want to do with your sound system...do you want it just for you, do you want to blow the guy next to you away at a stop light? it's all personal preferance|`|D7ikv9Zaaa	I agree with the fist answer.

BGPa2DqYaa	It seems to me you should know these things.After all whatever State you reside in and maybe hold there drivers license this should be on the written test. Well, lets see: the word "Yield" means give up your right to some action. right of way means, you may have HAD the right of way, like "Right on Red" you MUST give up that right when entering this intersection. (This is only one example)Another and more importantly: Your driving and along comes an "Emergency vehicle"(Fire Truck-Ambulance,Etc) Whatever the prevailing road signs MIGHT indicate. You now give this right up to "Yield" to this vehicle. Good Luck|`|AKq7t9dNaa	that means to stop and let the others go|`|sVhwN7Lsaa	it means stop if there is a car coming from any where than after that car goes you can go good luck
AA12265870	Those trucks have an internal ABS relay that sticks on and kills the battery.In the underhood fuse box,pull the fuse for the ABS and see if it quits.If so,you'll need a new EBCM which is the black box mounted on the inside of the left frame rail.The EBCM actually mounts to the Brake Pressure Modulator Valve which has all the brake lines running to it.The EBCM has torq screws holding it to the BPMV and get filled with dirt and hard to get at. If you dont want to spend the money on the EBCM,you can leave the fuse out and your base brakes will still work.The ABS light will also be on in the dash when you pull the fuse.|`|AKduP9cDaa	Since your truck has no voice in the matter, I would assume it's Humming in the rain.

g6easyBFaa	Engine flooding on Wankel Rotary engines always has been an issue and always will be. It is simply a limitation of the rotary design.<br>  <br>   Because of the shape of the rotary housing it can allow unburnt fuel to pool at the bottom. This little bit of gas can thin the layer of oil on the housing. This causes a loss of sealing between the apex seal and the housing. Without this seal you lose compression and it becomes very difficult to start the car.<br>  <br>   The excess fuel is common because all cars run "rich" fuel mixtures when you first start it. As the engine warms up fuel flow is reduced to normal levels.<br>  <br>   So if you start a rotary engine and shut it off before the engine warms up you could end up with excess unburnt fuel and a flooded engine. So always let the motor warm up for a few minutes before shutting if off.<br>  <br>   The change in engine programming Mazda made cuts back fuel quicker but you can still flood if you shut off the motor after only a minute or so.|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	Yes in the owners manual are specific instructions on start up (cold, hot and for flooded conditions).<br>  Read them and follow them.<br>  One thing that I have read is that the sequence for turning off the engine that is often over looked by new owners. The requirement for this is short and sweet - Make sure the engine has returned to low idle before turning the engine off!|`|YKt4uxoWaa	Greetings Lady Delita,<br>  <br>  Congratulations on owning a very unique car, one that should please you with very long life and simple maintenance. As a fellow owner of a wankel rotary car (mine is a 1987 Mazda RX-7), I've flooded my car a few times too. It's no big deal, everyone does it at least once.<br>  <br>  To prevent flooding every time, as soon as it starts, wait 10-15 minutes before shutting it off. Warm-up is mandatory on a cold engine and is the key to long engine life. My grandpa had a 1974 RX4, purchased new, and it would stall out if you tried to drive it before it had warmed up. But with care, he managed to get it to 375,000 miles with basic maintenance. Check the oil once a week, add as necessary, warm it up before driving on every cold start and take it to redline every week is the magic formula!<br>  <br>  www.rx8club.com has plenty of info specific to your car. Also, www.rx7club.com has info as well, but it's tailored to RX7's. Despite that, you'll find some helpful articles in the FAQs there.<br>  <br>  your friend and fellow rotary owner,<br>  Travis<br>  <br>  PS. If you have any more questions, I'm more than happy to help out as much as I can.
Rwn0svq0aa	The changes are evolutionary. The new Mazda 3 comes with a larger and more fuel efficient 2.5 litre engine. Horsepower is increased by 10 -15 bhp and overall fuel mileage is increased by 5%.  The undercarriage has a horizontal brace that provides stiffer body construction, to encourage better handling. The center face dials for controls has more precise electrical dial applications over the previous economy laden mechanical dials.  The front air dam has a Mazda trademark smile to better increase air into the engine.  I believe this version of the  Mazda 3 now comes with a dual exhaust instead of the single exhaust pipe. The plastic fit and finish with the interior surfaces are improved, a more upscale feel.  If not now, in the near future, Mazda has a stop start feature to improve miles per gallon.  Mazda claims that the system is one of the faster applications in the market, making it un-noticeable to the driver.  And eventually, the Mazda 3 will have a red LED light on the drivers side rear view mirror that will make an audible sound when a car is in the driver's blind spot. The catalytic converter is a break through in nanotechnology, it will substantially reduce green house emissions from the exhaust.|`|AA10788612	No major changes since 2004, but the 2010 has received a complete overhaul & new engine.
gEw83TRTaa	You're not prone to hyperbole at all, are ya...<br>  <br>  There are a couple of ways to do it.  One, is the way the first answer said, by giving a bill of sale and sending the title along when it comes.<br>  However, most buyers will be very nervous about that.<br>  <br>  Another way - if the bank holding the car title has a local office, you can tell them in advance that you are selling the car.  They will send the title to the local office.  You take your buyer with you to the bank, hand them the money and get the title on the spot.  <br>  <br>  If the bank does not have a local branch, you can get their title department on the phone.  Tell them you are selling the car.  Have the buyer send payment directly to the bank, and the bank send title directly to the new owner.  <br>  <br>  In all three cases, you need a bill of sale simply stating that you no longer own the car.  You should make sure that you include a statement that the car is sold AS IS.  The only I include typically says - "Vehicle is sold AS IS, WHERE IS, with no warranties or guarantees expressed or implied."  That is pretty much iron clad and the buyer cannot claim you promised them anything.|`|2eEiKevEaa	A vehicle is only "worth" what someone is willing to pay for it. If and when you sell the car, a bill of sale alone will not protect you from liability in the event the new owner has an accident. You must file a release of liability form with the DMV.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I have tried looking this up online in a million places. We have a Chevy that is worth about 4700. I'm trying to sell it for 4800. We owe about 4400. So we are trying to make a couple hundred in profit.<br>  ---------------<br>  <br>  <br>  No buyer with even a lick of brains will give you more than the vehicle is worth, since a lender will only give loan value.<br>  <br>  In other words, you need to scrape up a few hundred bucks to get this done.|`|DyEIc0K8aa	You give them a bill of sale, you sign it, they sign it (be sure you keep a copy), when they pay for the car. Now the buyer owns the car and if they get in an accident and have not put insurance on it, their problem. And yes you can get insurance without the title, I have done it several times. Of course you are required to produce the title ASAP, they need it to get plates for the car..
Gn0nR2S1aa	You basically answered your own question. Labor rates vary in different locations, the dollar amount could be anywhere from 60 to 95 depending on where you live. To replace a module would take at least an hour to change. Best advice is to simply call them and ask for an estimate.|`|CDbzfSGhaa	Call around for prices, go with the medium price usually the cheapest would be an un certified mechanic of course this could be a GM dealer repair because of the computer in the car. Dealers have the highest labor but all the mechanics are trained by the manufacture, certified mechanics would follow in the labor charges, backyard mechanics or some independent shops will be cheaper but may not use good parts or may not fix the right problem so you end up getting more fixed that needed, spending more esp. with a computer related repair.|`|VYdNVejiaa	My advice would be to look on web sights like Angie's list or  Craig's list. Sometimes you can find a mechanic who is not working right now and can do the work for a lot less.
KOXcw4klaa	i have restored old cars for a long time.yes the 6v system sucks.most have the system converted over to the 12v.but if your just gonna start the car with 12v then have it run on a 6v battery then it should not harm a thing.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Test the output on the generator. If it is like 14 volts, it is a 12 volt system. If not it is probably 6. You can convert those easily. Just get a 12 volt generator, and be ready to change out blinker relays, and light bulbs as they go from the extra power. Just replace them with 12 volt parts. You are not causing harm really, just a little extra wear and tear on the electrical system from the extra power.|`|vvgw5MBTaa	Yes, I'm surprised the ignition system hasn't failed.  Maybe the electrical system has been changed to 12V.  When driving in the demo derby we used to put 24V to a 12V starter, but only to the starter, not the to the distributor.<br>  <br>  ???|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Nothing happens because you need to join the other 2 terminals together on the 6 volt and the 12 volt and then you have 18 volts to start and she will fly over on the starter.You wont do any harm starting the car like this but once started you should run on 6 volt
cAMdBtFQaa	Unfair....<br>  The current gov value for use of a private vehicle is 0.52/mile driven, plus reimbursement for toll.  YOU are paying to take them back to Boston.<br>  At minimum, I would require them to pay the total expense, if you wanted to actually cover the use of your vehicle,  would charge the government rate of 52 cents a mile.  The other thing, use mileage both ways, you didn't say if you were going to Boston also.<br>  If you are sharing the ride and all 3 of you are heading there, then they are still being unfair, they should be covering 2/3 of the cost which appears to be about $25.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Just keep it simple.  They said they would help out with gas, so when you stop to fill up gas, say "would you guys mind picking up the gas" and let them pay for it.  That will avoid any awkwardness.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	It's really hard getting people to pay 52 cents a mile, lol, that includes wear&tear and depreciation and that's too much to ask.  <br>  <br>  If you were going to Boston anyway, then I'd say split fuel and tolls 1/3.  <br>  <br>  If you are going solely as a favor to them, then figure round trip costs (even though THEY are going one way, YOU have to pay to come back) and ask each to pay half. <br>  <br>  If they don't like it, <a href="http://www.mbta.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbta.com/</a>|`|H7LZg5z0aa	I think that it is good that they gave you something even though it isn't enough.  But, consider that you are going there yourself and that, if they weren't along, you would have to pay all the expenses yourself.  So, you save a little with what they have given you.<br>  <br>  If future occurrences arise, tell the party that you can only do it if they pay half, up front, for the trip.  If they cannot, so be it.  They will have to find another ride.|`|u4ejOAwTaa	Well there are few ways of looking at this.<br>  <br>  You could split the cost, i.e. $37 split three ways.<br>  <br>  Or, you could charge them just a little bit less than they would have paid getting the coach etc, they still save money. This is a bit mercenary though, and it would be awkward spening 3 hours with them.<br>  <br>  Or you could argue that you were going to Boston anyway, so they should ride for free, as you offered it to them. It would have cost you $37 (maybe a small bit for gas because of the extra weight).<br>  <br>  But to be honest, unless you agreed on a price beforehand, they are OK to assume it was free, as you would have still paid for tolls and gas and any money they do give you (including that $15) is actually a nice gesture.
AA12261615	at the rear of the vehicle there's a plug that comes apart and if you go to advance or auto zone either one they sell a wiring kit that just plugs right in to it and then you plug your original plug back in to it and then your done,it comes with all the wires necessary and this way you don't cut any wires at all on it,i got one on my truck an it took less than 2 minutes to install it,its the best system they ever came out with,follow the harness back and you,ll see where they plug together at,that's the point that you hook the new plug in to it at,good luck with it,

uDuwc7Yoaa	rather than a tune-up, i'd be more worried about belts, hoses, gaskets etc being dry and subject to cracking and leaks. also, the battery might need to be charged, but of course it it starts your car right up then it's fine.<br>  The oil needs changing after that long, also the gas may be bad.<br>  So do a once over inside your engine to see if anything looks drier than normal. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell if things are going to leak until they actually start leaking. good luck|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	well you can type into search box <br>  how to do tune up  2005 Honda civic <br>   really been sitting a long time  fuel will need to be replace and battery <br>  you could type how to start a car that has been stored really fuel and battery check your tire rest should be just like you left it|`|AHHAGxlCaa	hiya<br>  <br>  I would take the car and have a service<br>  <br>  oil replacement<br>  air filter replacement<br>  fuel filter replacement<br>  engine tune<br>  tyre pressure check<br>  battery may need a charge<br>  <br>  check brakes they could be a little stiff<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  and keep up the good work xx
jeEEVXaLaa	In Australia, in NSW a greenslip is what we call the Compulsory Third Party Insurance that must be purchased in order to register your vehicle. You can purchase a greenslip from one of the 5 different insurance companies.|`|BGPa2DqYaa	In California the "Green Slip" takes the place of the Title document. This goes back to the Old Days before titles. It was a common thing to "drag race" your vehicle and when you Lost turn over your Green Slip and that meant you lost your car. I believe that all states now have a title document that must be transferred like everybody else and the term is still used. Titles have been the document of record since 1972. All vehicles prior to that used the registration document-Green Slip.
AA12103453	How big is the book there? When I live the driver's manual isn't that long, and the tests are pretty easy. The thing is you can't just study one part or another. They try to pick questions out of the book at random basically, so that they can see that you looked through it all. To be honest though they are mostly common sense. Things like identify what a sign means, and how you should react in certain situations. They are multiple choice where I am, and you can always eliminate 1 or 2 answers just from how far off they are.

NRtqNelmaa	It sounds like the possibility of a fuel starvation problem. Easiest thing to do is replace the fuel filter and see if that helps. If not have the fuel pump flow and pressure checked>|`|QsJCUJohaa	When is the last time you did a tune up??  Commonly on Tritons I see two performance problems.  Easy to fix, but expensive.<br>  <br>  <br>  First are the spark plugs... the factory plugs have one electrode and one ground.  They have a tendancy to short ot and break off the ceraminc and fall into the cylinder.  The new style plug has a "cup" design that not only keeps the ceramic from falling into the cylinder if it breaks off, but it provides two grounds for the electrode.  The new HT-15 plugs cost around $23 each<br>  <br>  The second issue is air flow I reccommend changing the air filter at least every 20000 miles and more often if you drive under dusty conditions frequently.  A K&N filter (oil charged) can actually help the Tritons breath better, Just like a sprinter... if they have a cold and can breath; they can't perform.|`|KOXcw4klaa	could be the computer is programed to not let the truck go over a certain speed.you don't specify how old the truck is.but your best bet is to bring it to a ford dealer.
KOXcw4klaa	first off.there is no guarantee it wont break down again.no matter what you do.if the timing chain/belt did break and the engine is an interference one(meaning the valves can come in contact with the pistons if not timed right)then your looking at pos bent,broken valves.or even a hole in the piston.if there is no interference fit.then you could probably just put in a new chain and go from there.so get outside and start pulling the engine apart to see what damage is done.get an estimate on what it will cost to repair it compared to getting a used engine and or junking the thing,buying something else.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Is this an old 1.3 Fiesta or a newer one?<br>  <br>  Fourteen year old Fiesta, just scrap it, it'll never be worth repairing. You could pick a complete identical car up for around ￡200.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	The car is 14 years old and it,s about time you had a new one|`|Ty32khkaaa	Of course it is possible, you can fix anything. The question would be, is it worth it? It all depends on what kind of damage was caused when it broke. Sometimes the piston will come up and hit one or more valves, damaging them. If that happened be ready to replace the engine, or do a thorough rebuild. How fast was the car going when the timing chain went? If it was fast you can bet that there is internal damage, but if not you might be able to put it back on and go. If it were me, I would put a new chain on, and see if it will run. If there is damage you will know right away.|`|xZnEOJeBaa	You can replace the car for less than it would cost to repair this one.|`|k5QKmP1caa	get a timing chain put back on towing and cost 200.00|`|FOovSpAOaa	I think the best bet will be to replace your car because i had this problem in my corsa but i just got a newer engine fitted quite cheaply. A timing chain costs ￡100 for a new one, it requires alot of work because the engine has to be lifted out and then the timing chain is replaced. The likely hood of it breaking again is quite high as well, so in the long run just scrap the car and buy another one.|`|xjE49FFaaa	A <br>  timing chain should never break it was probably not enough oil to lubricate it.

AA12265870	First off,your engine is distributorless ignition.It has a crank sensor that tells the ignition control module and the computer when to fire the plugs and the injectors.You should go back to basics and check for spark and fuel pressure.Take one of your old plugs and stick it in one of the easy to get to plug wires and make sure the metal body of the plug is grounded to the engine.Crank the engine and watch for spark.Next,check for fuel pressure.You really need a gage,it should be 42-50 psi. with the key in the run position.When you turn the key to run,a relay runs the fuel pump for 2 seconds to prime the system.<br>  The trouble with all this is,if you have a theft problem,you may not get the fuel pump to run or spark to the plugs.Hopefully you dont have that.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Don't do the stupid thing and hold screwdrivers around this electrical stuff...unless you want to see how quickly how upwards of 100,000 volts knocks you on your A$$!|`|xYMjXqhZaa	Distributor ignition module doesn't cost that much. It fits in the distributor where the points and condenser would be in an older engine, if it's the one I'm thinking about. <br>  <br>         If not, check with your local NAPA or Autozone and they can show you a picture of what it is and where it goes.|`|ECGzxPF5aa	You should check for spark before throwing parts at it. On older cars the ignition module was located inside the distributor cap, under the rotor. On newer cars with more complicated ignition systems, the control module was located elsewhere sometimes bolted to a valve cover. <br>  To check for spark, you can buy a tester or do it the back alley way. You need to be in a dark area when you do this. Pull one of the spark plug wires off and stick a screw driver inside the boot. Hold the screwdriver near the engine block or a bracket so the metal is close and have some one crank the engine. Look for sparks between the screwdriver and the other piece of metal being careful not to touch the metal. The spark should be consistent. No spark means a good chance it's your ecm. A mechanic could do further tests to diagnose this, but at that point you could take a chance and change it. Otherwise, if you have spark, the ecm is good and you have a different problem.|`|2443b235f2f0711e9a4e23b054575479aa	yes if it not fireing, this should do the job, but if money is tight, i belive you should look into a use one, may be at a wrecking yards, find one of you year, an if it been wreck, you know   they was driveing it , ,|`|D6t6SoFRaa	Is the security light flashing?

dQrBlk4qaa	First off - Jeeps and no alignment? NONSENSE. Jeeps need alignment, just like every other vehicle. In fact, look up "death wobble" and realize how important alignments are to jeeps (one of the major causes of death wobble is poor alignment).<br>  <br>  When your ABS is coming on, it is symptomatic of a problem with the anti-lock brakes. Most of the time it is a misreading ABS sensor at one of the wheels - there's a pickup and a reluctor, and most of the time the reluctor has gone defective, the wiring's damaged, or its bent away from the reluctor. Try checking on those first.
KOXcw4klaa	i think you need not worry about the color of the car being black.if you wash the car properly or have it professionally washed,then scratches wont be a problem.i bought a new car that was black and i was very careful at washing and waxing it.and never had a serious problem.as for the temp thing.well in the cold the car will be a bit warmer sitting outside in the sun and in the warmer weather it can get extremely hot inside.so your best bet is to find shade to park the car in or at least leave the windows opened a little.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	I have a black car and scratches do show.<br>  But hey, I also own a blue car and scratches show too.<br>  They show on everything except silver and white, which get dirty easily.<br>  But one good about black is that you can buy a cheap touch up paint and you really wont be able to tell the difference between that and the original color, so you can cover them easily.|`|uzepqbXIaa	sunlight will heat dark colours more.  you will find a black car will be too hot to touch if its in the sun.  This will effect the long term life of the paint and laquer.  in hot climates, white and silver cars are usually a more sensible choice.  But if you want a black car, you are perfectly allowed to get one lol.  Just keep it well waxed and covered from the sun if you can when its not used.|`|4QdiXs03aa	If you are that worried about looks, any dark car will show minor imperfections more than a medium to light colored car. It is much the same with the heat issue, as a dark car can easily run 30-40 degrees higher than medium to light vehicles if parked directly in the sunlight.

6DQ8LzxFaa	Which model of CVR did you get, the dual 2-ohm coils or the dual 4-ohm coils? That will tell you which you can do. I will assume you bought a pair. The dual 2's can be wired into a 0.5-ohm load or a 2-ohm load; the dual 4's can be wired into a 1-ohm or a 4-ohm load. The ZX500.1 is rated at 500x1@2-ohms. At a 4-ohm load, it probably puts out 250 watts. If you have the dual 2-ohm coil subs, wire them into a 2-ohm load, and each sub will get 250 watts.<br>    I would have bought the 2-ohm subs, and a ZX750.1 amp. <br>  <br>    You can't tell which way it is wired (2-ohm vs. 4-ohm) by listening to it. It sounds the same. The difference is how much power the amp puts out.

d9ECb7N8aa	For the Transmission:<br>  <br>  First, check to see that your brake lights are working. This will tell you that your brake pedal switch is still functioning properly.<br>  <br>  Next, turn the key on (so the radio, heater fan, ect) comes on. Turn the radio and fan off, now press and release the brake pedal slightly; you should hear a solenoid clicking as you press the pedal... If you do not hear the clicking, the solenoid could be bad, or you have faulty wiring to/from the solenoid. If you can hear it, then there is a mechanical jam or failure in the shifter assembly. There is also the chance of a jammed trans, but I haven't come across that one.<br>  You could also disconnect the shift cable from the transmission, and shift it out of park by hand (make sure parking brake is set and works properly).<br>  <br>  For not starting:<br>  The common point with the shifter and not starting is the ignition switch in the steering column. This could have broke internally or melted (do you have a lot of keys on your key ring?). <br>  <br>  If all electrical accessories are energized when the key is turned on (radio ect) then the park-lock solenoid (mentioned above) should work as well.<br>  <br>  The ignition switch may not be sending a signal to the starter to 'start'. You can jump the starter with a small piece of wire by going from the large terminal where the battery connects, to the smaller terminal near it on the starter. This will engage the starter. If the starter works, then you have a problem with the ignition switch or the wiring from the switch to the starter.|`|dr7r3rtCaa	I may have an idea of the "stuck" in park, it may be jammed, whens the last time you ran it, my cousins car did that, it was the gears in the tranny...|`|88bc02e78f8af966df066d8b6c93da26aa	The netural saftey swicth could be bad check that. it on the side of the tramission

O3qsmr82aa	You have a few options to relieve the fuel pressure.  The fuel pressure release valve is a scrader valve on the fuel line under the hood, (looks like your tire air valve).  Be careful because it will spray fuel.<br>  <br>  Also there's a fuel pump switch, or "inertia switch" located somewhere, (its in the trunk on a Mustang).  It shuts off the fuel in case there's a collision.  If you locate it, disconnect the electrical connector and start the engine and let it run til it stops.  This releases the fuel pressure.  When you're finished working, plug the electrical connector back into the switch and push the reset button on top of the switch.<br>  <br>  You may also pull fuel pump fuse and crank the engine over to release the fuell pressure.

He'll be getting a trac fone the evening of March 17, when his next payment is due.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Worst case scenario is a repossession and the lender filing a lawsuit against you to recover the money.<br>  <br>  Sell the car before it gets to this point. Dump the payments on your terms not the lender.|`|AA10788612	Then the finance company may have no choice but to repo it. That will damage your credit really bad. I suggest you double your efforts on getting employed or ask a relative for some help. If they due come knocking for the keys, don't fight the repo man. They're just doing their job as you would do yours. Start working with the finance company asap on Monday. Maybe they would be willing to extend it. Who knows.|`|dyQaEaXPaa	You need to pay it.  Protect your credit, it will save you lots of $$ in the end.  Do what ever you can.  If they repo it, you'll have no way to get to your next job, and most well-paying jobs require you to have reliable transportation.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	You lose it,unless they are willing to work with you.I'm in the same position only my loan company only gave me one month.So I am selling furniture and other things to try to get by.We need to get on welfare so we can own a few things.|`|iqMPvr7Taa	. Their not going to take hit and miss payments. They will repo it. They will sell the car for pennies on the dollar.Apply what they get to the loan. Then they will bill you for the difference, plus repo and auction or disposal fees.<br>  <br>  <br>  They will send a demand letter with the total owed.You will have a period of time to pay it like 30or60 days.<br>  <br>  If you don't pay they will sue and win. <br>  Giving it back doesn't relieve you of the debt.<br>  <br>  Then they will garnish wages or attach assets until paid off.<br>  <br>  And  it will be on your credit approx 7 years........md
tBq6ZDZvaa	Not really its more like a generic cover that's maid to fit allot of different seats so the end result is a seat cover that looks like you just threw a blanket over the seat. The custom ones will fit the seat perfect and will look better.|`|Og3vKQeWaa	no they are very bad fitting, that's why they are cheap!
5XFGNmVuaa	There really is no benefit to  warming a car up , especially when the outside temperature is well above freezing.  But you are correct in that starting off fast and furious as soon as it starts is hard on the car.  The best approach is to simply start off immediately and slowly.  Not only is this better for the car, but it's also the safest and you're not wasting fuel unnecessarily.  Of course, some cars just get cantankerous as they age, and warming up may be necessary before it will even move.|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	No, you don't "warm up" your enging.  That said, when it is cold out you don't just start it up and hop on the interstate either.|`|kSkMuc8laa	I agree with Alex M. but don't warm it up for to long because ive heard that it is actually not good for your car to just sit and idal for long periods of time but since you only warm it up for 2-3 you are ok.  i believe its after about 5 min will it actually start to be harmful.  but im not sure how true that is i live in kKentuckyand when i start my car i let it sit for 30 sec to a min then start driving.|`|7ONMCI74aa	i agree with you 100% i always warm any vehicle or piece of equipment i operate for a few minutes. i also check the oil and coolant every morning before starting. i guess that is just something i picked up from my grandfather growing up on a farm in nc. it seems to take me a little longer to warm up a venezuelan woman.|`|PRx6j6YQaa	by warming up your car the only think you are doing is wasting gas
tBq6ZDZvaa	Its normal the engine will idle high when its cold that's just the computer raising the idle to make the car warm up faster. Once your car warms up the idle will drop down to normal its happens to every car. Four cylinders are especially high when they are cold they go up to 2,000 RPM's at idle if the weather is cold enough. My car is a V6 and the highest its ever gone was about 1,700 RPMs ( its was about 10 degrees out side) than it dropped down to its normal 800 rpm idle once it warmed up.|`|RiQA4Epraa	the idle speed should be higher when you first start it<br>  its to help warm up the car|`|jyXUm4YQaa	that is normal on alot of cars if ithas a carb  you can adjust the idle down a couple hundred rpms|`|7tYUyfliaa	You may have to have the idle valve adjusted.

Through it took some gas with a heavy foot. This is a bad time to sell it  I think.Unless  You find an avid collector.If you live in the southern states where no salt has been used and do not live close to the oceans  .You would have  a good chance for a good sale

wMNRBpMCaa	Depends on the car you have, what is it? I doubt very seriously you would want to haul this little dirt bike filled with oil and possibly gas around in your car. Get a cheap 300 dollar trailer to haul it.

kVWio4sOaa	Scion xB.<br>  <br>  The xB2 is a far more sophisticated, roadworthy, and  fun to drive vehicle, plus it's a known entity.  Although not the block that the original xB was (thankfully), the xB2 is sleek while retaining a unique personality.<br>  <br>  The Cube is brand new and bound to have some bugs that need to be worked out.

If they are both the most recent, (2nd Generation), then I guess I prefer the XB because it doesn't look like it's supposed to be transporting goods like a semi truck would. It also has more horsepower, and is slightly larger. Plus it gets one whole MPG more than the cube.

AA12339318	Front wheel drive is marginally better in snow than rear wheel drive vehicles.  A car can get better traction and steering control pulling itself along than by pushing it's mass from behind.|`|KwY0EveSaa	FWD suvs do good in the snow. they do good because the front wheels are the main wheels controlling the car, so when they have all the power over the car in FWD, you have a better chance driving in the snow. FWD suvs have less chance of getting stuck in snow, and you have an easier time parking in the snow with FWD.|`|6uOBkvXRaa	It depends on where you live and what kind of driving conditions you drive in.  most FWD vehicles only have one drive wheel if you loose traction you are stuck also 100% of you torque is transmitted to that wheel which can cause it to loose traction sooner. 4WD SUV's can be purchased as either FWD/4WD or RWD/4WD depending make and model.  Some SUV can also be purchased with limited slip or locking rear differentials, and some have a hi/low range drive system.<br>  <br>  When driving in 4WD with open differentials, torque is applied to one front tire and one rear tire, this reduces the amount of torque to each tire which helps with traction.<br>  <br>  Traction in the snow is also dependent on the type of tires you have.<br>  <br>  As you know 4WD is your best choice.  while FWD will go in the snow to a point, 4WD will keep going long after the FWD is stuck.  Having 4WD is also much more relaxing to drive in the snow.  By having traction on one left and one right tire (ie left front/right rear) the SUV will track straighter and be more resistant to spinning out.<br>  <br>  we have a FWD car and a 4WD truck, when it snows we park the car and only drive the truck.  <br>  <br>  A word of caution, while 4WD will give you better traction once you hit your brakes it wont help you. <br>  <br>  the difference between driving a FWD and 4WD could be a long cold walk in the snow.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|oM420kqRaa	Depends on how much traction you need. The front wheel drive systems are good because the engine is over the front wheels and puts more weight on them giving you more traction. But if you are in a state that gets a lot of snow you will be better off with four wheel drive since it is more likely that you will lose more than just front wheel traction in deep snow.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	Four wheel drive is so overrated.  Its useless past 25 MPH anyway.  Plus you gotta carry that extra drivetrain and take on that crappy gas mileage even when NOT using four wheel drive.  You want to get through the snow then invest in a very good set of snow tires.  They will do a lot more than ANY four wheel drivetrain.
