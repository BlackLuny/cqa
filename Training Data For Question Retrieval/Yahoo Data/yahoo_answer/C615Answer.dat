FxhTgVg8aa	A lot of girls do stuff like that for fun. But as your question asks, if you can talk to her without it getting akward when your talking to her say something like "oh yeah, I bet your boyfriend would like that. Its fool proof. She will ethier say I don't have one. Or yeah. If your not comfortable doing that you should try something like watching her actions around guys; if she flirts she's ethier single or a ****. If she doesn't than she ethier might not want to date right now or she's not single.|`|6msoPLqQaa	does she hug a guy at school everyday? is she with a guy a lot? if so, then yes    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|BOgfHEqqaa	Ask her friends!|`|38l8GnItaa	well since valentines day is coming up, ask her wut she's doing for it casually.  she'll mention her man if she has one.  hope this helps! :)|`|fkgmmttoaa	flirt. if she says something like "dude, that's really nice of you, but i'm taken" or something, done !!

ScHW4842aa	Personally, i think your ex husband is nuts.     Tell him to punish his daughter another way. What kind of idiotic parent would do something detrimental to their child's school grades. This is not an issue of punishment. He could have done something else to punish her. But that?  wow - i understand why youre not with him.     Good on you. Ground your daughter - not make her grades suffer!|`|pg5r8kuxaa	i would have bought her the stuff she needs to do well in school.  just because she has misbehaved doesn't mean u should punish her by making her not be able to do her work.  you would get mad if she didn't do it when she was supposed to so why  tell her she cant?  if she wants to do her work let her do her work there are not to many kids that do want to do their work.  that is no way to punish a kid.|`|C4N3TM3maa	i think you did the right thing. you daughter needs those things for her education then you should help her maybe what she did wasn't so bad as what your ex has said. and he should want her to do good for school so i don't see why he would take the things she needs to continue to be a good student|`|pl96lkzIaa	I think what you did is right, and what your ex did is definitely wrong.  You should not punish your kids by withholding something they need, like school supplies.  If she misbehaved, he should have punished her some other way.  I think he should reimburse you for the supplies you bought, because he was WAY out of line.  Letting her get a bad grade is not an appropriate punishment, because it could affect her chances of getting into college or getting scholarships.|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Materials for school work is not a luxury, but a necessity, and has no business being used as part of a punishment. It sounds to me like your ex-husband put YOU in a bind, not her. After all, you had to run to the store, and the $15 came out of your pocket.    You did what you should have done as a responsible parent, but keep in mind that something else is going on here with him. Pay attention to what's going on and be sure not to let him use her again to punish or harass you.    I'd be proud of a straight A student!    Good luck.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	If she needs it for school, don't deny it, but once she has finished her project, pack it away and don't let her enjoy it.    In my opinion, there are a few things that you should not mess with when it comes to punishments:    1. Food/Drink      Fair enough take the sweets, but to deny nutrition is wrong. If       the rest of the family is having take away and you decide not      to let the naughty child have any of it, you have to at least       provide something for him/ her to eat.  2. Education      Education and the want to learn is an invaluable asset in your       child's arsenal. It is what gives them their place in society. If       they put forth the effort to learn they will succeed, and punish-      ing bad behavior by limiting the tools for their future success is      not a good thing.  3. Affection        Even though you have scolded the child for the bad behavior,       refusing to acknowledge their presence by giving the silent       treatment or refusing to hug them and tell them even though       you are disappointed in them for their behavior that you still       love them very much is not a good thing, because they can      feel rejected and think that you don't care.    This is my opinion, everyone else is entitled to their own or to share mine if they wish.|`|AA12391059	you definitely should have bought those. it was irresponsible not to give them to her. it was a school project so it wasn't toys or anything. you should NOT feel guilty.even if she misbehaved she still needs to do her schoolwork. that's like not letting her do her homework when she's grounded. the ex was the one with the bad choice. you made a good decision giving them to her, for her and her report card. i hope this helps
yB2cq6NCaa	Ignore them. They're just showing that they're childish and they need to get over themselves. If you do it back, you're just sinking down to their level. Be better than them by not doing it.|`|ZZ1RbxuKaa	to Ignore those stupid peoples  just shrug and move on  or just think about somethings to take revenge on the person  (do not do it in real life though!!!)  or what ever that may be annoying but what evertrust me im there    (this stupid idiot keeps on calling me a devil and a serial killer but that's beside the point!!)     and they'll get bored there just waiting for you to freak out  in some weird way and THEN then they'll have a non stupid reason for talking  behind your back    plus what ever its just a crush you'll move on you got your life ahead of you man!!|`|ca8862a8b9c6038cb99c633d1f1441cdaa	If they keep judging you man, they're not really your friends.

4JJs4pxeaa	get I'm lady girl
f1c9e8a2d8a6b8883ff8ab4239a396e0aa	Put yourself in his shoes.  I hate to tell you this, but it is not all about you.  I am assuming that your dad was with his mom first?  So he is the one that proably feels cheated out of a life.  His parents split.    You made the first move.  Give him a chance to get use to it.  His feelings have little to do with you personally and more to do with his own emotions over what happened to him.    Just wait until he moves.|`|AA12391059	try telling her you realized how much you missed in his life and you feel guilty and would like to try to fix it. she may think bad thoughts and remember to say that you don't mean to be pushy because it may be true that they just aren't interested with you. your half brother may be holding a grudge for you not being there so you could add a sorry or two in there.|`|UyAtzJsFaa	Obviously there is a reason why your parents won't let you contact him. There is a reason why you haven't seen him all these years. When his wife answered the phone you said she seemed shocked, maybe you should figure out why your parents won't let you contact him.   If its nothing then keep calling.|`|79ejyqZtaa	There are 3 ways of approaching this that I can think of.    1. When you call, pose as someone from work, but make sure he is most likely at home at that moment. Tell his wife its urgent and he should come to the phone right now.    2. Find out what his address is and hang around and eventually you'll know what are the times that he comes from work. From then on, try to either make a direct approach, or call him again.    3. Maybe send him a letter (as stated previously by other posters) or find out his phone number. If worst comes to worst, try to reach him via your grandmother.    Good luck,  Sergey|`|PZlEtce4aa	Oh, that is so sad. Your brother might fear of talking to you since its been so long. You should write him a card or something to try to show that you miss him. And it's not that your unwanted, it may be that he's Shy. And don't take this the wrong way, But have you ever considered something might have happened to him? I mean, he might be lost or dead or something. The way his wife reacted on the phone really spoke to me like, "She hasn't heard?" And the way your half brother's mom said, "When he gets home," I don't mean to worry you, but, hey, you never know.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Try not to feel so bad.  I have been through the same thing as you.  My older brother has never returned my phone calls and I was calling him on and off for over 10 years.  It is not you so don't let it make you feel bad.  My brother lives in another state and whenever he comes to my state he always visits my sister but never calls me.  On the few occasions I have seen him he was polite but for whatever reason he never has anything to do with me.  It is painful but you must fill your life with other people and try to forget about him to preserve your own feelings.  Everyone is not going to accept us and unfortunately it is just part of life.  I am sure you must have friends and other family members that care about a great deal.  Try to savor and enjoy those relationshps and forget about small people.|`|ScHW4842aa	I hate to break it to you - but you never made any effort with him - why should he with you?    hahah this makes me laugh. I wouldnt ring you either - youre a nobody to them!|`|r7x5M13Haa	i wont make this long..        CALL AGAIN    otherwise you will always regret it and think-- "well I wonder what would have happened if I had called again..."    make sense?|`|pg5r8kuxaa	this reminds me of what happened to my mum.  her father left when she was young and had recently wanted to get in touch cuz she found out she had broths and sisters. she kept calling and leaving the number and his wife and mother and all kept saying they would give the number and never did.so she called and asked when he would be home and  they told her wrong of course and one day she called and he picked up and they talked and all.  i guess u just have to keep trying hun its not that ur unwanted maybe they r just scared that's what it was with my mum and that part of the family. dont feel unwanted im sure thats not the case.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Some people just aren't phone people and don't know what to say. Keep ringing, eventually you will get him, if they say they will get you to call back ask for an address and send a letter.|`|vvQBkzCtaa	i would try and call again and i would write a letter too . maybe he is not getting the messages.and or he could be nervous about the whole thing does he really know about you did the family tell him . well if those things don't work find out where he lives and go visit.
f1c9e8a2d8a6b8883ff8ab4239a396e0aa	No your mom is not being unfair. Forget your friends advise.  Why would you do something like this that your mom tells you not to do.  I think 15 is too young.    Learn that just because you want something today does not mean you would want it tomorrow.|`|8dZkyiTHaa	i am 13 too and they don't look that great unless ur goin for a "slutty" look|`|r7x5M13Haa	ok that makes sense now lol        and NO    seriously-- you wont like this answer but when your 13 you wanna try new things and "defeat" your parents in some way..its just that age     i think when your 15 you won't even want a belly button piercing-- because you will think its a bad idea..and yes you CAN just take it out when you get over it but there is no hiding it from your mom.. trust me--experience-- trust me    illegally -------   stupid idea  SERIOUSLY|`|xPR7g0wFaa	I wouldnt let my 13 year old daughter get hers done. You cant get it done without your parents consent,sorry.|`|V4BSfZzWaa	Really they are trashy and it hurts like hell.      BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT!|`|UyAtzJsFaa	Well I personally don't think that is being unfair at all. You are thirteen, that's too young. Your mom said you could get it at fifteen which is fair. She didn't say you could never get it, at least she said you can have it.     Btw: That is a really stupid decision to get it done illegally. ILLEGAL: NOT LEGAL. Why would you get it don't illegally if you can get it done LEGALLY when your mom allows you too?!|`|AA12391059	your mom is not being unfair. your only thirteen! you couild regret it later because your young and trying to grow up too fast. when you slow down you will always have that hole in your stomach. getting it done illegally?! most definitly not!. you can get so many life threatning diseases.i know this isn't the answer you wanted to hear but its a bad decision.if you die from it you won't be able to have your ring. think of why you want the ring? if you think it will look cool it won't they are disgusting! also try asking your mom what her point of veiw is. it may be that she has reasons you just don't see. this also may help convince her. persuade her because you'll just get grounded for the illegal way. plus by persuasion you may see wether you really want it or not.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Piercings need a lot of care especially those that involve a hole that is that big. You may even need antibiotics to heal it up, it may push itself out of the skin otherwise, and if you are trying to hide it, your mom won't be able to get you to the doctor to get the medication you need incase your skin rejects it. Getting this sorta thing done illegally could lead to problems because some people who aren't qualified or allowed to do these sort of things often disregard certain regulations such as cleaning/ disinfecting their equipment which can lead to other problems such as HIV and other not so nice germs that can be passed from one person to another. I think 15 years old is a reasonable age to be allowed to do such a thing, at 13 you are still irrational and do not even know who you are yet, sorry but its true. My son is 13 and he is still quite confused.  Wait til you are 15, at least then you might actually get the proper jewelry that will not infect you and be able to be taken to the doctor by your mom so that you don't end up with a nasty yucky scar on your belly button and never be able to wear a bikini again because lack of self confidence with the big pink pus filled scars.

sr7jX2wYaa	Maybe you need to start acting aloof, & that  might   get his  attention, just  like his actions  have gotten yours. I don't know what the fight  was over, but that would be where  you need to start evaluating  what might  be going on.  Really don't act like it  bothers you so much , guys  can't  stand  it when a girl  they KNOW they have  suddenly acts as if all will be okay with or without them. & want that devotion back, unless they have the attention of someone else, & are looking  for excuses to end it*|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Well, I don't think that you are being up front here. He didn't just end it because of a fight. It was probably something you said/did or something he realized about himself or you. What did he say he needed, did he say he needs time? Days, weeks, months? Im sure he told you why he is doing what he is doing (they usually do) but you just didn't listen to him. Either he is hot and cold and always has been this way, or something happened that changed his mind. Whether its temporary or not, I wouldn't know. Things that happen in relationships are complicated, so he cant just end it. Maybe he really does need time to think. So do you. If I had more information about what happened in the fight it would be easier understand and give you better advice. All I can say is ask him why he needs time, if its legitimate then give him some space. Sometimes people just want to know if you will respect their space and they will turn around sooner than you think. Whatever it is good luck.|`|QHJoFyfUaa	Maybe you should talk to him. Your relationship was so perfect. It can't just end after one fight like that. Maybe he's going through something else, or he might just randomly feel stressed. Sometimes guys are hard to explain. Definitely give him time. If he doesn't want to talk yet, he'll talk when he's ready. Good luck! :)
aDL7xmt6aa	How fun is that??|`|i2V17yi4aa	rub it in the carma is a bi*ch!  he will think and think about it and finally he will get it!|`|0Id85yiYaa	no, you're not wrong for telling him this. it's the truth.|`|bO2rzfISaa	If he's rejecting the idea that she's cheating (and you say he is) then you need to leave it alone. It's his choice.|`|fQYU96euaa	well you claim to be "good friends" so it would be wrong of you not to share your honest ...and professional opinions with him.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	karma will get you every time|`|DenLZAL1aa	He cheated on you too. He got what he deserves, dump this clown or you will be taking pills.|`|DdSnno9daa	wow|`|lyhnHhuWaa	There's no way to know.  Trich is so common that there's no telling where, or when, she acquired it.  I'm not defending her or anything but I also don't think it's fair to assume that she cheated on him.  Since men usually don't show symptoms she could have actually gotten it from him.  You don't know who he screwed before he hooked up with her.  It is possible for a woman to not have symptoms.  I'm sure that, as a nurse, you're aware that some women never know they have it until it's identified in an exam.  She could have had it before she met him.  Whether she's cheating or not is debatable and can't be proven based on the fact that she has trich alone.  That's like saying that your partner is cheating if HPV shows up in an exam.  It's just too common an infection at 3 million cases a year to assume that it wasn't pre-existing.|`|PNPVkbptaa	No girl that is wonderful that that is happening to him hahahahahah serves him right. I'm saying this because my husband almost left me for someone else so I know how you feel and I'm glad to see that these dirty whores and are getting what they deserve.
Whd6tqLzaa	I feel bad for you. I had the same situation with my father. He was very unpredictable, got mad for for tiniest things, broke furniture, China and beat my mom. She dealt with him but I know she must have felt worse during those days. We didn't know what was the cause and he never got treated for any problem. But surely he had an abusive relationship with my mom and needed treatment for it.    I suggest that you talk to somebody, a physician or a close relative. Get him treated for his anger, there are anger management courses. He should learn how to deal with his anger. Hopefully that will help you save your marriage. On the other hand, you shouldn't feel like a rabbit in a marriage and he can't treat you like a little girl and burst into anger for slightest things.|`|kbz5S3waaa	My husband used to be like that, but then we went to 'anger management' - therapy and it really did help. He's a lot better and easier to be around now.|`|i2V17yi4aa	on one of his good days take him to mental health!|`|bO2rzfISaa	This is highly abusive. You should leave, but be careful when you do.

You can't. You've got an out of control dangerous man on your hands.  Why don't you ask what is wrong with you that you stay with someone like this?  Do you like being terrorized and afraid? Is your love for him so strong that there's no room for you to love yourself?  You can't change him. But you can change yourself from a passive self sacrificing victim into a real woman.|`|hs793CCxaa	I believe you do everything you can to keep your marriage together.

Leave him, or insist on anger management classes.|`|0CJahWImaa	If you begin to soothe him, it begins a typical abusive relationship.  You trying to change or tiptoe around his behavior? Absolutely NOT!   He can either get control of his behavior (therapy) or you need to leave.  I know you love him, you wouldn't be with him if you didn't.  Imagine this:  Forty or so years from now, maybe you have children, maybe even grandchildren....will you really be happy with having lived like this and potentially worse behavior?   Didn't you have dreams at one point? How are those coming along in this environment?|`|5v7iDvoCaa	he needs to seek counceling find out why hes angry.  most of the time it has to do with an emotionally abusive childhood.|`|XmudUg2aaa	There is no magic cure.    When he is ready to get help, he will do what he needs to do to change. i.e., attending anger management classes.    It is very admirable that you are trying to save this marriage.     But your children come first. God has given them to you to protect. So use your head and protect them if he isn't going to use his.    Are you prepared to take your husband out (take his life)? Because if he comes after one of the kids one day you may have to.     And how will you feel if he seriously hurts one of your kids?    Do you have sons? What is he teaching your sons? That it is okay to terrorize your family by acting like a over-sized toddler at any moment?    I know you are hungry for him to change. YOU CAN NOT CHANGE HIM. Period. If there was something you could do....he would be changed by your sheer will alone by now.    What are you waiting for?     His death or yours?    Or one of your kids?

Then find ribbon and other decorations in the green shades that you like for your centerpieces, chair bows etc.  If you like pink, why not a pale pink for the table cloths.  Pale pink and white flowers tied with teal and light green ribbon would be beautiful for the bouquets.  You could also have your flower girl in pale pink.      Too much of any one color, even in different shades can be over kill!    Good luck!
JxUFDutxaa	Absolutely..they tend to get less aggravatiing as you enter your twenties..and they become quite full of wisdom from age 30 on..|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Absolutely! I don't know anyone whose folks didn't aggravate them starting with the teenage years. It'll even out in time.|`|w7j8Qne6aa	YES! I'm 16 and my parents annoy me all the time. It has come to points in the past where I have lived at friends houses because I just can't stand my parents any more. Hopefully I can move out once I go to Uni, but if not then I will find a scabby little bedsit and live there. I am moving out ASAP!!   Just think though- it's only a few years until you can move out, and if you can tolerate them until then it will be ok. Best thing to do is try to reason with them, because then they think you are more mature and will let you out more and ask less questions. If you argue they just get suspicious.|`|Lz8ef3Okaa	dude I so have the same problem with them especially my dad!!! Sometimes I think its because us teens are so rebellious but I think by the time teens move out we'll so understand.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Of course it is. If you were never aggravated by your parents you would live with them for ever.|`|OCfr6A8Naa	omg yes im 16 and am just so annoyed by them and the way they see things and the way they do things   grrrrrr lol|`|YfIQ02Oeaa	From the ages of 13 until you move out of your parents home, it is normal for you to be aggravated by them.|`|3uF9lZIyaa	yes, especially when I'm being abused and treated like crap|`|M5oMYc9Laa	It is completely normal and part of growing up.
RWpSVJtlaa	Never!  Jesus, if your fiancee has done this then you really need to re-think the relationship!|`|BNqbOfBsaa	lol! are you serious?? So whats going to happen when you 2 are together? Your going to get a "time out" to "bang" away the stress? Arguments are a part of any relationship and if your not grown up enough to handle them then your probably better off calling the whole thing off because it seems like someone is not mature enough.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	No    *holds head in hands and sighs at amount of stupidity in the world*|`|CSWHwlzvaa	Uh NO!|`|1KaHJD8Laa	Sure if you are a bit slutty and don't really care about the serious relationship that you are supposed to have.    Everyone argues at times in their relationships, if you are serious enough to get engaged but are prepared to sleep with other people after an argument I would suggest it's time to finish the relationship.
K6JSNQJQaa	Well....sounds like you do have a nice ***!  Squats do wonders for your legs and ***...believe me it's not a bad thing for a woman to say that to you.  It's a compliment!!  Keep up the good work! :-)|`|MBqoeaEJaa	IT MEAN YOU A NICE SET OF BUNS.......YUM!|`|IV5NvStYaa	usually when a girl says a guy has a nice ***,  they mean its nice and toned . not all like floppy aha.. ew . if your muscular then im sure you have a toned butt, squats affect both your legs and butt so it could also mean you have an athletics butt, which isnt bad at all either.. just not a fat *** .. aha   (:|`|dBDxfrLFaa	idk.. i have never though of that... lolz    but i have had boys telling me i have a big one too... but they say it in a good way... got off topic srry!!! lolz|`|ZfqKbAB8aa	It just means that whoever told you that you had a nice butt pays attention to your body.|`|e9bd9999335469f7464951316ef42637aa	i like an athletic round butt on a guy. you probably do have a nice butt. pics please. :P jk.|`|GOYPKp3Baa	It means their butt is nicely shaped ;) In other words, sexy to a womans eyes.

I hope you get the bites you're looking for.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	You are very lucky your wife is lazy. If she had any energy she would get up and leave you.|`|91W8HrJiaa	You are nothing but a self-absorbed, lazy, pathetic a$$hole who probably needs his mother there to wipe his stinking *** too!  Cockroaches deserve more respect than a piece of $hit like you.  Your wife should put you over her knee and spank the $hit out of you, and then shove the remote she's been HIDING from you up that sorry rectum of yours.  Scumbag.|`|ScHW4842aa	you should not attempt to hold back farts as they wish to exit the anus. its not good.     = today's friendly relationship advice|`|4A8lGwYJaa	this has to be a joke....   >:-(    who would want to be with you...|`|Y9HWim3Baa	I don't believe your story.|`|br0BbJfcaa	this is a joke post right?  you're an unemployed dude that can't find the remote and your mom is making you lunch and rearranging the house - you're lucky your wife doesn't just get up and leave, poor lady!

Your mom came over to fix you lunch LOL...how old did you say you were?|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U obviously have more time on your hands than the rest of us do. Maybe U need to join the Peace Corp or something? I'm sure somebody in your household needs a break from you.
nqINitkmaa	Wine of the month club. I got it for my parents for christmas, its a fabulous gift. It can range anywhere from $170 to $500+ depending on how long you get the membership for and what kind of wine you choose.     The couple will get a bottle of wine every month, with information on the wine and a recipe to cook that will pair with the wine. Its a really fun unique gift, and it lasts for months!|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	When I attended a Bavarian wedding in germany ten years ago, they had amazingly fun gifts!  Everyone tried to out do each other.  As cash is traditional they do fun things with it, lots of origami and stuff but the most entertaining threengs were:  -huge bag full of sawdust and quarters.  Imagine $500 in quarters and dollar coins in a large gold bag  filled with sawdust.  the couple ended up dumping it out outside and using a leaf blower (the gifts were opened with family the day )  -a concrete block that had been poured with plastic eggs inside.  Inside the eggs were bills in different dnominations  -many people did a variation of small wooden doll sized furniture with money inside folded like clothing.  There was an armoire with shirts hanging inside- the shirts were 20 mark bills, there was a doll dresser with bills folded like shirts and pants.      My old standby is money in whatever currency they need for their honeymoon or something from theor registry that I can imagine them using every day:)|`|7JFUiBoKaa	Get them a wicker picnis basket with all the accessories. My niece got one several years ago and always uses it.|`|AA12245847	If you want to wait and send them something at the hotel, get a family member or two to go in on a couples spa package for them.  I would have loved that for my honeymoon!!!
t3YT79WHaa	Myspace   Facebook  Say you accidentally called  text em  email em  forward em  just say hi and be like omg its been forever since ive talked to you    you asked a pretty stupid question though lol  just talk to them they arent gonna like talk back and b like i hate you haha|`|zjfCnk5xaa	myspace.com|`|RzhKIOHZaa	A surprise phone call.    "Guess who?!"|`|eAznKEEkaa	myspace always works.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	Classmates.com, I reconnected with childhood 5 friends I had not seen in 30 years, and see many of my old school friends when I go to visit my elderly mother in the town I was born and raised in.
FiCl71flaa	It is truly  interesting that you are asking that question. You have analyzed your problem so well and so accurately and that is half of the solution.  The other half of the solution is the why and the what. The why part is hard to say based on the information that you have given which is incomplete and insufficient.I could speculate that it might have its origin in your family dynamics; a situation that may be making you insecure, not sure of people who say they love you and won't leave you, or people who claimed they loved you and won't leave you have done just that, or you like the chase, that is proving that guys like you( or you can get them to like you) rather than wanting the relationship, for your pride or ego needs and so on. The what is what do you do now. I will suggest that you :1) decide if you really want a romantic relationship or not. Some people do not and maybe you are one such person. 2) If you do want a relationship, figure out the qualities you want in the guy you want to share your life with. Also what you are going to offer him in return . You have to meet his needs just as you want him to meet yours. 3) After you know the answer to 2 above, then see which  guy- 1 or 2 has them; pick that guy or you might have to select a different person altogether.  4) If you still do not know then maybe you need some help from a mental health professional  to help shed some light on the issue and propose a treatment protocol for you. I suspect that after trying all or some of the ideas above, you will come to not only understand yourself better but also how to resolve the issues that may surface. I wish you all the best and a positive outcome.|`|DdSnno9daa	join the club|`|YNPnAwFNaa	That means that neither guy one or guy two are the one for you.    the grass is always greener on the other side...|`|vccgSRAsaa	WHILE your dating Guy 1 Guy 2 might look really exciting. because it seems greener on the other side of the fence if you know what i mean.|`|tujPUS59aa	Well I think you just like change a lot. I think you should decide who you like more, guy 1 or guy 2. And if it doesn't work out with one of them, there is always the other one.|`|9mVaohOraa	let him smell your feet after work|`|ZSDEFSRBaa	you probuly want  1 because you know you cant have him back|`|RDxwA15kaa	Stay with guy number 2. Dont go damaging everyones feelings because you cant decide who you want.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	You should make up your mind and quit going backwards and forwards before you are left with no one.|`|X1YVUA5oaa	You need to grow up.|`|N0rI6N9baa	just shut up. it was your choice to break up with guy 1. now you want him back. you screwed up. deal with it. your decision. think before you act. jerk.|`|0e999f5ffc3b68a26b333974da10ffbdaa	lol, i have to agree, join the club. i was dating this guy, but i broke up with him for the girl of my dreams (im bi). now HES dating her and i want him sooooo bad... so i know the feeling. dont worry abotu it though. if things are meant to work out, they will. all in due time. be patient, some things takea logn time. i waited 3 years for a guy that i only knew for a week. but i trust he's comign back, cause i knw if im meant to be with him he will come.... so just wiat it out, you'll be happy in the end, even if its not for the reasons you hope for now. :)
8ygky5g4aa	I actually did.  I wore my grandmothers dress, it was a circa 1942 dress with a Chantilly lace bodice, long sleeves and silk faille skirt with a 5' train.      If you do decide to wear either of yours, make sure you find a seamstress that specializes in restoring or altering vintage dresses.  The woman I found was able to let my grandmothers dress out and tailor it to fit me perfectly.  She also tea stained my mothers veil to match the candle light color of the dress.    Good luck!    PS here is a pic of my dress.  Unfortunately it was stolen in a break in.    http://www.flickr.com/photos/9958541@N08...|`|HiSVA9p8aa	In a heartbeat, I would wear one of the dresses.  Or both, one to the ceremony and one for the reception.|`|aLJdfbd3aa	Absolutely!    You're lucky to have the chance. If you like either of the dresses (or could like it with some alterations) and it could fit, I would definitely wear it. I'm looking for a vintage wedding dress right now, hoping somebody's granddaughter decided to get rid of the gown that is perfect for me.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	No, absolutely not.  I believe every bride deserves her own dress for her wedding day.|`|nqINitkmaa	No I wouldn't, I want to wear a dress that is in style now, and that fits me well. It would not have any special meaning to me either, its just their dress.|`|n53HeORBaa	well yeah, that would be the best way to be close to my family during the most special and memorable day of my life and it would be vintage and very unique, no other bride would have the same type of dress that i would have|`|AA10975867	Well, first, it would have to fit. If not, it would have to be altered and a dressmaker may not be able to match color of threads, etc.. Second. It would have to be wearable. My mother was married in 1945 and her wedding gown is disintegrating in spots. Hold the older one up to the light and you may be surprised to see how weak it is. Third. It would be yellowed somewhat so it would have to look good. If you pass all 3 of those things, and are a sentimental type, go for it.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No for several reasons. 2 of the 3 are deceased and none of them kept their dresses, nor were they passed on to anyone. I don't fit in their clothes anyway even if I did like the styles they wore.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I'm about 8 inches taller than both of my grandmothers (they are tiny!), so it would never work.    But I would wear my mother's dress. It's a really simple ivory column dress with lace sleeves. It's classic and beautiful, but it would need alterations to fit me and it would need a really good cleaning|`|1wPnh9Ltaa	It's an honor to wear such a sentimental piece, but if you, personally, do not like the look of the dress, then don't wear it. I am sure your family will understand because it's your big day, and it's your decision.|`|ADP9swbMaa	That depends on what the dress looks like. Do you like the style of it? (Personally, I like old-fashioned things. What eras are they from?) Are they in good condition? How much seamstress work would they need, and can they handle it?  If they were in good condition and I liked the style of them, sure I would wear one of them.   Do you happen to have pictures?|`|Rii7lfFUaa	Nope|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I wish I could have, but I am very tall and both grandmothers are extremely petite.  I really love vintage fashions.
NSa3RIQCaa	That is a hard question. My opinion is it completely depends on the reason for telling the lie. If you are telling it to get out of trouble or for personal gain of any sort than absolutely not. However, if you are truly just trying to make that person happy then I think it would be ok. Again, this is just my opinion and just a theory. If I were you I would read the true story of Corrie Ten Boom or look her up online or something.|`|shvhgzXeaa	Yeah especially when there dying. Lies are also good when you have a surprise party for someone stuff like that.|`|RbSs7ll1aa	Well I believe that there is some moments where it is okay to   just not say anything. It is not completely lying.     For example, if a guy and a girl are in love and she ends up dying and she told someone that she was going to leave him. I don't think that person should tell her boyfriend that she was going to leave him.     Hope I was helpful!  Good Luck!|`|0sw9nrcpaa	if u didnt tell lies in some situations then people might be hurt etc. i dont usually lie but i might if it would hurt someone if i told them the real answer|`|dduWesM5aa	only if it saves someones life.|`|cEHhv7Emaa	yeah, in their last moments it would be nice to make them feel good|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	This just in from every husband that ever existed: When wife asks you, "Do these jeans make my butt look big?"
yLNsOJiQaa	It really depends on the area that you live in and the sport or activity that they are wanting to do.  For example, we live in the DFW area in Texas and for my youngest to play football this past season I believe we spent a total between $300.00 - $400.00.  This was for uniform, activities, admission into games, and other things.  My oldest is playing baseball this spring and I am looking at putting out probably about $200.00 for his stuff.      All four of us did karate with ATA, which is EXPENSIVE, and it was like almost $350.00 a month for us.  I believe that it is like $100.00 a month or so for one.  This did not include the equipment.  It was about $900.00 for all of our equipment.  You have a to sign a contract with ATA so you are looking at about $1000 - $1,200 for a year in fees and a couple hundred for equipment.  This was with ATA, I am not sure about other karate places.    As for voice, piano, and instrument lessons you usually pay by the hour  per lesson and if they come to you or you go to them.  So, you would really need to do research to see what they are charging in your area.  Usually, it is like $20 - $30 per lesson.    I hope that this gives you a general idea.
cSOpcKOWaa	I would find out who lives the closest and see if you could go halves in the gas money for going to choir. Then I would ask dear old daddy for the gas money, and not worry about asking anyone else in your family for a ride to choir again. When you become a famous singer then they can pay you to come watch you.|`|pg5r8kuxaa	i don't think that would be rude if you asked people in your choir to drive you find out who could or lives near and ask. its not rude it just shows that u r dedicated to the choir and that  you really wanna be there|`|1MkcGgKjaa	do you have their phone numbers from the choir? just say "im sorry but would you mind giving me a ride to choir, as i have no other way of going and i love the choir so much" or something along those lines.    itll be fine, try to choose one of the people who live nearer you. its not rude at all, itll be fine :)    good luck!|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Your family does not understand your discomfort at asking for a ride from someone in the choir, so they think you're just being difficult.    You should ask around for a ride. The way you ask is to ask the group in general if anyone goes your way and could they give you a ride. For instance, when three or four people or standing together, say excuse me, but could anyone give me a ride? I live on __ Street and my mom is ill.    Look at it this way - you are helping conserve fuel by asking for a ride for someone going your way.    If you are not willing to step out of yourself enough to ask for a ride, you may have to give up choir. That would be a shame.    Good luck. And remember that no one is going to mind that you asked for a ride. Be brave.    Good luck.
60zSf7Yzaa	1) I got my hair done around 2 or 3 i think so...about 4 hours before.  Then I would go home and do my makeup and nails.    2) We would just get a bunch of people together and go for dinner.  My senior year we rented a limo.  If you split the price between a bunch of people it's really not that expensive.     3) If you're worried about getting something on your dress at dinner, make sure you order something that isn't too messy and wouldn't leave much of a mark if you did...like definitely no spaghetti or ribs!  Just be extra careful..it usually doesn't happen though.  Keep a Tide stain stick or something like that with you just in case.    Have fun and don't do anything stupid!  If your school is putting on an afterglow afterwords, ours were always really fun.  Kids get caught so often for stupid stuff on prom night- that would just ruin everything!  Good luck! :)|`|1k7pcUHkaa	half of the people in my year hated our school because they were really mean. so half of us never turned up for our prom and we all went to the cinema instead.  whatta **** prom that turned out to be!|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Well, for one I got mine done at least between 1 hour to 2 hours before. I had some taken with my date, my friends and myself. The make-up/hair/nails took about 2 hours to get done (I spent a lot of time on it).    2. I don't know exactly what you mean. I did what I said above and that's it.     3. Well, for 3;  - Make sure to NEVER trip  - Look your best  -Don't spill anything|`|dL4x119gaa	i went to a private school that believed dancing was a sin that leads to sex, so we didn't have a prom, we had "banquet".  my senior class rented a local restaurant and we all had dinner together.    since dancing is against the school's belief, the parents threw us a dance afterwards at the boys n girls club...    my date was the cousin of the bball team's point guard, a dude i never got along with, so we went to the dance, smoked a bunch of pot in the car, chugged a few beers and went and danced.      then we went to the afterparty at my date's cousin's (the PG) house, where i f*cked my date on her cousin's bed.|`|ixHwF4apaa	i do not know much about proms but give some hints about it preparation, nails to be  done a day before prom. trim  your hair or straight it, it could take a while getting your hair done, prepare yourself around noon are night any time. afterward your  dress on and have pictures. have some lunch or dinner lightly. then concentrate on your make-up self or by a makeup man. then it has  to go. good luck!!!!!!! have a nice time. tell us your experience or share us after you finishes. ok good luck|`|J3lUKBKPaa	my prom was really kinda different then most people but i will tell you see the guy that was taking me to prom was my best friend i was totally in love with him but he was older then me by 7 years so he felt real uncomfortable about going so i told him well lets just go out somewhere or whatever so he came and picked me up and took me over to the water that was across from were my prom was so i could actually see the prom as it was happening so we sat and talked for a while and he said here take this quarter throw it in the water fall and make a wish so i did now keep in mind that i had been in love with him for about 7 yrs by that time just waiting for him to love me back so anyways he said so what did you wish for i laughed and said i cant tell you that it wont come true well of coarse my wish was that i could spend the rest of my life with him and that he would love me as much as i loved him but i didnt tell him that so he hands me another quarter and tells me to stand up this time and face the water fall so i could give it a harder throw and make my wish again i kinda felt silly but hey whatever ya no so after i threw it i turned around and there he was down on one knee with a big diamond ring and said so i dont really no what your wish was but i hope it was a wish that will make you say yes and then took my hand and said will you marry me.......we have been married for 9 years now and he is still my best friend and the love of my life.|`|uwtuavULaa	I had my nails done a day before prom. depending on your hairstyle, it could take a while getting your hair done, I started at around noon. afterward I put my dress on and took pictures. We grabbed a pizza. then I did my make-up. by then it was time to go.  good luck!!!!!!!|`|MBqoeaEJaa	STRIP POKER...|`|5ljmL3hsaa	OH YOU ARE SO LUCKY.  I live in Scotland, and we don't get proms. We don't get anything.American people have high school and proms and cheer leading, like all the stuff you see in films. So lucky.  Have fun at your prom:D  xox|`|x9cM3hJiaa	girl prom is SO fun, you will have a blast, i cant wait till prom this year!    1) it doesnt matter about nails, they will last even if you get them the day before. get your hair done, and then makeup. you dont want to get your makeup done and then your hairdresser messing with your hair and probably messing up your makeup. your hair will stay. just make sure to tell whoevers doing it that you need it to last and to load it up with hairspray! for the pictures i did them with my whole group right before prom, we all met at a friends house and took pictures then went to dinner then went to the dance from there.    2) you DEFINATELY have to go to dinner with your date before. and if youre worried about spilling, just order something non messy :)    3) maybe find an after party to go to, or have everyone back to your house to hangout after, its definately a fun way to end the night!|`|MEXaeimoaa	This year..    I got my nails done two days before, so that if I didn't like the way they turned out I could get them re-done without hassle.  They turned out bad the year before and it really upset me.    And I did my hair myself.  (If you do that, make sure you have what you're doing down.)  But I've had it done for a prom before.  And I got it done three hours before I left.  So go in about four and a half hours before.    I did my makeup an hour before I left.  (You really need to practice how you're going to wear it beforehand.)    Then put on my jewelry and dress.    Don't worry too much about spilling something, and if you are, use a napkin, put it in your lap or where ever.    (: have fun!|`|DnrBx8PLaa	Well,lets see. The first time that I went to the prom was in June 6,1990 with my girlfriend Valerie Suzanne Curtis and we danced for a while then we sat and talked and my girl friend Valerie Curtis wanted a foot massage so I gave her a foot massage and told her not to put her feet in my face. However,I also told her to save it for Halloween. I hope you have fun at the prom with you partner. Don't do anything that I won't do.
FAeCVkExaa	well since u say shes not a talk-it-out person i would say try 2 expand ur social circle and try 2 make new best friends, i understand they might not be the same as ur friend Layne here but i bet they could be more respectful to you and make u feel alittle jelous of another person. dont take this kind of b.s. from a person, ik i did and i regret it but try 2 start getting alittle distant wit her (alittle bit at a time) when u have found sum1 tht u think and will be a better best friend than the last, im not saying anything 2 hurt u but try tht and see how it works =)  i hope this helps   -Roxas|`|5Hmyjr7Eaa	well she is probably nice but it sounds to me like shes using you   try to make some better choices on who you pick as a friend   trust me i just got through a big friend fight|`|C4N3TM3maa	Well i really don't think that she deserves to be your bff. she reminds me of one of my "friends" who basically did the same thing. i just am nice to my supposed "friend" obviously you shouldn't try to be friends with her she will probably be a fake.  good luck|`|8RM9MDqEaa	if she's a person like you say, and if it bothers you, she's not fit to be your best friend. depends on what your definition of a best friend is. if a best friend is someone you can talk to whenever about your problems or whatever, then she's obviously not covered to be your best friend.
7JFUiBoKaa	You Can Let Go Now Daddy by Crystal Shawanda. This is an aweome song.|`|nqINitkmaa	I loved her first- Heartland its a very very sweet song. Check it out!    Look at the two of you dancing that way  Lost in the moment and each others face  So much in love your alone in this place  Like there's nobody else in the world  I was enough for her not long ago  I was her number one  She told me so  And she still means the world to me  Just so you know  So be careful when you hold my girl  Time changes everything  Life must go on  And I'm not gonna stand in your way    But I loved her first and I held her first  And a place in my heart will always be hers  From the first breath she breathed  When she first smiled at me  I knew the love of a father runs deep  And I prayed that she'd find you someday  But it still hard to give her away  I loved her first    How could that beautiful women with you  Be the same freckle face kid that I knew  The one that I read all those fairy tales to  And tucked into bed all those nights  And I knew the first time I saw you with her  It was only a matter of time    But I loved her first and I held her first  And a place in my heart will always be hers  From the first breath she breathed  When she first smiled at me  I knew the love of a father runs deep  And I prayed that she'd find you someday  But its still hard to give her away  I loved her first    From the first breath she breathed  When she first smiled at me  I knew the love of a father runs deep  Someday you might know what I'm going through  When a miracle smiles up at you  I loved her first|`|n53HeORBaa	butterfly kisses would be nice, this is a song about a father's love for his daughter with the memories and up to the point of the daughters wedding day..i don't know who sang it but it is one of those old songs, i am sure that you can research the music through the net|`|xPR7g0wFaa	This is kinda long, sorry    BUTTERFLY KISSES:    There's two things I know for sure:  She was sent here from heaven and she's  daddy's little girl.  As I drop to my knees by her bed at night  She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes and  I thank god for all the joy in my life  Oh, but most of all  For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer;  sticking little white flowers all up in her  hair; "Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride."  "I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried."  In all that I've done wrong I know I must  have done something right to deserve a hug  every morning and butterfly kisses at night.    Sweet 16 today  She's looking like her mama a little more everyday  One part woman, the other part girl.  To perfume and make-up from ribbons and curls  Trying her wings out in a great big world.    But I remember  Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer; sticking  little white flowers all up in her hair.  "You know how much I love you, Daddy, But if you  don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time."  With all that I've done wrong I must have done  something right to deserve her love every morning  and butterfly kisses at night.    All the precious time  Like the wind, the years go by.  Precious butterfly.  Spread your wings and fly.    She'll change her name today.  She'll make a promise and I'll give her away.  Standing in the bride-room just staring at her.  She asked me what I'm thinking and I said "I'm not  sure-I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl."  She leaned over...gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there,  Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair  "Walk my down the aisle, Daddy-it's just about time."  "Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy? Daddy, don't cry!"    Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have  done something right.  To deserve your love every morning and butterfly  kisses-I couldn't ask God for more, man this is what love is.    I know I gotta let her go, but I'll always remember  every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses.      UPDATE: I have to agree with the answers below....I loved her first is another good one.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	No worries man, there is nothing wrong with you. Your a man and she's a woman, its natural in my opinion. Just be cautious about making a move on her.|`|66tpufsgaa	nothings wrong.   i think my cousins are pretty hot. haha|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	its cool maybe your just curious! as long as  you dont do anything weird with her|`|0QEeXzOEaa	I personally think its kinda weird. My cousin and I have gotten changed in the same room, but we don't really look at each other. I don't think you have a problem. You are family and its not exactly unusual... it would be weird to...you know with her|`|AA12135516	You are human! Just because she's your cousin doesn't mean you can't look but just leave it at that & don't touch ok?
f1eMHsoLaa	photoshop and good camwhoring skills|`|eAznKEEkaa	ook wat????!!!!!!
wpi36XBAaa	One of the responsibilities of Power Of Attorney is that you always act in the person's best interest, and I don't think getting an annulment without his knowledge or consent would qualify as that. Do you?|`|DenLZAL1aa	Why would you want too. Annul the marriage, and let him know. He has the right to revoke the power of attorney.|`|br0BbJfcaa	ask an attorney|`|D27rM7auaa	No you would need his signature|`|WknwC3yzaa	chk with your state. Your state might have no fault law divorce. You can have your cake and eat it too. Just without that person!|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Why wouldn't you want your spouse to know about the annulment? You don't have to exercise the power of attorney and can have it rescinded on the basis that you cannot carry out the functions in a manner that best respresents the best interests of the spouse (soon to be ex).
w7j8Qne6aa	Do something with him. Go out and have fun. If you're anything like me, I mostly let my brother (he's 12) get on with whatever he's doing, but he loves a bit of rough and tumble. Whe I want to get him out, we just go to the park, or in the garden and have a game of 'rugby' which constists of getting a mini rugby ball to our scoring areas by any means possibe. It makes for very interesting game play and is really fun!! Sometimes we set rules, like no throwing leaves in faces... or no take downs on the patio, but most of the time it's ok.  If he doesn't like games, maybe taking him out for a walk? Just do something with him- he will appreciate the effort you make to have fun with him.
upJjIljOaa	Well, he might like you because of how in to you he is. But i have the same problem at school whos sending the same signals but I know he doesn't like me because we are just friends. If someone likes you then he should tell you. Also, if you REALLY want to know what he thinks then ask him. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Just ask, What do you think of me? And he should tell you if he likes you or not. That's what I did. I hope it helps you too!|`|4L1c8kF8aa	MAYBE HE DOES LIKE YOU.......... GOOD LUCK.....................|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	Yeah sounds like it :) tell him you like him, he's probably wondering too!|`|e7I0PXBNaa	I think there is potential there, you guys seem cute together. but before you do anything make sure you have a pretty good understaning of how you feel about him. Maybe ask him out and see how he responds. He probably doesn't think you like him like he likes you, so make sure he is aware of it.|`|8b223213bf4fad7bd69b5aba849b7174aa	It seems you are right as you said you guys are sharing "personal secrets" . Good Luck:)|`|YNPnAwFNaa	The same thing happened to me, almost exactly.[;  And guess what he told me the other week?  he likes me too!    Therefore, if our guys are anything alike, then yeah. he likes you[;|`|nEg8crOGaa	yes he does my current boyfriend did that to me before we were dating my solution is if u like him try and be brave and asks if he likes you
c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Craigslist and the internet chat rooms are a pedophiles dream. Any parent that leaves their child with a stranger is courting a nightmare that their child may have to relive for the rest of their lives.    Just because you've had a child does not make you a wise parent.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	This is a very irresponsible parent, however, there is not much than can be done because they are not breaking the law.  This is the earmark of a parent that is selfish putting their own entertainment ahead of the safety and well-being of their children.  Unfortunately, the world is full of such irresponsible people who should not even be pet owners --let alone parents.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	She should have reworded the ad to say:    Calling all child molesters! My child will be yours from 9-2 while I get drunk. $25 bonus for keeping her quiet.    Stupid people shouldn't have children!|`|8dZkyiTHaa	thats a bad parent|`|REfdT8JFaa	In my opinion I feel like maybe she was trying to find a local teenager to baby-sit. I dont think she really took into consideration that there are freaky people out there who read that stuff. I for one would not have done that I would have asked around with friends for a good sitter.|`|01q3aJpgaa	there are parents out there that just dont care sometimes you just need to egnor it or fill out a complaint form to the police you could posibly save a life   i mean what if the person he or she fineds is a perv   but if you are this conncerned you should take the job   you sound legit and you could help a child.
zWqKuIQuaa	So hes gone through the both of you hey.    Does this loser realise that you were both in class and maybe you were supposed to be concentrating on the teacher.  Does he sit there in class every day staring at you.  What a creep.|`|ixHwF4apaa	let it be, you just ignore once again. past is past forget the past|`|lGdzb8aqaa	do you guys work on the show the bold and beautiful.|`|yaCCJNKEaa	He is your ex for a reason and needs to stop trying to interfere in your life.  Continue to ignore him and move on.|`|S852p6SXaa	im surprised is girlfriend (your friend) didnt get pissed about this cause to me it seems like he still has feelings for you deep down inside somewhere.|`|cl6r8cGBaa	wha??|`|sm8sWirVaa	sounds lik he eliked u bt ur jusa total *****|`|VHD1azeUaa	why would he tell his gf that?....      what a loser.|`|ZSDEFSRBaa	your question is not clear|`|Br38OspXaa	well i think there's a whole bunch of issues there, one being why is your ex dating your best friend and two why does your ex still stare at you? i think that maybe you should talk to your ex and figure out what's going on|`|iXbRVkPAaa	lmao ok|`|0e999f5ffc3b68a26b333974da10ffbdaa	wow, haha, my ex (who is dating my best friend) would NEVEr admit to starign at me..... i tihnk he still has feelings for you and only started dating her to try and get back at you. but its not workign so he is mad that you dont still ahve feelings for him.|`|LNEWbymsaa	Well... you should talk to him again... then he wont talk about how you ignored him...|`|Prq0QuLfaa	dont ignore him
3BcvcJX9aa	She is a nut!  You need to deal with this now, or it will happen again!  Tell her that you are adults and to respect your privacy, and that you don't  want to talk about your sex life with her.|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	yeah totally|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	SUPER inappropriate!  Unfortunately I know some who talk like this too and I am not sure if it is to get attention, or if they have no manners!  You are in the right!|`|AA11193401	sure is|`|e65gCOWCaa	I personally find this hilarious. It's all relative really. Some people are highly conservative and find it inappropriate and other people who are more laid back will probably find it humorous. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, then those are your boundaries and don't feel bad for feeling weird. She was probably just trying to be funny and get close to you and that was her way of breaking the ice. Some people say crazy things like that just to let you know they're cool and laid back. Try not worry to much about because it won't even matter 6 months from now.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Wow, and, again...Wow  Your fiance really didn't know she could be that way???  Geez, that is sorta scary...  Maybe she has one of those complexes about her son -- ya know,  "no girl's good enuff for my son" and she's trying to scare you off.  Really, really rude and uncalled for.|`|5k9XizbMaa	OMG his mom's a whack job.|`|8e581713f59c039fe027d13dcc6d5f76aa	Yes!  It's inappropriate no matter what!!|`|Ex7hYU0laa	OFCOURSE IT IS!! That is not a suitable question for dinner time, fact it isnt suitable or apppropiate at all!!|`|ONMBbC16aa	Most definitely wrong. Psychopath...|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	yes , especially if dad got up, he suppose to stomache almost anything, and he got up?|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Wow...I can't even imagine what I would have said!  I probably would have choked too!|`|L2RqeYedaa	Wow that's really mortifying. Welcome to the family.   Though judged by the reaction of the other family members, they didn't think it was appropriate either. Maybe your future mother-in-law is a sensationalist. Or a nut, lol.|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	Some close questioning of your fiance regarding his mother seems in order before "almost wife" takes it any farther. He's got some explaining and justifying to do, and while he's doing it, watch him closely for any sign that he's explaining her or trying to excuse her. (Maybe her husband who left the table can lend some insight separately too.) I think you're smart enough to recognize a yellow flag when it raises. We all have relatives that embarrass us at the worst times, but this behavior is at best disturbingly inappropriate, and at worst an indicator that things between mom and son might be disturbing to find out about. Good luck to you all.|`|RPJlCHb9aa	yea thats really messed up for real for real|`|1iXvphNYaa	All depends on whether you all are humans or robots. I know his mom is human.|`|cEHhv7Emaa	yeah, she's a wench, he should have told her off.|`|HuhQbgG9aa	omg yes it is! thats real personal|`|0QEeXzOEaa	umm... too inappropiate to answer lol|`|RbSs7ll1aa	Well it is super awkward!    Good Luck!|`|6LibbJJXaa	Shyeah, well she's old, she'll let things slip. lol.|`|SlN6h3asaa	that is completely innapropriate and very irrelevant being at a dinner table! the dinner table is no excuse, his mom should never say a thing like that. It's just not right.|`|5fiMUkQHaa	omg wat kind of small talk is that i would say yes that is very innapropriate for anytime really|`|NWLxP3iEaa	tottally inappropriate  is she living vicariously?|`|AuthyG9Qaa	Y U P P... your mother-in-law is W E I R D.    Maybe you should have replied,    "Why do you ask?  Did THAT ever happen to you?"  bb|`|0MnTXjn8aa	wow, that must have been really uncomfortable for you both.  She may want you to be comfortable around her. she might have done it as an ice breaker. is she open with her children sexually? If so maybe she didn't think what she said was inappropriate.  some people don't think before they speak and they don't know how bad it sounds until it comes out of their mouth.   well if it were me i would have smiled and changed the subject.  i think you handled it approiatly especially for such an  inappropiate question.  Congrats on your engagment!
k9KJrjLxaa	I've asked this same question before to a guy (lol)  I was told that it's a very passionate, long, and sensual sort of thing. Lots of kissing and caressing and such.|`|MTwfByWVaa	Ignorance Is Bliss. Anyways, making out with someone includes putting your tongue inside their mouth, vise versa, and french kissing for a prolonged period of time. There are make-out parties, but that's how Mono gets to you. Really, it's supposed to be a romantic and passionate kiss, but culture these days have made it into a party favor.|`|AA11425983	It's like...intense French kissing for a long amount of time.|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	69|`|MWjNp6y3aa	It means to kiss longer than just a few seconds. Basically more than a quick kiss on the lips. Most people french kiss when they make out. Or at least I do. Yummy. Kissing rocks. Sorry I just got a little excited there.|`|6eGZGEw4aa	It is kissing, like some people said, for longer than a few seconds, but it's not just like a 5-second long peck.     It involves kissing with tounge and closed eyes and deep breathing.|`|ZUD25nA3aa	Like hugging each other really tightly and french kissing for a really long time.. it kinda looks vicious in a way.. LOL|`|yfZ5YSp4aa	it basically means as we call it in england snogging or french-kissing     it's when a guy kisses you and puts his tongue in your mouth and you basically stroke each others tongues :)     hope that cleared the air|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	very intense kissing tongue and all for a long period of tongue....touching and feeling is very often involved.|`|aMGfRum0aa	Okay... well it's when two people kiss passionately, normally longer than a quick kiss (meaning lasting for a few minutes). It usually involves their tongues touching or going into the other person's mouth. I hope this helps.|`|sXVkRGJIaa	The term ''make out'' means to exchange salivia with ones significent other i.e. shlobering allover each other.. funn
w7j8Qne6aa	Dad is the one that me and my brother are scared of... If he says something, it goes. If we go against what he says we get punished. Simple as.  Mum is the one that gets disappointed. If she says something, It can go, but of we disobey her she gets sad and we don't like it.  Generally dad's more strict. We rarely disobey him.|`|eAznKEEkaa	well it depends... sometimes its the mom and then sometimes its the dad. my mom is more strict.|`|1bfo3ujzaa	Used to be my father now for me i feel more shame when i disappoint my mother|`|AA12391059	why is this a poll of sorts or what? to me it doesn't matter who gives the punishment cuz its punishment just the same. but usally its mom.|`|8dZkyiTHaa	usually my dad. idk why but in the past 2 months he has been pms'ing or something because he is way more annoying
t2sTqzu9aa	It depends on how much really.|`|X4U36dHzaa	i don't mind if your a bit on the chubby side,more cushion for the pushion nothing wrong with that!|`|af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	Only if it's a little chubby, Not a lot.|`|cGoYd67Oaa	hot, skinny girls are what guys like|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	1. It's you, not your "friend".  2. Search up this question before you ask it!    Honestly! Sorry, but this question has been asked a MILLION times if you would just search it up first you would get thousands of answers.|`|NEEVRp16aa	When I meet a person it is the inner self I look at first.  I need a attractive person from the inside out.  The physical appearance is a part of attraction but an ugly attitude/behavior can make a 10 become a 3.  I know to a young/vain society this sounds old fashioned/goofy but I don't any choice on outer appearance.  Maybe age has made me wiser.........|`|v16ylsl8aa	Depends on the guys.   I used to be over-weighted, then skinny, and now in between. I'm on the curvy side with a flat stomach now. Well at all weights guys approached me. When I was skinny less guys approached, which was confusing for me. So it all depends on the guy. When I was 205 lbs (I'm 5'7) my boyfriend at that time was muscular and really loved my body and did not want me to lose weight. I did anyway. Shave off 55lbs. Less guys approached me =/|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Like 10 pounds or less is pretty cute, but depends on the person.|`|RPJlCHb9aa	real women have curves|`|ZUD25nA3aa	Apparently they do, it depends what guy, I'm skinny and the guy I'm desperately in love with is dating a fat girl, I swear she looks like she's pregnant!!|`|DHapsa7Daa	I hate this question really. Because, I'm not on the "perfect" side, but then again I'm not horrible. I've had many boyfriends, I've had boyfriends that I thought I can never get. I thought that I would never get a first kiss, or even have sex until I was in like my mid 20's, and I've been single MOST of my life. But, truth is if you let yourself down so much -- that's all you'll think.    YES, guys are all different just like girls. I LIKE my guys with meat on them, (not too much). I used to like them skinny and 6 pack and stuff. But, they turned out to be cocky. So, now I like guys that I can hug to and it's like a teddy bear. Seriously, everyone's different.|`|vWTC4iEyaa	There are no straight answers, depends on the guy; personally, chubby is good, Fat bad.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	I like girls who are HEALTHY. In other words, I like girls who have the right amount of weight on them for their body type and frame. Some girls are built tiny, with small hands and feet and skinny legs. More than a little bit of weight on them makes them look disproportionate. On the other hand, some women are built with more curves, creamy thighs, a nice round bum, larger breasts and... of course... more weight! On these girls a round and cuddly stomach looks better than a flat one. It's all about what's proportional for your body.    So in short: yes, guys love "chubby" girls if the extra curves look good on their body type.|`|VRHOdAgkaa	It depends on whom the guy is.    Most guys that i know like girls with a little chunkiness, but they usually like them for their personalities.    A large girl may be more attractive than a slimmer girl for her personality and maybe for various other reasons    A successful relationship is about their personalities, and they will always think the other is beautiful, what-ever the looks    Too be honest guys do like chunkiness though!! They go by the phrase "Junk in the Trunk" ha ha|`|LtJUrfAwaa	Guys are VERY different in their tastes. There are guys that like skinny girls and there are guys that like chubbier or "thick" girls. Have you seen married women? Yes, they aren't all skinny. It all depends on the guy you are going after. Anyone who is easy to make laugh is definitely someone who is easy to screw.|`|YvVTg4eFaa	Let's say that there is more to grab from...    But seriously, "LOVE IS BLIND"|`|U5d075o7aa	Some do.  Others dont.  We are all different.  Higher maintence guys mite like  a 10 [beauty, and body]  Less maintence mite  not mind body, but want a pretty face,  or vise-versa.  But a sweet man will not care of outer beauty  but of whats with in.      Nd its okay to be a little chubby by the way.|`|jXnxzbNEaa	well im a girl but i reckon if i was a guy id still have the same opinions on looks.    i reckon if shes pretty then its all good. and ive seen very pretty chubby girls, it almost makes them cuter! in general, slim is nice but i have definately seen exceptions.    and then theres the girls who it wouldnt even matter how they look because their personality is so gorgeous - the ones where it wouldnt make a difference if they were blue with pink hair! because their personality totally over-rides their looks|`|IvldxfQLaa	Black guys love big girls. White guys...not so much. they no if they bring a big girl home they moms would freak out talking about "holy **** i didnt make enough food for jumbo over there" lation guys...they like them round at the *** hips and ****. they dont gotta be skinny or have apps ya no. but there is such thing as a guy who...doesnt give a **** as long as u no when to stop eating and have a pretty face. so chubby but healthy (meaning she doesnt eat 24/7 but does eat) and has a pretty face that a guy can kiss|`|mQkvpnHDaa	Its the same if a you were asking somthing about a guy    ''Do girls like it if a guy is chubby?''    i would say chubby is ok if he is bloated and fat NO   i dont like big guys because its hard to feel compftable i like guys who have cute chubby faces  but i also love nice slim cheekbones on a guy i personally go for what he looks like in the face and voice
4b8124a893a203fc6fab1ecb088804edaa	Yo tampoco lo entiendo, mi novio es as, pero me dice que es porque pasamos mucho tiempo juntos, nos vemos como cuatro veces a la semana y yo pienso que si me amara de verdad le gustara verme todos los das, tal vez siente que caemos en la costumbre, pero si el pusiera mas empe?o de su parte no caeramos en ese fastidio que el crea. Quieren tiempo para ellos aunque no tengan nada que hacer y lo nico que me queda por pensar es que en esta situacin en que tu pareja se fastidia de estar todo el tiempo juntos es que en verdad no hay amor aunque ellos digan lo contrario.|`|AA11411121	Por pendejos...|`|AA11472903	Yo creo que estas generalizando.  No todos son as.    El trmino "me asfixias" lo he escuchado cuando la mujer no le permite ningn momento a solas al hombre.    A los hombres nos agrada de vez en cuando ir con los amigos a pasar el rato, o simplemente estar a solas con nuestros pensamientos. Un breve espacio para nosotros mismos.    Revisa tu comportamiento, probablemente estas siendo muy posesiva.  No es lo mismo una muchacha dulce, que una empalagosa.|`|feefdcf5db68bb219195ef7dc702da71aa	Si todos dicen lo mismo es probable que vos tengas que reveer algo... a todo en mundo en general cuando le prestan demasiada atencion dan por sentado las cosas... trata de hacerte valer un poco mas|`|8ff48dab64345ac5aeff4a99f6763f31aa	Yo pienso q ellos tienes diferentes formas de gustar o de amar xq cada rato quiere andar con diferentes tipos de mujeres y xeso los hombres no nos quiere tanto como nosotras queremos a ellos|`|69bca8d8a128544f386e4608e1c6f2bbaa	A ESA PERSONA NO LE INTERESAS, SOLO QUIERE TENER SEXO CONTIGO Y PRALE.

AA12349536	It sounds like she is trying to find an excuse to get back in touch with you! If it was lies that had caused the two of you to split the first time, then you should let her know that if she wants to start communicating with you again she should stop lying and playing games with you! If she is going to send you a text then she should let you know that she would like to talk with you or spend some time with you if you want to. Not treat you like you are stupid by acting like you tried contacting her when she knows good and well that you know you didn't! That's child's play!!!!!|`|AA12178793	Shes making an excuse to call you.  If you still care about her, then just accept the white lie sh'es using to talk to you and enjoy.  If you don't care for her anymore, then just ignore it.|`|AA12083470	Trust is everything in a relationship.  If you don't trust her, then I recommend you shouldn't be with her.  If she keeps bothering you, change you number and maybe move where she can't find you.  It does sound like a excuse to me, but maybe she got confused with the dates, thinking that you called her Wednesday, but it was actually two weeks ago.  Never can tell about these things.
fecbf408215596f591d1b18076b9611baa	Yes, you are still young and believe me what you feel for this boy is not love. You need to move on with your life, and definitely, for future reference, never be the "other woman". I hope this helps.|`|487e765df120692e02573936e6199892aa	Well, you're a lil early for a serious realationship in my opinion. He just wants to see what he can get from whoever, and so far, you must have been the to him. if you really love him, when he asks you, ask him why he left you and play hard to get. Leave him in the blue.|`|84d805564270fe227fe4698645de25e9aa	You are only in the 8th grade...you need to concentrate on your school work because you spelled grade wrong. You need not worry about boys right now; however, if you  really need some advise, leave them both alone because she is no real friend for rubbing him in your face and he doesn't care about you if he allows her to. Enjoy your summer and dont worry about old boyfriends and fake friends!|`|AA12319714	You sound like a sweet kid. Here's some advice for you: ditch BOTH of them. That's no friend, and if he's willing to swing back and forth between the 2 of you like that, it seems to me he's quite a selfish fellow. You're young and yes, you might love him, but you've got a whole long life ahead of you to live. A life where you don't have to take crap like this from anyone and you can just say, "You know, I don't need either of you" and walk away and find people who value your friendship and the love you have to give. I live in Florida too by the way, and it's a wonderful state full of millions and millions of people. You have plenty of exciting activities and places to go here and you'll meet plenty of great people while you do it. Tell Romeo you don't take sloppy seconds, and tell your so-called friend that she can have your leftovers. Good luck to you!|`|338683a7894d15ac4610ea5fd5c9c5c4aa	that is a little F'ed up i wouldnt talk to her|`|AA12217087	lol, my best friend did the same thing, except kiss, when him and i were dating, she would get this weird look on her face when he sat by me, but when i dumped him, 3 months later, they r going out. its weird is it not. lol. But maybe he will brake up with her and u guys will get back together. im sorry what uis happening between u guys, hoe it works out for the best|`|182761657b845b2721d856847ac493f6aa	dont br friends with the ***** shes nothing to u. shes rude and not a true friend. real friends dont do that stuff|`|AA11951307	you are in 8th grade...im sorry but you will meet immature girls til you are about 24(my current age)...don't be friends with her, you will have many others...and as for him if he loves you that much he can sacrifice the 2 day relationship 8th graders usually have...if not u will have plenty in the future...so dont worry!|`|AA11781916	you are still so young - apparently your friend isn't your friend or she wouldn't have done that to you - especially if she knew that you were still interested in him - what you need to do is have a talk with your friend - because apparently he's not into her - and he's into you - be upfront with her - be the mature one - even though your in the 8th grade - you don't have to act like a 5 year old - don't go behind her back and act ignorant - talk to her - and tell her you want to be with him - and apparently he wants to be with you

AA11998018	It is because of the atmosphere, I guess. Weddings are touchy for the single women and being without a partner at a wedding is sth fatal for us. It might have sth to do with that also... I mean you just need a date for that night because you don't want to seem pathetic :)|`|AA11286495	how many weddings have you been to that you can compare behavior in women?  If I had to guess, I would say that at weddings women often think about their own weddings one day, and it puts them in better moods? I have no idea.
33c340b860b553eb510934891e7ea54faa	it takes a lot to snort.... but most people laugh harder when they hear a girl snort. I've never h eard of someone thinking it was sexy but in todays world i wouldn't put it past someone.|`|AA10880581	I agree with the second one. There was this one time I was hanging with friends and this dude Shawn farts twice and we all crack up but then his girl snorts and we all laugh harder which causes him to fart again.  Point being it may pass as being funny to hear a girl snort if you laugh with her not point fun at her. and if you think it is sexy ur weird.|`|AA11708391	does she squeal at the same time,, then its funny|`|AA11249742	I find it annoying and really disterbing.|`|3b44be968e6a2d5843d9cf210f96fa05aa	no

Needless to say that later on,that BIG bootay was riding on my "car"(-;|`|AA10913368	yes I see nothing wrong with it as long as you get a smile|`|AA11046156	yeah i did once. naw the boy just looked at me real funny and then smiled. it was funny, but nothing happened, he didnt know any personal info about me, not even my name. so it was harmless. if he knows who you are though, theres a good chance that he will call you or something to ask about it, maybe even ask you out. But if you dont know who it is, dont give him any personal info about yourself, cause theres a lot of crazzy people out there these days...|`|AA12357220	ya i have done that soooooo much, its nothing compared to some things i do lol i give everything ive got to guyz lol|`|AA12398740	no but it was a car of 6 hot 18 year old guys!!  yummy

AA11988223	Well at least you are seeing some potential problems in the future....if you guys are seriously considering moving in together...he better get used to the idea of having you around and that every day may not be always so hunky dory, ya know?  People have problems and concerns...there is nothing wrong with this....it's called communication....something which a lot of people find themselves having a hard time with.  He has got to be there for you when you are going through something...that's just a normal thing that couples do for eachother....and likewise for you...you need to be there for him as well.  I think you should sit down with him and have a heart to heart....tell him your concerns and that if your going to be moving in together, this is a big step and one that shouldn't be taken lightly...the last thing you want to do is ruin your relationship, do what's best for the both of you, maybe it's just too soon to think about taking this step right now.  That doesn't mean that sometime in the near future you both can't reconsider it....Just a thought, I think a lot of couples are too gung ho on moving way to fast in situations like these and sometimes they don't work out just for this very reason.  Do some thinking and sleeping on it and talk with your boyfriend.  Hopefully you can come to a happy compromise!  Good Luck!!|`|AA11939205	if he doesn't have time for you now, he won't have time later when you move in and you'll always be miserable! he is supposed to be there for you and visa versa...|`|c8d736b9d841fb05f0429dfb18f6263caa	befor he dump u u just dump him|`|baf4a6f62abe40d2aa89fb41bcb1fd06aa	Well jus  make less time for him chill with other ppl he'll come around|`|9399a96fc31709e84c9ed6342522be80aa	if the relationship is really right shouldnt he love your company i dont know i cherish every minute i get with my boyfriend i just thought that was the way it was supposed to be|`|AA11132313	i will tell you what not to do - do not move in|`|5d9d64cb17b103d45fb4f6b067b03cebaa	i think its time to start looking again.|`|AA11740871	I think he just wants you to be more confident about you and you relations, not all the people like to hear from theor partners that they would die without them and such like things, on the other hand he is probably just tired after this hard week too:)|`|AA10552614	Go see a therapist and work thru this problem you have with insecurity of a man leaving you. If you read the bible, it will tell you the same, what you focus on will eventually happen to you.
AA11896909	I do but I thought I had found mine and I waited and it wasn't worth it but the feelings never went away.. He was so bad I had to make myself stay away..     So I just don't know anymore.|`|AA12041248	Yes ,because once you have found yours you will know. You think the same things even if you have never discussed them before. You just feel like you are one with them.|`|AA11051093	If soul mates is what you want to call it, yes I do.  I just think there is someone meant for everyone, because everyone deserves someone to be wtih.  If you think about  Noah's arc, There was a pair of every thing.  Everyone of them had a mate.  So if they are meant to have a partner, why aren't we all meant to have one?|`|85b18505bf6ecbd9c72feaefde13ffa6aa	Absolutely not.  There is no such thing as a soul or fate/destiny.|`|4a9b3d4543efd4bdcd1563c7de7cb84daa	i think that if things are going bad then it's great to blame someone so i want to blieve in fate cause right now mine sux!|`|AA11939205	I believe that you find someone who will make a lasting impression on you for the remainder of your life...regardless if you ever see that person again. Does that qualify as a "soul mate" to you?|`|AA11969333	Yes, and my last girlfriend I thought was my soulmate was the Devil in diguise!!!|`|AA10971402	yes but dunno why just do  i guess|`|AA11540698	i believe in soul mates...cuz i found mine. we we're going out for awhile and then things fell apart....now we're back to seeing eachother, but not all the time. we have more fun talking and just hanging out together now. he told me that no matter what would ever happen...he'll never give up on me again cuz he feels connected to me. i feel the same way about him. he's my best friend in the world.|`|AA10364316	yes because I am with him right now and he shows me every day that we are meant 2 be together!|`|AA10395610	i definatly believe in soul mates, but i also think that cosmicaly there is more than one match for a person. i believe you choose your own destiny and i dont think the godess would be cruel enough to predestine something like that, there are too many paths you may choose. when you meet one of your potential soul mate you will know.|`|AA11899121	No, I don't believe that at all.  There is someone out there for everyone but not a soul mate.|`|AA11534216	Yes, I do. Because I married my friend that I knew back in H/S. Now, were happily married with one child. If you belive dont let any one tell you different. If you belive thats good, but dont let anyone change your mind.|`|858b89a6eeb09e698c64321b7d4662bcaa	I think there is a soul mate for everyone. The reason for that is because I am a hopeless romantic and that God put someone on this earth for you to love and to spend yur life with.|`|d982803db67fc9c165ff26f522856dd5aa	not really..I feel you can find another person who compliments you and you them but that could be several different persons for various reasons.  the one you chose to spend more time with is just more complimentary than the others|`|b1fe15fc2252e0681b0ab8ffa323cba7aa	Yes, When there is unconditional love, there is your soul-mate.|`|AA12333753	No.  People are just so much alike to the point where they click very well.  They may have went through some of the same experiences in life, watch the same TV shows, or think the same.  That's what bonds people together.|`|add4cd193b74d4c8e0a9d67f06b0d68aaa	Yes.  Soul mates can be:  friends (finishing each other's sentences), lovers (automatic occurance - no effort needed), many many types of soul mates are out there.  Your cat may incarnate as your soul mate to keep you company, cos they know you are going to be lonely in a certain phase of your life, and they are good company so you don't feel so bad.    An interesting site.  Go to www.google.com and search for Elizabeth Prophet.  She deals with something called the Violet flame and she explains Soul Mates on her website.  I think her explanations are pretty informative and good stuff.      Another point...if you haven't already...make up your own mind.  Close your eyes and ask your body "what do you think about soul mates?"  If you listen carefully, and allow feelings and impressions to come to you (if you get freaked out STOP immediately.)  The body is intellegent.  I work in this field.  In my treatments, I take the time to introduce certain people to this theory.  Others know it, or aren't open to it.    Enjoy, and post your opinion!  Be interesting to read.    Cheers.  Namaste.

wpi36XBAaa	1. Talk to her. Find out what she thinks is the reason she "fell out of Love" with you.  2. Work on fixing 1.   3. If she says she doesn't know, then get some couple's counseling so that you can find it.   4. If you can't agree on what needs to be done, what needs to change, go back to 3.   5. Be aware of how you act, what you do and say around her, and about her.  6. Have conversations, not arguments.  7. Take the time to work on the relationship. If it took time to get off the rails, its takes time to get it back on track. Don't expect miracles straight away.  8. Be gentle with yourself. Mistakes were made on both parts. Beating yourself up isn't going to make it better. Accept responsibility, take charge and take action. Wallowing won't help.   9. Be aware that you may well love each other, but the way you show that love may not be the way the other needs to "feel" the love. She might be wanting you to put her first while you think working all hours is showing your love by getting her whatever she needs. Except she's missing the one thing she wants - your time. Learn what her "love language" is.  10. Respect her. If she needs space, give that to her. If she needs reassurance that you will be there for her, give her that.

I think U can figure this out for yourself really. Did she say she was out of love with U?  Make yourself indispensable to her. Do the housework and give her good sex. That is a combination no woman would turn down, And remember the sex has to be what SHE wants, not what feels good to a man -- that won't work. Foreplay has got to be sweet. Words have to have meaning. Back rubs and foot massages are a must have. Mix & match. Be sincere. Unless she has something better to go to, U might have a chance.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Hmmm, I will give it a try.    Buy her something nice  Take her out for a nice meal and dancing  Take her on a holiday  Tell her you love her  Give her a massage  Go see a counsellor  Deal with any issues you may have  Smile  Talk to her like an equal.

She hasn't left yet because in the back of her mind, she still has hope.  Be real...don't just tell her crap you think she wants to hear.  We're not stupid you know, we know when someone is genuine.  It's going to take time, and lots of it.  Talk...talk...talk...to each other.  Open your heart to her. Let her in.  Maybe she'd be interested in seeing a counselor, sometimes a third party knows what questions and discussions would help.  Try it...maybe there's still hope.  Good luck.|`|o1yy6KABaa	C-O-M-M-U-N-I-C-A-T-I-O-N    Ask HER what she wants. Only she can tell you
sr7jX2wYaa	Your an adult if you are in college, & if  this  is something you have always wanted to do, Go for it . I can tell you from experience, mom  might freak a  little  when she sees you, but  you are  her daughter, & she loves you regardless of your wacky ways, & she seems to have accepted your being gay,  So She  won't love you any less for following  your dream, ( So to speak) of shaving your head  for  charity.*|`|jDFEo7tWaa	Do it because you want to and because it's not your mother's hair. She's right about the "other ways to raise money" but it's your hair. Why do you ask her for permission anyway? You're supposed to make decisions for yourself now, and she has no say in what you decide. If you keep doing what she says, she may be ruling your life for a very long time.    You wanna do it? Go ahead. If you're lucky, you'll get others to join you for a good cause.    Since it's for Comic Relief, why not just shave part of your hair rather than the whole thin? Give yourself a nice hairless patch or something funny. Anyway, it's your hair, do what you want and forget about mom.|`|AA12391059	for charity that's really cool. our teacher did that in middle school if we raised a certain amount of charity. but think about a picture of you without Your hair. once its gone it wont be back for a while without a wig. try taking a picture of you, Photo shop it without your hair and see if that's the look you'll want for about 3 years to get it to shoulder length. or what you could do is grow it out for a wig foundation for people with  cancer. that is super sweet of you!

d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa	Guys are interested in girls who are interested in them, regardless you're a virgin or not.|`|ZlEUdQnpaa	The answer unfortunately is both.  Men are complex creatures.  With some exceptions most guys have fantasies about virgins in one breath and complain about having to initiate everything in the next.    It also depends what the girl is looking for in a relationship.  If she wants someone who will stick around she should hold out.  Although   playing too hard to get will make you an un-gotten girl.  He may just give up.  He may find a more willing partner.  Then your'e lucky you didn't waste it on a low-life.  On the other hand if you're a girl who "just wants to have fun," go for it.  but just remember the heart can feel an emptiness in the end.  In short, your seemingly simple question has complicated possibilities.|`|a3bdb9b6c5443aab045d85800a41063caa	some guys want it some guys don't usually the ones who want it have bad intentions or are very religious. but a lot of guys want some one experienced not very experienced but with some.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Something inbetween.    Virgins are virgins for a reason, And "more experience" means you are too easy.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	it depends on the guy  some dont mind that your experienced  as long as your not too experienced (a lot of guys)  and some would rather you be a virgin|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	it depends on guys. i love virgin girls as i am also a virgin.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	A lot of it depends on your age. If you are in your 20's, and still virgin, a lot of guys would wonder what is wrong with you. Otherwise, it's a toss up, some preferring experience, some preferring to supply the experience.     But until you are ready to have sex with someone, it is none of their business, whether you are virgin or not.    This, of course, doesn't apply if you live in Afghanistan. There, if you aren't virgin, your are dead.|`|wKjxESbBaa	thats stupid there is no such thing as a virgin anymore??? ur crazy|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	jhl|`|AA11540024	it can be both. With a virgin when a guy is bad the girl wont really know better and they might feel like they're special since they happen to be your first.    Experience is good for a guy so the girl knows whats going on.|`|YNPnAwFNaa	I'd say it depends on the guy, but if you're in a serious relationship [in love] then he probably would want you to be a virgin, so if it happens between you both, it'll be special.|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	it depends on the guy really...some guys prefer virgins, some don't...but alot of guys like to know that they are your one and only you know the first one to hit the jackpot...but what you should know is after a guy has sex with a girl and takes her virginity he has no obligation to call her the next day or even speak to her again so BE VERY CAREFUL alot of guys are dogs and couldn't care less if ur virginity is sacred to you or not.|`|RAyRGH1Saa	it all depends upon the guy    help with the last question i put up?|`|igBds5Lhaa	All men any age would love to have a virgin sit on their C**K for the first time but as far as preferring a virgin NO because that means that at any age we are we would have to go for the 13 to 16 year olds lol.

Ow6lKFXiaa	Because they are so close to you, this is hurting you more than youre willing to admit.  You are sweet to not want to hurt your friends feelings by saying anything, but they are hurting you.  They dont realize it, but they are showing absolutely no respect for your opinions, thoughts, or feelings.      The next time they belittle you, interrupt and gently say, Excuse me, I have something important to say and I need you to listen.  Ive never said anything before because youre my closest friends I didnt want to make you angry.  When you say something silly or that I dont agree with, do I put you down?  No, because I respect your opinions and quirks.  They are part of who you are as people and  what makes me love you as my friends.  I may not be the smartest person around, but Im not stupid.  When you put down my opinions and mistakes, you make me feel really stupid and worthless,  like you dont care what I have to say or how I feel, Im just a joke to you.  I just cant keep quite anymore, you have no idea how much this hurts me.     They will probably be stunned that you stood up for yourself and, its possible they may even be angry that you spoke to them like that.  Theyll see a part of you theyve never known before and wont know how to respond to.  But friends do have disagreements, they get over it. You cant just keep laughing this off.  This hurt will eat away at you until you decide to remove yourself from its source, your friends.  You will always regret this.    I was just like you once; So insecure of myself as a person that I tolerated the teasing, jokes at my expense, and the put downseither ignoring them or laughing them off just as you do, but crying when no one could see.    One day it suddenly dawned on me that  I was worth more than those around me believed.  I was a good person, had honest opinions, and interesting ideasI had value.    As hard as it was, I held my head high and began standing up for myself, expressing my opinions, and letting those close to me know how they made me feel.   It took a while, but it changed my life for the better.     You need to discover yourself, who you really are, and hold your head high, not just to your friends but with everyone you come in contact withespecially yourself.|`|YweMJm2Eaa	okay, same thing happened to me.   my friend was treating me EXACTLY like that.   so i took in her cr*p for 3 years and then i was like..f*uk it.  so now i like to give my opinion even if its not the same as hers.  and when she starts giving me that attitude, i give her one back.  and i let her know that I'm just giving her my opinion and not to get a fit bout it. so now when i speak up and give her my opinion about something, she knows better not to judge me.   i hope that helps.       :]|`|xLYRdAc6aa	wow,i had a similar issue.  my friend would constantly hit me,she thought it was those funny punches.  but boy,she was really strong.  and i do agree,i actually told her i didn't want to be her friend anymore.  and now it's VERY awkward when we see each other in the halls.  the best way would be telling them to knock it off when they tease you.  say it with confidence and determination,like you are really ticked.  but don't sound too mad,they might react offensively.  try "i'm not stupid,i just was drifting off." or "well i like that part,maybe you need to watch it again to appriciate it."  they soon realize that you need space and stop teasing you.|`|WAzNGAL6aa	My friends have done similar to me and I am far from a moron and they know that and your friends know the same about you. But it never bothered me. I always laughed with them at myself. It has always made things more fun and interesting. My friends and I are each so different from one another and laugh at each other quite often. It's a good thing to be the one who brings laughter to the group.   But, if this really bothers you, you should talk to them. What are best friends for if you cant tell them how you feel? But, I wouldn't sweat it to be honest, they seem to be loyal friends who care about you. Have fun! Even when others treat you as if your dumb, YOU know the truth and that's what matters. If you do decide to confront them don't let it turn into a problem between you all.|`|lUyNM5uiaa	Next time they say something like that don't agree with them but try saying, "So? Is there something weird about it..?" and kind of act like you're hurt. If they really care about you, they will stop and wonder and reflect on how you may be feeling when they treat you like this.     This helps you're friends conform to being a better friends.  All these years you never defended yourself, and it's great that you have your own opinions (like the music video example) and can speak for yourself instead of living in your friends shadows.     It's awkward and uncomfortable to just talk to your friends about this so it's great to just answer them next time in a way they never expect. It gets them by surprise and it really wakens their senses to respect your feelings.|`|8b223213bf4fad7bd69b5aba849b7174aa	Even I face the similar issue at times. It is difficult to find a definitive answer and the answer may be subject to failure but I can write it anyway.    Actually, good friends laugh with you NOT at you. Little bit leg pulling is Okay but make sure that they do NOT mock at you making joke of something serious.    Next time they laugh at you show them that you are feeling hurt and bad.  Or if it is something serious they laugh at tell them " I would like to leave" then they would pay attention to you "Oh! What has happened?" If they do not do it immedietly and continue laughing then just walk out. Then they will come behind you, then you can make an agreement that they will not laugh at you.   If they do not try to make up even if you show that you have felt hurt, then just ignore them.  But, If they are your friends they will surely make up.  Good Luck. :)|`|9xc7eVvGaa	You're gonna have to tell them how you feel. they can't stop doing something that bothers you if they don't know it bothers you...if they are the truly great friends you say they are they will understand.|`|QDP61e92aa	if a friend is teasing you they are not being a true friend , if they do it again just say"you guys are bugging me i hate it when you make fun of me so could you please leave me alone for once" then either walk away or just change the subject|`|Prq0QuLfaa	Tell them all of this

Not the length of time you've known each other.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	3 days ,,,, make sure he is a man, and not a dike|`|RAGAcJV7aa	no its crazy. you dont nothing about him or enough in three days. give yourself time be patient and take one day at atime .if s it meant to be then it will happen|`|zadtCE1paa	haha go for it|`|j430ynCjaa	Are you kidding me?|`|LPKWYbihaa	Not a good idea...|`|GqlLcRWtaa	NO NO AND NO  get to know him more............ give it another month or 2|`|lyhnHhuWaa	If you're not certain enough to not have to ask this question then it's not a good idea.  I've only known of one couple who married quickly and had it (sort of) work out.  They married after knowing one another two weeks and have been married almost 25 years.  Of course, they have a shitty marriage and they fight all the time.  I think they're just both too stubborn and dependent on one another to let it go.  Looking at your avatar, I'm pretty sure that you're more in love with the idea of being married than you are with him.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Act in haste repent at your leisure. Do you know his name yet, you might need that at the ceremony.|`|44QPXU5eaa	What are you serious????    LOL that is not good hey, is it an arranged marriage cos no one in there right mind would marry someone they do not know|`|ULI3f5YEaa	ok.. you have only known the guy for 3 days. what if hes a molester or something?  he could be a rap est  you don't actually know him. I mean come on. I'm not trying to be mean. But get to know him better before you go through that. Divorce is a lot of money to pay for if it doesn't work out. I'm just trying to help you out. I wouldn't even spend the night at someones house if i only knew em for 3 days. :) thanks|`|0EK1cQthaa	I would not call this a good idea... but if its what you want then go for it. I think you are missing some of the great things that help build a good foundation for a relationship though. You are going from nothing to everthing, basically, and even though you could be happy you wont get to go back to the whole courting thing. You probably arent used to the fights, or how he will react, or how jealous he can be, or how well he listens... along with many other things. You will also be missing out on many of the good things, such as talking on the phone from the night until early morning, or making every second of the date you have together because you wont be able to see him later on because he has to go back to his place or you need to go back to yours and leave for something important in the morning. Maybe you already live together or would anyways, so that wouldnt matter as much, but it is still fun. When you have the shorter amount of time together, where you treasure every moment, it will help build up to the big day when you will be with eachother forever. It will mean more when you wake up with him the next morning and know that he is not going to leave your side. What about future plans, what do you both want, and how are you going to get to them?    You don't have to figure out everything right now, but don't rush. If he is worth waiting for then wait a little while longer. See what he would be like to date outside of marriage besides the three days you have known eachother.     Fights are bound to happen in marriages. When you do, look back to how wonderful the days were before the marriage and how he treate you, then how good the marriage became, and then how he was until now. When people become angry they tend to focus only on the bad things, so when you have more happier things to focus on from a wider timeset and from different angles, you will most likely calm down faster and be happier. Besides, if you do have children you can tell them all about your dating with their father when they start into the dating game. If you guys want a life to yourselves, you can go to the beach and linger over past times.    Just don't jump into the water when you don't know what is in it or the temp! Good luck hon, and I'm sorry if this was wordy. I just want you to make the right choice. Make the choice that YOU think is right for the BOTH OF YOU.|`|TSxbN0Asaa	First off I don't think you are for real and second if you have to ask people on yahoo answers if you should marry this guy then the answer is NO.|`|AA11678629	DID YOU TWO MEET AT A MENTAL HOSPITAL|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No its not a good idea to do that's just plain crazy.    After 3 days there is no way you know everything about him.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	It is a very very bad idea.   Go straight for marriage counselling NOW before Friday, otherwise that's where you will end up.  How can you know someone in 3 days?|`|hs793CCxaa	Well, you sound as smart as each other......    From your profile, we know you are at least 12.....but just not too bright. I thought you were a troll.     You are planning to spend the rest of your life with someone you met three days ago??    If someone asked you this question, how would you answer??    What's his family like? Might his Uncle molest your kids? Maybe the rest of the family are in prison... Maybe he wants your money or an easy regular lay.... Maybe just too many things! Dumb idea.     At least you won't be bucking the current divorce  trend!|`|M4X3HOV5aa	it's perfectly fine. i'm sure things will work out.|`|CM0C65dtaa	I think that's a terrible idea.  I got married in 4 months and I thot that was fast.  What's the rush?|`|fzIeGPZYaa	typically speaking that is one of the worst ideas you could possibly think of, however, i DO know of an older couple that met as teenagers and were married within a few days; they are still together many years later!!! so is it a good idea? no, but anything can happen!!! good luck with your life|`|8PvqsOt8aa	Good idea for who, maybe for you but not for all, hope you know what you are doing|`|AA12204338	no, very very stupid|`|jfhP8PCIaa	Well,if you have already planned for your wedding it seems to me you have already mad up your mind.

e65gCOWCaa	Yes and no. The song is REALLY about finding love for the first time, being separated, and reuniting again. The virginity thing is whatever you want to interpret it as. Yea, in most cases when teenagers find love for the first time, they lose their virginity's to each other. But, I don't think that's the exactly what Deana Carter was trying to imply in the song.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	I think so.|`|GeHxekEMaa	ITS ABOUT FALLING IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME NOT ABOUT LOSING JUST HER VIRGINITY ALTHOUGH THAT MOST LIKELY HAPPEND|`|UtrgRjTeaa	Not necessarily. The song's more about the emotions she felt than the physical sensations. It implies that there was some necking in his car, and the "loss of my innocence" could be interpreted either figuratively (meaning virginity) or more literally (meaning now she knows what love is like) but there's nothing to outright suggest that they did or didn't have sex.|`|S852p6SXaa	yeah i think its about a girl who meets this boy they fall in love and th their first time was near the river bank-they were both seventeen at the time. as they got older they started to drift apart but what really made them really drift apart  when the boy decided to go off to college. but that was a long time ago but every once in a while she thinks of him and the place where they first met.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	Yes it is.|`|Rnsk3ULiaa	yeah it is. i used to sing this song in like 6th grade with my friend b4 we realized that. its such a pretty song :)|`|Br38OspXaa	it's about her first time falling in love, yes it may include losing her virginity, it may not, but it's about her being in love|`|FbTqb3uUaa	It sounds like it. Especially since she talks about the loss of her innocence, which usually has to do with losing your virginity.|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	yes it was|`|AA11553531	i believe it refers to falling in love.|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	Yes, that what "the loss of my innocence" means.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	its sounds like it... or it could actually just be about drinking wine lol. it depnds on how you translate it
ixvzhoGUaa	It sounds like you're getting a lot of opinions from other people, but the real person you should be talking to is Him ! i think you should tell him that you really like him, and you were wondering if he felt the same way ! you can get opinions from as many people as you want but in the end, he is the only one who knows the truth about what he's thinking and how he feels. good luck =]|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	v,|`|dTt2gyJgaa	he probably is just really shy...seems like your going to have to take charge w/t a guy like that....he probably really wants you too , ask him to hang out|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	he might like you, he is a dude.|`|lCkctFT8aa	friend him on facebook, myspace, or aim and talk to him a lot, both there and in school. eventually you'll become sorta-friends and then friends and then, who knows? but just talking to him a lot and showing to him that you think he's special and different from any of the other guys means a lot.|`|dUJjM4ucaa	obviously he likes u... i mean every time you asked someone, the signs pointed to YES.. girl.. pass it round that you like him, and he will come running.. just don't ask him out.. i don't believe in that.. the guys are supposed to ask the girls not vice versa|`|fG4dMAr7aa	;)...it depends how old are you.. :)....if your under the age of 108 then he hates you...rofl...(sarcastic)|`|oSRVsV3naa	heyy !! i think your friend is right hes just too shy to admit his feelings . .. . . hes into you =) lol hope that helped|`|x7rv7MH1aa	okay, ive done dat bofore too...tld a boy i luv dem as a joke...n most of dem took it seriously...but since he would like to kiss u..n doesnt tlk to u after dat...da reason he doesnt is because he knows if he would he would start blushing...but i think he likes u...

RqQ0K32Baa	Well I have friends from all sorts of cliques, I just become good friends with one of them and then you meet their friends and you'll become friends with them and so forth. And then you have exciting new people!  I actually got to be friends with lots of the opposite sex from my ex. We would hang out in groups and stuff. And I met the boy I'm basically with now because of him.|`|vbQtLPT4aa	Easy just be you! And joins sports and groups which can lead to awesome convo's.|`|825892c587d1ea5ddc6075b76de11625aa	NO!

If you are in middle school, you have a problem.  1-school is getting harder, you are learning the basics for your trade or occupation.  2-your hormones are changing your body and your mind.          these are 2 very powerful distractions.

Bring grandma some flowers & some chocolate for grandpa (grandma will eat them too) Be on your best behavior & ask them if you can "go steady" with their grand-daughter.  Don't forget: if they like you, the sky will be the limit!|`|eab903271d305c99b8ce06a5a06ad5f2aa	first of all, if you have been dating for a year and only gone out once, she is not your girlfriend.if you are under the age of 16 i can see why it may be difficult, but if you want to be with her, you need to find as way. i take it her grandparents are very protective, so you need to kiss their butts. if they like you, they will begin to trust you. if it really means something for you to be with her, go for it, try anything you can, but my real advice is to find someone close to home and have a real girlfriend. you are probably young and will kick yourself in the butt later for wasting all this time. i really doubt this is the girl you will be with for the rest of your life.|`|AA10221073	Grandparents like parents can be hard to get alone with, they think ur after one thing. May be u should meet her grandparents and let them see that ur a nice guy, play on they're goodside and may be they will allow u to take her out. But make sure that u never do anything thats gonna mkae them dislike or trust u if u should meet and win them over.
AA11327718	Have a specific idea to show you've actually given this some thought.  Sometimes a somewhat indirect approach is less stressful for both of you.  For example:  "I have 2 tickets to the ___ concert and was wondering if you would like to go with me"    If she says yes, you could follow up with something like: maybe we could get some dinner before the show.      Hmmm.. but you didn't mention your age, so this may not work for you (like if you don't have a driver's license yet)  :-)|`|AA12291390	HI, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT ON A DATE SOMETIME?|`|AA11524018	get her laughing, then ask if she'd like to have a drink or maybe lunch sometime|`|AA11099835	Ask her if she would like to have dinner with you.|`|AA11125526	Just walk up and be like "If you lost a little weight you'd look like Ricki Lake"  Then club her and drag her back to your cave...|`|AA11692878	go slow  start by bieng her friend  then after a while ask her out

But not to sound cliche, it takes two to tango...If you both are going back and forth on the situation it probably won't work. The next time he calls tell him flat out that if he's so worried about what his friends think then he should stop calling. It sounds like he's got some maturity issues.  If he's just going to keep calling and confusing you, honestly tell him to stop. It'll be hard but better for you in the long run if you can make a clean break. GOOD LUCK!|`|7899cacab4b7d58792fe9313a85c502eaa	No! If you still love this boy then don't give up on yall tell him how you feel and tell him not to worry about what his friends think cause they won't be the ones dating you. They're probably just jealous and wish that they can have someone or they probably feel that you're taking their boy away from them. So don't give up and call him right now and let him now how you feel.

I would not however suggest that you search on the internet for your Mr Right.  Good Luck|`|AA10755492	Hi Grace,  First, I am not sure if you are fishing or feeling...  But I will give you the benefit of the doubt and will treat your question as you have a real feeling here, a true desire of finding true love in life.  Well, Grace, won't we all? That is what the greaaatest majority of people in all world is looking for... true love.  How can you know that you found true love? Many people thought they did but then they discovered that they didn't. So true love, in my opinion, exists, but watch it out! it is not "perfect love".   You need to make this distinction about what you are looking for. You may find true love, but not perfect love, because this kind of love (perfect) doesn't exist in anyone human, but God.  So, since you are thinking of the love of God, here are some tips for you to enhance your chances to find "true love".  1. Do not look to hard. Let it come to you. Sometimes, life is way wiser than us and it can take us to or bring true love to us.  2. Look for people with good heart. Although "bad boys" are capable of true love, their love comes along with lots of problems and "not-love" for other people. So...  3. Give a chance to friends. It is a myth that good friends cannot be good lovers. There are lots and lots of good friendships that became real love. And, what if there is this friend of yours that it is a good friend and all and just can't reveal his crush on you?  4. Love is about to give. So do not expect to find true love in people that are selfish in their caracter. We all are selfish here and there, but there are people that can't help being selfish all the time. Be away from these kind of people.  5. Learn about love, define to yourself what is "true love", so you may recognize when you see it.  I hope these tips can help you. I have experienced true love, but not perfect love (besids God's love). And because it wasn't perfect, it didn't last. It has happened lots of times.  Good lucky.|`|AA12326346	i think ur search ends here,i m also looking for a girl like u.plz click on my pic and mail me ur contact details.    u can visit my profile also    http://www.hi5.com/friend/displayProfile...|`|AA12120714	Most every young woman as yourself wants to find their "man" and to be loved as you stated.  I wish you the best in your search.  I must say looks can make a difference we are all attracted to certain kind of people....sometimes it's "love at first sight"....it does happen that way sometimes. How about the people who meet on line ? Their minds meet first!  Before they even see each other by cam or photo.. that is taking a chance so you have to be careful ...but we all have to be careful even out from behind the computer....think of your culture and your deep beliefs and the way you like to live..either liberal or conservative make sure you end up with someone who shares the same views because you can't change them ....each person is cut from a different cloth...and you can't patch it...

I'd probably need more details, bu if you love this person dearly, and you feel that they're issues can be worked through then it might be worth continuing the relationship. As long as you know that these issues may be there permanently and you feel you are able to handle them in a healthy manner, then there should be no problem.

AA11827342	if it's love you can't 'blow it' or do anything wrong because it will happen. so go for it. Ask for a date and see what happens. You're screwing yourself up in knots and it's really quite simple. you won't die if he rejects you or it doesn't work. It may hurt a bit but you'll get over it and move on. If it does work then won't you be glad you asked him. So email him right now and say 'how about a proper date?' See what destiny has in store for you.|`|AA11200878	DO IT...

It doesn't make her relationship material and it doesn't mean she's not.  It means that she is dating more than one person until she can find the one to settle down with and have a real relationship with. There is nothing wrong with that, because as I said, that does not mean she is sleeping with all of these people.|`|AA10228553	There is nothing wrong with dating more than one person at first, but once one of the relationships starts to get serious it's time to choose.|`|7e952f6cad4d9278fbf8c29369988903aa	Usually, you can tell what a person is going to be like after they get married while they are still dating. if you have a pattern of cheating or getting mad over dumb stuff, you can expect to see more of that after you get married.    I think, and this is just my opinion, that if a person does not want to be with me and me alone, then they don't deserve me. Good thing my boyfriend finds me interesting and intelligent enough to hold his interest, and love me like I should be loved.

I guess that depends a lot on who you're talking to. :/    I think I'd keep using the word friend around them as much as possible to try to get the point across.    As in, "I'm so glad that you are my FRIEND."  If they mention anything other than friend...quickly correct them.  After that if they're confused and ask why you did what you did..well..sex=sex that's just what it is. Sex does not necessarily mean love or anything of that sort. I guess the best thing to say is exactly how you think of it... "It just happened"    It's an awkward situation to be in, but it seems to be quite common.

be7de9d4ba67319fec1a612620ef7166aa	Yeah.  I'm really sorry this happened to you because it's rude and immature.  But look, the fact of the matter is that real friends don't talk about you behind your back like that.  Only your enemies should do crap like that, you shouldn't have to worry about your friends doing it.  Any worthy friend is not going to put up with listening to that in the first place, they would stick up for you, not engage in it (whether actively or not).  If your friend acts like it's okay for your other friends to talk about you behind your back then that's not a true friend.  Your boyfriend (is that what you meant by your partner??) should stick up for you, too, and if he doesn't he's a real jerk.    I'd tell them to f' off.  Just be strong and stand up for yourself, even if no one else will.

2253307a6cde390091d89f22e97b600daa	Let go of it.  Accept that you are not responsible for it and that some people are schmucks.  There is no guarantee in life that one or both parents aren't one of these schmucks, and just because they bore you doesn't mean they are infallible.      Observe people who behave as you wished your father had.   Use them as your fatherly role model.  Being aware that you might have insecurities and a lack of trust for men should allow you to avoid having it bias your thoughts and actions.  You're already over the hump, you recognize what is right and wrong, wake up tomorrow and let yourself be free from his influence entirely as it seems there was very little that was positive in your relationship.|`|d18e88aa7a76031ffdaca14e56e08e98aa	Well, you acknowledge the problem. So now you need to figure out exactly how that influence manifests.    It's not going to be easy, though, because your actions are a hybrid of his influence, your mother's influence, and your own decisions and feelings -- as well as the influence of everyone else you've ever known. Weeding out his influence is, in short, impossible.    So here's what you do instead: when you're feeling like a negative influence (no matter what the source) is guiding your thoughts or actions, stop, sit down, and write down or talk about what you're feeling at that moment. Try to analyze why you're feeling that way, and take control of it. You may end up doing the same thing, or not, but either way it will be a conscious decision you've made instead of a reflex -- and if it's a conscious decision, it's your choice, not your father's influence, that drove the decision.|`|AA12198827	I have been through hell and back when I was a child.

You are right. the first couple days are great but then I have to separate my children ( meaning my 8 yr old and her 32 year old father ) They fight like cats and dogs. Then when my daughter wants something and i say no. She just goes to her dad knowing he will say yes. When I ask him why he does this it pretty much tells me he is trying to get the best father award by letting her do what I don't let her do. Why they do this I don't know.

If he's gorgeous and he's wearing tight baseball pants, oh good lord, watch out!|`|f6d05022878beaaf3a85b7567ae724daaa	cuz u r not enough for her FOOL|`|AA12174221	because she wants you, fool|`|be3ca971c3996aa50fa2b54015193ed8aa	It doesn't do much for me, but, others may find that attractive.|`|AA11954844	Nope...doesn't do anything for me. I think she just wants to talk to you about sex....maybe she would like your relationship to go in that direction?|`|AA10998892	Hell yeah ...hot sweaty men, i'm getting hot and bothered just thinking about it...|`|AA11626755	Mmmm...if it is full-contact like hockey or lacross? Yeah, most definately!|`|AA11534512	I prefer my men clean, sweat free and smelling good.|`|176754993206b10c8a424e29466b1e5aaa	Depends. Volleyball yes, soccer no.

23ee7b4d32a58068a620c078fb648824aa	I'm planning my weekend already. All i see is rest and relaxation in store so my s.o better just hang out with his boys and let me do my thing!!
f732d4269c8d4b4a36ee3ce876a4d2d5aa	Are you trying to impress your dates with cash?  That's just wrong.|`|AA11850056	I carry very little cash at any time and always carry my Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards.|`|AA11103696	Usually $50.00 per date, rarely spend that much, but always prepared    Same amount for pretty or average|`|AA12196704	I carry enough money to get home if my prince turns out to be a troll because if you invite me out . I'm not paying|`|AA11079935	nope always the same amount and i dont try to show off either between $3000 & $5000 thousand i dont like to rely on credit cards and never know what i might feel like doing i keep $200.00 in one pocket and the rest in the other pockets, and i never pull out that much money infront of her, i dont want her to want me for money i just want to show her a good time|`|b0f7050f07a19715578cea121daaefefaa	I wish I had $3000-$5000 in my pocket all the time.    All you need is enough money to make sure she doesn't have to pay. However, you don't have to pay all the time. See if she ever offers. You can always say no, though. Work it out in your head to see how much you will be spending and bring a little extra.
9ecd19017c1b945bb03aab30e4140e05aa	I can't remember exactly how long after the loss of my love that I began seeing others. However, I do remember the awkwardness of spending time with new people. I was no more selective the second time than first. Keeping your standards high as to the type of others as worthy human beings you include in your inner circle will save you in the long suit.|`|AA12082377	More selective absolutely!  I'd say around a year before I really accepted an invitation to go anywhere, I had to come to terms with the situation.|`|AA11256610	It took me 6 months, BUT I knew the guy already- we were friends for a long time before my husband died.  Then it turned into more.  But I think we both liked it as friends more- so we are back to that again, and don't feel awkward about it either.  Some of our friends don't know what to make of it- it's kinda funny really...Everyone is different and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!|`|AA11861877	i am recently divorcing after an eight year marriage, we have been separated now since the end of December. I still am not dating.|`|4f460879694eedb088630d8b70cd2b8caa	It depends on how long you were married and if you really loved the person, by that i mean were you still "in LOVE" or did you just love the person.  every one is different,  It was 2yrs before I started,  Just keep in mind a new person has different thoughts and ideas.  They  will never live-up to your ex (if they have passed) and /or they might not be as messed up as your ex.  If you date right after don't make the new person pay for the previous spouse actions.  you chose to date so be ready.      that's just my suggestion|`|AA10795971	1 year.  Unfourtanely, after dating around, I found another guy just like my ex, so now I'm taking a hiatus.  I've been divorced for 3 yrs.
af74d67a19fcb11578cb0fd97f94bde3aa	Try to ignore them.  I also try to ignore spelling and grammar errors.|`|80195a215f1e838a3359ff018f06d4d5aa	know|`|AA11783179	Avoid them at all cost...|`|AA10934379	Mess with them. When they start spouting off pretend what they are saying is something that you've known since you were a baby. Say "well yeah" and look very bored. When they probe you with deep questions to test you, complain that they don't care about the real issues like the starving children in Africa.Take every oppurtunity to point out mismatched clothes or other common sense things like that. If that doesn't work challenge them to a duel with water guns and put Nair in your gun instead of water.   Or just be nice and treat them as nicely as you would anyone else.|`|8429901c99f57805c383344df7e5c34daa	Pretend you can't understand what they are sayin.........no matter how hard they try to explain =)|`|cc3f6d950d7818c0b73f52210960524faa	dont hang out with them if u dont like them...|`|b36663270e82fceb888e4311ed2d97b3aa	My full and proper name is just fine for me.

a57866c69f5c7e2dc2febff1b13d8967aa	I love women in general... but oriental girls in glasses drives me insane!!!! Love 'em!|`|AA11910385	Most species work well with variety...      Oriental girls appear younger and often fun.  Whilst some are seen as submissive and easy...    Others can be seen as fiesty and wild.    Appear to be nice and affectionate.      There are different...|`|abe6b0d8f0f42f7eaf3e20912fafd4a0aa	cause they are pretty!|`|AA12368153	coz they  know the art pf sucking di*k,  and thier  pu*sy smell good, and not fishy like other girl's. ha ha ha ha ha ha|`|814c26e99d1883022f93b2b4faf03407aa	Because oriental girls have slanted eyes, so it looks like they are constantly cuming during sex.|`|AA12186391	because western woman have chips on their shoulders, are all about themselves and oriental girls are fun and dont take themselves too seriously..plus they look hot!|`|50728e036c06ca5f20645904e6dcee27aa	There are two reasons firstly eastern women posess their own beauty that is different to the western style and Eastern women are perceived (and more often true) as having been brought up to devote their life to their husband. Western women now have their own independent careers and lives this makes a relationship with a western woman high maintenance because both partners often have very different goals. With eastern women their is usually only one goal set by the man. For most guys this is what they ultimately want from their partner. To a man this behaviour is seen as a total expression of respect trust and love. They cannot find what they define as true love with western women. (these are generalisations and we have come a long way in changing gender roles but the concepts we are changing have been in place for thousands of years and our subconcious mind takes a hell of a long time to shake off that much propaganda)|`|00170be4e82fc8514c0eeccd302f21deaa	Well I have lived in Hong Kong for many years, and the reason I discovered is that they are good natured, generally slim (small boobs though) they do not have any 'attitude' (yet) and generally the young girls like older men !! Hope this helps answer your question. I also like oriental girls-and I am a woman !!!-My reasons......... well they are private !!!|`|29e295cec0c873a18c6c48d163ad9617aa	Have you seen the girls I work with?  If you had ... actually, it's just three of them ... but you'd see why.|`|a9b05b40cabba32919f2b7be784be7e0aa	Because they love you long time|`|e43dee31ff538120cbb215bc99038b8baa	my boyfirend likes oriental girls but won't tell me why.  and whats sad is I'm white.|`|6ef765c39d91da7786a0e0ef259ae209aa	Probably because ori?ntal girls have a different kind of beauty and elegance. This has to do with their natural petite-ness. The other, cultural, attractiveness is in the respectful way they treat men. Men can get very fed up with western women, who can be very direct, demanding and bossy. Men who like ori?ntal women like them, because they can be in charge (they think).|`|6d97c9aa6b7bec839573b464e44a9d8daa	In order to become sha-ling preist you must ask such crazy question you already know answer?|`|1389928058cd38ac76b7c8393be5ddf4aa	Because some oriental guys like western girls. And some western guys like western girls. And some oriental guys like oriental girls.|`|7fdb18ee589d9674089517e82f52a3d4aa	why do u want to know?
AA12352621	tell your brother how you feel. tell him everyone likes him bar you so there must be a problem or something. explain everything and include that its upsetting you because you cant get on with the relationship without his blessing..if he still doesnt come round block him out. who needs him!|`|8f2d2205f9cbef5b90a1b74f106a5318aa	why dont you just write a book while you are at it...just ask a question okay.dont have a sister.|`|2ca90a8d5fe8a851bf0b47613006e3ddaa	Of course it your decision, not his. Just ask you brother what so wrong about your b/f that is bothering him! It's just a ego thing:)
2052e18fc0d72841570806264391dee7aa	Sounds like all she really cares about is being in CONTROL of other people's lives & it undoubtedly makes her feel all too important when she does it.   What she needs to focus on is... to learn to control her own self.   Sometimes, it's necessary to deal with people who like being put up on a pedestal (self-important) this way>>> you may have to take drastic measures & break free from her by knocking her off of her pedestal thru politely "putting her down."   It may be the only way you'll get her off & keep her off your back.|`|48c3b53162e5b2c95fd0ecbe6cc71169aa	As hard as it is you must talk with her.  She obviously has no idea you feel this way, and probably will not get the clue anytime in the near future.  I'm sure she means well, most of us do while dishing out advice.  Just let her know that you appreciate what she has to say, but that you have a different opinion.|`|AA10687552	From your description, it sounds like she admires you on a very high level. I've seen these type of girls who don't leave people alone. I discovered that they look up to people like that. She probably thinks your a really cool person and she is trying to look out for you when your talking to or thinking about guys. Just tell her that you don't want her following you around as much and ask her why she follows you. All in all, you'll have your answer.|`|AA10663257	Well this is a tough one.  I would say legally you can go to the police and get a restraining order put out against her.  Thats the best thing I can think of.  I know you don't want to go there but desperate times calls for desperate measures.|`|AA11878749	Just avoid this person, be too busy, have other plans, and don't reveal what they are.  If she asked, just don't answer,   she:"hi, what's up, where are you going?'  you: gee, I'd like to talk but I'll be late."  she "Hey, can I go".  you."Gotta go, talk to you later" (click)    She'll get the idea after awhile

Two wrongs don't make a right!|`|d42558318b1f4f82df12db7fb3f019ceaa	I have went back and slept with her boyfriend who she knew I was first attracted to before they got together.|`|AA11614812	She started talking about my daughter, which is a line u just dont cross, and i went around town telling everyone that she was never raped ( which i doubt highly and know since she was such a sl\/t)  that she consented in letting them double team her and thats how she got gonorrhea.  Nasty Whore she should have never talked about my kid
89f4e13cef6589c8d1519ada61255b68aa	Every body is different. Hormones changes. Mood changes. I guess there's really no definate answer to your question.

Try having sex 3 or 4 times a week whether you "feel like it" or not. You need some callusses but first you have to get saddle sore.|`|AA11169686	Can your husband really deal with that? I mean are you a sex finatic or you just don't feel like doing it sometimes? I think you need to check with your doctor to find out if you have low levels of estrogen or something. It's one thing when your husband really wants it and you don't feel like giving him any, but you have to please his needs remember that. maybe you need some pills. That is if you like having sex altogether
21dc159b2df920b4159a2f1e641c9a58aa	Not every guy will like you, not everyone can like one person (unless you're TJ Detweiller)... If he doesn't want to talk, you can't force him. If you must, try taking him to a movie, or calling him. You have to instigate it, since he seems to not want to...

So what to do, I think she should go and talk to her boyfriend before getting pissed and ask him who she was. Then if it is a female that trying to hook up, would mean time to take action and kick both of there butts.

The fact that she did not do this indicates that she is either aware of what he has been doing or that he intimidates her.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	I would definetly talk to a lawyer before you get into a contract. But I think that if you are joint owners then you both own the house just not him.  Same goes for a business, just because business partners are not married doesn't mean that they both aren't entitled to the business    Hope this helps~|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	If your name is on ANY contract you are entiteld to half.  If your name is on the house and you have a child and you split up you can take him to court and have him removed from the contract, keep in mind that YOU will be responsible for the house payments though...or you can have him BUY you out of your half of the house.  He obviously knows nothing about contractual law...which can work in your favor later on.|`|e21c4f8cbf82990cfe523838ebd4e857aa	You should see a lawyer. You should see one BEFORE you buy  a house. He doesn't sound like much of a man, either.|`|2683787168ff562a1d7c6b8adbf37306aa	It depends on where you live and on their laws governing community property.  I know that here in TX that if two people are both on the house contract, then each person in responsible for the payments and if the couple breaks up, each person is entitled to half of the house or the proceeds from selling the house.  For more acurate information, you would need to find out how your state sees community property and what requirements there are for being protected under the law.|`|ca41405e242f8756d7e4da24b2ca7a3baa	If you both are on the title as Joint owners.

01f122afdb817a162becfc8c6afb53dbaa	Let's hope you are underage as well, if not well I don't want to think about it.  If she was older I'd say she likes you as a friend, and likes to keep you dangling because you do things for her.  The only way to really know if someone likes you in that special way is to do the lean in or ask to kiss her.  You sit close and lean over and kiss her, or you just ask her.  If she says no, or tells you she's not ready then she doesn't like you that way.  If lets you kiss her then she likes you. If she kisses you back thank your luck stars.|`|bc3bfab1763d1b4104ae01f205efb70faa	YOUR TEENAGERS BABY YOU AINT GOT NOTHING TO LOOSE.

AA12218889	I'm an attorney, so I'll try to give you an intelligent answer, unlike some of these others. From what you've stated it seems that your being placed into her will as a beneficiary, or other things.     Its mainly used to help identify people after your mother has passed away. If its bothering you go speak to her about it.|`|AA11545320	ive never heard of anyone needing someones social security number for a will.   go ask a lawyer and find out for sure before you give it to her, she maybe just want it to screw over your credit. i hope not.|`|AA11939205	could be, or it could be for tax reasons. why don't you ask her?|`|AA11643670	Your mom went to Social Services to apply for your Social Security Number.  Plus, she has paperwork from when you were young, she has your  , ......somewhere.  I've never heard of anyone needing it for a will. either.  But, give it to her cuz she can always find out somehow.|`|37a703cf299c93ca32e08cec257cbad7aa	As sad as it is there are some people out there that will say that they are someone else so they can get there money or items. In a will just as for listing beneficiaries in insurance policies it is better to be as specific as possible so there is no confusion as to who the person is. Such as listing names and ss 's for the purpose of identification rather than saying my kids. By listing names and ss 's it is specific enough so that if there is more than 1 child or if certain items are to specific people the right people will get them. "I leave Jane Doe (maiden name) xxx-xx-xxxx my entire stamp collection" rather than "I leave my daughter my stamps"|`|AA12287228	tax papers, but if shes your mother she should know your social security number, i know my daughters.

af9dda9a23f7707d9163b06bc981be2faa	A few years ago, I was faced with the same situation.  I made a little coupon book for my dad, sort of like the ones that the Lions Club sells.  Each coupon had a different favor on it, such as doing the dishes for him or giving him a bear hug.  Just decorate the coupons, make a cover for them, and staple it all together.  It's a sweet way to say "I love you" and "Happy birthday."  Also, make him breakfast in the morning.  Dads love that.|`|b52092ef0bdb4a50a92fca03dd3d77aeaa	My daughter recently lost her job and financially she can't afford to do the "buy a gift" option. Her dads is on the 5th! Her solution was to give him a a home made certificate good for mowing the lawn and weed eating. It may sound goofy or a trivial gift but to be honest it is something he dreads doing. If he had the chance to skip it he would. He will appreciate it more so I feel than another tie, dinner out, or a gift he can't use.

Lots who prey on girls your age.  If you enjoy talking to this man leave it at that.  You are too young to pursue anything else with him.  Especially if he's really 27.  He's way too old for you at this point in your life.  And even though you feel like you trust and love him, it's just too risky.  Too many crazy things happen through the net.  Be careful and keep yourself safe. . . .|`|311112b83d5a3836526fa6df56216c23aa	Ok honey,now listen, I am 26 and I have had that little feeling of needing that person on the chat.It is true you need them and you make up your whole life story very romantic and full of outgoings and freedom but we all do that.  He might have done the same.  I encourage you to excuse yourself and let him know that you are only 16, that you made mostly everything up and that you would like to keep his friendship.  If this person does not chat with you anymore is probably not because he was in love and now he is mad but it could be because he was only trying to find himself someone to spend time with and do much stuff together while he could be happily married and really you don't want to be heartbroken ant you are to young to experience stuff that is not yours to live yet.  He is your friend if he understands and emails with friendship only and you talk your problems and experiences over.You look like a smart yourg lady you'll know if he ok or you will need to cut him off.  Never give him your real name address or anything.  Don't even give him a picture sweetie this can be dangerous.  Not everyone is bad or sick but you don't want to be the one to find out.  Take care|`|8df31103c1cfe8f39116ff004a201f5faa	Age doesn't matter in love, but if u tell him truth thn, it is possible tht he reject u, and if he is 27 yrs old thn there is much chance that he hav some1 in his life.  ( So i think u should tell him whole truth, if ur love is true for him, i m sure tht he will accept u wid u truth. )     And tell as soon as possible, coz if u dont tell him ur truth thn u will b in depression and if its get late thn its possible he feel bad that u didn't tell him truth on time.
fa8fd0934c6fe34c260e84d96534f262aa	If you're asking whether lying is an effective dating tool, I would say that it might work for a short time but most lies are eventually discovered and so it is not a good way to start a relationship.  If you are being yourself, you never have to worry about being "found out" and you'll know that the person is with you because they like you for who you are and not who you would pretend to be.

For example if I am working, and you are bringing me my favourite beverage and food, massaging my back, maybe kissing a bit, but not stopping me, or saying anything about how much you want me to pay attention to you, I am much more likely to actually do it then if I am either being forced to do it or if you just show up naked(that is that method can wear thin quickly if it is used too much).

So I am telling you what you want to hear. GO FOR IT!!!! You only live once. If you are 100% sure that you aren't at risk of running into this friend of a friend's parents again, do it. Just be careful because you don't want to get a bad rap with parents (you didn't mention how old you were) because they do talk. And you could end up being that bad seed, the girl no one wants their children hanging out with. But if you and your friends are older and that is not really a big deal to you.

AA11566001	All I know is that Daniel Radcliffe is pretty darn gorgeous. He's also so funny! On every interview he has something to say about, well, everything and definitely shows his co-star Rupert Grint up...he makes Rupert look like a pretty boring person (if you have the "Goblet of Fire" DVD, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about~). On TRL, Vanessa asked him who he'd rather have a beef with: Malfoy or 50 Cent, and Daniel was like, "You mean like a steak?" Oh, I love that boy :)     DIRECT ANSWER: Daniel Radcliffe's personality definitely makes him hotter in my eyes :)    ~Have a great day~|`|AA11563426	Daniel Radcliffe|`|AA11765574	Daniel Radcliffe|`|AA11940652	true who r they?|`|AA10953000	Alan Rickman.|`|AA10626302	tie  totally|`|AA11665488	Who are they?|`|a53282a1860a0e9986864b7a9dde98d3aa	Hagrid is pretty damn sexy!|`|AA11446903	Rupert Grint is much hotter because he is a red head and red heads are hott with british accents.
AA10843092	You should let it go. You sound very young and alot happens in a teens or pre teens life that can change them forever. Why do you want to taint your friendship with a one time friend because she is going through things?     My advice: You are still hurt and confused about what's wrong with your friend. She locked you out of her life and you hate not knowing if she is hurt or not. Hopefully she will pull through this rough patch in her life but if she doesn't she will be missing out on your friendship which is revenge enough.|`|AA11789493	No, I wouldn't even if I could.  You have to stop these immature thoughts and activities and do something useful with your life.  People come and go in our lives, it's just the way it is.  Enjoy the pleasant memories and forget the rest.  Thoughts of revenge, getting even, punishing only eventually hurt yourself.|`|AA10953000	If you were looking to get revenge on an ex-boyfriend who did you wrong, I would help and encourage you, but that shite right there is just too petty for words. Find some new friends and get over it already.|`|b6395880901e0a1bbfd54eb0cc51f024aa	Revenge isn't the answer. You may be mad but why sink to her level? Just move on and find another friend. Life will go on, and you'll be alright. You shouldn't sneaking onto other people's internet.|`|AA11615156	u're crazy...get on with life...|`|AA11688662	now i see why she blew u off, u are nuts
AA11809895	well, I'm going through the same thing except i didn't have a baby recently... it seemed like all of a sudden he got extra stamina.... i thought maybe he was cheating but it was the fact that I'm turning him on more lately.... i started out complaining but now i feel like i need to keep him satisfied before someone else does... i would explain to him that you need time to heal completely and that your body needs rest and that you will make it up to him in time...|`|AA10423251	Sex? just after a baby? i think u should tell  him that ur energies are sapped tending to the baby. Unless he shares all ur work at home... then i think its not a bad idea to rock everyday. But then a bit of rest is ofcourse needed.   Talk this problem with him. If he loves u, he will understand and will take it easy,|`|AA10274492	That's kind of selfish of him. Tell him he has a hand.|`|AA10972524	He may be a little over - zealous; but, if he really loves you, he'll understand. You obviously have to be more important to him than sex. Alot of young guys who are just married, and still kind of immature have this problem. Over time, he should learn from you, that there is alot of difference between sex just to satisfy him, and great sex that you BOTH can enjoy. I would much rather have great sex.|`|AA10293210	What does just having had a baby have to do with anything? Sex doesn't always have to mean penetration and I always thought women were good to go within weeks after having a child?

Explain to him that you just had a baby and that you and your body still need time to adjust and recuperate.  Let him know you enjoy sex with him and want it - but that you need to cut back from once a day to maybe once every other day.|`|86214dadbf5592336075adb731e4d3b0aa	Good question!   Very hard to answer!  Try discussing it with  him, let him know exactly how you are feeling.  Best to you on this one.|`|AA12339836	Tell him.You just gave birth to his child.Let him know that it;s not him.It's just the fact that you are tired and worn out from the pressures associated with having a newborn.Maybe instead you could just do other things.Ex.cuddle, talk, oral, or if other things that you may enjoy that wouldn't require that much energy or time.|`|AA11358125	tell him u just had a baby give u time to heal|`|AA11373085	it's really hard, mine is the same way, I feel bad for him, but what can you do?  If you can't have sex, and he doesn't want anyone else, well he just has to wait and be understanding.  Buy him some porn, masturbate with him,(they love it, and it's low key) be sympathetic.  Good luck!|`|AA12325482	your baby is 3 months old ( yes, ive read other question you asked) so your body should be back to normal, so its not a very good excuse. maybe you just don't like/ feel like sex at present, alot of women lose their sexual libido for a while after having had a child. don't keep saying to him " i can't, the baby, im not up to it yet" or he'll start to resent the child.  theres plenty of other ways to satisfy a man without sex *wink*. you have hands and a mouth, and a bit of imagination goes a long way. trust me, ive had 2 kids, and am due the 3rd in 11 weeks, alot of the time i don't feel like sex either, but ive found other ways of making him happy.|`|AA12326409	Nom harm having sex with him daily.

But the good they die young. He passed away 7 years 3 months and 20 days ago. There are some men out there that really do care but they are hard to find or already taken.
AA11555370	It comes from a fear of the same thing happening. The best way to alleviate that fear is to make sure you are being trustworthy. There might always be that "feeling in the back of her mind," because she really loves you, and it would crush her if it did happen. But show her that you are not her previous husband. If you already romance her up, then good. If not, then start. Make her feel like she is the most sublime creature that walks the Earth. Let her know that she is your Queen and you are her King, and there is NO other woman for you but her. Trust me, it's nice when a woman hears the words. You have to embed it in her mind. And keep it that way. Don't let the hard work fly out of the window.    Good luck to you.|`|AA11784668	yeah, in your case, that's your woman's way of saying, YOU NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ME and/or I DO NOT FEEL SAFE and/ or LOVED.    ask her what she would like you to do to assure her.  make sure she writes it down for you.  AND THEN DO MOST OF IT!    if you don't want to do that, here are some tried and true behaviors that works:     - call her just to say "hi, i'm thinking about you" and "i love you".  if she has a tendency to keep you on the phone longer than you want, tell her in advance "i'm in the middle of something, but i've been thinking about you all day.  i love you, honey."    - hold the door open for her and have her go through it first    - hold her hand    - cuddle with her in the morning    - cuddle with her at night     - when you get up to get something, ask if you can get her anything    - when you kiss her good-bye, give her more than a quick peck on the cheek.  a look in the eye and a "i've gotta go, baby" and a kiss on the lips, followed up with a "i'll see you tonight" gets a woman all happy inside.      - write her a quick note and put it where she's bound to see it. if just you guys share a bathroom, put it right on the mirror.  it can just be a sticky with "I ? U" and your name signed.  Yes.  it's THAT SIMPLE.    - just stare at her until she notices, (she'll probably ask what's wrong) then smile and say "I love you."    - when she's doing something (like washing the dishes), ask "can i help you with that?"  ask even if you know she is more than capable of doing it herself.  trust me on this one.  just you asking will make her all gooey inside.      - take her car and get it cleaned and/or fill it up with gas.    - for no reason, take her aside, give her a hug, a kiss, a say, "I love you."      good luck!  your wife is very fortunate to have a loyal and caring husband.|`|AA11220522	Well.....did you ask her if she was cheatin'?  Yike! yike! the guilty dog........|`|AA11939205	sounds like your both heading for having 3 ex partners...get some counseling asap, or pack your bags...sorry.|`|9fe1ae279e50b5caea7e4279fb522228aa	I would have seriosuly said this to her face"of all people i should be the one with the feeling inside"please i think you need to ask her if she is cheating because heres what i think maybe she wants to think your cheating so she feels less guilty about cheating on you before or...maybe shes cheating on you again and looking to even the scores even though you have been faithful do someting to prove to her she is you love and no one else would ever compare not even your first wife|`|37d5fe873ed1b5d0076d34fc22704df0aa	Oh my sweetie!!  She is so hurt, and its not your fault... This is something that she has brought with her from the other marriages, and you are paying the price..... You need to talk to her, and tell her that you are not them... And coming into this marriage with you, to trust until she has a reason not to..... You could be the true love for her, and she is missing it, cause of the blindness of the past.......... She is afraid to give her heart cause of bridges burnt....... Tell her we only have one life to live, and please trust you, cause its your life to..... Do you want to spend the rest of your life being accused of something your not doing?  Good luck
AA12167219	We think about it because they aren't around anymore.  As long as someone is living it's in the back of our mind that we can call them, write them, go and see them - even if we never do.  When someone dies it registers in our head that they aren't there anymore and there is no way we can get to know them or let them know we actually cared about them - which brings on a little guilt, because no matter how busy you are it only takes 5min of your time to call a loved one and say "hi, how are you" and let them know you care.  In our society family isn't always the most important thing and it should be.  In other cultures family is everything, no matter what.  Here in America other things become important - friends, ourselves, work, etc - and we just don't give our family the time that they deserve.|`|eac567cd596099d06ef876bf1c2fa46baa	because there dead. gone. you will never see them again.|`|AA11635058	It's because death naturally makes people think of things they could have done.|`|AA11781916	Because we take life for granted - we never think that someone is going to die - we just assume they will be here forever - until they finally do pass away - then all of a sudden - things start running through our mind of what we could have changed - said - or done better - unfortunately at this point it's to late - I guess that's why we have to stop taking people for granted - and realize that everyone will die at somepoint - make sure we say how we feel - tell them we love them - and get to know them as a true person|`|AA11847144	Because that person is no longer there so you can't say I'll get to know them tomorrow because now there is no tomorrow for them and you know that death is finally that's why you should never put off what you can do today for tomorrow live life for today that way you would never have to look back and say I could have or should have done that

If he is normal....then start talking about relationships...and marriage...and that you want kids before you finish school because you want to stop working. Then start asking him to buy you things...better yet, insist that he buy everything. If he continues to be crazy about  you...then consider the first comment and see below:    If he is obsessed, then you need to nip it in the bud. Be direct and clear. Tell him it is over that you aren't interested. If that seems really harsh...try the "other boyfriend" scenario. Say you have a long time crush that is just taking over your mind. Say that you could never hurt him by pretending to like him when someone else has your heart.     If that doesn't work...revert to the direct path. Say that it is not mutual. That you do not want contact....that you do not want calls or other communication. If it requires more than that...mention legal intervention to prevent further problems.    I mention these options not because you need them...but because it is always good to know. Why as this information if you had just a normal guy pursuing you? It is easy to lose a guy usually just by talkinga about other guys...and flirting and ignoring the one that is interested.     Best solution is to always be direct. Try it first...otherwise...resort to my recommendations.

AA10628572	Don't listen to your friends.  Enjoy the secret love affair, life's too short not to...though it doesn't sound so secret if your friends know.  Since you work in different departments it's no big deal.  If you worked in the same office on the same floor then it might be a big deal.  If you really care for this woman and she cares for you then shut out the negative remarks that others make about it.  It's no ones business but your own.  You have to remember, YOU ARE BOTH ADULTS....repeat....BOTH ADULTS.  Hopefully everything will work out.  If it doesn't then you have to remember you are both adults and will handle it in a professional manner.  You're not little children (Hello.)      Your friends are jealous....YES, they are...and PETTY also.  Shame on them!  They should be happy for you.  It's really sad they had to come down on you like that.      Also, I know of lots of couples that met through work and fell madly in love, got married and are still married to this day.  It's wonderful.  Please don't listen to your so called friends....who I wouldn't call friends at all.  Also, you should not have made it any of their business in the first place.  And shame on you for that part!    One additional note:  Since you are already having the affair this is a senseless question to ask at this stage.  You should have asked it before you started the affair.  What difference will it make now.  Therefore, you might as well enjoy it.|`|AA11514977	It always causes a potential problem|`|AA11534512	I married my husband last year and we work for the same company, but different depts.

If either of you are married I would suggest stopping everything ASAP. If not, and if you both love each other I don't see anything wrong with dating one another...just promise each other that things won't get nasty if you run into a bump or breakup! See, dating at work is a bad thing, especially if you work together because if you two are having "issues" then you're bringing them to work - a place where you should be able to escape each other!|`|b97b76ad2f3eeeec41dbcc27ecb8b606aa	A buddy of mine married a girl in his department but later got divorced from her.  Thankfully she left the company.    On the other hand there are another 2 that work in the same capacity and they seem happy.  It's a coin toss but it can get really awkward if the relationship goes south.  With office politics it can be very tricky even if you guys stay together.    If shes really great then I say go for it.|`|AA12282153	Haven't you ever heard the old saying, "don't screw around where you work, and don't work around where you screw" !!!|`|ef6529feec1ff0cdc90b5eb9704710b5aa	no|`|AA11004540	Jay J got Lay laid!!|`|6faa125514bca0d8a54a08321a9e4448aa	i am in an office relationship right now there are some difficulties especially when you have to keep it a secret. but i think if the person really likes you it will definitely work out.|`|AA12289833	I would say don't do it!!!|`|AA10252127	Personally,the answer is no.  My reasoning is because if the relationship goes sour and you hold a higher ranking in the company than she does, and she turns out to be a vindictive, scorned lover (which isn't really far fetched when you think about it) she legally has the power to rake you over the coals.
AA10982839	I'm hot....it's 95 degrees here but my car temp said 105 when I got in it earlier.|`|AA10552319	ditto, this heat is intense.|`|4a19fb361a1fabcc07e4f7fcea4cd818aa	i'm hot    thanks for the two points|`|6ba7640c3f275363965168c7ad2893f8aa	she is hot|`|AA11895171	actually is pretty cool here
AA11355851	Do you care about the girl or your friends? How come they all get to have g/f's but you don't? call her, ask he to hang out with you and see were that takes you. Let her know that there may be other guys interested in her but you want first bids and see what she does. If you start dating see her alone a couple of times until you are ready to hang out with your friends as a couple.|`|778b81e1a29d5b4fd46adf73ac8c253daa	Your answer depends on you yourself.
85780f7f13406e144707be86fa2db58baa	Well, something has changed. I was in a crazy horrible relationship for way too long, let me help you out. First, have you tried talking to him about this?  Regardless....No one and I mean no one has the right to make you feel second class. No matter how long you have been together. It is sad and scarey when things start going down hill after years together but just because you have invested time is no reason to stay and find out if he is really going to hit you. Love doesn't behave this way. My guess is that he is doing something wrong and all that hiding is making him guilty and he is projecting that onto you. It is a pretty standard jackass tactic. You are better than that.....I wish you the best in making a decision that is safe and fulfilling for you. We only get one life.|`|AA11452550	maybe you should hit him with a stick and then vigorously laugh at his face as he looks at you perplexedly.. then when he'll ask you why you did that: kinda like a ' Whyd u do that to me, *****?' or black things like that.. you will say back unto him;    'Well, you been actin' kinda weird laytly so i though id hit you for no reason just like you act weird for no ABSOLUTE ******* reason...     at that moment he'll go crazy and dump you immediately cuz of course hell think you TWO KINDSA CRAZY OR SOMM'N then you will weep bitterly because of his loss and genuinly COMMIT SUICIDE, for no reason|`|bab14f25e7446637f83bec2e8da1fbe7aa	That's your cue get out of the relationship this is the kind of stuff that Maury and Jerry Springer end up having to deal with.

But i dont know, something sounds funny to me, i think hes hiding something, he could be involved with something illegal you never know. Just give him his space, and stay away for a while, because you never know.|`|AA11616906	cut him|`|AA12274616	If you've been together for 2 years, you should be able to sit down and talk about it. Just tell him you need to know what's going on with him and if it concerns your relationship. If he says no, tell him how it's affecting you. If he says yes, ask him to explain it to you so you know how to deal with it. Communication is very important. If he won't talk to you at all, tell him you need to leave the relationship as you no longer feel safe. Good luck.|`|AA11607623	Sounds like he's undergoing a personality change. Do you think he may be doing drugs or alcohol? You need to find out what he is doing when he is not with you. If he is starting to get violent as hard as it may sound, you may have to end the relationship. First get the answers you need and make your decision from there.|`|AA11410342	Well....he doesn't love u anymore or he found someone else! :-??
AA11310429	you shouldn't do it he is playing you because he knows you still love him|`|58ccde768a3b133504fc322651b94e96aa	dont be stupid girl hes playing with you|`|AA12388363	LISTEN YOU SHOULD NEVER GO BACK TO EATING YOUR VOMITS, IF HE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS, THEN I THINK IT;S OKAY BUT DON'T ALLOW IT TO CROSS INTO THE OTHER AREA|`|461930e206725e96eac73c7f11ad0eaaaa	How in the name of all that's sacred can ANYBODY love someone for whom simple respect is impossible?

AA10982839	16 in many states but the child can hire an attorney provided possibly by the courts to see what is in the best interest of the child.|`|b375224924ee089ed0f8b02ae44e50aeaa	Just went thru that with my ex, he had our daughter and she wanted to live with me.  He wouldn't let her come to see me at all and barely let her cal me.  Then one weekend he gave in and let me have her. She begged not to go back and he tried to take her.  She was 12  and he called the law out there and they let me keep her cuz neither had gotten custody of her.  And as long as you haven't entered a custody agreement who ever has the child in their possession's and being they are over 11 in the state of Texas anyway. So if you have that right just check and see and do as I did.  The law is on your side.|`|AA12015130	Get an attorney and go to Court.  Nowadays Judges will listen to children around age 14.

70ed9c886f8bf93e3143325f880e2789aa	These days there is a huge misunderstanding about preps, that you are instantly a prep when you wear Abercrombie and start acting snobby and dumb. First of all, preps are those who attend prestigious preparatory schools in New England, and who comes from a very prominent family such as a high ranking politician or a person from the academia. Real preps are very smart and athletic. They don't wear trashy clothing brands like Abercrombie and hollilster (especially not hollister, because hollister relates to the surf scene and California). They wear Polo, Lacoste, and famous designer name clothes. Just be yourself. Then you'll see everyone equally, instead of the prejudice formed by these nonsense stereotypes.|`|108d8f13b5bd5ab3230dd74e8a46f79eaa	Back in my day a Prep was someone who went to Catholic school!|`|AA11109956	prep isn't supposed to be an insult... but is used as one.

Or are you really needed, and it's you with the problem.  There is alot you have to figure out.  I'm sure if you talk about it, then you two will figure it out together.

88e9a6d4aa2db137a4a8f06c2660c60baa	First, have confidence in yourself that you are the object of desire.  That doesn't mean to compare yourself to some sort of "sexy" standard you found in a magazine or in a rumor.  That means that there already is something about you that is very likable, kissable and uh-huh... that.    The best you can be is passionate, aware and into the moment.  Technical skill is only necessary in porn films, not real life or good relationships.    Most of all, have fun and know that it's been fun for as long as it's been around!|`|AA11277726	Make each time different. Try different things and always keep him wanting more.  The day he is satisfied fully is the day he starts looking for another mount.|`|AA10649406	he probaly already surprised enough that you loved him enough to have sex with him....|`|AA11924061	look up karma sutra it gives you many poses and positions you can try with your man
092d12d007f042a349e272631f3714eeaa	No. Sex is NOT overrated, but it must be done right!  And by that I mean that sex is a wonderful experience when all the ingredients are in place. Some of those things are being comfortable with your body and being sexual, mutual passion and desire to please each other, willingness to take the time to discover each other and what each other likes, and not expecting it to be fireworks the first time.  There is a lot to be gained by being with someone for awhile.  There is a trade off of course, but with a little imagination, you can always keep your love life fresh and exciting.   Don't give up!  And remember, if you don't have to wory about STD's or getting pregnant, it's also a better experience, so please take the necessary precautions.|`|AA10649406	yes...|`|AA12326796	Overrated? No, I don't think so. In a good relationship sex should have an important place. And be fun for both.    Just my opinion.|`|AA11826398	yes|`|AA11310429	yes!!! because when you really love someone it shouldn't be all about sex|`|0061d1c9345ece864e98ca4a3459fb66aa	uhn well i am 14 i had it for the first time with my bf for 6 months and it was great but as i dont know for your first time it is not the greatest but the seconded time we did it i loved it, it was every thing i ever imaged, i dont know why didnt happen on the first time, know i am gonna be honest and if i could take it back i would becuase im never gonna get my first time back i would of liked to keep it for a little bit longer so WAIT !!!!|`|AA11457582	so i hear|`|AA11927054	no.
AA10669675	there has to be reason for your family opposing to you guys seeing each other....they may know best.......maybe you guys have to prove yourselves to them(your families)....sweetie it may be a blessing.....I would say pray on it....if it is meant to be it will......|`|AA12007347	If it is true love, it will wait until the two of you turn your legal age (18, or 21, what ever your state says is legal). Then your parents will have nothing to say about it.|`|6819e758c144e3829cd57f174f912978aa	If no one knows you are together and you don't get to see each other, how does dating work?  Right now you might be feeling that this person is all you have ever wanted, but if you look at your future years I think you would want more.  For example, to be with someone and spend the years of your life with someone who could be included, accepted, and loved by your family.  After all, you have the rest of your life, your future children's lives and to have peace with your family is important.  That is true happiness.|`|AA12142700	It depends upon the reasons you can't see each other. If he's significantly older than you are, your parents could be concerned that he's taking advantage of you. Your parents might also feel that he's being physically, emotionally, or sexually harmful to you and they're hoping that if they don't allow you to see him anymore, then you'll meet someone else who treats you the right way. In that case, put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself how you would respond to one of your family members being in a relationship identical to yours. Talk to them about this and explain your point of view.    If it's a racism thing, sometimes it can be harder to help family to come around to your way of thinking. Family members have had their views their whole lives, and changing those views can take a LOT of time and effort. You might have to accept the fact that if you want to be with him, it could be years or it could be never that your family will accept him, and evaluate how you'd feel without family support in the relationship.    Essentially, it depends why you're apart now and why family opposes you being together. Then, it would be easier to advise you!|`|27328573db52352e230eb2fc85baf9a2aa	then go for it child follow your heart  not what your parents say u can be with who u want
6819e758c144e3829cd57f174f912978aa	Belle, I hope you read this.  I want you to contact him.  Even if it is just a friendly conversation... not to suggest starting a relationship again... just to talk... I regret not doing so with my first love, the love of my life.  I dated him all through high school.  He was my FIRST.... We left things unresolved when we broke up.  There were a few times we ran into each other, but not a word was spoken.  He died last year after battling a brain tumor for 6 years.      I had heard that he had a brain tumor and had called his mom when I found out.  She said he was in remission, but had surgery to remove the tumor.  I decided not to contact him because I knew he had gotten married and I didn't want to cause a problem.  I wanted him to be happy.  I was about to get married and went on with my life.  I didn't keep contact with his mother.    After 5 years my marriage fell apart and I left.  I thought about contacting him by mail to see how he was doing, but I didn't.  Three months after I left my marriage he died.  I found out by my mother telling me his obit was in the paper.  I went to the funeral, dressed in black.  Interesting enough, his own wife was not in black.  I went to see his mother.  I can still hear her voice telling me, "You should have been his wife."  I guess he did not have a good marriage.  In the 6 years of him fighting that tumor and the 4 surgeries he had, she went to the hospital twice.  Jeff had once told his mother it is a terrible thing to be married to someone who hates your mother and your twin brother.  He is an identical twin.      Had I known I would have been there for every hospital thing, every surgery... everything.  He died on a Wednesday, the friday before he died he came to me in a dream.  I did not know he was dying.  All he said was "I love you." then he disappeared.  The next week his obit was in the paper.  I was crushed... am still crushed a year and a half later and regret never resolving things when we had the chance.      The one saving grace is he now sees everything I have been through and knows why things went the way they did way back then.  I know he loves me, he knows I will always love him, and his mother and I keep in contact and see each other regularly.  We have helped each other cope with our grief have been the saving grace for one another through this terrible time.  Jeff was only 33 years old.    I pray that your love never faces something like this and you have the courage to speak to him and not leave things unresolved.  Please contact him, if not for you, then for me and in Jeff's memory... you can even tell him about this~ its the perfect reason.|`|5f56bb457aa53eb11fcb12df7b8de09aaa	I know how you feel, you obviously are either still feeling for him, or you ahve been so hurt in that relationship that you can't get over it. To be honest think about your feelings. If you feel the same about him, you need to confront him, if you know your only hurt by the past, you need to stay away and talk to someone|`|a4e4c8ef70fc1b77689e60573194d216aa	yeah been there done that. It is really hard to deal with your heart stopping like that.  If he has no feelings for you then you must let it go and move foward and just live life like you have been.  If this guy is still into you then you must say something.|`|5fa20baf9cd0f93c2920041a61bc5519aa	does he love you too? did he ever?  if yes then try to contact him and hang out with him, get to know him more.    is he into a relationship? did he never love you?  if yes then move on... it is a waste of time and feelings.   instead start looking at other guys who may have have feelings for you as well... there's nothing more romantic and beautiful than someone loving you back.|`|a8b1a9c83d1d0b3b5c531566f272283faa	Check out this song/// The song by Mariah Carey, "Don't Forget About Us!!!"   I know exactly how you feel. Everytime I hear this song, I think of him. You have to try to move on girl. Your feelings will be there cause you truly loved him but a person is not worth your time if he doesn't feel the same for you!!!|`|c04c5741427382a6b1b00479817db64caa	The fact is, you aren't over him which is why you felt that way . Don't be desperate, love yourself and know you are a special woman who deserves a special man who will show you through his actions, words and knows how to communicate his love for you with his heart. I can tell you, he's not the one for you and until you realize it you will keep yourself from welcoming the true love of your life the opportunity to touch your heart. Its never easy when one feels love towards another, but if the relationship was broken off you have to move on and believe that what you hold in your heart is waiting for you to say come into my life and I welcome you and share my unconditional love you only you.|`|AA12006919	It will never go away until you start loving a new person even stronger than you used to love him.

AA12291003	i have yahoo messenger with voice and really, i don't see any difference at all
AA12117213	Is the mother letting him call the other guy dad. Need more details.|`|27da0bfccbf4934f71f3ed69ef3db46aaa	Maybe if you spend more time (as much as possible) with him/her doing the "dad" things. Maybe even letting your child know how it makes you feel hearing him call another man dad. If your kid is old enough he might understand and maybe even stop calling him dad. If not, just feel comfort in knowing that other man can never actually really be his dad. (sorry if your kid is a girl, reference to one gender is much easier than saying him/her each time) I know this is not a lot of help for dealing but I hope it helps.|`|AA11549317	Deal with it.|`|75878f51bcb92e259682e91fe6ed96b4aa	i call me step father dad just to hurt my own father so some might feel hurt sad and maybe angered|`|35b426ef4a3e21311d48ca5b6ac491fcaa	Divorce is a trauma on a child, so don't take it out on him/her and don't blame them. It is your ex, that you need to talk to. Tell her how it makes you feel, calmly. If you get no where with her then just have a talk with the child and make an arrangement. He/she calls you Daddy and the other dude Dad. That is a compromise. That is the best that you are going to get. You have no control over it. Good luck.|`|AA11799143	you tell yr child "matt, this is not your daaady this is Patrick" kind of thing...|`|AA11637471	Try to look at it this way. The more people there are that love your child, the better off your child will be. Is this other man around your child more than you? If so, then it would be natural for the child to call him "Dad". Please do not talk to your child about it because all that will do is make him/her feel guilty and I'm sure you don't want that. Try and spend more time with your child if you can and always let him/her know you love them, no matter what.|`|AA10665836	Well it depends on the situation. If you are one of those fathers that dont give a darn it sure is. But since you are asking the question it kinda seems like you arent one of those men. You should sit your ex down and tell her how it bothers you and that you are the childs daddy. Be honest about it, dont lie about any of your feelings. If your child is old enough try talking to him/her. But remember it takes more of a man to be a daddy then it does just to father a child!|`|1569a3834a48f9267580974cd39b8396aa	i will just let him know that this is very bad manners to tell any other person your daddy.|`|AA12333866	u call ur child nephew|`|3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	what??? he is??? whos the dead muthaf*****|`|ecea6fa538c22163b5b7571363107db3aa	This may not be the answer you want but if this other guy loves your kid and does right by him I don't see the problem. A child can never have too much love so don't stress about it as long as you give your child as much love and attention as you can he will know you are  1 Dad in is life. When the child begins to go against your wishes and runs to the other guy when you say no, then you have a problem. Sit down with your ex and the other guy and tell them that no matter what the child calls him your rules still apply that your word and his mothers word is law.|`|a108d872992e3094b108069b8f1255feaa	Well i believe it depends if the child's real father is around or in their life still. My son goes to his dads all the time and knows that is his father, but he also calls my fiance daddy. He calls his real daddy just daddy and he calls my fiance daddy mark. So he knows the difference. I think if the real father is not around it would be ok only if the mother is serious with the guy.

AA11276475	Sweetie, you are suffereing from the "I am worthless" syndrome. Get over it NOW! You are the same person you always were, have the same merits and weaknesses, the same love for others locked inside. One bad relationship does not mean you will have another. IF what you want from a date is a quickie, go for it. IF you are looking for something more, wait until you have your ego and self-worth back together. We all have been there, but ... unfortunately, I have found that being asked to go to bed is NOT a compliment, it is just what it is...the same guys who want to bed you down will go down a line to the first who says "yes." It is amusing to watch it in bars...Try watching and laughing. You will get a great sense of perspective. The best of luck to you...nothing in you has changed.|`|AA11112028	Quit telling everyone about it and dwelling on it.  You don't need to "get over it" and you don't need to go to therapy.  My God you had a bad date.  So have millions of other people.  That's the point of dating - to determine if you are compatible or not.|`|a53b8c7830cfe71ec140fe79031a1563aa	That's one of the basic differences I've seen between guys and girls. Guys just move on to the next one and forget about the last one.|`|AA11939205	don't let the first date after a divorce get you down, just chalk it up to a learning experience and move on! i'm sure your not desperate, just out of practice...i'm doing the same, but mine is from a death. its a learning experience all over again.|`|AA12200211	bounce back and do things your way for a while|`|AA11096766	Have a night out with your girls!|`|f6f7edac78adee69ddf65497f061ceb5aa	Get drunk|`|c78c9df083449278a7c96ce04ed06db3aa	Just make one day for you.

Bring friends to.|`|0b0e40b6985bdbb1a63e3338e93b641daa	Get another date.|`|AA11728346	Brush it off!! And don't keep thinking about it, doing so might make you hesitant toward going on more dates. Yeah sure you'll get some losers, we all have (I've had tons :) . All it takes is a couple dates with a good guy to change your feelings and boost your self-esteem. After being separated myself I wanted to go out to see what the world has to offer after being out of the dating game for 10yrs myself. At first I thought I wasn't going to find someone as good as my ex, and every guy I looked at wasn't my type, was too short, or too tall etc and so on. I felt sorry for myself, thought I could just be single forever! And I recently met someone that is truly a good guy and has made me feel that dating again isn't going to be as bad as I thought. Hang in there, and don't get discouraged!
AA11939205	stop hinting, just ask her if she would be willing to be with another man while you watched! if she gets offended, play it off like you were joking, if she is open to it, you have your answer!|`|AA11134384	Watch a porn 3-some together and pop the question|`|AA12377184	You should just invite me over, I'll handle it for you !!!|`|AA12251888	What you should do is first talk about both your sexuall fantacys, then just easily lead to that pointe.|`|AA10090566	Don't push her because she will feel that you are not really interested in her anymore and just want her to hook up with somebody else.Before even suggesting something like that just ask her to fantasies about another man ,tell you stories how she goes to another man every time she leaves the house(even get a picture of another dude).I guess that's the safest but  if you really go on with this idea you should expect a lot of trouble.I never heard of strong enough couples to go through that and stay together.  Enjoy :)|`|AA10283733	Have a male friend flirt with her and see how she reacts. If she seems interested suggest to her that she wear something revealing the next time he is over and proceed from there, a little more each time|`|AA11455007	Don't go there.  The fantasy may turn you on, but that is Satan messing with your head, because when you actually see some other man pleasuring your wife, you are bound to get jealous.  For all you know that other man could be better at sex than you and your wife could fall in love with him or get addicted to his sex and forget all about you.  So be careful what you wish for, you just might get it!

It doesnt' matter how old or young you are -- when you are moving around, exerting energy, having fun and feeling passion in what you are doing, that is the best medicine to happiness!    Salsa dancing is my thing, and I totally feel the same way.  I think dancing releases and moves energy around me, makes me motivated and enthusiastic about life, and is actually healthy too! Imagine that, having fun and being healthy at the same time.

2253307a6cde390091d89f22e97b600daa	Friend, there are many ones.  You will be drawn to the "right" ones but don't believe that one lost means the journey is over.     More simply, there are many people you could be compatible with as "the one true love" is a bit of a myth.  So you have nothing to lose, you will only grow for trying.  If he/she turns out to be a jerk, you can dump them then.     It is important to feel that you are whole, even without a partner, and to feel that you are ready to face your life by yourself.  When this happens you will magically find what you are looking for.     It's a strange paradox, the universe only gives us what we want when we give up our attachment to wanting it, or at least that's how it worked for me.|`|726b7978dcff06ce10b75559cfd8254eaa	when you care about someone else more than you care about yourself and they care more for you than themselves when you want the other person to be happy no matter what even if it is without you thats the real deal

f541a3b493c4d41a74aebea611dd5f85aa	I think it's more socially acceptable for a black man to be with a white woman even though interracial relationships are still somewhat frowned upon. As long as people are happy why should anyone care.|`|AA11429639	Where I live it's just the opposite.|`|AA12111208	I don't know how true this is, but I have read it , it's not a racial slur either. but what I have heard is that if there is a difference of 30 points or more in IQ level, people can't communicate and most African American males have about the same IQ as white females where their white male counterparts have a much higher IQ average. and if you look around, the African American females that end up with white partners on the average have a much higher IQ than the average African American male. so it may appear to be a communications thing. I didn't make this up but read it somewheres.|`|AA12365491	People are people so why should it be????|`|AA11916597	Not really sure, but as long as there happy who cares...|`|db6871243d2721d03671b175e2410aa9aa	Who cares??? If they are in love - skin color doesn't really matter.

What a racist thing to say!|`|AA11625510	Because white men have better taste. I bet it has to do with the fact that white women don't know how to say no.|`|11651177ca71d792dbb8cd35f2fe545aaa	Dont know why, there are some very beautiful black women out there.|`|613266b58d2a5608c0da05fb57528669aa	Because a black man will take a white woman because she will be more submissive than a black woman on the other hand it is my opinion that white men may be some what intimidated by black women.|`|ce215a7efcc72b2ee1d1b55d2d885b56aa	Because white men can't handle black women. who knows. good question by the way. never thought about it. I think we should ask the african American ladies here. :)|`|AA12308496	Just guessing here but men are more physical minded and driven and therefore at times are more superficial than women who know that emotions and mental aspects of a relationship is just as important.  Men therefore can be uncomfortable with differences and often worry more about what others might think and their bias is therefore more revealed.      I agree that there are several very beautiful black women, Asian women and women of all races and nationalities.  I am white and would have no problem dating a black women at all.  I've met many black women whose personality also is as lovely as they are.      It also could be that men are more biased than women, as a factor of their makeup and therefore put a mental barrier in their mind that the will not even consider the beauty in another race or people other than their own.  Just some ideas and thoughts but you are right, at least for most of the places I have lived or visited.|`|00db3c66d762b84894228644dca1f632aa	I see more white women with black men, than black women with white men.

And>>> they gots all tha monies.|`|274b7e8d51d2bca061ca9620e99bc348aa	Well I am a black woman who only date white men and I think it's because black women are raised to not go outside their race(that's how my fam raised me). When a black women dates a white man she is then considered in the black community a slut or a whore. My family hates the fact that my bf is white. We are suppose to sit around a wait for a "strong black man" to be interested in us.  I think it's bull I say date whomever you wish. And that is exactly what I do.  I'm a lot like time, I wait for no one. I'm too cute for that bs.|`|AA12146314	why do you notice skin color?

Sounds unreal, but I believe it.|`|a13806e50b14db4f4a222ec190057cfcaa	OK, I got to the reason from a guy  I worked with named Bo .  Now Bo was the neatest guy and we had alot of fun at the placed where we worked. I think it was right after thr O.J. trial. We were just talking and he asked ,me do you want to know why you see more black guys with white girls than the other way around ? I said sure . This is what  he told me.... Now this is what a black told me. He said white girls put with more crap out of their guys than black women do. He said he had no problem with getting them to give him money from them that they just took better care of him . Now one one get made at me I am just telling you what I was told.|`|61d76b85c1bbd38410f109a584ab3e4daa	I don't know whatt some of these people are talking about but coming from someone wha has dated all spectrum's of the rainbow, it has to do with how someone treats you regardless of the color. If you go out looking for "white women then you may have problems" but if you just happen to find it then what's the big deal? the media sensationalizes interracial relationships and people who are either jealous(because they don't have a man or messed up their relationship) are prejudiced, or just stupid just eat it up. Why? worry about who you are with and who is making you happy. From 1st hand experience SOME (a small percentage not all)black women have a bad habit of putting a black man down when he is already down. But that happens in all races too. Some black men have gotten tired of it and have sworn off black women all together and that's wrong in itself.

37f54a350e8577a779d6fd7fa5fe9406aa	Whoa Girl... Way to many abbrvs. Think I got the idea though.  Here's the thing. You need to ask yourself "Is he worth the heartache and stress you are going through"?  Did he leave another friend of yours to be with you?  He will repeat the same pattern.  Is he willing to share his thoughts with you regarding hopes and dreams he may have and does he listen to your thoughts as well?   I am also a huge flirt, BUT I always and truly am respectful and use this trait as grounds for women to help themselves feel better about themselves not to play games. My heart is true and I am sincere. My date knows 100% that she will be the one that I will be with as when the evening is over. I project this.  Okay enough rambling, 'nother question you should find out. Is he on good terms with his past lady friends? If not, this is a big red flag about being with him.  For some reason I have found that all best friends seem to want each others... other friends other...Hope that made sense. It comes from the need for confiding in friends opinions about what your present situation is and why you are happy. You confide... and then they want this same happiness. They won't speak it outloud but in their subconcious thoughts a plan starts forming. Then events start happening to fulfill these desires to be as happy as you. It usually happens first with the persons significant other.   Its the thought processes that doom us. Yes I have been on both sides of situation, but I have learned from it. Whatever is on our mind most is what is drawn to us. A simple example would be: I better not hit all the damn stoplights through town again or I'll be pissed!!!! Better to think: I seem to always get through town fast and with little difficulty. Or how about, whenever you are in a hurry, it seems someone is there to slow you down. Like a guy in a grocery line that has the strangest problems that hold progress up or the driver in front of you that seem to KNOW that you are in a hurry and makes every turn you are going to make but he is driving half the speed that you want to be driving.   Or in your case.  I am so worried that my friend is going to steal my bf away from me. Constant worry or negitive thoughts bring doom to you girl. The ironic part could be that she may have never wanted your present bf in the first place, but due to your negative thought processes events are happening to bring doom on to you.  Think possitive, starting with self help books and getting around people that are possitive.  Hugs and smiles to you,  Jeff|`|28dc92224264528445a0cad0b25c709faa	Ask him how he feels but be alone!|`|545d68022d47eb53549412d63a90f088aa	well he is YOUR bf so y wuld u just break up wit him. ur bff is no friend at all. if u think u love him then y wuld u just break up with him? if he liked her wuldnt he just break up wit u??|`|fa3d0a5a96c9fd6c37f17cf7e1fb7381aa	I have no idea what you are trying to say|`|AA11404113	You could call the Jerry Springer show and duke it out in front of an audience!|`|4e691eae4a89fdd034de86f002cb5c61aa	If you see them flirting do NOT ignore it.

ea0c0b2ee1d6ac591c368a39ad677b76aa	THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION,,    i have always been told that persons who criticize, and put people down need  to build themselves up, and they feel superior by doing this act,     when some people criticize, it is that the see a similar fault, or "defect" THAT they have in themselves,,      the same way when a person accuses you or someone of lying, cheating stealing or something,, is because they would be projecting what they would do in that situation,,        criticism, can be kind, or cruel, constructive criticism, (i always hated that expression ) BECAUSE IT IS SAID LIKE IT WAS A GIFT AND IT STILLL HURT.    Sometimes some people are just being honest and if the person is sensitve they take it as criticism,,    If someone shows me a better way of doing something, (a job, planting  flowers,or handling something i am not experienced in,, it may not be criticism, but if they embarrace me, of i feel like they are putting me down, then i will think they are critical, when maybe, they had a valid point,    so to sum it up as i type this, i guess my opinion is in the delivery,, if you speak kindly, and in an appropriate manor, it would not be criticism, it is all in delivery,,...  ps please don't criticise my answer, it is meant kindly,,|`|b621faedf42d72a5c7ed54b94d7879e0aa	Some people think they are always right, no matter what.|`|5b5af5996541cb6415e25d42b3bce9d0aa	some people can take it because they are confident in themselves. other's just give critism because it gives them confidence and makes feel good about themselves by trying to break other people's confidence down.|`|ee13f84807fea2be64ff443d915d4d6aaa	Hey?

Sex is not that important unless your a teenager that has never had it.|`|AA10373737	Everyone here has already in so many words said to be patient so I'm not going to say that.  I want to make you look at things form her eyesight.  If the two of you have a lot in common and you know how she feels about you and you about her and the both of you want something long term, messing things up with sex so early won't make a bit of sense.  It truly takes time to get to know a person and once sex is involved the getting to know each other part is out.  Then sex has to play a major part in the relationship and once you get tired of that you have nothing left to hold onto. That's why so many people that have a lot in common don't work out so show her what she really means to you by waiting and let her see how special you are for doing so.|`|29772c3a68c5c632300ff3ae55102ef5aa	From what you are saying,  she probably feels the same way you do.... You shouldn't have to say anything.... Let it happen naturally....

Good Luck Romeo......|`|0856612dea2b0429e15560571a7b154aaa	When the time is right you both will know.  There are stages in a relationship that need to be met otherwise it will feel too rushed.  So just feel her out about how she feels about the relationship and it will happen in its own time.  Perhaps she is feeling the same way.  Have her go to a Slumber Party then she will perhaps feel more into it. tiffany.izatt@slumberparties.com    www.slumberparties.com|`|2a79511ae6b0ee44e70f5d4d1d31b31caa	You are sounding selfish.. you say you havent' had sex in a while. It would be much better to wait til you know alot about each other than to just spring a situation upon her like that. She may think your deseprate or just out to get her goods.

We never did discuss it and we didn't even do anything for a while. When it did happen it was so romantic and a night eithier of us have not forgotten. We can both remember every detail of that night. So I say don't talk to her about it, when the moment is right it will just happen and it will be better than if you discussed it. If you do try and discuss it with her she may be offended and feel like you are just after her for sex.
AA11128738	To be honest if the guy doesn't know what he's doing then it's pretty lame and doesn't do anything for you.

I think you should clarify the situation before, to know what she thinks of you.  Remain the same, anyway: that is the reason she likes you as a friend ! Why would she look for something else in a boyfriend ?  Just change your attitude to her: be closer, more attentive to what she desires, more consideration... Try to ask her about her intimity, and you'll see how she'll react !    Good luck !|`|AA11891399	She might be secretly hoping that you ask her out. Who knows? Stranger things have happened.

Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast,  it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking.  It is not easily angered,   it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil,  but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts,   always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails  There is no difficulty that enough love will not conquer;  no disease that enough love will not heal;  no door that enough love will not open;  no gulf that enough love will not bridge;  no wall that enough love will not throw down;  no sin that enough love will not redeem...  It makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble;  how hopeless the outlook; how muddled the tangle; how great the mistake.  A sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all.  If only you could love enough you would be  the happiest and most powerful being in the world....  real love never dies~|`|d932459e0c3b22ca61d1e757f01a17c7aa	Love is patient, love is kind, love doesn't envy, love isn't self-seeking or prideful, love is not easily angered, doesn't delight in the bad things you do but is happy with the good things you do, love doesn't always tell you about all the wrong things you do  Love perserveres, love never fails, love always hopes

Try to keep yourself busy - do a new hobby, go out for a beer with your friends.  Go buy new clothes and maybe even a new hairstyle! So that you will get more confident with yourself.    You are worth more - and she doesnt deserve you, so just let her go because it will hurt even more.    If i where you i would consider the option to find a new job.    You might even find a job more interesting/challenging than you have.  For all that we know you might find even a better job than you have!

Think of her bad points.  Don't think of the good.  Go out, and try to find another girlfriend.  Yes, it would be a rebound relationship, but you don't have to get serious about the rebound girlfriend.  But at the same time, it will help you over your ex.  Then you can move on with someone else.  It may even turn out to be the rebound girl, and that would be okay so long as you love her for herself.    It's possible that if your ex sees you with someone else, she'll be jealous and want you back.  No guarantees though. You can cross that bridge when you come to it. You may decide you simply don't want her anymore.    I hope you feel better soon.|`|AA12170170	I've been through this too. It seems like when we feel our own pain it is stronger than anyone else's. Just remember that other people have survived it and you will too! When I brake up like that it is best to find friends and other people to surround yourself with. Don't sit in the apartment. I know it's hard but get out and get around people. I also suggest changing jobs and company. That is a horrible distraction to endure everyday. Try to volunteer also. I helped handicap kids after my big break-up to keep myself busy; and after I witnessed their hard life it made me feel like my problems were petty.If you had one girlfriend you will surely get another with whom you can make great memories!

Trust me...she did you a favor.  "When one door closes, another one opens."  Give yourself time.  Try to obtain a position elsewhere.  Face your pain head on and get it over with.  Take on new projects or interests.  Move if you can.  Maybe a new roommate could help with the expenses and keep you company.  If you know any attractive ladies that would help you, have them drop by the office to see you.  It will show her you have moved on.  You can't believe how wonderful it will make you feel.  Although it won't make you feel any better right now; you will eventually see that you are better off without her.  There are plenty of nice ladies out there who have been through what you have.  They will understand.  Keep your hope and faith and you'll be fine.|`|5562411c1f650e6f6b02d39e27144b9eaa	Find a new love of your life.

Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.

They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain.

I know it's painful right now, but there is a whole beautiful world out there for you. Stop hurting yourself by replaying old memories (should've, could've, might've been). Perhaps it would help if you changed jobs or just took some time off from work. Right now, you are letting her continue to hurt you even though it's over and in the past. You are being your own worst enemy...and you're letting her get the best of you (which obviously she wasn't deserving of in the first place...or she would've see that in you and appreciated it). Move on...there are so many wonderful women out there waiting for someone special. But you won't even notice them if you keep dwelling upon "the one that got away".

d6dce86c09ffc456045418cb13817a08aa	First of all, while they're dating, don't do anything to make them mad, especially her. While you and your bff are hanging out, flirt with him, or tell him how you feel...it sounds easy, but believe me, it's not...usually best friends of the opposite sex like each other, and that';s how many good relationships start. Give it time and he'll finally realize that in the end, he didn't have to look far for the girl of his dreams, either that or you'll just become better friends if nothing works out, but good luck, otherwise.|`|AA11853350	u've asked like the same question 6 times   WOW ur really desperate   im going to|`|30457c1158972526ce5a920452223741aa	it doesn't sound like he is ur bf if he has a gf|`|AA12126489	girl go get him he might feel the same way about you to forget that other girl

AA12218482	Yes you can---this is actually suggested if your child is in a life threatening situation and has not been baptized for you to do so.   All you need to baptize your child is liquid such as water but any liquid will work in emergency situations and then make the sign of the cross of the child's forehead, lips, and chest. And say in baptize this child in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit.  It is said that a child need not be baptized more than once.|`|b621faedf42d72a5c7ed54b94d7879e0aa	I don't think so. They have to be baptized by an ordained minister/preacher. I was baptized when I was around 10 by the preacher at our church.|`|d70829ae79a7d8c646ddcaeeb83866b8aa	no but u can take he/she to a church|`|1c1a123b9d50af46f70ecb3b9553d4d9aa	No one in scripture baptized their kids.  John the Baptist, Peter, the rest of the apostles, Timothy, and other orained in the Church baptized people.  If parents did not baptize their kids in the Bible, then I would not do this.|`|b680403e565d68a18dccebd6297646c5aa	You can dedicate your child.  Depending on your faith.   If you do not belong to any particular church it's your child, you can do whatever you want.  You can dedicate your child to God, whatever your belief system is.  There is no law that says you can't.  There isn't even a law that says in the bible that you cannot baptize your own child. Man made law maybe.  But it's not God's law.  I went to Catholic school(25 yrs ago) for 8 yrs of my life, and I dont' recall a chapter in the bible that said "only a man of the cloth can baptize a child".

Sometimes its a first date (like me and my gf), but we were already very comfortable doing that because we had been friends for a while and we already really cared about each other.  there is no time requirement, but wait till he takes your hand, it should be the guys job to grab your hand atleast the first time.  After that you can take his too, but he's gotta make the first move

Technically though, you can orgasm and not climax since there are two types of orgasm.  I cant remember the exacts words, but there's  a mental orgasm and a physical orgasm and it's possible to separate the two.   The mental orgasm is always the climax and typically it does occur with the physical orgasm, but again, it's possible to separate the two.|`|8cb0a799b5a5a63809c5279d11615b53aa	when you use an earbud, its like asking who gets pleasure - both r similiar honey..

Harmonious unification of both within woman eliminates doubts, then she knows. If there is a conflict, that creates emanations which is easy to sense. Still, it is a tapestry, not simple.By the way woman capable to predict too.
56a790cbf28b0882b43224fe2ed90e46aa	I would continue to guide your son the way you are. Just ask him how he would feel if somebody called him that name.

Lots of times children act out like this if they are upset.|`|AA12291390	this is a very hard situation, you must continue to teach your child right from wrong and hope the good over rides the bad. maybe your influence will be stronger than your ex's. Best of luck!|`|2eacd2dfeca690c1712874d7d08e75fcaa	Talking to your ex will probably yield nothing if he is the type to do this to start with. You can continue to teach your son tolerance but it would be more readily learned by showing him the tolerance.Explain to your son that you don't agree with what his father says about other people Don't slam Dad, just say you disagree with what he says. Show him you are tolerating his father's opinions. Not agreeing, just tolerating. Explain to your son that he hurt the other children's feelings when he called them names. Then show him tolerance and acceptance of others whenever you get the chance. You didn't say how old your son is but from the easter bunny picture, I imagine quite young, and impressionable yet. Maybe letting him join in a local food drive, or other community based helping project will allow him to see that people cannot be judged by what they wear or where they live. Continue to reinforce your feeling's whenever possible. You have him 5 days. That gives you more time to undo the damage done in the two he is with Dad.  Be consistent and open with talking with him about other people and reinforce the issue about hurting people's feelings. That should appeal to his good heart and open nature.|`|889a37172b3ed2d95296a1e6b0de29c0aa	Your son needs your guidance.

It is very sad that he does not see what he his really teaching his child racism,hate, and to be judge mental. Children of that age do not see any difference in people's race,sex,class. Those types of behaviors are taught. You seem like a very good mother and i am sorry that your ex is such an A.S.S.. Just keep teaching your son right from wrong and someday maybe your ex will grow up or your son will grow up and see his father for what he is.  Sincerely* Gracie

There have been times when we started she wasn't there but before we finished she was on the period, mother nature has a funny way of showing up at times you don't want her. You have to be careful though because during this period the vagina is very sensitive and could be painful to your partner. Ask her about this and if it painful suck up your pride and put it away for another day. If not then go for it and remember there is a chance for a second round in the shower......|`|AA12376721	i hear that its ok- but i would not recommend it- it is just donw right gross|`|d8f014cbabae0422464fb52a9143baabaa	I think that is totaly disgusting in my opinion.

AA12126833	I am a single/divorced parent of 2 girls. The most important thing to teach your girls are:    1. A man in your life is wonderful, but not necessary  2. Always know what you are worth-Tell them they are more than arm candy, a booty call, or a casual affair.   3. Self respect. Respect yourself and others will do the same, and if they don't, kick them to the curb immediately.    I hope you remember hese simple rules. It sounds like the man in your life is only in your life, not theirs. Remember that you and your girls are a package deal. Loving just you isn't enough. You and your girls will be together for life. Find a man who wants to have a relationship with all of you. Good luck|`|AA12199970	Expect there to be some issues.  The age window where they form their view of males is pretty short.

We all think that the first peron is going to be the only one, then the one after that too. All we can do is try to teach our children differently.

Your posture when you are "talking" to her can send something to her...the list goes on and on. Trust your feelings and let your heart find a way to "speak" to her.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	1. The most important thing is eye contact when flirting. This is really the one single golden rule of flirting! Sounds easy, but can initially be difficult to establish for longer than a second or two. So when you next go out, find a guinea pig to practice on! Once you have decided on your target, look directly at him/her, then look away and always accompany this look with a smile. If they seem not to have noticed you, look again and this time smile directly at him/her. At first this really will be hard but once you get a reaction you will find your confidence will increase.     2. Once they have noticed you it is worthwhile having a few lines prepared for when they come over. However, if this does not happen, despite what you thought was a good reaction to your earlier eye contact, why don't you try approaching him/her? It could be that they are feeling just as unsure as you, so it's better to try rather than wonder what might have been.     3. When you do get to talk to them, always remember to be pleasant and smile whilst flirting - this will help put the other person at ease and also gives the impression that you are relaxed, even if inwardly you are shaking with nerves!    ~hope this helps. If you have more questions please do not hesitate to ask!|`|f542ad7f68b8ea1b56e6734b14fdc691aa	When you say YES you mean NO and when you say NO you mean YES.

This is something that he has to decide on his own.  I know that you want to help him but the best way to do that is to talk to him and tell him how you feel about the situation.  You say that he can talk to you about things, so you should take that opportunity and just talk to him.  Tell him how you feel, tell him you want him to get help.  Sometimes thats all it takes, if he really wants to stop he will and if he really cares about you he will get help.  But in the end he is the one who has to make the decision, the decision can't be forced on him that will make him worse.

She is no longer with us, as she passed Oct. 14th, 2001. She was only 34 years old. All of us sisters and my mom and dad tried numerous times to get my sister help. She was in and out of rehab. She quit using several times but she seemed to be a MAGNET to other users out there and eventually, she always went back to using. I wish I could tell you that there is something that you can do but really, there isn't. It is up to the "user" to quit abusing drugs. That person has to want to NOT do it anymore. Until then, you'll be in for a roller coaster of emotions, and heartache.

He needs help, and the others on here are right - addiction is powerful enough to make people lie, even to their closest friend.  PRAY - A LOT.  Talk to al anon and nar anon and even your parents.  He needs help, and your tears may get it for him.  It may require him to hit bottom before he gets help - but that's a risky business and he could die.  If you tell your parents and he goes to jail or juvenile hall or rehab, you may save his life.  Don't wait.  If he gets mad, let him know you did it because you can't imagine a world without him in it.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	1. The most important thing is eye contact when flirting. This is really the one single golden rule of flirting! Sounds easy, but can initially be difficult to establish for longer than a second or two. So when you next go out, find a guinea pig to practice on! Once you have decided on your target, look directly at him/her, then look away and always accompany this look with a smile. If they seem not to have noticed you, look again and this time smile directly at him/her. At first this really will be hard but once you get a reaction you will find your confidence will increase.     2. Once they have noticed you it is worthwhile having a few lines prepared for when they come over. However, if this does not happen, despite what you thought was a good reaction to your earlier eye contact, why don't you try approaching him/her? It could be that they are feeling just as unsure as you, so it's better to try rather than wonder what might have been.     3. When you do get to talk to them, always remember to be pleasant and smile whilst flirting - this will help put the other person at ease and also gives the impression that you are relaxed, even if inwardly you are shaking with nerves!    ~hope this helps. If you have more questions please do not hesitate to ask!|`|AA10293793	i hope i am not about to tell you how to deceive a woman into the sack.... this is what does it for me.. it should all come naturally if your feelings are involved as well as your hormones.  inuendo.... basically, i like a guy that makes it clear he is interested but leaves it to me to make the first move.  lots of subtle hints, but keep your distance... keep her wondering... one minute act like she is the center of your world, the next laugh it all off and be distant. but this needs to be subtle or else it will just tick her off.  also, do the inner conflict deal... things like.. focus on her eyes or her lips as if they were the most beautiful thing on earth just long enough for her to notice, then look deliberately away, as if you're trying not to stare... a relapse here and there... lean in a little, as if you were going to kiss her, but then stop and let her kiss you instead...|`|AA11248497	you'd have to dance with me. i love to dance. that's the way to my heart.i'd be all over a guy who did that.|`|70968e30e0ba1173275146ec66b5eda3aa	be cool and carm.

Both have irrational fears about vacuum cleaning.        3. Both mark their territory.        4. Neither tells you what's bothering them.        5. The smaller ones tend to be more nervous.        6. Both have an inordinate fascination with women's crotches.        7. Neither does any dishes.        8. Both fart shamelessly.        9. Neither of them notice when you get your hair cut.        10. Both like dominance games.        11. Both are suspicious of the postman.        12. Neither understands what you see in cats.              HOW DOGS ARE BETTER THAN MEN        1. Dogs don't have problems expressing affection in public.        2. Dogs miss you when you are gone.        3. You can train a dog.        4. Dogs are very direct about wanting to go out.        5. Dogs understand what "NO" means.        6. Dogs mean it when they kiss you.        7. When dogs play "fetch", they don't laugh at how you throw.        8. Dogs are color blind.        9. Dogs understand if some of their friends aren't allowed to come inside.      Just want to make you laugh. Alright then. Just be happy, enjoy your life, okey?|`|AA11939205	When you get a little older and have a wider variety of men to choose from, you'll learn that not all men are dogs!

That all goes back to , if you GIVE them the opportunity.

But putting that jokingly aside, not all men are dogs.  You just have a habit of ending up with men who like to mess around.  That is a conscious choice that you make and for that you pay the price each and every time.  You should go out and find a nice man who will wine and dine you. Wine and dine him back as well..go 50/50...equal rights for everyone.^@^  Maybe something happened to you when you were young that affected you in somehow.  Maybe that person violated your trust or etc.  But you should break the pattern by finding somebody who care for you and love you.  Your ex had some serious demons he needs to have worked out that happened to him at a younger age and he needs to fix it.  But to say all men are such dogs is SO not true, just cast off the bad guys and don't attempt to sabotage relationships with the good guys. We are out there, aren't we brothas?  Good luck sweety.

You are only 13 so you can't move out. I can only suggest to get as many activities out of the house as you can. Maybe you won't have to spend so much time there. Don't get in with a bad group of friends though, you need to save money when you can start working and move out when you graduate from school. Hope this helps. Take care.|`|4f8ab7832df1f7c23f292a84f72cad57aa	i can so understand where you are coming from - from the time i was born until i graduated highschool i had moved 23 times... my first grade year i went to 3 different schools in 3 different states    i hate it when someone asks me where i am from - i always tell them to pick a year....even after i graduated i moved quite a bit..    it wasnt all bad though - it met a lot of different people, have been to places that most only dream of..    you do have to realize that perhaps your mom is doing the best that she can - i doubt that she wants to move as much has you have - i would just about bet that she hates it as much as you do.. when you voice your concerns about the size of the house and the frequency of the moves you are probably voicing the same things that goes through her head...      it sounds like things are a little tense between the 2 of you right now - she probbaly isnt any more happy with the situation than you are..    you are 13 - its a ruff enough time in your life - but you are no longer a child - try talking to your mom in non-accusatory tones - not just about your concerns but about how she feels about it...  maybe if you took the time to understand your mom she might take the time to understand you...|`|5d33c14d2c4ba67289c30a288d64d243aa	Hang in there kiddo, although things may seem rough right now, know that your mom is trying to do her best and that if there is anything that you can do to help her out with you, you should try to do it. I know that moving around is hard and the school thing really sucks alot. But be patient and I am sure that it will work out for you. Things happen for a reason and we may not always see and understand why they are happening, but we have to learn to deal with issues as they arise.   Hurting yourself is not the answer either. Find something to do to take your mind off of the problems. Such as riding horses, writing in a journal, dancing singing what ever you can do to put the NEGITIVE energy into.   Good luck and God bless you and yours. Keep your head up!

e4de789f969deb6495194f9aa4d4b335aa	give this person time to respond. If you havent heard in a few weeks try again. If you can contact family members of this person to see if you can get a phone number or just gauge if the person has spoken to them about you to get an idea if this person really wants to speak to you. Are there issues as to why you have not spoken for a while? If there is you may be over it but this person may not and they may need more time to resolve these issues for themselves. Hopefully they will get in touch soon and you can be friends again. This person needs to build a bridge and get over it!|`|AA12164726	Give them a couple of weeks to answer if you don't hear anything, try giving them a call may be they have moved and didn't receive your letter. If you have a mobile number this would be even better. You should be able to judge whether they want to resume the friendship by the tone of their voice. Good Luck

Write down what you want to say, and practise it before hand.     Be striaght with him, otherwise he may be left confused.    Tell him how you feel and tell him what you want from your relationship, and then ask him how he feels and ask him what he wants from your relationship.     If your expectations don't match, then you will either need to compromise or go seperate ways.    Hope this helps.|`|21be3c05f0536f4b74feeeec90b6d4faaa	Run him over and say thanks for the gift and keep on driving.Kidding don't worry about him getting on the defensive side you said he will anyway.Simply tell him how you feel that you are bored in the relationship.That you need him to tell you ways to spice it up.That it isn't as fun as it use to be.If that doesn't work brush HIM under the carpet.|`|AA11663573	Turn him on and make him feel like a king|`|6a648399b74d5a82faead69b7ab81860aa	Try writing him a letter or something that expresses how you feel to the fullest. Or, when you talk to him tell him that you're not blaming him for anything or trying to make him mad, you just want to express your feelings and have him listen to you. Whenever you see him getting frustrated with what you're saying, pause and explain to him that you just need to get it off your chest. Hopefully he will lighten up and try to listen. Make sure you talk to him at the right moment though. If he's having a really good time don't talk to him. He'll just get mad that you're bringing stuff up and ruining his happy mood. Catch him in a neutral mood. I hope some of this helps. Good Luck!
AA12083470	A lot of women like that for some reason.  Just like women staying in bad relationships.  They either have very low self-esteem or they like being miserable.|`|59c8f4212f009359d60957ad096fbdf2aa	from my past that was along time ago  being a jerk worked most of the time.  I had a best friend that treat girls like crap and they did him like he was a god.

I suspect you are (as most of us tend to do) giving him what _you'd_ like, which may not be what he'd like.    That said, I think he'll like it.  My only advice is to make sure you're not too worn out at the end of the day to have sex or whatever stage you two are at.  I've had a few birthdays where my wife decided to cook some huge elaborate meal and then went to sleep exhausted early.  The meals were delicious, but I would have preferred mcdonalds, sex, and curling up to watch a movie.|`|9c5917a52a51110bd6e05189d59382deaa	Guys, in General, don't like a lot of fuss. It gets in the way of other things and can cause arguements. Unless you've done it before and he liked it, do not plan out the hole day. Just be spontaneous and relax a little. If things don't go to plan with your day you'll only end up getting stressed out and it will be no fun at all. The back rub thing sounds good as does the breakfast in bed. You could just stay in bed a little longer and bonk each others brains out. It would set the mood for a perfect day. I f you want to make him happy, do what he wants to do, not what you think he wants to do or what you think might be best for him. Just chill out man.|`|AA11831307	Pamper him with what he would like,find out what he wants and work on those things that he would enjoy.|`|AA11938688	How about STFU, drop to your knees, and open wide.

Chances are someone else is going to pick up this man and try to fix him, which would be a bonus for you.  After seven years, there's not much fixing needed...he's sort of broken beyond repair....time to get a new one.  Which brings me to the new guy.  I know that I"m going to catch a lot of flack for this, but I truly empathize with your situation.  If there is a possibility with your friend and he has a job, shows potential and there's an attraction....go for it.

She is doing this to validate herself because she has self-doubts.      It probably makes her feel more powerful to distract your man's attention away from you.    Too bad for her.  To get your man's attention back, stroke his ego better than her.  Sure it's flattering for a guy to have female attention, but he would rather have it from you.    Don't worry about her.  Don't lose your cool or she will know she is winning at her game.  And I am sure your man enjoys feeling saught after and faught over.....    Really, feel sorry for her that she is a lonely, old and bitter woman.  Don't be like her.

Mas o que faz a vida a dois ser ideal  exatamente isso: ser forte o suficiente para suportar algum, am-lo incondicionalmente "apesar de" e "ainda que", continuar mesmo nas derrotas e problemas. Isso leva  felicidade, porque aperfei?oa a alma, como uma pedra que amola o metal. Porm, tudo depende do material de que voc  feito.  A felicidade n?o  algo, ou algum e sim os momentos em que voc se entrega para sentir-se vivo e interligada com o universo do qual voc faz parte.   difcil reconhecer a felicidade se voc est apegado a fatores materiais,  coisas, porque as coisas podem te satisfazer, mas nunca te trar?o a felicidade verdadeira.  Mas h um "caminho sobremodo excelente" que  fazer os outros  felizes, dar um pouco de aten??o ao em vez de procurar aten??o, amar em vez de procurar ser amado. Buscar a felicidade do outro em detrimento da nossa. Isso n?o  a felicidade ainda, mas leva  satisfa??o da alma que por sua vez leva  felicidade das coisas simples.  A vida a dois,  relacionada  felicidade porque tem tudo a ver com um exerccio contnuo de aceita??o e amor. At Deus disse que n?o era bom o homem ficar sozinho.   Tenha certeza de que todos temos uma "costelinha" para nos completar. Mas n?o siginifica que temos que nos juntar com algum, mas que o amor entre duas pessoas, ainda que plat?nico,  umas das formas de se aproximar do Amor maravilhoso que Deus criou.  Abra?os|`|356e66d308f979b09786391a15c59a9aaa	vc tamben  muito simpatica !!! me passa seu email para gente tc !!!! beijossssss a resposta da sua pergunta com certeza podemos ser felizes sozinhos mais a dois  bem melhor|`|bc591113106f707f826a3df8ec852fd1aa	Aprendemos desde crian?as que um homem e uma mulher devem se unir e encontrar a felicidade, crescemos assistindo filmes e novelas onde as pessoa s s?o felizes quando casam  e encontram um grande amor.

AA11309933	I think you should ask yourself two questions first.      One, do you work with her closely in a team?  If so, you may not want to ask her because if she rejects you it may be very awkward.  If she is in a different department, go for it!     Secondly, do you really like her a lot?  If you do, it may be worth asking just so you don't regret anything...but it may make your professional relationship somewhat strained as mentioned above if she says no.  Always be prepared for the consequences.  On the other hand, if she says yes..try to keep your dating on the down low..because people may gossip and you don't want that until you have been going out for awhile.  Once you have been going out for awhile, then you can tell others.    Good luck.|`|32a8e3a19ed991c0adc6d161cbdc58feaa	yeah|`|AA11435916	well ask her...don't keep waiting and wondering what she will say...go for it!

You should have stayed single for a while to get yourself together, but it's too late for that now.    It's good to see that the new guy is treating you right, but you have yet to get rid of the baggage from your past relationship and it's rearing it's ugly head by you accusing the new guy of things your ex used to do.    You need to put that in check quick otherwise things will begin to get ugly with the new guy. A lot of guys will not put up with women who have unresolved issues from past relationships

AA11330458	I agree with you 100% on this. Most women think just because they came across a guy that was shallow that all men are like that. This is why sooo many nice guys in the world are left single & lonely because us woman never give them a chance, we always think they are like all the others.Its ashame, a lot of woman are labeled "sluts" and "easy" by guys just because the guy has had a bad expeirence with a woman of the past, I seriously think people need to grow up & freakin understand that not everyone is the same.|`|0971a6c8418b44b5534e2fd38207cab4aa	you are correct because i no i make sure im fresh when i step out and i no a male will see that before my personality.

Everyone has a different opinion of what makes a person physically attractive. Lucky for us, not everyone looks alike! I do agree that looks are the reason you initially become drawn to someone you don't know, and then their personality is the reason you stay with them or not. Sometimes though, you meet someone you're not attracted to at first but the more you get to know them the more attracted you get... this seems to work in reverse too. I have also met some absolutely physically beautiful people only to have their personalities (or lack of!) make them seem totally UNATTRACTIVE! It's nice to hear a guy that's unafraid to voice his honest opinion, whether or not everyone agrees!|`|2644259d7de8478d97da5240b024af35aa	Looks are the most important thing in life. If you are ugly, then you will be alone for the rest of your life. It's all about looks. Look at me: I have a big nose, a skinny face, a long neck and balding. Women find me utterly repulsive. That is why I am 33 and still a virgin. Never had a girlfriend and never kissed a girl.|`|AA12283401	Like I said in a previous question you asked (and im like answering your questions, I went to your profile and answer all questions that are open) my boyfriend's first attraction towards me was my a-s-s then (after going out) he liked everything else about me; so much that we are getting married. So girls that think that all guys ONLY CARE ABOUT THE LOOKS have not experienced a good guy in their lives cause guys DO look at physical attraction for like a minute then go to the way you present yourself and then to your personality|`|AA11764328	BRAVO!|`|AA11353414	fine. BE THAT WAY see if i care|`|60aee828c743ea7eda804d7341e79c38aa	ITS A SOCIETY THING. WE'VE GROWN UP WITH THE FALSE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE BEAUTIFUL TO GET A MAN OR KEEP ONE, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD YOU SEE AN AWFUL LOT OF UNATTRACTIVE WOMEN THAT ARE HAPPILY MARRIED.|`|AA11518991	For the most part...the reason we assume all guys are jerks is that most of us have been hurt by these jerks....and it makes it easier to deal with the pain if u assume thst sll guys are jerks and it wasn't just one that u picked...u see?|`|76bef77f310b4986d50eeaa3db46b02daa	I can honestly say I have never said that, and I agree with you about the whole looks and personality thing. I actually try to talk to guys who aren't that attractive. It sometimes makes their day.|`|3105bc1144677e617e4a729b8d0bd8ddaa	your right bub. it upsets me all the time cause i am far from a jerk guy. but I'm always getting used by women cause I'm nice... and then hear them complaining about their cheating bf's lol!|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	yea that's true what you're saying.but face it,a LOT of guys care mostly how a women looks.I'm not saying all of them,but AT LEAST 85% or more of them do.|`|AA11588361	THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. I THINK SOME GIRLS ARE ACTUALLY STUCK ON THEMSELVES AND WANT REINFORCEMENTS FROM MEN!!!|`|42df1ee43205e64e82376f160b4b42dbaa	you go boy!|`|a71e7621145a45bb98739bf8c1b91e2aaa	well said i like the way you put that and im glad to finally see a guy not only care about looks|`|13cecd8b1b70e22fd2a5b7bdaee01888aa	A bigger question (and I'm allowed to say this because I'm a girl) is why does it surprise women that guys DO care about looks? It goes back to our caveman days...men instinctively look for a woman that looks healthy and would bear his children(clear skin & eyes, healthy hair, defined hips and breasts). Women instinctively look for a "hunter-protector". So while women don't necessarily care about well-defined abs, most are not attracted (at least at first) to a scrawny, weak looking guy. While we have evolved enough to get past first impressions, I think women would be a lot happier just accepting that it's man's nature to care about looks.|`|12d885a9f4bfa96fa774cbfc50b628e4aa	It appears to me, that you've answered your own question.  Not everyone thinks the same way.  Believe it or not, we like to look at a nice bottom and thighs also.  I don't think that makes us jerks.  Apparently, the women who ask you this question, are not big on thinking.  It's time to swim in another pool darlin.|`|AA10203222	Well thank you for being one of the men that does not only care about looks...that is very sweet of you|`|AA10551683	Well said.|`|0744f995b93aee6a0f9b1b631fd744ffaa	well like you said not all of us think that. i mean i dont think that. some guys are really nice and liek you for what u r not who......and i think i found a guy like that...but dotn think every girl thinks that
434c857b4e15d165f4b5ceb45986e931aa	It really depends on yor man..........Me for example, little things mean alot. When I get home for work, I like approx. 30 minutes to just veg. Take off my shoes, unwind, fix a drink etc.etc. If you two are good communicators, you should have no problems.......One thing I will say on both you and yours part, NEVER lose spontaneous (sp?) actions, they go along way it keeping a relationship alive and fresh!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12162653	Understanding, patient, a good communicator, willing to try new things in bed, loving, a good mother, they have to put up with alot of bs with men.  It takes a bunch to be a good wife!|`|689a44cc7843ed13c2a67e04aa412e43aa	Most women try to be mind readers. (expecting men to know when they are upset, to know what they want, etc) Men are totally opposite. If something is wrong, you will know. Women need to learn how to speak man-glish and men need to learn how to speak woman-glish!!!|`|AA11610088	fun,loving,hard working,caring,and good on bed|`|AA11939205	A great personality, spending quality time and having a great disposition with children.

551bedc9fb3d1715802bd65a00688fd8aa	i wouldn't say you were stupid it sounds like you are just following your heart, it think doing this can destroy our lives cause we will tend to follow the things we want the only thing i can suggest is think really hard about your situation and use your head rather than your heart, weigh up what is best for your situation, what your needs are and what your children's needs are, you could try taking a step back from this man and seeing if he wants you and will chase you for more than fulfilling his own needs    you obviously have a heart and a very caring one at that to so find what it is that you want and what is best for you and your children and chase it    good luck with all that you decide and chose to do|`|ece86f8fbed47ba5c958a31f8c13a2e2aa	it says you have been with a marred man for 5 yrs ? is he married to someone else ? and you just have kids with him . if so then you are just  a mistress to fullfill the needs his wife cannot. i have read the other statments and it doesnt seem like they even caught it .   but anyways if he is married adn not to you then hes not going to change . you either have to accept it or move on and raise your kids|`|90227416b64283c18728255de7b9afc9aa	Think about your children...he comes back because you let him...your better then that, take control of you feelings. Stop letting him hurt your family, you and the kids deserve better.|`|553a517c8da568e732818b870d9e9527aa	Because you let him come back on his terms.    You want more, ask for it.|`|77142ee6cba27ce882366ae991d4849baa	You're a convenient outlet for whatever he needs at the moment.  You fill desires in him (not just sexual) without him having to pay any price for them (emotional, financial, etc.)  Don't you know when you're being used?  In more ways than one?|`|AA10287744	Your name is just right for you since you honestly believe this man may have feel lings for you. You said you have 2 kids by him and he doesn't have anything to do with them. What will you tell them when they ask about their dad? That he was married and couldn't play or watch your games since he had another family somewhere else. What were you even thinking to get started with a married man? I hope you find the courage to kick him out of your life and make sure your children are well taken care of a man who didn't care enough to leave the first family. I have nothing for you as far as feelings of sorrow because you were the one who made these choices.|`|0525a39d91f1af8426a354d87bd840b7aa	HELLO>>!! It is the sex.|`|62306d55a0e3944944003af500ff3e5eaa	He is haveing his cake and eating it too.  He is using you for all the things he doesn't get at home.  Then goes back to the comfort and security of his home, wife and family.  You need to kick him to the curb, get his child support for those babies, and move on cause you are better than a door mat....good luck|`|AA10701337	Welcome to marriage.  it's different for everyone, but if you have real concerns about the feelings issue, tell him.  You have kids together.  He has to know that you need him to be more involved.|`|d9a0ad9ca06ec30147eaae565d50b8b7aa	You have made your bed and now you must lay in it. If he hasn't left his wife in the past five years what makes you think he will ever leave her?  I understand that with children involved it makes things more difficult and maybe that is why you continue to let this man in your life and in their lives. I have to ask why continue on this way if he hurts you everyday? Do you not believe that you deserve someone who will love you and only you? and who will actually be in your children's lives!  I understand that you believe that it's not just about sex, and to you it may very well be more then just sex. BUT I have a feeling that when it comes to him... it's just that SEX.|`|e3ba57bc82017a7c49620be943c261c4aa	You're selling yourself short. Do you really enjoy sharing the man that you love? He may truly love you but at the same time he loves another woman. Maybe he just keeps dragging you along because he thinks that you will always be there. Maybe in his head he can do whatever and you will still be there to give him exactly what he wants. And at the same time you will just take what attention you can get from him. Because you think you love him so much and you can't be without him. In reality you can. And you can live without him and be a lot happier. Be honest with yourself....are you truly happy?|`|23a31f25f04101d9071eb21e3c2e3069aa	REMEMBER THIS - What goes around comes around.  First and foremost  - he's using  you.  He tells you things you want to hear, and you feel good in that moment. Yet, when he leaves, you are feeling empty.  Kids?  Now we've really messed up.  They have brothers and sisters probably and don't even know them.  Have u ever heard of incest?  Woman, get real and get over him.  Get your child support and write a letter to his wife apologizing.  She will hate ya at first, but she should know as well.  Also, are you sure you're the only one he's sleeping with?|`|b0cc77f01c0dfbe651587b8651890835aa	Oh dear.  Your life will follow your focus.  You are focused on something that is negative right now.  Look around!  There are better things out there for you.  It's your choice.   And you're not stupid--stupid people don't ask questions.  My advice:  walk away with dignity and start looking for the good stuff . . .  because this ain't it!

AA11404078	I feel bad for you because of your two children and your dad's terminal illness.    Nevertheless, you shouldn't have to tolerate the stress your man is placing on you.  He sounds negative in the sesne that he thinks your relationship won't last because of his 6 day work week.  I'd seriously consider asking him to leave your parents home and get out of your life.|`|86b5585612645a97b6d28eccc31a47eeaa	.Well try to talk to your husband.You both need youre own home.You need to go to work as soon as you can.Hes frustrated with the situation and he doesnt apparently know what to do either.You should not be out doing what ever that would make a man leave real quick.|`|301c9cb0c02bb342358ad1e55775f046aa	Unless his income can support you as a stay-at-home mom, you need to talk to him about what he needs and that might mean you need to get a job and not spend money on going out.  He's probabaly very stressed out in this tough situation and it seems that all you're worried about is you.    Stop being so selfish and help your family and the father of your children. If screaming in your car will do that, then knock yourself out.|`|AA10479480	oh its too bad. please dear trust god all is ok and i pray for you|`|8c303a8d51246634cb9f99323b3b2110aa	yes|`|bfeeeba323f4bc7c404215cecafa73d3aa	Girl- a good scream  is what you need.

However, after ur drive, relax with a good stiff 1 (or more) - it's VERY good for stress and the throat after all that screaming.   (u know I mean COCKTAILS not c0ck-tail$ - though both would probably help with all the stress)   ;-)|`|9f85b7155003a4e21ac1713679974bafaa	we all feel like that, why is he so cold hearted? do you reckon he's with someone else, why care bout him when he dont care bout you and the childrens feelings, talk to him tell him how you feel, i no the last thing you wanna do is break up , but at the end of the day if he wont listen to you and stresses you out then leave him be and ps he has no right to talk bad about your father, what can you do hum people like that dont appriciate what they have and dont want happiness in their lives!!

Infatti appena cambiate gruppo, tutto si risolve. Un consiglio sincero: allontanati da lei il prima possibile, appena cambi giro di amici. persone del genere vanno assecondate se vicine ma tenute alla larga appena  possibile!  mi raccomando non farle favori, renditi conto che non  pi una tua amica! devi solo limitare i danni che pu arrecarti!|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Mandala a cagare, ti sta proprio trattando da ruota di scorta!|`|AA10215666	Ignorala non hai bisogno di lei, e neanche dei suoi amici.

If it's wrong, God will make they pay for it for all eternity when they die. It's not up to you to play God.

OOHHHH man I've got an even better idea why don't you go off with your crazy nut job Christian friends and make a real Christian statement by bombing and abortion clinic and killing people in the name YOUR God. what does your wife think of your babbling or is she not allowed to think with your input.|`|AA11831379	Choose to turn away from the abortion decision, and choose the decent human one!

I'm not an advocate for abortion or anything, but there are cases when women/girls don't have a better alternative.for example, in cases of rape or incest, I don't necessarily think they want to be reminded of that horrific nightmare for the rest of their lives, so they really don't have a choice, that doesn't mean they want to do it.|`|f141865c2a61e1f1e48f913d802cb58caa	I must say, if that is the way you think, you have no brain at all. You cannot say that women "like" abortion. That is something you have no thought in. There are many reasons why women get abortions, whether it is from rape, financial or other wise. The reason behind it doesnt matter. It is a matter of CHOICE & its something that women have to deal with for the rest of their lives. It never goes away. So where people that are "prolife" its understandable why they think they way they do, but to protest & talk s! !  against women going to have or that have already have ad the procedure done, is ridiculous & ignorant.   Its a life changing thing no matter what descision you make.

Sono cognomi regionali e quindi molto diffusi. Se vai sul sito  paginebianche e nella ricerca scrivi Cappelletti Trento, ne escono 120 solo nella citt di Trento...capisci ben che non  facile trovare quel che cerchi...ti andrebbe meglio con lisimberti che sono solo una ventina..ma gli altri sono davvero tanti. E poi c' da calcolare i paesi limitrofi e gli altri comprensori della provincia...

Not necessarily the parents, siblings, etc., but the extended family, all the aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents. I've found they either try to embarrass the person your going out with, you, or both of you. If it's the first one, it's cool because they know all the good stories about your bf/gf, but if it's either of the last 2 it can get annoying. :)    -edit- I just read Brandi's answer, and that's just a predjudiced femanist paradigm, thinking that all guys need to control their women. Get over yourself.|`|AA11479134	Women who are independent are definitely intimidating. A guy thinks that he needs to be in control of a relationship, that way he doesn't come off as needy or dependent. So when a girl doesn't need to depend on a man, he worries because he doesn't have a tight grip on her.|`|AA11392653	yeah, i'd like to know..|`|e8ef1277b90bd2fc06f1709f850f6be1aa	A GIRL WHO MAKES MORE MONEY THEN US...

If a young man is not being forward with his intentions, maybe he's hiding the fact that he's up to no good.  According to my daughter when a guy has been up front with her, he's usually very respectful afterwards.  It hasn't led to a date, because she's not really all that much into boys, but the opportunity has been there on her part if she really wanted to.  It's the boys who "steal" looks at her who are usually clowns and up to no good.  This has just been her experience.  Good luck with that.      By the way, I hope at least you're not focused on boys as a focal point of believing in yourself.  One of the credits I do give my growing girl is that she's being patient and learning more about what she wants for her future.  God Bless!|`|90234af74813de3e4cff0707c8298041aa	Walk over and fix his hair or collar for him and see what he does.|`|9ebab103025039d97f1f409b5bdd93e6aa	he probable does likes you|`|c16eeaf2f6d25463f11c95835ed50cf0aa	Try talking back to him when he tries talking to you.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	One of the hardest things to do can be to tell some guy that you like him. Why?    The bottom line is, it's the fear of rejection - we ask people other questions all the days of our lives.    Therefore in order to ask the question, you have to study what's the worst that could happen. And that is the answer "no".    But there is nothing really to fear in the word no - it just means that he doesn't value you (his loss) or just doesn't think you are compatible (best to find out now) or he is seeing someone else (fair enough).    Hope this helps~|`|6865662fa27b688c86a4b2450cb0ed73aa	If you see him regularly then just follow him whereever he goes and smile to him a lot.

Invite him to stuff, not necessarily u guys alone , maybe you and your friends with his, you know? Maybe A night at the movies, ice skating, anything. It's better hearing: "no thanx i cant go to the movies" than : "No, I don't like you."

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	One of the tried and tested problems through relationship history has been finding out whether that girl or guy you have pined over for years really likes you or not.     Should you pluck up the courage and just ask them out, or is it alright to ask their mates if they like you? This may seem easier, but in fact, in the long run it is not the best way to find out if they have a crush on you!  Ask Them Out!  I always recommend that you simply ask the person out, before it drives you crazy. It at least shows that you are serious. If they say no, then it is their loss. And if they say yes, then, well it can be the start of something beautiful. Asking them out via their friends is simply a cowardly way to do it. So go on, bite the bullet and ask her/him out today!    Hope this helps~|`|AA11305458	Ask them, "Do you like me?"    Their answer will tell you.|`|736c3bf0583a43998ceffc05c99cd3a9aa	They will flirt with you, look at you and go out of their way to either be near you and talk to you. You don't always have to be told by the other person that they like you. At work, this married man, who I have to say I never noticed until he started talking to me (who I found extremely attractive after I noticed him) went out of his way almost every day to talk to me and look at me. I could tell that he liked me. Even though he was married and his wife worked at the same place too. But he never did these things in front of her, infact he would ignore me when she was around. So, people can like you and have crushes on you and you them with just being very sublte, and innocent harmless flirting.

Once you can break the ice by having some sort of conversation with him, it should be easy to ask for his email.  What ever your conversation is about, just say,"Hey, I think I remember reading about that on the internet. Give me your email and I'll try and find the link and send it to you.....Oh I wouldn't be a teenager again for all the money in the world.....|`|AA11087479	unless you make the normal ..talking.. approach he may get the idea that you are some weird shy withdrawn person.  it sounds romantic to just pop up out of no where with a declaration of love.... but I believe you will fail.  you'll just be too shy to contact him even if you do get his address|`|8c8696d67b4124887af2e240763d468daa	Give him yours and in return he'll give you his,i think that should do it.Am shy too but i think i can do this...good luck|`|073e8c1b248e37271c7038f95e5f9e95aa	follow him to his home|`|AA11297931	ask him something that you know for sure that he has.. and tell him that you want to borrow it.. then if he said yes, ask his number so that you can remind him about it.. =D whalla!!|`|610dc85c4a005acb1325eae051a6d85eaa	wow you sound like me.

I'm in that boat. I chose not to ever have contact with her because I don't want to be "just friends" while she dated other guys. I guess you would have to be pretty strong for that.If I never see her again I'll think of the times we were together fondly and I'll miss her alot.|`|AA10888522	Yes very much so|`|adb82062cca99de4f1d0f32c358ce5dcaa	I don't think so. This exact thing has happened to me. You may still want to give it a try and hope that it was as great as it was before or maybe even better, but the reality is that you lost them because something happened. Maybe they found someone else. How do you know that you are the one and they haven't found someone better?  The only way I can see it work is that they feel exactly the same way and want to try again because they realized that you were THE ONE.
AA10065170	First of all if you have the hots for some else,  it's because you girl friend not hot to you anymore  ask her can she dress sexy for you in the bedroom  and do some freaky thing to her to keep your mine on   her, and you will all ways have the hots for her.|`|eb6c526d3f0ae2da79fc29957b11fc14aa	well my answer is dump your girlfriend go with the other girl, than if that doesn't work try again with some one else.|`|AA11939205	YOU need to get your priorities right!

If you have a lease, make sure his name is on the lease too.  Just incase he leaves you stranded with the lease or tears up the place.  Good luck.|`|AA10256921	Be honest with yourselves. Are you TRULY best friends and TRULY over each other? Is either of you in a new relationship with someone else? How would you feel if your friend brought someone home to stay overnight? How would your friend feel if you brought someone home? What if your friend's friend started practially living there (trust me, it happens)?    Do you have compatible styles for cleaning, maintenance, bill-paying, money management?    Can you communicate honestly and "adult-ly" about money, personal habits, and such?    It's can be hard to live with somebody you are not committed to (a bf or gf or spouse). Having your roommate be your best friend can help, but it has its stresses, too.    When I was in college I lived with my best friend (who stayed at her bf's all of the time) and another mutual friend (who had more $ than I and an annoying bf who was there a lot). It didn't work out.    Your school may have some resources on resolving or managing roommate conflicts if anything comes up.    Good luck!|`|15552dbbcb2505f70379948650cb7b5aaa	no. you must have an ugly past together or perhaps he will try to be with you again, it happened to me and it was horrible!

So luckily, I can tell you what it means: to douche means to cleanse a cavity of the body with a jet or swoosh of water or cleansing formula. Women use this squirt bottle that is filled with this bacteria killing liquid instead of water to clean their "girl parts". It just kills all the odor causing bacteria down there so it doesn't smell.

Recien ahi vas a saber si estas enamorada|`|53bcecc502f6fd2f89fb562b8afddc56aa	El enamoramiento es un estado alterado en el que distorsionas la realidad; ves hermosoa lfeo, el tiempo te parece eterno cuando no est y corto cuando ests con l, los lugares horribles a los que te lleva te parecen hermosos, etc. Durante el enamoramiento se hacen cosas impensables, se vuelve uno valiente, temerario, desobediente, el xtasis y el dolor ms agudo se alternan segn si est o no est el objeto de tu pasin.  Pero si lo nico que sientes son celos...  Entonces tal vez lonico que tienes es un severo caso de codependencia o dependencia emocional: Se parece al enamoramiento, pero hay dos diferencias bsicas: 1) duele ms y 2) no se pasa en dos o tres a?os, sino que se vuelve crenico.

AA12369806	1. there is nothing wrong if an indian girl marries an American twice her age  as in India also earlier in arranged marriages  there use to be an  age-gap of  upto 10 yrs also if the guy is from a very high class family n doin very good bussiness.    nobody use to mind that.    2. when any American or any other girl from any part of the world can do that then why not Indian  ---Indians r the most adjustable people.    3.one bad thing is without her parents consent. so that may be they can try latter so that they shud not feel bad.    4. they can live happily only when the American is sincere in his relationship. as for them today they r marring tommorow they r divorcing  kind of stuff is there.    so if the guy is really interested in Indian culture n indian people then only they can live happily if he is just doin it like that then they may not.|`|AA10892635	uhhhh no|`|e38404754a58a5e943d5f3b95318769eaa	You are a fool to ask this question even, can't you find some good Indian for marriage, is that going to America so important that you can ruin your family tradition for that and marry such an old fellow. Is his property of American citizen attracting you, this can't be love . You are commiting a mistake|`|db63aa1bb9c5a6927d7684220cf52f95aa	simply put no. too much culture/generation clash. all will seem fine and dandy at start...but eventually it will become apparent that the paths that had crossed initially were actually destined for different directions.|`|2c183c2d09b432b388c4cf965cb75f2eaa	No never...

She has to turn against her family's wishes which in Indian culture is similar to shooting a busload of nuns in western culture. Big no-no. A girl who claims to have good traditional values would balance the needs of her family with her heart. A man unfamiliar with her culture is unlikely to know what all of that means, and will make mistakes because he doesn't know any better.    Secondly, the guy is twice her age. I mean 10 or 11 years is pretty much the limit. Any more of an age gap, and it just gets heavy with all the creepiness. Either the girl is looking for a daddy figure or is pretty mercenary, or the guy is trying to recapture his youth or is a perv. I get shivers just thinking about the yuckiness of it.|`|546293ca02ccd67858e9b705fe555675aa	yes there no reason why not as l ong as you are of age not doing it to get back at you parent then go for it be happy love is a strang thing age is not proble i know i am in love with a young women but it only on way are that the way i feeling right but faith can move a lot of thing i belive she will love me to very soon i meet her about two money ago my life has change so if it love on both side go for it

How long have you known X? and how long have you known Y? Maybe Y likes you and does not want you to be friends with X. As far as your feelings, I know how I would feel. If X was my friend for a long time I would be hurt, but like I said take into consideration that maybe Y is trying to befriend you from X. I have a best friend who has been my friend for 12 yrs. But I cannot see my friend saying something like that. Good Luck and God Bless. Everything will turn out like it should.

c14f8d4a1c7944ae25af7c71047d3a1caa	since you are going to a new school than it would be the perfect time to just start all over. maybe some people would mistake you as a B**** becuase of some things that you did you should try to not do that. diffenetly go out for as many electives as possible. for ex. a sport maybe. after school activities are good to make friends becuase than all of the people there have something in common so you will find something to talk about with them for sure. i know it will probably be tough to just go out for something in a school where you wont know anyone, but dont worry everything will turn out great! also give people a chance to talk to you dont push them away. most important be yourself! dont try to be someone that you are not it will backfire on you. dont worry about what people say about you in the beggining becuase they dont even know you they are just talking. once they get to know you then everyrhing will be good. i think the main reason that many people especially in high school are not confident is becuase of all the people that act like they are  better than you. dont worry about those people the ones that are the popular ones in HS, because  once HS is over most of the time they arent much because they were to busy worrying about being at the top and about how they looked and all the things that seemed cool to them in HS. they just dont realize that will not matter out of HS.    i would say that  a good place to shop is gordmans, deb, jcpenny, t.j.max or just anyplace that has your style of dressing. oh and go out for an elective that interests you that way you can make friends that like the same thing as you. remember BE YOUR SELF! and everything will turn out great. oh and have fun! good luck! peace.|`|AA12083470	Just try not to be shy.  Put your best out there.  If you see someone who you would like to be a friend, just go up and talk to them.  When you start doing the club and dance team, you will be friends with all of them.  If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't be shy at all.  They are just normal people.  Get out there and live life to the fullest.|`|3a5e0802a41d6770a390c50af2d5dee9aa	Take the easiest classes you can. It will give you more time to focus on making friends. It really doesn't matter where you get or what brands of clothes you buy.  Smile as often as possible (it makes others like you more).  Let others have the spotlight as often as possible. high school is the easiest time to make friends.
AA11467993	Flirt with him. Let him know that you would like to be taken out by suggesting that you hang out or go out to eat sometime.

421dcce2d04218899e188207a7cfb2adaa	No you don't because you generally have to be a resident to file for divorce. In Nevada, if you are resident for six weeks you qualify what is termed a "quickie divorce":  Truly uncontested divorces, involving young couples who earn individual livings, have no children and have few community assets to divide, can be settled quickly.         "My record for one of those was 36 hours," said Marshal Willick, an attorney who concentrates on family law. So, it depends on your situation and how quickly you want the divorce if you are debating going to Nevada.|`|d5baf34e65bccce9569de81d9e95fe02aa	I was married in New Hampshire and divorced in Massachusetts.

If the 411 site finds your friend, buy a report, as the site calls it. Those 3 details are all you need. Approximate age would help, too, though.|`|AA11613165	E-mail address are kind of kooky - you can only find someone if they have registered on a search engine - which is VERY rare. It's easier to find someone's home address, phone and map to their front door than to find their e-mail address!    You can try at reversephonedirectory.com, then give them a phonecall and ask them their e-mail. Many directories such as bigfoot and infospace also have e-mail search features, but like I said, only if they registered and then again, if it's a yahoo e-mail, you could try in Yahoo people search!    Good luck!    Toodles

AA12083470	It's hard to tell.  I don't think there is such a thing.  Every person I have tried to get close to ends up taking advantage of me or hurting me.  Just keep somewhat of a distance.  Don't tell too personal things that might back fire in the long run.  I trusted my friend with my life, told them everything.  It wasn't a good idea.  People are out for theirselves and if they get a chance, they will turn on you.  It is hard to find good friends.

But don't front like your Done if your Not, If you want him back take him back!    But don't be stupid, you know how things rolled out last time, you need to be clear about how you feel about what happened and let him know just that, Communicate what you are willing or unwilling to deal with and depending on his response, you may go into it thinking one thing and after expressing yourself and re-evaluating what actually happened you might change your Mind about how you feel about the situation.    The real point is to be honest with yourself, You clearly don't NEED HIM, so just decide if you Want him (OR NOT!!!)

My answer will not help you much, but do know that I am in exactly the same situation and I have asked myself the same question over and over.   In the end I think its better to be broke and maybe single for a while, rather than be unhappily married forever.  Good luck and please let me know if you have found the perfect answer to the question.

Como estn sin sus parejas deciden entrar para ver si vale la pena alojarse all.     El recepcionista, un hombre muy atractivo, les explica como es el hotel...              "Tenemos cinco pisos...   vayan piso por piso, y cuando encuentren lo que   buscan, vienen a registrarse.  Es fcil decidir, porque en cada piso hay   avisos que indican qu contienen".                       As que entran y, en el primer piso,   en el aviso se lee:       "Aqu todos los hombres son psimos haciendo el amor, pero son muy sensibles y amables".   Las amigas se ren a carcajadas y sin dudar suben al siguiente...            El aviso del segundo piso dice:  "Aqu los hombres hacen el amor de modo maravilloso, pero generalmente   tratan mal a las mujeres".      Esto no les parece aceptable, as que las mujeres   Suben al siguiente piso  En el tercer piso se lee:       "Aqu todos los hombres son amantes excelentes,   y son sensibles a las   necesidades de la mujer".        Esto se ve bueno pero   todava faltan dos pisos            En el cuarto piso el aviso es sorprendente:        "Aqu todos los hombres tienen cuerpos perfectos, son muy sensibles, tiernos y atentos con las mujeres, son amantes perfectos, todos son solteros, con mucho dinero y dispuestos a casarse".  Definitivamente las mujeres estn intrigadas pero   ellas deciden ver qu hay en el quinto piso, antes de quedarse en el   cuarto  Cuando ellas llegan al   quinto piso, en el aviso dice:  "Aqu no hay hombres.  Este piso se construy   slo para probar que es   imposible complacer a las MUJERES".       si te gusto lo tengo hecho en power point, y es una presentacion con imagenes que les encantan a las mujeres buscame para mandartela.       gregrosa   @    hot   mail   .    com porque si te lo pongo pegado seria una direccion y me podrian botar de la pag ( soy un viejito )   a si aqui pudieras dar mas de 10 cuantos me darias? mmmmmmmmmmmm|`|334c1f054a3dfebce4390e79ace6c03eaa	Nos tenemos que equivocar muchas veces para encontrarla, la vida es as, todo hay que ganrselo y en el amor no va ser menos.

It happens to me all the time, and it's rather inconsequential what other women do or think.  I never, ever approach a man or initiate contact with him, but they do all the time.  I also (other than writing this on here in response to your question), don't brag about it.  It's nothing, and I'd just shrug it off.  Go with the flow.  Not everyone is going to like everyone else.|`|cb41d5c23ca37f5dcfa845618b4f9e28aa	QUIT BEING SO SELF-ABSORBED!  not every man wants you, and you create enemies if you try to make every man want you.    You probably send the message that you are available by the way you dress, for one, and two, you probably flirt a little too much.  Maybe you have a low self esteem and need to flirt and try to make guys (especially committed ones) like you so you can feel more powerful as a woman.    Get over yourself and start looking beyond your own self-serving needs.  Look for things like wedding rings, significant others, etc.  Show other women you are NOT THE ENEMY!    BIG HINT:  Most men who are out shopping at stores, are either there with their ladies, or shopping for something for them.  Guys don't typically like to shop.    Sure you may talk to men, but early in the conversation, look around for their other half, or ask them if they are with their wife today.|`|AA11710463	... because their men will strike up conversations with you ... and stare at you.

I never heard anything about it, but I know the kid was from where the movie was made and it was made in New Orleans.  So, I'm sure even if he didn't die or go missing, he had some major damage.  Wherever he is, he's 15, and Monster's Ball was the only movie he was ever in.  They basically saw him on the street, paid him very little to be called fat and get slapped around, and sent him back to where he came from.  I think they should have treated him a little better than that.    Oh yeah, and by the way, his name is Coronji Calhoun.

Next question?|`|AA11616665	Josh,  you will get over her,  it may take a little more time  but it will happen.  Some day you will look back and wonder why it was such a big deal!

AA11232415	Absolutely. If you were saying this after being apart for say 5 years , then you might have a problem. A year isn't a long time. It bruises your pride when someone you love doesn't feel the same way. Then they meet someone else and fall head over heels. It makes you feel like ; hey what is wrong with me? Wasn't I good enough? Didn't I love You enough? It makes you feel rejected and sometimes insecure. These are all normal feelings as long as it doesn't effect your current  relationship. I've found that time takes care of things like this. I don't know how old you are but I remember being a teenager . You think I'm going to love him forever . I'll never forget him. Fifteen years down the road you don't even remember his name. Life is funny like that. Don't dwell on it. Just go with your feelings until enough time has passed for you to heal. God Bless and Good Luck.|`|AA12246532	yes i would feel bad when the one i love goes behind another|`|3fc39ef3416f2b257a05d5dc8c1baeb3aa	My honest opinion, yes most people do feel sad i mean who wouldnt, but you will be sad for that momnet or may be longer but you will definetly get over it.|`|AA11277776	I think that is a normal thing.  Give yourself room to grieve and in time, those feelings will dissipate.  Time is the only way...we can pretend...we can find another lover on the rebound, but in the end we are only doing damage to our new partner and ourselves.  I know you want to move on to the next relationship, but if you are continuously thinking about your ex whenever you are making decisions with your current boyfriend then I must say you are not really in love and you are probably just on the rebound.  When in that stage we do things to make our ex jealous and hurt...I know I have been there.  I would not say split with your new boyfriend, but be honest with yourself because in the end you will not only be hurting you, but the one that is currently seeking to know more about you.  In reality you are not in a serious relationship right now, you are in pretend mode.
AA11607230	As a guy it would no bother me at all.  I know I'm not the biggest out there so what.  I have enough to make her happy and I'm OK with that.

If he can't let it go feed his ego a little bit, that way at least for one night he'll feel like a big man.    A small sized man can make a woman flop around like a fish out of water just as much as a larger man can.  It all depends on his technique, seriously!|`|33b7005880714f4feefb51e7e95ce6a5aa	You should just be honest and tell that person whatever you feel is the truth.      People need to have thick skin in this world, and not be so damn sensitive all the time.    By the way, what is the point of that conversation? I really don't get why you would talk about such a thing.  If he brought it up, you need to ask him what his F-ing problem is, and if he gets all defensive, then dump his little dick to the curb.

07b080b41caddbe8a69506dd2d05fbd8aa	Te entiendo, me pasa lo mismo, y todava trato de averiguar porq son asi los hombres.  Tan mala suerte tenemos, verdad? S de hombres que dicen: "Esa es bella pero es una larga por eso ni se interesan, otros esa es bella pero Virgen (tampoco les interesa), otros> buena onda esa chava pero Fea, Y otros> esa que Fea pero es de las que hacen de todo." Imagina, este es el mundo en que vivimos, pero S que hay alguien para m y lo importante es No perder la FE. no hay DUDA que El Hombre es Ms Activo Sexualmente que la Mujer, depende de nosotras decir hasta que punto deseamos las caricias, por lo q cada vez que se conoce un Chavo, primero es saber cuales son sus intenciones realmente. No es que todos sean Iguales, tampoco debemos hacernos las Victimas pues s de casos en que la mujer a veces es quien Juega. Y esto todo el Mundo lo sabe. Si te preocupa porq el hombre no se da por respetarnos, yo que tu cambiaria de ambiente o amigos, a veces estamos en lugar equivocado sin darnos cuenta, y para no toparte con babosos hay que aprender a tratarlos desde el principio, si te dicen que eres bonita pero no regalada, no les haras caso verdad?, lo dicen por quieren que lo seas, y lo mejor es demostrarles que te sientes a gusto como se?orita y vean lo que VALES!, y No que Fueras como otras que les vale.  Nadie tiene que cambiar solo por lo que dicen Los Insensantos y Degenerados; cuando tomes la desicion de hacer algo con tu pareja Hazlo por AMOR y nada ms. ok? SUERTE y CUIDATE!!!!|`|0cc75d9ef62ce3409eec0a871de645f5aa	Yo creo que es segn lo que entiendas por bonita, creo que las chavas bonitas provocan ternura y tranquilidad emocional y hay chavas MUUUY Guapas y SEXXXIS que provocan un sin fin de sentimientos, Creo que mujer Sexy puede despertar el lvido de cualquier hombre.|`|79527d60b2b356a2709efe241218accbaa	los hombres apenas ven una mujer piensan en sexo|`|4d6d0a43c91bb2fb75f3e3d6e06e2e0eaa	pues por que no todas las mujeres son como tu y a los hombres nos da lo mismo si dices que si o si dices que no pues si te das cuenta si no resulta contigo con otra si eres tu la que se preocupa pero para un conquistador es una conquista mas no mas y si tu no aceptas salir con cualquiera es tu desicion nadie te obliga pero tu crees que a quien le gusta andar conquistando mujeres le preocupa un no por respuesta ,no lo creo en una noche ,un no de 10 si no es nada. mas que la atraccion fisica la idea es tener sexo y nada mas.-|`|c80e7b4c61ccfaa0235f2c98a80d36e0aa	la respuesta la tienen ustedes mujeres una mujer se vuelve cuando se viste sexy es interesante cuando camina es interesante cuando baila es interesante cuando coquetea es interesante cuando respira es interesante pero cuando le dices adios preciosa y voltea diciendo-'o\\5.,??```?`?'+0,,--ooo\\\\ cab........ ahi seacaba la belleza|`|4ca1038f9cd6e3f0648f2334ee66cd41aa	Vamos a ver, aunq animales racionales, y no siempre, aun tenemos reminiscencias de lo q anta?o fuimos, simplemente animales, y los animales se guian exclusivamente de la apariencia fisica, los machos buscan hembras lustrosas, jovenes y fuertes, para q? para prolongar su descendencia, es decir, los hombres aun miran la apariencia fisica porq eso es lo han hecho desde siempre y nosotras buscamos lo mismo, pero de otra manera, nosotras buscamos la seguridad del macho joven q nos cuiden, matengan y puedan protegernos a nosotras y a nuestras crias, es la realidad, por tanto, no te amargues por eso, busca a un tipo mas evolucionado q el resto y pasa de los machos q quieren una hembra como tal y no una compa?era|`|01547f9231ed4c83831c3d2b8d544b9daa	si pareces a la de la foto ,,te ves bien buena ..|`|e22ebb448839e85c6a9a4e663df4c192aa	--->>>sexxxo|`|c4a4ff412b6a44742c26b1e1bbac476aaa	El tracero, piernas, Cuerpo,.....ojos, cara......& todo...........tu me intiendes verdad???|`|5bace78c6b8f0d2cf09141e3d81d1fddaa	Nos interesan las chicas bonitas porque nos gusta lo bonito.

AA11416225	she has done nothing. You started smoking to spite her? Wow, that's ridiculous. But as far as the feelings you have for her, I know it really sucks to really like, or love someone that doesn't love you back. Either you need to keep the friendship, let her realize on her own that the guy she's dating is probably just using her, and be there for her and hope she reciprocates, or move on and get over it. It will take time to realize yourself she doesn't love you, or like you the way you do, and if you persist, she might get upset and dissolve the friendship. The pain of someone not loving you is real. It hurts and feels like the world is suffocating you and there is no end. but there is, as always, things dissolve and life goes on. If you need to make a point of this, tell her just how you feel, and see what you two together can do to come to a resolution that you both can agree on. Meet her half way. As for losing your best friend, that is your choice to let that happen. Hope you get the girl...I always root for the underdog in romance situations, but we don't always get what we want. You can try sometimes, but you just might find, you get what you need.|`|76138df0987289c288edf73e7f5d6264aa	just accept what has happend. that's it. that's the way to not losing your bestfriend|`|AA11941380	i know how this feels. one of my guy best friends that i had a crush on, and he knows that i do, and we have acted on it a few times, went out on a date with another woman a few days ago. its just something that you have to accept and move on if you want to keep your friendship. if she knew you had a crush on her, that could be why she didnt tell u she was dating someone else. she was trying not to hurt you. but if you remain friends with her, you cannot expect her to put her life on hold because you have feelings for her, and she does not have the same for you.|`|9418b1724b96c2d632b4b125e71bfdfcaa	man up and get the ( &% over it.|`|84061c93e66e9a89020d5d4083c52f8caa	you cant be firend any more|`|da27e522fa903eed4c0e1b1a2634dad8aa	why are you losing a friend? i thought the whole idea of being friends with someone was to be supportive and care about the friend. if you care about her so much then you have to let her do what she needs to do. if she wants to be with this guy for a little while (or forever) all you can do is be supportive of her. if you fall and grovel all over her you will surely drive her away.|`|AA12269552	Seriously, a week is not a long time. She probably didn't know how to bring it up to you and maybe she doesn't really think it's going to last with this guy anyway. She didn't want to have to hurt you or deal with your hurt feelings.   I think you need to face the facts that she is just a friend and that's all it will ever be. Open your eyes and your heart.

Talk to him and see if he is ok. Sometimes people connect themselves to kindness cause it is the only thing they have seen. I doubt that is the case with this child though.

You have the opportunity to do something really great for this kid, something he will remember always, my son is 21 now and still remembers Mario. Besides why is a 6 year old out by himself anyway? That is terrible and shouldn't happen and is a strong indication that his mother is not exactly on the ball. I would get your mom involved, she should take him home and go and talk to his mom. Say you don't mind him hanging out once in a while but can't watch him all the time. That will allow your mom to get some insight in to what is going on at this kids house, he may need help and protection!

AA11940905	I watched porn to and I don't think your crazy but dont make a habit out of it..It can be bad..Now men are usually thinking about sex and they just enjoy themselves when they masturbate.Thats one thing I can admire about men is the fact that they can lay back and enjoy the feeling instead of us women that feel that we have to force an orgasm..Good Luck|`|245b118a75384bd7f5d406824001d5e9aa	theres nothing wrong with watching porn! ur just curious!|`|AA11566665	porn is not a bad thing,,i would love for my chick to be able to sit and watch       a porno with me and injoy it|`|f1b7370501e99d46e36d26d9622603c3aa	don't waste your time baby as u can't help urself out of this thing.  enjoy ur life. listen everybody but do what ever you like.|`|f6dba3b9cfa08e563c3537907d5a58d2aa	Why stop! You're normal and their odd and crazy.
AA10663412	I can understand why you are gun shy, but check this one out and start a friendship, i would say if you bring yourself into this equation the less chance of cheating to occur.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I cant say that i blame you by any means i dont think i could bring myself to believe it either..but as its said you have to" leave your past behind and start fresh with the presant partner"..wich i have a hard time doing myself concidering i have been in a lot of bad relationships. but it puts a lot of stress on a relationship not having trust either..I guess what i would do is go along with him to as many shows as you can see how they are together and make your own judgment..you maybe scared to meet her but i would do it reguardless it maybe innocent and you have to look at it as being innocent no matter how hard it is to do  "innocent" until proven "guilty".|`|AA12083470	No matter whether you meet her or not, he is going to cheat on you.  You can either threaten the woman or your husband.  If he cheated once, chances are he will do it again.  I don't know why you keep setting yourself up to be hurt.  Find someone that will love you and not cheat on you.  There are more fish in the sea.|`|52027cd756401532ad7ca46e9714db39aa	hi i  sympathize with you. I am about your age and have been through alot in my18 yr. marriage. (not cheating,that I know of) Why are you not around when they are together? Maybe you can make a point of being there when they are together. Guys love to be praised!! Make him feel like a "god".  I hope it all works out!!!|`|d9a585cb41f7adb3107128daad51b07aaa	It's natural that you're worried. You also need to explain to him that you feel you have cause to worry. Keep an eye on him, but also, trust him to do the right thing. Waiting to be hurt is never a good thing, it closes you off from him, even if you don't mean to. It'll shut him out, and he'll feel that and think you're slipping away from him. Show him you're not slipping, just worried about being hurt all over again, but also that you trust him to do the right thing.|`|9419c799c4c3386646b4c59b6232b717aa	Ma you have just had a bad stroke of luck...Those other guys were jerks and for some reason you just did not see through it. Have extreme confidence in yourself and don't worry about the other females because nothing is sexier to us guys than a confident woman!!! Now if he's been with you for 5 years apparently you're doing something to keep him there so keep it up!!!
e06b80de799a3556fae886f494b2bc78aa	well i m in a same prob too want to tell someone i like him cant tell him....dont know y but i keep trying to take out word from my mouth when he shows up.....  if u get any good solutions tell me also buddy|`|d50204aa0d42762ecb0b8a39eb068accaa	yes,    hire a skywriter|`|8e1b963083fcb766fe0657e44a15006faa	i would tell here that you lover and want to be more than just friends. say something like that when she comes over here this summer|`|9419c799c4c3386646b4c59b6232b717aa	The guy who takes chances looks upon his life with NO REGRETS...Rather than wishing you HAD done somthing JUST DO IT.....It won't hurt you physically and emotionally if it doesn't turn out the way you want it too. at least you know......|`|AA12083470	Why not?  Go for it.  If it's meant to be, it will be.|`|4c48a727d472f2068b813fb73255b9bcaa	yea if u feel that way about her just tell her how u feel about her and the way she hangs around u she will understand how u feel about her real well|`|AA12288313	If you really care about her then tell her or you will be living the rest of your life thinking "Man, I should have told her" and if she is not for something more yet then sit back and stay close to her heart because you will probably have a better chance later on.
b7409c444ac96da727c1a55be457f031aa	Where is your ex now that you are waiting for him to "get his act together"? Honestly I say do not marry either one. The guy that you are casually seeing is not someone that you are deeply in love with and you should not marry him in fear that you will be alone. Your ex whatever problems he has well...that is why he is your ex. If you are going to take him back for the long haul just make sure that you are not just settling. Marriage is a big commitment and one thta should not be taken lightly especially since there is a child involved. Best of luck.|`|a26ffdff3b93f1bf85bc63cf3929c183aa	view both of the guyz banking accounts and the one with the bigger balance should win your hand|`|AA11328507	Its not your ex that needs to get it together, its YOU.  What the hell do you mean you still love the ex?  Why the hell are you with new dude if still in love with the ex?  Your being ruthless to the new guy and living a lie. Shame on you and your foolish ways.  You need to be open and honest with yourself and make better decisions ESPECIALLY because you have a young child. Damnit!|`|AA12083470	I think you need to decide who you love and want to be with.  Then go from there.|`|eb3dc71cf957dd4c0757d7b50714b377aa	Do you love him? Where do you see yourself in 10 years? You have a child, you say, what is there oppinion in all this, if they are old enough to voice it to you, if they are to young which are they more comfortable with. Follow your heart in this decision.|`|2aa5857c4aba4c49a24c78ea5a63bc60aa	If you're still in love with your ex then clearly the answer is no you should not marry this one. Marriage is not something to be taken lightly, you don't want to get marry because "it may work out."
AA10830538	Don't force it, because some voices never will hit a high note.    Some suggestions that might help:  - Focus on your breathing.  Breathe from as low in your stomach as you can.  Practice this until it is comfortable and natural to you.  - Warm up your voice.  Sing through scales or make up patterns of notes that will go in and out of your comfortable range.  Warm up for 10-15 minutes before singing.  - Keep your throat open.  Fake a yawn and feel how your throat opens up in the back - try to get a bit of that feeling while you are singing.  This will allow for good airflow and resonance when you sing.  - Don't be afraid to belt it out!  Once you've learned to breathe from your stomach, don't be afraid to push a lot of air through when you're singing high notes.  It will definitely help.|`|AA11305351	Practice early in the morning. Your voice is the most trainable then. Before long you will be reaching the "high" notes you desire.|`|319a3b8714a3933bafea64fe3de9e72aaa	KEEP PRACTICING ON IT YOU WILL GET IT SOONER OR LATER
3ebc0077a550e856ba7386d87d00e294aa	I am from Ames, Iowa.  Unfortunately I am not that fun!  I spend most of my time babysitting my GRANDCHILDREN>  Sorry.  I have two daughters and a cool daughter in law who are all in their 20's though.|`|a597a070ed5c224f55056de5e59e18b5aa	girls or women? i am not a girl but i like to have fun. what exactly are you looking for?
AA11793638	huh? I think you need to explain your question better!|`|2c183c2d09b432b388c4cf965cb75f2eaa	wats in that, u too can bcum someone's GF|`|d45d724bd93581c35f8cbf2d30087403aa	how do u define the word friend???????  otherwise if u have got feelings 4 the guy why dont u let out loud instead of cryin for him!!!!!!!
de8347232e6c50c17df876afc2a23b04aa	get some guts and call him again and tell him straight up how you feel. tell him that you can't sleep at night because you can't stop thinking about him. tell him all that comes to your mind. who knows that gf of his might be history by now. and you might be the one hes trying to get to notice him again|`|8e5c02e12bf72afc7e0ebd1f4ac098d7aa	You have to get the courage up to ring him and talk to him as it could be too late to do anything otherwise. If you do get to talk to him tell him every thing what has been happening as you need him back in your life. If things don't work out for the best it does get easier for you after a while|`|9cff697310e51c3f7e94f0fa3b543dadaa	Unfortunally u didn't mention u age. Let me tell u something. If a man cheated on u NOW. he will do it again. If u take it ones, u WILL HAVE to take it as many times as he wants to. Are u ready for that? if not..let me tell u something. THERE ARE TONS OF MAN out side...waiting for u. TAKE MY WORD. I KNOW THAT FOR SURE. Just think if u want to take this over and over again|`|1bb54ee06de68ba83558b8878f16f565aa	tell him how strong your feeling are and if he loves he will come back if he don't it time to move on|`|a168c374f521060c3c03d76e81dd201baa	call him and talk to him, but don't sound too desperate.|`|d4677f7f551d5ff9111a42248f3a5858aa	Yeah, sometimes, I get that too... I just think about the good times that my Ex & I had, and sometimes, I want him back, (even tho I KNOW that he's a cheater) And... I can't sleep well either, when I think about that...    But 4 you, I think you're really into this guy! So go talk 2 him, and find out if he still likes you. If he doesn't (and you wanna get over him), just think about the BAD times you had- like when you found out that he was cheating!     ANyways, good luck!!!     :)|`|AA12047862	u will habve to overcome these feelings...as for a sensitive girl like u i dont think that a guy like him deserves u....its better u try to be with friends or try dating some one els.....may be give ur self some time...and try to talk to ur best friend who can help u in forgetting him...but in my advice...pls do not call him again...as hes not worth it.|`|2f036ab7d84e3ebbd7a0b038af8cd8aeaa	ya if u love him just call him if he feels like u (true love)he must be yours . so pickup the phone he is waiting ring him up!!|`|bbc949c5da91284944168153007bea96aa	Am sorry for you . Be kind to I'm and try  to be friends  with  am.TAT WED WORK
5e8093548f3826e0007f5140c8f3d27baa	Don't feel bad at all and don't pay other peoples bills when you need the money yourself.  I found that out the hard way.  You are really sweet for wanting to help but you have to take care of yourself first.|`|AA10105344	you should not pay her bills ( you have your own )  You should not feel bad, it is your mony and you have the right to decide how to spend it.  No body has the right to blame you on that.  Go ahead with your own plans|`|a4cd9c44693d847a79f467c1c749d6abaa	This is what I do when people ask me for favors, 1)  what is the history of returning money and so forth and 2) would they do it for me?  A guy at work told me tha the needed 20 dollars to get some groceries and would repay me in a week.  I told him I would see how much I made and let him know if I could ( I am a server).  I asked around about what kind of person he is and everyone said that he is greedy, selfish and ungrateful, so no way did I let him borrow the money--I have two kids and diapers to buy!!!  My family comes first every time.  Good luck.|`|AA12083470	Uh, no.  Why is her lights going to be cut off?  Does she work?  Does she blow her money on things she does not need?  It is not your responsibility to take care of this person.  Yeah, it's okay to help someone out especially when you know they will repay you.  No you shouldn't feel bad.  She could get the money from family or your boyfriend.  Why doesn't he help?  He lives with her.  If your not careful, you will be used and the main one may be your boyfriend.
60e8c3233b8b42282c76eb50fcf8c16eaa	We are sound, a nice bunch! And...not many of us are red heads, that is a bit of a myth about Ireland...if you want red heads, I think you should go to france, apparently, they have the most redheads in Europe!    We are a bit of a mixbag, I'm blonde myself, and are lots of others. We come in all shapes and sizes, just like everywhere else in the world. Personality-wise though, you won't find better....we are funny and clever, we speak our minds....can be sharp-tongued...especially if you disrespect us. If you are a nice genuine guy (irish women HATE fake pretentious men) and you have respect for women...then you'll have no problem with us...but if you get on our bad side, we'll want nothing to do with you.    Nell.|`|621b095c310bea3ad89562af28e293abaa	Damocollier is from there.

2889b7708743bbca0b71792f90a65926aa	There seems to be something in the air today...and I wish I could identify it...as I never realized how alone we feel sometimes; until I was confronted with it by others.  I've always had this faith that all is as it should be...but I must acknowledge the longing I seem to encounter within many people.  Maybe it is so we will reach out to each other.      So, yes, you are probably having one of of those days...and it will pass.  Is there a way you can contact your friend?  It would probably make his day, too.  I think this might be a key to something better...and we are given these feelings for a reason.  I have days when I miss someone I haven't seen in a while, too...or you find them in your thoughts unexpectedly.  It is important to stay in touch with the people who mean something to you...or this might simply reflect something else that is going on in your life..."and this, too, shall pass."|`|4c0ab7882ba633fe7a99d6641061c428aa	sounds like you may be a stalker|`|1bb79883643f8d9470203e062a7bc21daa	Dan is a loser.  Find a different boyfriend.|`|4708d95edab134ea3887accf86cd0692aa	From Fond du Lac, Wisconsin?  Yeah, I know what you're going through.  I met this guy once that I'll never forget, even though we never dated or anything, just talked forever about life, love and family.  And I mean THE BEST conversations I've ever been a part of.  You said you've moved on, but there's no harm in thinking about someone that touched your life right?|`|d4330adbcc3a9025f77983a6a4f20f37aa	i know that  but i guss you love him
bdcf15dc94b684bffbf9cdf6607ae130aa	If you want a boy friend you need to tell yourself that you are going up there and talk to guys and from there you'll get to know them and if your lucky you'll find him soon.|`|ec1bedee52db791d688c2fc409a3c7a1aa	R U A     GUY?|`|65fd8a75b20633fa06183a41682852caaa	Just go out with friends and try not to look unapproachable.

Combien de fois on m'a dis que j'tais un coeur d'artichaud (pour pas dire lavette) en me voyant exprimer mes sentiments auprs de ma douce et tendre (qui veux prendre ses distances en ce moment).  5 ans que nous sommes ensemble et jamais je n'ai eu uniquement l'instinct "cul" ou eu de plan cul en priode creuse... Juste un sentiment indescriptible dans la poitrine quand je suis contre elle et le bien fou qu'elle me fait.    Donc plus sentimentaux, je dirais que oui, parfois les hommes le sont plus ou le montrent plus que leur partenaire.|`|f57878aa8c092376047915cfb2a072d1aa	tu veux rire? les hommes ne sont memepas un peu sentimentals|`|52e873edc80a2c787bed52e1f0f74326aa	Je ne le pense pas, ils le cachent tout simplement.....|`|f7bb5e03f94d6f279e45be2d406270feaa	Ils sont sentimenTAUX ;quand ils veulent ...|`|7ca5470766c2c1c6d6b30917c0fa1e31aa	Sentimentals non, peut tre sentimentaux, et encore ......|`|2ce9ac2cd42abc7eb50e0dac5b248bbeaa	c'est possible!!!mais dans ce cas l ils ne le montrent pas du tout.c'est peut tre parce-qu'ils cachent leur sentiments qu'ils sont plus sentimentaux.|`|d6fca24f047d7193341a9b9751cd4cd7aa	Pas le moindre du monde !

e0f9a9a6e7f485eb58bb2b235425d97faa	Is a mere "crush" worth defying your family over?  Racism is wrong, but when parents don't like an individual because of Race, it's usually because they're worried about their child, not because they're the actually racist.  Find out a little more about this guy and make sure he could your soulmate before you break family ties for a relationship.  In the end, you could wind up losing your man and losing your family.  Don't let your emotions rule all your thoughts in the process - try to think practically too - not easy when infatuations are in place.  In the long run if this man treats you well, he'll earn the respect of your parents.  Good luck.|`|1b793ca8852f421619c5e4e880e120eeaa	just sit down with you're mom and dad and tell them that you like this guy.But that hes' just alittle differnt.and that theres nothing wrong with him except his color.and when they ask what color he is just tell them the truth.good luck|`|AA12056721	Your parents wouldn't have a problem unless it was actually bad for you, remember they are not out to hurt you, they are there to help you.

I have had many, many guys who say they just wanna be friends. Truth is, they just wanted to be 'backup booty', or at times hittin it right then. And while I'm venting, if you know a woman is married and you claim you want to just be her friend please don't start talking about well do you wanna meet somewhere or maybe flirt a little? This is not being a friend. This is just a case of 'a little something that came up'. Same for females. (oh I didn't forget them) You get these girls that claim they are your man's 'friends'. But they're really just teases who want attention or that want the happiness that you have as a couple. Also known as the homewrecker. THESE are not friends.    I have seen people who have male friends (or vise versa) and it works out, and I'm happy for them. That underlying chemistry is not there to ruin things. However, this has not been my experience. Real friends are down for you no matter what because they only want what's best for you, not for them. =)|`|b70b1d1804185db3d744b1f9580e62c0aa	That is so not true. Most of my friends are female.

886ae7391e9d3d67fdab48522c707305aa	He can't be in love with you if he's being so disrespectful towards you - if he really loved you he'd be with you. I think you're right -- he just wants you to hang around as back-up in case things don't work out with his current girlfriend.    You deserve better, so put him behind you and find someone else who can be completely devoted to only you.

He is having problems with his woman because he is not giving his relationship the TIME or RESPECT it needs. YOU should respect yourself and tell HIM to respect you too. He must not think much of you if he expects you to see him on the side...you can do better and deserve  your own man ...not share someone elses.  IF you should start dating him will it be okay with YOU if he 'talks' to other women when you have problems (all relationships do now and than). Think this through. Good luck!

After that if you still want him then just come to him about it. Be yourself dont try more makeup or showing off your stuff the best you can just be yourself and if he doesnt like you for you then you dont need him like that. And about your friend dont worry about it if he likes you and not your friend then thats not your fault and you cant do anything about it.... just dont become all in your face about it to your friend.

AA11000025	They're contacts, not a car or something|`|2a15567c279249eba1fd60e6cb9ad41baa	If your cousins dad doesn't think she's responsible enough for contacts, then maybe she ought to prove she can be more responsible. Contacts are expensive, you got to include the cost of the yearly eye exam, actual contacts and the cleaning solution. This gets to be in the $300s...so maybe she should start being a bit more responsible by helping out around the house with chores and stuff. Also, if she's forgetful, she could actually hurt herself by leaving the contacts in over night or getting an infection. Glasses are better for the eyes anyways.  Hope this helps!|`|e615189c62a6205b3b54936f584762a7aa	It depends on the age of your cousin in whether they are considered responsible, if they are 11 or younger than no contacts would not be a good idea. If they have shown they can not take responsibility then the dad is right for not allowing it. Contacts is a huge responsibility because if you break them, lose them, or anything else the parent is out anywhere from $50-$500 and that is alot money to have to dish out again. But if your cousin is old enough and hasn't shown a reason for why they shouldn't be trusted then a few good websites for contacts is 1800contacts.com and acuvue.com. There is also many more sights you just have to search them. For glasses I would say search google.com you will be amazed on what you can find.|`|66f5ef2ae567e264895699fc8311ed8baa	This website gives you free traffic, it's free to join, you earn here free credit, with which you get free traffic to your website, http://www.trafficswarm.com/go.cgi?53747...   then there are other features, there are tools and other things that will help you with other things about your website, first 100 credits will activate your account, you will find out in the website how you get free credits,

I've spent the last two years pining over my ex boyfriend. We were together almost nine years and have a son together. Try not to spend so much time alone, it gives you way too much to think about.

I don't see anything wrong with it.|`|AA12275970	On my list of priorities, the boyfriend comes first. He should and can be a best friend. I'd prefer spending time with him over all others. Everyone should have the opportunity to have friends if they so choose, including the boyfriend. If this is what is desired by both, then make an agreement to the time given to each ones friends and keep to it. Reserve the remaining time for each other.|`|5a53787dc19c22c4ba6e927487b72561aa	no|`|fa360628718e43712df715f7220de1a8aa	The best friend should realize that you have someone special in your life and should be happy for you and learn to adjust to that.  The boyfriend needs to realize that every girl needs a best friend and needs to be able to spend time with her too...I guess through that babbling.. I think it can be done, if both "best" parties are willing to share you with other.    Just remember boyfriends come and go ( unless he's the one,lol) but your best friend will always be there!|`|916dae4544a5910de9c54d45ebe99697aa	For one, she chooses to spend time with whomever she wants and it is her choice to spend as much time as she wants. I really dont think the amount of time spent is that important either. I think its the quality of the time you spend. I know people who spend lots of time with their boyfriends and still make a little quality time with their friends and keep a good friendship. Yes balance can make things better but it is up to her to choose how and who she spends her time with. That doesnt mean she doesnt deserve a boyfriend and it doesnt mean she doesnt deserve a best friend either. It just means she has her way of dealing with both and you may not agree with it. You cant change what people do, its up to her to do that herself and make her decisions.  You can talk to her about how you feel but theres not much you can do to change her or the choices shes making.
1e66262e2ef399091d3ff08f8c8d60c0aa	yes single married or whatever just lookin for the GOOD stuff|`|b388c3ee1a0aa31321d15d2fd4d62ae1aa	Really you have a negative attitude.   Firstly it would be bad to be sucked in to doing anything   but makin the decision to do something is not being sucked in    Secondly dont be so selfish, relationships dont always work out. Its not always the womans fault nor is it the kids fault so why should they be treated like lesser people. Hypo--- You had a child to an ex girl and then every other girl around didn't want a bar of you because of that, wouldn't you be upset or at least a little pissed off.    I met a 17yo (1 was 19)girl with a 12mnth boy we now have a second together and i sometimes wonder what will happen when the boy who isn't mine gets older and finds out but hey i'll cross that bridge when i come to it and i'll be honest. we are now 21 and 19 and live a lovely family life.|`|b1ee8b7e9f82c6bb9881e1400b5a7252aa	I am a man who married a woman with a 2 year old daughter.  And I have no regrets. Its been 5 years.    She's not another man's kid... she's my kid.  Another man doesn't get to help her learn how to ride a bike.  Another man doesn't help her with her homework, or teach her how to write an email.  Another man does not talk to her about what it's like to be a good, honest, ethical person.  Another man doesn't hear her call him "daddy".     I get to do all that.      Besides the child support checks that are being garneshed from his paycheck is nice too.  haha.|`|44238d68d4b76a5d30950a1cbabffb4caa	It's a tough call. It really.. depends.

fe6f5b91b13167453d55847831a766c1aa	Good that you can cold convo with someone. I just make it a point to ask if she's single right off the bat, because both of us know what I'm up to when I start the conversation, so there's no reason to hold anything back. If she's got a boyfriend, say "Okay, nice to meet you," or whatever, and then move on to the next one. That's what I do.|`|AA12122449	One of the worse places to meet women is at a bar. They travel in packs, have their defenses up you have to not only impress her, but all of her friends. And, if youre lucky enough to break the ice, its not like shes going to leave with you because she came with all of her friends. If shes with a guy, the guy will act as her protector if hes not with hers o it can be tough. The best place to meet women is at wedding or other friendly social function. Weddings help put women in a happy and romantic mind-set, often they are there alone and can get caught up in the moment. They are more trusting of the men in the room because its likely the men are friends of the bride or groom. If you can be in a situation, like a friends cook-out, where you can approach someone casually and just get to know each other a little then you have a better chance of making a new friend and possible partner.    Just like you, girls can be uncomfortable in the singles scene. If they feel uncomfortable, then they are not going to be very open to any strangers approaching them with obvious intentions. If you really want to meet someone and have a relationship on the mind then here is my advice. First, if youre too desperate a woman will sense that and avoid you. They need to trust you and feel comfortable with you. You need to be subtle and gain their trust. Maybe you meet them one time and just introduce yourself But dont crowd them or talk too much. Just plant some seeds of friendship. The next time you see them they will feel a little more comfortable with you and you can talk a little longer, maybe exchange phone numbers. Maybe there is a way to invite her and her friends to a party some way to keep her feeling comfortable. Then maybe work up to an exclusive date and the first date should be casual so she doesnt feel pressured maybe coffee.  Also, women like a man that has it together (confident, successful, clean, easy to talk to) and can sense that about you. You need to relax and not have any expectations Its good to do the things you like to do in life and maybe youll find a woman that travels in the same circles and likes to do the same kind of activities.  Sex is easy and love is hard, but love is way more fulfilling and long lasting.     Good luck.|`|67ae4dbfb6e5c0d04d5150aa26283f9eaa	Should've specified that you just wanted females to answer in your question/subject thing. But seriously dude, any girl who already has a boyfriend and is in the same building that would decide then to forget him and go with you, is probably not worth it, because that means she's disloyal. (Of course if the guy is an *** then that's different)|`|AA11411832	Watch how the girl is interacting with the guys she is with. If she is tight with one of them. They may be dating. We sometimes go out with our guy friends as a safety net. That way we look unavailable so guys don't approach us, that way giving us a chance to scope things out and pick someone we are interested in. We even go so far as wearing wedding bands. Trust me sometimes has the opposite effect.   This makes it difficult for you guys to know, whether we are available or not. Best to stick to girls that are out with the girls. Or just scope out the situation. If they aren't kissing, holding hands or any PDA. Then take a chance. Asks her to dance. Good luck. We don't make it easy. Sorry.|`|36d2ca4fba6f3c1630809009b3fe2d8aaa	You sound like your trying to pick up girls in bars and that isn't the greatest place to be doing it. Your're way over thinking this. When your out and you see a girl you like if your polite and ask her if she's with anyone than you shouldn't get yourself into hot water even if she has a boyfriend. You need to be ready for anything. If she doesn't have a boyfriend than i'd advise you to give her your number and invite her out later if she's interested away from alot of people and the crazyiness of a bar. Take her some place fun and take her out to eat. DONT TRY TO BE WITH HER THAT NIGHT especially when drinking. It will show her you respect her.  Also try getting involved in clubs or sports or classes where you want to learn more about something you like to do. Than you'll meet someone with the same interests as you. If your always looking for it you'll never find it so relax and have fun and prepare your life for a relationship- but you need to have all your sh$t together first- GOOD LUCK!

It'll hurt her more to really fall for him before realising all of this..   And it'll also show her that you care - which we know you do|`|AA12083470	You can try, but most people have to find it out the hard way.  I was telling my niece for over a year that her guy friend was using her.  She was waiting around for him to get with her, but he never would.  He just led her on.

AA12122449	Jealousy is when you are being jealous which can mean envious or having feelings that are  bitter and unhappy because of anothers advantages, possessions, or luck.    Jealousy can mentally affect you... if you can't control your feelings it could cause someone to behave badly... it has caused many wars throughout history.    Best way to get rid of those feelings is to relax and take time to think about your ture feelings and about what is right and wrong. You should not hold someone else responsible for your own shortcomings. If someone has things you want, you will have to get your own. If there is one one thing, such as a woman, then its up to the woman to decide who she wants to be with and if its not you then forget about it and move on.|`|809b0d93bd72ece396303b621c9f9c23aa	Jealousy is the green face of death.

AA11311942	No, I don't think so. Lunch is a more casual meal and friends often go out to lunch, so it's a step towards your ultimate goal of asking said-person out. Dinner is a different story...

If youre a girl you may not know, but there is a lot of pressure between guys to do things like kiss and have sex. They want to keep up their image with their friends by fitting in, and by doing stuff like this which their friends appreciate them for (dont know why). A lot of this comes from boys' testosterone tho - since girls dont have it they cant experience the effects of it, but it seems to make guys a lot more hornier more often, so they want to do it. Dont slag them off or anything tho, they cant help it - its natural. And they DO still mean that youre pretty and they love you, its just they want to kiss you as well. you can do both. hope i answered your q ok.|`|ed77b684631a15604ec6d6ba1f0a55daaa	cos kissing is fun!!! so much passion in it.. and cos they dont have as stong feelings.. so to them it is just another one on the list!!!  but i love kisses they are amazing!!!!!  and so i dont see why they shudnt want to kiss ppl!

If they say something that's not what you want to hear, maybe you should look for someone that respects that you can't afford it and it's something you have easily adapted to.

When you feel that you have recovered from the break-up then you can be friends.  Right now you don't need your friend talking to you about his new gf or seeing him flirting with others.  Just tell him you need a little space and will let him know when you are ready to be friends.|`|44238d68d4b76a5d30950a1cbabffb4caa	It never works out.

It does seem like such a waste of time if you can't really find a way to connect with someone.  Most guys seem to be only interested in sex, the ones that aren't seem to be the other extreme, only interested in marriage.     The part I do enjoy about dating someone is when I'm out with my friends & my date joins us.  If he's cool & can hang, it's nice to have someone there, interested in me that my friends dig too.  It's just hard to hang on to those cool beginnings without getting too involved risk getting hurt or hurting them right?  It's just a matter of finding someone who lets you be you, enjoys similar things that you do & still gives you enough space...|`|8dba43a0f705c31c25250b9e02deea4eaa	The 'doing it' part, actually.|`|AA11545415	Jesus.|`|c1d6399a74f954c425f47690094e6d4faa	Having fun and getting to know different people|`|f3a2f4d3e96579a10270c1b80d898b77aa	getting off|`|ddb6c648ac289b64387ff2b09bf6bfd0aa	Hummmmmmm, mabe for the sex, wat du ya think ?

3ac016b22cd37333c86b0f2441c49d48aa	I feel for ya.  I have been there.  You just have to try to get her to understand that u have no interest in him that it is completely one sided.  If she's a true friend she will believe and trust you and understand u can't help someone liking you!|`|042fee1021e1f27c63a61f7a7d369c42aa	Well, if the situation were reversed and the guy you were interested in started going out with your friend, how would you feel?  Would you want to know from her, i.e. have her ask you if it's okay to date him (kinda awkward and it still would hurt)?  Or would you feel like you got stabbed in the back if she did go out and didn't tell you?    I think the best thing is to talk with your friend if her friendship means anything to you.  She may not be so receptive to you and lash out, but if you tell her your feelings then at least she knows where you stand, i.e. you still care about her friendship.  These kind of situations can destroy a friendship whether you're a guy or girl.    The other advice I can give is take it slow in dating situations especially in cases like yours.  When you're young (sounds like you are), you're still learning about relationships and experimenting with being attracted to certain types of people.  I remember having a crush on this girl and tried a whole bunch of things to get her.  She had other guys chasing her so had to fend them off, too.  But once I dated her the first time I realized she wasn't the right one for me.  It was a let down but it made me realize it takes time to find the right person.  The rest is the dating game and jungle out there.|`|ce325a9c545f6879425160654f269d47aa	you need to be straight up with her and tell her,you know i have no interest in him,i have no way of controlling what people think and you have a guy that is in love with you,tell her to put more energy in friendship not hate it takes more energy.If she is a true friend she will come around,i have been thru it to,Good Luck.|`|cb83b1e09db50cad5e753fbe899d1bf8aa	Depends what is more important....your friend or a guy.  The unwritten code is... do not date anyone your friend likes or use to date.  Even if they are an ex to your friend it will stir up nasty feelings for your friend.

AA11939205	men go thru stages of pregnancy right along with the wife/girlfriend. he may be doing that now with not wanting to hurt either you or the baby...not that this is possible unless you have really super heavy physical sex! I think you both may just have to take a long evening and discuss your issues, turn off the tv and radio...take the time to listen to each other and work it out.|`|AA10504495	Well ill tell ya, theres something wrong with him, to me there's nothing more sexy than a pregnant woman. The glow and appearance of her in this state. That would make me want to have sex that much more. i wont go into what makes me crazy about this, but ill tell ya, he doesnt know what he's missing. He may be worried about what this'll do to you and the baby. Its kind of a phase right now though i think. But if he cant do what you like then you can do it yourself to get by. Good question. Good luck!

Si dejaria de ser tu tio politico, pues que el titulo de tio politico existe cuando hay un matrimonio, una vez estan divorciados deja de ser tu tio politico pues ya no esta casado con tu tia.

Sentimento  algo que tem haver com amor. amizade, carinho.Se depois de 20 anos vc ainda n?o consegue sentir isso, ent?o n?o se culpe.Tem pessoas totalmente diferente de ns, sem afinidade alguma que devemos respeitar e tentar um convvio pacfico, mas sem hipocrisia.O importante  cada um respeitar a individualidade um do outro.  Se vc acha que um dia pode sentir remorso por isso, tente se aproximar e puxar um assunto que ele goste, pratique um esporte junto com ele, quem sabe se vc pedir a ajuda para alguma quest?o, mesmo sabendo a resposta, apenas para se aproximar... comece por vc a fazer diferente, pelo menos vc tentou, fez a sua parte.  Acho muito triste que pais n?o se dem com seus filhos, mas  se esse sentimento n?o brotou ,  porque tb n?o foi plantado.

314a709cb65619493d1273d6ac1c5787aa	Ja. Schuldgefhle sind eine sogenannte psychologische Abwehrreaktion. Sie tauchen besonders dann auf, wenn wir selbst berhaupt keine Macht und keinen Einfluss auf die Situation haben. Durch das Schuldgefhl versucht sich unser Ego - also wir selbst  - wenistens ein wenig "Einfluss" zu erschleichen.  Diese Reaktion tritt auch h?ufig bei Frauen, die Opfer von Vergewaltigung geworden sind, auf. Auch ihr "Ich" versucht auf diese Weise ein Stckchen Balance herzustellen.|`|1a84e504294ddc6a4eb095389ca3f723aa	Und was hast Du damit zu tun? Welche Aufgaben?    Ich wei? nicht, ob es normal ist, meine Eltern sind zum Glck noch zusammen nach fast 50 j?hriger Ehe (fehlen nur noch ein paar Wochen). Aber ich denke schon - besonders, wenn Eltern ihren Kindern nie versucht haben, klarzumachen, was der Grund fr die Trennung ist.    Ich finde das schlimm, das Kinder dann mit ihren ?ngsten und Befrchtungen alleine gelassen werden, m?glicherweise noch Streitereien mitbekommen.    Du brauchst Dich nicht schuldig zu fhlen. Und sprich mit Deinen Eltern. Sag ihnen, wie es Dir geht. Ich bin sicher, sie werden aus allen Wolken fallen und Dich ganz erstaunt angucken.    Nur so kannst Du jegliche Schuldgefhle, die unn?tig sind, abbauen. Und glaube ihnen, wenn sie Dir versichern, da? Du sicher nicht der Grund warst, da? sie sich getrennt haben.|`|e4af0c9d8285f0fafcdc513986fe959faa	ich denke du fhlst dich nicht schuldig eher traurig, weil dir etwas fehlt was du vermisst.|`|e8efe43801e6f03cb147b8687dae36b5aa	Es gibt Situationen zwischen Deinen Eltern,die sie gegen ber dir vieleicht nicht gewollt haben,weil sie dich wohl beide sehr lieb haben dadurch entsteht ein Druck fr euch alle,denn Du bist jemand in diesem Augenblick der genau in der mitte steht.Aber das Problem bist nicht Du,sondern Deine Eltern,denn jeder der beiden versucht seine Emotionen ohne den anderen partner los zu werden,da kommt es leider oft vor,da? sich beide Elternteile unabh?nging von einander,sich an dich klammern,weil sie Verlust?ngste haben.Das bleibt oft bei den Eltern selbst ,unbewu?t...Der druck Deiner Eltern unabgh?ngig von einander l?dt sich bei Dir ab.Auf einmal sind beide einsam und die Erwartungen an Dich erh?hen sich dadurch auch der Druck,da? Du das Problem w?rst,weil du diesen Erwartungen nicht nach kommen kannst.Aber bei einer Scheidung sind es immer beide die Schuld haben,aber gewi? nicht Du....da? mu? dir einfach klar sein,denn eines kann ich dir vieleicht empfelen,sprich mit beiden Teilen darber,ich kenne Deine Verh?ltnisse zu den einzelnen Parteien nicht,aber wenn zu beiden ein Vertrauensverh?ltnis besteht,dann teile ihnen mit,wie Du Dich fhlst.....gib Dich nicht auf....|`|73142be8e4a98f9b29d9f243a69e94efaa	Was fr Aufgaben?|`|3d1d0fa27327c60a880db43e11b3eef3aa	Es gibt leider viele Kinder die sich daran die Schuld geben.

Versuch das geschehene zu vergessen und versuche dein eigenes Leben zu leben.|`|27de0a37435f041ae3d6417353f06c88aa	Viele Kinder denken so. Sie meinen fr das Fehlverhalten ihrer Eltern zur Verantwortung gezogen zu werden, aber die Kinder k?nnen in den seltensten F?llen was dafr.  Die Eltern haben sich nichts mehr zu sagen, wollen ein neues Leben mit einem neuen Partner anfangen, und nehmen keine Rcksicht auf ihre Kinder. Die Angst hier ein Elternteil zu verlieren, und dann zu glauben man sei der Grund fr diese Zerwrfnisse macht vielen Kindern zu schaffen.  Bei einer Trennung leiden am Meisten die Kinder, und die haben auch die gr??ten Probleme damit, denn hier geht ein geliebter Mensch, entweder Vater oder Mutter, meistens der Vater.  Fhle dich blo? nicht schuldig, denn du kannst ganz bestimmt nichts dafr.

Maybe ask her out to a romantic dinner. If she still snubs you, then she might not be interested-and you can totally find someone better. Good Luck! :)|`|AA10891869	most likely she is shy because she already stated that shes love you. is she your girl?|`|223ecf462e8074397c0e432771c51aadaa	OMG i cant believe you didnt figure this out..  she's not the one who wrote the letter, somebody was probably playing a prank on you or her...|`|56f1670503712076d566abe0c72dfa28aa	try approaching her and asking her what's going on...if she still keeps doing that then she's just playing games w/you and is not worth your time...|`|456aeda7f07dc110857ebc590174ac2eaa	i have no idea talk to her about it|`|60aa7c0929f055f4a8e6dcb9ef95ad2aaa	it seems like she was just going through a thing like you know when she acts like she likes you but then she acts like you are not there.  task here why she sent the letter and then ask her if she still feels the same way.

AA10382554	There's nothing wrong with talking with him. It might give you a better glimpse if he has a crush on you, and see if the sudden handshake was the second indicator he likes you.     But if you already know Danny likes you (based on the staring, time together, and the handshake) striking up a conversation with him on the field trip might just completely win him over. And if you want to look out for his current girlfriend you might not want to do that. It might help you overcome your own want of him, if you put yourself in the other girls shoes, like the scenario were reversed.     It's up to you.  If he no longer has feelings for his current GF, there might not be anything you can do to prevent him from liking you more and not liking her.    I'd say talk with him on the field trip. Get a sense of who he is. And go from there.|`|f7c5fbe5dfe13ca6575121edca4f91a2aa	Maybe youre asking if you have a chance with him? I think he just wants to bone you.|`|AA12385463	First, if you like him, talk to him on the field trip and be more close friend, so you can understand him more.

If he loves his girlfriend genuinely, he wouldn't be hinting he likes you.     You should also watch out, because if he's considering replacing his current girlfriend for you, he'll turn around and do the same to you the next time your schedule changes or a prettier girl comes along.

88a8bd5fdcaf33dc319b30ce3e24ace1aa	Dreams pleasant or not are our minds way of coping and making sense of things that happen while we are awake, in our conscious or sub-conscious.  Every dream no matter how scary or pleasant has a significant meaning, especially if it is repeated over and over.  What you need to do is to keep a note book at the side of your bed and every morning try to remember then write down what you can.  Try to make sense of it yourself, if not you should try looking up your dreams by using dream books or the internet to understand the meanings.  Many dreams have symbols in that each have a different meaning and unless you work them out and make sense of them you'll keep having the same dream over and over. There is obviously something in life your not dealing with very well.  Hope you work this out.  Sweet dreams xxx|`|AA12268568	i did have nightmare when i was sleeping but not when i was awake|`|686474545d8ad5c6dd29b05f756a831daa	well i have never had one.

Have fun together. If she's completely turned off by it, I guess I'd talk to her about it. Try to figure out what her problem with it is and try to help her through it if she was willing.    If she was unwilling to discuss it or was completely rigid in her opinion, and could not even deal with the fact that I could watch it when she was not there, it would make me think twice about being with her.     It's not  a stupid question, but I find it interesting that watching sex has such a strong reaction for some people. If he liked a particular television show and you did not, would you force him not to watch it? Even when you were not home? Or if he liked a particular band and you did not, would you force him to stop listening to it? If there was an activity (other than watching porn) that especially turned him on to you, but you did not like that activity, would you make him stop?|`|34e36e6b5fd2af71486cab95b471fd59aa	Never is a long time.

6eefaeb3fe92b14d5b145ce96e098cfeaa	It sounds as if this friend doesn't want you to get close to this guy, and she's throwing wrenches into the mix (some you don't even know about).  If you want it to work out with him, you've got to get to him when she's not around.   I know you say you don't call guys, but that's the clearest way to get a picture about whether he's (and you're) really interested.  Call him and meet for lunch and talk.  If it is natural in the conversation, mention this "friend" and say that you don't know what or if she's been talking about you, but whatever she's saying isn't true.  Then don't bring it up again, just have fun with him.  If he calls you back, you two might have fun for a while.    Good Luck!|`|181e92a46d146ab8fc28063615bac2d1aa	Well I think your friend is a man hogger.. If she can't have him and he's not interested in her, she doesn't want you to have him either and she is not being fair so what I would do is not tell her anything about what's going on, if you go on a date with this guy, do your thing but don't let her discourage you, if she was truly geniune, she would try to help hook you up but she is a "hater" so give her some haterade and go get him girl! Good Luck!|`|86544820bed3303bb19b1cdea0f04f1daa	i give her props for caring but if she really cared she would want you to be happy just tell her you like him and for her to stop and if she dont i am sorry to say but ditch her and for heavens sake call him get your date you dont want to regret it please dont make a very common mistake and just go where your heart leads you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|1cd3b28e60d6d03362090f8b2c05d1e1aa	Sounds to me like your friend wants him and causing waves for you.  just pick up the phone and call, if you dont she will .....|`|AA11565637	Is your friend hurt you?don't make friends with her again.

Zuh?ren und Mitfhlen liegen manchem im Naturell, anderen nicht, aber letztere k?nnen dennoch gute Freunde sein.    Wichtig ist, da? Du Dich auf einen Menschen verlassen kannst... da? er auch dann neben Dir steht, wenn Dir das Wasser bis zum Hals geht.     Wichtig ist auch, da? dieser Mensch seine eigene Meinung vertritt, statt Dir nach dem Munde zu reden, und Dir gegebenenfalls einen Tritt in den Hintern verpa?t, wenn Du dabei bist, Mist zu bauen - Dir aber dann auch die Hilfe nicht verweigert, wenn es darum geht, entstandnen Schaden zu beheben.

Being in love come with getting hurt, feeling insecure at times n alot of other stuff. When u really love some one that much u tend to think that u might lose him. But if he is as nice n understanding as you say he is then maybe u should have more faith in him n yr relationship.  If you 2 love each other that much n if u understand each other, then stop worrying n enjoy what u have. If you are feeling like this talk to him abt it.

Aber sicherheitshalber lieber nicht anznden. Oben drauf kann man auch noch eine Platikfigur von einem Brautpaar stellen, wie bei einer echten Torte.  Dazu muss es auch irgendwo im Internet ein passendes Gedicht "die Hochzeitstorte" geben, hab mir aber nie die Mhe gemacht, das nachzurecherchieren.

Porm, uma vez que esteja estabelecida, serve como um slido alicerce que apoiar o relacionamento durante qualquer crise.A confian?a n?o vem de um comportamento perfeito; vem da responsabilidade. N?o se espera que algum seja perfeito, mas pode-se esperar que seja responsvel, que reconhe?a um erro. Confian?a significa que voc demonstrou que seu parceiro pode depender de voc, que voc tem integridade para agir corretamente mesmo quando ningum, exceto Deus, est assistindo.

AA10311803	I guess most people get caught up in telling lies sometimes to make themselves look better or more popular or whatever the case may be.  I personally have to honestly say that I have never lied to my friends about anything, only because I love them all and they love me back so we don't have to lie to each other to try to impress the other one.  We take the good with the good and the bad with the bad.  If something wonderful happens to one of us, the others are always just as happy as if it were happening to them........That is what real friendship is about.......in your case, don't tell her you lied if it is something that won't come out anyways, no need to get her mad or maybe lose the friendship as long as it isn't something that will hurt her.|`|42212720f400cc5ad4337bc00283b923aa	Well, I hope it wasn't something too outlandish that you would get found out about-But, yeah, I've done it.

I'm sure everyone has done something like this (I hope we're not the only ones!)...So she should give you a break!

6454d805ccbb78f88cd1ec406a637b71aa	Pas selon moi. D'autant que dans le monde d'aujourd'hui, on te demande d'etre de plus en plus mobile, et quand les 2 conjoints ont une carriere, il est parfois inevitable d'etre separe.    Je suis marie depuis 3 ans, et nous n'avons jamais vecu ensemble avec ma femme. J'etais d'abord a Paris et elle Bruxelles, je faisais 2 aller/retours par semaine en Thalys.    Depuis 8 mois, elle est toujours a Bruxelles et moi a Damas en Syrie, et je fais un aller retour en avion sur le week end toutes les 2 semaines.    Et a partir de fin Septembre, elle rentre au Liban, et on fera Damas/Beyrouth tous les week ends en voiture.    Nous avons choisi ce mode de vie, parce que nous sommes tous les 2 sur des boulots mobiles (elle est diplomate et je suis expatriable sans limites pour un grand groupe francais), et qu'elle a besoin de son boulot pour etre heureuse.    Ca ne nous a pas empeche d'avoir une petite fille tres heureuse qui a maintenant 15 mois.    Pour bien vivre ce genre de relation, ca te demande bien sur un bon budget voyages et telephone, ainsi qu'une reelle volonte que ca marche entre les 2 conjoints et une grande confiance l'un dans l'autre.    Et il faut aussi savoir etre sourd aux ragots des gens qui ont un mode de vie plus classique.    Et comme le disait St Exupery : "L'eloignement est a l'amour ce que le vent est au feu. Il eteint le petit et attise le grand."|`|726142200f47c37b2b152311e99f3089aa	Avec l'exprience, oui !

Einer der wichtigsten Grnde, warum M?nner (regelm??ig - also wenn ihnen danach zumute ist) weinen sollten, ist der "Reinigungseffekt".

Wir m?chten einen Mann, der auch mal weint und den wir dann tr?sten k?nnen.  Mal ehrlich....jemanden Trost zu schenken ist etwas besonderes. Egal ob von Mann zu Frau oder eben umgekehrt.

If you do end up marrying, think about how you are going to deal with bringing up your children- Islamic or Christian or both.  Talk about it.

40313f2c200d6f137c4e7a45ea385515aa	Franchement, moi je ne comprends pas tres bien...  Si tu aimes vraiment quelqu'un tu ne le quitte pas juste parce que toi tu voudrais tout de suite le mariage les enfants et tout le tintouin (enfin si c'est ca que tu appelles une relation serieuse, je n'en sais rien an fait!)  Si c'est LUI et pas un autre, tu patientes, tu attends qu'il soit pres et normalement ca marche...  Maintenant si tu le quittes ca veut plutot dire que en fait tu es prete a t'engager dans une relation serieuse et finalement peut importe avec qui?? Le premier qui est d'accord pour une relation serieuse remporte le pompon??    Peut etre que je n'ai rien compris, mais c'est mon sentiment...    J'ai une copine qui a fait ca, son mec n'etait pas pres a s'engager avec elle, pas pret a prendre un appart a 2 (ok, ca faisait 5 ans qu'ils etaient ensemble mais il est pas pret, il est pas pret, ca ne veut pas dire qu'il ne l'aime pas...) et donc elle l'a quitte... Lui il a respecte son choix a elle, et il n'a pas essayer de la "ratrapper". Je pense d'ailleurs qu'elle esperait qu'il allait faire ca... C'etait une sorte de chantage a 2 balles, on habite ensemble ou je te quitte.... Resultat elle a tout perdu!     Je crois que si tu aimes vraiment quelau'un tu as la patience de l'attendre... Sinon c'est que tu ne l'aimais pas vraiment et que le seul truc que tu veux c'est la securite du couple peu importe avec qui!    ;o)|`|853c6ba06140781f2615d18127f98f47aa	mais tu as bien fait il faut qu'une relation soit srieuse pour qu'elle dure on peut toujours en parler davantage si tu veux.    vasytof@hotmail.fr|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Tu lui a rendu service, et  toi aussi!|`|160a01638e1411a8a74da592ff9e8753aa	Je suppose alors que toi tu voulais une relation srieuse ?

Try to make at least one new friend in your class, to be your buddy for projects, homework, and to talk to. That way, class won't seem as lonely.     No, you don't have to make her/him your best friend nor do you have to be with them 24/7. Hang around with your other friends at lunch and recess (um.. you have one right?).

b18c8dacf80afee3a0606d55d8da2a32aa	Just be honest with him.  Tell him that you are not interested, and if he wants to continue being your friend he needs to understand.  You should notlose him as a friend because he is gay.  As long as he knows that you will never be interested in him that way, he should be ok.  If you decide to lose him as a friend, you might miss out on a great friendship.  Just think about it.

You seem to be caught in a unique situation. I've been advised that gays generally leave straight guys alone.    In a way, your situation is like any BGR when either the guy or girl tells the other one he likes her. It's pretty normal. Confess and hope for the best.    Your fren didn't make any unusual moves here. The fact you're both guys doesn't change this. So just talk to him reasonably and explain you like women instead of men. Think that should be sufficient for you both to remain just frens.|`|64d29cedfd383694090947900dcd4976aa	Try to avoid him in every way if he comes to  u tell him that u have some important problem rather than talking with him.|`|bc6332638018e9ffc0441242529e6c33aa	only livin the life naturally you are a normal men and this no is a trouble,be strong and be happy.|`|AA10603511	Well I think you should talk about this with him.

Second, if his your friend then nothing- race,religion, creed, gender, or personal preference should come in between that. If he like guys and you don't "so-what" as long as he's not hitting on you and doing anything to damage your friendship.    How about this, what if you had a friend you met on the phone. And you two shared great conversations for hours at end. and when you two finally met face 2 face that person says Wow I didn't know you were black - I don't like black people, we can't talk anymore - How would you feel?    A friend is a friend- Think about it! Askme922

Some days he is affectionate and other days he is 'touched out'.  I'm a very touchy snuggly person and he isn't.  But I know he loves me more than anything.  I think some people are just like.  What's not right is that yours gets an attitude with you when your not in the mood.  That's something that you 2 need to talk about.|`|2bab7047ef7c34f7d4027e5d8a7eff79aa	yes some guys can be like that. not alot but it happens. probably his up bringing. read tips on dating, love and relationships on this site|`|AA11707323	Its possible that he isn't the mushy type but not wanting you to touch him at times is not normal loving behavior.

I think it's kind of immature that sometimes he's not in the mood, but he's upset when you're not in the mood, but I don't think it means he doesn't love you.|`|2acd267375d5d5c7b8d9f0a241043e63aa	A lot of men are just like that!  Don't worry about it, if he loves you he will show it by treating you with respect and being good to you.  But if you want affection persist and if he cares about you he will give you some, even if you have to demand it!|`|88cf3ed4e1ae4a7bb5ac048579d4fc34aa	I'm kind of in the same situation.  I was raised in an affectionate family, we hugged, we told each other we loved each other, etc.  And I've been with my boyfriend for about 3 years.  He's just the opposite.  He doesn't hug, he doesn't kiss, he doesn't hold hands, or any of that stuff.  And when I tell him, he just says "Me too" or "Ditto", and it's because the word freaks him out.  He feels it, but he just is scared to death to say it.  Men typically aren't affectionate because they aren't raised to be emotional types.  So women are left feeling like we aren't being accepted, and we worry about it.   Don't worry!  You'll drive him away.  What I do with my boyfriend is when he's not paying attention, I grab his butt, or if we're sitting next to each other, I'll kiss him on the cheek.  I have to make the move, but he's not bothered by it.  He smiles, it's just not his thing.  If this guy reacts negatively to it, I would drop him immediately!  There's nothing wrong with a little affection every now and then, and he doesn't have to respond.  Take charge.  But don't expect him to make out with you in public or anything...  Good luck with it, hope it works out for you.  But SERIOUSLY - don't push it with him, he will think you are trying to change him, and will RUN.  Just try some simple things and judge his reactions (behind closed doors).....

Maintenant j'ai personnellement du mal  justifier une dpense aussi exorbitante pour un mariage. L'acte en lui mme n'a rien de mercantile, si l'amour se monnaie... Enfin, il me semble quand mme qu'envisager le divorce  l'heure du mariage est un peu trange, ou alors peut tre motiv par une incertitude quant au bien fond de ce mariage.   Maintenant il existe un moyen relativement pratique de divorcer tout en prservant chacune des parties. Le contrat de mariage sous le rgime de la sparation des biens rgle d'office tout question lie  la rpartition au moment de la sparation. Il n'empche pas la communaut. Autre avantage non ngligeable pour ceux qui ont l'esprit d'entreprise, il permet  l'un de s'engager dans une entreprise prive sans engager son conjoint, voir le notaire pour plus d'infos.

Tell him that you, like him, are moving on. Tell me that you dealt with the fact that he had previous girlfriends, and now that you (hopefully!) have found someone new. In no time you'll be best pals.|`|42212720f400cc5ad4337bc00283b923aa	If the breakup was so nasty, why do you give a crap how your ex feels? It's none of his business, and if he can't handle you dating other people,that's his problem! You shouldn't be so sensitive to his needs-you're not dating him anymore,remember? Don't worry so much about how he feels about it. If he had a gf during the 3 months it took you to recover, then he should be just fine. Talk to him or don't-But either way do what you like with the new guy.

The guy planning the date completely and it being a total surprise.    You know ... just basically being a gentleman for real.  Don't do it just for show or to get something in return.  We can see through that.  Just be real, be yourself and be a gentleman because you like her and respect her for who she is.    PS - it's ok to ask!

cf252ee563fd127943cba78bc449eb82aa	Since I was the cause of this question I will answer it as to why I said that.  Typically if a guy knows a girls ex it's because they are friends and in my books friendship is something that isn't broken.  Once trust is broken between friends its generally the end of their friendship.  I would want to make sure that my friend was over the relationship before I tried to date his ex. Hope that explains my answer.|`|99a475c0bc5f499b761c0babc5383945aa	b/c alot of guys conversate about the sex with the girl and how freaky she is and that sort of thing they may just want to wait til the stories die down|`|d89da7dbb31c1d7b55d3cdd50d2d0ad5aa	depends on how close a friend he is to you.when people break up there is always feeling still there.ooo i'm heard it all like i hate her .shes no good ect.hurt feeling coming out.if he is just a acquaintance ask her out . friend, ask him if its ok to ask her out. that away he can't get mad at you just himself.|`|3abdd48faae2c8d6b5056ede8dae4c2daa	There does not make a difference.

cd992bac6a371406f8ddce67868a6e05aa	Do you have some unfinished business with your old boyfriend. You may not be trying to rekindle anything but were there things that you need to tell or talk to him  him about before you parted,  or do you have any regrets. Your question was not ask about your current relationship so I am not going to make any comments about that. I will however tell you that is seems like there were thing left undone, maybe not by you but by him. If there were hard feelings between the two of you they need to be resolved before you can cleanly move on. Please notice how you feel in your dreams, and what is missing. I have had dreams where my wife is not there and I know that I am not with the right person and it feels completely wrong. I have had dreams where I am not married and in my dreams I know that something is missing from my life. Once you figure out what message is in your reoccurring dream you will be done with it.|`|fe6f707967cd575884d8563a78aca7f3aa	http://spirita.blogspot.com/
8383cb5f8e740ea6869df1ec316508c5aa	It is about sharing things and being loyal, about honesty and sacrifice.  Most of the "hot" babes I've ever been with were good at backstabbing and lying to make themselves look good at my expense.  I am tired of that and chicks like that are never going to be a part of my life again (although my current flame is quite cute but not conceited).|`|42752ab4ab20a3852a93491c98fdff11aa	For your question of: "if you are in love and it is not only based on looks, what is it really about?"     Oooh oooh I know I know!  Love is this:  Love is when you catch yourself many times throughout the day daydreaming about your man or woman  Love is when you go to the gas station to pay for gas and you see a little trinket and say to yourself "hmmm susy (or billy) would love to have this.  Love is when your mate tells you that he is down and sad.  You find yourself feeling down and sad too.  Love is when you walk down the street and a VERY good looking man or woman walks pass you and the only thing you notice is that the man or woman wears the same perfume or Cologne as your man or woman.  Love is when you think of your man or woman....you can't breathe because your heart feels as if it's about to burst.  Love is when no other man or woman will EVER faulter your relationship with your man or woman.  I can go on and on but, I don't have time.  My hubby and I have been married for two years now and it still feels as if we've just met yesterday.  Looks aren't everything.  Love is everything!|`|AA10369865	your an idiot.|`|b26c3b303d9d8dd72a33289045234d93aa	Nope!|`|e0ec05a4741eeac3a8237546bc6dfd4faa	people shouldnt marry each other because they like the way that person looks by their side it wont last,, dont get me wrong it helps and of course you should be attracted to your partner. but marriage is about wanting to share and spend the rest of your life with a certian person because you love who they are outside and INSIDE. you should marry someone who has the same interests and goals in life as you do.    besides eventually everyone gets old and UGLY|`|553a517c8da568e732818b870d9e9527aa	Personality trumps pretty every time.    An incredibly hot woman with a lousy personality, quickly becomes unattractive. Sometimes they can become downright ugly.    By the same token, an average woman will become more attractive as you get to know her, enjoy her personality and eventually be gorgeous in your eyes as you learn to love her.|`|6bfcc04c29708e87ac5687096b222866aa	???????????????????|`|9ccb580a4a121218293ebf7002b231b6aa	Being in love is about how you feel about a person, not what they look like.

I am way more confident with  women than when I was in my 20's, and the swing in ages that are appropriate is fantastic.  You can date from 21 to 40 with no problem.  Don't be so pessimistic.  It's a great time.  The 20 somethings want more mature guys, and the 40 somethings are in the mood for a young guy.  Feast on this opportunity, my man!|`|AA12363383	honestly, I see alot of guys your age around. Maybe you don't beacause you go to try and hook up which they are already are.

Or rather start not looking. I'm 34 and I've had 3 relationships since I was 30 (including one I'm still in) and none of them are with someone I met in a bar or club. One was with a girl who worked for the same organisation - although she didn't work with me, which might have made life complicated. The other two were both friends of friends. My main piece of advice to you - stop hunting for the right person, cultivate your other friends and acquaintances (especially the ones with lots of friends you haven't met yet), get them to introduce you to their friends (not just the attractive ones), then, if you get one with their friends, start socialising with them too, and get them to introduce you to their friends. Build up a bigger social network, with more opportunities for meeting people, and, of course, be ready for potentially meeting the right person at any point in time. And above all never - NEVER - give off the vibe that you're desperate. It is totally counter-productive.    Best of luck!|`|123d181514d15fecf89674e4291ad8daaa	I'm in my mid-30's and single... seriously stay away from the clubs, they are like meat markets, and the girls way too young, drunk and silly.

752a57b483fbdca1b05d3c06a0822c6eaa	I think Bella has provided an exhaustive reply....|`|AA10382554	My friend recently blogged about good sex from females perspective.     Men, FOREPLAY IS A MUST!    Men enjoy and need foreplay as much as the women; it is vital for a body-tingling climax.    Men - tease your lady, touch her - skin is sensitive to touch and a gentle sweep of the hand across the neck or cheek of your lady will get the game off to a good start.  Kissing is so VITAL!  Kiss her gently on the lips while gently sliding your hands up and over her body to her face.  Then cup her face in your hands and kiss her again before going for the full french kiss.  Kiss her cheek kissing down to her neck and across her chest, moving to her breasts.  Then kiss back up towards her lips again, throwing in the occasional slight lick from your tongue.  Don't get rough unless she tells you to.  Undress her carefully, feeling across her body, instinctively letting her know which item of clothing is coming off next.      MOOD AND ENVIROMENT:- It's so very important... candles and low soft lighting are great.  Mood lighting helps relax her and feel more open and at ease with the whole thing... believe it or not but the right kind of enviroment can set a sexy, alluring, erotic mood without even touching yet.    MASSAGE:- Massage her back in up and down, circular motions, all across her back, her legs and her inner thigh - but don't touch her private parts yet, tease her that you could put your hand there but don't actually do it yet - don't forget to rub her neck and WHY ONLY DO HER BACK?  Massage her front too... her thighs, hips, belly and breasts... A front massage is unbelievable for turning people on.  Occasionally lick, nibble and/or suck her nipples.  At this point I am 99.9% sure that she will guide your hands to more...intermate places...     FINGERS:- Use them... first one finger, then two but never anymore than four....unless fisting is your and her thing.    TAKE YOUR TIME:- Too many times men rush and spoil the feeling...be considerate and slow things down.  Teasing is the thing to do... tease her body about the things you are going to do... you will find that your lady will WANT YOU MORE and take the lead in getting it.  This makes it more grattifying for the both of you.  Tease her with your hard-on; start by just putting the tip in and teasing her lips (not the lips on her face) with the tip.  When you do actually go for the full penetration do it slow, then take it all out and do the tip-teasing again.  FOR THOSE GUYS WHO DONT LIKE "GOING DOWN" this is a fair-enough alternative..however there is no substitute for some good head!   Then, after the teasing, you can resume "normal *******" as some of you guys would say.    When you have done and both of you (and I hope both of you) have climaxed - if you done this right guys your lady will have orgasmed more than once - DON'T JUST ROLL OVER AND GO TO SLEEP! Cuddle her for a while, hold her, kiss her some more.    AND REMEMBER:- A good indication that you're doing it right will be her moaning and groaning.... these sounds are the signals that say "you're hitting the spot" And if you need to practice any of this   well... you got my number...hehe...xxx    P.S. CLEAN SHEETS! Don't forget them... cheesy sheets are an instant turn off...!|`|AA11591251	everything related to sex turns me on n on n on...|`|69e7c6276be421b3f87e83d9b6b433c7aa	every thing because exploration keeps the relationship together|`|AA11668094	When its not all about you...Put the womans pleasures  first.

932d5a6f59d070d52d0a61af3c7466afaa	There is no set time for matters of the heart.  Some people get married quickyly and live happily, others are miserable.  Some people wait years and end up miserable and others are ecstatic    I think you are unsure, having doubts and that is why you are asking this question.  If there is something in your heart that says no, maybe you should say no until you are sure.  If you are still confused about things, find a counsellor to talk to, to help sort out   your feelings    Good luck!|`|98aa4e21dbd86f761d9b8809f2ec65edaa	Yea, well it seems long enough to me!!

Do small things that make your partner happy, just because you like them. Most couples have a silly tradition - like kissing each other before going to work everyday. Space is also important people need to be able to do their own thing and see their own friends - then they are happy to come back into the couple.|`|5db1ecdba3d6ae84acaaa775a2f8b44daa	Listening- the forgotten art of relationships.    No matter what kind of relationship, people miss the cues and things said to them that help that relationship work better. Proves true in work and personal relationships.    People get wrapped up with their own ideas of what the other person expects, needs or wants and sometimes their own agendas.|`|68ff1af77f94708f6557674d7a84b9dbaa	Communicate.  Communication (or lack thereof) is the single biggest reason that things don't work out in a relationship.  Sharing thoughts, feelings, motives, even hashing things out keeps both people on the same page.  No matter how much you love or care for someone, you can't read his mind and he can't read yours.  Lack of communication leads to game-playing and dis-satisfaction, and other freak outs.  Talk.  That's the most important thing.|`|ff841749180342e912b29c90c76b6bc2aa	Well first there has to be love ( in a marriage ) or interest ( in a dating relationship {newer relationship}) then there has to be     communication - without this no relationship can survive    passion - each partner has to share a passion for one another which leads to a great sexual relationship between the two of them.    trust - without trust you simply can not have a relationship that will last    compromise - you will have to compromise in any relationship and if both of you are not willing to compromise for each other then you will have alot of arguing which could then lead to physical abuse - emotional abuse - etc..     relationships are a 100% man - 100% woman continously working on things 100% of the time    these are the biggest things to make a relationship last and be a healthy one.

It must be short, specific, simple and cute.  Maybe just saying like "...I like you..." and your name is enough and a chocolate always helps. Wish you luck with that letter.

Then, as they are growing up they are taught how bad males are and they should stay clear of them etc. etc.  I use to tell my boys that because they were born with a penis, they are cursed for the rest of their lives. Now my twins sons are 41 and now they know why I said it as they have found it to be true!    Then girls develop their love for penis and they over ride some of their teachings!

I always buy some big stuff and then fill his stocking with a bunch of little stupid stuff that he needs or would think is cute.  Like.....poker chips, body spray, car freshener, love coupons, etc.

Start talking to more and more people and hopefully you'll find some people you have stuff in common with.|`|AA11317014	There must be some other girls, cleaners, cooks. What about in the local shop or service station?|`|AA12141673	hmm it depends on what you have round there to start looking from.. drive around a ittle bit and where you see alot of chicks you stop and go into if not just go to different places around town.. try myspace.. lol myspace does everything.. just go on there and tell them you just moved there and your looking for freinds to hangout with ..you can even browse for them yourself just enter what yourlooking for it it will show everone in that town that has a myspace (which is probably everyone..)
AA10684042	Honey you don't need to be hurt. This is not something you need then. Call him back again and this time tell him that is it over because you need to happy.

854cb48ba206b67dd3aa91b1da9b615baa	You can't make him get over you, but you can make sure that you aren't doing anything that encourages him not to.  Spending time and hanging out together may be confusing him or impairing his ability to move on.  A complete break from spending time together, even if it means you have to pass on a few outings with friends for a few months, is probably the healthiest thing to do in this situation.|`|b14aebcaf59329ca8781b7e1cc7de7dcaa	stop spending time together in any capacity.|`|AA11615026	sorry dear this is a tough situation... I have been in it and was pretty miserable too infact it was just like this except I as the male     was the one who was trying to get over my ex and we were friends and she was the one that broke up with me.    as I look back all I really wanted was for her to be honest with me and tell me that she was ready to date other people and didn't see me in that way becuase we were over... she showed me that that was the way she felt but she never told me and that is why I kept the whole friend thing going on with her and she totally knew that I wasn't over her and I guess just wanted me to get over her.    I am now and I don't hate her but in order for that to happen our circle of friends had to change and I do not talk to her anymore at all.  that is what it took and I know that if I started hanging out with her again I would fall for her all over again which is why I can't even be friends with her!  she knows how I feel and we have taken appropriate precausions.. anyway I guess my point is tell him its over tell him that you love him but don't want to be with him bla bla it will probably break his heart however it could be worse.... don't let yourself be miserable because of someone else's needs and desires|`|515c6e245859ce6d7c6a52565aa72a32aa	ignore him or bring some friend whom he can meet|`|aa2c58d57ae7153375ef7cca1a448e8daa	He may still want you but don't let it get to your head. You can't really make anyone do anything. He's going to have to figure that out for himself, it will hurt him getting over you but that's one lesson in life that he must go through. Life isn't always as smooth as we would like it to be.|`|1dac77dc134627822fff3d768cc56f57aa	FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DO ANYTHING!

Just be sure your not giving him mixed signals.|`|AA11753383	show him that you've moved on with your life. once he sees that you've moved on with your life, he would want to do the same with his and move on with his life. unless you want to make it clear to him that nothing can happen between the two of you other than friendship.

AA11094078	If your husband came home right now and asked you to put on your sexiest dress and heels for dinner in one hour, would you?  Yes or no ?  Or would you have an excuse.  Sounds like to me that you would have an excuse.  When we have excuses, we tend to live the life that we want in our head  (day dreaming) which then makes our real life look boring.  Get out of your head, find a babysitter, or accept the fact that you all have accepted the rule not to leave your child with anyone yet and think of other things to do even if they have to be separate so that you can have some time alone at the library, movie, or a Friends house.    Life, parenting, and marriage takes work, forgiveness, and the willfulness to learn from your mistakes.|`|AA12100644	Have your mom babysit your baby once a week so you guys can go out and have a date night - many couples do it and it works wonders!!|`|c0e46b36cf027cc8291a5c2ead064543aa	Yes, it is normal...but you have to learn to enjoy your life together, just the two of you...it will take some sacrifices, like leaving you baby with someone you trust (thousands of couples do that), but you need time as a couple, without kids to remember the things you used to do when you weren't parents, it is healthy and will be great for your marriage. Your baby will be ok, and your relationship with your husband will be even better.   Have you talked to him about this? you should, probably he thinks the same way|`|a086a4aed31a4b3c8bd4503205b21b1caa	Spice up your life with your husband, find a sitter and you'll discover married life is what you've always dreamed of :)|`|7536f0b5a8404a73ec57aa6fd7769c93aa	Very normal.  Once a week you and him need to find an hour just for yourselves.  Keep the fights clean and the sex dirty.|`|2649545d60c2f207605e91bb0aa43c06aa	Anything good is hard work- Have a date night with your husband, tell him that one night a week, you two are taking the kids to your parents, or whom ever, and go out- have a ball, act like you 17 again. If you can't get a sitter, then when the little one is sleeping, slip on something sexy and some great wine, and have a nice evening,,, you are what you make of your relationship!!!|`|63650481ad643008583be3816c0e1ef0aa	Try doing something new together! Take up a hobby you both can enjoy, like taking walks with the baby in a stroller, start a memory book, play video games together, learn how to cook new things, redecorate a room... The possiblities are endless!    If you miss the way things were, you should arrange a bi/weekly date night. Leave the baby with a sitter or realitive and spend the day/evening doing something just the two of you would enjoy. Visit places you used to go (like the first date location), see a concert/play you always wanted to see, anything you want!    Hope things look up for you!|`|f72d75861a6220b4137b0c603b64e4fbaa	Yes this is normal.... You both should set up a night for the two of you and make certain to keep to the schedule. If anyone calls or trys to schedule something that day let them know that that day/night is already booked. Grandma's and aunties can babysit while you two go to the movies, bowling, shopping, walking at the beach, candlelight dinner, romantic picnics, go to a get-away place, jacuzzi, etc. things you enjoyed before you got married and before your daughter. This will enhance your marriage life and make you each enjoy your lives. Kids take up a lot of time but you both will have to make time for each other. Good Luck and Best Wishes

Four years later nothing has changed. I don't know, I love him dearly but I need more. Hope you can get the same.   Life is such a strange thing. Sometimes I don't get it at all.  Good Luck sweetie, hope everything works out for you.

She almost killed off all that we had and for a sweaty discusting spaniard. I love her to death but then sometimes we'll talk and while she's still in my head I think back to how she had her lips on his discusting face and threw me away for those moments. and how she gave herself to somone else and it just makes me mad. so well be talking later and Ill get mad and she wonders why, and she always gets mad at me for telling her but whenever i dont she just doesnt mind that much. so ur bf is probably just trying not to tell you somthing because your special to him and even though you did something stupid and anyone else would have left you to rot he loves you and wants you and doesnt want to tell you whats making him mad|`|9e88083569dcda0014470c8e3c83a55faa	Wake up and smell the coffee.He got what he wanted.

You can be upset that she didn't call , but not to the extent that you where.   I think  you should call your cousin and have a talk with her and apologize and all so apologize to your teacher.|`|cbe314de5d69dac2ef626d7f89cb6d47aa	I think you're over reacting because she didn't call you.

So what? she would call when it better or might later, but that is not an excuse to shout at everybody.|`|0edb2fb079e73818d1ebef4c7a844d8eaa	tell your cousin how it annoyed you and how your not ignoring her your just feel let down by her. maybe give it some time and then you can be good friends again when time passes.    no you werent REALLY wrong, you were just stressed out.    learn from your mistakes, if the first man gave up after he burnt himself when making the first fire  where would we all be now?|`|075b2a62530a57a2af58c96172d98e77aa	Your not making it too clear about who was you wrong to but if I understand right ur mad at ur teacher for asking you to pay attention and mad at ur cousin for not returning your call. Well first off just put urself in ur teachers position, if it was you trying to teach a person something and while you was talking to them they blow you off while ur talking and start to chat with someone else not listening to you at all then when you ask them to listen to you and they yell at you and tell you to mind your business how would it feel? Its ur job to pay attention to ur teacher and its ur teachers job to teach you, she's just doing her job and it must be frustrating to her knowing she is trying to do what shes there for and u turn around and yell at her your probably not the only student she gets in a day that does that to her so just be a little more thoughtful plus she didnt do anything wrong it was rude of u to start another conversation while she was talking.And I bet you'll listen to her if you ever needed her help with something, right? Now as far as ur cousin, sometimes people are tired or busy and cant call you or answer your call, I'm sure that has happend to you before when someone is trying to get a hold of u but can't. It dont mean she just dont want to talk maybe she just couldnt and even if she didnt want to talk from the sounds of it u and ur cousin talk and see eachother alot and are close its okay not to want to talk on the phone sometimes dont be so possesive.

All you ever need is love,  communication and understanding. That's what I figured out so  far. If you are down, you need to get up and start doing something with  your life. Don't need to be shy, be straight forward and allways say what  you want and expect from the others.    =======  If you have the time, and you are looking for someone, complete this simple  form and start dating.  http://**************/go.php

You have been pregnant and a mother as long as you have been married, so it seems that you and your husband have had little to no time to get to know each other (been there, done that..  Married 10 years now).  I found that a little 'alone' time, after the kiddos go to bed, with us talking and as my daughter or 9 1/2 puts "Mommy and Daddy things", has worked wonders.  Even if one of us are not in the mood, so to speak, we still talk.  About our day, thoughts, worries, and fears. and other things.  I believe that we have lasted this long because we do not keep secrets and we do talk to each other.. When you talk, you could find out that neither one of you knew something about the other that could spice up that marriage.....:)  Good luck in this.|`|AA11610088	watch some porn,bring some toys, do it in random places be creative|`|aafeb6bfda32502a2368dd003b971469aa	did u have a normal birth or c-section did u gain to much weight either way it shouldnt matter he should love you no matter what i have 2 boys 3 yrs and 7 mths my first was early 2 mths he weight 2lb and 12in i only gained 20lb and i was normally 135lb and with the second one i was normal exacpt i had a c-section 4 both kids i was after the first loosing alot of weight went all the way down to 108lb then i got pregnant with my second gained hella weight ended up 170lb and now around my 140lb :( but i try to loose it its hard but my hubby says he doesnt care he loves me no matter what i look like he says he made me that way lol that im beautiful no matter what and thats sweet but i dont feel that way but in ur case i dont really know whats going on so maybe u should try to dress sexier if not lost ur baby fat do some exterise no affence b more loving and what the hell does he mean hes not satisfied with what u do? do u even know what ur doing wrong? ask talk to him let it all out|`|b0bf561a07abe3b5d4eb778a2270bfbbaa	Every marriage goes through this.

Ask him what you can do to spice up the room! When things got a little repetitive in bed with my fiance' I put up signs all over the house when he got home one night! All the kids were gone and it was just us! So I made him go on kind of a scavenger hunt and every clue led to a new toy or gift( a blind fold, flashlight and that glow-n-the dark body paint) so when he got to our bedroom finally there was a note on the door that said before you enter the room put on your blind fold. so when he came in I led him to the bed, sat him down and started to undress him ( all the lights were off, it was pitch black) and then I teased him a bit. I then turned on this really sexy song and removed his blind fold and handed him the flashlight and I did a dance for him! this really helps because he focus the flashlight on what part of your body he really likes to see move and you'll know exactly what to do! Finally I took him to our bathroom and told him to bring the paint I let him paint me anyway he wanted and I told him to put certain colors in the places he wants to touch first! Depending on what kind of man you have you may want to speed things up for him because mine was trying to hump me like a little dog in heat the whole time, but he really enjoyed the fact that I took the time to think of this whole "game" and actually carried it out til the end!! Try something exciting like that if you have a hard time getting an answer out of him!!!  Good luck and Have a Pleasant Night!! :)

Liebst Du zwei Menschen in einer Partnerschaft aufrichtig, bedeutet das, dass Du diese Zwei ber Dein Gefhlsleben informiert hast.  Ein offenes Gespr?ch drfte daher alle Probleme aus dem Weg r?umen. Es kann zwar schmerzhaft werden - fr wen auch immer - aber die Ehrlichkeit sollte oberste Priorit?t besitzen.|`|0d88392b05082c1b02e7429ab0e0672faa	Klar meinen Sohn, Freund , Eltern.......|`|b386dab6baf3d3c2680a31be7cff82b3aa	ja, natuerlich, im besten fall sind es dein kind und der ehemann....aber ich denke mal so meinst du es nicht. kann man leider wirklich, und am besten waere es beiide wissen voneinander... sie muessen sich ja nicht unbedingt kennenlernen... l.g.

By arguing that "18 and under" should not be allowed to have sex imples there is a set age when sex suddenly becomes "ok".  Sex isn't based on age and I would hate to see our society where we say something like "oh hey we're 21 lets go have sex" by setting the age it's more like creating the behavior.  Sex should be with someone you love and trust and who feels the equal (ideally your spouse...) and by setting an age limit it hurts the very principle.  In another view making mistakes and getting your heart broken by sex teaches you a lot and I believe it would be a mistake to take away a young person's free will even for the greater good.  Good question.|`|32f48ab0216e5d9dd249d8e976b61a9caa	can you actually forcefully stop teens from having sex before they turn 18 can you|`|71c6530097630d5739ff357a542114c1aa	I think not.|`|AA10800231	ok. how old r u. i am 14 and i dont even want ot think about that|`|37abab6a69ae65f2942ba119d6e787d4aa	what do you want to...|`|271be723954db02cf627996e6a7bd803aa	I would think so|`|0065cf9cef259863c96cf3f8a7697e3aaa	Hell yeah shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit I would|`|d888364a81462da1d57820f6382f0a14aa	I dont' think so  they might regret it later|`|e8ddfeef3b93c17076ab7360e9065104aa	16 is the age of consent in the uk!|`|1c28a089bbd3029ee128fe01d35b800daa	i think being at 18 only allows u to vote!  sex should be at the age when u feel u are ready for it.  dont be in hurry to take that!|`|13ce3bf1c3f8b7d54cdbc88b826663faaa	Like the law would ever stop them? Just like it stops them from getting beer or drugs?|`|1e8719073bb18499a60396a19a1116e4aa	I think we'd all be in a world of hurt if the government tried to start regulating our sexual activity.  If the individuals involved are aware of the possible consequences (pregnancy, STDs, especially HIV) and prepared to deal with whatever could happen, it's their decision.      Did I have sex as a teen?  Yup.  Do I want my kids to do it?  Nope, but I keep the lines of communication open and answer questions honestly whenever they arise.|`|AA12066368	as long as they do it safely and smartly, yes.|`|a0ec6d3c39b0cd679fbe174773b43552aa	I THINK SO ...............|`|AA11116434	Fine by me as long as it is consentual between similarly aged teens and they are using condoms and they aren't having babies and getting on the dole.|`|AA10107922	um.... NO!!!|`|5bc4b0a493abc6df01a693ab2fbd7008aa	well they can...more or less, if u are both between 16-18 then its legal...wether or not she gets preggers or if she files rape, well then ur screwed if either of those happen|`|9766819076abc99d7efc68969d218400aa	A complex question this one might appear to others... but the answer is just simple: If you feel like you're ready to face the succeedings of having sex before turning 18, then go for it!    This world of ours has gradually become liberal through time. Each and everyone of us is being granted the freedom to explore (only on some things, though). Laws, bills, decrees, acts, etc. are just being established to regulate our level and extents of exploration, as well as to teach us what is right and what is wrong, and to show us the differences among lacking, enough, and too much. So if there would be any laws that would regulate the legal age of participating into sexual encounters (or maybe almost anything prevalent in this liberated world), do you think those could stop mankind?
89f2fe7f927abab62dac3e95466f8008aa	in order to get over someone is to remain as friend....|`|AA11160104	It's about the maturity of both of you and the reason your relationship ended.  I am actually best friends with my ex, but our relationship ended only because we live far apart.  My other ex I'm still friends with, but there are times where he will bring up our relationship because he still thinks we have a chance, when I've made it clear we were over for a number of reasons (which I'll refrain from sharing) and it irritates me because of how many times I've had to tell him.|`|4a6d4f2c9f3f69c0c4da78e3a9b82c7faa	I wouldnt talk about the problems,but the memories|`|5f11be0f85526c4555ee2e7e0bd603ceaa	I think that your ex may still have some feeling for you left over from you past relationship.  I don't blame you for wanting to talk about your past together, it's inevetable.  If she truly doesn't like talking about your past together, then just try to talk about something else.  Good luck.|`|5c09c7705d1637d6554efa2c9b886f46aa	maybe she misses what she had!|`|0cfef240b04301a8beaaef29344d4ad3aa	This happens because she got over you as a lover but can value you as a friend.  It's easy for some people to seperate these two things.  Talking about past relationship problems is uncomfortable because it is part of the past.  I think it's great that you two can still talk and be good friends.  I know it must be hard for you because you miss her and the relationship you had.  But being there as a friend is more valuable at this moment to your ex than anything else.
947abe0b75bdf8d52f89e278de8ed371aa	Same happened to me with this guy, he kept starin at me, and then I started likin him and he stopped. And then I found out he has a girlfriend.....    Why don't you sit near her again? or do you have assigned seats? (forgot assigned seats even existed.....) yeah I go to college where they don't exist.    Just have someone ask her if she likes you, and that'll clear everything up.|`|a65171b6d8fbb95f9fa2490c17f10f1baa	she probably stopped because u didn't pay any attention to her maybe ,  try   again and see what happens   u never know until u try  gl|`|a3828d0fa73510de1d79220d67dce2e9aa	well she probably did like you but you she didn't like the way you were showing her you liked her too so she moved maybe she thought you didn't like so ya did you talk to her?|`|f3cb8b3f5cbd8e2a5faacbec398bf60eaa	just try to talk to her ok TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11901881	maybe she play hard to get ( i don't think so ) or she just don't attract to you   it's the best way to found out , go to her when she's alone and speak with her about anything you found intersting (in that time & condition), after that ask to take her out for dinner or etc   it's the easiest way & fastest , just try don't be shy  & look at her eyes with smile during conversation.  if you are really shy , i recomand to you , stay in front of mirror imagin when you talking with her in worst situation and start talking with mirror , hopefully it help you  sorry for my bad english  gl|`|874037fb007c78df565c8e371bdc76b7aa	Take a chance.

Your hormones are at its peek.  But after a while, that dies down. If it doesnt,then more power to ya. But make sure your partner wants the same and is not just doing it to make you happy. If your partner doesnt want sex, and you go somewhere else to get it, then thats a problem.

I left home not soon after highschool because my mother was so controlling of my life, just be patient most of the time they are actually looking out for you.  You may not believe it at the time but looking back I wouldnt have gotten in so much trouble and gotten into situations that I did if I had just listened to my parents, and abided by their wishes.

99b27e3897c6eef022d357ffc2d3da1aaa	No you HAVE to tell her that you are sorry but you do not have feelings for her! MAKE it very very very clear, or she might still stick around "hoping" that "someday you will love her". I had this happen before with a guy and I didn't want to hurt him, and I believe that when it was all said and done I ended up hurting him more by "trying to let him down easy" I should have told him straight up from the get go that I was not and would never be interested. SAVES EVERYONE ALOT OF PROBLEMS! But BTW you can still BE NICE about it, JUST BE TO THE POINT ALSO! good luck.|`|5f5d2d9a6e48d3966bbfc9cb495d99daaa	you should tell her that you don't feel anything more than friendship, as soon as possible. don't give her false hopes. she might be hoping that you feel the same thing for her. tell her directly that you just want to be friends with her, nothing more. but of course, expect that she's going to be heartbroken and some changes in your friendship. don't be surprise about those changes.    good luck.|`|AA11778516	just stay friends but dont have too much contact....|`|c13ac612b71b1bb1ea284ecf68b317c4aa	Just talk to her as kind as you can, no matter what you say its going to hurt her.|`|205f03e5772ce1ca7e18c981809ff5aaaa	the earlier you tell her the better, cause if you keep dragging it she will grow fonder if you and the more hurt she will be.|`|42357623442381dde6952989aa57d92caa	This is a portion what I think is the initial point of loving someone is: first try to fix what is broken if you can't ask yourself Who do feel  this with?   It is about two hearts beating as one. It is about feeling like you have known someone for a long time when you just meet and click. When you both have so much in common and you complete one another sentences. You would not hesitate to do anything for that person and they for you. When your mind wanders off thoughts of that person invade your thinking, you eat sleep and carry that person with you always when he/she is not around physically. You can talk to one another about anything and when that person is hurting you feel their pain. Sacrifices are made and when you do things for that person, it is done from the heart and not throwed in the person's face to remind them of all you have done. There is no physical, verbal or emotional abuse and when their is a dissagreement because there will be for all couples, you put your pride aside to work it out. Loving that person is effortless and does not drain your energy and the making up is the best part. When you make love there is so much chemistry that you don't have to pretend and you want to be there with that person and when you look into their eyes, that is all the turn on you will ever need and their voice becomes the music that soothes your soul enabling you to come together in a passionate embrace followed by an explosion of pleasure that surpasses any intimacy you have ever experienced.    I hope this helps.

Try sex. Men are usually docile after sex. Just a qwikie, nothing romantic, just your basic Discovery Channel type of thing. If you are into fellatio, this is perfect. Believe me it will be reciprocated. Your boyfriend has alot of pent up emotions, if you want him to talk about it instead of throwing tantrums, first you have to relax him. This will work, if it doesn't, he's either gay or stupid!

10bcacc8a9454ff178013417967c5677aa	Deep down in the mind it would. If someone had gotten married, and they were both virgins, it would make the first time amazing. Nothing to compare to, no bad memories, no STD's, no worries. Someone I know once said to a people who were ridiculing him on being a virgin, but he replied "I can always be like you, but you can never be like me again."  But not being one isn't a horrible thing at all. Yes, if love was in the equation, then who cares if they're not, just be wary of their morals and temper. And I mean LOVE, not feelings, strong like. Love is: to provide and protect. Nurturing into maturity. That's what love is.|`|AA10782876	Of course. I would not want to be with an inexperienced man.|`|AA11592311	Virginity does not make any difference whatsoever in this day and age.

You didn't say your age so I would understand if you were a teenager and saying this.|`|a8a662e7463750914a9ddc122025f632aa	in the grand scheme of things it shouldn't matter if you are or are not a virgin. it should matter if you and the other person have good chemistry together and if you get along otherwise.|`|168d000f37abea7500f96c1518e860faaa	Nope I believe saving yourself for marriage.|`|AA12341574	you have to test drive a car before you buy it don't you|`|c5154af69218a24a2032e6f64bdd72b8aa	yep|`|09e27190dc5f5889c37d77bf7d67753caa	When I was younger I thought that way. I think that once someone is in their 20s they are responsible enough to have intercourse as long as they use protection and they KNOW the person and LIKE the person and that person is not involved with somebody else. Nowadays, most people are not virgins when they marry. It is socially acceptable...but someone who is young (under 20) and has had a child or children is usually looked down upon, so be responsbile and wait until you are mature and find someone who you respect and repects you. Don't be in any hurry.|`|f6255d2cbd04d31b791d43d1bc5d324caa	Nope, it doesn't turn me away. But the fact that they are lying about it does turn me away.|`|602b29325828f6791e626f2d363db953aa	I would't think that it would effect a relationship later on down the road, but I personally would not want to be with someone who has had multiple partners.  You would not want to get something that ajax would not wash off.     I would marry someone if they were not a virgin, but both should have testing done to know for sure. Better safe then sorry.

The biggest one of all he mentions other girls or worst u see him w/one aww if u see these signs end it quick lol :-) hope this helped take care.|`|15b231dfa259f51f4ddef2deaa1faa41aa	One of the most common is accusing you of cheating.  Others can be things like not wanting to touch you, not talking, acting like he's not with anyone while in public.  I'm talking from experience as men the single worst most idiotic thing we can do is cheat on the women we're in relationships with.  Not only do we feel horrible about what we've done, it totally destroys the feelings of the woman that we're supposed to be in a relationship with.  The look on a woman's face when they find out about it is the worst nightmare you can imagine.  The feeling you get after you see their expression over what you've done is worse than any pain & suffering that a man who has done this can understand.  So if you're in a relationship remember it is definitely not worth it to cheat on the one you love.|`|8255179bf9630191a4532f97cdacdefcaa	Well, let's determine what cheating is?  Do we own each other?  Do we want someone nobody else wants.  This is an area that carries so many consequences with it.  It breaks down everything, trust, honesty, loyalty, respect, resentments just about everything.  A person has to have a strong constitution to deal with it.  Hurt and anger play a big role in relationships.  We are supposed to forgive each other 490 times.  If you really love some one sometimes you have too.  Question is do they want to?  If they do and they really want to try to remain with each other by all means try.  If one does and the other doesn't, do what you have to do.  Somebody will always go after something that you love and they see that is good.  Set yourself some boundaries and work within them and let your significant other know what they are.  Men are not as strong as women are and they are easily manipulated.  It is not all their fault either.  There is always some desperate woman with low self esteem who has nothing to bring to the table but good sex that helps compound the problem.  It makes them feel powerful to destroy someone else's relationship.  Men need to learn how to say No.  Is it worth it just to jeopardize everything for a stint in pleasure?|`|f29028f8295b41337fd6d17a00b77e09aa	hehehe!!!!!!!!!  cheating.....  my past boyfriend is a perfect cheater.

I'm 20 yrs old and my sister die on those esctasy pills. I still to this day hold my self responsibly for not letting someone be aware of what she was doing. some things are okay not to let ur parents know about like pot or sex, but escasty is so dangerous that even ur first time taking it you can died. don't hold that back from your mom and you need to tell her, though ur sister will hate u for the moment in the end u can wind up saving her life|`|1H56FPt8aa	I think you should tell your sister you are worried & you should tell your parents. You sister is going to be mad at you but isn't that better than having her hurt herself and you carry the guilt forever?|`|XadcGNGnaa	Tell you mum and talk to your sister. Well done for not just turning a blind eye. It is dangerous what your sister is doing and you need to get help, no matter what your sister says to you. Why would she want her heart to go slower? Your sister probably thinks she's being cool so you and your mum need to help her   Good luck :)|`|u8wNo13faa	oh you poor thing, this must be a really hard situation to be in. you seem pretty sensible, i think that you should talk to you sister, tell her how worried you are, and tell her to tell your mum herself. tell her that if she dosent then you will cause you are really worried. dont take any threats off your sister, this is her health we are talking about and you dont want to risk that do you? if she wont tell your mum then as hard as it will be you should tell her, telling your mum could be (in the long run) saving your sisters life.  look at it this way there is two outcomes: 1.you dont tell your mum and if something happened to your sister you would never forgive yourself...and you and the rest of your family will be really upset for the rest of your lives. 2. you do tell you your mum, the problem gets dealt with...your sister may get mad at you and not talk to you for a wile...but she will eventually get over it and things will go back to normal... witch outcome do you prefer?  i hope this helps, and i hope that everything wil work out ok.  good luck hunnie x x x x x x x|`|WDs4fRoxaa	I would definitely tell my parents. I would not  let her risk her life because she wants to be  cool in front of her friends.    She needs to stay out of the clubs.    Instead of telling directly, just tell your mom  that you did a paper on kids who do drugs at  those clubs.    Your mom will take the hint and start paying  more attention to whether your sister is using  illegal substances.    Your sister is not going to risk admitting it to you  again. She is already afraid that you are going to  tell from the last time.    Best wishes|`|jNQbVDHSaa	tell tell tell! your sis might hate you but you might save her life.|`|BZ8Rlp9uaa	You should tell your sister about the course-work you did, and how dangerous taking these pills could be. Also, tell her that you really don't like what she is doing. If I was you I would threaten to tell my parents if she didn't stop, and actually go to tell them if she doesn't pay any attention to you.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Do you have a good relationship with your mother ... then have a talk about the things you have learned..and suggest "Mom" check with the other parents with whom you sister has told her she was spending the night ... get the Mom to compare stories and dates...so it looks like you didn't spill the beans.    Or ... just do what you feel is best.....Just know that what ever you do .. there will be cause and effect.     You can't toss a stone in the water with out making a few waves.    Is your sister worth making the waves .... That's the question you have to answer.|`|AA11297232	I would talk to my sister and i would make it clear that i worry about her , i would discuss the dangers of taking drugs and that it could lead to stronger drugs etc etc. Make it clear to her that you are going to tell your mom and do so. She will be upset and cross with you but what would you prefer, seeing her in a wooden box or have her alive and kicking. If you tell her that you are telling your mom if will be upfront and not behind her back so she won't be able to accuse you of back-biting.

L4z1FI5Kaa	If you are in the UK, there is a system in place whereby the mother of a child can register that she is "willing to be found", so it may be that you birth mother is waiting for you to contact her.  You may not be able to find your biological father  You need to have your original Birth Certificate and, as the previous contributor suggests, the way through the maze is via Social Services because you have to have Counselling (a Fostering and Adoptions SW) before any information is released.  If your adoption went through Social Services then your original records should still be viable.  You may have a local Area Office where you can call in and speak firstly with a Duty Officer, or you may have to contact your County Council Offices and ask for a Social Services Department referral.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Start with your birth certificate--it should have the names of your biological parents on it, or at least your mother's.      Were you adopted through an agency?  They may have records if your biological parents said that it's ok to contact them.    If both of those avenues fail, you may have to hire a private investigator or lawyer to look further into the issue for you.|`|AA11567932	Speak to Social Services and ask for information, that would be my first port of call sweetheart|`|0E6u2YOGaa	It's much easier than it was even a few years ago.    Get hold of your birth certificate and contact...    http://www.adoptionsearchreunion.org.uk    They are extremely helpful and understanding.|`|yU7urgLxaa	Ask me when you are 18.|`|3Bfgpqxjaa	maybe asking your adoptive parents then if you are still not happy ring your local social services and ask there you could also try your local newspaper and internet to see if you can get anywhere but social services should have records and so should your local births deaths and marriages officer if its only your birth cert thats a start cause a name and area is really helpfull as then it narrows down your search but askyour adoptive family lots of questions dont be scared to ask they have being waiting for this day for a while and wont be hurt and upset that you want to find out about your real parents if anything they should support you and guide you because they love you and your happiness is everything and also you are extra special to them.  or you could go to the doctor- DNA test. however there are many websites to help.|`|JyDIhe7Taa	DO u know the names of your parents??  One way of doing this is to look at the General Register Office Records to see if your mother ever married if she wasn't married at the time of your birth. You can do this either through Ancestry online or Ancestry UK or 1837 online.    You could look at old electoral registers for the area she lived in or subscribe to eroll online (UK) and search under her name. The problem is she may have married and changed her name.    I would be inclined to advise you to get a good, reputable family history researcher to help you - you'll see them advertised in Family History Magazines or search online for Family History researchers for the area you think she may have lived in .    Who brought your parents up? Can you ask them to tell you everything they know about your family?  Good Luck and I hope you find something helpful here.

All you can do is tell her how you feel about it and try to be as non threatening as possible. Just be supportive. My boyfriend got addicted and I was so upset. I learned that I could not tell him how I felt about it in an angry way. He just shut down and wouldn't listen to me. Once I became more understanding and supportive, he began to listen.

Quitting smoking was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, and I thought I wasn't addicted!    Here's what I tried before finding success: hypnosis, those fake cigaretts, the nicotine patch, and group therapy....none worked.    I finally tried this HERBAL patch I bought 6 months ago on the net. They claim a 97% success rate. Well, it worked! They had a sweet deal which was a free 10 day trial for only $3.95 including shipping (it's regularly $53 for 10 days)!!    I don't know if they still have that deal, but it's worth a try.    http://www.alllsite.info/stop-smoking-fr...

You cant make someone do something they dont want to, but you can help them to understand how you feel. And if she does decide to quit, then for everyday she goes with out it(pardon the expresssion) you should give her a treat. you know something that is worth it to get over the addiction. Hey, it worked for me.

Since you are not friends, it will be easier for you to let her know; but be subtle.  Realize, she already "senses" he's not truly all that into her, unless she is very niaeve, and or very needy.  You could allow her to "overhear" you talking to another girl (you'll need someone else to help)  while you are saying:  "It think he is a creep the way he says ugly things about the girl he's dating".  That way, she'll hear it, but not blame you for coming to her with you tale.

4b0a709da4e0ca46677111434fe8fb02aa	Since the money for the house is coming from "...a legal issue where my MOTHER sued a company...", I'd say that the money that was awarded to YOU, really belongs to your mother.    If you don't want to live in a house with them, then you need to talk to them about what your plans are.  You can't, however, expect them to offer any financial assistance in you obtaining an apartment.  If they do, then you should consider this a bonus.  I'd suggest opening up to them and telling them this information sooner, rather than later, as you moving to NY may put a crimp in their plans to buy a house.|`|d23aca13370978e420b62a034a5c1c41aa	i think you have to talk with mom and dad.  there's nothing to be scared of.  you are 23 years old and have the right to do what makes you happy.  this is your future you are talking about.  but, i feel that you should set mom and dad up in a house with some of the settlement money.  after all, if all they are the one's that initiated the law suit for you to be awarded this money.  tell them you will help them to find their dream home - but, not to look for one so big, that would put you into a position of having to live with them.  all, they need for you is an extra bedroom with bath for when you visit, which will be often tell them; but, at this point of your life, you need to go out on your own and find YOUR dream.  save your portion of the settlement, make this money grow for you, get your apartment in NYC and pursue your goal - if you don't, you'll wind up resenting your parents and, even, yourself. good luck. i hope you follow your dream.|`|AA11778516	well theres an alternative....if you can afford a small apartment for them then you can get your own home too...talk to them about it hun, i am sure you'll come up with some solution..maybe buy them a small bungalo with a nice little garden, then you can look for your own place for yourself...i think they will understand that you want to stand on your own two feet...you seem like a sensible young man..just suggest it to them before actually going out and buying the place....|`|6647952d4657a09da6bceaa5238a5d12aa	Give them some time...

Not sure I understand how...if it was awarded years ago...that you have to wait???  Been in a law suit situation before...and have never seen a result like this!

0e4349765171ecbe23de53ba35097c00aa	what are you a jew or something???    i give my lady everything , expect the same    what is wrong with you to insult her like that???|`|d26bdbd805c770116fde94c6ee58529eaa	You need to take the money and open up a bank account with only your name on it.  Do not put her name on it and do not allow her access to the account.  As for the $300, you might just have to take the hit on that one.  You drank the beer too and unless she is willing to pay it back to you, I'm afraid you are out of luck.  If you had the money in a bank already, I would change accounts.  She needs to learn how to manage money and this will be the first step.  Do not give her money and tell her she has to survive on what she earns.    GOOD LUCK!!|`|647985942b1d1879191c13a53d35c624aa	Hey! put your money in the bank from now on. It doesn't matter if it's just $20.00, go right down there and make a deposit, and DON'T put her name on it. Before to long you will see how quick that money adds up. You know what, you need to have a good talk with this young lady, first of all if she can't manage her own money, then she sure is not going to help you manage yours. This is something to be concerned about, if she's been dishonest about this money, what else is she doing, that you don't know about. This is just food for thought............Oh! by the way, maybe you should show her some of the answers you got here today.    Hugs  Texas girl|`|cb37ad055cd37a8224fc5a8d6768f9aeaa	sorry hun buy ur gonna have to find a better hiding place oveously she cant be trusted with the money or knowing where its at. And if she asked you why she cant know where its at tell her cos u want it to stay where it at and not go to buying beer and gas.|`|e9b9655b5b4d14607a378bf6fe74a4b0aa	I would talk to her about it. Just tell her that you don't appreciate her actions and her lying about it. If she responds as though you were the bad person then it may be time to call it quits. However if she used the money on you as well it's not really that big of a crime the only real problem is that she hid it from you. Hopefully you can tell her how you feel and develop a better spending regimen together...but sometimes people will never value a dollar!  Good Luck!    Jen|`|0e0ab93015f1a7333ee0326bf6ee8a96aa	?????????????????? shorter!!! i can't read that long!|`|AA11965485	first thing, change where u have the money so she cant get to it anymore. then tell her u want the money she took back. you probably wont get it but you are letting her know how serious you are. then just think about your future with her. she already lies to you and she doesn't watch her money and she blows what she gets and now she steals from you. getting the picture. break up and find a real woman.|`|560ffb031c9a1d045b2a4a1257412e72aa	Is the love you have for her worth the fight. Talk to her about it then take the rest and put it in the bank where most people do and don't let the chance of that happen again. You realize it is just as much your fault as hers. So make it so only you can be to blame for the loss of any of the Truck money! Good luck.|`|73e39f739a65d29d44b9e0af7bc4aa2baa	Find a better place to save and continue saving to get what you want if you love the lady.|`|904fec720de23b1085923b69f39ed40baa	If you can't trust her , put the money where she can't get to it !|`|a1dd820fb4f7a967392d966f07fe8893aa	Why wasn't the money put into a bank's savings account to draw interest until you needed it?  She couldn't have taken it if you were the only one on the account.  Open one now to save for the truck without her getting it.    That said, if you have proof she took it, tell her to pay it back.  Put her on an allowance, if you feel she deserves any money.  If she spends it all, too bad.  Don't bring home any more cash unless you want to lose it.  If she continues to take your money, etc., dump her and chalk it up to experience.    Find a different kind of girl who won't rip you off and one you can marry to make your relationship legal.  I suggest you try a church house where the Bible is taught and you won't go wrong.|`|06fefb7b36912ba207bc22e94341adfdaa	hide your money somewhere else and break up with her because it is your  dream to buy a truck and she is ruining your dream...
d798708b9d2be5423a6ef244a557f301aa	What you need to do -- for YOURSELF -- and never mind all the "friends" and third parties muddying the water for you, at school or elsewhere  --  is come to terms with the fact that the fantasy you invented about your relationship with this guy is not the truth.  Only then will you have the strength to move on.    Fantasy:  He is the only one who understands you and really knows you.    Fact:  He spreads nasty rumors and says mean things that hurt you.    Fantasy:  He  is the only one who's really right for you    Fact:  The world is full of interesting guys, most of whom you haven't met yet    Fantasy:  It will all be okay again if only you can make him understand.    Fact:  It was never okay to begin with, or it wouldn't have fallen apart.      You can make up your own lists like this.  I would suggest making a list just like the one above, side by side, comparing fantasy (what you so much want it to be) with fact (what is real).  It may hurt a little, but it's one of the best methods I know of for adjusting your point of view and moving on.      Only you can find the strength to do this -- nobody can give it to you.  So get a pen and a notebook (or open a new document on your computer) and get busy!  Good luck to you!|`|AA11313325	Well why don't you get back at him like he's doing to you. Why don't you start a rumor about him. Something like Hey did you know that he will always leaves you and goes and plays with little boys maybe he's a pervert. Or tell him that you were so hot one day and he couldn't get it up must be a gay thing. But make it big and make it hurt liek he's doing you.|`|21240bb18b2c3d2006ab81e4ebe5d391aa	We all have the same problems when a relationship breaks up.  It takes time and yes it hurts, but in the long run if there is more negative than positive about the relationship then you are better off.  As for his negativitiy you have to realise that he is hurting too.  Do not treat negativity with mor negativity or it will come back on you.  Ignore him and leave it go. You deserve better.  As for the x she was/is jealous so just ignore her too.  She was not a friend to begin with.  Jeanette sounds like a very kind dear friend take her advice and move on. you don't need it.  Take care Heather|`|8Z5RRe20aa	this guy sounds like a BIG JERK! I think the reason you are not moving on is b?c you might of had a long history together. Guys do this all the time. They drive you crazy so you will be crazy for them and one day when you finally move on he'll come running back. just dont try to get back at him that will make you no better than him.|`|174d7b4673a7b4a8f10a9f241b4fad6caa	Go to his best friend. Thats what I did. Oh and shes not your bff if she take his side.|`|xz2dvsCJaa	you get over this by getting rid of all of them supposible friends you have and you see the reality of your situation which is that he is a LOSER and you know that you are worth far more then that.. ''you'' need to come first here and when you put ''you'' a head of him and all of his stupid games with all of the enemies you'll see that it is really just in your mind and nothing for you to really be concerned of...

ca04fb4375fb954bbfca701c7977cda7aa	1. Either tell your friends how much you like this girl, and see if    she can, or will help you break the ice with this gal.  Us ladies love playing cupid.    2.  When you all meet, make sure this girl KNOWS how HAPPY you are to see her.  Start talking to her about people and places you both know. This will break the ice, and show her that you REALLY missed her over the years. After the movie, invite her for a milkshake or a get together to reminisce either now or soon. Make sure you get her cell no, or give her yours.  Then make your next move by SMSing her for a get together.  Easy Peesie!    3.  Say nothing, do nothing, and maybe miss out on something great.

I know other people are reading this so, I hav something to say:    for anyone who like a guy/girl and wants to somehow let him/her know, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY! TALK TO HIM/HER! What are you going to do cartwheels around him/her? How about do the peacock dance? Why don't you wear Christmas lights? that will get his/her attention! IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE JUST GO TALK TO THEM! Sheesh, like a bunch of scared kids.|`|9ac7b4db89f8dabbbf35544a8ab2b9b4aa	dont try to hard may be he likes u just the way u are or jus tell him|`|9c531a21c17f098fb3f82a520b5209faaa	Sounds like he may already be noticing you!  If your looking to get noticed further, you have a couple of options: go to him or let him come to you, whichever suits your personality.  If you approach him, you might discuss any common interests you're aware of.  If you let him come to you, hopefully you don't have to wait too long! If he nibbles on your bait, I would be sure to make lots of eye contact and smile.  Your body language, more than what you might say, will speak louder than words.    I think the other thing to keep in mind is that friends are notorious for being too nice.  I don't know your friend, but I would caution her telling you he's "always staring at you".  I'm not trying to create undo conflict, but sometimes friends say things to encourage us to go for the gold! Trust YOUR gut and you'll be fine. Good luck!

If you let him off with acting like a complete jerk about this once he will do it again and will walk all over you were you feelings/needs/wants are concerned.    Show him that if he doesn't change then he has lost the best thing that could possbily happen to him.  A relationship is a 2 way thing, you have to give and take, compromise on a few things, take each others feeling/needs/wants into consideration and work on it, if he's not willing to do any of that and "loose the rag" any time you try to talk to him about how you're feeling say BYE BYE.

c0f6bd3b726b4f3a16f21d6f8759e7abaa	I know exactly where you are coming from, I'm 20 now married and no kids in college. When i was 14 I broke my virginity my mom couldn't trust me anymore. I had to regain her trust back by trusting that she will trust me and understand where I was coming from. by  doing she started slowly letting my bf come over because she figure that if she let them come over I wouldnt have the urge to sneak and do things. She was right. I would suggest that you ask her and be up front with and be like mama, Can I go by such and such, explain to her How you haven't seen him and such and You know she have a trust issue with you because of your past and that you are awared of the consequences and mistakes you have made. By doing that you are giving her the sense of comfort  that you have learn from your mistakes that she can trust you and that you know and she know she have a problem with trust issues. You have to be up front with her no matter what. Also by doing this you are opening up to her and trusting her judgement. If she doesn't agree don't sneak and do it. Trust, it will be not work it sneaking., It's kinda hard for a mother to open let her daughter do things after she finds out about the virginity thing. She will try to keep you latch inside, and if you find her to do that, let her know upfront that her trying to keep you close in will only make you wanna sneak and do things and you guys have to come to a conclusion of your free time when you are not around her. It will be best if you invite him over and ask your mom can he come over or meet up somewhere, that way she will be more prone to letting you do it. You have to have her in the mindset that you are trying to be open with her and you guys can have a open friendship where you can talk to her about anything and everything.|`|HT3LtMtaaa	Tell her every thing you just posted about him like the fact that he has a girlfriend now and you just want to catch up

Si podemos aceptar nuestras diferencias y hacer todo lo posible para superar los aspectos de nosotros mismos que pueden lastimar a otros, el reencuentro es posible. Pero si no compartimos los mismos valores, y cada uno lleva agua para su molino, quedan dos caminos (malos para m), la hipocresa de llamar para las fiestas o la indiferencia.  En pocas palabras creo que cuesta reconciliarse, porque cuesta mirar para adentro, ser autocrticos y hacer el esfuerzo por cambiar. Siempre es ms cmodo que el equivocado sea el otro.

It tells me that she desires me.  When she starts things up, I tend to be more involved and it's much more intense for both of us.  I never feel like less of a man when my gf starts the lovemaking.|`|32b14766b9f8a3874a8fd6939ed6a357aa	Grab the shifter and lets go.

Otherwise you could very well not really be interested in him - you just like that fact that he likes you and pays attention to you. These could be different.

Spend more time w/ him alone and maybe that will help you out.|`|AA10799113	I think you are attracted to him.

I think the only conversation you should be having with her is wants she wants out of your friendship, friends are meant to be there for one another when it comes to either one being in a relationship, not go in a huff, stop talking or loose it completely when you mention another girls name.    You are only friends, what right does she have to stop you from talking about your other female friends?, things will get a lot worse if you were to take things further.

Your just thinking those things because that's what society tells people is important these days.  Know what?  They are wrong.  I have the same feelings sometimes and I find the best thing to do is realize that someone who makes mistakes learns more from life than someone who's led the way to do things because making mistakes means your learning on your own.  Noone does everything right all the time.  Life is a long road of learning experiences.  I like to think of it like that because it sounds like a good adventure, if that makes sense to anyone else.  So go right a head and be who you are, don't let gossip and fear of failure change you into someone you won't be happy with.

Crossed them in the hall, they were peeing in the Ice machine, thought they were in the mens room....very very bad behavior.

AA10636677	A true gentle man!!! I dear say, U have some way of handleing a situation, good job. I know how you feel about situations like this, I'm the same when it comes to needing a friend and not a bf/. I set my feeling aside for that same reason, she needed a friend. well... the best thing I can say is that keeping it aside isn't gonna make it better. it's gonna wanna explode, you'll have to tell her these things. Feelings you feel about another can be hidden, however there are emotions that can't be handled. Just be her friend when she needs a friend. You'll be fine with your feelings now right? well I'd wait a little more tell all her problems blow away. She wouldn't want to deal with you and her ex boyfriend issues. keep on your gentle man ways to her, it'll soon get to her to asking you one day, why would you be such a great guy to me after all this? she'll soon figure out that she might even have hidden feelings about you after all? who knows?

Tell her again that your feelings for her are the same as they were and ask her if she has any feelings for you.  If she does then your dreams come true and you can stop waiting around and pining for her.  If she doesn't then you need to move on or you will always be her fallback guy.  It's never good for someone who cares deeply for someone else to be forced to the back burner or "just friends" territory.  You just waste your time and emotions on someone who will never be able to return your love or take it seriously enough to at least start dating.  Anyway, tell her how you feel and get her to be honest about her feelings too.  You owe it to yourself to get this over with or you will be stuck in the same situation for another five years.|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	Tell her.

And this is hard.  most women don't like hearing about his last relationships, but they are a clue to him.  Why he chose them.  As are your mistakes a clue to him about your soul.

Seriously, trying too hard always makes it more difficult. Men can sense desperation, and it's no aphrodisiac. Try finding something that you really enjoy doing (golf, scuba diving, hiking, gourmet cooking, baseball, softball, horticulture, aquarium keeping)  and pursue it enthusiastically.        Become the best you can at it.  Become an expert.   Join groups of people with the same interest.  Even if you don't fall in love with a fellow enthusiast, you will have learned something, made new friends, and become a more interesting person to know, and that can only help you attract a like-minded mate.

Be sure to call her mother and check on  her. She'll think you are really a nice guy. Dress formal, and drive a suburban, or mini-van. At her house and compliment her cooking.(That way you get to come back for more.) Bring the family with you,Cancer females can take it.

It's ok, to say you are pro marriage and to openly discuss it. He's there for you. He knows  how to treat women, afterall, his best friend is his mother.

Quando vendi un articolo (in questo caso te stesso) devi capire prima di tutto che tipo di cliente vuoi attirare, se dici a una donna che i suoi capelli sono tinti ma belli lo stesso attirerai solo donne un po' lobotomizzate...(non per questo + disponibili): prima cosa chiediti che donna ti piacerebbe colpire e poi mostra le parti reali del tuo carattere che possono piacere a una donna del tipo che tu prediligi. Secondo importante commento: il successo del playboy descritto dipende solo parzialmente dalla tecnica che usa e in buona misura dalla tranquillit con cui lui si propone alle donne, senza essere condizionato dal timore di essere respinto, questo ingrediente elimina del tutto il senso di responsabilit che un potenziale aquirente avverte: se capisci che un venditore ha bisogno di vendere ti senti a disagio, se invece in un acquisto vedi solo una nuova opportunit per te stesso puoi sentirti del tutto libero di accaparrarti un beneficio, soprattutto un beneficio che provatamente ha successo. I ragazzi che piacciono molto alle donne sono tranquilli nei loro approcci, mostrano un grande apprezzamento senza manifestare ansie di essere accettati, ridono e sorridono senza lesinare, esprimono sempre giudizi positivi sulle donne in generale (basta parlare solo di quello che sinceramente si apprezza, non dire cose che non si pensano) trattano ogni donna come se fosse speciale, se non vengono apprezzati semplicemente rimangono amichevoli e passano a una nuova conquista, pronti a rispolverare l'interesse se cambiano le carte in tavola. Il punto  fare capire "sei attraente e potenzialmente mi potresti piacere molto" poi, detto questo, proporre a una donna amichevolmente un'uscita con amici ( anche i propri, perch no...) mostrare apprezzamento e interesse per la compagnia in modo tranquillo ma deciso...io credo che questo faccia parecchio effetto e piacere, se non trovi riscontro non fare una piega e passa all'azione con una nuova ragazza. Fai questo con sistematicit e poi dimmi se non sei circondato da ragazze che ti apprezzano...io potrei essere tua mamma, ma del tutto disinteressamente penso che avrai successo.

919d0ba2ac4f2aca9d94a70fea321792aa	There is no reason that your man should cut out his female friends. People can have friends of the opposite sex. Especially females he may of been friends with for a long time. It is healthy to have friends of the opposite sex, it makes you a well rounded person. Just because he has female friends it does not mean he is friends with them in a romantic way.|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	You should never expect your man to give up his friends, male or female, unless they are a negative influence on him (into illegal drugs, heavy drinking, etc). It is not natural to have only female friends or only male friends. I'm sure you have male friends, and I doubt that your man would want you to give up those friends. Sometimes you need an outside perspective from a member of the opposite sex on your relationship, or on anything else that comes up in life. Not too mention having all male friends or all female friends just isn't healthy, the world is made up of both men and women, and you should be friends with both. If the female friends are a threat to the relationship, in that they are constantly hitting on him, or he's going to their houses alone and staying the night, or anything like that, that's another story, otherwise, it's perfectly natural, and you shouldn't ask him or expect him to give up his friends.|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	He should always keep his friends.  They give him advice on dealing with you.|`|8a9aa7e5d13b8f9a08cd06b4091bc860aa	I think we all have the right to friendships, and you making him cut out the friends he has is not necessary, you could make him aware of your feelings, but demanding someone to cut out their friends is horrible, seriously you must have a few guy friends that you keep in touch with as well.|`|b4bf849a1f6654f53092f2b097d98ad5aa	i don't like it either but i don't try to get him to ditch his friends. i'm sure you wouldn't want him to make you get rid of your guy friends (if you have them). i think the only point in the relationship you could ask that of him is if you were married. i know that it sucks but if you trust him it shouldn't be a problem.|`|eb25d160d22abf155d3ae5df784418e0aa	Man, Let the dude have his female friends if you trust him so much.  I wouldn't put up with that, I'd dump you.  Sorry...It's just not right.|`|AA11939205	all during my marriage I had female friends, its not fair to ask a man to change his friends just because he is in a commited relationship. if you trust him, then this should not be a issue.|`|AA12040217	its hard to say, it depends how hot his female friends are and if they go out and drink together, cuz if ur answer is yes to all those, i would say you should watch out|`|5bda053e71d86fd7c5896a6f01633183aa	Never... It is normal to have friends of the opposite sex and if you trust him then what is the problem? Do you have guy friends from high school or college or even work that you still talk to occasionally?|`|547a7b3dc2761f2d984e4af830750953aa	If they are just friends then there should never be a time he shouldnt call them. I have mostly platonic male friends and would never appreciate being told to stop calling them by anyone I was in a relationship with.      xx|`|AA11306843	Why do you think he should stop being friends with people just because they are female?  Maybe you should ask yourself why you don't trust him to have platonic relationships with women.  If your relationship is strong, what threat are they to you?  Or do you feel that they are trying to compete with you?  You need to figure out what's really at the root of this.|`|8d4bc2c968914f802c413e9dac1baa72aa	I wouldn't have a problem with him having female friends as long as we were all mutual friend's.  If they didn't know me and we couldn't hang out at any given time without there being a problem then they have to go.  If he doesn't want you to meet them then they are more than just friend's..  He's a liar and a loser.  He needs to go....  Sounds simple.  I know it's not, but no one like to be mistreated.  Good Luck!!!!!!!!1|`|0f5d2c44e7e00118af5d8465fe03a740aa	Have you asked him about his feelings for you? After 11/2 years, I would think he would be serious enough to not even think about calling any of his former girlfriends. And you stated that you trust him. If that's the case, why did you have to ask the question? If you trust him, then you trust that he's not still in contact with any former girlfriends.|`|AA10619944	No, any more than either of should have to cut out friends of any gender.    You are his girlfriend, and maybe even his potential wife, but that does not mean you become his everything so he doesn't need others.  In fact, its not healthy if he doesn't have outside friends.  If those friends are female, why do you feel threatened by them?    If he's given reasons for you not to trust them (i.e. he's cheated on you with them) then the problem is with him, not his friends.  Someone who can't be trusted can't be trusted no matter what restrictions you put on him.  And someone who can be trusted should be trusted no matter what freedoms you "allow."    That said, I know that if I didn't have my female best friend I would never know what to buy my wife for her birthday!|`|e8c50eb9018282dbeadd17099669c841aa	never my husband of one year still has female friends,if there's love and trust in the relationship you should be alright with it..also i am 26 and he is 34,and we were together 8years before getting married.good luck and hope it work's out for both of ye..
1eed2d993e93a863fae804407f6e8920aa	You know this hits home real bad for me. I lost my true love because he was killed in a snowmobile accident. It has been a hard road to walk on without him.

From the way you talk about sex it seems to me eaither you're really young or really niave.     If you're looking for acceptance and your bf is just looking for sex you'll probably just end up being manipulated for sex all the way through and then feeling shitty when he leaves you. Find your acceptance through friends, not sex.    If he's not just looking for sex than maybe he just wasn't comfortable with the *******... hard to believe but sometimes people are like that although if hes crazy about you it's pretty damn hard to do anything he won't like so take that in mind. [Edit] or yes, you didn't finish the job :P that gets annoying    You're going to end up being hurt eaither way, but that's life, its the summation of your experiences, you'll be better for it in the end, but avoid just being used for sex.

Even if in the same neighborhood.  If he starts his illusion's of granduar with you, I would be honest with him- if he's a close friend that is.  Tell him it bothers you.  And maybe, he will tell you what bothers him about you?  It can be a very insightful moment.  We all have our faults.  Illusion's of granduar isn't the worst kind of friend you can have in this world.  Atleast it's workable.  Usually, there just either insensitive to others or very self concious of their short-comings in life.  Most are people who are very insecure with themselves.  Be a friend.  Tell him what's on your mind.  But if he's just a casual friend, just say something like, "Well, gotta go".  He will sooner or later, get the message.|`|d34a258b3287a30a43cf4f6881298148aa	AS YOU CAN SEE HE WILL NEVER CHANGE!  SO JUST BRUSH IT OFF YOU SHOULDERS!

Each time you see him in the street then start to walk faster & as you pass him, just say "Hi" & hurrying by say something like "can't stop mate, running late"  Always keep any contact with him short & to the point. If you find you get caught up & he starts telling crap then just say something like "hate to be rude, but I really don't have time for this right now"  He'll soon realise that you're not interested in his chit-chat & search out another poor sod in order to bend their ear.

The difference between a crush and true love is like night and day! You'll definitely know when it happens.  Buuut... doesn't mean you'll fall in love with the guy you're meant to be with right from the start.

Instead of asking - "is it love", ask yourself - how long this love gonna last. Will it be days, months, years? Then, decide if you want to turn this love into a relationship.     In my view - if you love him now - go get him. You better try then regret.

Premirement tu veux que ton mari parle durant l'acte sexuel. Effectivement peut-tre ton mari est timide et n'ose pas dire ce qu'il ressent. Dans ce cas tu peux toujours prendre l'initiative de lui parler et lui demander de te rpondre. Mais ne lui parle surtout pas de problmes pendant l'acte parce que c'est pas trs excitant de rgler ses problmes sur l'oreiller. Tu peux aussi en discuter avec lui et lui demander de faire des tentative. Pour ce qui est du problme de la belle-soeur, et bien c'est le temps de faire ressortir ton caractre et lui parler dans le blanc des yeux. Tu n'as pas  laisser cette femme faire du trouble dans ton couple. En fait ce n'est pas elle qui sors avec ton mari c'est toi. Parles-lui si tu le peux. Dis lui fermement que son attitude te dpla?t et que tu n'as pas besoin d'elle pour parler et avoir une relation avec ton mari. Et puis essaie de limiter tes contacts avec elle. Si tu sais que c'est elle qui appelle, ne rpond pas. Ne va pas chez elle et ne lui parle pas de ce qui se passe dans votre couple. Discutes en aussi avec ton mari pour qu'il ne parle pas de vous  sa soeur. Si toutefois ton mari prend plus le parti de sa soeur que le tien, alors lui il a un problme. Parce que s'il t'aime il est cens de te protger pas de te nuire en apportant des sujets de commrage  sa vipre de soeur. Dans ce cas, poses-toi des questions sur le type de relation qui t'attend avec lui. C'est pas normal qu'un homme laisse sa soeur se mler de ses relations de couple. Pis si ta belle-soeur tente de montrer des gens contre toi et que cela fonctionne, c'est que ces gens sont aussi cons qu'elle et qu'ils ne mritent pas que tu leur porte de l'attention.|`|594da565f0676cb4f1a456462157e3b6aa	juste avant l'jaculation, repousse le|`|66045888836280923764aca92926c69caa	invites ta belle soeur a manger,  demande a ton homme d'etre abscent,  et discutes avec elle, en lui disant que tu aimes son frere.

ecafbe313e5a02ed42a509ec4b879991aa	Las consecuencias de la homosexualidad    La prctica desvergonzada de tales abusos no queda impune. La gente cosecha lo que siembra. La revista Practical Gastroenterology?public una serie de artculos sobre enfermedades causadas por la homosexualidad. La hepatitis simple, las infecciones del hgado, la gonorrea, la sfilis, las infecciones parasitarias, el linfoma del intestino delgado, la sarcoma de Kaposi y, por supuesto, el terrible SIDA... estas son solo algunas de las enfermedades consideradas en la mencionada publicacin, en sus nmeros de julio/agosto y septiembre/octubre de?1985.    Nuevas investigaciones revelan que el SIDA ocasiona da?os al cerebro y a la mdula espinal. La seccin cientfica del peridico The New York Times, del 15?de octubre de?1985, inform: Algunos de estos pacientes dan se?ales patentes de demencia, prdida de la memoria, incapacidad para hacer planes o tomar decisiones y una notable indiferencia a todo. Otros desarrollan parlisis parcial, prdida de coordinacin muscular o hasta peores problemas en el control de su organismo?[...] El cerebro de algunas vctimas del SIDA se reduce en tama?o. Sus cavidades internas, llamadas ventrculos, se expanden y porciones de la tan importante corteza cerebral se consumen?[...] Aunque se pueden elaborar tratamientos que detengan la infeccin viral y permitan que el sistema inmunolgico se recupere, es muy probable que los da?os al cerebro sean permanentes.    Actualmente el SIDA es incurable, siempre es mortfero; la cantidad de casos se duplica anualmente, y se est propagando por todo el mundo. Principalmente son los homosexuales quienes padecen de esta enfermedad, pero tambin aflige a los drogadictos que se inyectan la droga y a las personas que reciben transfusiones de sangre o productos derivados de la sangre. Tambin afecta a los ni?os que nacen de madres que tienen el virus. Puesto que se transmite por medio de los fluidos del cuerpo, este virus se halla en la sangre, el esperma, la orina, la saliva y las lgrimas. El perodo de incubacin es largo. Puede que pasen muchos a?os desde que la persona contrae el virus hasta que el SIDA se le declare, lo cual hace imposible que se diagnostique en una etapa temprana. El virus permanece como una bomba de tiempo, esperando estallar... pero ?quin sabe cundo?    Ahora est explotando por todo el mundo. Se calcula que en los Estados Unidos ms de un milln de personas algunos dicen que casi dos millones han sido expuestas al virus del SIDA. De los ms de 14.500?casos que han surgido desde?1981, ms de 7.000?personas han muerto. El nmero de casos sigue aumentando por todo el mundo: Europa, Asia, Australia, pases del Caribe, unas 20?naciones africanas y 15?pases de Norte y Sud Amrica. La cantidad de naciones que el a?o pasado informaron casos de SIDA a la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud, ubicada en Ginebra, Suiza, aument de?40 en agosto a?71 en octubre, con un total de aproximadamente 17.000?casos.    Una vida que Jehov no aprueba    La homosexualidad no es otro estilo de vida que Jehov Dios apruebe. Frecuentemente, tanto homosexuales como predicadores liberales tergiversan las Escrituras en un esfuerzo intil por hacer parecer que Dios s considera aceptable tal vida. (2?Pedro 3:16.) Hace miles de a?os Jehov destruy a Sodoma porque la mayora de los varones de esa ciudad eran homosexuales. (Gnesis 19:4-25.) Siglos ms tarde el apstol Pedro asemej a los hombres que imitaban a aquellos sodomitas a animales irracionales nacidos naturalmente para ser atrapados y destruidos. (2?Pedro 2:6-13.)    Con lenguaje inconfundible, el inspirado apstol Pablo condena tanto la homosexualidad como el lesbianismo: Dios los entreg a apetitos sexuales vergonzosos, porque sus fminas cambiaron el uso natural de s mismas a uno que es contrario a la naturaleza; y as mismo hasta los varones dejaron el uso natural de la fmina y se encendieron violentamente en su lascivia unos para con otros, varones con varones, obrando lo que es obsceno y recibiendo en s mismos la recompensa completa, que se les deba por su error. (Romanos 1:26,?27.)    No se extraven tambin escribi Pablo. Ni fornicadores, ni idlatras, ni adlteros, ni hombres que se tienen para propsitos contranaturales, ni hombres que se acuestan con hombres, ni ladrones, ni personas dominadas por la avidez, ni borrachos, ni injuriadores, ni los que practican extorsin heredarn el reino de Dios. (1?Corintios 6:9, 10.) Otras traducciones de la Biblia vierten la expresin hombres que se acuestan con hombres de varias maneras, como por ejemplo: sodomitas, pervertidos, hombres que tienen trato sexual con otros hombres, varones que se echan con varones, varones que cohabitan con varones y, sencillamente, homosexuales.

You go to her favorite chair and talk to her as though she was sitting in it.  Tell her exactly what you've done and how sorry you are.  Next, confess to God and ask for His forgiveness.  Then, pay the credit card company for the debt you've made.  You gave your friend $50 and told her it was because you loved her.  You didn't tell her it was to pay the debt you made without her permission so, it was a love gift you gave her and not money to pay the credit card debt.  Since your friend died 4 days ago, you still have time to pay up before the statement comes out showing the $50 charge unpaid.  There's no need to involve her family if the charge gets taken care of.

Je ne dis pas qu'il ne m'arrive jamais de craquer pour le physique d'un homme, mais ce n'est pas ce qui influencera mes sentiments envers lui.  J'aime les personnes intelligentes, profondes, intgres, cultives, qui ont de l'humour et un brin de folie.  Le physique n'est pas, pour moi, une barrire ou un avantage, si quelqu'un de poli et d'agrable me parle, je lui parle. Ce qui me permet de dcouvrir des tre merveilleux.

I wouldn't concern myself if I was going to die 20 years from now.  I would be focusing on what I'm going to accomplish in the next 20 years and then when the 20 years was up I would re-evaluate and set some new goals and by the way be celebrating that I was still alive like I do everyday.

My best guy friend liked me when we first started t become friends and I thought of him only as a friend.

They were together for 3 years and somewhere in the middle of that I realized I liked him. A few months after they broke up we were both in the same place..we liked each other at the same time, and we started dating.

I'll tell you that it is not easy..seeing them together with their arms and hands on each other-its not pretty and it hurts. However if you are meant for each other it will happen.

Good luck|`|AA11817420	Sadly your friend is at the age where depression and thoughts of suicide strike hard.  There are so-called "Youth Information Centres" for people between 16-25 that can offer advice, it may be worth checking them.    Speak to a recruitment agency, see if they can offer him a job to pay his bills and, if possible, seek further education.    Why does his mother want to kick him out? Is it because of his problems and depression? Sounds like they need to come to some agreement, at least until he can move out. Homelessness is a very serious situation and very hard to get out from.    Maybe if your friend sacrificed an hour of his day to help out in the house, then his mother would get off his back? Little things even, like take the bin out or do a bit of washing?    At 18 people need space. Help him by being his friend, get him to get on with life and move on only when ready.

What a loser he was, and you are so fortunate that you saw him for who he was, before it was to late. Some of these sick relationships end up in murder. You start a new life and follow your dreams.

74c2b53364dfcecc6da379c05ae28df2aa	First of all, what is it that you are actually afraid of? The actual proposing to her and the two of you stepping into a new part of your lives, or rejection, either by her or your families and society?  Before you decide to propose to her or not to, you really need to find out what it is that you're actually afraid of.  Once you know that, than you'll know in your heart whether you should propose to her or not.   A lot of the time when we are in a relationship with someone, a lot of the time, we believe that because we are in that relationship that we should love them. That is why so many people put up with things like violence (I'm not trying to say that you don't love her). Then we often think that the next step must be marriage and the possibility of children. It's in our nature to assume that these things come next in our lives.  If you're afraid that she'll reject you, you need to ask her anyway, otherwise you'll be spending the rest of your life wondering what could have been.|`|130dadb91829440736b2936b978fed56aa	You already know what to do.

It's not until you talk with a woman and enjoy who she is as a person as well, that the sex fantasy happens.     Although we do picture them naked almost immediately.

878cf7b72bdc49c7e860206525190c97aa	Good grief, girlie! You're not frigid, you're only 15 years old.  I think that what you are feeling is pressure to do things that other teens say they are doing.  You know, when a guy asks you out that shouldn't automatically mean something sexual has to happen!  Maybe you can simply go somewhere and hang out with other friends.  I know that's what my younger daughter does sometimes and she just turned 17.   And there is no really right or wrong way "to do it" if you wait for the right person.  What you have is far to special to just throw away to some random boy that asks you out.  It's ok to follow some trends like how you dress, wear your hair, cell phones, text messaging and myspace.  But when it comes to what you do with your body that's a trend that you don't have to follow.  You'll be glad later that you aren't lugging around the luggage of past sexual encounters that meant nothing.|`|005bb9648467445be99d79db5bd75da2aa	You won't know until you try.

I can kiss total strangers or people I don't know very well, but when you're in that "getting to know someone" stage where you're assessing actual potential it just seems like so much pressure.

The long and the short of it is this: Some people, men and women, actually enjoy putting themselves in a martyr situation.  They are abused or neglected and they continue to end up in these relationships.  You and I wouldn't want that, but there are some who only feel comfortable with that, specific type of relationship.    Many people don't realize that the term, "Attractive" is a combination of at least two things; outward appearance (looks) and personality.  If someone doesn't look like a model, but he/she is a fantastic person with a great attitude - he/she only needs to be in a place where he/she has the opportunity to communicate with others for this to be known.  The more you know and like someone, the less the physical appearance plays in the importance of a possible relationship.  Looks start to match personality.    The same happens in reverse.  A gorgeous God/Goddess is the admiration of all who see him/her.  Then it speaks and it's rude, obnoxious, puts out a holier-than-thou attitude, belittles all around him/her.  Whether it's being overly concerned about him/herself, or just not caring at all about others, this person is not dating material and the human mind has a way of leveling out the playing field - looks starts to match personality again.    Remember, with people, it's all a matter of perspective.  Where you're sitting and what you're seeing.|`|AA10943966	looks are always secondary to the nature of the person..    they don't matter to me much, frankly...... if i find a good guy...... i won't see  how he looks.......... i would love his soul not looks..    well in ur case........ there are people... both men n women....... who are physically attracted to looks....... you can't help it, till they themselves realise that looks actually are not that important..    God bless!

I don't foresee her up and leaving this guy for you.  I also don't foresee her current man being up for a polyamorous arrangement, so just cheerfully accept your status as "dirty little secret" and get on with life.  Or with another girl who will give you the type and level of attention you really want in a relationship.|`|bda6e2eaaccfe48b6f291b4d0b1b95b4aa	I don't know if she wants you, but I'd say stay MILES away from her.  If the two of you DID get together, you wouldn't be able to trust her not to mess around on you when you're away.    You can't say 'oh she wouldn't do that to me', because obviously she doesn't even value you enough to be in a relationship with you when she is emotionally available.      Even if she does show interest in the future, I wouldn't touch her, who gives a **** if she wants you or not, or if she's into bondage if that means being dishonest to someone who obviously doesn't derserve it.

The next time she is going out with somoeone, don't make yourself so readily available for her to snog and see how she likes it, she may very well "loose it" cos she isn't getting what she wants but DON'T LET HER USE YOU, that is all she is doing.    She is messing around with your feelings.|`|9835e5854fae71344e8794bdb7db653caa	Sounds like she likes you, but when she split up from this guy before she wasn't ready for another relationship. As nothing was said, she probably thought that you weren't that into her. Plus, you're her friend so she doesn't want to do anything that would damage what you've already got. Now she's got another guy, she's wishing that she was with you instead. Go talk to her about your relationship (if you ended up in bed together then there'll be something to talk about) and try and find out what's going on. You may get her as a girlfriend.|`|d76d9f59d39f361941b8aedf7c99fff0aa	She likes you but she wont tell you. Use the clues she has been giving you. Now you can give me some advice.

I don't think these people are serious, and I cannot guess at their state of mind.  However, the important thing is that you are comfortable in your own skin.  I hope you are because you're the one who has to live there.|`|b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	yes, you are too fat.  I'm sure no one asks you out and i'm sure that girls are not jealous of you.  Why be jealous of a chubby midget!|`|ebcf94c777acc51b305b024fd4e32a1faa	yes i like Gymnast because they can do things with their body that most girls cant.... and i love to watch that...|`|AA11056379	your not fat...i would think the other girls are jelous for sure. If anything, you are likely training your body to much..doing to much execercise. You probaly have muscles that tmake you look abit bigger..but in a muscular way..not a fat way.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	The only opinions that matter are those of the people you respect.  Do you respect these girls who call you fat?  Do your trainers/coaches call you fat?  Those are the opinions that matter, not silly high schoolers who are more likely reality TV addicts.    You're growing up, be strong.  Look at yourself and know your strengths and weaknesses.  Don't let anyone else tell you about yourself unless they have shown themselves to be qualified.|`|6b0aa095391ccc2a0ca89272b8a93b3baa	This is going to be hard to believe, but whatever everyone else thinks does not matter.  It really doesn't.  You can never please everyone and many people in the USA don't even know what healthy really is.  If you are having doubts talk to a nutritionist and your coach.  Listen but be prepared to weed out the static.  You are probably going to have to develop a thick skin because, even as you get older, there are going to be a lot of people that are going to be ignorant to reality.  Good Luck!|`|AA11547447	youre body doesnt actaully stop growing until ya around 25 yrs old n who cares if people call ya fat you know ya not thats all that matters isnt it?|`|bd9d31c9be1a3d0f7f5da4cd87862aadaa	grls are jealous. i would kill to be that skinny.    :]]]  your not too thin. i would never do that. i promise.|`|dab788741585882704ea269ec92ea3c1aa	I don't think you have anything to worry about.

Dont listen to them. You have a good they going and are achieving something they probably cant. Keep strong and dont listen to their crap.

So then you can rub it in their faces. Good luck and keep your chin up.|`|47ff23d8737af81bc19f63510823e3edaa	Dont be stupid...how could you be fat at 90lbs?Look around ans see how many girle are really bigger and heavier than toy.You should talk to your teacher and your parents about what others are saying abput you.That BF seems like ans axx.The best friend is a jealous twit.|`|a4f362c6e87cd70b96be7ecc68c11777aa	Of course there jealous because they know that us gymnast are great at what we do I am in gymnastics,ballet,  volleyball, track, cross country, competitive swimming, and I'm a lifeguard at an indoor pool. When your skinny and are very flexible of course their going to be jealous their just made because they don't have skills like us. You are not fat fat is weighing 109 lbs hunny thats how much I weigh but it's all muscle, also I got so sick of everyone at my high school now I go to a private school and do home schooling. I'm 5'4 and 16 and I'm not done growing remember that everyone else is just insignificant if they don't respect dance and gymnastics.Jazzie J.

8d93be7de642007bf17bebd39f3fdbc1aa	Sounds like this guy was anything but a "really sweet guy".  From the sound of it, he was an insensitive jerk the whole time, and you, unfortunately, just happened to find out about it too late.    You let him walk all over you, and from the sound of it, he knew that he could do it and get away with it.  That's where you went wrong.  It had nothing to do with sex or affection or love from you.  That only kept him coming back for a short time.    Relationships are about compromise, not letting your partner walk all over you.  If are uncomfortable about your partner's actions, tell them.  If they refuse to change, move on.  If they don't have enough respect for you, then they don't love you.|`|fbb10896697e8f4c3813a43506616b7caa	lady that was you mistake, you never go into a relationship giving your all.

Works both ways  (and if it doesn't, he's not worth keeping around anyway)

Women generally worry about personality rather than penis size. There is nothing more wasteful than a big dick on a big dick-head...    It's not the size of the wand, but the wizard who uses it...

8e94b0948c7b77b5bb4d0b32575d39ffaa	If you continue to look and search desperatly to find a girl, you will find alot more heartache then you will if you try any other method.  The best method I can advise for you, is to relax, enjoy life, focus off of finding a girl and when the right girl comes, you'll see her for who she is. By using this method you won't find heaps of wrong girls in the way (you might find one or two wrong girls, but the number will drasticly lower)  And as another tip, if you want to make sure when you do find a girl, it lasts, make sure not to focus on sex (even now while you have noone, if sex is a big thing on your mind it can really ruin it) just realise that it's an added bonus to it all :)|`|c97e85517f8b868aa8ff496831d058cdaa	Be sexy, and don't get a pot belly.|`|a62ed0eee583afc54803b423831fa203aa	keep looking.  they're out there.|`|8499451e497bcc671faacbe4fcf5b179aa	hey boy  you can easily find a good girl yaar .  just go in more parties, meet new people and socialise  and thats it . i bet you will definately find somebody good at  heart .........may be not a girlfriend but a good friend for sure|`|d468f9232973f773a98005c9b6f6dc2caa	Hi,I will suggest you a dating site ,join it .best of luck.  http://www.freewebs.com/dayting/index.ht...  http://www.geocities.com/rapsodys_desire...

She's not sitting idle, doing nothing.  She no longer wants to be with you and this shows it.  She needs what you can do for her, but she wants to be somewhere else with someone else.  This way she can have her cake and eat it to.  Don't allow yourself to be used and disrespected this way.  Move out and you'll feel better.|`|f8a684ea53431f9bf217fa0c8448c67baa	You should break up with her.  You don't need to be with someone who is with other guys.  Who knows.

383195d67495b15ffac268eb41346e59aa	You need to be descriptive, tell him exactly what you would do to him. Start with kissing on neck etc.... move down over chest and thighs.   You gotta also tell him what you are doing to yourself while you are on the phone, how it is making you feel. Phone sex is very erotic and a great way of being intimate.   If you have already told him what you would like him to do to you use it in your "chat". You could use a fantasy. You dont have to go all the way to one of you {or both} climaxing, be comfortable with what you are doing and you can always tell him youll call him again tomorrow to carry on where you left off.  May help to do it when you are relaxed and perhaps had a drink just to make you feel less self concious.  Good luck, it will be fun.

c8f05583595d08dc74759a6b49a8c657aa	Spend sometime with your girlfriends.  Give him an opportunity to miss you.      Right now you are offering him companionship, but he has no obligation to you.|`|AA12278224	be yourself , go out injoy life as you normally would and either he will see you for what you are or you will find someone else that fits you better|`|AA12365118	I have been in your situation more than once!  I enjoyed the connection for a while, but they always ended up so that I had to let them go so I could be free to do other things and take care of myself.  It makes people look weak, which is unattractive to the person / people we are after. Move on as quickly as you can. Be friendly, but stop going on these false dates; it will just frustrate you more.  If he sees something in you, it will occur when you move on, but the energy should flow from him toward you. Don't wait around whatever you do! And good luck.|`|ece926c42329469288c64379a3fc502eaa	by going out with mr.hot (me)|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Where do i need to start???  Yes there might be a connection, but you don't even know this guy.  Physical attraction is great but there's more to it than that.  It's so simple to move past this because you haven't even invested any time into it.  Don't you realize how many awesome guys that are out there that want more than just a casual relationship.  If you still can't get over this guy then just be his friend for now and maybe more can develop over time.  Maybe it will, maybe it won't but atleast you can get to know him a little better and then you can tell if he is worth it or not.|`|f104436844b6b2f785bd5485f71042b9aa	My fiance' and I started out that way.  As attracted to him as I was, I had to focus on other things and date other people... or so he thought at the time.  I know how hard it is to get him off your mind.  Try not to pay too much attention to him, men get a lot of satisfaction from that and they gain control.  Remember that you are a Goddess of sorts... You can be "Ungettable", and  he needs to realize that.  He may change his way of seeing things.  And if not, well then it is time to let him go.  I would try this for about 6 weeks.  I'm not sure how long you have been seeing him, but if it has been for more than 3 months, you may well be waisting your time.  He really may not be ready.  Whatever you do, do not pressure him.  You will only add to the stress you already feel just thinking about him.  I remember ready in a book written by Greg Behrendt... "Don't Waste The Pretty"  Good book.  You might want to go pick that up.  Maybe even the book titled... "When Men Love Bitches".  Illuminating and funny...|`|a95798c65a9593f00697d56d72facac1aa	I'd say he was very "clear" about his "intentions", he isn't "interested in a relationship at this time".  That doesn't mean you can't go out and have fun.    If you want "more" than what he is able to offer, look elsewhere!    Good luck.|`|9ccd8c8ad4abb19a69be5724be844dfcaa	You should just try to find someone else or try to go out whit friends.|`|66aab86d682b7b5c31d251814f84eea4aa	Best thing you can do is believe him when he said he is not interested in a relationship with you.   As far as you being a couple, it's not an option.  Find someone who is interested or be happy being with yourself

Then she calls her mom to tell her she has a ride with you. She also talked to you about what kind of car she wants.  Dude that is boring, but she talked to you about it just to be with you.

It is very important to me to have good credit, we have been working on this and it is improving. Once we paid off the hospital bills our credit has gotten a lot better. By the way I am 22 and my husband is 28.|`|AA11778516	recently i had a letter from a cred card company saying that i was in debt with them, i live in a huge house which are made into flats and i know everyone who lives here...they all know me too....someone in my house has got a card in my name and used my details to get this card...the bill comes to 300.00 and a few pence..they sent me another letter threatening to take me o court so i wrote back and told them that i have never taken out a credit card and that someone has used my name to get money..they are having none of it because i cannot prove who it is....it could be someone who's lived here in the past and moved out because i do trust the people who live here....each time i get a letter from them, the bill gets bigger but i refuse to pay it because i did not get the card...now they are threatening to send bailiffs to my home...this dos worry me but i am adamant in my word and  will not pay it....i cant prove who it was and i cannot prove that i didn't get the card, but i know i didn't and that's my final argument with these people....i wont pay it, and i don't care if they slam me in jail...i am not paying for something that i did not get in the first place...i have spoken to CAB and they said pretty much the same as the police...unless i can prove who did it...i don't have a leg to stand on....still not paying it though...no way...|`|dfab90ad560e700598ef3d273baf7e9baa	When I was 25 I had to file for bankruptcy and it was the best and worst decision of my life.  At the time it freed me from having to pay back my creditors......awesome!!  However now at 43 I am still trying to establish good credit, I have a secured credit card (you have to put money done to get about 200 dollars credit on the card)  I had not pursued trying to repair my credit for years, I saved up and paid cash for the stuff I wanted and needed.  It has been a long road but it is coming.  Last year my hubby and I wanted to buy a new house, we tried to put my name on the mortgage and they turned us down, said that if they put my name on there we wouldn't be able to buy the house we loved because my credit wouldn't allow us to borrow that much money.  If I were you I would work as hard as you can to repair your credit NOW.  You have years ahead of you and you don't want to hit the wall every time you want to make a purchase such as the motorcycle!!  Or even worse depend on other to help you out whenever you need or want to purchase something, work on it with the help of a credit counsellor, they will help you understand how to save, spend and repair that horrifying credit you currently have.  Good luck.

Just let him go until he becomes single AND is over her.  You don't want to be with someone who is in love with someone else.  But then again we don't know if he loves her because he was kissing you.  Ah, just leave him be a dog to someone else.|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	leave him alone until he's single.

A good suprise is something that men love; try suprising him with his favorite dinner(or taking him out to his favorite restaurant), try something he's always wanted to try in the bedroom, and leave little love notes around the house in places that you know he'll find them. And remember that your man should always have eyes only for you regardless of the special things you do! Good luck!|`|b54f870336c987fe0bd8eae5a9fc495aaa	Stop worrying about it.

c64f66096640221b0762d74e09be96dfaa	Well, my wife is Hindu by birth or national origin (India), but she is not a staunch believer in religious images, idols, gods, goddesses, or all of the fascinating and mysterious divine beings, which I find awesome to explore and understand; she believes in the social aspect of getting together and meeting people.  She's a socialite with uncanny powers of mingling and leaving the best impression.  If you consider that a spiritual gift, then, well, she's probably way better off than I am, since I cannot see how a person abandons so much spiritual imagery, stories, folklore, legends, history, and knowledge.  Together, we love and tolerate, so it all ends in restful sleep.  What else matters?|`|75c62407faf4b0c2c8e862bf28e5df31aa	It can't, but that depends on how important your faith is to you.

But, if youre strong in your faith, (taking that youre Christian).  Ask the Lord if this is the man that He has set out for you.  James 1:5    Always, place God first and He will direct your ways.    From a non religious point of view, youd also have to take into consideration how youll raise you kids.

Maybe you both can learn about each others religion and hey maybe one can convert.  Then the parent thing comes into play were they feel weird that the other is of a different religion, and their grandkids, which religion should they believe.

AA11788090	That is a tough situation. Try just talking to her. Let her know that real love doesn't have to hurt, and that you are behind her with the rest of your family to give you support and protection any way you can. She has to make this decision on her own. She is probably just scared that he will do something to her, or try to kill her or maybe even of being alone. Just talk to her every chance you get and let her know how much you love her. Have your family do the same if they know.|`|59dd0d0f851dd49189f8dcfb0ec58b68aa	this is going to sound extreme but it has to be one of thee two, its th eonly way. get her to file a polivce report, or go to a womens shelter. the other is im assuming you have at least one gu yfriend whos kinda big, or at least can fight... have him straighten out the guy.|`|AA10006585	Does your sister realize that she is in an abusive relationship?  Did she ask you for help?  If so, you could contact your local women's safe house or give your sister the number to call.  It's a good thing they don't live together, so getting your sister TO a shelter isn't necessary---unless she doesn't feel safe.    Encourage her to start filing police reports if her boyfriend physically assaults her again.  It's good to have this on record incase there's ever court in the future.  Just be there for her, and encourage her that she needs to get out of this abusive relationship.  She deserves better!  Good luck!|`|5637ad17250338b1fcba52b6de1eff27aa	I hate to say it this way, but if you can't help someone who doesn't want help. If you get her out of that situation, and she really doesn't want it, she will go right back. I have seen it with one of my own family members. And each time she leaves and then goes back to him the beatings will just get worse. Either he needs to agree to go get couseling and figure out where his anger is coming from (while your sis is out of the picture) or IF SHE REALLY wants the help  GET HER OUT NOW before he does something really bad and there is no way to help her. She may think that it was her fault, that she provoked it somehow. Help her to see that when a man strikes a woman no matter what the reason, IT IS NOT  HER FAULT. and vise versa. Nobody should be mentally or physically abused by the person who claims to love them. GOOD LUCK.|`|d8856ebe30869f7ab8c71b23e9dcdb33aa	I've been in this situation with two close family members.  All you can do is be there for her.  Until and only until she is fed up with all the crap and wants out, will she leave the situation.   You're wasting your time trying to get her out of it--she won't listen and will keep going back.

Watch him and if he looks at you quite often from time to time, HE LIKES YOU!   If you are hanging out with a guy you usually don't hang out with and that could be a possible boyfriend, the guy that likes you will become interested and will stare at you and the guy you are hanging out with. If he is the bold type he might try to become involved with the two of you which definitely means he likes you!!!   If he talks to your friends a lot he probably likes you.   If he tries to be near you and suddenly takes an interest in things you like, he likes you.   If he talks to you and acknowledges you in some way, this is a sure sign he likes you!   If he tries to make you laugh or says stuff sarcastically that he thinks is funny, again he most likely likes you.   Lastly, if he is nervous around you, he likes you.|`|ce6db5670c5f81e3852bacefbb9455e1aa	i say flirt back and see who it goes from there....if he seems into it the go along until you are sure you like him...then ask him out..|`|140a0670d4fcedb065585e7c87079477aa	yea id say that hes flirting with u and i think that u should flirt back with him and see where that takes u

When we got to the pier we decided to walk to the end.  I can still remember how pretty the lights made the dark water look.

We only dated for about six weeks and still to this day are still attracted to each other, but the timing was just wrong.  We still flirt  a lot and we tease each other equally.

625a2948d7ab950fa4ada259796bbaa2aa	Actually, (and please note that I don't speak for most people), I would find it amusingly cute.      Any man that does not understand that women may bend the truth about their age probably isn't ready for a relationship with a woman, anyway.  That's not to say that the man you're referring to isn't ready, but I would be astounded if, after 4 years, he didn't know at least that much about your gender.    Regarding the events of childhood... I suppose that would depend on what they were and, of course, why you thought the previous story you told made you feel more comfortable.    I found out everything I never wanted to know  about my spouse through family get-togethers.  Thanksgiving and Christmas and birthday parties can be very informative!  :-)|`|AA12338431	No, you should never lie about so much stuff.  They wouldn't know what was the truth and what wasn't.|`|4133a10daa153b6fa97d3be5665cad5baa	No I couldn't forgive you for lying for 4yrs. All that shows is that you never really cared about the relationship and gets them thinking about what else your hiding and lying about. Nobody could forgive you for lying that long.|`|AA11923501	If everything was ok,we would get through it easy.|`|f1e18b1c8665106476c2f299856ddaa3aa	no id be pissed, unles you were awesome in bed and had a sweet body|`|38705430e9be633b027ef4ac2faff7b8aa	After I stopped laughing I thought I had to answer. If you are that much of a liar, and that able and competent at it, then don't expect any sympathy from your man. I have one rule for my friends as well as partner - no lies. I have a zero tolerance policy on this. If you lie, you are gone. NO questions asked. I think lying is the most disgusting thing you can do to someone. You said you lied for a reason - there is no reason. It doesn't matter if you were a crack using prostitute for ten years, tell the truth and rely on the integrity of the other person to either accept you or not- if not, move on. Good Luck|`|cb3016009dec394ffc64c091e152a39baa	Its should be fine... provided u have a good reason to do so|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	No. I'd wonder what else you lied about.|`|AA11939205	i could get over these smaller lies, but I would also be thinking about what else you could have lied about.

Write about the places you dream about traveling with her.  Write about the dream house you want to live in with her.  Write about the way she makes you feel.  Write about the ultimate careers you both will have.  Write about all the different things she makes you think about and then keep them with you and spend the rest of your lives going after them together.

I am sure you are looking out for your friend, it is obvious that he has decided what he wants to do and that no one can change his mind. Although it is worth talking to your friend about, maybe if he knew what was going on he might change his way of thinking. Remember that your friend is going to date whoever he chooses and that a friends support is the best. You do have the choice of calling off the friendship, tell why if you choose to do that.

HWojJn0qaa	Wow reading your question really made me cry. You are an amazing person and it sounds like you are doing a brilliant job of bringing up your nephew. It sounds like you are happy to bring him up so I don't think putting him into care would be the right thing to do. I know you are probably thinking about all the things you do wrong as his carer but no situation is perfect and it's ok to make mistakes.   I think you need more support from people, I can't believe the way your family are acting, they should be helping you not putting you down.   Make sure you talk to social services about any problems you have as they are there to help you. I know a lot of people see them as ogres that go around taking peoples children into care but they only do that as a last resort. I am sure they could also help you find a way to go back to college when your nephew has settled a bit more.   Anyway I think as long as you are happy you should keep your nephew, you sound like a great parent.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	what a tragic real life story and what a wonderful person you sound to be, how sad and disappointing that you are not getting the help and support that you deserve from your family.  It sounds like they are wearing you down with their negative comments, you have put your own life on hold to take care of your nephew you should be proud and so should your family.  You are doing all of this with little support plus still grieving for your sister, try not to take your selfish families comments to heart you are doing a great job.  There is lots of help and support for you, have a word with social services next time they come, don't worry they wont see it as a failure on your part they will only be to willing to help, they might be able to get your little nephew into a playschool for about two or three hours a couple of times a week to enable him to play with others and to enable you to have some time to yourself, your sister would have been very proud of you and well done to your boyfriend to.|`|358Qy3Juaa	as a mum if i was unable to care for my children i would definatley want someone like you your sister was and is very lucky to have you and so is your nephew. As long as you do what you think is right you cant go wrong don't worry every mum gets it wrong at least ten times a day  but your not getting anything wrong it will take a long time to get over your breavemnet and even long for your nephew dig your heels in and follow your heart and you'll do a smashing job and dont let anyone tell you other wise. thtas the secret of being a good mum/ gaurdian keep going this is odviously something you want to do. good luck to you and when things are hard just smile in peoples faces and say thank but think f"%* you!!!|`|HUhheZWtaa	Your A very strong person (in the heart) to take this on. and at the moment your all he has. i think you should keep him and look after him.    sorry about your sister  hope i helped|`|VKn6QpMJaa	I'm So Srry ABout Ur sister Lost  Nd 2 wat's Happenning to u...

I say you are a freeking saint!    18 is a young age to be taking so much on, but I think you are doing it for the right reasons. But its really awful that your family is being dreadful not supporting you .. in particular - when you are grieving to. I guess they are just trying to think of what is best for the boy, but - I think you are the best thing for him.    I would consider going to have a chat to counselor in order to deal with your own grief and the process of trying to raise this boy.    Girl - I take my hat off to you. You are 1 in a million. Truly amazing.|`|wzGSdBHsaa	Firstly i congratulate you on what you have done for your nephew up till now you are a very brave girl. If you put him in to care now i think you will regret it later,he is a part of you,if you family don't want to help well that's their problem. I'm sure it's hard for you but if i were you i would hang in there. He needs the love of his family right now not strangers.  Good luck in whatever you decide.|`|Z7kEGg4uaa	In my opinion keep him, he is best with his family and you sound like your doing a good job. Don't take any notice of your family and just tell them that if they think your doing the wrong thing, then should have him.|`|0SoDvjU7aa	i feel for you & i feel for him.....i also feel for your sister.You are doing a fantastic honour of her life by looking out for her son.I don't understand the rest of your family though,i know it's hard to pay bills as well as provide for little ones but he is one of your own & the closest positive reminder of your sad loss.Surely between you all you can come to some arrangement with weekdays & weekends or some monetary contributions.I can understand you questioning the possibility of putting him into care but that could be heartbreaking for him for the rest of his life.There's a lot of abuse in care although i hesitate to point the finger i'm aware it happens.On the other hand he could end up with a fantastic loving family who long for a child of their own although at 3 years old he would miss the familiarity of his real family.He will not be so dependant for ever & you are young enough to have plenty of time to regain full control of your life with the support of your of your fella.The love & respect you will receive in return from your nephew in years to come when he realises just how much you've done for him will outweigh any hardship you may endure.You sound like the kind of person that would deeply regret the descision of letting him go as future contact would be limited if at all.As for your sister in law she sounds like a cold hearted ***** who has no opinion worth listening to.How would she feel if she lost her husband & had to cope with kids on her own???..............i hope you stand by your blood & have the strength to see it through coz it's only a short period of time to get through as opposed to feeling guilty for the rest of your life.  bless ya life.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	I think the decision you made was courageous and honorable.  Your family should be more supportive of you.  You took on a big responsibility.  You can always go back to college, you only  have one chance at raising this little boy.  If social services say you are doing a good job and you and your boyfriend are good with the situation, then please keep your nephew.  The foster system is awful for children.   As soon as they get used to one family they are ripped out and sent to another one.  Trust me, not all the families are nice families either.  My opinion-You are a good woman who is doing an awesome thing.  Raise this little boy and teach him everything your sister would have.|`|DlHfmzaiaa	Sorry this has happened to you but you are doing an amazing thing and your family sound like they should be more supportive. Would your sister want to see him go in care? But if your family wont support you then you cant blame yourself. Cant your parents help out? It must be difficult but children can be so rewarding as well as everything else. Maybe you have a gut feeling about what is best. It doesnt matter that you dropped out of college you did it for the right reasons. This poor little boy has lost his mum and im sure that he is lucky to have you. You say you are 18 that is very young to deal with all this try and get some kind of help if you can Good luck xxx|`|0cee0a2ed5eb28d8024ce54ceae47590aa	You lost a sister and took on her child.  If you give this child up, who will love him as much as you do??.. who else could stand in his mothers shoes??    Stuff your family, they're uncaring and cold. Please keep the child with you and carry on giving him the love he deserves and needs.  He cries for his mum because at the moment he only knows he had one. He will forget her though and you will be the one he will look to.  I believe your sister is watching you and happy her son is in the care of someone that can love and care for him the way she would have done.  You will regret giving him up, and your heart will break.  You both need each other.  His needs are more important and thankfully, you saw that before your own needs and wants.  What a lucky little boy he is to have an aunt like you.  Please don't abandon him the way the rest of the family appear to have done.  He's just a child.|`|AA12324252	In your heart you know the answer. Do what's in the best interest of the child. GOD gave you this gift .What are you going too do?|`|mDkUmEUzaa	I think you are marvellous!  I actually have tears in my eyes reading this.  I think the little lad is better of with someone who knows and loves him and that person is you.    How would you feel if he went into care?  You would be constantly worrying about him, you would have limited (if no access) and the poor little lad wouldnt know if he was coming or going.    Ignore silly women in the park - they are not worth it.    Your family I should think will come round.  I cant tell you how much I admire you for what you are doing.  I would do the same for any of my sisters children.  When, as you say, he has settled down a bit, get him to nursery so he is mixing with other children then hopefully your life will become a lot easier - you are only 18 and have plenty of time ahead of you to continue your studies.  There are younger mums than you out there.    I think your sister was blessed to have you and I am sure that she appreciates what you have taken on.    Dont put him into care - I can tell you will regret it.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	My opinion is that he belongs with family. You are  the best thing for him right now.    Do not let their opinions sway your thinking.    It is so easy to pass judgment when you are not  the responsible party.    Treat him like he is your own. It is what your sister  would want.    Have less contact with them for a while, so that  their words have less effect.    It is fine to take a break from college so that the boy  adjusts better, but you will need to start treating him  like there is nothing wrong soon so he is none the  wiser.    Put him in daycare when the next semester starts.    That way you can get back on track, he can start  making friends in the daycare, and his life can get  back on track as well.    Best wishes|`|7w2kCTDJaa	If no one in the entire family wants to take this little boy, they are all douche bags as far as I'm concerned. They don't want him, yet they only want to put you down for caring for him? Was your sister the outcast of the family or something? I can't figure out why people would rather send a relative to a foster home instead of taking him themselves.     The child probably doesn't even understand what's happened to his mother, he just doesn't have the maturity to grasp the concept of death. I suggest talking with a professional to see what you should be doing to help him cope. I think it's very admirable of you to take care of him. And I think it would do you some good to take a step back from your family for awhile. If they're not helping you, and only making you feel worse, then you don't need that right now.    I hope you get back to school soon. If you decide to raise your nephew, you'll need your education to support yourself & him. Best of luck to you.|`|thoMmZAvaa	I think your doing the best thing. Your already a mother yourself (of your own) so you have an idea of what your doing and what this child needs from you. Just try to set yourself a time line to return back to school and do your best to keep to it (maybe consider putting him in half-time sometime this year and see how he does). He does need some time to adjust to the huge changes that have occured in his life and to find his place within your family. Hopefully having a loving aunt and a cousin his own age will help him with this. I'd simply just talk to the more approachable family members and straight out ask them for more support. Explain that while you not looking for them to take care of the child with any regularity, the comments that are being made aren't helping you to be the best parent you can for him. That your trying your best to make things as good as possible for him and that you feel it's important to spend this time with him to help the two of you to bond in a parent/child way. That unfortunately now, he is and will be your child and that you need to do what you feel is right for him and that their support and encouragement will only make the process easier and more sucessful. Hopefully with some support the rest of your family will fall in line with some time. You can only do what you think is right for him as his parent, which is what your are now. Good luck.|`|gwK3ouVlaa	I have to say your doing a brill job. You family need to back off. If they don't want to help ask them  not to comment. Your family must be pretty horrible not to look after him or help. IYou seem to have a lot of will power your nephew will be grateful when he is older! Good luck xx|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think you should keep him. Don't let your family bring you down. You need to tell them "I am doing the RIGHT thing by keeping him. And if you do not like it and can not keep your opinions to yourself you do not have to be apart of our lives." Say just that. You are doing the right thing. He is the part of your sister you and the whole family have left. And they need to understand that. If that was my family telling me those things, I honestly would cut ALL ties with them.  I would not wait too long to go back to college. If I were you, I would start back in August. He will do fine in daycare, and he also will have other kids to play with and hopefully get his mind off his grief. He needs to be occupied. I am sure you are occupying him. Some people put their children in daycare for 3 half days a week. You are doing the right thing. Don't let any one give you **** about it.|`|AA11297232	What a wonderful kind and caring person you are. Your family should be proud to have you as a one of them instead of running you down  they should assist you , give you all the help they can but lets face it it is easier to sit back and criticise. If they could do better why did they not take on your Sisters child. [sorry to hear about your sister]. Please don't put him into care, you are doing well and i wish i had a sister like you. That little boy needs you and will thank you one day for what you have given up for him and doing for him. I respect people like you, give him all the love , hugs and cuddles that he needs , let those who have nothing better to do than run you down carry on with their mean selfish life's. Take care and i wish you all of the best.  By the way it is never to late to study, you are never to old. The rest of your family who all work should hang their heads in shame.|`|d5ec0d14b20f77a346c8dcc04807a042aa	You are such an amazing person.  Your nephew deserves better from your family and there is nothing you can do about that. Time may bring them around, then again maybe not.     But the fact that you are willing to make sure this little one feels loved from someone who knows him rather than pawning him off to fumble thru this whole new lifestyle is good.    As long as you love him, and are able to take care of him who cares what they think?  Right now he needs someone to show him stability and lots of love, he is so lost without his mom.   Don't do anything you are not comfortable doing for his sake, you are his parent now, you have to make the tough decisions and take the criticism, everyone has an opinion on how to raise a child.  Tell them either help or butt out they had the opportunity to take him in, you got the job so it's your call not theirs!|`|AA11737393	I think that you are very strong. Me myself I am 22 raising a 2 yr old and I was at the verge of dropping out myself because of how difficult it is and how I don't trust to many people around my daughter. But the truth is at the end of the day you cant put your life on hold because of the daycare. You should investigate the daycare and sit in and observe and then try him in a daycare for a week or so. He'll love to be around other kids his age. I think you are doing a great job and don't let anyone tell you different especially people who aren't willing to help themselves. That's sad that they rather him be with foster people rather than flesh and blood. I know its over bearing sometimes but god is not going to give you more than you can handle. Your going all this pain and your blessings are around the corner. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP!!!!!!!!

I have 4 kids (including a 9 yr old son) & what you describe sounds pretty normal to me. I swear sometimes I wonder how they will ever live on their own. I guess you just keep reminding him. I am a fan of natural consequences. For example, if he forgets to put his homework in his back pack for school, then he forgets & gets in trouble at school. If he runs out of clean socks, well too bad because you know where dirty clothes go (not on your bedroom floor!). As for washing hands & things, I do remind him to do that.

yeG5DZRAaa	I want to complement you on a couple things: First your commitment to your husband and family, A lot of people would have split by now. Secondly, you have a good grasp on the situation (weather you feel it or not) with respect to the external forces. You have identified three:    Husband and Daughter in law - Sounds like this is gaining some positive momentum, but I'm not sure about the D.I.L. How's she doing? She might fit into the counceling quite well if she'll do it. It might help her father see the secondary impacts of his behavior.    Mother - Tough one. All I can offer with this one is that she's a mom too and you know the old addage, "Mothers know best" at least in there own minds. Lay the law down with her and be frank with your emotions and need to have peace. You're a mother too and she has to see that your feelings and view point are more importent than hers on this issue. This is your family, not hers; allow you to do your job in your way. If she wont back off on the negative waves, you'll have to reduce the amount of contact with her. Tell her that. Also reiterate the displeasure with the blabing to your Brother and church friends.    Brother - Sounds to me like you're standing straight up and facing this. What's his problem? Again, tell mom to pipe down and keep him out of it if he cant be helpfull and objective.     Feel like running away? I've been there. Feeling alone with a mountain of problems and stress is the worst. I hope you have some close friends that can help. If you can, go out with them once a week for a couple hours and just have fun.
AA10351134	Pink and yellow is very sweet together. Just plan it around a white or ivory wedding. It looks wonderful with satin ribbon, light gold accents, the types of nostalgic floral patterns you see on tea cups. It can have a soft fifties flair if you want to go there. Especially nice if you let a few more pastels creep in here and there, like mint green, coral, powder blue. Great for spring or summer.

I wouldn't have two very strong colors as bold as yellow and pink can be, unless you offset it with a "grounding" color, such as soft green or ivory. If you off-set with a lot of green or ivory, you can have bright, bold colors, without it looking too much.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like the color scheme.  I think a dark pink (kinda like fuschia) and bright yellow would look terrific.  If you don't want to go that bold, how about a light soft pink with a butter yellow?  This is cheesy but at the reception you could serve pink and regular lemonade.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I am not big on using two pastels I think that is kind of dated...they remind me of early 90's weddings for some reason. If I were using these colors I would go with a deep fushia and a sunny yellow that was very soft.|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Interesting pick. Yellow can be an eyesore very easily if overdone and pink can be tricky in different lights. On top of that, they're both light colors!  Rose pink, or cherry blossom pink, and metallic gold could work. This should look like "fun", but to those who have no energy for "fun", it should just look "pleasant". It might have the side effect of "romantic" depending on how close your pink looks to salmon pink in whatever lighting.  Deep peach(not orange, more amber) and fuchsia might work nicely as well. A "warm" mix should be the outcome.  Be wary of pastel and neon combinations! They sound like Springtime colors and would probably look nice with creams and whites or soft oranges and other warm shades.  Good Luck! :)|`|47785d3bcadb0903614d430f27228819aa	I think any shade of pink would work well with a pale yellow.

You can't make yourself smile or stuff like that.  The only thing i can tell you is that perhaps if you see things with a more positive outlook then you will probably be more loving and playful.. someone very close to me alwasy tells me that cause i too be serious all the time.. so here is the key.. look at things with a more positive outlook and perhaps that will change you to what you're talking about.

Remember, just because you think you have something more exciting to talk about doesn't mean the other person will.  Try to balance out the convo.  Try to put yourself in positions where you are around lot's of people your age in a social atmosphere.  Just casually slide your way into others' convos.

2f6742406ed8e544252182e371d52bf6aa	I hope you use protection. Don't men go to prostitutes as the sex is completely uncomplicated - no call backs, no expectations? You can ask for anything and a paid girl will do most stuff for the right price?  So I'm only guessing here but do you have a problem with commitment? Casual sex requires a certain level of courtship - even if it is buying only a few drinks. You go to the brothel because you can walk in order up and walk out. Kinda like McDonald's for your sex life. You need to evaluate if you want that sort of sex or you want the positives of a more committed liaison? I don't mean kids and living together I mean breakfast in bed on a Sunday - walking, talking. Do you actually like women as people? sometimes I think men in our society concentrate on the booty call and not on the person attached. You can pay a working girl to listen to your problems but at the end of the day you know you had to pay her. A girlfriend is more than sex. A decent girl will listen and support you in your hopes and dreams. You plan together. So maybe you need to think about what you value .  If you met someone you truly value and you have self discipline you should be able to cope with just one women. As it's not just the sex you are with her for it's all the other stuff which you can't buy.  Still  some of this I'm just guessing cause I'm not a man. I know the things I value about my partner is his patience, his sense of humour, his company. Sex is a positive thing in our lives but it's not the only thing. Good luck as I really still don't understand why men frequent brothels - I've just had a  guess.|`|AA10700604	Hello g.reef,    Because the good girls don't do the stuff that the providers do.|`|5116d93de0e0a99a1fbb0a6b041739a2aa	god i must be bored|`|07e952a48d87c692f8a810576fb65e89aa	you became addicted to whore houses ?  maybe|`|f68c3674416738229da0e3f23b9f250aaa	cuz the whores are better in bed than the good girls.|`|b07347b7a570704cd2c627f04d70ccbeaa	u mean a whore|`|d2477f534a0d44cc954453f94445160daa	You're addicted to giving up the cash.|`|61155a6ca8a7764601a9c08a2db20054aa	You probably like what they do for you because the good girls won't so you just want a little taste of bad.

There's more to life then whore houses.  You obviously have some trauma in your past and you haven't identified it.  It's not normal to visit whore houses, but if sex is really what you're all about then maybe you should pursue a career in porn.   Atleast in that case you be the one getting paid for it....

Therefore-- mate with your opposite, so you kids can be the ideal: opposite of your own body shape, be it too thin or too big.    I'm a little bit chubby + I like skinny guyz cuz I don't want my [theoretical] children to have to worry about the weight issue like I do.    Conversely, skinny guys have felt self conscience about their weight all their lives, so they want to make sure their children will be a little bulkier.  The solution?  date a larger woman.  Alsoooo,  skinny guys have skinny sisters.  Big guys have big sisters.  I think ppl are repulsed by ppl that resemble their siblings.  Therefore, you'll naturally want a different body type that your genetically given one.|`|9M33dwtqaa	We look for what we don't have.

zTdp9hMFaa	Love:  Love is an incredibly powerful word. When you're in love, you always want to be together, and when you're not, you're thinking about being together because you need that person and without them your life is incomplete.    This love is unconditional affection with no limits or conditions: completely loving someone. It's when you trust the other with your life and when you would do anything for each other. When you love someone you want nothing more than for them to be truly happy no matter what it takes because that's how much you care about them and because their needs come before your own. You hide nothing of yourself and can tell the other anything because you know they accept you just the way you are and vice versa.    It's when they're the last thing you think about before you go to sleep and when they're the first thing you think of when you wake up, the feeling that warms your heart and leaves you overcome by a feeling of serenity. Love involves wanting to show your affection and/or devotion to each other. It's the smile on your face you get when you're thinking about them and miss them.    Love can make you do anything and sacrifice for what will be better in the end. Love is intense,and passionate. Everything seems brighter, happier and more wonderful when you're in love. If you find it, don't let it go.|`|uQBNrEAuaa	I'm still trying to figure that out |`|1yWxUZWMaa	Love is only an accidental consecuence of too much lust, but it does feel nice and could last forever.|`|oe9rgxhZaa	Love is all about Love.|`|af5b4de68cf98b9ed1a39c0b03216e47aa	sometimes love is good and sometimes it not. but me.

ec046c5394dac4efd53e6da8c6462708aa	You are probably shy and won't let yourself loosen up enough to have a good time. Most girls worth meeting usually wait for the guy to make the first move. Subconsciously, you may be feeling rejected by girls not approaching you and it puts a damper on your mood. Then you feel like going home. Read up on some body language books to make sure you are making your self look approachable to the opposite sex, us girls are finely tuned to pick up on a guy's body language and whether or not we feel he is someone we care to approach. If you are too shy to make the first move, buy a girl a drink and asked the waitress to tell her that you found her interesting and that the drink was from you. Most women will at the very least come to the man and thank them for the drink as It always works with me, and then you may start your conversation from there. Say something like I find you very interesting or compliment her on a nice feature and introduce yourself. Good luck and have fun!|`|kMMqnWEAaa	i know what you mean, i am on the other end of this.  i want to go out and meet guys, but when it comes down to it, i chicken out.  let me know when you get a good answer, so i can figure out why i do it too|`|AA10860112	sounds like you want the relationship without having to do the work to get one? yes?|`|66821855b0d24b5783848c81bb17c8a4aa	im not a guy but I would say you're fairly content with the life you have but you THINK you should be out getting girls, just relax, enjoy sports or whatever it is, and the right girl will pop up when you least expect it,|`|6fe070b9f470d901c00fa7e2f19239b3aa	I know exactly what you mean, and mnay guys go through this. You don't talk to them when your out because you don't know how to work the dating game yet. Which, first, you don't know how to approach them without coming off lame. Secondly, you're not sure how to break the ice with interesting conversation. Third, your not sure how to handle rejection when and if it happens. Fourth, you may not know how to get involved in a relationship or a date without getting too attached too quickly. So because of these worries, you don't talk to them. You get bored and go home, then think about girls again and wish you had said something to one.     That is the essence of the dating game. Learn how to do these things, and you will be able to stay out there and work it, and get numbers and dates.|`|AA12318060	It sounds like u would like someone to share  your free time with, but u also enjoy being alone.

If you go out with the intention to meet a woman, you could probably meet 10.      If your going out with the intention to hook up with your next life love: You're going home alone!      Go out to meet people.  Cool, nice, genuine people.  Male, female or other.  Meet even more people through the people you meet.  Maybe there's a girl or guy in that group that you could be interested in?  Maybe one of the people you meet will have someone they want you to meet or be interested in you.      You should be going out to have fun & meet new people, not to hook up and find a relationship.      Good Luck|`|zuw3QhDQaa	your soft.. and you will die a virgin... no im kidding.. just grow some balls|`|AA11308330	Thing is you are "scared" of rejection, but the thing is you'll never know if you dont try. Come on ask that chick you been eyeing from down the end of the bar.room.  The worst that could happen is that she says no, but dont let that hold you back. This doesnt mean to be too persistent that its annoying, just kinda balance it out.     Also, before you make your move, look at body language and see if you too caught her eye, if she smiles, then prepare for final approach.|`|f247da346a0526252e853f6533c9bbdaaa	I guess you are shy!  Why don't start working on this little by little.  Before you go out, set yourself a goal.  For example: tonight I will approach one girl, say hi, one or two comments about the place, the people or about her, introduce myself and ask her name.  once you succeed at that, you set a greater task, such as specifically let her know that you got interested and would like to get her number.  By practicing, you will feel more comfortable and secure. Eventually it will come natural.  I suggest that in the beginning you choose girls that you are not really interested in.  Remember, it is just for practice. Once you are comfortable, you will be able to approach those girls you really like without fear.  We always get Nos, it is part of life, but what really counts is the Yeses that come once in a while!  good luck|`|e8dcbbdb9f4c6267514dc562bf234213aa	wish you are my ffriend, try to be smart boy.

Happens every day.  But that is the difference between a man and a boy.      Its good that you notice the difference, but this is your problem, you can't find a man if you start giving it up for free to boys.  Gotto keep them legs close together if you want to find a real man someday.

That's the best way to go.|`|2086cc9ecae14aa788195f3a60d98e4daa	You can buy inexpensive trimmers for the bikini line at almost any drug store. Try doing it yourself. That way you can trim it a little bit at a time until you get it where you want it. That's what I do. That way, you don't have the stubbly regrowth that causes an uncomfortable itch from shaving completely.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	First, best wishes for your upcoming marriage. Second, congratulations for sticking to your beliefs and saving yourself for the right person. And last, there is absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about at all. Ask a friend or someone at school or work if they have a salon they recommend. If not, look around where you live and find a salon that looks nice. Make an appointment and tell them you would like to have a bikini wax. When you go in for your appointment, explain to the person waxing you that you have never had this done before and you're not quite sure what to ask for.  They will tell you about the different kinds of waxes available and they will take care of all other areas, such as trimming.   I would recommend getting this done one to two days before the wedding so that it will last through the honeymoon without stubble. And don't worry or be embarrassed: the estheticians who perform waxes do this all day, every day. There's nothing you can say that they haven't heard before and everyone has to go in for the first time sometime.   Also, check and see if the tip is included. Most nicer places include a tip of 15-20% in the cost of the wax. If this is the case, then you tip the esthetician a few dollars on top of that. If the tip is not included, then the average tip is between 10-20% of the cost of the wax, depending on where you live (larger tip in urban areas).   Good luck and God Bless.|`|iRVUVwP7aa	If you have strong religious beliefs then don't do anything sexual. If you are not strongly religious and your husband is also not strongly religious then both of you take off all your clothes, vests, and underwear. Then you kiss him on the lips and see his reaction.|`|lmmuLdVEaa	do what feels right to you, but my wife asked me to shave it for her, "what a turn on for me", now i do it once a week for her, i even shaved it into a love heart once, Mmm nice, have a good day and good luck to you both..
a9WLeAHPaa	yes|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	he drinks too much, spends too much time with friends, calls at the wrong times, and probably is seeing someone else just like himself.|`|8d9d7cc2b7898928f300f6af361fbdd2aa	You should call him and tell him how you feel and ask him why he has not contacted you.     Life is what you make it not what others make it for you,  get out there and take from life what it offers.    Good luck and god bless.|`|6NI5zOcFaa	maby you got lucky and he blacked out who you are. find a new friend thats not a drunk|`|3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	get on with your life. how much idle time have you wasted worring about this??? you spend that energy on one who needs you|`|8d869cdbbc071557f08a7bef26e08dc1aa	looks like a loser to me.  Don't waste any more time wtih him.|`|aoT8vMGDaa	Not to sound harsh or anything but it doesn't seem like he was ever ready for anything. he used you for rides home ... you guys didn't sound official. and let me tell you something ... anyone can say i love you. it sounds like he never went out of his way for you. you went out of your way. he loves you so much that he doesn't call you to see how you are doing. and if your intuition is telling you that he might not be ready for this then dont insist ... let him go and move on.|`|KqP9nUmnaa	call him and c if he wants to go out but its okay maybe he just needs space or needs to hangout wit guys|`|izdiP6EEaa	find someone betta he sounds like a scrub|`|ykBHuFMOaa	No..

He is in his party stage, where he doesnt want to be tied down.  Its the "Bros before Hoes" stage.  We all go through it.  You are more mature than him, and you are looking for something he is not.  He is not ready for you.  It may take a while, but eventually he will grow up and realize its time to settle down, thats when you walk back into his life.  Until then, dont show him that you htink about him all the time, but let him know your still around.  Dont kiss his butt, or ask him to do things.  Just enjoy life, and try to move onto the next stage, responsible young adult.  That will make you more attractive in his eyes.|`|16b9599ec81c649b8eb96f0aeb90cd5eaa	If you think he's a waste of time then why talk to him?  you need to find something new.  Maybe you should hold off from dating for a while until you find out what you need.  You're not going to die if you're single.  independence it beautiful.  enjoy it!  Good luck and Happy Valentine's Day!  [?]

Try just holding back and wait to see what he does & to see if he really does have a gf. But don't go out of your way to avoid him. Just talk to him as you would to anyone else.
c073e53821f74804ba4490fab8f73b91aa	Here is my thought -- they don't count in the way that you fall in love.  You can FALL in love with someone without considering those factors, it's true.      But can you make a relationship LAST for many years without considering those factors?  That's another thing entirely.    I was married to a Middle Eastern man, with a completely different culture, religion, parental upbringing, societal norms, etc. etc.  Polar opposites, we were.  Our ages were similar, in number, but not in personality.  He acted like he was years older than me.      I overlooked all those factors as being insignificant because we were "in love."  And I couldn't make it work.  The first 10 years were spend with my learning how his culture worked, and how not to upset his family.  The next 10 years were spent begging forgiveness for all the times I messed up, and praying that he would somehow find it in his heart to let me off the hook.  He didn't.    After I learned to forgive myself, I realized that I didn't have to live like that and feel terrible all the time for something that I couldn't help.  I loved that culture, but there was no way I could be something I wasn't. I would never be Middle Eastern, because I was born in Tennessee!!  I would always be blonde,  and blue eyed, and speak with an accent.    It matters in the long haul, and if there is a significant difference in your age, it will even matter more.  You can love someone forever, but living day to day is a completely different thing. Someone has to give up their way of life, and they will end up resenting it eventually...|`|tZpwWp3Saa	No. My love and I are both of diffferent cultures and while same religion, very diffferent intensities.|`|AA12253534	no but i like to count it|`|2e0d7279ae4d49dee7510e36a0a4d4aeaa	That's a big yes. Love is a choice. You can fall in love with just about anyone and anything. People have. What you want for a happy life and stable relationship is some compatibility. As you age together and have kids, these issues become more and more important.|`|0f5ba528addf76bc731f7bde39b77850aa	It all depends on opinion...|`|f3a40122899b6f2a86d9a302fc6ec93caa	age does but culture and religion don't|`|AA11545874	Age - It's something which depends on everyones opinion sometimes people dont think they shuld like people older to them r younger but some time they dont but the truth is TRUE LOVE never wonders about the persons age but just the person him/her self.    Culture and Religion might be a bigger thing cos sometimes people have different believes and they follow different things and it counts as a major point cos sometimes what u might be doing may not be right in his/ her culture or religion but when people try to get along setting aside their differences and understanding each other it can be easily sorted out.
FYcIgD7Faa	you're adorable!  Seriously, I think you're very very cute! If I had the chance, I'd definitely love to go out with you!  I don't know why you think you need a makover! Maybe a pair of glasses as you can't see yourself too well!  You're very pretty indeed, & whichever guy finally does go out with you, will be one lucky chap!|`|AA12169870	You are an average looking girl.    As for going out with you, let me answer indirectly through this quote:    "Things always seem to appear more well-divine through a thin glass of wine better when one turns his/her head to the other side.  Therefore he/she may turn blind to avoid from being put in the spot light."    However you want to interpret this is up to you.    Good luck!|`|3bbaa47e0cfe3ac70149b3ea53041db2aa	You're a very sexy girl! Hell yeah I'd go out with you!|`|AA11853350	i luv that last picture...it reminds me of this one middle school girl|`|08c421325ffac3663047dbf9bec6c2b7aa	Drop dead gorgeous, im serious you are id go out with you..heck id dump my girlfriend for you lol|`|da69c5cef902f255e6c3c057da414379aa	Hi ya there, your a very pretty girl but to even make your face shine more is a good haircut! That's what I did. Show your face to the world sistah!|`|7xmr9c9naa	I think you look good! Dont let you looks bring you down! Its really whats on the inside, but they usually go for your eyes, its like a mirror of who you really are!!!|`|90fc938f5149d9fcb1683e3246ed549caa	girl u dont need a makeover u look fine they way u r|`|d4a29d6eae5ad005378741da4c3feec7aa	Stay the way you are girl|`|6dfwnqDDaa	u don't need a make over u look B.

95f078ea7d11192207a5cbc225861070aa	yes, follow your heart and find out the truth. Its obvious that you like her and not knowing if she likes you is driving you NUTS!!! Don't play games the next time you see her speak introduce yourself again and invite her and her friend out to coffee or lunch(with other people their it wont feel so awkward) be open be honest and be YOU. good luck|`|492b727a1ef68dcf20c09134fff2224baa	just go up 2 her and ask her bout all this and why shes ignorin u. find out how she feels. say like is it the facebook thin or somthin else. if its goin good, tell her u like her and wanna get 2 know her more and ask her if she wanna hang out wit u somtime. if she says yes then ur golden, if no, hey, its her loss.|`|fUU43QEEaa	talk to her(if she responds them she accepcded u insted of rejecting u)  gd luck|`|b74dfb6f55186377a5a2d3b39d8d6db9aa	u realy should just e-mail her or talk to her say look im not good at these things but i like you and would like to know you more if there is a reason she is ignoring you there may be a reason like.... maybe her friend likes you. TALK TOI HER!!!!!!|`|mhyXvng7aa	okay the thing i think u should do is to just confront her but dont seem nervous girls like confidence so that would add extra points for u through her eyes     when u confront her ask her straight up dont play games she will hate that|`|3d29b3c5add26506676d0872c7b6f4b3aa	Just ask start a conversation with her. If she talks to you, she's at least somewhat interested....|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	Dude, just go to her and say hi. She knows you're nervous and she's probably nervous about you coming to her too. It's okay.    Don't wait around too long or else someone else will come along and catch her eye.|`|mk0EQMLvaa	i guess starting up again with a ..  "hey remember me? how you been?"  would suffice.    just be light on your toes  and confidant.  dont approach her too much but if  you do make eyecontact a little later that day,  [after saying hello]  wave!  or if its ben a while, ask about her previous classes.    there are a bundle of things to talk about.  good luck with her :]
553Ak9fcaa	I don't know about the rest of the women out there, but I would much rather have a guy tell me that he is not in love with me nor interested that all he wanted was sex and that was it.      Then to waste my time with a half of a man that does not have the guts to tell me that he is just using me and in top of that telling me that he loves when he doesn't mean it.  Just so you know you are not making love you are having sex.    Dude there is plenty of woman out there that would do it with you for money but then maybe you don't have any.|`|4564f02c4b8435c89f69b1cfa2aa44daaa	She must be waiting for a ring or something. Let her go so she can find somebody who wants to be with her.|`|eba9bfdb7318f700d65868f6d9507a7aaa	That's disgusting.  Next time have some balls to tell her that she was only a one night stand and that he just wanted a piece of @ss.  I'd lay into her, but he told her I love you and is holding onto false hope.  2 years?  That makes me sick.  Grow some nads and be a real man by not having sex just to have sex.  Ugh!|`|AA11622808	You are like a lot of guys, you are not honest and you think with your penis and not your head. Well, then again.|`|2f5a09e0087f5187260f757935a57195aa	You are a nasty person.    Why say something if you do not mean it!|`|90b9340048d9f6fe1e6110fa043eb4b7aa	If you feel that why there's nothing wrong with that. That's your right. But it's not your right to lie to someone and they believe it. It's not right for you to waste someone else life and time with lien that's not fair. If you don't love this person that's OK there's no wrong or right to it. You said if you would of left her she would be sad, but don't you think she real be more sad now that she shared time with you and you got her believing lies.I know you care for her as a human being have the courage to tell her now before she gets pregnant that you want out in you feel it's not working out for you. You need to own up to your real feelings. It's really not fear to waste someone else time. Life is to short. Read ten stupid things men do to mess up their lives by Dr. Laura C. Schlessinger. Now go do the right thing.

48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	I think you just pretty much explained it.  When you're single and miserable, you send out single and miserable signals.  Therefore, nothing worthwhile happens.  When you're in a relationship you send out the "happy I'm in a relationship" signals and that's like honey for the male bees to conquer.  Something about going after something unattainable really gets the juices flowing.  Positive energy brings back positive results and negative energy brings back nothing......|`|71ynGaowaa	haha Amen sister|`|OzynpFfmaa	never happend to me *cries*|`|nWgTur4qaa	I'm guessing it's the glow in their faces??

Don't blame yourself for his behavior.|`|qloHZccvaa	It may just be that he doesn't know how to deal with something like this. I would think if he was really feeling the relationship and serious about there that he would be there for you 100% in your time of need. I would question his intentions...
tDZeUlUwaa	I'm currently reading a book dealing with this same situation. I think that yes, the wreck did scare him and now he realizes how close he was to loosing you both. He probably feels like he can't protect you enough. Maybe afraid of making a commitment only to loose it. Confront him about how you feel he is growing distant. If you let time continue, the gap will only grow bigger. Good luck!|`|qZ1lRAbqaa	He's probbaly being honest i wonder the same bout my bf he tells me the same thing and its just been 2 months of going out......... and he goes without tlakin very much or even seein me and he just says he has alot to deal with right now..............     good luck to u but if u love him them wait and c it through most likely he does care guys do that alone thing so well its what they r use to........

Si tu vas dire  quelqu'un que tu l'aimes et qu'il ne rponds rien, qu'en concluerais-tu ?    Il est revenu  la charge plusieurs fois et tu ne lui as rien dit. L est le problme car tu aurais pu lui dire que tu veux plus le conna?tre avant de t'engager ou quelque chose comme ?a...    Maintenant, le fait qu'il te regarde toujours fait qu'il tient encore  toi. Je supposes aussi qu'il n'a pas voulu quitter sa petite amie pour se retrouver tout seul...    Il doit t'aimer je pense mais il s'est dcourag de te demander  chaque fois et sans obtenir de rponses. En plus son ami qui est venu te voir  du lui dire que c'tait mort puisqu'il l'a envoy en claireur...    Le problme c'est que si tu n'as pas envie de lui demander il ne viendra plus non plus car aprs toutes les vestes qu'il pense avoir pri...    Alors si tu l'aimes, courage et va lui dire. Maintenant, comme il est avec sa petite amie ?a va tre plus difficile.    Passes alors par son meilleur pour lui dire ce que tu ressens ou du moins pour sonder car il se peut que son ami connaisse ses penses...

Yo soy muy romantica , siempre lo he sido , me gusta complacer y hacer sentir bien al a persona , mostrando mi afecto , aun que hay a veces que me reselvo las cosas como algunos hacemos por miedo a una herida del amor etc...    Mira primero que nada algo muy valioso y que habla por si slo es darle una mirada directamente a los ojos de tu enamorado , dicen que la mirada es el reflejo de su alma , y dicen mas que mil palabras , los abrazos , palabras , besos , caricias no tiene que ver con caricias para excitar al a persona ,eso es aparte , , yo creo que cuando uno muestra su afecto lo hace de diferentes formas y dependiendo con quien ..      1) Un regalo     2) Escuchar y aconsejar    3) Escribirle un poema no tiene que ser de tu propia inspiracin , lo importante es el detalle .    4) Hacer una cena , con una vela y una rosa en el centro de la mesa .    5) Ir a la playa en la noche y mirar las estrellas .    6) Hacerle caricias y hablarle con cari?o , mimarlo .    7) Decirle lo importante que es para ti ..    8) El apoyo es muy importante eso significa que te importa .    9) Darle un masaje .    10) Decile Te quiero o Te amo lo que sientes sin miedo , sin ataduras , ser libre en tus palabras .      ?Crees que las personas nacen romanticas ?  No uno lo aprende lo deja salir , yo nac en un ambiente fuerte , y nada de romantisismo y sin embargo yo lo soy , es cuestin de conocerte a ti misma , de soltarte completamente , debes empezar tu misma escribiendolo en un papel (libreta) lo que sientes por cada persona , si se te hace difcil decirselo personalmente dejale esa nota , lo importante es que la otra persona lo sepa ..

73cb039952ad6950d2aa03da91eb849eaa	I think that the husband's friend is  VERY immature.  However, there is nothing your friend can do, only her husband can. He will have to be the one to put his foot down and tell the friend to back off a little...or a lot.  It would be a shame if he allowed his friend to mess up his marriage.|`|Ql14oew2aa	i woud say he is gay possibly he hate to lose his friend that they use to do stuff together|`|d4d03341fb4b9a635379680fcd19aabdaa	he could be gay............... or he could have no life now since his freind is busy alot and wants to have a life, so if he's not gay, help him get a life so he will have other things to do|`|d974f7d9872614e12db344d3a90d6950aa	would explain a lot if he came out of the closet! don't answer the phone...

Nothing slutty.   I would go with summer casual, yet stylish.    A tee-shirt and flip flops are too informal.   Wear a cute sophiscated summer top and some wedge sandals.|`|fhO2B84Xaa	My sister wore a top like this over jeans to our party the night before my wedding, and looked adorable.

d1HdJGAsaa	Don't hurt a friend like that...it's not worth it.  Stay friends with your friend's ex but don't stay too close with him.

Good Luck,  *girlygirl* 24/7|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	Some people won't be happy about the fact that a friend dating an ex because they may think the friend was the reason for the breakup.    Personally, I say there's nothing wrong with it, especially if you allow some time to pass by before you two start dating each other. Your argument of "just because they didn't work out doesn't mean it can't with us" is a valid one.    Sometimes the people we date simply aren't for us to be with.|`|YyMLMUYFaa	No, thats never right. The only way it would be acceptable is if you dated him without knowing they used to talk and then found out later. It will make it look like you were always interested and just waiting for them to end. And she will never look at you the same either.   There are so many guys out there... dont loose a friendship over just one of them.|`|OhFS98Eyaa	Very  Take this word of help lol  Don't do it at all  i did that and we have never talked to eachother for 10 years!  and heres the thing  he might not like you he could just be using you to make her jealous  So does that help   i hope that the best answer to you lol|`|zJFyWXzpaa	bad idea

GQzlF0mTaa	Its hard to think any young teen like you would be actually seriously in love or know what's the real meaning of love. I usually think teens dont know what love really is, but i know there are some kids like your age that do. However, you cant really judge kids wheter they know love or not because most of them are just experimenting love in relationships, not every kid knows what they're suppose to do. Teen relationships usually never last for a long time. Young teens are not fully matured yet, especially boys, so we think teens in relationships play games and have a lot of pointless drama in realtionships. Then some careless teens have sex, without thinking clearly through.    Adults will know what's the meaning of love because they have experience from lots of relationships. They know whats real love because they've gone through painful experiences.|`|435390163a4e541b09d69e6930758316aa	15  is young.to be seriously in love when you have your hole life to go. see if you can cool it a little|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	Because kids your age don't know the full concept of what love is. At your age, yall's hormones are in overdrive and yall are really just experiencing those feelings associated with lust and love...and yall can't really tell the two apart. Since folks your age really don't know what love is, how can you really say you are in love?    Also, many people who are together in high school don't stay together when they graduate because once they get out of school, they meet other people and become want to date them.    So don't go around saying you're in love. You really have no experience with it. When you graduate and get on your own, you'll have a better grasp of what it is.|`|51c4ff8fca7798e711a5ba0af235b2b2aa	of course you have the right to love someone   and those who dont support you must have some problem and     now what youcan do i to just focus on you love     but remember family comes before love so becareful       don't dosomething so that ou loose your family|`|yVYoHVUKaa	Everyone is so rude. to everyone.|`|625f44d7e56d01bc8ce915828e501898aa	It's probably because these adults think that they are "experienced" and have "lived through it." I totally agree with you. There is no age for love. I guess they just don't want kids these days falling in love at an age way before they did, or they don't think that kids are responsible enough to handle it.
R0yL5edSaa	a volte capita anche a me...e penso che comunque su questo incide la routine della vita, piano piano fa stabilizzare l'amore e questo non  molto buono perch potrebbe subentrare l'apatia.

2OMZZh38aa	Talk to her and tell her how you feel.  Hopefully by the end of the conversation you will know what's up between you 2 so you can sttop thinking about her and get on with your life.  Life is too short to be in the situation you are in right now.  Talk to her.|`|0dfde5bed81c3f7d176f4040974b4b24aa	just talk to her first|`|AA11617366	ok honestly,be yourself..... dont be one of those wanna be popular jerks,because she will think your a jerk.so be yourself,be nice to her    i think thats the only advice i could give you.|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Sounds to me like you're already friends and need a little more confidence in yourself.  Why not ask her out right now??  Wouldn't you rather know now then later.  What happens if you go all out in just being her friend and then find out later that someone else asks her out and you waited too long to pull the trigger.  Ask her now and if she says no then move on to someone else.  Girls like the guys that take action.   Good Luck!!|`|RUZ3Isoyaa	be real to her, be yourself, if u gt a chance to meet her again, say something like.."Hey, its been a while since we talk... how's everything for ya?"     Be sincere!    Good Luck~|`|0cIbdaCPaa	Just be yourself. If you are sweet and caring, and you sound like you already possess these qualities, she'll come to realise how lucky she is to have a friend like you. Don't sweat the waiting game. If you wait too long - someone else will beat you to the punch. Just go talk to her. Ask  her what's up, long time no speak ... you know friendly stuff.     If she likes you she'll respond. Don't think badly of yourself if you don't feel gorgeous. Looks arent everything and a lot of gorgeous guys out there are horrible to girls.     Most girls deep down want a nice decent guy. But they need excitement - so the thrill of a bad boy but not really a bad boy. So play a little hard to get. Keep the excitement. Don't be too all over her or you'll scare her away.    After you give her time to get the message that you asked whats up? Wait a couple days (at least a week) then try once more. If she responds to you while talking thesecond time ask her to coffee or something small - like a movie. If she doesn't respond back off. Give her space and time. Then try once more. If by that time no response you may have to wait a really long space before trying again (I'm talking like a month).|`|gkttLct1aa	Find another girl. There are too many out there. Stop wasting your time.|`|AA10947675	Tell her you miss the time that ya'll used to talk together.That you want your friendship back.|`|405e55575cf64d94ff2b9f66a3e8eb00aa	its often said that honesty is the best policy. try telling her exactly how you feel (leaving out some of the more intimate of your desires, i.e. wanting to date her). let her know you miss her friendship and you don't know where it went wrong. really sugar it up but you seem genuine enough anyway so don't worry too much. if she doesnt react or doesn't understand and continues to do what she's doing then you're experiencing life. a shitty part of life but life nonetheless. friends leave friends behind all the time. take what you've learned from her and the experience and apply it to your future friendships. i know its hard to think you could like another girl, that none can compare to her, but your heart will move on. just give it time. patience is a virtue for a damn good reason. and, if things work out for you, be still cautious of the past and be aware that it can all change in a moment. good luck.|`|IlCa2B1yaa	well talk to her buy using your cellphone maybe,  you know friendship is good in our life it can prevent us to be more lonely i mean someone we can share our happiness, i know that love begins in a close friendship so thats why you need to be more close at her, sometimes that is not our reason so we have to get closer, but to have someone we make happy!!|`|7Ir88vumaa	you know what? i think you really didnt lose your friendship with her. it's just all in your mind, maybe u might be thinking that bcoz of her status you dont fit to be her friend anymore.. if i were you, stop thinking about that.. you said, both of you are really good friends before, then there's no problem.. as long as both of you can still feel the same way with one another.. if you are really good friends then her becoming so popular and you just an ordinary guy, will not matter.. stop thinking that you are a nobody, because if she really treats you as her friend, then she will never take your friendship for granted.. talk to her.. tell her you miss her, you miss the friend u have known before.. and im sure she will listen!

I do understand your feelings because if you were to marry your girlfriend, you would have to interact with her daughter on a regular basis.    Since it's bothering you that much, you need to let your girlfriend know how you honestly feel and how the situation affects you and the relationship. If she can't acknowledge your feelings, then I suggest you take a step back in your relationship.

Be careful to whom u love because they might break ur heart. But if he's doing his part which is making YOU happy, then don't be afraid, give it a chance sweety|`|FxhFz4d2aa	I'msorry about that i know how you feelthe same thing happen to me just try to get over him i know its hard but the best thing to do is go on with your life dont let a guy take it from you|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	just do it|`|5PDPJMlYaa	love won't develop that quickly. i'm pretty sure he didn't love you to begin with and just said that.    falling in love is a childish term. adults don't exactly "fall in love". it's usually used to describe a thought of being with someone.

The one thing that you must remember is that if you ever really want a relationship to ever work out, always be honest.    He will probably contact you now after receiving the news.  Explain to him how you felt at the time, and why you never told him, this should clear the air a little     Good luck|`|7a97978aa2a2d43f7204880e3731b4e8aa	Not good.|`|AA10276782	If he wants to be with you, he will call you, no big deal.

If you are really into him then be persistent but not annoying.  give him some time but clear up that phone call business quick.|`|ffQL4DoAaa	If he was truly feeling you minus the b...ness then I feel that it will do more good than harm. He might ask why you didn't say what was wrong while you were together but if he enjoyed your company when you weren't being a jerk, your aunts explanation will help. UNLESS he is in fact a jerk himself, and in this case you saved yourself the drama, because if a man can't be with you at your worse then he doesn't deserve to experience your best...|`|moisnaoMaa	Probably not good, he will think you put her up to it... He's a grown man, he should be willing to support you thru hard times and then be able to talk to you about your actions and attitude with out walking away.
5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa	I honestly don't think you can love a person you don't know, but I defintitely believe in infatuation and lust. I think you are infatuated with her. That can lead to love possibly. I say just take a chance. Ask her out and then you'll know if she's interested in you romantically. You'll never know if you don't just take that chance. Hopefully she'll feel the same...best of luck to you.|`|XbsosVMmaa	the answer to both questchings is 28    APRIRL FOOLZL!!!!

If it was me I'd give her little hints here and there so she knows you have a small interest for her. A while back a girl asked me who I thought was the hottest girl in school. I told her "In my eyes there's only one girl for me..and that is you!" and now she's my girlfriend!! Good luck! (Hope I don't Jinx you..)|`|qVMg9YRsaa	Like, Lust, Infactuation, Love...I think you are infactuated with what you know, but I don't see signs of love. Only the potential. Take your time...
AA11622808	Just drop a few hints to them. Or be brave, you ask one of them out.  Good luck , sweetie.|`|OMFhLGWlaa	WELL I THINK YOU SHOULD KIND DO SOMETHING TO THEM SO ONE OF THEM WILL REALIZE YOU LIKE HIM AND DATE YOU BUT BE CAREFUL SO BOTH OF THEM DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU
f8f38fe4da2245888fb408dcbce98d10aa	I don't think you were even in love with him to begin with.  I think he's wasting his time trying to please someone who obviously doesn't care about him.  Let him go.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	it sound like you cant fal back in love with him, you were never  in love in the first place it sound. and that not good you need  to be honest iwth him about how you feel. talk to someone  so that you can  fiqure out what you need to know, he deserve  to be with some one that love  that appreicate and love him.|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	unfortunantly, yes..i'm back with first hubby..ugh|`|AA11622808	If you are not in love with him.....get out...I know how you must feel. I have been there before. I hated my ex husband, I eventually walked out. I am sure you will find some one else. Stay positive and take care.|`|AA10378323	Take a step back, maybe you need a break from him.  If you would really like to work things out maybe you should go to counseling.  If he really loves you and want things to work he will do it, and maybe you can find your love for him again.    But if you never really loved him, you are just waisting each others time.  You can't make yourself or anyone else fall in love.  It is better to be alone and happy than with someone and miserable.|`|38b0fdfb5947afc7b709833185e5e687aa	IF HE,S A GREAT GUY_ AND IT JUST ISNT WORKING AND U TREAT HIM THAT WAY( U MAY HAVE SOME UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT NEED RESOLVED,  U ALREADY SAID U HATE THE PERSON U HAVE BECOME    WE ALL NEED TO HAVE SOME THING TO BE EXCITED OVER, SOME TIMES IT,S NOT ALWAYS A PERSON, AND SOME TIMES IT IS  *** SOME TIMES A BALLANCE OF BOTH""  BEING ALONE IS HARD  BUT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT BECOMES A CONSTANT HASTLE   MAYBE LAY IT BACK" FIND YR HAPPY ZONE AND FLOW''|`|h8rIK8Q2aa	Sounds like me. I have the same problem.|`|Y60fiSYxaa	I would suggest counseling. You should get some counseling for just you and counseling for both of you together.     If you can't afford to pay for counseling then I would suggest a local church. If you are a member then usually the priest will do it for free.    However, it may not be that you don't love him. There may be a different reason that you are feeling this way, so I would try to figure that out first and then maybe the rest will fall in place.    You say that ya'll didn't date, so maybe try to start that. Have a date night every week. Just try to spend some time together. If you know and acknowledge how you are treating him, then try to change it. Try to be nicer and try to do things that you know will make him happy. Try to focus on that for awhile instead of on what he is doing to make you unhappy.    My husband and I try to do things every day that we know will make the others life easier and happier. It changes things a lot when you put someone else's happiness in front of your own.    Good Luck - I hope everything works out for the two of you.|`|c75a6cbc1250dc344213b804332b1a90aa	I think its you who need scrutinizing not your spouse, you say he is a great guy who loves you and treat you right, then i wonder what else you would be looking in any other man. The big question is did you before the six months love him and felt good when with him, you said you never dated, then it happened that you started living together like a married couple. And is there someone else you are into, or maybe your ex( you maybe comparing them) Sorry but i think you yourself is the problem here.

No es lo mismo tener un novio que un esposo. Un noviazgo es una relacion que te permite conocer a una persona en un plano mas personal que una relacion de amigos. Esta relacion es sumamente importante porque conoces a un chico, sus sentimientos, su forma de pensar, su forma de tratarte, (con amor y respeto), etc. Saber estas cosas son las que te van a ayudar a decidir si l es el hombre con el cual quieres pasar el resto de tu vida. No hablo de que tengan relaciones sexuales, pienso que eso se debe de dar dentro del matrimonio, no antes. Lo que te digo es que muchas veces nos dejamos llevar por las apariencias y vemos a un muchacho bonito y pensamos que es el hombre de nuestros sue?os y resulta que es el patn mas grande del universo. Sin embargo un muchacho que no es muy guapo pero que tiene hermosos sentimientos, nos hacen sentir especial y nos respetan; Eso amiga vale oro. Pero como vas a conocer a alguien si no se dan una oportunidad de estar juntos, salir, compartir y descubrir los intereses de cada cual.     Mi consejo es que te des una oportunidad con este muchacho que te gusta y que tu le gustas a l. Sean novios, conozcanse mejor, conversen y compartan juntos momentos lindos. Esta primera experiencia es bien bonita, todo es nuevo, mgico, como ese primer beso que te dieron.     Otro consejito: Nosotras las mujeres somos las que tenemos el control. Siempre recuerda esto: Un hombre llega hasta donde la mujer se lo permite. Si siempre te mantienes al margen y no permites caricas indebidas no tendras porque preocuparte. Siempre hazle saber a l que para ti es importante que te respete. Si por alguna razon el no lo comprende as y continua insistiendo, lo mejor ser que lo mandes a volar.     Te deseo exito y muchas felicidades en la relacion con tu novio. No pierdas la oportunidad de conocer a alguien especial.|`|c0e46b36cf027cc8291a5c2ead064543aa	No es tu novio, solo un chico que te beso...   Me parece excelente el consejo de pedro I, que no la vea tan facil...para la proxima vez si el o alguien mas te quiere besar sin ser tu novio, ponte fuerte y dificil porque si empiezas asi luego van a querer un beso mas largo, una caricia por aqui y alla... y despues cosas que tu estas muy chica para saber. Asi que te cuidas, a tu edad esas cosas son lindas y  emocionantes, pero si no sabes cuando poner un alto vas a tener problemas. date a respetar.|`|NRj9sZ7yaa	Si eres cristiana te aconsejo que primero busques de las cosas de Dios el te revelara en un sueno quien ba hacer tu esposo si el o otra persona si tu no haces la voluntad de Dios te ira mal en la vida.|`|f482ff7585b90987a8270b7eb1f86dc5aa	no hasta q el te diga QUIERES SER MI NOVIA por el momento son amigos cari?osos|`|PyBmPnBFaa	eso creo que se lo tienes que preguntar a el no se que tradiciones tenga el, pero preguntaselo asi no te haras ilusiones que tal si solo queria un picorete|`|dKT6aorvaa	No cielo no es tu novio, un beso no es ser novios, eso es un principio de rollete, si te gusta sigue vindole y disfruta porque con esa edad que tu tienes es cuando se empieza a tener los primeros besos... puede que solo te cases una sola vez pero antes estars con  mas personas ya lo veras cuando seas mas mayor, si estas hecha un lo no pienses, disfruta y deja pasar el tiempo aver que pasa, si te das cuenta de que no te gusta con no besarle mas tienes bastante, andate con ojo que los chicos de 16 tienen mucha picarda,,,saludos|`|ae0571a53452c802b38fddda909d48f7aa	pues yo creo que deberia spreguntarselo a el...|`|37d2aaa9a4e953af74f2d6f8cd7f92b3aa	Mientras el no te diga que si quieres ser su novia eres solo amiguita cari?osa y vete despacito estas abriendo los ojos a una sensacin nueva y extra?a que se llama amor y debes irte muy despacito, para que identifiques la linea muy delgada entre el amor y el deseo a tu edad se uno muy rpido cuidadito.|`|ZQLU3rm1aa	no mientras el no te lo haya pedido o dicho.

B8byrNV8aa	Okay im going to try my best to make this short and simple. Alright love to me is the most best thing that could happen to any one other than waking up to another day and being alive. Love is when you think about that special someone every day and night. That when you think about that person all you can do is just smile that you cant help your self. That you feel comfortable around them that you dont ahve to be spme one that you arent that that person fell in love with who you are not what you are. Also that you can tell him/her anything. That when you know that you are about to see that person you cant help but get butterfly's in you stomach that also your heart skips a beat. Also when you kiss its the best feeling ever. That also when you kiss nothing else is on your mind but that you are with that person and that person is with you. Thats not all it doesnt even have to be when you are kissing him/her and can just being with that person nothing else matters.Now last but noo least when you are on the phone you cant help but just smile and giggle ever once in a while. But when its time to get of the phine you dont want to and when you are about to leave that person you dont want that person to stop holdong you. Also that when you are about to go to sleep you cant help but to dream about that person. I hope that was short enough for you and this helped answer your questoin.

No me salgan con la tarugada de que "que tiene de malo el sexo" que no va la cosa por ahi. No es cuestion solo de fisiologia. Hay cuestiones emocionales y de formacion que influye, pues el sexo no solo es un simple intercambio de fluidos. ?Tiene este cuate el dinero suficiente para hacer frente a la responsabilidad en caso que se rompa el condon? ?Y tu, ya tienes la suficiente capacidad para ser responsable para con un descendiente ( en caso de que el wey ese no se "salga" a tiempo)?

yOcsPq2kaa	That means you are possessive, and jealousy, am sorry. What is happenning to your friend its an advert for you, pls stop   doing to your friend what you wont like someone else do to you. Go get your love (judahmania2002@yahoo.co.uk)|`|3f9d2c2e6f9aacdb37499d7bc4bc35caaa	you should have thought about what you were doing before you done it! i think you should be honest with your friend, if you keep this inside for so long it will haunt you. do you really like this guy? do you see a future relationship with him? if yes, then you need to tell your friend either way what happened. if she's a real friend, she'll understand..if she goes crazy with you and doesn't speak to you then at least you were honest in the first place. Honesty is the best policy. xx Good luck xx|`|a979c54866b87b2d4b13df28ed06ebe8aa	owch|`|AA11312281	you have to make a choice. and those choices are 1) break your friends heart and lose her as a friend or 2) go for the guy and it doesn't work out and you lose him and your friend.

tv2iH3u9aa	She is probably interested in you, but your additional information suggests a few red flags. For one, do you really want to be dating someone who is sending you I'm-interested-in-you signals when she already has a boyfriend? The rule of thumb is that if she is willing to cheat on the guy before you, she'll be willing to cheat on you with the next guy.    Secondly, this interest in married men that you mention isn't a good sign.    It sounds like she's got some boundary issues. She also may just not be a great conversationalist, hence the standoffishness when you try to talk to her.    If you're still interested in her, I'd suggest you remain friendly but don't make any serious moves until she seems to have lost (a) her boyfriend and (b) her apparent interest in married men.    When I was young I was also interested in married men. In retrospect, I think I just wasn't interested in making a commitment to anyone. If you are the sort of person who wants a serious relationship with her (or at least the possibility of it), I'd doubt you'll wind up being very happy with her at this point in her life.    Maybe you should start smiling and staring at someone else in your building who might be a better candidate for a good relationship.|`|yp1PSWNdaa	Maybe she likes you, but wants to keep it a secret to others (who wouldn't) Or maybe she wants to play hard to get. There's' lots possibilities|`|157cc190646964f33bbea055bbee0c6baa	she porb likes u but is really shy!  approach her when her friends r around her or whenever she is not shy and really open....lol..girls r quite complicated ha    good luck
xCBC9rsYaa	You need to tell a teacher that you trust. This boy sounds crazy. If it was ten years ago when this happen I would say let it go,but now a days you can't. There are too much kids with problems    Best answer PlZ|`|NiUZ1yUHaa	size is not the issue here.  stand up to him and stand your ground.  if u let him push u around now, he will do it for a long time.  when he isnt expecting it, hit him as hard as u can.|`|KnehHt3taa	threatening to kill anyone is against the law. you should tell a teacher or administer at your school that you trust. this guy sounds like he is jealous, angry, and insecure... and he sounds dangerous. do not let him get away with such behavior.|`|RlDVy1BDaa	wow. maybe he's just jealous that your gettin all the ladies. lol. whoop his ***.|`|EgVa8XCZaa	im about your age and if i were one of your gfs id tell this guy to quit talkin krap and if he says it again tell him next time u see him itll be in court. if he says u or your parents cant sue him say maybe not but my parents/grandparents can sue yours  & win for threating to kill|`|T7ga2HBBaa	Im in seventh grade. boy do i know what that feels like.

I love messin with people that mess with me. its wuite funny. good luck!|`|alGl74WFaa	'1- talk to him. try and find out why he's bullying u.  2- if it doesn't stop, tell an adult you trust.    my little sis, Monica, is in 6th grade. she had the same thing happen. she asked why and the other girl told her it was because she was jealous. she said that she thought my sister was REALLY pretty and she had a lot of friends and guys falling for her. now, that girl is one of my sister's best friends. if you try being nice, or telling somebody, things can work out really well. tell us how it works out and good luck!!!!! :-)|`|aT8mS4gnaa	he is just jealous he probably knows that you are weak so he hits your weak spot tell the school counselor|`|157cc190646964f33bbea055bbee0c6baa	omg tht sux! if u hav an older sibling than tell them if not umm...tell a guardian that a kid is threatning to beat up all of ur gfs!   hope i helped    Good Luck
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Hes bluffing or he would have left. I say next time he says it you should go to the door open and say bye. Hes using that line to get his own way. You need to stand up for yourself.|`|66821855b0d24b5783848c81bb17c8a4aa	he does not want you to feel secure. it's about control.|`|66wtSIHAaa	I don't know but that is mean.|`|XvdzfaCFaa	Staying because you back down. Each time he's betting that if he threatens to leave, you'll back down. Bluffing is more like he's HOPING to win, but doesn't know if he will. He's thinking he's gonna win everytime. So, he goes all-in. Sorry for the poker analogies, but you started it lol. Anyway, my advice would be to go all-in. If he doesn't really WANT to leave, just wants to win, HE'LL back down. If he leaves, that's his lost. Either way, I'm not sure you actually need a guy like that, but that's a subject for a different time.|`|TLVrQIv3aa	It's his way to get you to do what he wants you to do. Call his bluff. If he leaves, he isn't worth the effort. I agree with your friends.|`|4643a9f4b7d8e1c56cbbda506c748dc1aa	tell him dont let the door hit you where the good lord split you .dont let him threaten you guys are a dime a dozen if he didn't care about you he wouldn't come back , dont show him that it bother's you when he leaves and he'll over it .good luck|`|vE1mEtR1aa	Cause thats what he feels and that aint what he means|`|ehmcgh7Uaa	Honestly I think its scare factor he knows what scares you and is using it to his advantage. It's know right, you may want ot ask him about it, see what he has to say.|`|ebcd2265d06f52b66cbaa67bf1b26744aa	If this is this the kind of behavior that is rewarded he always will do this.    Don't take it. That's childish, selfish, manipulative and a lot of other nasty things. He's not exactly bluffing, because if you don't continue to back down and do whatever he wants when he wants, or act a certain way, he won't stay.     You just have to ask yourself, is this what I want out of a bf?
48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Don't worry about being inadequate with this guy.  Right now is a good time for you to just keep busy and try to release the pain from the old relationship.  This new guy probably does have more experience and that's good for you because maybe he can teach you a thing or two.  If he continues to tell you that you need to improve then you should learn everything you can from him and dump him when you get bored.  A real guy would be a little bit more compassionate to your feelings and experience and more than happy to let you grow at your own pace.  If he can't appreciate you for who you are then learn what you need and move on to someone else.|`|eafetFCRaa	I read your question and it made me gasp. I dated who I thought was the man I'd marry (he was 26 and I was 21). Immediatly after we broke up, I met another man who was 13 years my senior. The relationship was great because it kept my mind off my ex, but it was hard because he made the same comments. He always made little comments about my gaining weight, eating too much, or not being as successful as him. I stayed with him because, in a way, I wanted to prove that I was a great girl, but it was hard.   Looking back on it now, that relationship was horrible for me. I gained weight not because of my eating habits, but because of the way he talked to me. As soon as our relationship ended, I had time for myself.  This is going to suck. Trust me...leaving this man is the best choice for you. There is a time in everyones life that should be dedicated to working on themselves. It has been two straight years since my relationship with the older man. I haven't dated or cared to date. I've lost weight and have learned to love the things about me that I used to hate.   Give yourself time to do that. It is worth it in the end....And if you ever need to talk...I am here. I've been there before.|`|CDyMqAVmaa	Sweetie, I think you have already answered your own question.  1.  You called it a "Rebound Relationship" and unfortunately that is extactly what it is.  You, yourself said you only went out with him cause you thought it would make it easier to get over you ex.  2.  If he knows (or cares) any thing about you he should be aware of the fact that you just got of a long term relationship and no decent human being can recover from a broken relationship even if the relationship was bad.  Sounds like you a good person and are trying hard to do what is best for you.  If he is making you feel inadequate whether it is intentionally or not, he is not the right person for you at this time in your life.  There is nothing wrong with YOU!  Trust your instincts!  If something doesn't feel right then it probably isn't.  99% of the time, if you trust that funny little feeling that you have deep down in the pit of your stomach you will find out that you are right.  3.  This guy sounds like an insensitive, creepy jerk.  Dump him and keep moving on.  Learn from your mistakes.  You can't make yourself feel something that just isn't there.  4.  Time heals everything.  Give time time.  Good Luck !|`|bdd76cdec349f616dd1b6647c6d10818aa	If he is not making you feel "worthy" just being yourself, he is not worth your time.  A real man knows how to treat women so he can make them feel "enough" for who they are.
48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Think very had what kind of message you want to send to him without using any words and then find the clothes that match that message...  Hope that helps....|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Long sleep pants, long sleeve shirt, Chastity belt ... that should do it!|`|f288275f385496070033a5d6606c01f7aa	If your not doing "what we think you're doing" stick to boy shorts and a thin tank top.  I know i'd love slipping in next to my lady wearing that!|`|dd8c37b3e47b75536efce199ea43e069aa	have him wear a snorkel...and u wear the flippers...|`|b0bfa407b394bfb81906a24c82139f0baa	i think u should wear a long t-shirt|`|oPXmsU9Aaa	Skimpy shorts and a tank top.
AA12333131	im only 15 but i know what ur talking about.  I was talking to this 18 year old and ...it felt like i liked him way more than he liked me.  He always told me he liked me more, but comes to find out...he liked someone way better than me.  All I can say is, High school boys play games, but you have a man. so the best thing for you to do is talk to him and see what he has to say. communicating keeps the relationship going.|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	The only way you will know how he feels about you is to have a talk with him.    You can't assume anything.
48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	There's lots of factors you have to consider.  Career, goals, family, interests, chemistry.  How do you feel when you're together?  How do think it will be in ten years when you're 46 and he's 33??  Will the love and passion still be there??  Do what comes naturally?  Follow your heart and forget what other people think.  Best of luck!!!!|`|3784d3779347dece212f21c3d3632285aa	I have a friend that will be 23 soon  and I am 35. I will say the only thing that matters is how you relate to each other.

I waste my time here but I'm not single and I;m not a girl. Oh, maybe I should just shut the hell up and answer some other question then.       yeah.         That's what I'll do.|`|73211431bfc5d82ad1b65eda95f3bf72aa	im single but theres someone im "connected" to.    edit:  haha, i like the answer above. when i moved from california i wasnt single anymore.
Dmu1aGxzaa	When it comes from your heart and your soul follows.  Sometimes the thing is to be alittle upfront in your feelings.  Some guys are shy and really don't know what they want.  Sometimes holding on to something long gone and not even there anymore could make a person hesitant and not know how they truely feel deep inside.|`|T3Z4ZFs7aa	you can always ask him how he feel`s.or just drop little hints to him about how you feel and what you want..|`|4QmfFDN7aa	I personally think you should investigate and see if he really likes you as much as you like him and if he doesn't show any clues that he like you,then i think you should discontinue from pursuing something that doesn't feels the same way as you because if you don't then you could be putting your feelings in jeopardy of getting hurt and when your feelings is hurt, it doesnt feel good nor comfortable but it is my opinion and it is your choice.simple|`|e74c21792cd3183246018ac0e1553d2daa	Depends on you, what motivates you.  If you really want to know where this guy stands in reference to yourself...ask him.    Women have an advantage over men because they can deal with things much better then we can.....you sound like a strong woman......take control and find your answers.    Peace.    ------Duane

AA10252427	The older I get, the less I expect the BAM. It just doesn' happen. At least not when you expect it. My last GF/fiance was BAM from the moment we kissed. It was the fire that burned twice as brignt but half as long.   The botom line is that your relationship is what you make of it. If you want the BAM then make the BAM. At least make it for her... If she makes it for you... then you are all good.   Have a great summer and get a tan Dude!!!|`|8d2da85e08b3c15c327c4b743634cad6aa	taco bell|`|LbkmBs5Aaa	Just go with it at this point.  Don't over analyze the situation and think that something is wrong just because things haven't really changed.  That is actually probably a good thing.  It means that there is something deeper there between the two of you.  Just let things progress naturally, they will, you just have to let it happen.  Good luck!!|`|c5b1f9ade433ef242e7cdc3432581869aa	It really shouldn't all that much. People put it in overdrive when they announce the BF GF thing and it goes into burnout. I think your talking about the bliss stage. It may have been skipped cause you knew each other well before hand. That's a downside but a good thing is that you have a good shot at staying together a long time as long as you DON'T think things have to be a certain way. Diffference is now that you get to have sex with her.|`|mJPl8l4aaa	Well, it's kinda like your first kiss. You wait for it for a long time and you get all excited about it, but then it happens, and ur just like "WTF. That wasnt as good as i thought it was gonna be. Crap." It's normal. You obviously have liked her for a while, so the shock and super-excitement happened a long time ago.|`|cda0a4c2a62eaaa35717c5cb817aec68aa	When my current boyfriend and I started dating, we didn't have a title. After a while it was just sort of understood that we were a couple. After a few weeks to a month he started calling himself my boyfriend. Nothing, other than the title changed in our relationship.
BxFlqcXQaa	Yes I have a crush. He is my boyfriend, Anthony. We have been together for almost two years and I still have a crush on him. I still butterflies when he kisses me and my heart starts beating faster whenever I hear his voice. I still get this big goofy smile on my face when my cellphone rings and I see its him.

48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Your bf obviously has a heart and sounds like a sincere person but he should try to understand that it couldn't be prevented.  Life gives us good and bad feelings all the time and if we put too much emphasis on what's going to happen and not focus on the here and the now you spend your life second guessing yourself and that would be even worse.  Accidents happen and we live and learn from them.  Maybe it was a sign for him to appreaciate life more.  Maybe it was a sign that he doesn't say I love you and thank you to the people that are most important in his life.  Maybe it was a sign that life can change in a instant and we should focus on our loved one's, find our passions in life, live for today, celebrate tomorrow, create casual acts of kindness, there are so many more positive things people could do to feel alive.  Just tell him to be thankful that he has someone like you looking for advice to ease his pain.....|`|NvBHVpgjaa	He won't stop feeling this way until the co-worker that got hurt forgives him and says it's not your bf's fault!  That's probably the only way he'll be able to accept it!
3ce430835e39e19f0324e371af312c30aa	well what do you guys fight about?? jealousy? from you or  her?? think about how it starts, is she sad? are you sad?  does she get mad ??? think about wat is starting the  argument.. talk to her face to face and tell her that you dont  want to argue, that you want to make it last.. seriously  thats the worse that can happen, to just give up. if you really  love this girl, do the impossible for her.. and if she loves you  back she will do wat it takes to fix it.. =]  trust me ive been through this.  good luck|`|Kkwe26tWaa	Wow, this sounds a lot like my bf and I. We never fought before and now I can't believe how much we fight.     I'm not sure what you fight about but it could be you need to spend less time together. Even good friends can get on each others nerves if they're together too long lol. I would definitely suggest whenever you guys start to argue to try to talk it out calmly and come to a resolution without arguing since that never helps anything and leads to hurt feelings.

48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	no, you shouldn't call him.  You've already texted him and now it's his turn to respond.  He really could be busy or he just might be interested anymore.  Either way don't call because then it makes you look pushy.  If he wants to get a hold of you he will, but don't wait around.  Go out and have some fun with someone who doesn't play the 3 day rule game.|`|1TrRrWMLaa	I would give him one day and call him on Saturday if he does not call or text you tomorrow. You want him to know you are interested, but you do not want to seem to eager. This guy sounds like he likes to play games. So you need to a little as well. Good luck, and I am sorry you have a guy that likes games.|`|zM1C77fpaa	take the hint... leave him alone|`|fM6JAoQpaa	Drop him.  If he was really interested, he wouldn't play games like "3 day rule"|`|XFzX4nLSaa	Don't call or text him anymore. It's his turn to reply. If he doesn't, I'm sorry ;(|`|RQT3747Vaa	he's lost interest. . . move on. . . if ne one adhere's 2 the 3 day rule, they're not really interested. If they were they'd call, text wutever next day.

Flirting.... ok when you like someone I dont think there is such thing as too much flirting. Also you dont wanna do too little and have him think that you are in fact ignoring him and his needs. I would say in this case too much rather than not enough. So my advice is to flirt alot but when approriate. He doesnt wanna be smothered also..|`|3KZUJZEraa	don tell him you like him right away.    play around a little before you do anything. just spend more time with him, talk more, and do more stuff together. then tell him you like him and see what happens from there.|`|WEVdWV64aa	Be yourself duh.......
ztNZL5bvaa	okay its gonna really hard for her bcoz she ain't gonna like it. maybe u feel jealous, but u should know more about him, find his weakness that can help u, and see how treats u if he treats u bad then tell ur gf or otherwise dump both of them.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	talk to her about it|`|0257405ba753387de2a08b45f2c258ffaa	u need to talk to her about this|`|4afbc44f7b8193ae758399834f119569aa	I'd be a little careful over the fact that she says that she's in love with you already. That's not true love. My girlfriend and I waited 7 months before we said we loved each other because we didn't want to ruin the moment. As for the guy, don't worry about him. If they were going to go out, they would have all ready. Even if she's not in "true" love with you, she still really likes you. Just don't worry.|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	You should do the opposite.   Find another good looking girl and keep her as your own best friend.  If she can have one why can't you.  That way you both have someone on the side as your friend.  If she has a problem with this then she's a selfish girl and you need to dump her and find someone else.|`|AA10844903	talk to her. tell her how the man is making you jealous. if shes a good g/f shell listen|`|mYzp10iGaa	just tell how u feel about the guy|`|q4odG02raa	she can have him as a friend, or u could just tell her ur concerned about him but u still want 2 b wit her|`|cs3H3VhGaa	You sound really young and naive, and if your scratching your head wondering what naive means then assume you are. Don't worry, if she is in love with you, which, I'm sure she has told every single one of her boyfriend's, meaning she thinks love is the same thing is liking someone. Which it is not. Just enjoy the time with her because it won't last very long.|`|uedd1QCZaa	look if she broke up with 3 other guys for him its obious ur not the one thats gonna ruin their friend ship so break up with her or its gonna drive u crazy or give it time like if ur gonna last a long time after about 4 months just like slowly drive a wedge between their friend ship when ever shes with him just walk up to her and hug her or kiss her the guy will feel akward and just walk away and if u do that enought eventually they'll stop being friends|`|E6EZxC4Kaa	It sounds to me like she doesn't really care about her boyfriend's feelings and maybe she should be single until she learns to be more understanding. I'm sure she wouldn't like it if you had a female friend that you were really close to and heard you dumped 3 females because of that. Be careful if you do decide to talk to her about it because she still might take it the wrong way and it could backfire on you.

4428a349d91ccc84225a0c79844341a6aa	Your problem is no longer with him...  It's with you.  You need to do everything you can possibly do to try and get back to normal fore as long as you stay in your condition, you will alienate everyone else around you.  What happened was wrong, but why should that stop you from living your life the way you want.  He physically didn't take anything from you and mentally you are the one taking away from yourself.    The best way to confront a sex offender such as this guy is with complete calmness.  Anger will basically be ignored, so you must hold steady and explain to him why what he did was wrong.  Your mind set with this guy should be to prevent him from doing this again instead of focusing on yourself.  You will find that by establishing a meaningful conversation, you will accomplish more and this act in itself could set you on a track to recovery.|`|a342ca86dadb1bb0788eaad3a2ccaf29aa	What has happened is done and over with  so PLEASE DO NOT let its memory keep churning you up inside  as the ONLY PERSON that is going to end up being hurt is YOU !

d974f7d9872614e12db344d3a90d6950aa	i guess you can only do so much for those of us who do put our blood sweat & tears into someone whom we'll die for.  like i said though you can only do so much though. the cool thing about a break up is liberation, new found self, & the rediscovery of a new man. we do not have to necessarily have things in common because we fuqen speak english & they fuqen don't! having things in common can kind of get dull. i allow the guy to be a free dog & roam. If he wanders to far & doesn't come back. trust me there are more streys waiting to be adopted. the people who say leave his azz truely believe in fairy tale relationships or they hide their fights w/ significant others & that's not to be talked about because it's to personal.

db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Pourquoi... en fait c'est plut?t "pourquoi pas?".    C'est trs compliqu en fait, d'un c?t je n'aimerais pas savoir que ma copine me trompe avec un autre mec et d'un autre si elle dcidait de se barrer avec un autre mec je l'accepterais (de toutes fa?on on a pas le choix...).    Ma copine n'est pas ma proprit et elle a droit a une vie prive, ce n'est pas un animal domestique.  Si elle me trompe je ne prfre pas le savoir (elle l'a dj fait et je lui ai dit que je prfrais ne pas savoir), et ceci je l'applique  moi mme. J'ai 2 ou 3 copines que je vois de temps en temps pour prendre un verre le plus souvent, donc souvent il ne se passe rien, mais parfois elles restent chez moi. Donc de fait je trompe ma copine... oui j'avoue... mea culpa mea maxima culpa.  Mais alors pourquoi? Parceque j'en ai envie, de l'envie et du dsir, je ne triche pas sur les sentiments, c'est juste pour passer un bon moment avec quelqu'un que j'apprcie mais avec qui je n'ai pas envie de former un couple. Alors je vois d'ici les nanas qui vont me traiter de salop et tout, c'est votre point de vue, mais pour info mes "copines" en question... ont toutes un mec...  Ca n'excuse rien c'est sur, mais quand mme,  force je vais bien finir par me demander si cette histoire de fidlit n'est pas juste une histoire de morale  la con qui n'a rien  voir avec la nature de l'Homme (grand H donc homme et femme).  Est ce que l'amour empche l'infidlit? 99% du temps sans doute, mais le 1% o on se laisse aller remet il en cause les 99 autres?
