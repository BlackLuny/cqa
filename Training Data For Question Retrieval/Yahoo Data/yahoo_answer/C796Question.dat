20090308034909AAWeqVk	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	The smell of meat that has gone off...?	I just saw a question about meat that had gone off and it smells.   I always call my mum and she says "if it smells bad". What is that smell?! Have I never come across bad meat? I stick my nose in the bag where I keep the chicken/beef/pork - the smell isn't something I'd bottle and make a perfume out of but it is not very strong, you can barely smell anything. So what does bad meat smell like? Is it similar to something? And more so - is it a very strong smell?    I took chicken out of the freezer yesterday and today I am going to cook it (it has been in the fridge the whole time). I want to do the smell test to be sure. My partner had food poisoning he was sitting on the toilet with a bucket in front of him -  I definitely do not want to experience that ever. Thanks :o)

I'm vegetarian.      He constantly handles raw meat (he's just been handling raw lamb) then doesn't wash his hands before opening the fridge, putting on the kettle, going to the toilet etc.      Not only is it disgusting from a hygiene point of view, but it's also horrible for me as a vegetarian to have meat fat smeared all around my house.      I've tried talking to him about it, and I've tried making it obvious I'm cleaning the kettle before I touch it, but all it does it makes him do a quick splash under the water (with no soap) and he rolls his eyes at me.      So what can I do to get him to appreciate how vile it is? And how unthoughtful towards me he's being?

20090308070114AAdZHye	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Why do people go strictly vegan or raw foodist?	Why is it so bad to eat cooked food every now and then or try some honey if you're vegan? raw foodists go as far as eating raw cakes, well if you're gona eat something with empty calories who cares how it's prepared? everyone knows what foods are bad for us and if we eat them every now and then what's the hurt? is it all about discipline and superiority with you guys?

20090308073310AA2EjK2	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	What are starbucks eggs REALLY made of?	I just had an "artisan breakfast sandwhich" the ham one, they looked new and interesting. I tasted it and it was the 2nd grossest item I've ever eaten (first one being a breakfast sandwhich from Tommy's that had pickles, tomato, egg, chili, cheese etc. ew wtf).      The eggs are runny and grainy, not smooth or scrambled like they should be if cooked properly and if they are actually from Chickens. I've never tasted an egg that disgusting and their ham tasted burnt but I think It's because it was smoked ham which to me isn't really a breakfast item... Like normal honey baked or something.      So as my question goes, I've googled "Starbucks Eggs" with no real good information. Many people seem to enjoy it?      What are these pudding, grainy, disgusting eggs really made of?

20090308081727AANXEFc	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How to estimate baking temperature conversion for old ovens?	Hi there,          So I've consistently failed at baking the simple things such as chocolate chip cookies, and at first I thought it was because I was a male student who doesn't know the first thing about baking, but I've realized it's my damn old school oven that's been provided by apparently my landlords great grandma.          Anyway today I'm trying the ultimate banana chocolate chip muffins. The recipe requires baking for 15-20 minutes at 450 degrees F. In times past, I've had to alter say pizza (recipe: 10-12 min @ 450F) to 12-14 min @ 400 F - otherwise it gets very burned.       I guess I'm just looking for advice on converting the temperatures for old ovens...and if anyone else has been drivin to the brink of insanity because of this.  Thanks!
