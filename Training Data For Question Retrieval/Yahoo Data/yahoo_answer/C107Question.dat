20090129083931AAzBh1m	Politics & Government;Politics	Are you being paid equal pay for equal work?	President Barack Obama signed a new pay-equity measure into law Thursday, effectively overturning a 2007 Supreme Court decision that made it harder to sue for pay discrimination.          The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act is the first bill President Obama signed.        The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, named for a former Goodyear Tire employee who sued the company for gender discrimination in 1998, is the first bill signed by Obama.      "It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign ... we are upholding one of this nation's first principles: that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness," Obama said at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House.      "If we stay focused, as Lilly did, and keep standing for what's right, as Lilly did, we will close that pay gap and ensure that our daughters have the same rights, the same chances, and the same freedom to pursue their dreams as our sons."      The new law removes a provision requiring employees seeking equal pay to file a complaint within 180 days of receiving their first unfair paycheck.

I think the air force would be a little bit better than the army and navy because for one i'm not a great swimmer. For two I really do not like the army. I have talked to many people about all of them and people with experience from the military says that I probably will like the air force. I'm a really interested in the military world because times are hard right now and this will give me a chance to doing something great for myself. Some people say I should go and others on the other hand says no. I really have nothing to loose....really. I have no kids and have experience in college with a high school diploma. So, actually I think this might be right for me. All i'm asking is to receive some opinion's from some people out there and I would like some SERIOUS ANSWERS PLEASE.

Tax cuts are ineffective stimulus - PERIOD.      The underlying folly of the conservative push for an all-tax cuts approach is the simple fact that tax cuts are ineffective stimulus. Mark Zandi, a former adviser to Sen. John McCain's (R-AZ) presidential campaign and the chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com, has argued for months that the "fiscal bang for the buck" of tax cuts is significantly inferior to spending increases. According to Zandi's research, a corporate tax cut delivers $0.30 in real GDP growth for every $1 invested. In comparison, infrastructure spending delivers $1.59 in GDP for every $1 spent. Zandi isn't alone in this belief: the Congressional Budget Office "deemed last year that corporate tax cuts are 'not a particularly cost-effective method of stimulating business spending.'"        http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/...        http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/docume...        http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/...        http://pr.thinkprogress.org/2009/01/pr20...

20090129085106AAxqWzT	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Isn't this calling for bipartisanship kumbaya extremely naive?	and even fallacious?      think about this for a moment.  There is a serious divide between what President Obama and those who voted for him in the election and Republicans...correct?      So how can he believe he that Republicans will suddenly drop their ideology and what they stand for and join him in implementing his ideology?   Politics is about excercising power when you have it (legally) and compromising when there is a need for it (putting the minimum votes together to pass a bill)...its not getting everyone to agree that your way is the best so we can feel good about how we are cooperating.      The other thing to consider is this....if Obama and Democrats are willingly giving concessions to Republicans just to try to get more of them to vote with Democrats to pass a bill, and the Republicans get some concessions but still do not vote for the bill, what does this accomplish other than what we knew all along wich is that Republicans have a different ideology than Democrats.      Sure I understand that polls show that its favorable to appear like you are extending olive branches and that makes you look good and drives up your approval ratings, but how does this help accomplish the agenda that the people who voted for you put you in office to accomplish?      For once, can politicians try to actually follow the will of the people and represent them and not be playing games trying to plan for the next election?

20090129085348AAxS8qD	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What happened to the law and employer ethics?	A sad but true story of how employers use and lie to people:     In the first week of August, 2008 I took a Job as a temporary Employee (ENTECH)with a company called Progressive Medals in Ferndale, Michigan. The job seemed to be going fine, full time employees, and supervisor made several comments to me that I was doing a good job, am performing better than other temporaries had in the past. In the third week of August, I went to the Supervisor and ask him if I could leave at lunch that day do to the fact I had gotten a call for a supervisors job, that was more where my expertise is. He in turn said you could leave but we were hoping to hire you, as you have done such a good job for us the last few weeks and it would be hard to replace you. In turn, I ask are you sure, because I need a job that has benefits, and he said I am 99.9% you will be hired. I ask him what kind of money are we talking, he gave me a number and although it would be 1/3 of what I was making at my last employer. I felt it would pay for my insurance and give a few more dollars then I made as a temporary, You see Im not a greedy person, I feel I can work up to a better position as time goes by and they learn I have a lot to offer. I am a rarity in todays world, I am company driven person, and I always try to do what is best for a company, including looking at ways to save both time and money for them. However, back to where I was. He said let us see what I can do. Therefore, I did not go to the interview and stayed at work. So about two weeks goes by and he said we struck a deal with the temporary agency and we are going to hire you full time when you reach 720 hour as a temporary. I said that is great. I kept up the hard work as I always do. The only days I was late for work was when I had jury duty, however, I went into work every evening after I got done and even came in early to help make up the hours. In late September, they laid-off all the other temporary employees but they kept me. From that day, up until the last week of December, they kept reinforcing the fact that I would be hired in as a full time employee. Including saying things to other employees like it is a done deal we are just waiting until he gets his 720 hours in. In late November, the supervisor asked me where I stood with my hours, I said Im not sure but I think Im very close to the 720, he said Ill check. He did and said I was about 70 hours short, I said that about what I came up with.    This put me at about the first week of December, I would be hired in. On the second week of December the supervisor came to me and said where going to hire you in but, we just laid off 13 people so I need to ask you how much you would take per hour. I said look I know it is tough so I will take one dollar less per hour then we first talked about. I figured that would cover my insurance and I would still make what I was as a temporary employee. He said that is great, and I will tell HR. During the last week December the same supervisor came to me and said, were going to hire you but you have to wait until the first week of January, because it would be better for HR on paperwork; I said OK. So I ask seeing you guys are only open for two days the week of Christmas and Im not going to make any real money for two days are you going to lay me off so I can collect my unemployment, he said I cant because it would start my hours with the temporary agency all over. I said; that did not sound right, and why are laying-off you full time people and keeping me. He said so they can draw unemployment and not lose as much money that week, I let this go also.     The first week of January, the company had a meeting and said they laid-off seven more people, however, said they where behind on 58 jobs and where signing a big contract on some heat shields for General Dynamics. Furthermore, cut employees pay from 10 to 20% to save money. I found this to be strange and out of character for a company. On one hand you say were behind, we signed a big contract that is going to be tough to meet the deadline and we laid-off people. However, the question was, what about me? When I asked, they said were not hiring you, I said then why are you keeping me as a temporary and laying-off you employees. Well you see we need you to do the parts for General Dynamics. If you need me then why are you not hiring me as promised me for months? This is when thing stared to go wrong.     They stated, we could not hire you because it would be illegal, and we would spend tens of thousands of dollars in litigation fighting laid-off employees. I said that is not the law, this is an AT-WILL employment state; I said that they needed to stop trying to distort the law and just be honest. I said do you know I have relied on your promise and turned down two other interview do to this promise. I said I need insurance for my family, they said we would see what we could do. I said to them, look you could meet me half way, you cou

Hill Republican: Stimulus aids illegal immigrants   Associated Press - January 29, 2009 11:43 AM ET      WASHINGTON (AP) - A top Republican congressional aide says the $800 billion-plus economic stimulus measure could steer government checks to illegal immigrants.      Republican officials are concerned that the Democratic-written legislation makes people who came to the United States illegally eligible for tax credits of $500 per worker and $1,000 per couple.      A House-passed version of the bill and one making its way through the Senate both disqualify nonresident aliens from receiving the credits. But neither requires a worker to have a Social Security number to get the credits.      An economic aid measure enacted in February 2008 that sent rebates to most wage earners required that people have valid Social Security numbers in order to get checks."    http://www.kmir6.com/Global/story.asp?S=...

For those of you who see us as irrelevant...do you feel this way because there were only 55 million of us (just under half of the voters) who voted Republican and that is an irrelevant number?   OR   Do you subscribe to the Obama position of "I WON" so what Republicans believe is irrelevant?

20090129090109AADkDab	Politics & Government;Immigration	I have a question about the immigration and my husband.?	I sent in the I-751 (Petition to Remove the Conditions of Residence).       My husband has a 2 year green card that is going to expire at the end of March of 2009.      The proofs that I sent in was       1. bank statement with both our names on it   2. consumers energy bill with both our names on it    3. tax statement with our names on it    4. pictures   5. one of the proofs I sent was the birth certificates of our kids.       Now on both birth certificates the birth of my husband is incorrect. One birth certificate says that he was born in Palestine and the other says that he was born in California. Now he was really born in Jordan. They made a mistake on both of my kids birth certificate of where my husband was born.       This was an honest mistake.      Now I know that I should have fixed the problem before I sent it to them. But now what is the immigration going to do to me and my husband?

20090129095104AAdZDEc	Politics & Government;Politics	Is Obama making the Republican Congress cut their own throats?	He invites them to the White House to discuss the stimulus package and shows the American people that he is trying to work together with the Republicans.  Then they vote party line while only promoting a stimulus package that reflects the economic ideas of the past 8 years.      Since the Democrats can pass the bill without Republican votes, is Obama just helping to set up the Republicans for failure at the polls in the next election?

20090129092704AAR74p9	Politics & Government;Politics	Which of these scenarios is more likely, or can you suggest another one?	1) The stimulus works beautifully and quickly, and the GOP is obliterated in the 2010 and 2012 elections.      2) The stimulus works, but slowly, so Obama and the GOP get into a massive PR fight in 2010 and 2012, leading to some GOP gains but Obama gets reelected.      3) The stimulus barely works, the Democrats get creamed in 2010 and 2012. Obama gets reelected, but loses his majority in the House and barely keeps in the Senate.      4) The stimulus fails, the economy tanks, and Obama is ousted along with the majority of the Democrats.       5) Your scenario.

20090129100047AA8ucIy	Politics & Government;Government	What revolutionary act would you suggest?	This is for the people who believe that the line has been crossed, and that we are living under tyranny, and have been for some time now.      I am not talking about going down to the voting booth and choosing one criminal over another.      I think an economic boycott of the government is the only thing short of the "old school" kind of revolution left. Less trade, more self-reliance, less credit-based living, will drastically reduce the government's income. Of course, they will retaliate in some way, and I suppose in the end it always comes down to one thing with brutes.      Also, boycotting the "big 3", since it not the "auto industry" getting a bailout, it is just a few companies that should be allowed to fail. Buy Toyota and Nissan, and others who didn't go ask the government for YOUR money when all you get is the "privilege" of buying one of their inferior cars. If the government is going to prop up failed companies at our expense, then we need to take back that control and force what should have happened to happen.       Buying Japanese is truly the American Way in this case.      What do you suggest?

20090129093830AA4JDyM	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Gateway drug theory with marijuana ?	For starters i dont smoke marijuana       With marijuana, anybody who actually does a little bit of research knows that its not bad for you. Alot of people think it kills braincells, but that is just a myth. The only thing that it might cause is cancer (and funny enough no study can prove it, which i found surprising). If you dont believe me then look it up, because if you answer saying that im wrong then you are just being ignorant. So compared to alcohol its not bad at all. Also keep in mind that 18% of people in Canada (my country) have used marijuana just in the past year and 45% of people have used it in their lifetime.      So all us educated people can agree on this, and it is an argument used to promote the legalization of marijuana.But the strongest point of the people who thing it should be illegal use the unproven gateway drug theory. (the theory says that if you start smoking marijuana then you will eventually start doing worse drugs)      I dont think its true, and many others dont. But if it is my theory is that making it legal would almost eliminate the gateway effect. This is because if you are going to a drug dealer illegally to get marijuana then you you associate marijuana with worse drugs. If you go to this dealer often then you will probably get offered other drugs and it will be very easy for you to get harder drugs. But if it was legal then you might not want to get illegal drugs. Also drug dealers would be much more scarce because they would be making most of their money and customers from weed, but they can no longer sell it. So to get harder drugs a person would have to go far out of their way and it would take a lot of work.      Do you think my theory makes sense and is a good argument?

They started the   avalanche,  now we are getting buried.  Taxes still fair, but the overall   economy is bad.  We need to tax these borders, and have tariffs.   Cut back on Iraq,  as this war will smooth itself out once Obama goes   overseas.  With his peace talks that is. Once we cut the troops,  then   we will see a significant change.

My friend was accepted to Fordham University and is upset because he can't decide on a degree that he is passionate about. He's awesome at History and different things, but he realizes that it's somewhat of a waste to go to college for that.       He HATES math, but I do realize anything that's worth a tad might require it. Unfortunately, Fordham University here in NYC is VERY limited and traditional with their majors. He's looking into Environmental Studies versus a Business degree because he feels it's a little more specific. I wish Fordham had a degree in Construction Management because he is definitely a blue collar kind of guy (works demolition now) and that might be something in his field..      ANY SUGGESTIONS? I'm asking in the wrong section because I felt that I would bump into more intelligent and/or college educated individuals...   Thanks!

And is scintifIcly and Geneticly false! I being amix person if there is such a thing feal that this type of thinking is a big problem in the USA. it is not found  in alot of other places in the world.   And it's slave master thinking in the frist place, If you set a law saying that a mixed person is not white he cant vote in favor of the slaves. The one drop rule still blages the US. to day       One drop rule      Warren Harding and Barack Obama.    [show]   Harding may have had enough African American ancestry (one great grandparent) for him to be black under the one drop rule.[85] Conversely Barack Obama has one African parent and one white American parent. Having a white parent is never enough to be considered white, there is no reverse one drop rule. Obama is normally identified as black and identifies himself as African American.[86]Further information: One drop rule and Racial segregation    The one drop rule — that a person with any amount of known of African ancestry (however small or invisible) is not white — is is a classification that has been used in the United States.[87] It is a colloquial term for a set of laws passed by 18 states of the USA between 1910 and 1931, many of these laws were passed as a consequence of Plessy v. Ferguson, a Supreme Court decision that upheld the concept of racial segregation by accepting a separate but equal argument. The set of laws was finally declared unconstitutional in 1967, when the Supreme Court ruled on anti-miscegenation laws while hearing Loving v. Virginia, which also found that Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924 was unconstitutional. The one drop rule attempted to create a bifurcated system of either black or white regardless of a person's physical appearance, but sometimes failed as people with African ancestry sometimes passed as "white" as noted above. This contrasts with the more flexible social structures present in Latin America, where there were no clear-cut divisions between various ethnicities.[88].      As a result of centuries of having children with White people, the majority of African Americans have white admixture, and many white people also have African ancestry. Robert P. Stuckert, member of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at The Ohio State University said that the majority of the descendants of African slaves are white.[89] Writer and editor Debra Dickerson questions the legitimacy of the one drop rule, stating that "easily one-third of blacks have white DNA".[90] She argues that in ignoring their white ancestry, African Americans are denying their fully articulated multi-racial identities. The peculiarity of the one drop rule may be illustrated by the case of singer Mariah Carey,[91] who was publicly called "another white girl trying to sing black", but in an interview with Larry King, responded that—despite her physical appearance and the fact that she was raised primarily by her white mother—due to the one drop rule she did not "feel white."[92][93][94]

Will Media Bash Obama For Trying To Enter Oval Office Via Window?      By Noel Sheppard       On Tuesday, President Barack Obama attempted to enter the Oval Office via a panel of windows he mistook for a door.   Will media ridicule him for this innocent mistake much as they did George W. Bush when he tried exiting a meeting with reporters in Beijing back in November 2005?   Before we examine the former president's treatment, the Daily News reported Wednesday (h/t NBer Prester John):   ? It looks like President Obama hasn't gotten acquainted to his White House surroundings. On the way back to the Oval Office Tuesday, the President approached a paned window, instead of the actual door -- located a few feet to his right. [...]      Obama, who was returning from meeting with Congressional leaders, may have been distracted by Republicans' icy reception to his $825 billion stimulus package, which is poised to pass on Wednesday even without a groundswell of Republican support.    As the News pointed out, "there was little note taken of Obama's rookie mistake."   By contrast, when Bush tried leaving a press conference through locked doors in a building he had no familiarity with back on November 20, 2005, the press had a field day using the story and picture as evidence of his stupidity.   In fact, a Google search of "Bush tries opening locked doors" yielded over 1 million results.     At the time, many used this incident as a metaphor for Bush not having an exit plan from Iraq. One such was ABC's "Good Morning America" as NewsBusters reported November 21:   This morning’s Good Morning America found symbolism in President Bush’s encounter with a locked door when attempting to leave a press conference. In the opening tease at 7:00 AM, Charlie Gibson said, "No way out. President Bush tries the wrong door on his trip to Asia and has fun for the cameras. But the big question now: Does he have an exit strategy for Iraq?"   Think Obama-loving media members will use his faux pas as a metaphor for anything negative currently happening in America or anywhere in the world?   Yes, that's rhetorical.   —Noel Sheppard

20090129095859AANmnua	Politics & Government;Government	Why isn't the US military using Dragon Skin body armor?	It's light, flexible, and a lot more effective than the current standard issue body armor. It has been shown to outperform the current plate armor in every test, including multiple bullet impacts, the AK-47's 7.62mm round (bullet), and even armor piercing bullets.    the argument of those who want to keep the old plate armor (I can't imagine why) was that it was too expensive, i.e. the soldier's lives aren't worth the money.  But now that the Obama administration has shown that it isn't afraid to to spend a lot of money on what they believe in,  (meaning the over $1 billion in irrelevant spending for Democrat projects that they tried to push through with the economic stimulus package)  now they should find no problem spending the money on the new Dragon Skin armor to further protect US soldiers, and they should do that... don't you agree?

Obama gets reelected, but loses his majority in the House and barely keeps in the Senate.      4) The stimulus fails, the economy tanks, and Obama is ousted along with the majority of the Democrats.       5) Your scenario.

During the Hoover Depression there was no such thing as unemployment insurance. During the Bush Depression, the number of people receiving unemployment insurance payments is used as the unemployment rate. Those people who have used up their insurance aren't counted as unemployed. In States like Calif. where the money paid by workers and employers has been misdirected, when they can't pay any more claims, apparently their unemployment rate will be zero.

20090129110425AAw6oHk	Politics & Government;Government	Will President Obama's "Buy American" push mean the end of NAFTA?	by Veronica Smith Veronica Smith – 1 hr 26 mins ago      WASHINGTON (AFP) – A new "Buy American" push in President Barack Obama's economic stimulus plan is sparking protests about protectionism from US trading partners.      Passage of the 819 billion dollar economic stimulus package Wednesday by the US House of Representatives raised hackles in Europe and Canada, the United States's biggest trading partner.      Obama has pushed for swift passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as vital to prevent the collapse of the US economy, reeling from the global financial crisis that has thwarted governments' unprecedented actions to ease the turmoil.   http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090129/pl_...       Something I found interesting:      Obama, who criticized international trade agreements, including NAFTA, in his presidential campaign, has wasted no time in taking a tough stance on the trade front since taking office on January 20.       The next day, the Obama administration branded China a currency manipulator, setting the stage for a trade war with the Asian giant which has overtaken Japan as America's biggest foreign creditor.

As transcribed in My Latino News, Ms Gillibrand has promised in an interview this week she would work to make the lives of immigrants in America easier, firstly by proposing amendments to the guest worker programme.       Currently, those who apply for a visa for America under the guest worker program can stay in America for five years, but must leave the country for twelve months after two years has been completed.       Ms Gillibrand claims this is setting America up for illegal immigration, as many of the guest workers would not want to return to their country.       Her plan is to introduce a five-year guest worker American visa, which can be extended another five years and then can offer a pathway to citizenship.       "That’s the kind of program that people can count on when they come across, they know they have a job for five years and that they can renew it for another five years so if they wanna be here for a certain amount of time, they can have that consistency and they know what their lives are gonna be like, and then have a way for them to apply for their citizenship," she said.       In related news, thousands of people kick-started a campaign on President Obama's inauguration so that American immigration reform would be a top priority for Obama's first term. The campaign involved a march and 10,000 letters being sent to the White House protesting for immigration reform.           http://www.visabureau.com/america/news/2...

What is being prepared is a brutal escalation of US military violence in Afghanistan and a widening of the conflagration in the region.   Millions of Americans were channeled into voting for Obama and the Democratic Party by the illusion that they would implement a decisive shift away from the militarism and neo-colonial interventions that marked the Bush years. Instead, they face an administration that is just as determined as Bush's to use brute military force to secure the economic and strategic interests of American imperialism. Countless thousands of Afghan and Pakistani lives, and those of hundreds if not thousands more American troops, are to be sacrificed in the process.    http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/jan200...

20090129121200AA16m0c	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this a good way to save the government money?	Remove Welfare. (Inspired by a question that i previously answered)      Remove welfare COMPLETELY. The constitution doesn't give anybody the right to have the government be their "babies daddy".      Like i stated in my answer to the question that inspired this question. All or most of the people that i know on welfare are lazy people who can't take care of their children, but that doesn't stop them from having them. They have more kids and get more welfare and more medicaid and other waste of money programs. Am i wrong for thinking this? If they keep having kids and can't take care of them on their own they should not be allowed to keep their kids. How can someone so irresponsible be expected to raise children correctly. They should be stripped of their parental rights on the grounds of this irresponsibility. it will cost the government money in the beginning but it will help with cost in the long run.       Is this something America should do? It may seem cruel, but i think it is just fine.

20090129100623AAdrJ74	Politics & Government;Government	Do you know WHEN H.R. 645 goes up for vote in the House ?	I would like to urge my congressman to vote against it as it formally initializes FEMA concentration-style camps in the U.S.!      NEW LEGISLATION AUTHORIZES FEMA CAMPS IN U.S.         Paul Joseph Watson   Prison Planet. com   Tuesday, January 27, 2009      A new bill introduced in Congress authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to set up a network of FEMA camp facilities to be used to house U.S. citizens in the event of a national emergency.         The National Emergency Centers Act or HR 645 mandates the establishment of “national emergency centers” to be located on military installations for the purpose of to providing “temporary housing, medical, and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster,” according to the bill.         The legislation also states that the camps will be used to “provide centralized locations to improve the coordination of preparedness, response, and recovery efforts of government, private, and not-for-profit entities and faith-based organizations”.         Ominously, the bill also states that the camps can be used to “meet other appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security,” an open ended mandate which many fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic collapse.         Many credible forecasters have predicted riots and rebellions in America that will dwarf those already witnessed in countries like Iceland and Greece.         With active duty military personnel already being stationed inside the U.S. under Northcom, partly for purposes of “crowd control,” fears that Americans could be incarcerated in detainment camps are all too real.         The bill mandates that six separate facilities be established in different Federal Emergency Management Agency Regions (FEMA) throughout the country.         The camps will double up as “command and control” centers that will also house a “24/7 operations watch center” as well as training facilities for Federal, State, and local first responders.         The bill also contains language that will authorize camps to be established within closed or already operating military bases around the country.         As we have previously highlighted, in early 2006 Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root was awarded a $385 million dollar contract by Homeland Security to construct detention and processing facilities in the event of a national emergency.         The language of the preamble to the agreement veils the program with talk of temporary migrant holding centers, but it is made clear that the camps would also be used “as the development of a plan to react to a national emergency.   ”      As far back as 2002, FEMA sought bids from major real estate and engineering firms to construct giant internment facilities in the case of a chemical, biological or nuclear attack or a natural disaster.         A much discussed and circulated report, the Pentagon’s Civilian Inmate Labor Program, was more recently updated and the revision details a “template for developing agreements” between the Army and corrections facilities for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations.   ”      Alex Jones has attended numerous military urban warfare training drills across the US where role players were used to simulate arresting American citizens and taking them to internment camps.         Read the new legislation in full below.            National Emergency Centers Establishment Act (Introduced in House)      HR 645 IH      111th CONGRESS      1st Session      H. R.   645   To direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers on military installations.         IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES      January 22, 2009   Mr.   HASTINGS of Florida introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned      A BILL   To direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers on military installations.

But it paid more 10 months later i  was laid off.  I have been off work for about a year.  But my question is i have been trying to get back on at Ironwood which now is Directv because they bought ironwood out.  before i left i got my fiancee a job as a Technician in the field.  he comes in the mornings gets his work and leaves for the rest off the day.  Calls in when needs the girls to take care off a issue or pick up work.  Well now they need 2 Dispatchers in the office so i applied for it.  They called me to go in for a interview 2 days ago.  then 2 hours later the recruiter calls and said the head guys said he knows who  you are and you dont need to come in for a interview beause i worked there before i was like ok.  Then i would just have to wait for a call back.  Well my fiancee is friends somewhat with the head guy and asked them if they made a decision.  And he said they where not allowed to hire me because he worked in the office.  Because i would more than likely INCREASE his income.  This never happened this was never a issue when i worked for the company before.  Sounds to me like this is a unethical work issue.  Which is totally UNFAIR.  What should i do?????  Any ideas.  or should i just forget the whole thing and move on or should i talk too a attorney and see what they say?  Please help

20090129101323AAjAqMl	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Why didn't the police do anything after I reported a domestic dispute next door?	The people I live next door to are always rowdy, drunk, screaming at each other and so on. So I am used to it.  But about 3 am this morning they started punching each other up, screaming abuse, smashing plates, windows, I have never heard anything like it. And I was genuinely scared. So I went out the front, and their cat was in my yard, It's like it's back legs had been broken or twisted, I tried to catch it, but it dragged itself across my yard and I couldn't grab it to see if it was ok. I rang the police, said the people next door were fighting, and smashing plates and they dispatched a police unit to next door. They arrived about 10 minutes later, stopped outside their house, and by then the yelling had stopped. The police didn't even get out of the car, and as they started driving I tried approaching them but they didn't stop. Why didn't they go to the door of the house? I thought even though by the time they arrived the fighting had stopped, I thought the police still had to investigate and follow through with the report of a domestic dispute?  So I don't know if anyone was hurt next door or what, because I have never heard people scream and fight like that, and now I don't know what to do.

20090129101816AA3ywnX	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Is it true that China paid/pays it citizens to get out of recession?	I overheard a conversation at work that was very interesting.  The guy was saying that when China was (or is?) in a recession instead of paying the banks and big businesses and such to get out of slump they give every person over the age of 21 a bunch of money b/c in order to stimulate the economy people have to be buying and stuff in order to buy stuff you need the money.  He was saying how this could work for America b/c it gives the people the money and not the financial institutions.   B/c if you give the financial institutions the money they can offer loans and stuff but in a day an age where you should have some money before you take out a loan not a lot of people will be doing that.  I thought this was very intriguing.  Why give big businesses bailout when they only buy jets and fancy stuff for themselves and not help out the common everyday American like like it was meant for???? On NPR they were talking about the economy and such and said the public needs to trust the financial institutions for the system to work...but when those banks/corporations pull that s*** how are we going to trust them???  I can't wait to see how P. Obama's plan will turn out.  Over and Out!

20090129105054AAVzcOz	Politics & Government;Politics	Proper Stimulus or just another spending bill?	I can't help but question some of the "special interest" add-ons that seem to be tacked onto the stimulus bill that just passed through the house.  Some examples of what seem more like special interest, and just a big government spending spree are as follows:      25 Million dollars for ATV trails - In an economic crisis?      400 Million for the National Endowment of the arts      400 Million for global warming research - I don't understand how this will help our economy today!      335 Million for the Centers for disease control to combat sexually transmitted disease - I agree this is important but how does this boost our economy?      650 Million for coupons to convert analog to digital cable - On top of how much the government already has given in coupons, and again, how does this help the economy today?      The members of congress who proposed this bill argued that investment in infrastructure was very important, yet only 25 billion dollars has been appropriated to infrastructure.  When every single republican in the house and 11 democrats oppose the bill and call it a "spending bill" rather then a "stimulus bill" shouldn't we be concerned?  We all remember only a few months ago the 750 billion dollars stimulus bill that was proposed and all the good it did right?  I want to ask what we can do but I already know the answer...we voted these people into congress therefore it is what we wanted.  More big government spending.  Let's hope for a drastic change when the senate gets involved.

20090129091537AAwP7mn	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can a police officer give you more tickets after the initial ticket because you made him mad?	Ok here is what i mean exactly:      If a cop pulls you over for say speeding. Then, he approaches your window and he tells you, "I pulled you over for speeding" then he goes to his car after the routine stuff and comes back and tells you, okay i pulled you over for speeding but i am also going to give you a ticket for expired insurance (example).      Here is the kicker, if at that point AFTER he comes to your window with the 2 tickets all written up and ready for you sign (which im not questioning the 2nd ticket).       If at THAT point you piss him off and insult him or something, can he go BACK to his car AGAIN and now right you A THIRD ticket for something else say seatbelt violation or illegal tints or any other random thing he can think of?      The reason i am asking is because there is a debate as to the intentions of the third ticket. Does the officer have any legal rights to now give you a third ticket after he already approached you with the first set of tickets? Is there a law that states he cant just go back and now right you another ticket because you pissed him off? I know he wont make it seem that way in court, but shouldnt that be illegal? I mean, can he just sit there and tack on other tickets because you pissed him off?       Any feedback would be great. Remember he already gives  you your tickets to sign, but then you piss him off and he goes back to his car to write up another one.

One time Doug was sitting in his brother's pickup truck parked in an apartment complex that was located in a bad neighborhood and the officers wanted to see what Doug was doing and when Doug realized what he was doing he puts a few pieces of crack cocaine in his upper lip and Doug tells the officer that he was waiting for a friend of his and he was feeling nervous and panicky.      Then the officer askes what Doug has in his mouth and Doug claims he has cotton in his mouth and then the officer starts noticing it was crack cocaine in his mouth he quickly grabs Doug and tells him he is under arrest and Doug totally flips out and tries to prevent the officers from getting the crack cocaine that was inside his mouth and the officers had to slam Doug into the ground so he could spit out the crack cocaine he was hiding from the officers.      Then after Doug gets put in custody he starts telling the officers a bunch of SOB stories about him getting snubbed off by those snobby girls who he thought were his friends and he felt betrayed and rejected and he thought that him becoming a crack addict would be the only way to keep himself from hurting those snobby girls cause that was what he wanted to do but he thought that if he becomes a crack addict he could regain the respect from those snobby girls and that they'll be feeling sorry for him that they have snubbed him off.      Plus Doug also claims he wanted to get off of crack and to get his life together so he can have people be proud of him for trying to get his life together.      Unfortunately one of the snobby girls' father is the judge and he has had made Doug feel inferior to him and his family and he also hates Doug with a passion, the judge ends up giving Doug 5 years in the state penitentiary for posession of a controlled substance-crack cocaine and the snobby girls are now laughing and feeling good that Doug is now in prison and they're all happy and laughing that Doug has finally stooped to their low.      Doug is a really nice guy who would do anything for his friends and once all of his friends had snubbed him off was when he started to self destruct, Doug's record has been previously clean prior to his arrest for posession of crack cocaine

My husband has a 2 year green card that is going to expire at the end of March of 2009. He entered America legally.

Now he was really born in Jordan. They made a mistake on both of my kids birth certificate of where my husband was born.       This was an honest mistake.

The majority of people I talk to have misconstrued the Mayan prophecy about 2012. it say there will be a great change in the world, not that the world will end.      I know what that major change will be, here is how it will work out.      First, Obama's stimulus plan fails and the economy continues to get worse.      Second, there is a massive a public outcry and Obama approval rating tanks.      Third, Obama begins to surround himself with fanatical supporters and allies. the Congress passes a new version of the Fairness Doctrine that forbids the radio and news sources to speak out against the government.      Fourth, He begins to run the government through strict far left ideology and begins massive propaganda campaign against the Republican party and Conservative ways of thinking.      Fifth, Obama gets laws past that give more power before the Congress elections in 2010      Sixth, Republican majority in Congress after 2010 elections      Seventh, knowing the end is near Obama makes a fall back plan in case he loses the election.      Eighth, Obama loses the 2012 election, soon after on Dec 20th fanatical Obama supporters stage terrorist attacks across the country, while there are not many casualties, there is a sever psychological blow the US security,      Ninth, On Dec 21st Obama declares a national emergency and places the US under martial law (meaning he has complete control), soon after he abolishes Congress and strips the Senate and House of Reps of any power it could use against him.      Tenth, Obama reorganizes the US into a socialist regime with him in charge. And that is the major change the Mayans talked about.      sound about right?

20090128093203AAqkQoG	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do you think that I am well prepared for my court date?	My daughter was born while myself and the mother were minors. I am not on the birth certificate, there has been no paternity test, and no child support has been filed. I have tried to work things out peacefully with the mother but she simply refuses to let me see my daughter. I sent gifts and money to help with the little one but they don't count as support. So now that I seem to be forced into court and have turned 18 I have filed for parental rights and a paternity test through the child support office here in Ohio. I have documented emails through regular mail, myspace and facebook as well as letters. They range from between myself and the mother, myself and her parents, my parents and hers, as well as the mother and my girlfriend of 3 years. In all of them are evidence of the mothers immaturity and refusal to cooperate as well as the fact that she claimed to throw away all the gifts I bought. I want to use them in my case and make sure that I cannot be represented as immature. Can I submit them as evidence and refer to them in my  court case when I am given the chance to speak? Is there anything else that I can do to prepare for this case?

I was cut off from the mother and my child by the time she was 2 months along for the simple reason that she "didn't love me anymore". I know now that this was complete bull... but I was young and naive. I worked for years to see my little girl. I sent gifts and money. I offered to baby sit and sent letters, emails, called, I did everything I could and pestered the crap out of her and her family to be with my daughter. Now that I am 18 I have filed for parental rights and a paternity test. The mother has never filed for child support, and didn't put me on the birth certificate. She is threatening me with "back child support" because all the things I sent are only seen as gifts, not support. I don't think that she can do that because I was a minor, I am not on the certificate, she has never filed, and there has never been a paternity test. She is only threatening this to get me to back off because I don't make a lot of money. I don't care if I have to pay a million dollars I WILL see my daughter and be the father she deserves. I just don't want to be put into poverty over it because I just can't pay all of that at once. Is it legal to order a minor to pay back child support? I was under the impression that child support didn't even start until the mother filed. What are the rules here? I can't seem to find information on minors paying support.

They're not in danger of going under. I think they are in good shape going forward." -- Barney Frank (D-Mass.), House Financial Services Committee chairman, July 14, 2008      When you read about his involvement in the debacle, don't you question his judgment?  And if his judgment is to support the stimulus package, wouldn't you question that?  After all, he was wrong time and time again in the months leading up to the crash.        Has he suddenly seen the light?

Stewart Parnell is President and CEO of Peanut Corporation of America, which has knowingly shipped salmonella-tainted peanut products which have killed 8 people so far.      But he turned a good profit:      "Parnell had the experience and management skills sought by the Georgia plant owner, and the two formed a partnership. Parnell and his new partner have tripled the revenue in the Georgia plant in the three years since. That plant, Parnell said, is profitable for the first time in 15 years."    http://www.politicalfriendster.com/showC...

The problem is, I am supposed to appear in court Feb 26th to answer charges of contempt for refusing to give my dog to some drug abusers. I legally adopted the dog 7 months ago, but the druggies who formerly owned it got a judgment against me to return him. The dog had been abused, had not been wearing a license, rabies tag, or ID. I adopted him from the city. I should have hired a lawyer, but the whole thing seemed so ridiculous. It was obvious that the dog belonged to me. I paid for him and cared for him during the 3 months before they filed their court case.  They tried to steal him from me several times and each time  the dog ran the other way!

20090225124108AAaJy9Z	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	How can I get "borrowed" items back from my neighbor?	No good deed goes unpunished. This sounds a bit Seinfeld-ian:      Because we might be moving, I snagged a 5' wide brand new roll of bubble wrap from craigslist for free. The former owner received the roll from The Container Store so you know this was not cheap.       We have a family across the hall from our apartment who are very nice, my sister and I have had some nice conversations with them on occasion. They always kept an eye on our apartment while were went out of town, collected our newspapers so they are good neighbors.       While having a conversation with the husband and wife they informed me that they bought a house and will be moving out of the complex. I casually mentioned to them about my beloved bubble wrap and told them I have some if they need it. A short time later, the husband knocked on the door and asked to borrow some wrap. I handed him the whole roll and told him to take what they needed.       Last week we ran into the wife in the hallway and she said "thank you so much for the bubble wrap, I have used almost all of it, I feel like I should buy you another one". I thought "Okaayy". My sister ran into the husband a couple of days ago and he says to her "thank you so much for the bubble wrap. My wife collects dishes and she is still packing (they have been doing so for weeks now). It looks like she will be using all of it".       After that conversation my sister called The Container Store and was informed it would cost between $40-$75 for a new roll. I went online and priced rolls of wrap, Amazon.com had a great deal for about $15 including shipping.       Is is me or does it sound like I will not be getting any bubble wrap back? This might sound petty but I really do not have the money to buy another roll just like the one that was given away. I don't know how to ask them about it. I need to act quickly because this Saturday is their last day here.       Thank you for your help!

20090128113534AA4HBs3	Politics & Government;Politics	Did the Democrats deliberately tank our economy to gain power?	Democrats have caused our current economic problems, by:      1. Destroying the root of our economy by obstructing access to any economical fuel sources including oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydro electric, clean coal and anything else that could sustain a healthy economy. Fuel is the very core of our economy and they crushed it.      2. The democrats deliberately pushed the core of the credit crisis, and ignored warnings that things were being done by Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae that would be very harmful to our economy, by the Bush administration, and even John McCain. The democrats buddies in Freddy Mac and Fannie May (powerful advisers in the Obama campaign and huge democrat contributors to Obama, Frank, Dodd, Waters, and Reid among other democrats started out on a dangerous course, lied to investors about the status of the investment, and caused the credit crisis and the bringing down of banks and insurance companies because of those investments becoming worthless as collateral, making those institutions illiquid and thus unable to legally do business ... this sent a chill through all lending institutions and froze up credit which has lead to this disaster in the economy ... accomplished by democrats with a few idiot republicans help. The worst thing any republican ever did in the last 8 years, even 16, was to go along with democrats and try to work with them. They are the bane of the US economy, and it was caused by their lust for power and their greed ... as well as the accomplice of the liberal media and entertainment industry in this country working to push their lies and deceptions on the people of the US, and even the rest of the world.      Fuel being so high was the catalyst that caused the problems with the mortgage backed securities to come out like they did, and this destroyed the backbone of commerce and industry in the US and weighed so heavy on the world that the rest of the world could not bear the weight.      I also think China was deliberately driving up fuel prices and pushing things to a head, maybe working with some US politicians like the Clintons to make this happen, so things would be ripe for Hilary's presidential bid. This kind of thing is classic Clinton, if you really know how the man has worked in the past to get what he wanted. His mob exploits are long and detailed, and he thinks very big of course, afraid of nothing and knowing no limits.      This whole thing has effected the entire world, and it all goes back to what democrats have been pushing for decades. The press has been with them. The press is actually THE power, as they inform the voting public, or in the last decades they deliberately misinform the public to help the democrats gain power.      Do you think this mess was completely deliberate? Even done by design to gain power in the country by creating a crisis and because the masses don't really understand that the president can only influence so much, doing it during a republican presidency?

It looks like President Obama hasn't gotten acquainted to his White House surroundings. On the way back to the Oval Office Tuesday, the President approached a paned window, instead of the actual door -- located a few feet to his right.      Doors didn't open automatically for Obama’s predecessor either. While making a hasty exit from a 2005 press conference in Beijing, former President George W. Bush tugged on the handles of a door, only to find it locked.      Bush laughed off the blunder, but the pictures still live on as part of Bush's lame duck legacy. However, there was little note taken of Obama's rookie mistake.

Nora Sandigo, of Nicaraguan origin, is CEO of American Fraternity, a pro immigrant organization based in Miami, filed the lawsuit before the U.S. Supreme Court.      "Children continue to suffer by being separated from their parents because of deportations that the President may be able to suspend." Sandigo asserted. She also explained that filing this law suit is not because she or these children are against him, but to use his authority and urge him to issue an executive order to stop the deportations, and adopt new immigration laws.

But seriously all over at school and other places I see Obama shirts, buttons, belt buckles, pictures, binder covers, etc. So answer my question, why is he treated like the second coming?

NOTE:  I apologize if I sound naive, please keep it professional.  I'm not trying to avoid war, I care deeply about my family and I don't want to put my family through such stress and agony.  I'm unemployed and almost homeless.  I don't want to put my family through the stress of deployment, but it's my only "other" option...      My Father was in the army. He attributes the fact that he's alive today because of the Band.  The USA was deploying soldiers to Vietnam in his day and luckily he wasn't deployed because he played instruments.      If my Dads chances of going to war were reduced by being in the band, will my chances of going to war lessen if I join sports?  What if I'm a very talented Athlete?      In college you're required to take a full-load of classes if you want to engage in sports.  Is it the same in the military?  I just want a full-time job and soccer.

20090128124025AAiea39	Politics & Government;Politics	If you were in Congress, would you vote for/against Obama's proposed $800 billion stimulus bill?	You should know the argument for the stimulus.......      Here is the argument against:       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/010...       "Most of Washington has reached quick consensus: Government must do something big to shock the economy, and it should cost between $800 billion and $900 billion.      But dissident economists and investment professionals offer a much different take: Most of Washington is dead wrong.      Instead of fighting over what should go in the economic stimulus bill, pitting infrastructure spending against tax cuts and contractors against contraceptives, they say lawmakers should be fighting against the very idea of any economic stimulus at all. Call them the Do-Nothing Crowd.      “The economy was too big. It was all phantom wealth borrowed from abroad,” says Andrew Schiff, an investment consultant at Euro Pacific Capital and a card-carrying member of the stand-tall-against-the-stimulus lobby. “All this stimulus money is geared toward getting consumers spending and borrowing again. But spending and borrowing were the problem in the first place.”           http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/28/sto...       "On Monday night, the Congressional Budget Office sent out a full analysis of the House stimulus bill — elaborating on the partial number-crunching that were disseminated last week by Republican Hill sources. The new report elaborates on what the first one illuminated: the vaunted infrastructure spending will take years and years and years to kick in. Just 7 percent of the total $800 billion-plus stimulus funding would enter the economy by the end of this year."      How would you vote??

Do you have to take your physical, pick a job, and sign up? My recruiter said I would have to wait to see what I was selected for. If I only get the Open Area, do I have to go with that? Please Explain, I'm a little confused (as you can see)

How much money do you think would be sufficient to fund for the research of the environmental and human effects of a possibly dangerous element...? Mind you this would be funded by the federal government.

20090128122456AAPsaHi	Politics & Government;Politics	In all this fervor over closing Gitmo, I have a question.?	How long should we hold on to people suspected of terrorism without a charge, without proof that could be proven in a court of law and does this not violate our freedom-loving society and habeas corpus?  If we sell out our ideals and the principles of our constitution, what do we have left to conquer the world but air craft, navel, missles and soldiers?  Furthermore, how can the right (not including the libertarians in the crowd) claim to cherish our freedoms while denying it to others?
20090128125153AApmvc6	Politics & Government;Politics	LEFT AND RIGHT - will you accept this challenge?	The media (and Obama) is lying to you.   A challenge you to read this bill... Yes it is long, and I know a lot you will say things like "it is not my job"... Then who's job is it?      Just read the bill and see if it makes sense to you. Which parts of it will "stimulate" the economy? Money to agriculture, money to infrastructure projects that won't start (by law) for at least 2 years... All sorts of state pork...      Just read it. I DARE YOU!    http://www.docstoc.com/docs/3779438/HR-1... 
20090128122446AAkQ5YE	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this yet another economic reality that the YA Conservatives do not understand?	Obama said he would change the way that Washington does business.  So now that he has reached out across the aisle to get support from the Republicans for the stimulus package, and there is a truly honest debate taking place between the President and Republican leadership so that it will be a true bipartisan effort, there are YA Conservatives who think that he is simply trying to avoid responsibility for the package if it fails.      What the YA Ideologues do not seem to get: If the package is successful, the Republicans can take credit for WORKING with the President instead of fighting against him.  If they do not, and it fails, they can be blamed for hamstringing a popular President's best efforts.       This is truly a political irony.  If he let the Congress pass the bill without Republican input, which he can do because we have the majority, then the YA Conservatives would call it a dictatorship.  But if he acts in a bipartisan manner, trying to engage the Republicans he is trying to avoid blame.       You can't have it both ways...Obama is doing what he said he would do, and that is why he won, and why he enjoys such high approval ratings.  If the YA Conservatives don't get this, I sure hope the Republican leadership does, because otherwise 2012 will be a cakewalk.

20090128125032AAMYvQJ	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the USA the only one bound to NAFTA?	i dig that NAFTA is all about keeping the money spread out, not letting any small countries literally die out, to keep the larger countries from getting too big and to stimulate world economy. good idea poor plan in my opinion, too many corperations out there that are quick to expliot NAFTA's weakly thought rules. BUT what im wondering is does all the other countries have to obide to NAFTA and screw their economy to crap?   so a small 3rd world nation can get a crap facility factory making products for dirt cheap all while pumping their waste striaght into the oceans or rivers.
20090128124101AAlDuNG	Politics & Government;Immigration	Restrictions on legal aliens in Proposition 187?	Did California's Proposition 187 only stop illegal immigrants to the USA from getting health care, education, welfare, etc.? In the back of my mind I seem to remember it also placed restrictions on legal immigrants who had only been US residents for 5 years or less? I can't find anything supporting this on Google, but I'm sure that was on of the clauses in it! The only thing I think I could be getting mixed up with was some bill that Clinton's government passed that restricted immigration and hired more border patrol teams - if anyone knows what that bill was called it would be greatly appreciated, too! Was this the case with Prop. 187?

20090128130147AA8ZKDP	Politics & Government;Military	Military spouses who work outside the home?	I have been wanting to go back to work since my youngest started school. But I see no clear way of doing it.  We PCS'd to Beale about 2 months ago and we are living off base for the first time. I walk the kids to school, one starts school at 8:15 till 2:30 and the other 8:30 to 1:15.  We have one car that my husband uses everyday.  We just found out last night that he had to go on a TDY for a few weeks starting today (this is typical).  We live about 30min from base which complicates things a bit more.  I would love to know how do military spouses work outside the home?  Especially with one vehicle to share.  I thought about working like a graveyard shift somewhere but my husband is gone alot and i do not know or trust anyone around where i live. So how do you do it?
