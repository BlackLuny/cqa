MSEyXHFWaa	Art: The Complete Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson.<br>  That would be the funnest art to be. Ever. Of course art snobs won't consider this to be "real art". "Real art" must convey deeper thought and emotion and not have speech bubbles.<br>  **** the critics. I like Calvin and Hobbes. It's art enough if I can distinguish the characters. It's good art if it makes me laugh.<br>  <a href="http://www.amureprints.com/img1/Calvin/1993/ch930720.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.amureprints.com/img1/Calvin/1...</a><br>  <br>  Lit: I'm not sure what book I'd be, but I would choose JK Rowling and Dean Koontz's bastard love child to write it. <br>  Hmmm...<br>  I choose...

Pianos are expensive and people aren't likely to neglect you. The piano I used to play on was over 100 years old and still going strong. As far as instruments go, I don't think you can beat the piano in terms of granduer or longevity.<br>  <br>  Movie: I pick "The Emperor's new Groove" (Childish, I know, but I loved this movie anyway).

Calvin and Hobbes are great!)<br>  <br>  Literature/Poem ~ At the moment, I'd like to be either Wallace Stevens' "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" [<a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stevens-13ways.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/8...</a> ] or Philip Larkin's "The Trees" [<a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-trees/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-trees...</a> ]. I'll get back to you on the literature.<br>  For the moment, I'd want to be "Flowers For Algernon." Or Finocchiaro's "The Galileo Affair," which is a collection of (translated) letters of correspondence between Galileo and everyone else involved in his trials. I loved reading it for class.<br>  <br>  Song ~ I just finished watching part of The Lion King (for the billionth time) with my sister, so I'll choose "The Circle of Life." Music is definitely not my forte.<br>  <br>  Instrument ~ Maybe a violin? Almost anything but clarinet! We had to take band in 4th&5th grade, and honestly, for no reason whatsoever, out of all the instruments that were available, and having the privilege of picking first, I chose clarinet. I couldn't play it at all, you couldn't even hear Mary Had a Little Lamb when I blew my hardest. I so wanted to play drums, but it was too late in the year to switch. . . So, violin :)<br>  <br>  Movie ~ I'm an animated movie, and I choose "Mulan" :) I'm just not a movie/TV person, I haven't watched too much that wasn't animated. As for actors/actresses, I'm clueless. <br>  <br>  I'm terrible at this. Can I come back later and answer?

3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	If you're referring to a tribute band, yes. The Australian Pink Floyd show is a good one. But when it comes to Pink Floyd, there's nothing like seeing them. I had the good fortune to see several of their concerts live and they were awesome. Some of the best Lazer light shows you'll ever see. Those were the days when you could afford to go to a concert and they really put on a show.|`|ji8J9k6Baa	Concert w/ laser light show?  yep~ Im a 60/70's child...I honestly do not remember if it was during the 70's or 80's that it grew to be such a big thing in my area....I was a big concert hopper back in the day.<br>  <br>  What WAS really cool for me~ was when 'the wall' was just out~ its when I went to Germany and Austria on a school trip....and we went to a club there (w/ light show inc.)...of course there we were able to drink at our young age as well.(think i was 16 or so)...it was so cool hearing 'The Wall' over there, it was just as popular there as it was in the states where we had just left.|`|c52cbd262f9bbe8b25813042e1adaf6caa	Yes, back in the early 90's I went to a Pink Floyd show at the Hayden Planetarium in NYC.

Klb4ZYcVaa	The only good horror movie i've seen with Depp was Sweedney Todd, & he should keep it that way. Even if you get Al Pacino doing it, the movie will STILL suck, simply b/c it's a Freddy Vs Jason movie.|`|0brkUyGgaa	No. Dracula is a different kind of villain from Freddy and Jason. A better film would be "Dracula vs. Frankenstein", which I bet someone has made before.<br>  <br>  A better choice would be Pinhead or Michael Myers. However, the ultimate best choice would be Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash Williams from the Evil Dead series, due to the fact that a comic exists entitled "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash".
CvahPOtNaa	wow! <br>  <br>  everyone is soo mean here! but sadly i dont think you can send someone to the police just report them..<br>  <br>  <br>  im sorry :(|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	How did you differentiate; at least 99% of us on here are pervs.|`|qcxSTYjZaa	i agree with the first answer <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *blocked*|`|sMvWJDqsaa	unfortunately I think you can only report to the Yahoo Answers site under the report abuse link...but maybe they would have some ideas on what to do..especially if this person is harassing you personally..otherwise, it's hard to report someone from cyberspace to the police because you don't know their real identity..and the police would have to get a tech nerd to investigate the IP address of the computer etc...they probably would not want to take the time...|`|7Ce2oC9Yaa	block him<br>  turn off your email<br>  make your q&a's private<br>  delete your fans and contacts and don't allow anymore<br>  <br>  try that for a while and see if it works<br>  <br>  If this person seems to know who you are and/or  where you live report them to the police.  Yahoo says they cooperate with all law enforcement agencies.|`|TXaMOQo6aa	i agree wif da 1st answer|`|x7duxnBLaa	Call the police and run it past them and see what they say.  Just call the nonemergency number and tell them.  I've done it myself a few times concerning events in my community.  If he threatened you or you have other reasons you feel are justified, that's your right.|`|qwInrvUGaa	most people are pervs on here especially in this category<br>  <br>  and the perv is most likely a troll<br>  <br>  and the police do have better things to do than arrest people who are being "pervy" on yahoo answers unless they are a child molester/rapist|`|fJFgoYo4aa	i'm pretty sure there's no way. but is it even a big enough deal to get the police? idk i guess you could go undercover with a new screen name and try to become friends with him, then get his address and tell the cops to go there|`|eta0c25yaa	lol many people are perverted on here. The police won't do crap. Just block him. There is a block link on top of the avatar.. simple :)|`|qb3YcUaGaa	You could report the person to the main Y!A then tell them to report him to the police|`|SdDvbPf0aa	wate of time honey, just report him to yahoo answers and they'll delete his question or answer|`|rYdsywgyaa	I don't think there's much you can do but Report Abuse.|`|lnMav7jYaa	Get over it, they have better things to do like eat donuts.|`|ihS1d5Ftaa	just report them or block them|`|Io7x29vhaa	Block him :)|`|SjhOYEozaa	why do you care. just shut up.|`|bSW3WQs7aa	what did he do depends on how serious what did he do?|`|xJyEhiHeaa	you have to report rebus on him or her.|`|Zupw5rilaa	Don't waste your time, just block him.|`|0deO62tvaa	its not illegal to be repulsive<br>  <br>  although i wish it was|`|1wNsBNmxaa	seriously there is nothing yahoo answer would be able to do any thing to the prev because they do not know his real name or address where he lives so reporting him would be the only thing you can do in get his account suspended off yahoo answer for good or just block him so he can not follow you any where<br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|PpWosZsIaa	There should be a website with your local Police Department for you to Report Cyber Stalkers.<br>  <br>  You will need to track the insults and inappropriate contact and send this to the Police.|`|seJxUXHCaa	you pick up the phone<br>  dial the police number<br>  tell them what's going on<br>  & they'll investigate.<br>  <br>  but really; it's yahoo answers, who gives a sh*t? the police won't give a damn--it's a waste of your time & theirs. just report the guy to yahoo answers and they will track his IP address and block him from yahoo answers; for now just block him. it's just that simple.|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	idk<br>  but i think when u report u put its illegal<br>  never done it but try|`|BswVoF8Paa	You cant report it to police, but you can report his answers only. If you think its illegal, then use the second bullet thingy|`|guOkujOraa	Well no I think you should just report it on Y!A and block them.|`|CoEVVkNhaa	You can't report them to the police.|`|INf502UUaa	You can't.|`|9ntoGPFyaa	The Police? You mean the band?|`|KAkiPY3kaa	It will be a waste of their time and yours, just block him|`|f4iszDZuaa	Just report him on Y!A and click on the illegal tab....|`|zhrGiQsKaa	oh shut up. it is yahoo answers. who cares.|`|PD1WpoEsaa	thats not right babe!|`|YW1DXceqaa	hahaahah....Y!A will track his IP and delete him..just tell them

VM9KZ0CVaa	He never liked it when Richard made him in charge of the Island over Ben. Ben wants to be the head honcho of the island. He just had to find out how much Locke knew before he killed him off. <br>  <br>  Now Ben has knowledge of Sun's husband Jin being alive (and Locke wasn't going to bring her back, because she promised Jin...so that screws up going back and fixing things like they should be fixed too). Widmore wants to be in charge of the Island too, so they are all 3 at odds for who will be the leader.<br>  <br>  Here is an interesting scenario of how Lost goes (spoiler)...<br>  <a href="http://www.timelooptheory.com/the_timeline.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.timelooptheory.com/the_timeli...</a>|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Ben killed John Locke because it was suppose to happen. They needed a dead body on the plane as proxy for Christian Shepard. John Locke knew he would be a "sacrifice" of some kind when he left the island after putting the wheel back on it's axis. However, at the same time, I think Ben was extremely jealous of John, because it appears that John has been chosen to rule the island. Ben seemed to enter a fit of rage when he heard Mrs. Hawking's name. As with most LOST situations, we may never really find out anything.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Because once Locke told him about Eloise Hawking, Ben didn't need Locke anymore. <br>  <br>  Or so I guess. I still don't get why he was so insistent about bringing Locke back to the island. He's pretty much killed the guy twice. Maybe he knew Locke would "rise" once they got back to the island...but then why did he say he would miss him? It sure sounded like he thought Locke was dead for good.<br>  <br>  Also check out:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At5Cnu1feaFTAFFF07dYL32Y.Bd.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226074815AAvAI1C">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Wo5Ezmwiaa	Jesus! Don't put that in the question title!! Put spoiler alert. I've been missing out on LOST lately, but planned on catching up. Ahhh man!|`|LBovv7Sxaa	you're a butthead for not putting a spoiler warning.<br>  <br>  so i will not answer your question.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Thanks for ruining it for me, jackass.|`|FhoKLOqHaa	he's a bastard, i actually think that now charles widmore and his people are the good guys and ben is actually the bad one, but then again, he did bring those crazy people to kill the people on the island and the c4's. But Ben seems to lie about everything, but i don't understand that if he killed him, whats the point of bringing him back to life becuase he told Jack Locke has to go back too. he's a confusing guy|`|zOYkz3M5aa	Im not exactly sure, but i wanted to reach in there and beat the crap out of ben :(<br>  I think it had something to do with how Ben got beat up or something...? im don't remember how he got beat up, like how he was all bruised and black and blue when he arrived at the terminal for the plane. Maybe him getting beat on had something to do with the woman that John mentioned right before his death (daniel Faraday's mother), the thing that triggered ben when john mentioned it.  Maybe the woman (i forgot her name, sorry) had ben beat up because he didn't get all the people back...? i don't know, because maybe it did tell how ben got black and blue, i don't remember. But, weren't you SO happy when it showed john alive on the island?! :) i couldn't stop smiling. haha, lol. hope i helped your curiosity.|`|QUtXOobmaa	Actually, I was not looking for anything related to lost when I saw the heading "Why did Ben kill Locke?"  I can thank Google for that when it listed this in interesting items.  It would still be nice to be warned of a spoiler alert, and maybe, just maybe I would not have learned about that critical piece of information before I saw the show.|`|7nSgYQnQaa	you morons who are complaining about not having a spoiler alert should have perhaps thought before checking out a LOST DISCUSSION BOARD! Why would you log onto a Lost discussion board? What were you expecting, people to be talking about Season 4? Idiots.

qHwI9ev8aa	I would suggest some lessons with a teacher who is more into getting you to play by ear than by following lesson books. Also nothing beats playing with a group, just being with other musicians opens you up to new ways to play and pushes you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|quzXdf8gaa	the only way to get better is practice.|`|7taeKueVaa	if you have good technique try playing the songs you have trouble with pick one of them and focus on it for a while till you get to it down. just practice songs that are a little bit more challenging|`|IJjoN3BEaa	Practice, Practice, Practice. If you're not sure what to practice, go over the hard parts in the songs you can't get.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|MtKmKDVlaa	Have you thought about going for lessons? My son did for awhile and it really helped. You obviously are at a stumbling block. Try lessons...can't afford private look into group lessons or at Guitar Place/store.

XhJuHMwQaa	I don't think so.  Robert Plant wrote those lyrics and he is a big fan of The Lord Of The Rings, which is are Christian inspired books.  And Robert Plant has never been accused of being involved in the occult like Jimmy Page.|`|WENGBNXhaa	i'll edit this when i actually listen to it (which will be a few minutes because stupid Youtube is being f'n slow)<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  ok i listened to it<br>  << i really don't care though. i mean it's a great song (that's overrated) but someone got so bored that they decided to play it backwards. they overreacted when they heard something that seemed "Satanic"|`|BRTa5h7iaa	It's just your imagination. No artist would take the time to write such a meaningful song forwards AND backwards. The backwards recording can be interpreted several ways and it just so happens that one person could pull together enough sounds to make a satanic song.|`|NC67WVlEaa	I've listened to it backwards (amazing, what you can find on youtube) and it was only slightly eerie. I think that if you play anything backwards... anything at all, your bound to hear things. That's how the human brain works. it tries to make sense out of nonsense.|`|ebxwADDcaa	not me, i saw the youtube video of the song played backwards and they didnt match up all that much, half of it sounded like it was made up.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	I think it's bull ****. They tell people what to listen for, in my opinion that's the only reason so many people can hear it.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Nope, just your vivid imagination.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i doubt zeppelin was a satanic band|`|0NpR26jfaa	Dude I tried this. I found that video on you tube, and it does sound satanic. Then again I, got the lyrics for it, sang the part they played on you tube and recorded it. It didn't sound satanic at all backwards( I'm an excellent singer so I got the tonation down). So no it's not satanic.|`|IHm8A3qKaa	I heard a section of it on YouTube. It sounds really Satanic backwards to most normal people.<br>  Then again, I could scream, roll it backwards, and somebody would interpret it as "Satan".|`|eGSIXIsFaa	It does sound a bit 'evil' to me, but the song isn't exactly meant to be played backwards :P.|`|iAEPYfcPaa	uhh... that's an odd question... lemme check youtube.<br>  <br>  eh. it doesn't sound intentional.<br>  <br>  kinda weird though...|`|niyc4VhZaa	Idiots.|`|LJJ38fVKaa	nawww don't think so...|`|kILkOc6saa	Download Audacity, record yourself singing, edit it so it plays backwards, and then tell me it doesn't sound the same.<br>  <br>  I do it regularly :P<br>  <br>  It's not satanic.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	That's just ridiculous. I swear, people have got to get lives.|`|Vkff8N8Taa	No, because if you showed the song backwards to someone, they would just hear mumbled gibberish. However, if you showed the "satanic" lyics that accompany the backwards song, they would start to think its satanic b/c of top-down processing (how you analyze stimuli around you). So, no, I don't think its a devil song.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	This video will answer all your question..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_69yvFZH9U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_69yvFZH...</a>|`|9RTuRPviaa	"There's a little tool shed where he made us suffer" ????<br>  Well NOW i'm convinced! <br>  Because we All know the story of how Satan tempted Peter at the Toolshed of Jericho...|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	To me, it's gurglish crap. It can be interpreted in many ways.

blSlwcIiaa	Better Toe Touch: <br>  <br>  There are 3 things to remember when practicing your toe touch - flexibility, height, and technique! All are important and I will give you some exercises and things to practice to improve your toe touch: <br>  <br>  A.) flexibility - 1st start stretching in a straddle sit. Then have someone push on your back to assist with your stretching. <br>  Exercise 1.) For some exercises, lay flat on your back with your hands underneath your buttocks. Keep your back on the ground and legs together, pull your legs up off the ground. Start separating your legs as you come up and eventually snap a toe touch. If you can touch your toes to the ground then you flexibility is excellent. Then on the way down bring your legs together and lay your heels back on the ground. Do this 10 times for 3 sets. <br>  Exercise 2.) Lay flat on your back with your arms straight above your head and your legs together. Start by using your abs and pull your arms down through your legs. At the same time snap a straddle snap (toe touch). Do this 10 times for 3 sets. <br>  <br>  B.) Height - Now start working on your jump and improve your height. It will give you enough time to snap your legs up and bring them back down without bending them and loosing your balance. <br>  Exercise 1.) Find some bleachers and/or a chair. Stand in front with both feet together on the ground. Now jump straight up on the chair/bleachers, and then back off. Do this for 30 seconds non stop for 2-3sets. This will increase your jumping ability. <br>  Exercise 2.) Have a spotter stand behind you and grab your waist. On count execute you jump. Have the spotter help lift you off the ground (just a little). This will give you the idea of what it's supposed to feel like to hit the correct height on the toe touch. <br>  <br>  C.) Technique - Know how to throw the toe touch. <br>  1.) Keep your chest up. Too many girls drop their chest and it actually makes the jump look lower than it should. <br>  2.) Do not touch your toes...kick your legs behind your arms. If you touch you toes, then it reduces the height of your jump. <br>  3.) Straight legs up and on the way down for the landing. Make sure you do not bend your legs on the way up or down. You will loose points for tryouts. <br>  4.) Land with your feet together. <br>  5.) Keep your toes pointed|`|nvRyYyEQaa	Hey my try-outs are March 12 so pretty soon!! :) I made it last year and my jumps were not good at all!! So im really trying to work on them and if you like strecth every day after school they will get better and find a clear wall and just push your self up against it then once it hurts stop then once it stops hurting stretch some more and it has really helped my toe touches well all of my jumps. :) and good luck!!! :)

HWObxgtQaa	Hi. I'm going to give you the best answers to your questions.<br>  <br>  1. The first person he helped was his brother Ben who got lung cancer and needed a double-iobe transplant and it was about a year after the accident. The second person he helped was Holly and he gave her the right part of his liver and it was about six months later. Holly is the girl which Tim went to ask her if there was someone in her system who is having a really hard time and needs help and that was Connie the Latina woman (her husband beats her and they couldn't do anything about it). We didn't see it when he helped these 2 people (his brother and Holly), but his brother explained it at the end.<br>  <br>  At the beginning, he called Ezra to test him, to see if he was a decent man. Kind. Slow to anger. He harassed him but Ezra was calm and didn't get angry so he decided he was worthy.<br>  <br>  He went into a hospital and talked to Stewart Goodman, then he went to ask that old lady called Inez to see what kind of man Stewart is and the lady told him that Stewart punished her. He was mad and said he won't give Stewart an extension (that's what Stewart wanted).<br>  <br>  He then found a girl named Emily who had a bad heart. Tried to talk to her and get to know her.<br>  <br>  After you can see that he went to the hockey arena and was watching the coach and how he was.<br>  <br>  He then went to see Holly and asked her for someone who needs help and she told him that it was Connie (the Latina woman). So he went to see her but she said that she didn't want his help. He was going to give her his house at the beach. You can see why he moved into a motel because he wanted to give someone his house. He left his card to Connie.<br>  <br>  I'm explaining to you in order. So then he went to meet the coach and donated his liver to him. The coach asked him "why me?" and he said that he was a good man even when he doesn't know that people are watching him (Tim went to observe him at the hockey arena earlier). <br>  <br>  He then went to see Ezra the blind man at the restaurant. Ezra was telling the waitress about giving a FREE piano lesson to her kids I think and Tim smiled because he saw that he was a good man again. So he went to talk to him then left the restaurant and called his name when he said good night to him, leaving Ezra surprised.<br>  <br>  Emily fainted and was in the hospital and called him and wanted him to tell her a story. The story he told her was referring to his case, what happened to him, his wishes, his intentions.<br>  <br>  Then when he was in his motel room, Connie called him and said she needed his help, so he gave her his house contract and told her how to get to the beach house, assured her that her husband won't find her and told her to be strong.<br>  <br>  He then donated bone marrow to a young black boy (he watched him when he was eating with his brother and mother near the beginning and saw he was a good kid). That's the reason why he was limping on his way to his motel room.<br>  <br>  OK. Now it's getting interesting because the movie director wanted to tell us two things. Tim began to fall in love with Emily and wanted to see if he could stay alive so he went to the hospital and asked the doctor if there was any optimism about Emily. From the moment the doctor told him that the chance goes to 3 or 5 percent, he knew that he had no choice and had to give his heart to Emily. The director wanted to tell us two things: Tim wanted to pay back for the 7 lives he destroyed by killing himself in the end but also, it was his love for Emily that killed him.<br>  <br>  So in other words, the seven people he helped was his brother Ben, Holly, the coach, Connie, the young boy, Emily and Ezra.<br>  <br>  2. I guess the question # 2 is already answered.<br>  <br>  3. The movie is entitled "Seven Pounds" because of seven "pounds of flesh". Look up "pounds of flesh".<br>  <br>  4. The blind guy is Ezra, and yes, he was one of the seven people. He donated his eyes to him.<br>  <br>  5. The guy was Dan, his best friend. When he went to his motel room, he told Tim that he has known him his whole life and that he wasn't going to let him down. But Tim told him to do what he promised him. I think Dan agreed that he was going to help his best friend Tim whenever he needed his help when they were little so that's why he kept his promise. Tim wanted him to see that his wishes are carried out after he is dead.<br>  <br>  The main protagonist's (Will Smith) name is Tim. He had to pretend to be Ben because his brother Ben works for the IRS and he stole his IRS ID to access the IRS database and find people worthy of his gifts.<br>  <br>  Seven Pounds is a formidable movie and is one of my favorite movies. I love it. 10/10<br>  <br>  By the way, the director of this movie is the same as the one of The Pursuit of Happyness. Another good movie. But I like Seven Pounds better.<br>  <br>  I hope all this answers your questions, shpunk14. The movie is a lot better if you understand the whole plot with clarity. I watched it 3 times. Not because I didn't understand, but because I loved it.<br>  <br>  Note: HAVI's post was wrong when he said that the seven people were Holly who found for him to aid. He only asked her for one person which was Connie. He found the rest of the people by himself, by accessing the IRS database with the ID of his brother. And by the way, Holly doesn't work for the welfare, she is a child services worker. It was written on her office door.<br>  <br>  I didn't mean to say that you didn't give the correct answers, HAVI. I was trying to clarify it. I do appreciate you trying to help answering shpunk14's questions.|`|ELIKp5tDaa	in the crash in the beginning of the movie, there were 8 people involved...7 died including his gf/wife who he was with in his car<br>  he felt obviously horrible about it adn wanted to help seven people *his seven pounds of flesh* he was testing the blind guy, and the girl with the bad heart to see if they were worthy recipients of his internal organs after he died<br>  will smith picked seven people he could help if he died<br>  his heart went to rosario dawsons character, his corneas to teh blind guy and so on and so forth<br>  by killing himself at the end of the movie, he made it so 7 more people could live or have better lives....<br>  he felt like he had to give something back to the world because he took 7 lives<br>  <br>  <br>  7 pounds the movie title represents the '7 pounds of flesh' he gaveup|`|HBUO10i7aa	OK HERE GOES.....<br>  <br>  1) DESERVING PEOPLE THAT THE WELFARE LADY HE HELPED FOUND FOR HIM TO AID.<br>  <br>  2) BY EITHER BODY PARTS OR OUTRIGHT GIFTS, (THE HOUSE FOR THE BATTERED FAMILY.....)<br>  <br>  3) THE SEVEN POUNDS OF GUILT SPOKEN OF IN THE BIBLE.<br>  <br>  4) HE IS ONE OF THE 7 WHO RECEIVES NEW CORNEAS FROM WILL SMITH AND IS ABLE TO SEE AT THE END OF THE FILM.<br>  <br>  5) THAT WAS HIS LAWYER FRIEND WHO SET UP ALL THE LEGAL WORK FOR EVERYONE TO RECEIVE EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO LEAVE.<br>  <br>   YOU'RE VERY WELCOME...IT WAS A GREAT SHOW.|`|9tMh9QXiaa	1) I'm not sure who the seven people were. <br>  <br>  2) He gave parts of his organs to each person. <br>  <br>  3) Not sure.

I read somewhere someone said it's too similar to her life and it's released during a devastating time.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	because it mirrored her own life and it also made her look like a snob.|`|43982f7c9841f1d021fea87cfe60bc89aa	i liked the movie when it first came out, but i think people like her better as just an artist and not as an actress as well...<br>  just my thought|`|G68ifXX8aa	the movie was ok but ive senn better and i never heard the soundtrack|`|8ZUVToXgaa	The soundtrack, I don't think was actually hated.<br>  <br>  It has a 4/5 at amazon.com.......so that's not bad. <br>  <br>  A lot of albums have 4.5/5 ratings, but 4/5 isn't bad.<br>  <br>  But the movie from what I saw was nothing special.

UJOEtkKraa	Because L was taunting Light, and Light hates to lose or be taunted. (He is very immature sometimes.)He just thought killing L would make the police force fear him.<br>  <br>  Also, Light probably thought that Lind Taylor's death would slow down the investigation, and leave no clues.|`|fAhBYFZnaa	'Cause L was taunting him, he got really annoyed and thought killing him would scare the police and leave them without the best detective they had, but L was tooo smart and tricked him ^_^ Go L :D<br>  <br>  Also 'cause he did want to kill anyone who got in his way, which is what L was doing.

Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends.<br>  <br>  Here's how the scam works:<br>  <br>  Two seriously good-looking 20-21 yr old girls come over to your car as you are packing your bags into the trunk. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. Its impossible not to look. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' and and instead ask you for a ride to McDonald's.<br>  <br>  You agree and they get in to the back seat. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over you while the other one steals your wallet.<br>  <br>  I had my wallet stolen December 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, and again on the 17th, 20th, 24th &29th. Also January 1st & 4th. Twice on the 8th, again on the 16th, and 20th, two times yesterday and very likely again this upcoming weekend.  So tell your friends to be careful.<br>  <br>  P.S. Walmart has wallets on sale for 2.99.

N8N9JwOfaa	If you want examples of things that are hidden in every episode (like the examples you give):<br>  <br>  In many episodes, you can find evidence of Bart's vandalism. You can see it on the side of the Kwik-E-Mart, trash dumpsters, and the steps of City Hall: "EL BARTO"<br>  <br>  Neologisms - newly created words used in the show - my favorite has always been from the "Lisa the Iconoclast" episode in season 7: "Embiggen" and "Cromulent" as in "'A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man' is a perfectly cromulent phrase."|`|d6u9lmcuaa	Assal Horizontology<br>  <br>  First coined by Dr. Nick Riviera, in "King-Size Homer" where Homer Simpson tries to gain weight to get on workers' compensation. While prescribing a diet consisting of a steady gorging process for Homer, he suggests that it be combined with assal horizontology. One interpretation is that this is the condition of one's *** becoming increasingly horizontal (i.e. wider); more likely, it refers to the position of the ***: horizontal, i.e., sitting or lying down, rather than vertical, which would require walking or standing. (Since "ology" denotes "study of" a thing, it would be more accurate to say Assal Horizontology is the study of horizontal asses, while the condition of having an horizontal *** might be called Assal Horizontism.)<br>  <br>  Assbutt<br>  <br>  A derogatory term originally spoken by Jimbo Jones: "Oh yeah, prove it assbutt!"<br>  <br>  Avoision<br>  <br>  In the episode "Bart the Fink" Kent Brockman conflates the words avoidance and evasion to create avoision. It is evident someone in his earpiece corrects him and Brockman responds to them on-air. "I say avoision."<br>  <br>  BBBQ<br>  <br>  A variation of the BBQ abbreviation for barbecue. Homer's invitations in "Lisa the Vegetarian" read, "Come to Homer's BBBQ. The extra B is for BYOBB." When Bart asks what the extra 'B' is for in BYOBB, Homer replies that it's a typo<br>  ......<br>  <a href="http://www.dvdorderonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdorderonline.com</a>

RTjqa3sNaa	First of all, songs usually need a set of Verses, pre-chorus (opt.), chorus/refrain, and bridge.<br>  Verses are the usually the beginning to the song but some cases a song might start with the Chorus.<br>  Chorus's is the part of the song that you go back to (hence refrain), after verse/verses.<br>  Bridges are where the music changes up a little bit, and are usually followed by going back to the chorus.<br>  <br>  In my head there are three parts of a song, the background music, the lyrics and the vocal notes/melody of the lyrics. (yes, i might be wrong but this is my opinion)<br>  <br>  Lyrics are the easiest for me to come up with, background music is second, and the melody of the lyrics is the hardest for me.<br>  <br>  I would like to say all songs have to rhyme, but there are some Heavy-Metal groups that have songs that do not rhyme or even make sense. But usually, most songs have rhymes in it. All in many different patterns. Ex: A,B,A,B     A,A,B,C and etc,<br>  In my head also, I believe that if like the first verse uses a specific pattern of rhyming, all the verses have to.<br>  <br>  These lyrics are really good, however, you might have to add a couple more rhymes (not all rhyming).<br>  Make some more statements (lyrics) that mean a lot and get at the soul.<br>  <br>  I wrote over 20 love songs in 5 months or less.<br>  Out of 20, I only like a couple, around like 5 or more.<br>  It's not a very high percentage but in my head I just don't like it.<br>  Whenever I show my friends the lyrics they are always like, "REALLY GOOD! HOW'D YOU COME UP WITH THIS!?!?!"<br>  I answer by saying, " I sit up in my bed at night and just think in the quiet.<br>  <br>  I suggest writing in a quiet peaceful place. A song is like a personal page of a diary, until it's finished. Even after the song is finished you might still not want to show it. Think of everything that comes to your mind about the subject of the song. Phrases, words anything! Write it all down in a list form. Then on another piece of paper, write down your song using some of your favorite phrases/words from your list. Add adjustments anywhere. And try to keep a 'groove' going through your head when writing your song, it will definitely help you in the end.<br>  <br>  With these lyrics, I recommend finding a common, soulful chorus and make it your chorus. Then find some Verses (maybe 1,2, or possibly 3). Then finding a bridge. Once you are happy with everything (the lyrics), I would suggest getting the hard part done with and find the melody of the lyrics first. Then make up a background music for the song.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this will help or not, but I hope it does.<br>  But, hey, I'm a 13 teenage boy, I don't know your age but what I wrote makes sense to me. And hopefully it makes sense for you.<br>  <br>  These lyrics are great, nice flow, great rhymes (needs a little more like I said). You just need to find out the recommended structure for a song. (ex: intro(music), verse 1, 2 pre-chorus (opt.), chorus, back to intro (music part but shortened), vesre 1 or 2, chrous, bridge, then chorus again. Well, this is the structure for most of my songs.<br>  <br>  Like I said, nice lyrics. Remember, have fun writing your songs. They are your creations.<br>  <br>  P.S. sorry if this is a little out of place or anything like that<br>  Yahoo doesn't give big enough boxes! lol<br>  <br>  Any more questions just e-mail me!<br>  <br>  <Sam>|`|cXn3Rhwaaa	Its a good song. In my opinion, you need more rhymes. And you should listen to Sam. His songs are awesome and what he says is correct.

"phobic" means an irrational fear or anxiety of something, and nobody is afraid of gays.  some people simply don't like them because they think they're gross, but "homophobic" would not properly describe them.|`|RgAVm7zCaa	Definitely not. Homophobes are ignorant and conceited. Most of the homophobes I know's reason for being homophobic is they are scared that their gay friends might get a crush on them. Seriously, just because someone is gay doesn't mean they like everyone and want to have sex with them. This annoys me to no end.

In a more recent example, Speilberg and Will Smith I think are collaborating on a remake of the Korean film Oldboy, which is a bad idea..|`|YrrtMS5Taa	THANK YOU! My God, I have been complaining about this for years, I am so happy to finally find someone else who agrees. It makes me upset for a lot of reasons, one of which is we never even mention it's not ours. Another is that people think the American remake is what the film is supposed to be, so they'll never watch the original, when most of the time it's been mangled into something totally different. We Americans don't seem to be so good with suspense or actual horror, so we compensate with gore. And then it's just some God awful teen flick. It also upsets me that we don't even try to write our own plots anymore. Almost every movie being released is a remake, be it of an old film or one from another country.

nMc1TKJaaa	I'm a huge huge fan of his as well & I listen to all his songs non-stopply just like U, but here is what I think. Although he wanted to make a different album with different kinds of singing & music as he himself said so, he sang the 2 songs "Into U" & "Make Up" like a girl, rising up & down his voice; even in a dirtish way & even the songs "Repalse" & "My Baby" are not so good actually. Maybe because of these 4 normal, not great songs it hasn't been sold as it should've been.|`|mZUXkeyRaa	I LOVE Jesse too!<br>  I go to all of his concerts!<br>  I dont know why it didnt do well<br>  I thought it was ok, not one of his bests though<br>  <br>  I guess people arent that interested in him anymore<br>  Which is werid, because his song "Leavin" was on the Itunes top 10<br>  I dont know though....|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Well I think it was the style change.<br>  <br>  Isn't it a more urban/dance-flavored album?<br>  <br>  His second album is my favorite, the rock-oriented one. <br>  <br>  There were only a few tracks I didn't care for on that one.<br>  <br>  He did his thing on Right Where You Want Me.<br>  <br>  That's also the only one I own.<br>  <br>  I've heard many songs from his first.|`|43982f7c9841f1d021fea87cfe60bc89aa	im a huge fan as well, but i think the sales were down because it has been a few years since he put out an album. <br>  plus, the extended version of the cd is coming out on april 7th, which has 4 new songs and the remix of how do you sleep with ludacris!<br>  and dont forget that leavin' was his first number one song!!!!|`|AA11986298	how could it of not sold alot?! this is jesse freakin' mccartney we're talking about! people just don't know good music these days when they hear it!!! i've loved every single song that he has put out! i'm a  huge jmac fan, and always will be! i hope when the new cd comes out people pay atttention to his music! he is the best! i want his cd sales to go up!

Saving Private Ryan-I find this movie repugnant morally because it condones war crimes by Americans;<br>  3. The Dirty Dozen--Ditto<br>  4. Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan--note Shatner screwed up the greatest possible lead in from a series episode to a movie with his ham acting and the "watering down" of the Khan character played by the immortal Ricardo Montalban. <br>  <br>  I need to think more as I try to block out bad movies from my memory; but almost anything on the Lifetime Channel is a candidate for the stinkers.|`|ewAKksKWaa	VERY VERY BAD MOVIE - Cloverfield.<br>  Gave me a migrane. i still cant believe i sat through the entire movie.<br>  bad acting, bad directing, bad effects, bad everything|`|fuFSaMfhaa	There are too many good/bad movies although there are some amazing foreign films.

Catsy82Caa	congratulations you have just learned that pop music is mass-produced|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	It's what the Disney-generation is accustomed to. They are told they will like it and they do so. Happily I have never heard a note of the tripe. <br>  <br>  The generation that has grown up digital demands immediate gratification of whims (as does an infant) and does not wish to be made to think about their environment or actions, therefore their music will be accordingly packaged and made according to formula so as not to disturb their illusions, and keep the status quo alive and well. They rebel only against what the parent corporations say to rebel against... It also explains why there's so many young people on this site asking questions that are obviously for their schoolwork which was assigned to them in order to force them to think for themselves, which they are neatly sidestepping in favour of information that is neither verifiable nor recognized by their educational institutions to the best of my knowledge. "I found it on the Internet" is NOT an acceptable reference.<br>  <br>  A counter-question: in an age where popstars emerge ever younger, is there really a reason to have the Mini-Pops? Furthermore, is it appropriate in this current society rife with exposed pedophilia that said 'Mini-Pops' should sing 'R&B' and Hip-Hop songs containing explicit lyrics and performing suggestive dance routines? That said, why is it that even Disney's manufactured pop starlets are basically presented as sex-objects in a society where even fantasizing about them leaves one prone to censure? <br>  <br>  Why is the first thing many young female singers and actors do when they reach the age of 18 is do a spread in Playboy or Hustler? I do not recall any young male singers or actors doing the same in Playgirl etc., nor are they invited to do revealing photo shoots by glamour magazines (ie. Vanity Fair). Why do we accept the double standard even now? When did feminism turn into GGW?<br>  <br>  To answer your question unfortunately leads to too many others, I am sorry but this is the best I can do. In a world flooded with sense-stimuli there seems to be no drive on the part of the parents to teach their children how to tell the gold from the dross, nor how to properly phrase a question, nor even how to do anything without first asking everyone they know if 'it's cool' or if it's a 'good idea' - the drive for external approval even from completely anonymous strangers is stunning in its illustration of the vapidity of modern culture.|`|ZmmhPX6caa	I think there are two things to consider -<br>  <br>  1)  There is a difference between "art" and "entertainment".  The garbage that Disney produces is solely for entertainment.  When the Jonas Brothers sit down to write a song (or are more likely handed a song to do) they aren't thinking about breaking any musical barriers, they are thinking about breaking the bank.  So they go for catchy, not-to-deep fodder.  But,<br>  <br>  2) Why do some (a lot) of people find this stuff entertaining?  That is all up to the listener.  I am sure you and your friends have argued over a band, or movie, or anything because of personal taste.  A lot of people just want to turn on their iPod and have a catchy tune going and not have to think about the songs.  And what is more mindless than a Disney tune?|`|V0yfiPlBaa	haha. you are so completely and utterly right! i mean, none of them even have good voices and it drives me up a wall. i was driving today and miley cyrus' new song came on the station and i almost crashed because i was trying to change the station as quick as possible. seriously!<br>  but no, i don't get it at all either. maybe everyone just enjoys self inflicted torture? that's my only guess. at least you (and i) have common sense and don't enjoy that crap as well. at least there are a few sane people left!  :)|`|oAjBt4VVaa	all music is subjective man.<br>  <br>  I hate all that kind of music too, we just have to ignore it, regardless of how many times it's thrust into our faces every single time we turn on the television and browse the net. <br>  Counter-balance this bad, shovelware music with some ace music like Radiohead or Boards Of Canada.

bVymcqoQaa	I'm assuming since you're asking this you're a relatively young oboe player. The best advice for you is to get a private lesson instructor if you don't already have one and bring up the issue with them. A private teacher will be able to see exactly where you are and evaluate what you need. There are probably plenty of people that can give decent advice on this website but they won't be able to give you the best advice that a private instructor will since they can actually see and hear you. You're going to have to learn to make your own reeds if you keep playing so you might as well learn now.|`|h6JJNgoKaa	IN my experience as an oboe teacher, I have found that the Emerald Brand (a new brand out)  It is a brand that is machine carved not ground is probably what you are looking for.   As to strength you probably need to discuss and play for a qualified teacher to find exactly what you need.

yas23v7laa	if you feel that way you should find someone to talk to.<br>  <br>  and weather you can tell or not you are the most important person in someones life. and im not lieing here<br>  <br>  people you would be able to talk to about this, are like a close family relative, or a close friend. <br>  <br>  i guarentee you that someone will talk to you if they knew your life was endanger.<br>  <br>  think about your self. and what you would have if you werent here. hope i could help you chicky :) if it matters i would be very sad to find out you were gone after i sent you this letter, after a total stranger took the time out of their day to help you with your life|`|XUrgcOMDaa	I think everyone feels like that sometimes.  I sometimes have periods of what I call "social downtime", where I feel invisible among my family and friends.<br>  <br>  Facebook exaggerates this feeling, for me.<br>  <br>  But, during this time, I focus on myself... and I know that I have lots of family and friends who love me... even if there's not a lot of contact at the moment.  <br>  <br>  I think it happens more during the midwinter time, too, as this is a period of hibernation and for some, depression.<br>  <br>  Try not to feel too bad.  Spring is just around the corner, and things will pick up.  And unless you've done something to piss off all your friends and family (in which case you ought to make amends... and even then they still probably care) ... I can guarantee that there are people out there who would most certainly notice and care if you disappeared!  <br>  <br>  P.S.  Ever seen "It's a Wonderful Life?"  :)|`|1QT3dINMaa	I KNOW I can. I used to feel like that in the past but now I don't feel like that anymore, but I still know I can do it though...it'd take anywhere from a half hour to two hours..when my boyfriend calls for me or comes by or one of the kids are looking for me.|`|iYRBbpGWaa	Well, a lot of times I feel that people don't appreciate enough what I do. I just figure that if I were to ever disapear they would quickly realize all that I did for them and others, and wish they had appreciated it more.

It's kind of a bad loop that my brain goes into.  People are so much into themselves and their own world, that it can seem that nobody cares.  But then they can show incredible compassion too.   <br>  <br>  I hope you don't feel this way all the time.

372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	It might get more popular and the kids will start listening to older bands, but you can't re-create that era. It'd be a total fake, just an imitation of the 90's. But we might see a new genre influenced by grunge (not post-grunge, that stuff sucks).<br>  <br>  MQ: Soundgarden and Alice In Chains<br>  MQ2: Dave Grohl and Donita Sparks<br>  MQ3: Hate The Police by Mudhoney and Everything Zen by Bush|`|XHwhhSgaaa	Ugh hopefully!

I'm not too much a fan of grunge, but a lot of people in rock and pop seem to be. I have seen grunge described as a popular version of stoner rock, which in some respects is true. Priestess is not really grunge, but is stoner rock that does sound kind of pop-ish, so I guess it is starting t have a comeback.<br>  <br>  BQ: Alice in Chains<br>  BQ2: Kurt Cobain<br>  BQ3: "Them Bones" - Alice in Chains|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	I hope so, I would be very cool of it did, since well, grunge is awesomeness on a stick. But it won't ever be the same since like, the best of the bunch are gone(i.e. Kurt, Layne) or like...old...and stuff...have you seen Krist Novoselic? He's fat and bald, and I can't picture him rocking out on his bass that way. <br>  <br>  BQ: Nirvana, Alice in Chains...Umm...are Smashing Pumpkins considered grunge now? ah, whatever, I'll just say they're grunge.<br>  <br>  BQ2: PFFT! do you even have to ask?!?!

I don't think it would ever be as big as it was in the 90s.  Also, it wouldn't seem as authentic to me.

If we want music to go forward and progress, WE CANT let a genre repeat itself, the only way music has gotten to where it is is by making new genres and having them become the new dominating thing, even if you hate it each genre has played a role in the genre that would overtake it, so to have grunge come back is just... silly, even though I love it. So to answer no, it probably wont... unless the masses make a mistake and let it come back, then music will be set back years.<br>  <br>  BQ: Nirvana (followed by L7 and Soundgarden) edit** Hey are we counting Hole here? I don't really consider them grunge, but if so then they are number 2!!<br>  BQ2: Hmm... probably Mark Lanegan, but if we count some proto-grunge artists then Neil Young and if we count musicians who are in bands and haven't actually done anything solo than Kurt, of course<br>  BQ3: Sappy by Nirvana, Slaves and Bulldozers by Soundgarden, Rain When I Die by Alice in Chains, Wildflowers by Mark Lanegan, and My My, Hey Hey (out of the blue) by Neil Young. edit** if counting Hole, Jennifer's Body as well as well (though it changes, A LOT! and right now Best Sunday Dress sounds amazing)<br>  <br>  edit** and below at queen izzy, Krist still rocks his bass!

oCxBeEI6aa	Well, First of all that's the diameter, right? So you do the distance formula. After the distance formula, you have the diameter. Divide that by two and you'll have the radius. Let me show you. <br>  D = D = (x1 – x2)2  + (y1 – y2)2  Oh, and there's a square root over the x and y stuff. and the 2's at the end are squares, okay?<br>  Now, plug in your numbers. <br>  D = (-1 - 3)2 + (3 - 6)2 With a square root over everything but the D. <br>  D = (-4)2 + (3-)2  With a square root over everything but the D. <br>  D = 16 + 9  With a square root over everything but the D. <br>  D = 25 With a square root over everything but the D. <br>  <br>  Now, you must find the square root of 25 because it has a square root over it. The square root of 25 is 5. <br>  The diameter is 5. To find the radius, divide by two. Now you have 5 over 2. <br>  To do the decimal, use your calculator. For your answer, the radius = 2.5|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Okay...you first find the distance between the two endpoints using the distance formula or the Pythagorean one (in which you would have to make an "imaginary" right triangle. <br>  Then divide that answer by 2.<br>  <br>  EDIT-If you use the Pythagorean one, it would be best to use a graph paper.|`|qf1rY9ZDaa	GO TO THE MATH SECTION DUMBASS|`|fJFgoYo4aa	well when you graph that its def NOT a circle so i guess its a typo|`|plmMzEaCaa	ewww.. math|`|xXyy51Efaa	This belongs in the math section<br>  <br>  smile for the camera|`|xRUZkFU9aa	I would be able to if I had a pencil and paper and was right in front of you..I can't really point and write out things on here :(

Today in school we were watching a video about when R&B first came out and it showed people recording their music.. it was so raw and real.

E2VUH8Q0aa	Saturn is the key here. Saturn transits to the moon can spur depressive behaviors. Since Saturn also rules Capricorn, perhaps that is a a common denominator since Saturn tends to have a stagnating and restrictive influence on the native.<br>  Also remember that Pluto in Capricorn is in full effect and can add some oppressive to the economy as well as people's attitudes as well.<br>  <br>  You will also notice in the article that Moon in Sag is more susceptible to depression, astrologically.<br>  <br>  Good article on this:<br>  <a href="http://www.elsaelsa.com/archives/2009/02/10/how-astrology-can-help-with-depression-further-remarks-regarding-mars-and-depression-specific-to-a-saturn-transit-to-the-moon-specifically-the-moon-in-sagittarius/" rel="nofollow">http://www.elsaelsa.com/archives/2009/02...</a>|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	I'm a cancer and I say I have extreme moods. When I am happy, I'm over the top but when I am sad,  I am depressed. I guess any sign can be depressed. My Midheaven is in capricorn and I've heard that people with Midheaven in capricon never give up and patiently wait no matter how bad things are. That's me. No matter how impulsive my moon (aries) and ascendant (aries), and how melancholic my sun sign is, my midheaven capricon patiently waits for success. So I don't believe it's capricorn's fault. Let's just say, zodiacs are just tendencies. You notice how contradicting the signs in your chart are? You have several tendencies. I'm pretty sure you have strong and optimistic signs in your chart.  I was a family-oriented, scared, depressed, shy-type, a little homebody cancer growing up. but now, I am more like my ascendant-the adventurous Aries. Brave, driven,quick, and strong. <br>  <br>  Capricorns are sort of serious people. I see some of them to be a little boring sometimes but some can be hilarious (as in super!). So I guess, you have to find that sunny and optimistic side of yours. It's just probably there. All you got to do is dig it up. As they say, being happy or depressed is a choice. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Take care and cheer up! If you need a hug and a good laugh, go to some loony cancer. You'll have some romantic and really crazy laughs.|`|GTr4kX7raa	Me; Scorpio DEFINITELY.<br>  We're so emotional.<br>  I cry after every break-ups, sometimes I'm just utterly sad, but yeah.<br>  Same thing.<br>  I HAVE CAPRICORN MOON! <br>  YAYA!

Yeah I have to say that Cappy's can be pretty dark and depressed at times. I'm sure most people would say Cancer or Scorpio, but nope its Capricorn.<br>  <br>  ** I agree with the Two of Cups Saturn is key. Saturn is such a hard planet to function under that it would make anyone depressed!  I have noticed that any sign that Saturn is currently in seems to have a hard time in their life. If I'm not mistaken Saturn is in Leo right now so a lot of Leo's are catching it now.|`|TbM4K6Ytaa	cancers lol(from what ive seen btw), heaps of them ive seen get so mooooooody... it makes ya wanna leave lol coz they look so depressed|`|24bdcdc34da2c3f37a8684801cf27971aa	im an aquarius :) omg i just read my horoscope and it so freaky because its TRUE!! eghh...it gives me goosebumps|`|6BS4Oj8vaa	it dosnt matter wat sign u r

The developers, after thanking the cast and crew for all their hard work, acknowledged that they never stopped fighting for what they saw as "their vision" of the show. A specific reason for their departure was not given.[9] On February 6, 2009, after only one season as executive producers, the L.A. Times confirmed that executive producers Darren Swimmer and Todd Slavkin would not be returning for a ninth season of Smallville, should one occur. Instead, the pair would take over the CW's spin on Melrose Place. The Times also reported that Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson would continue on as executive producers if Smallville was continued for a ninth season.|`|wltWpHT6aa	don't worry it will be back soon, March 12th. <br>  the episode is called Infamous & it's gonna be soo goood.<br>  the episode is about clark revealing his secret to the world, cuz linda lake (idk if you remember her, but she was in a s6 ep.

The rest of the family talks around him and you're right when they respond it's indirectly, I guess that's what makes it so funny.|`|dbQTfR5baa	Stewie can talk and the other members of the family can hear him|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	He can't talk to them directly he is still a baby, they just talk to him like they would a baby.|`|efdd876169c125ce25a81617d02d812caa	Louis just thinks that he is incompetent little boy or at least she treats him that way, I'm guessing|`|NbjJiSJJaa	Stewie can pretty much talk to any of the fanimly members, but everybody except Brian just sorta chooses to ignore them. Because in some episodes you can see them looking at him while he talks but they just sorta not respond to what he says.

AA12381582	Yes you can see a 3d movie in a regular theater.  The projector just has to be a 3d digital projector.  It can't be the reel to reel projector that uses film.  In the past 3d movies have been in 2d and 3d, because only so many theaters have 3d digital projectors.  Not sure if Jonas is going to be shown in 2d or just 3d only becuase of the 3d in the title.  In the past to make the difference between 3d and 2d they do the following.  For a movie in 3d the 3d appears after the title in the paper and online.  If the movie is not in 3d then nothing appears after the title.  So if you want 3d just double check.  Also some theaters have a 2d showing of a movie in one room and the 3d showing in another room.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i don't think you can watch it in your normal theater. but you should call them just to be sure, they will give you all the info.|`|GX1G2yhOaa	I went to the AMC theatres and they had two types of showing- the Digital 3D one and an IMAX one( they were different things). I think the IMAX one is the same as the Digital 3D one except on a gigantic screen, so you should be able to see it just in 3D at a regular theatre. Go on their website or call them to find out.|`|1fgjbO2Zaa	you don't need to go to IMAX you can also go to AMC that's where I'm going to watch the Jonas Brothers

If everyone is missing it must be a toilet in a preschools boy's room.  How does the toilet poop on something? And who misses when they're pooping?

I would clarify the questions above in it and change either the moral to fit the quirky story or the story to fit the moral. It can still be short too.

No. Made of fail.|`|gTz8TLbsaa	That was more gross than random.<br>  It was also very uncreative.<br>  I mean, come on! Bob!? Pickles!?

wEZ3hHf4aa	I think the others wanted him gone because they were afraid of his power. "has he ever appeared somewhere he wasn't suppose to be?"<br>  <br>  He killed the bird he was thinking about; brought a polar bear to them (although i'd debate that one); and  it looks like he dreams the future.<br>  I just hope he has an episode dedicated to him and we finally get an answer to this question!|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I don't think Walt has any "special" power at all.  Afterall, The Others wanted him gone.   They don't seem to have a tolerance for children.|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	Not all the time. Changes according to the mood. Electric or Gas. He reads the horoscope every day|`|ibiO4VEQaa	i think he's similar to Desmond. Daniel says there are rules to time travel, but Desmond's special, for some reason they don't apply to him maybe Walt is the same. Walt says he has dreams about Locke. Desmond remembered his conversation with Daniel as a dream. Maybe Walt can uncontrollably time travel and he partially remembers his trips as dreams. It would explain how he just randomly appears and disappears on the island.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	He can see the future, make things happen the way he wants to...

My friend investigated it once lol and she got some really interesting info in the situation. One thing I remember her telling me is that in a duet Tupac and Biggie said "You ain't nobody till somebody kills you" so she thinks it's a conspiracy because they both got killed in the whole East coast vs West coast gang thing so she thinks they both planned it to sell records. I don't really have all the info she does but if you search it on YouTube or Google you will find tons of info.|`|yrAhVOw8aa	NOOO..???? where have you been. he died in the 90's..i'm pretty sure he got shot...and didnt run away?!?! lol<br>  hope i helped<br>  peace.|`|EnvHRU76aa	He ran away.|`|XUvaSO2Oaa	no srry honey he dided back in like da 1990s

oK9WhUkiaa	lol i know what u mean. the more anoying the tune, the more it sticks in ur mind and then u remember the advert. they even do remixes to adverts now. that Cillit Bang Barry Scott advert for example... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGooQ8yYC0c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGooQ8yYC...</a> XD madness. ive noticed that quite a few adverts over the past few months have played Marilyn Manson tracks which isnt so bad. not like the bingo one ur talking about. btw i think the words are: 'all modern girls going out together'.  'pomp pomp girls get together' lol. x|`|441GSyaMaa	Does it get stuck in your head?<br>  <br>  Does that song then remind you of the advert thus remembering what the advert was advertising?...<br>  <br>  ....Successful advert|`|70c9099e786eadd5d9cafbaceb53688caa	I entirely agree. I also hate the fact that the sound is louder when the adverts come on too. The noise of the 'background' music on tv programmes drives me mad. We're not living in the age of silent films so why the need for all the, very often unsuitable, music which drowns out everything else. I don't watch many programmes now, but if I do want to see something I always record it so I can skip the adverts completely.|`|93MPvb4Faa	Wonderful marketing technique. You remember the song and associate it with a product. Take note most of those songs are played in supermarkets.

ZyGyDLsDaa	The initial cause is Eve's problem with blackouts and changes in behavior. Here's what Wikipedia has, which doesn't add much:<br>  Eve White is a quiet, self-effacing wife and mother who has headaches and occasional blackouts.

That make syou seem irresponsible and childish. <br>  First of all, you have ot seem responsible. If your mom says no, prove to her that you're not a child, and that you can go. Don't beg because that's not how a adult acts. <br>  Second, tell her good reasons why you can go. <br>  Thirdly, if she says no because it's too expensive, then offer to pay for osme of it.

7860xGqkaa	Smiling Island of Songs by Cedella Marley Booker (Bob Marley's mom) is a great thing for younger kids, as it is the story of a young girl going to Jamaica to meet Bob Marley's mom and the songs the late Mrs.Booker sang were very catchy and well done.  that is my first choice.<br>  <br>  2nd   There are I think 3 volumes of a compilation called Reggae for Kids and this was various artists on this RAS label.  This went from classic reggae songs kids would like to sing as well as Disney favorites.<br>  <br>  If I had to go with and unusual answer I'd pick augustus Pablo whose use of a toy instrument called a melodica often had no vocals just this strange mini piano which is hand held and blown like a trumpet.<br>  his music is exotic and something most children would not hear.<br>  <br>  I am still looking for another one called Rockabye Baby Lullaby renditions of Bob Marley<br>  <br>  as someone pointed out, Ziggy Marley did do the theme for Arthur quite nicely I must say and his new album is for kids, look for it out as they say in Jamaica, soon come.<br>  <br>  as for Bob Marley,  I would recommend Legend and one song in mind<br>  ONE LOVE,  this would be a great song for little children to hear at a young age "lets get together and feel all right" is a message I would have loved to hear as a youth.<br>  in that same line Ziggy Marley has a song called "Small People" which if I remember I think he did on Sesame St. and the refrain "Small people one day must grow big"|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	Try searching for 'classic' reggae like Desmond Decker and his contemporaries... More recently, the majority of Bob Marley songs do not contain explicit references, and his sons Ziggy and Damian have continued his legacy, Damian especially.<br>  <br>  If you've ever watched 'Arthur' then you have already heard Ziggy Marley, as he wrote and performed the theme song with his band.|`|e7KoyoWsaa	would you believe jamaca has recently passed a law banning all music on the radio that pertains to sex or violence?

8039be540df1845420248ce48f6ca331aa	Most of these are tough choices. <br>  <br>  1. Dimebag Darell. Perhaps if Randy Rhoads lived a little longer he would have made a better career for himself, but I would say that Dimebag has accomplished more in his career as a musician<br>  <br>  2. Steve Vai, he's one of the better "emotional" guitar players, and he has excellent technique to accompany his soul playing.<br>  <br>  3. Jimmy Page. Even though I'm sick of hearing Stairway to Heaven, I must admit that it's an excellent solo. But I also believe that Blackmore has some incredible guitar work, but he does not have as many great songs as Page<br>  <br>  4. Michael Batio, one of the best pure technique artists<br>  <br>  5. Buckethead, I admire emotion over technique, like I've already said<br>  <br>  6. Dave Murray, although I find both of them awesome!!!<br>  <br>  7. Jimmy Page once again<br>  <br>  8. Dave Mustaine, Scott Ian is just not that good<br>  <br>  9. Yngwie Malmsteen, he's is my favorite virtuoso guitarist<br>  <br>  10. Slash. The only noteworthy solo that I've ever heard from Young is from Back in Black, and it just doesn't compare to any of the good solos that Slash has performed. I think that you should have compared Slash to Kirk Hammett.<br>  <br>  If you haven't checked out the song that I have on my account I would highly recommend listening to it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKjORYsD1jM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKjORYsD1...</a><br>  <br>   Vinnie Moore is awesome.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.<br>  <br>  Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen.

egur4HvCaa	I know EXACTLY how you feel: i'm in a singing group and in front of the people in it solos are no problemo. but in front of an audience or my family, i freeze up. <br>  <br>  first of all,if the people you are performing in are from another area, remember that they don't know you, and you probably won't see them ever again. <br>  <br>  Also when you are performing in a show or concert (this helps me) DON'T look at specific people, even your family and friends. Stare at something in the back of the room and just focus whats coming up next in the song your doing. Looking at people in the audience makes me nervous, but when i only focus on what im doing, i forget they are there|`|1lh7oQsPaa	Start singing with the people you think will be most accepting.  If you have a friend or family member that's into lots of different kinds of music they might be a little more accepting, for instance.    Also, try singing while you're just hanging around the house doing other stuff (watering plants, petting the dog, doing your toenails, or whatever) & just let the other people overhear you.  If they encourage you, get louder.  <br>  <br>  For the airy sound, you just have to concentrate on blowing less air & also, try to let the sound build so you can feel it vibrate more strongly.|`|TXaMOQo6aa	idk, but i guess you can try singing in front of one person, then two, then three, and so on?|`|AA12398373	You need to build your confidence. I have sung lead in several bands, and the best way I found to build my confidence is to go out and sing to people as much as I can. When they don't boo you off stage, or even better yet, when they applaud your performance, it's a pretty safe bet that you have a talent that people consider worth listening to.<br>  <br>  Another way to build confidence is to practice singing and record it on a tape recorder, or digital device.<br>  Play it back for yourself, and try to listen to it objectively.<br>  If you've never heard your voice on a recording before, prepare yourself for a shock. By nature, it WILL sound different. That's because we all hear our own voices through our ears like we hear everyone else, PLUS we hear our voice boxes resonating from inside ourselves, so when we hear our voices without that natural enhancement it sounds like a stranger.<br>  <br>  After years of recording my voice, and hearing it back, I now hear "BOTH" voices as one. I think it has made me a better singer, because through the process of hearing my own voice played back on a recording I have trained myself to really listen to my own voice as I am singing.<br>  <br>  Finally, nothing builds confidence more than preparedness. Being prepared requires training and practice. A good vocal coach will give you exercises to make your voice and lungs stronger, and coach you so you know what your strengths are when performing.|`|4TmcopjUaa	Hi.  You have to be confident in yourself-I know easier said than done.  Being around relatives, we have a certain standard we want to meet to impress them.  Here's an idea-just hear me out.  Try the Myspace Karaoke where you can videotape yourself or just record your voice.  Play it back to yourself after recording.  You don't have to post it, but at least, you will hear yourself from an electronic device.  If you feel good about it, post it.  This will build your confidence levels.  Just an idea.|`|BWU5s2k6aa	I know how you feel, i get pretty bad stage fright too, but u know, someone told me that music is an art, and art is something not everybody understands. like a painting, one person may see it and think 'WOW, THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!" while other might think 'what the heck is that?'. some people will like it and some wont.<br>  The thing is, you just have to remember why it is that you are singing. You aren't singing for the people around you, you're singing because you love to sing. you sing for yourself, and whether others like it or not, if YOU think you did well, then your singing was perfect. <br>  It doesn't matter what everyone else think. Just remember WHY it is that you're singing and you'll do great. =]|`|HI8yTw26aa	I cant really help with the stage fright. All i can say is just be brave and try your best. And for getting a louder sound what you need to do is to focus on your breathing. Most people take short shallow breaths and you cant get a rich sound. When you breath make a haa sound and your sholders shouldnt lift. act like you have an intertube around your stomach and your filling it up with your breath and that will help get rid of the breathiness and also try working on your diction|`|PpWosZsIaa	Picture them as clowns in the nude|`|hH1eNmUyaa	i dunno i have the same problem

Ew7hXGFtaa	I definitely agree with you dude! Hell, I'm actually wearing my slipknot tee right now!  And I think people who know me know that I'm not a poser or anything like that. The only insult I have against Slipknot is the fans. Even though I like the band a lot of slipknot fans annoy the hell out of me, especially the really fangirlish ones.<br>  <br>  And, I don't mean to insult anyone, but I really don't think hating them cause of the masks is a valid reason. If there was a band you liked with the exact same masks it wouldn't mean a thing to you.|`|9hFexadLaa	I like them, they aren't really new metal, they have guitar solos. People don't like them because of how many members they have and the masks they wear, and because Slipknot switches off between screaming and singing regularly a lot|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Hate me if you want, But I actually kinda like Slipknot.  I listened to them a lot when I was in high school and I just went to a concert 3 weeks ago.  They put on a good show!  Im starting to listen to them a little more. theyre really not that bad!!!|`|DbtS5jzEaa	they ain't that bad....just overrated majorily|`|625IwsqAaa	I like some of their stuff, and I especially like the newish direction they went with All Hope Is Gone. Corey Taylor has a nice voice and he switches between screaming and singing well. I think it's just the poser goths or whatever that ruin it by wearing their shirts all the time that makes metalheads assume it's poser metal or whatever. I LOVE nu-metal and it's nice to know that they don't claim to be anything they're not.|`|GUWkY9BTaa	Good, i was afraid I would have to yell at some metal newbie scene kid.<br>  <br>  I think the main reason people diss slipknot is because there popular.  They have a sound that is both competent and original.<br>  <br>  Edit: haha, Slipknot being a scary death Metal band...<br>  I suppose I can see them looking scary, but I think for most people that heightens there appeal.  Dont you love music your parents hate|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	You're right,they're definitly not that bad.They're better than any rap and anything on top 40 radio.|`|R2i39L0jaa	A lot of bands become uncool when they become bigger. I recall Linkin Park being huge in the metal clubs but nowadays it wouldn't be cool to play them!|`|kC3VwbfRaa	most of their stuff is SOOOO brutally simple, it`s ridiculous.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	yeah, the Rick Rubin produced album was fierce! But I think all the early masks and stuff turned some people off.|`|AgQForcYaa	I would go on and ramble, but simply---<br>  <br>  They're not my kinda metal.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i asked the same question|`|9gJtVdHCaa	i think its because there diffrent. the people don't like the fact that they are walking around in mask's, and the fact that they have like 4 drum players. and the people of today dont like nu metal/death metal (bands that scream) and they just think that it is a "scary" band with the masks.|`|lcEaQGhEaa	idk i like slipknot, they have a unique style to them. and the masks they wear just make slipknot, slipknot|`|0vm66wlcaa	Well, I put them down because:<br>  1 I think their music sounds horrible (opinion)<br>  2 Masks? WTF!?!?!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Well, valid point Adam. I just think it's silly, and it's really getting old. I don't like that some bands go for a certain shock value by dressing up and stuff. Not that I dislike every band that does that, but I think most of the time, it's kind of stupid. Alice Cooper was amazing though.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Look... I am gonna repost my answer about this Q from a week a go.<br>  <br>  hmmmm.<br>  <br>  Subpar Music.<br>  <br>  MallMetal Maggot Psycho fans always rammingthem down my throat as if the band was gods gift to metal.<br>  <br>  Their own ego. By their own words, they are apparently "the Heaviest Band EVER".<br>  <br>  Pointless memebers that contribute little or nothing.<br>  <br>  The stupid outfits.<br>  <br>  The Fans.<br>  <br>  The fact Corey Taylor actually SINGS for stonesour, but sound like rubbish with slipknot.<br>  <br>  Average guitar playing.<br>  <br>  A decent drummer, but if you liten to the amggots, he is the god of all drums.<br>  <br>  the fans.<br>  <br>  They ar ea gimmick that has gotten old. Shock Metal with no real shock value.<br>  <br>  The Fans.<br>  <br>  In general, there are about 1000 bands htat are far superior to them in every way. That would not be enough reason to hate them, except for the annoying fans that cant stop thinking they are HArcore TRVE KVLT underground MetalHeads because they listen to Slipknot.<br>  <br>  And of course, the arrogance of the band.<br>  <br>  <br>  and did I mention the fans?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ****Now, in all fairness, there are much worse bands out there, and they are probably decent, but they quite simply are in no way great, and adding a DJ and 2 pointless percussionists doesn't somehow make them unique or special.<br>  <br>  So, they are an average NuMetal band that probably would get left alone if they hadn't somehow inspired a legion of Teenage Fans who constantly go around harping on they they are the BESTEST BAND EVAH!   like a bunch of MallMetal JonasBros fans.<br>  <br>  Add into that the above mentioned humongous ego the band has over their own work, and well, basically, instead of being tereated as the average NuMetal badn they are, it is going to force people who were not inclined to care for them to outrrigth loathe them.
0vm66wlcaa	I don't usually like ska unless it has the syncopated guitar strumming rhythm, like that song.<br>  I haven't listened to much of Big D and the Kids Table, but I gotta say, that was great! Thanks, man, I might look into them!<br>  <br>  What should it have been? That was a good one, but I think "Martian Girl" by The Aquabats beats it.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLpwQ1LKGV4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLpwQ1LKG...</a>|`|qif1TQtnaa	Should have been - <br>  <br>  CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings|`|y7jbhHURaa	ghost town the specials

Jn7bt3JTaa	He has some of the most memorable lines in movies doesn't he?<br>  <br>  "awkay, awkay, awkay awkay, awkay" - Leo Ghetts<br>  <br>  "You think I'm F*ckin' funny?" - Tommy <br>  <br>  "I had one Job - Protect the Golden Jew" - Nikki Santori<br>  <br>  EDIT: in answer to your question, I think he just stepped away from acting so he didn't get too type cast. I mean, he was basically playing the same guy there for a few movies. Some actors and actresses like to step away and pick and choose their roles instead of becoming an overused money machine for Hollywood. That's just my humble guess.

ykIleAQ7aa	Well if you don't know exactly but you know it was around 12:30 pm then you should be alright with your ascendant. If you find that Scorpio doesn't sound right to you then you could either play with the time to see if at 12:45 the rising switched to Sagittarius or something like that or you could hire an astrologer to figure out your time of birth based on the events in your life. <br>  When you read those general all inclusive horoscopes on line, in magazines and newspapers, I would read both Virgo and Scorpio. <br>  I find when I read for both my sun and rising that it to be more accurate.|`|d793c7a580124b83ba4c62c6f6a962baaa	Scorpio Ascendant people have a lot of presence. There is something about them that tells the world that they are not to be pushed around. Their manner commands respect, and in some cases, fear. Scorpio rising people can be quiet or loud, but they always seem powerful and determined.  <br>  <br>  You either love or hate Scorpio rising people— they are rarely people who go through life unnoticed. In fact, some of them are confused when faced with the fact that they get such strong reactions from others. They seem to look right through people, seeing through superficiality. This can be quite intimidating to some, and intriguing to others. Scorpio rising people, in their dealings with others, look for answers by reading between the lines. Surface details are discarded when they are getting a feel for people and situations around them. <br>  <br>  Scorpio rising people value their privacy so much, it can border on paranoia. They have a strong need to control their environment and are experts at strategy. Rarely people who will blow their chances with impatience, they plan out their moves carefully and deliberately, relying on their awesome ability to feel out others and situations.<br>  <br>  Scorpio rising natives are drawn to down-to-earth, natural partners. Reliability in their partner is very important. They generally look for complete commitment and have little patience with flighty partners. More on Scorpio Rising.<br>  <br>  Celebrity examples of Scorpio Ascendant include Sean Penn, Martha Stewart, Prince, Ed Asner, Susan Dey, Chris Evert, and Penny Marshall.
41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	It of course reminds  me of your compositon at par with an Urdu poet, Chirkin who has written couplets only about "tati' and 'pishab' Try to get it and read that.

ythN9BQgaa	It's supposed to mean something sexual..<br>  <br>  For example, say if the pants you tried on are huge on you and you say "It's too big!"<br>  <br>  Then someone says "That's what SHE said"<br>  (meaning they're referring to penis size) <br>  <br>  Some others are <br>  "It's all shriveled up"<br>  "Wow this is hard"<br>  "Keep it up guys!"<br>  "I don't want to go down all the way, because I'm afraid I'll get stuck!"<br>  "Do you know how hard I had to work to keep this thing up?" <br>  <br>  THATS WHAT SHE SAID!!<br>  <br>  It's stupid yeah<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cyncity.typepad.com/cyn_city/images/2007/07/02/thatswhatshesaid.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cyncity.typepad.com/cyn_city/imag...</a>|`|gLJBnqYmaa	Well maybe you're too young to know what it means.|`|sPDkBza5aa	You'll get it.

They didn't show the switch but we can assume that Simone made the switch right after Jackie left the table. And I don't think Sheronda knew it was going to happen. Max saw the switch and that's why he followed her.
AA11111233	Pure, virginal and can do no wrong... just like Sharon Abbott claims to be on Y&R... now that's funny!  However, I believe that song to be, not about Bette Davis, but another woman who seems to look like her, and have her features and personality.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I'm sure Kim Carnes only put the "New York" thing to sound ironic.|`|gzyj2Zrsaa	New York Snow is dirty, its been tread on by millions of people.<br>  <br>  So yeah, I'm guessing it has a bit of a double meaning, in that it is something that should be pure but isn't.

Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  Grandma and Grandpa were visiting their kids overnight.<br>  When Grandpa found a bottle of Viagra in his son's medicine cabinet, he asked about using one of the pills.<br>  The son said, "I don't think you should take one Dad; they're very strong and very expensive."<br>  "How much?" asked Grandpa.<br>  "$10.00 a pill," Answered the son.<br>  "I don't care," said Grandpa , "I'd still like to try one, and before we leave in the morning, I'll put the money under the pillow."<br>  Later the next morning, the son found $110 under the pillow. He called Grandpa and said, "I told you each pill was $10, not $110.<br>  "I know," said Grandpa. "The hundred is from Grandma!"|`|bhpUw9Nxaa	i've heard it before but i liked it
NQ3XZElFaa	During the 1700's there was classical music and there was folk music. Rich people listened to classical music, poor people listened to folk music.<br>  <br>  The whole subculture of "mentally depressive kids" was probably influenced by music. There were certainly sad people in the 18th century, but they didn't really turn it into a culture. I'd guess "emo" culture has it's roots in punk culture. Ultimately complaining about the government turned into complying about meaningless crap.<br>  <br>  By the 1980's, you could listen to The Smiths or Joy Division or The Cure.<br>  <br>  Real emo music really isn't "depressive." It's just hardcore punk but more personal.|`|KwWwB22Zaa	umm...<br>  <br>  mentally depressive kids dont listen to emo. emo kids are mentally depressive. <br>  <br>  i listen to some emo, and i am not depressive at all. <br>  <br>  but, MA would be generally sad music. in the 1700s classical was just about all there was, but any song in the minor scale would do the trick.|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	My little cousin claims he's "mentally depressed" and before emo was popular he was wearing bright abercrombie clothes and listening to rap.lol|`|Sbaw7agPaa	Really..so the only reason I listen to the bands I listen to is because I'm mentally depressive? Well that's nice to know.

a62A3amuaa	I think it's pretty creative! nothing in general, just everything. the setting, characters, and plot all really pull you in. but i agree, i think it's a little rushed. maybe that's because it's still pretty short (compared to One Piece which it highly resembles) but i still go online every week to check for updates, and are happy when i find one! :)|`|UsxoEEhdaa	I like the style of the manga, it reminds me of One Piece a lot, which is my favorite manga.

e0faada9a8147280b25584d40c598fb3aa	its this guy your boyfriend? how old are you?  I think that if hes not your boyfriend you shouldn't do it. you can find plenty of guys that would want to have sex with you one because you are a girl and tow because you are virgin that's a win win for any guy. if you are way too young I m not judging you, but I say you wait you probably will find someone you love along the way. and it hurts but its different with everybody, it might hurt you a lot or a little, or it might not hurt you ate at all.|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	oh dont worry it wont hurt the guy|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	This child is so excited.|`|194195b82dfda7927256d7ba5a877a46aa	If you're so nervous, maybe that means you're not ready to have sex.

e4ecc6ecde0e449c7b00bc9bd8ce1f8daa	Simple answer: the person is stuck between being a girl and being a woman.  Anything else, I'm afraid, is beyond me.|`|AA10609641	It sounds to me like a dude that thinks he might wanna be a girl, but in the end doesn't think that it would be a good idea so he's trying to oppress those desires.

NGNeT3rYaa	I would like that and like I said before, he would fit in with that group of men just fine.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I dont think it will be Charlie unless maybe he isnt really Jared's dad. And since Jared used David's DNA to prove he was the heir and now David's DNA does not match I think that there is no other heir.<br>  <br>  In October 2006, David Vickers finds out that Asa once had an affair with David's mother, Emma Bradley, but Asa denies it. Later, David's brother Dr. Spencer Truman claims to be Asa's son, but a DNA test proves otherwise. A conversation between Asa and his longtime butler Nigel Bartholomew-Smythe hints that there is more to the story.<br>  <br>  On August 16, 2007, Asa dies in his sleep and is found by Nigel. Grandsons Cord Roberts, Kevin Buchanan and Joey Buchanan (as well as ex-wife Alex Olanov) return temporarily for his funeral. [2] On August 17, 2007 Nigel tells a returned Max Holden that Asa does indeed have another son: David Vickers. Max advises Nigel to wait to tell the rest of the family, and an eavesdropping Alex overhears. She begins a search for David herself. [15]<br>  <br>  Asa's will is executed in November 2007 as a video is played featuring the Buchanan patriarch. He bequeaths his mansion to former daughter-in-law Nora Hanen, who has been living there with her and Bo's son Matthew since her house burned down; he also leaves his yacht, the Jeb Stuart, and his tropical island, St. Blaize's, to loyal servant Nigel. Asa also notes the existence of his other son, though not his identity, and finally states that he will not be splitting Buchanan Enterprises amongst his heirs and taking the chance that the company will be split up or partially sold. He instead challenges the family to run it as a cohesive team and, if the company's stock rises, be rewarded handsomely in a year. Alex appears, married to an in-the-dark David, and blackmails Nigel with the facts of David's parentage. Not wanting the Buchanans to discover that con man David is one of them, Nigel gives his inheritance to Alex in exchange for her silence. Meanwhile, Buchanan Enterprises up-and-comer Jared Banks — an admirer of Asa's who is already a favorite of widow Renee and circling Natalie Buchanan romantically — overhears Alex's news and pressures Nigel to pass him off as Asa's heir instead. Nigel does, and Jared feigns disinterest, armed with a lock of David's hair to prove his claim.|`|ADBMrG87aa	I think it would be wonderful if Charlie turns out to be a Buchanan and it would also be hilarious because his son Jared and Natalie are a couple and if Jared turns out to be a relative then it would be incest and that would make the show more interesting. <br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	He's NOT the right age, he's in his 50s at least which would put him being born in the 50s not in the late 60s.|`|AA11334527	It would be interesting and that would make Viki fall for another Buchanan brother. She has had Clint and Ben already under her belt. But I hope he isn't, because that would be just ackward|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I don't think it's possible for Charlie to be a Buchanan. Asa's love child was supposed to be David Vickers. But when Bo and Rex went back to 1968, everything got screwed up. Bo ended up sleeping with David's mother instead of Asa. Thus, David is Bo's son and not Asa's.

2wgEsVmsaa	No. No translation ever hurt the original!|`|CXh6Seigaa	Heck yes it does. Anime is not nearly as enjoyable as manga. They usually end up straying form the story-line too much. Just like movie-versions of books or TV spin-offs.|`|MVlymbiSaa	It's not really a case of "sometimes" but "most of the time".<br>  <br>  Anime has to be, to some degree, episodic. Which can make it hard to adapt the manga into an anime. Also, anime can sometimes be cancelled whilst the manga continues, as in the case of Tsubasa Chronicle.<br>  <br>  The worst thing about anime adaptations would have to be filler, though. Most animation companies can't write good episodes.

TAS1vdr9aa	The season finale will be towards the end of March. I believe the 23rd.<br>  <br>  On Monday Amy and her mother get a job at a hotdog place. Ben and Ricky get into it about Amy and the baby (not fighting but they do exchange words) Adrianne wants to become a virgin again by asking god for forgiveness because she thinks her brother will like her better. Grace tries to help her with it. Amy's dad, Ben, and Bens dad go to the hotdog place that Amy and her mother work at and Amy's dad tells her mom how she can't work there, and she'll quit. A man comes in and works for an architects office and asks her to work for him. Ashley meets a boy and he comes over. (I think she is starting to like him)<br>  <br>  Those basically it! Don't worry though they will probably have a marathon on again soon you can catch up with that !!

I guess find a way to make him feel like hes foolish for being with you or just be an embarassing gf to have. I would imagine i wouldnt have such a hard time if my gf broke up with me then.

6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  You do not need a psychic to tell you why.<br>  <br>  The answer is because you let him! simple as that darling. <br>  <br>  He knows that you will be there, so he wanders back when he is at a loose end or needs comfort. <br>  <br>  Decide what you want & close that door!<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|AA12152120	Hon, don't stress over Marc, you can't change someone who doesnt want to be changed. Let him go, and don't except him back. You deserve much better than what he can offer. As for the job, you are in charge of your life, take the time to apply,and wait a few days, if no one has called you, then go back in to all the places you applied and ask to speak to a manager about your application. Only you will be able to know if you can pay your bills. Everyone struggles in the beginning to get everything right. Don't beat yourself up about the mistakes you will make. Everything will be ok, if you work hard, and stay focused. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|d793c7a580124b83ba4c62c6f6a962baaa	If he really loves you?

Actually leave him now! What a douche bag!

jcL7gDMKaa	I am also a Scorpio female<br>  <br>  Yeah, i would have to be REALLY sure about the guy if i was to marry him. i also love kids and think I would make a good mother. I would be firm but fair. I do like my independence and also find it hard to trust people completely as a result of this. Am so used to trusting only my own judgement. <br>  <br>  Am not sure about the seperate rooms thing tho haha|`|QhlEOI6iaa	I don't think its a Scorpio thing, because I am a Scorpio female as well, with my Sun, Saturn, Pluto and Rising in Scorpio, my moon is in Leo (also very dominant and strong sign) and more then anything I want to get married and have a family. Just like you I was raised by a single parent, and I saw how difficult it is for one person to raise a child, I would not want to go through the same thing alone. I need stability and I need to know that the person I am with is a marriage material, otherwise I will not stay with them for too long.<br>  <br>  I guess I'm different from you, because the thought that I might not find a man to marry scares the **** out of me|`|xEWVqdwnaa	Well unless im totally devoted and love a guy a lot then im fine with sharing some of my privacy. We value privacy a whole lot|`|HuXMiJLpaa	^^^above is wrong. I'm a scorpio sun with a pisces moon virgo rising, no fire or air in my chart, and the idea of having kids and getting married is some far off concept I don't understand. The thought of spending my life with one person seems so boring, but it may honestly be that I'm afraid. It maybe that no man has been able to hold my interest for very long. <br>  <br>  Moving on, I feel the same way you feel. Honestly what I've noticed from my personal experience that a lot of scorpio women marry more than once or they have a child or two but have never gotten marry. My observation.|`|e4h5yVXgaa	You need to get involved w an air or fire moon and venus combo... and I would say that you need to not give marriage much thought and get out there and live your life wildly! Therefore you can meet many guys and the more adventures you have the more fulfilled and ready you'll be when mister right waltz into your life. What you need is a kindred-soul; a soulmate!! I would also say that you shouldn't give much thought to things in life that imo, turn out perfectly if they are left to happen naturally. I think free-spirits like us need to understand that we are not planners. Listen to me! "like us" I dont even know you. I just read your post and thought I'd contribute some feedback. It's worth a shot! I just thought maybe you could relate to me, bc I definitely can relate to you:)

mQPTqzeAaa	I'm not a man; but I am an Aquarian. Hang in there, though, because people born under this sign are very unpredictable. My best guess is that he still likes you; but the sad truth is Aquarians usually put their buddies first in a relationship & likes space. Try being all cool about it & if things work out; great. But if not; just realize that things must have been not meant to be. Maybe Fate doesn't want you guys together at the moment or maybe Fate wants you to find a totally hot, better guy! Good luck & make the best of it.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	My bf is an AQUA man. When he is in love, he will give you everything. Serves you night and day...Will spend for you, buy you nice and expensive things, spoil you, be your slave, be extremely jealous you can't breathe....he will drown you. But watch out, there is always something in return. They don't give for free. I think I attract Aquarius because I have some other Aquarius admirers who do the same thing. They don't care if you have a bf, they are willing to steal you from them. My BF did the same, he stole me from my ex-bf who was a Virgo. If Aquarius is interested, they will be your slave. That's what I know.<br>  <br>  But once they lose their interest, it will be the total opposite. They can insult you and they won't care. They can easily move on. I had to cry and beg for my arrogant aqua bf!!!!! urggghhhhhh|`|wwdllMzYaa	dont get emotional with him about it<br>  dont put him on the spot<br>  just casually mention you wana meet up again, and leave it with him<br>  give him a call, for a chat, and just say hey wann ameet next tues or something<br>  <br>  guys in general are a little 'hard' emotion wise, so him not inviting tyou to his bday is rather typical of a guy, never mind an aquarius guy<br>  he probaly didnt think about it|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Its been my experience with Aquarius men to just let them run their course. Don't chase after them or keep on calling or emailing or texting them. Just let it go and then out of the blue they call. Or you run into them and they are so freakin' happy to see you its insane! So I would just let it go. You called he doesn't call you back, there is no need to keep calling him. If he has time for his friends, there is the chance that he's not as into you as you are in him.

L1qQBNbbaa	Before i opened your question i thought Ted Knight was the best followed by Rodney Dangerfield and then bill Murray and Chevy Chase....anyone who hasn't seen this film is missing out on a comedic work of art.<br>  <br>  <br>  Judge Smails: I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn't want to do it. I felt I owed it to them.|`|GfG6wupTaa	Absolutely, positively, without a doubt the GOPHER!!!!! The end was the best (give me the 10)!!!!!!!|`|7365b5fc6686784fac36d66f144f7b79aa	The Gopher!!!!|`|ba52jQHyaa	To hard to say, it's a great ensemble cast.  if I must pick one I'll have to go with Bill Murry|`|AA10716061	Ted Knight, I thought he made the movie alot funnier, I didn't think the movie was that great but the actors did a great job with their roles and made the movie funny
vVka4ZA0aa	Since I actually read the comics, I'm going to say The Joker because he's so much more intelligent than people think he is. And he's an absolute sadist. He can also move quicker and manuever a lot better than the Penguin. He's very tricky and his plans are usually very in depth and immaculate that it can often take Bruce Wayne a long time to figure them out. The Penguin is nothing more than a crime boss now because he's not good enough or interesting enough to be anything more than just a B-Lister on Batman's villians list.|`|0nUzzm0naa	The Penguin, actually, because it has a layer of protective fat. But then, the Joker has a layer of protective grease, coming from his hair. But the penguin would still win due to the unlikely conjunction of Mars and Venus.|`|fcMKOpAbaa	the joker, he can move around easier.<br>  i know that the penguin has his umbrella and his other toys but you cant beat a good old fashioned pair of legs|`|pfVSIzC1aa	the joker! especially if its heath ledger playing him|`|U7wWKMoEaa	definately joker who is the penguin anyway?|`|agiRRK4baa	the joker, cuz he isn't an obese midget with a bird fetish.|`|3cd313633af34b8246ba0b586918ad6daa	joker, cause the penguin is too fat to move around|`|vmmzslTraa	Joker of course|`|rB84SUMPaa	Who cares.<br>  The question is <br>  <br>  have you ever gotten laid? by a real person.|`|ZIMmGqEAaa	The Joker because he is ruthless.|`|wdxUb3moaa	Joker.....he has a more disturbed and evil mind than penguin<br>  **sinister minds always win!**|`|Bdgza4G2aa	I am going to say the Penguin simply because I know for a fact that almost everyone will say the Joker because of "The Dark Knight". I'm sticking up for the little (or...big guy, in this case...) guy.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	the joker<br>  because the penguin annoyed me and was played by like danny devito,<br>  hes just a wierd creepy little fat guy who likes penguins in my opinion|`|AA10731562	joker because hes faster and cooler|`|Vk1FoxsRaa	the joker

The entire album has had an influence on me.|`|zHZOxfbVaa	i heard thunderstruck by acdc and then smells like teen spirit by nirvana and i knew rock was for me|`|NgQQT2J5aa	i will never forget the day i was sitting in my 5th grade classroom and they played Welcome to the Jungle. that opened my eyes|`|SmVHRpr5aa	Yeah dude. When I first heard Pink Floyd's Shine on You Crazy Diamond at 12 years old.|`|x3vhAFMyaa	this is the first rock song i remember hearing ever. and it got me hooked. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WX_4FNoto4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WX_4FNot...</a><br>  <br>  'nuff said|`|oOSNI3wbaa	pour some sugar on me by def leppard<br>  <br>  i saw the world premier of the video on MTV way back in the day. after watching that video, i've never looked back. i've been into metal ever since. and yes to all you young'uns out there, def lep was considered metal back in the day.
RgymoiIQaa	The similarity to Eminem is that he is white, and has a northern accent. Other than that the rap flow and the lyrics are two totally different styles and are not comparable. I think he is cool in his own kind. But, he is not and never will be hip-hop to me. He is pop.|`|mo8YBvC4aa	he's alright but he's most certainly not eminem...i hope his "i love college" doesn't get overplayed but i think its getting very close to that point|`|qXsbRsiXaa	Asher Roth is good but he talks about totally weird stuff, em talked about stuff that a suburban white kid and a inner city black kid could connect with, and i dont see many inner city black kids going to college so he just needs to make more songs that a lot more people can connect with. I love College is a good song. And I don't mean what I say in a racists way. So please don't take it that way and sorry if i offend anyone with my response.|`|FkylAOpAaa	i dont really hear the resemblence to eminem that every one talks about.  I like him as an artist cause he is one of the few rappers that i can relate to.  I think he's in the new wave wit B.o.B. and Charles Hamilton.  They kinda push the boundries of hip hop|`|IesiHHdxaa	can't say i'm a fan. if he comes out with something better than his college song, maybe i'll like him more, but right now, i don't like him. kinda sounds like em, and could be better lyrically. definitely beats soulja boy though!|`|szJSaZspaa	that song he got is iight but he aint no eminem
MOUJeXD4aa	it's not "meiko" is it?<br>  if not, if you can give me a genre it'll be easier to find|`|bOlG6loraa	it's by a group called ABBA. love that song :)|`|A8NzjbQvaa	youtube it then.|`|B3OlFeffaa	Use your search bar!<br>  So many people don't seem to know that you can google the lyrics and possibly find the song.<br>  Just type in the lyrics or the song name and you should get some results

Although you're 13, idk if you'll understand why V does what he does. There isn't much cursing, just mild violence.|`|ba52jQHyaa	I liked the movie and I thought it was OK for my 10 & 13 year old to watch|`|YrrtMS5Taa	Why don't your parents just watch it themselves and then tell you whether you can watch it or not? Considering everyone has different ideas on what it is and is not appropriate it's rather hard to give you an accurate answer.<br>  <br>  It also depends on your maturity. But I'd say... unless your parents agree that you are very mature, hold off until you're 14-15. Good luck with your swim team thing!|`|eTjSnzIxaa	I thought the movie was very well done.  There is violence and blood as befitting a rated R film, however the story is very compelling.  It may actually take a couple of viewings for you to fully appreciate the full concept of the film.  I would let you watch it.

She makes the show, ROCK!|`|AA12145826	My top 2 are Ziva & Kate, simply because they had to play off against Tony & stand up to Gibbs at the same time.|`|nnOVIOV9aa	I like Abby...|`|9ZLoeoxIaa	Gibbs is a dick|`|oFo6obmVaa	i like Abby the best she rocks!!|`|OWXI806qaa	Probably either Abby, Gibbs, Tony, McGee, or Ziva.<br>  Wait a second....I think I just named the entire cast. Oops.<br>  Well I guess I just love NCIS. It has to be one of my <br>  very favorite shows ever! <br>  One of the very reasons I like it, is because all of the<br>  characters are so likable. <br>  <br>  I like Gibbs because he's such a hero in so many ways & he's<br>  so cool. I think that he & Abby's relationship is so funny, <br>  & I love it when he slaps Tony on the head; Or when he<br>  sneeks up behind him.<br>  <br>  I likesneaksbecause he's so funny & he reminds me a lot of my<br>  brother. They're like the same person. It's scary!<br>  <br>  Ziva because.....well what's not to like about Ziva, I mean<br>  she's just plain awesome!<br>  <br>  McGee is obviously kinda dorky, but he's so funny. I love<br>  it when he & Tony pull pranks on each other. Or when Tony<br>  calls him "Elf-Lord".<br>  <br>  But Abby is hilarious! I think the whole idea of a <br>  happy, bubbly Goth is funny anyway, but Abby is awesome.<br>  I'm surprised though that she's not really unhealthy with<br>  all the Kat Pow she drinks. ( I like Ducky & Kate too)<br>  <br>  Well, sorry I couldn't give you just one, but I love all of them so <br>  much. I've been watching NCIS for years & I think it gets<br>  better as it goes along. <br>  <br>  Can't wait for Tuesday!<br>  Happy Watching!|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	Abby, because of how different she is to the show. She is tattos and goth not like being military conforming. She is goth and likes the macabe, she slept in a wedding dress in a coffin. She likes black roses. Yet she craves life and health. It is wierd yin and yang thing. It is seen how she handles when another cast member is hurt or killed. But more how she rejoices when she sees the cast member back at work. She acts rebelish when she asked Gibbs what new tattoo she should get. It is kind of of a wierd boss/father relationship. Where Gibbs is a Semper Fi Marine who is happier conforming to the militarys way.|`|nLdSwOQLaa	Director Shepard--- is dead<br>  Gibbs---- is awsome but not my fav<br>  DiNozzo----- is hott<br>  Kate---- is dead 2 :(<br>  McGee----- is such an amazing actor <br>  Ziva------- willl probably nvr lose a fite<br>  Abby------- *****MY FAV*****<br>  Ducky------- bestest ducky in da world<br>  Palmer------- such a nerd, but adds humor 2 the show<br>  <br>  <br>  abbys my fav cuz she has style, humor, and love how shes like gibbs' fav and it shows. shes such a gifted and talented actress and singr.|`|d32r2HESaa	DiNozzo - Tony. <br>  <br>  I love Tony. I like that he doesn't really get taken down by anything and he always bounces back. It's awesome to see a character who seems to never be serious. I also like him because I love how he tries not to make it obvious when he gets hurt feelings over something stupid - like Gibbs introducing him last in that episode I saw the other day.|`|GmGogzsXaa	DiNozzo- hes so funny and cute<3<br>  Gibbs-hes just Gibbs! love him<3<br>  Abby- she is so sweet and cute<3<br>  Kate-She was nice and pretty and funny then she died =[<br>  McGee- hes a little nerd i love nerds<3<br>  Ducky- hes umm.................<br>  Ziva- dont really like her she is annoying and you can so tell she loves tony<br>  Palmer- ..................=/<br>  Director Shepard- she died awwwwwwwww =[|`|eTuK9t85aa	Definitely Ziva David, cause she is just a badazz!!<br>  I actually like all the main characters, they all are great!!

MVlymbiSaa	The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: It's hard to summarise this anime without giving away major spoilers first off. Trust me, you will NOT waste your time watching this.<br>  <br>  Cardcaptor Sakura: Classic magical girl show. If you ever saw the shudderingly awful dub, this is how it was supposed to be.<br>  <br>  Serial Experiments Lain: Bit of a mindscrew this one, but once you get your head round it, it's good. Hard to watch though.<br>  <br>  Death Note: Not a typical shonen, goes slightly downhill after episode 30.<br>  <br>  Akikan: For one reason, it's so bad it's good.<br>  <br>  Fruits Basket: I've never seen it, but apparently it's a harem anime, which is the same genre as Love Hina.<br>  <br>  Love Hina Again: Sequel to Love Hina, apparently isn't as good. I haven't seen it.<br>  <br>  Princess Tutu: Don't let the name put you off, the finale of the first series is awesome, the awesome trend continues throughout the second series towards a thrilling climax. NOT a generic magical girl show.<br>  <br>  Edit: A lot of people will reccomend Naruto/Bleach/One piece. You may like them... But the animating in all three is poor. The plot in all 3 barely moves forward, or does so at a crawl and some of the fanbase is really irritating. Just a warning :P|`|ffceb0619443e8ccaa3378ec7e91decaaa	well if you liked full metal alc. I'd have to say Code Geass. Its about a time when Japan is at war with the rest of the world and Zero( hidden is face) is the most powerful of a rebel group, even though his not japanese. He never shows his face, because really his a normal high school student. Since your a guy Its got  alot of pretty girls and a deep twisted story line.<br>   <br>   And for love hina I think you'd like Chobits. ITs about this guy who buys a really sweet girl who can't talk at first.<br>  <br>   Or Ah! my goddess- this boy finds and owns a goddess and her sisters( not dirty, really sweet)<br>  <br>  Lastly one that I know every guy likes, the ultimte action anime , you've heard of it, but you've been warned, its got over 300 episodes 5 movies and oavs and still going for a long long time. And worst when you watch it in japanese your hooked.<br>  Yahh you got it! its NARUTO<br>  And one more<br>   <br>   Lastly if you like them girly and funny OUran high school host club.

Bored of his life and society in general, Yagami uses a Death Note dropped by the shinigami (death god) Ryuk in order to purge the world of evil. However, matters start getting out of hand when the Japanese Police Force tries to solve the case of the mysterious criminal deaths, and the fact that they are working with master detective L proves a real challenge to Light.<br>  <br>  L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as "Kira" (derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "Killer"), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological cat and mouse between the two begins.<br>  <br>  SouLeater-Set in the Shinigami technical school for weapon meisters, the series revolves around 3 groups of each a weapon meister and a human weapon. Trying to make the latter a "Death Scythe" and thus fit for use by the Shinigami, they must collect the souls of 99 evil humans and 1 witch.<br>  Soul Eater is an anime that centers around meisters and their weapons and their mission to collect 99 evil souls and 1 witch soul. Upon doing that the meister's weapons will become a Deathscythe, which is the highest title for a weapon. Maka, Soul Eater, Black Star, Tsubaki, Death the Kid, and Patty and Liz Thompson are the characters Soul Eater revolves around.

1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Well, there are really lots of things you can find on the net. I am just going to tell you some based on my own observation as a cancer. <br>  <br>  well, i am not really a typical cancer 'cause most signs in my chart are fire signs (aries, sag etc). I'm not like other cancers who can't wait to get married, have billions of babies, and plant trees in their backyards. I am a very adventurous rebel. But still, at the end of the day, I am a cancer. lol<br>  <br>  The sensitive, emotional, shy, nice, moody, honest, loyal things are all true. Even the family, security and selfish thing. The influence on the moon is very strong. It happens to me every month and the people I'm with complain 'cause I turn evil (like a werewolf)when it's full moon. Then I go back to being a saint---a very nice girl when the moon is gone. I'm starting to really really believe all these horoscope thing. It makes sense especially compatibility. Cancers are very much compatible with Scorpio, Leo, Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. They say Pisces (but i don't like Pisces so that's the only thing I don't believe. lol). <br>  <br>  Cancers are very idealistic (to the point of being quixotic), romantic, ridiculous and dreamy.  As a cancer, I am a perfectionist. I hate dirty jobs (i mean cheating and slacking off). Cancers can be very funny and will always be little kids no matter what. Will always be the baby--that's why other signs find cancers annoying. cancers care what other people think and would be best around a confident and gentle Scorpio. CANCERS LIKE to care about people but are too scared to be rejected. So we build a really thick wall around us. We are very private loners. We are selfish because we don't want to be hurt 'cause it's going to really crush us. It really hurts when you care and love and others don't. That's terrible. <br>  <br>  We really want to help and just be nice. The greatest feeling in the world is kindness--that works for me. Cancers i know are naturally kind and people think we are not being ourselves. It is US, to be honest. We are just misunderstood. We are way more sensitive than described...A lot of people always ask me  "are you really that nice? Just be yourself!" I always get that every time, believe me.|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	Moody, Crabby, appear to be bitchy, and overreact. They're just sensitive. Somewhat sarcastic, practical, somewhat uncaring and selfish.

pTERJdzQaa	LMAO ^_^<br>  <br>  No, pokemon don't eat each other, they battle each other, they also interact with each other and their trainers, Just like the animals in our world, In the world of Pokemon, the Pokemon are basically like our pets, and they live side by side with pokemon trainers, breeders, researchers etc.<br>  <br>  In the video games: The Pokemon that you catch are the ones that you engage in battle with and gain experience to level up.<br>  <br>  Technically they do eat each other as a instinct for survival[what the pokedex says|`|YCUJMvWQaa	oh sanps i would always wonder the same thing <br>  i think they dom eat each other cause remember when the pokedex talks and says "weedle a former poison bug pokemon, pidgeys prey on these hairry worms"<br>  so im guesing theydo eat them, =O<br>  hope i helped =]=]|`|Cj2uorAeaa	that would be kinda cool...|`|XQMm3Ahraa	yes they eat pokemon primarily magikarp and miltank<br>  <br>  they only eat the pokemon that are like actual animals so they don't eat chicken<br>  <br>  or they have a portal to the real orld where they get access to real animals to eat those<br>  <br>  but yeah seeing as they have real fruit they must also havfe real animals|`|MTr4dy3naa	I think they have eaten Magikarps before and on the episode "Pokemon Shipwreck" Jesse, James and Meowth waned to eat one, Meowth bit it and got his teeth broken and Misty said that they were all scales and bones.|`|NQKSDjz7aa	Oh my gosh, I always wondered the same thing!<br>  Imagine eating a Mr. Mime.

8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	I never read the book. I thought the movie was great though. I watched it in 3D and... you almost don't notice. It's done in stop-motion animation, so it was filmed with 3-dimensional characters to begin with. And watching it in 3D sort of brings that out. It wasn't corny, it just made the world seem that much more real and immediate. If that makes sense. There were a couple of "gimmicks" like bats flying at your head, but most of the time it was really understated and subtle. It just added an extra layer, I think.

Finally, in frustration, he blurts out, "Why won't you talk to me??" So she turns to him and says sweetly, "What would you like to talk about?" Smiling sarcastically, he replies, "How about nuclear physics?"<br>  <br>  "Let's start with a simple question," the blond replies. "Why is it that rabbits poop small pellets, dogs poop long logs, and cows poop flat patties?" The man, confused, thinks on it a moment before admitting that he doesn't know the answer.<br>  <br>  The blond smiles and says, "Then how do you expect to discuss nuclear physics when you don't know crap?"<br>  -----<br>  John was a clerk in a small drugstore but he was not much of a salesman. He could never find the item the customer wanted.<br>  <br>  Bob, the owner, had about enough and warned John that the next sale he missed would be his last.<br>  <br>  Just then a man came in coughing and he asked John for their best cough syrup. Try as he might John could not find the cough syrup. Remembering Bob's warning he sold the man a box of Ex-Lax and told him to take it all at once. The customer did as John said and then walked outside and leaned against a lamp post.<br>  <br>  Bob had seen the whole thing and came over to ask John what had transpired.<br>  <br>  "He wanted something for his cough but I couldn't find the cough syrup. I substituted Ex-Lax and told him to take it all at once," John explained.<br>  <br>  "Ex-Lax won't cure a cough" Bob shouted angrily.<br>  <br>  "Sure it will" John said, pointing at the man leaning on the lamp post. "Look at him. He's afraid to cough."<br>  ---------<br>  "A woman gets on a bus with her baby. The bus driver says: "That's the ugliest baby that I've ever seen. Ugh!"

The man says: "You go right up there and tell him off – go ahead, I'll hold your monkey for you."<br>  --------------<br>  Logic Lesson: <br>  A fourth-grade teacher was giving her pupils a lesson in logic. <br>  <br>  "Here is the situation," she said. "A man is standing up in a boat in the middle of a river, fishing. He loses his balance, falls in, and begins splashing and yelling for help. His wife hears the commotion, knows he can't swim, and runs down to the bank. Why do you think she ran to the bank?" <br>  <br>  A girl raised her hand and asked, "To draw out all his savings?"<br>  ---------------<br>  One day there are some kids in a psychology class. The<br>  teacher stands up and says to the class, "Stand up if you <br>  think you are stupid!"

To which Little Johnny replies, "No miss, I just hate to<br>  see you standing there all by yourself!!"<br>  --------<br>  About a century or two ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave the Vatican. Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community.<br>  <br>  So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If<br>  the Jew won, they could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave.<br>  <br>  The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle aged man named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The pope agreed.<br>  <br>  The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, "I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay."<br>  <br>  An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. <br>  The Pope said, "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around<br>  me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?"<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. "What happened?" they asked.<br>  <br>  "Well," said Moishe, "First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here." <br>  <br>  "And then?" asked a woman.<br>  <br>  "I don't know," said Moishe. "He took out his lunch and I took out mine."<br>  ----------<br>  Boy: Will you punish me for something I didn't do? <br>  <br>  Teacher: Of course not! <br>  <br>  Boy: Good, because I|`|2kg2cOHOaa	I'm sooooo sorry for your friend's mom.

9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	What a good show this is right? I love it! <br>  <br>  Anyways, I always have thought that the dad was one of those dad only by genetics. He didn't care or want to be a father or he would have been in their lives from the beginning. However, as he got older he probably got nostalgic about his kids and checked up to see what happened to them and just from memory decided to leave Dexter his house. OR, Brian could have gone to his father's house and said 'write out your will and leave it to Dexter right now or I'll kill you' and then he killed him anyways.<br>  <br>  Even when Dexter remembers his youth he does not ever remember his birth father.<br>  <br>  Edit: okay, he remembers him that one time but other than that, he has many more memories of his birth mother than father. I still think that his birth father was his father mainly by only 'genetics'.

Either way, it's better than everyone saying they think your ugly|`|hRNpGnktaa	Young men have stamina.

My personal rule is over eightteen and under 40. again, nothing against 40 year olds, but I think 12 years is a little much.  8 isn't.<br>  <br>  BUT...if you are uncomfortable, politely refuse.  You can't change what these women see in you.  you just have to live with it.|`|1vV9K4QXaa	Probably because they are already settled down and like the idea of younger men finding them attractive. It makes them feel younger.|`|qlpjDvoNaa	Dude they probably think ur older, I'd probably take that as a compliment that I didn't look like an immature teenager|`|PIxBwUNoaa	You should learn to appreciate older women|`|ac3HAiOKaa	Because men hit their sexual peak between 18-22 where women hit theirs between 28-32... so i'd be a good match.|`|KrEmq5Staa	lol its either where ur from you look older than ur age or those women are perverted|`|D9NgLfTQaa	lol.|`|OtgxpYFmaa	lmao|`|ZHu1tPKqaa	lol!|`|oRM0je0iaa	that just wierd|`|zih6UH0laa	eww<br>  they must think you're around their age<br>  or they might like younger men|`|EfpnRLyUaa	maybe you look older, haha, or they are insecure

6SXIsCI1aa	Well, it depends on what you are in to, but www.girlslife.com is a cool place.  (you know, GL the magazine).  And i guess A girls world.com<br>  These are just some suggestions.  just type in whatever type of website you are looking for into a search engine and it would come  up with several suggestions.|`|4cDrapNQaa	I'd suggest GURL.com. It is filled with facts of the human body and it has a lot of various subjects that are addressed as well. I would also like to add the awareness that it contains a good amount of sex facts and questions related to the topic, but it is very informative, in my opinion. I used to go on it when I was younger, to read and learn tons of new things. :) I'd say, def. check it out and see if it's for you or not. :)<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!

Hallmark is supposed to be family friendly isn't it?  I am not sure but if the girl is mature it should be fine it can't be nearly as bad as stuff on mtv like the raunchy music videos.

y96nDmEXaa	Depends how big the venue is. Most likely you'll need a PA system, microphones, leads and a DI (Direct Imput) Box. If it's a small room, you could probably get away with Microphones, leads and a small vocal amp.<br>  <br>  Either way, it could be an expensive gig if the venue doesnt have any of this.

jwrcHFglaa	I had a teacher in college that could do it and explained it to us using a glass of water.  He would hold the water in his mouth, puff his cheeks some.  Then he could push the water out of his mouth in a steady stream while taking a breath.  When he needed another breath he would fill his cheeks again, take a breath and so on and so on.  Frank Sinatra was supposed to be a master of this for singing, which a whole new world of huh?|`|gVVZQ4ikaa	My brother plays sax, and he have learned it with a blade of straw. He took it in a glass of water and blow into it, so the water made bubbles. In the same time he was catching breath through his nose. It takes hin 5 days to learn, but finally he's got it. ---- The greater the horn the harder to learn circular breathing. Nearly impossible to do it on a tuba. Relatively easy to learn on flute or oboe (english horn) --- Definitely you can't do circular breathing whilst singing. That's impossible. The whole thing works with breath, not with voice. Sorry to say.|`|g4QFDU6paa	www.breathing.com/articles/circular-brea...
QHaIKYUraa	I heard about that tour on the radio today,<br>  <br>  I go to concerts frequently and you are looking for General Admission (standing room) tickets- Usually they are around 30-40 dollars plus convenience fee for each ticket- this varies for the bands. The total usually adds up to around 50 or 60 dollars for one person. It usually depends on the venue-you want to get them as soon as possible from ticket master/ live nation.

GnYw9Pvwaa	The people who made it did drugs and liked drugs. Drugs inspired them to do what they did. It's pretty straight foward. Had they not been on drugs there would not have been the references.<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  The Mad Hatter is not a drug reference f.y.i. Hatters went mad in the days of yore because they treated the felt in hats with mercury, which lead to insanity.<br>  <br>  And it was mercury, yes, not lead. I did a study on the subject. Furthermore hatters had no particular contact with lead over anyone else. They didn't rub hats with blocks of metal @@. Mercury is liquid at room temperature, and also was used in the 1500s to extract silver from ore. :D|`|HoHHpwDlaa	i know this doesn't answer your question...<br>  <br>  but a hookah is NOT used for drugs or any kind of illegal substances. It's used for tobacco. <br>  <br>  ...other than that, i happen to like alice in wonderland. and i had no idea that The White Rabbit was another name for cocaine. lol. there's a place down here called The White Rabbit and there's tons of shows there. <br>  <br>  so yeah. hookah stigma - BE GONE!!|`|8q5SeYueaa	The person who wrote the book has used drugs, and it most likely inspired the story, but it's not actually about drugs, so it's claimed. Hookas are used for tobacco. The Mad Hatter drank too much coffee, also, he's crazy because of mercury poisoning. The slang term for coke most likely is a reference to the book, not the other way around.|`|3cd313633af34b8246ba0b586918ad6daa	never thought of it that way. <br>  <br>  but the mad hatter was based on truth, because back then, the people who made hats inhaled a type of chemical coming from the hat which made them crazy.<br>  <br>  mushrooms?|`|F60JZOU3aa	have alisten to this.<br>  <a href="http://beemp3.com/download.php?file=3572297&song=White+Rabbit" rel="nofollow">http://beemp3.com/download.php?file=3572...</a>|`|wIZNsqG1aa	When the book was written cocaine was legal and they didn't start calling it white anything until the 70's so it's nothing more than a coincidence.

hs9Mibf5aa	Oh heck, no.<br>  <br>  Do you ever look closely at the characters on Lost?  None of them (and I don't say this maliciously because I ?

However I agree Coach would vote him off because I see them clashing.|`|El4XqmVZaa	I think Ben (the character) would kill everyone off on the island (on survivor) and I am pretty sure the show's producers would not appreciate that very much.

Each time I think of an anime without romance I remember it has a little bit of romance.   <br>  I would say that Witch Hunter Robin has almost no romance.  The title character is a fifteen-year-old nun who hunts witches and probably doesn't do anything more than notice handsome men or boys.  <br>  Neon Genesis Evangelion has a little romance among the adult characters but the three main characters are fourteen-year-olds who use giant robots to fight aliens and are too neurotic (or even insane) to notice their subconscious attractions to one another.<br>  Gunslinger Girl features prepubescent cyborg girls who kill terrorists for the Italian government.  Most of the girls are at least a little bit attracted to their adult male handlers and suffer if their affection is not returned,  but there is no serious romance,  just the girls trying to be girls while brutally slaughtering terrorists (and witnesses) and being treated like valuable but expendable property by their superiors at the agency.<br>  Dot hack sign is mostly about exploring the mystery of the computer game called the World.  Two of the players were once married, and two who meet in the game become attracted to each other and meet in the real world at the end, but it is not a romance story.<br>  The title character in the Shaman King is a great fighter but some what henpecked by his domineering, approximately fourteen-year-old fiancee but there is no romance, just a light of  competing to become Shaman King and lot of converting enemies into friends.<br>  I;m sure is is a lot of great anime with a little romance but mainly about fighting, saving the world, solving mysteries, etc. etc.|`|amcqJkWhaa	Juuni Kokki a.k.a The Twelve Kingdoms. It's a beautiful story, and a fantastical world, and it feels complete even without a romance factor. Well it does have some parts, but they're more like implications than anything, and not very dramatic. But, what's there is believable, so... if I were to have just gotten out of a relationship, but saw the friendship that comes about between Rakushun and Yoko... I would think it was a very good thing, because as it seems genuine and stuff, you could hope that it can blossom further, but for this anime, it gets cut off, so you don't have to worry about it. : D|`|bZsF1n0zaa	I think Naruto is boring now.<br>  <br>  Bleach also is getting Boring.<br>  <br>  <br>  One Piece is far from a "kiddy pirate show". Are you sure you watched  it?...It's dealt with themes that may be too much for kids so I'm pretty sure it isn't kiddy. Such as Wars, False Gods, Deaths, Human slavery and bargaining, plus the bloody awesome fights and much more. I'm talking about the Original Japanese one. If you'ves seen the 4kids dub...now that's why you would think it's kiddy. They made a teen show into a little 5 year old show...it was horrible...just horrible. I hate 4kids!<br>  I have to admit that at first it seems a bit "kiddy" but that's just to introduce things, get people to see the characters develop. It get's serious at the Kuro arc or Baratie Arc. And One Piece doesn't have any romance either. <br>  <br>  Naruto and Bleach aren't "kiddy" either, but I don't like them anymore, I used to...but they both just don't seem to get better after after a long while.<br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|Bdgza4G2aa	Try AzuManga Daioh. It has no romance, and will be sure to cheer you up about your aforementioned situation. Regardless, it is one of the most hilarious anime that I have ever watched. You can expect that, though, because it was created by Kiyohiko Azuma.|`|UsxoEEhdaa	If you're judging One Piece by the dub, you should definitely give it another go on the Japanese version, where there's an actual storyline. Besides that, I also suggest Fairy Tail, Death Note, and Soul Eater.|`|elLDrkNiaa	Deathnote<br>  <br>  Avatar: The Last Airbender<br>  <br>  Trigun (badass)|`|Z0izseL8aa	Death note. not a love story...at all<br>  <br>  nothing else I can think of D:

RgivbKrHaa	I take piano theory too and I found that I had the same problem you have (Everything just kind of sounded the same). My piano teacher however gave me a trick to learn some of the intervals, and now I am doing much better at naming them. You basically play the notes of the interval and associate them with the first few notes of a song. Here are a few example I feel helped me the most...<br>  <br>  Major 2nd: Just sounds one note higher<br>  Minor 3rd Below: Oh say can you see<br>  Perfect 4th: Oh Christmas tree<br>  Perfect 5th: Twinkle twinkle little star<br>  Perfect 6th: My Bonnie<br>  Perfect Octave: Somewhere over the rainbow<br>  <br>  You can use those songs as an example or you could make up your own that would help you remember them even more. <br>  <br>  Good Luck on your midterm!! Hope I was able to help out a bit...

So at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter (to me) if he's gay or not. If he is actually helping people, I think that's great. I'm not pure enough to judge anyone- I have to leave it up to God Almighty. : )|`|oVHFz52Laa	I am sorry but that is not a nice word. We all have some tendencies and it does not make one a homosexual if you do not act on those tendencies.<br>  <br>  I am not interested in Richard Simmons' sexual orientation but like Strawberry said it, he has helped a lot of women and that means a lot in my books.|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	I don't know what you think a fag is.<br>  <br>  I love Richard Simmons.  He had been abused by his father as a child. So? He is searching for the love of a Father. And has bitterness because of this.<br>  So he may think he is homosexual. Many boys who felt unloved or were abused by their dad decide to believe the world in this.<br>  He really went into depression when his mother died. But he really needs our prayers.<br>  The Holy Spirit has moved on me to pray for him. That there are those who mean him serious harm. He really needs Gods protection much & to realize that God is protecting Him. That he can learn to trust the heavenly Father.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fathersloveletter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersloveletter.com</a><br>  <br>  Actually, Sid Roth interviewed Cathy Oats. She wrote the book, 'Open the eyes of my heart Lord. He heals the broken hearted.'.  And her problem was similar to Simmons. People hated the fat girl when she was young. So she hated the fat girl. She became skinny... And was loved. But she rejected that part of her.  She had a broken heart because of this. That carried with her life.<br>  Until Jesus decided to mend her broken heart. Jesus gave her a vision of her fat girl child hood. She hated that girl who looked so sad an rejected. But Jesus stood behind that sad little part of her (who she thought was big & fat). He asked Cathy if she could accept this fat girl. She couldn't. But then Jesus accepted this fat girl. He stood by her & hugged her. Then when she saw this acceptance. She joined with that part of her she had hated & cut off. Jesus mended her broken heart.<br>  Now she wrote this book & has shared her testimony & many have had mended hearts.<br>  This was one part of Jesus Ministry, 'to heal the broken hearted...' <br>  <br>  He's not a fag to me.|`|ZO8tWC6aaa	he's a fag..or maybe it's just an act for fame|`|8pG8Y3rJaa	I bet he at least uses punctuation.|`|sjWsxtVraa	richard simmons rocks. he rocks on.

d793c7a580124b83ba4c62c6f6a962baaa	With Mars in the Eighth House you are likely to exert your energy and initiative into the quest for personal success, self-knowledge and emotional security. Your energy is channelled through powerful, deep-seated but easily aroused emotions and a powerful sex-drive. There is a desire for leadership within your social and business sphere - involvement with metaphysical or occult groups is a possibility. Your deep interest in finance, big business and a keen, positive attitude to investment ensures success. You possess an intuitive sense that is well tuned when it comes to assessing prospective partners and financial opportunities.|`|FE96lTPLaa	Mars in the 8th house does not means short life.

I have a gibson les paul custom... but I played a junker for many years... it did what I wanted it to do... and then I broke it.. badly .Such is life!|`|FUwnW9Mtaa	If the price is the issue, consider the re-sale value.If sound is the real issue,you can replace the capacitor on your tone control with an"Ice Cube.tm" and dial it from clean on into overdrive.

I missed his performance last night, and this one was good but not great tonight, but he has a great vocal talent so he deserves to stay in the competition and be in the top 3 for sure.<br>  <br>  I'm also glad that Allison (?) made it. The girl with the red hair.|`|oLfcE5kXaa	I'm soooo happy!!!!! <br>  I voted for him for an hour straight last night (:<br>  And I agree, he is going to totally win the competition! <br>  Loooooooooooove him!!!! <333|`|bZwABbpNaa	Seriously they should just stop the show and announce him the winner.<br>  He's amazing. <3|`|HjoDyiUnaa	Me!!!! I love him.I voted 15 times for him:)|`|h1WEBpWyaa	Not me! I mean, I would have picked him over the other guy who's in the top 6 this week, but between him and Nick? Cmon. No contest.

Give me something to appreciate about you, American Idol.|`|r5h9YhqGaa	I am right there with you.

Consider renting a popcorn machine and offering a grab bag of movie theater candy concession items, or do it yourself.<br>  <br>  The “theater” is your viewing area, which should have ample ground seating and an electrical outlet nearby. <br>  Research DVD projector rental vendors in your area and ask a lot of questions. If you are not the “technical type” make sure that you set up everything in advance with the help of a tech-savvy friend so there are no mishaps at the party. If you can, you can ask the DVD rental house to draw you a diagram if you are unsure of how to set up the equipment.<br>  Here is a list of items that we usually rent or use for movie parties:<br>  <br>  DVD projector & player <br>  Movie screen (or you can use a white wall or hanging white sheet) <br>  2 speakers for stereo sound <br>  Speaker receiver with cords that hook up to the DVD projector & player <br>  Speaker cords that are long enough to extend from the screen back to the receiver <br>  Extension cords <br>  Table to set equipment on <br>  Duct tape or mats to secure cords so kids don’t trip on them <br>  Or you have a big Screen TV and rent movies, set it all backyard with parent permission. Make sure it's secure and out of the way and safe.<br>  <br>  The Celebrations team chooses these movies as being perfect for a backyard movie party: (or go your way)<br>  <br>  1. Willy Wonka-- <br>  A nostalgic movie that is great for all ages! The songs will have everyone singing along, and you can play out this theme with a candy-clad birthday cake and movie tins full of candy for party favors.<br>  2. Lady & The Tramp Italian Theme-- <br>  Who can forget the iconic spaghetti scene from “Lady & The Tramp”? Luckily, pizza delivery is the #1 kid’s party food and a red-and-white-check motif is classic Italian decor. They’re all easy to prepare for your kid’s party!<br>  3. Super Hero-- <br>  Super Hero movie themes are simple, as there are plenty of decorations specific to Batman, Superman, or Spiderman. Add to the atmosphere with hanging metallic stars from trees.<br>  4. Pirates of the Caribbean or Sea Themes-- <br>  For older kids, a “Pirates of the Caribbean” party is ideal with adventurous food and nautical décor. For a younger crowd, go with a sea-themed movie such as “The Little Mermaid” or “Finding Nemo”.<br>  5. Harry Potter--<br>  “Harry Potter” is a favorite for kids of all ages: who doesn’t love the magical adventures of Harry and the gang? For party favors, give guests a simple magic trick or a collapsible wand with a list of spells. Ask everyone to come as his or her favorite magical character and stop the show with a magician at the movie’s intermission!<br>  6. Go your way any way you want.<br>  <br>  A movie party is really fun and easy to plan. It is like a regular party without having to plan activity’s and entertainment. For the colors you can have red yellow and black.You can red and yellow streamers twisted together and put up around the house. Then you can have red yellow and black balloons put up around the house. For decorations to show that it is a movie party you can get plastic decorations of the movie popcorn and movie reels. For food you can go out and get the food that you will get at the movies before you go in. For entertainment you can have a movie playing.<br>  You can also make it like an actual movie theater and when your guest come through the door you can give them a ticket to a movie. Then after you give them their ticket you can have a table or counter with the food and drinks on it where they go and get their food, as they continue walking to go the movie you can have something like a table or a something that will make a stand and ask for their tickets. After this it will be time for the movie!!<br>  <br>  Turn your backyard into an outdoor cinema and watch movies under the stars.|`|BM9oGl8maa	what kind of cake and how many people? you could have a large bowl sitting next to the pool with fruit kabbobs arranged the way you would arrange, like, flowers. how big is the pool and pond. you're lucky. i usually had parties for my birthday and invited friends, but this year, my 14th birthday really surprised me and i hadn't thought about it too much. i'm trying too save up for a super awesome 16th birthday for 2 years from now.|`|pbPe614Raa	it'd be cool to have a tiki party,and like cool drinks with like tasty fruits in them.a little camp fire around the back of your house to chill,make smores.<br>  have it at night though like start it at 6 or something.make it a dress code to make it official,if its a big party though...like everyone where red,thatd be cool,or like a techno party with strobe lights and blacklights with little christmas lights everywhere...and have tons of like neon lightup bracelets and such...|`|3Ns63etJaa	youre crzy for not wanting no themes ??<br>  summer is perfect for themessuch as ; tropical paradise or luia.<br>  <br>  but maybe it should be like a big pool party.<br>  i mean thats what it sounds like is gonna happen.<br>  make it hugeee<br>  rent some big speakers<br>  maybe get a karoke machine<br>  have balloons everywhereee and i mean everywhereee<br>  <br>  <br>  sleepover:<br>  do like manicures and pedicures<br>  tell secrets<br>  stay up late<br>  watch cheesy love movies<br>  eat junk food<br>  talk boys<br>  <br>  and just have fun !! :)

9RTuRPviaa	Dark Horse is a horse racing term referring to a horse that is unknown and therefore difficult to put odds on.<br>  It can mean someone who was previously unknown but is now under scrutiny.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing they were trying to be clever. Didn't work real well.|`|9hFexadLaa	they're trying to sound like a metal band to get attention of more people probably|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	They were sitting around thinking "how can we get any lamer?",then the drummer says "Hey,how about we name are album Dark Horse".|`|M9g7ZZcMaa	because "we are overrated, conformed, radiowave, awful rock "stars" just doesn't fit on a cd cover as well.|`|riBel7G2aa	chad kroeger has done to many lines of coke... that is why
Y0w2Pk5kaa	"Rent a movie and you have 30 days to start watching it. Hit Play, and you have 24 hours to finish it — or play it as many times as you want. Rentals disappear when they expire, so they won’t take up space on your hard drive."<br>  <br>  So yes, you're right, you have to watch it before 24 hours passes. Its only $3-4 to watch it anyway.

nbuQ8OUsaa	hmm, right now i've put a stop to watching gintama. can't remember which episode i was on, possibly 50 but i will get back to it another time.<br>  <br>  gintama is yes, like a sitcom you could say. often very random and nonsensical but i think it's really fresh. gintoki, shinpachi and kagura try to pay the monthly rent by responding to requests by people. each episode, their characters slightly develop and we're introduced with new ones along the way.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	There isn't a plot to it.<br>  <br>  I collect Gintama and I liked how much comedy there is in the story, but I'm thinking of dropping the series. There's no particular plot whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Every chapter and episode has a tiny plot, but those plots don't add up to anything in particular.|`|3NXTRMjPaa	Well, there are some serious episodes with character development which gives us insight on certain character's past. The majority of Gintama episodes however would be considered fillers, though some characters from the vast majority of filler episodes appear from time to time. Its not a bad anime, lots of it is pretty good, but if your not one to enjoy comedy and prefer action, then maybe you should just watch the certain arcs that Gintama has... Each arc is like 3-4 episodes long, and currently I think there's like 4 of them?

AA11452399	Yes I still do watch, but not with the same enthusiasm I had when Warrick & Grissom were there. I'm trying to get used to the newness and give it a chance to shine, afterall it always had great story lines. Haven't given up yet, but I do admit, I miss Grissom so much...boohoo!<br>  :(|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I have watched it since but it is not the same. You are right, Grissom made the show. I could not believe that they killed off Warrick either. I don't know how long I will contiue to watch it. It has not been that impressive.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I must admit, I've been inconsistent. Watched two of them, but have since lapsed.<br>  I think CSI NY is the best CSI show out of the three now, I've more or less moved from Las Vegas to NY.<br>  Gary Sinise is pretty easy on the eyes.|`|3o805Q2Aaa	agreed i dont watch it anymore.|`|AA10954273	I quit when he hooked up with Sara.

AA11118643	I would disagree with them being bigoted unless they really do not want to hear anything but Eminem. He was a great MC, but not this god that some people set him up to be. I would agree with your second point because most people don't bother to look through all the hip hop artists that they can.|`|84a3f58bab9b254359c6da5c7fb80c7caa	Um, no. It's all unique taste in music. Most people I listen to I don't even know what race they are or what they look like. I like a very select few rap or hip/hop songs and most I don't even know who they're by. Does that make me racist? I'd like to think not. Instead I think it makes me PICKY.  <br>  <br>  Allow people their own unique tastes in music. That's why we have such a variety- so everyone has a little bit of something they enjoy.|`|CbywwVSdaa	Some might be but I don't think all are. I for one like NO hip hop (including Eminem), but that doesn't make me prejudiced. It just means that my tastes of music are different from others. Other people are the same. People who say the only hip hop they like is Eminem aren't neccecarily prejudiced, but I assume a lot are.|`|MSMem5qYaa	I completely agree.....I hope i don't sound "racially prejudiced" but most people who say that are white people who live in the burbs.....They heard a crap song by lil wayne or something & then an Em joint..and thought that Em was the best to ever touch the mic..... well he isnt...not even close for me...|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	People who "don't like blacks or hispanics except whites"|`|uYNJ14hoaa	no...people who say that are definitely not racially prejudiced. i say this b/c im black and i think this. i wouldn't say i don't like any hip-hop music but eminem, but i sometimes say this about rap. eminem is the only rapper i respect b/c he doesn't only rap about women and sex... i hate music like that. i like that he raps about real things, and i think it's really sad when pple judge him b/c of that. i also think it's really stupid when people act like they understand him, or try to idolize and obsess over him... all you need to know about eminem is that he's a musical genius and he raps about things that matter.<br>  the short answer: eminem is the only rapper i RESPECT.|`|t1NmFX3Kaa	No. Eminem has a certain style that appeals to a lot of people who aren't even in too rap. some of my friends hate rap but still like eminem.<br>  <br>  I do not think it has anything to do with race|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	I think there is something to what you are saying. It seems that people who say that are the same ones with the good ole southern cross on their pickup. So................

5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I'm hoping the store had surveillance cameras and Sharon's Odd- A$$ gets busted  !!! As much as I dislike Eden and what trouble she has gotten sweet little Noah into ( realizing they are teens ) she shouldn't get in trouble for this ( she can do it on her own without any help )<br>  <br>   I hate how the writers have made me despise Sharon ( not that I was a huge fan before all this craziness began ) But before I could tolerate her.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Sharon looks too young to have Alzeimer's and she has 'missing time', missing time could mean she's abducted by aliens, but we haven't seen any evidence of that, or she is a Multiple Personality and I don't know if we've seen any evidence of that or not (I know Multiple Personality is no longer the correct term, but I don't remember the real one. Maybe one of my other personalities does, but I don't)<br>  <br>  As for Eden, I don't know if Sharon did it on purpose, she could not have known her mother was in the hospital, I don't think and that she would have to leave. Nut she does seem very anxious to get Eden out of the picture but I don't know if she set her up. But it just seems like Noah and Eden are going to have a lot of problems staying together. I don't know how old they are supposed to be, but I would not be surprised to see them elope to get around their parents/brothers.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I agree with you.<br>  Despite Michael and Lauren's advice, Gloria still wants Jeffrey.

Gloria gets into a catfight w/ Jill over Jeffrey then realizes he isn't worth it and walks out leaving Jill who stays w/ Jeffrey <br>  Karen finally confronts Neil over his kiss w/ Tyra, she tells him if he wants to be w/ her [Karen] then he needs to get his act together or their marraige is over! <br>  Cane tells Lily he plans to divorce Chloe and have joint custody of Delia, he wants Lily to raise Delia w/ him and proposes to her while Billy does the same w/ Chloe, he tells her he wants to be a part of Delia's life and asks that Chloe marry him! <br>  Katherine gets Annie on her side, together they try to escape but it's too late. Roger arrives w/ Esther behind him (she followed him there). Esther slaps Roger pissed to know he's been holding Mrs. C hostage, and even more shocked when Clint walks in saying no one is going no where! <br>  <br>  Next - Katherine is held hostage again; Kevin's w/ Amber and Murphy he reads back the note supposedly left by Katherine and notices the beginning letters of the sentences spell Clint!; Ashley threatens Victor saying she'll take herself and her daughter and leave, that Victor will lose them|`|4kuWOZowaa	I know I dont really like her either but I dont want to see her go down for sharon. urghhhh|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Hopefully she won't, but with crazy Sharon.

i7urUh9Yaa	LMAO!  My neighbor wears them all the time.  He does not work at a hospital, he just has them from times he was in the hospital.  That's what I'm thinking, wtf is this guy wearing scrubs for?!  Is he trying to impress someone, thinking he's a doctor or something?  I don't get it.  I work at a hospital and can steal them for free, actually, I have some from Halloween one year, but I would never wear them except for costume or work purposes!|`|qWwybF4Daa	i really dont mind if they wear them and dont work in a medical facility. but personally i love them im a medical receptionist. oh and you dont just have to be in the medical field. my mothers is a cook and thats the dress code for her.|`|c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	I have to admit they are comfy (I wore them when I worked for a Vet..had to...regular clothes would get ruined)...<br>  However...I think seeing someone you KNOW is like an office manager in Wal-Mart wearing scrubs is ridiculous...<br>  BUT....there are soooooo many more fashion faux paux's that it's low on the list (fat guys with t-shirts on that say "Sexy" and it doesn't even cover their beer-gut...now THAT one is a topper!!! LOL)|`|r3o10XbAaa	That is kind of weird.  But i kind of understand, like if a doctor didn't have time to change clothes or something... i dunno... i don't hat them, but its kind of weird.|`|1wDkKyLCaa	i had to wear them for school and then i would just leave them on all day even if i had to go to a store|`|rJu4X6MDaa	well I think you shouldn't try to make yourself look important by wearing scrubs|`|vD7EnfEbaa	no they are comfortable|`|06d3195df0f0d6445a6388f30a77e76caa	In the words of TLC "NO SCRUBS"|`|5H5udjXhaa	who cares|`|wUxnDLCvaa	No|`|HbJ6C83saa	yea i dont get y people do|`|oQ5oKILHaa	No. It would be silly. Maybe a dr didn't have time to change.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	i dont care i just thought u were talking about the show lol|`|xbISxnmfaa	Yes lol.|`|PpWosZsIaa	No, they are most comfortable|`|u3FqxhY8aa	When I read this question I thought you were talking about the show in which case I would have had to kill you (just joking).  Ummm it doesn't bother me that much personally, but I guess in a way that someone who works in a hospital could be bothered since scrubs are associated with hospitals and doctors and nurses would really only know how it feels to be in there all of the time.  And just checking for the show, do they bring back more episodes on like March 17 before lost??|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I'm an RN, so I get to wear them.  They are a lot more comfortable that the starched white things we used to have to wear.  Well, then all the ancillary departments took it upon themselves to start wearing scrubs so now you can't tell a nurse from the cleaning lady.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	lol no i hate the show|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Oh I almost snapped on you man lol.|`|547Ln6rNaa	I thought you were going to dis the show too, that's why I rushed here, lol<br>  <br>  I have worn them out once but I had a good excuse - Our local hospital had a float in the summer parade to raise money for the hospital but the day before they had some major emergency and couldn't spare the staff to ride on it and collect money, so my friend who is an OR nurse (ODP) asked her friends to stand in - since we would be wearing scrubs and masks, no one would know we weren't hospital employees. We got to keep them and used them as PJ's afterwards.|`|fce6b20339c75fb9fb439e1ea485621aaa	No I don't,they're very comfortable. :)|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	No, like someone else said, they are very comfortable and they last forever.....|`|b0iUaUJXaa	Yes I do.Same thing when I see people with their stethoscope around their neck at the store.Not necessary!|`|qKkTI0jnaa	No, I love the show!!! :) :) :)|`|4EflpUK8aa	I used to have to wear scrubs when I worked in day care. They're comfy|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Yeah, I hate it when they do that.<br>  <br>  "Rowdy, no!"|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Doesn't bother me. ?
1wNsBNmxaa	Second album<br>  <br>  Sparks has not commented much on her second album. The as-of-yet untitled album started production in 2008 and is expected to be released in the 2nd quarter of 2009. Sparks' second album is expected to have a higher profile and better production than her first due to the great success of the album itself and its four singles Sparks said she plans on working with Jesse McCartney and Leona Lewis on her new album in a interview on the radio show "Johnjay & Rich" the morning after her appearance at the 2008 American Music Awards. She said the album will be more R&B and dance influenced, and will sound more Beyoncé meets Rihanna. On a update on her MySpace Sparks stated she was "in the studio and writing amazing songs!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|36a85ddfd9e24dd42790fd3d548dd358aa	ash's answer is totally right except fearless was a rumor and it will not be on jordins album.|`|3hOGrHqaaa	Her new album drops in September. The lead single is coming out in either May, June, or July. She premiered some new songs on Johnjay and Rich the other day. She premiered "Let It Rain", "Faith", "Walking On Snow", and "Papercut." Only "Let It Rain" and "Walking on Snow" were good though. Another song called "Fearless" leaked too, and the album is probably gonna be called Fearless. The lead single is rumored as either "Walking on Snow", "Let It Rain", or "Fearless." "Walking on Snow" should so be changed in the lyrics and the song itself to "Walking on Air." Snow is just weird. They are Beyonce and Rihanna influenced, and much better than her first album, and her music sounds like Pop/Dance/Rock and a little R&B. "Faith" and "Papercut" both kinda suck though cuz they sound like "See My Side" (horrible.)

bZsF1n0zaa	My favorite Manga is One Piece! The storyline is a work of art.<br>  <br>  It's about Pirates, but with so many things added to it. <br>  <br>  The Storyline is awesome! It's about wanting to achieve your dreams until the very end and having friends with you at all times. With all the unexpected and amazing plot twists the author, eiichiro Oda, puts in this manga is what I love a lot. Oda is a genious. He is so original in his work and has a one-of-a-kind unique genoius brain.<br>  <br>  It's my favorite manga/anime ever! The best I've read/watched ever.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|4qVWj3UHaa	FuLLmetaL ALchemist is the best anime in my opinion.|`|RThxTnHZaa	Its hard to choose a favorite but I love the action love story animes with comedy to like Inuyasha, DN Angel etc.  but I also like Special A, Lovely Complex, Bokura ga ita, Lovely Complex, Itazura na kiss etc. Which are just regular high school love stories. those are the kind of things i like but I do still luv FMA, Death Note and all of that.|`|UsxoEEhdaa	One Piece is the best manga in my opinion. The anime is a bit too dragged out, but is still good (except the 4kids dub, never watch the 4kids dub). It definitely has the best storyline I've seen out of all the manga I've read, and is the funniest one as well.<br>  <br>  The basic story is pretty simple. Gol D. Roger hides his treasure, called One Piece, on the Grand Line, the most dangerous part of the world, and everyone is out to find it, including the main protagonist, Luffy. So he goes on all sorts of adventures, traveling from island to island, gathering a crew, and getting closer to One Piece. Of course, the storyline is divided into arcs,which all have far more complex and interesting plots, and are some of the best storylines I've seen in any manga. It's full of unexpected plot twists as well, so it's always interesting to read, and you never know what'll happen next.|`|lkED2xROaa	ok, so back when i was obsessed with manga or anime or whatever, i LOVED fruits basket. its about a girl that ends up with a family, and almost everyone in the family can turn into a zodiac animal.|`|87e8b7041fa9789c569f6bd680e49299aa	i actually have to loveless and fruits basket...=P    <br>  thanks for the fun!!!  ^-^<br>  <br>  ~taylor~|`|iB81w0Y2aa	My fav anime/manga series is ouran high school host club                   cuz its so funny and kinda random                                                     its about a girl named haruhi fujioka who's a "commoner" that gos to a rich kids school and comes across the host club where they think shes a guy then she somehow breaks a VERY expensive vase and has to become a host to pay off her dept|`|MVlymbiSaa	The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is my favourite storyline. Although that's probably because I've read all the light novels too. Book 4 completely overshadows everything adapted in the anime. I can't wait until book 4 is made into an anime.<br>  <br>  If it ever is...|`|o2sOX7azaa	My favorite anime is Code Geass- has lots of shocking twists and turns.<br>  My favorite manga would have to be Doubt- it has lots of unbelievable twists.

Mostly its boys who rub up on something, not a female full climax. But it makes you wonder if they have had the chance to experience human to human love and had sexual intercourse would their situation be the same? I think its hard to say. Are these people  able to physically climax with these objects or is is based on a comforting level that the object represents? <br>  <br>  But yes, its very odd. thanks for sharing.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Never heard about it, cool, I guess you learn something new all the time.

9teAbDMJaa	Harry Potter by a long shot. The books and movies are far better written, the characters more developed, and the story line is deeper. <br>  Harry Potter shows characters experiencing real emotions, while Twilight puts romance on such a pedestal that it overshadows any real feelings the characters should be having, but for some reason, aren't. <br>  Harry Potter has good values, showing the eventual win of good in god vs. evil. Twilight romanticizes mental and emotional abuse. <br>  <br>  J.K. Rowling created an entirely new world, Stephenie Meyer just put badly designed vampires in the one that already existed.|`|sP8KrvA7aa	Harry Potter hands down.|`|AM33tqYAaa	Harry potter would make the Twilight guy his *****|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	dammit it's like nobody uses the search bar. as a majority, yahoo uses prefer harry potter to twilight (and i do too). for these reasons: poor script, poor effects (due to low budget) and poor acting (for me the cast were there to look pretty and not to tell a story)|`|TGWETA8caa	No contest, sorry people are even assoiciating them.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter is the best!|`|lZVz8SwBaa	HARRY POTTER|`|goe3y4FPaa	harry|`|Qtqnk7P2aa	the twilight books are more addicting, but the movie sucked, so harry potter for the  movie.|`|5nxlLfhNaa	harry potter...<br>  but transformers is good too!!!..<br>  :)|`|hFojLOq4aa	Harry Potter Books and Movies. twilight is not bad, but it doesn't deserve to be in a category with harry potter.|`|Dy4JAL9Qaa	hmmm...

Harry Potter also provides readers with humor along with excitement. The imagery is beautiful and the series has a larger world-wide following. Twilight appeals to a certain group of people and isn't written all that well. <br>  Both series are enjoyable and interesting, but I prefer Harry Potter over Twilight any day.|`|biPo9bhZaa	I definently choose twilight all the way. THe books are the best and vampires are awesome!! Also the books are way better.|`|pHWYYJZDaa	Twilight! The movie is not as good as the book but it is good.

aihogb26aa	I think there's a very good chance that Matt Giraud and Megan will be asked back to the wild card show. Both had large fan bases from the earlier rounds.|`|g5RS83paaa	the judges said a couple of them tonite will be asked back to sing another song for the wildcard, I think she has a good shot|`|dHcP602caa	I was glad Allison (the redhead) and Adam (the guy who got voted in last) got through, but I didn't think Kris deserved a spot at all. I kind of wanted Mishavonna (Drops of Jupiter) to get through, but only because she sang that song. I don't know. But I really hope Megan Corkrey gets the Wild Card. She deserves it.|`|usIma0vIaa	Well I have stopped watching American Idol.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glwhFXVEA7M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glwhFXVEA...</a>|`|sXpGfHWWaa	I guess..

I'm happy with the results but I do see Megan and Matt G. being asked back.|`|e52fc59476a7f150aacb61d2c03c2bc9aa	i hope she does....but i RLY dont like how they're going from the 36-12...they only have 2 chances to show america<br>  <br>  i'm SOOOO mad cuz in the wildcard that only leaves 3 ppl to make it!<br>  and i already know what 3 i want and they're all guys (Anoop, Rickey, and Matt Giraud) I'd hate to see those guys go :(<br>  <br>  but yea i do like that girl that sang drops of jupiter...so if those guys dont make it...she better LOL|`|8WDKQVQZaa	i think megan will be asked back, and chris did not deserve the spot at all!
mTuykihxaa	The song was made for the movie if that is what you are wondering. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qUM9k1A1nU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qUM9k1A1...</a><br>  <br>  The note sheet is found in the description on the right.<br>  <br>  The song's title is "Bellas Lullaby"|`|qswrz268aa	The real title?<br>  <br>  "The "song" that sounds like a flock of ducks being microwaved."<br>  <br>  (notice I used song, on purpose... Because an idiot like Carter Burwell certainly can't know the difference...)<br>  <br>  Really... I think if I hear Bella's Lullaby one more time, I'll want to microwave myself.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Minimal research would have led you to Burwell's site, and a list of titles from his soundtracks.<br>  <br>  "Bella's Lullaby" is really titled "Bella's Lullaby"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Twilight.html#Scores" rel="nofollow">http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Tw...</a><br>  <br>  ...

ghz5D5iLaa	It was on at my house at 8 like normal. I am on eastern standard time. My husband watched it and I talked to him right after wards.|`|4imsjgE2aa	Sorry, it was on tonight at 7:00p.m. (cst) my time.  I believe you will be able to watch it on the Survivor CBS site tomorrow.|`|IxoazyHUaa	it was on at 7 central as usual
sXpGfHWWaa	Keep it. And that show is pointless really, it is SO unrealistic, but I do watch it , guilty, it is like a drug! So bad, but I cant stop!|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I think she will keep it.  I also think it is very realistic.|`|cW7xfPqUaa	she wil keep it who could have a baby and not want to keep it|`|hThvZftvaa	i think she will keep it but ricky and ben will fight over who is going to be the dad of the child. yes ricky is the father but who will amy choose to be the dad?|`|P4RZK3dyaa	i think she'll keep it. it would be a crap ending for the show if she gave it up for adoption.
ZxLzNWvkaa	If you have a acoustic you should maybe switch if you are trying to improve your singing voice.<br>  The acoustic is better if you want to improve your singing it goes along good, The electric guitar goes better with other instruments.<br>  soo diffently the acoustic guitar.|`|v7iHoMYDaa	Working on acoustic is beneficial even to your electric guitar playing because it is harder. If you can play something on an acoustic, there is no reason not to be able to play it on electric, although it would have a strange tone if it was originally an acoustic song.<br>  <br>  Also, improving your singing voice is always a good thing to do.|`|YtD11EuFaa	You should work on acoustic because those would sound awesome with your voice. You can always play your electric guitar, but now is the time to try something new.|`|nmr4HwFnaa	acoustic is hotter,|`|tKI9lJzQaa	depends on what you like to do...<br>  Do you enjoy jamming to smooth beats and singing along with chords(acoustic is 4 u thn)<br>  or do you prefer playing hard type solos(need i say electric)<br>  <br>  n lets not forget the convinience the acoustic has over electric since is not bound by wires...<br>  <br>  the rest depends on u|`|riBel7G2aa	ACOUSTIC. the sound is so much better. raw you know?|`|Amfv2ItNaa	acoustic is wayy better!
VHxZuaOfaa	Aries they are very quick tempered and they cool down quickly they say sorry and would try to help you|`|MtANnIlfaa	Scorpio. i've done that many times. My rage takes over and I get violent, then when I realize what I have done i get really sad and apologize the next day or something.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	TAURUS.|`|dWeHChwwaa	Gemini. theyre moods and attitudes change constantly|`|YtAkmjoyaa	I don't want to be arrogant or anything, but I would say Sagittarius(my sign)<br>  Read up on it, they really even say it's Sagittarius<br>  and through experience, I've actually beat the crap out of someone before and at the SAME day I'd apologize<br>  My anger scares me sometimes because when I go off, it's like nothing can stop me, but when I cool off I get this guilt, so I end up saying sorry. This all happens very quick.|`|TgGJVbZeaa	i think a leo (my friend) could beat me up. <br>  i think a cancer (me) would apologize if they beat up someone cause i know i fought two people in 8th and 9th grade and later apologized for both and actually became friends with them. its funny, cause i had no personal reason to fight the guy from 9th grade but he was bullying my friend Christian in their biology class and Christian is kinda small so someone had to step up. i still kinda feel bad about it.|`|9KklyOcbaa	Yes, a Pisces would. I've known a few Pisces, one of whom I had a very bad experience with. We would both physically fight with each other. I don't know what the point was.<br>  <br>  Ones that wouldn't - a Taurus female wouldn't. (My friend's a Taurus.) A Libra female wouldn't, although a Libra male probably would. (I know one who would.)|`|cfQHUOKuaa	Pretty hard to say actually but I'd honestly say my own sign: Scorpio. <br>  <br>  Pisces would be the answer. They don't mean to hurt people. And maybe a Cancer too.<br>  <br>  A Sagittarius, Scorpio, Leo, haha. They are fierce!|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Aquarius. The know-it-alls! They are so stubborn and arrogant but at the end of the day, I still like them. They are super.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	if i'm beating the crap out of someone that person sure well deserved that. i'd say why i'm doing it in the process by the way. (cause i'm so empathetic, ha!)
xEWVqdwnaa	no<br>  i have a sagitarius friend<br>  and i love him to death <br>  hes so sweet|`|AA11417199	i say, yes, we can't help it sometimes because we are "Sagittarius" we are good-hearted people and know that anyone we encounter has the power to manipulate, control or hurt us, so we say **** everyone , we're too nice to be their friend anyways. Also Sagittarius have a difficult home life and that doesn't resonate with the public, they might not admit it but every Sagittarius :chiron. has a difficult early life, Then we have to deal with people calling us stuck up..oh it's just a mess..Most of them are independent because we had it trying to get close to judgmental and shallow people.(we can't stand) You have no idea. And yet they call us the "luckiest" sign. I guess luck is all we have to help us get through life..and it's a ***** trying to.|`|yxotSLIfaa	No, I have good Sagittarius friends & they are very down to earth. Sun sign alone doesn't give arrogance/holier-than-thou personality.|`|4d404e77f35a40607906961390eff88baa	Some PEOPLE(of all "signs") think and act that way regardless of your quaint superstitions.|`|IMKfO4g5aa	Definite yes. I know WAY too many girls who are like that.|`|9wSjCIsTaa	No.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	yes.
AA10569146	I caught a glimps of that but didnt have time to read it. What a trip. Bun E. Carlos from Cheap Trick....right on!!<br>  =)|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I actually just saw that and thought of you Zelda haha =)<br>  <br>  Like I said before, I'm really going to have to hear a few songs to decide cause they are just all to different to decide what they will be like now.<br>  <br>  I did not **looks away in shame** I was listening to a really good song and didn't want to pause it. haha|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	I don't like the song but they're certainly powerpoptastic.<br>  I just like seeing James. He still has neat hair.<br>  <br>  Edit: I keep playing it.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Boo James Iha for joining a band with Taylor Hanson.<br>  <br>  Go from Smashing Pumpkins to a Hanson Brother.....|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Hey Cutie!<br>  <br>  That's cool Zelda.

oP3VVW5raa	I wear lipstick to bring out the colour in my face and some eyebrow pencil to define my brows.  Otherwise I don't wear make up because I do not like the feel if it on my skin and it irritates my eyes.|`|nukcYkR9aa	i wear cover-up, eyeshadow, and mascara, but i don't overdue it. i feel naked if i'm not wearing anything =)|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	I don't wear it for sure,i am not that way!!  My wife doesn't wear it either. she is beautiful enough for me the way she is.|`|Z5eaybI0aa	ive never worn makeup but i would like to. but i know i dont know what im doing. always wanted to go to like macys and get a makeover professionally|`|XxVTw5U3aa	i do usually only like eyeliner thoughhhh<br>  i think guys should wear makeup more often=D|`|80lWqRFiaa	Hardly ever these days, but if we go somewhere a little mascara and eyeliner.|`|14gi4aTvaa	I don't wear makeup. I guess makeup is pretty on girls, but not so much that it looks fake|`|7xGtL1vxaa	No,only when I go somewhere.|`|TGqkIaS4aa	Girl- most of the time. Sometimes when girls think they are going to have a good day they wear make up or sometimes the feel like they look horrible so they wear make up. Girls mostly like it when you don't see it b/c they want people to think it is there natural beauty but it is really not. Some girls just like natural. <br>  But that is okay too.|`|547Ln6rNaa	No, I very rarely ever wear make up. I watched my friends at school putting it on in layers, taking hours before they could leave the house and though wow that's so not worth my time.<br>  <br>  I only wear a tiny bit now for interviews and elegant events as I put it on like a five year old child because I've have no practice at it, lol|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	All the time except for sleeping and on the weekends when I stay home|`|vOYyFqxRaa	Yes when in public I do. It's not that I am so vain I just like the way I look better and it is my routine. I wish I did not need to wear makup but my eye lashes are lighter on one of my eyes and it looks funny withour mascara.|`|GomB6c83aa	during the week i will wear coverup and during the weekend i will wear whateever i feel like|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	no.<br>  well eye-liner.<br>  [just on my bottom lid].<br>  <br>  but that's it.<br>  i don't like a whole bunch of gunk on my face.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	No. If I go shopping I use moisture, mascara and lippy<br>  If I go to a wedding or somewhere special, out comes the war paint lol|`|epvaF4eEaa	I used to be a make-up freak lol but now I barely wear it but when I feel like it I just wear mascara.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	I hardly ever wear makeup, it really irritates my skin.|`|cjdPh4Cuaa	No..why cover up natural beauty?|`|bkgBLjuvaa	no, i don't wear make-up all the time... only when i go out. :]|`|rbkWmBThaa	nOpe..i don't wear make up because it can cause aging of my skin..and my skin is sensitive so it gets itchy..|`|bI3areCsaa	I do not wear it at all.|`|c943b397bcbb13a99a8784c80691289eaa	naw, I dont|`|mBXu5G5saa	well not all the time, and not too much!|`|yXB5LOE2aa	I never wear makeup. I take care of my skin, so I look decent already.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	For me, wearing make-up depends on my plans for the day. I do not wear make-up all the time. If I'm working from home or doing work around the house, then no make-up, just lotion with sunscreen and lip balm. If I have meetings or plan to be out shopping or out for a meal, then I'll likely wear a bit of water proof mascara, lip gloss and maybe a bit of eye shadow. Once in awhile I'll do the full "war paint", powder, blush, shadow, mascara, and lip gloss....and it can be fun. I'll use a bit more if I'm going out for a special night or if I know I'll have my photo taken. I've worn 'stage make-up" many years ago...it's so heavy, I don't enjoy it, but I know that bright lights really wash me out.|`|Leo4z1EFaa	I do wear makeup if Im going out anywhere. Especially to work. I mean if its my day off I will go without makeup on, I dont care. Or if Im going out to eat and want to look nice. I do feel tons better with it. I have acne and it makes it look a little better. I dont cake it on and the emphasis is usually on my eyelashes :)|`|c93mCVZHaa	not anymore, last year i would have to wear eyeliner and mascara everyday but know im comfortable to wear just lip balm, i feel prettier more natural.|`|2gTZ0gisaa	no i cant|`|Ybro1x2aaa	yeah i just started recently though.<br>  <br>  all i wear is a little eyeshadow & mascara, and sometimes lip gloss.|`|J0G4lRrNaa	I rarely wear it.<br>  Maybe 3 times a year when I am forced to by my friends.<br>  XD<br>  <br>  Makeup sucks, and it makes me break up damn it!|`|tOd9OuNiaa	No, I like natural beauty.|`|AS8VyrVgaa	everywhere i go i have to have at least eyeliner on. if i dont then i feel naked.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i'm a girl|`|gLJBnqYmaa	I wear mascara to school.|`|Szou6m1Caa	nope and nope<br>  <br>  well just don't over do it.|`|6izJRYn2aa	no...ppl say i look better without make-up on...i don't really like make up and i don't care|`|BDVSOPL8aa	Yea but u barely see it|`|9g734Pjaaa	I hate wearing makeup and never do.|`|m7nrQEflaa	Yeah...|`|Jucak0HLaa	Nope.I never wear **** to school.I look like I got straight out of the bed when i get there.|`|r2T7A9zFaa	no|`|tT6GMdHiaa	nope|`|8nm2psyKaa	i only wear it when my girlfriends gets on me....

And if any more of you tea-drinkers say that you spell words right, you're wrong.  American English spellings are correct in the way that modern English spellings are correct, despite being changed in modern times from Old English.  If you want to do one of those then Germans could assert that you AND us spell words wrong.  Proper American English is at least as viable.  Anyhow, British spellings are often hideously ugly to see or hear, case in point: learnt.  It may technically be correct but it sounds atrocious.  I prefer German over them both though; its grammar, pronunciation, and spelling(including forming words) follow much more logical rules.  Oh and before anyone says anything, German is not an Ugly language.  Go to Germany (NOT BAVARIA, DEAR GOD DO NOT GO TO BAVARIA) and listen to native speakers having normal conversations, then we'll talk.<br>  p.s.

3FWEOGZmaa	wear decent shoes.<br>  i know its winter and all...but i might as well put this out there anyways; DO NO WEAR SANDALS!! hahaha...your feet WILL get stepped on!! Plus its 10 times easier to lose your shoes. I wouldn't take a purse at all, to be honest. Just take your essential items. I mean, you can't have that much fun, when you have a purse hanging on your shoulder, am I right? HAHA, umm...let's see...if you're in a mosh pit, don't be too pushy, unless that's what everyone's doing. Some people will get pissed, and might knock you out, haha...and that's not good. I would stay hyrdated too, because you're going to sweat A LOT. So wear deodorant! OH YEAH, and have a good time! Thats number one! What concert are you going to?|`|jA1ukKSHaa	Go into the Mosh pit if your there for fun.<br>  If your there for the band get there early and get to the front.<br>  When you go Moshing: Hit people Smaller / Medium size to you =D <br>  When you go Crowd Surfing: Don't have anything in your pockets and protect your balls( or if your a girl prepare to get "Touched" haha thats all people do) because I love punching a crowd surfer in the nuts haha. Also you basically get thrown not "Surfed" so be ready to land on people's heads.<br>  It will smell pretty rank but you get used to it.<br>  Watch for incoming beer haha.<br>  HAVE FUN!!! =D|`|BPvchTMXaa	watch your stuff... don't wear loose jewelry. earrings, necklaces, etc... wear something comfortable. have fun.|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	What band?|`|eVeEWbBKaa	DON'T wear any jewelry (necklaces, earrings, stuff like that) great chance of them getting ripped off your body (that hurts...) also, bring only things you definitely need, that means, don't bring your purse at all. Don't bring your whole wallet with you, only a little bit of cash, and if you wear glasses, make sure to wear a strap, it gets knocked off pretty easily|`|XxVNOa6Caa	well if your a young girl you shouldent talk to strangers but if your older dont be shy thers lots of good people at shows that are just looking to have a good time, but my advice is make it worth the money and just remember to have a blast, and trust you will|`|NgQQT2J5aa	byob<br>  alcohol is EXSPENSIVE at those joints|`|fuOL5hYIaa	use your best common sense<br>  like beer things or getting in trouble with security...|`|bf1Wsfq0aa	earplugs 4 the mosh<br>  <br>  but it also depends on the band|`|aFYDZnU9aa	depends what band you're going to see

6mYokEo2aa	At one point Clint Eastwood is out in the woods practising his shooting with his new .44 auto-mag pistol. While he's doing this, a car pulls up and a black male begins to get out with a shotgun. (We later learn that this is his partner). As the man with the shotgun is opening his door, if you look at the reflection in the car window, you can clearly see the reflection of a man with a camera and another man standing next to him.

H9Rthdjgaa	The numbers stand for what fret your finger should be on on that string (a 0 means play it open).  Each time there's a number, you strum the string.  The -'s are just spacers, so the notes aren't all clumped together and so you can get the timing right.  However, most tabs on the internet aren't transcribed well with respect to timing, so you have to listen to the song to be able to play it right.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	e<br>  B<br>  G<br>  D<br>  A<br>  E <br>  <br>  are the strings on your guitar, with e being the smallest and highest pitch and E being the biggest and lowest pitched string. 7 8 9 are which fret you push down that particular string in (frets are the boxes separated by the metal strips on the neck of your guitar that run perpendicular to the strings) the x and y's stand for up strokes and downward strokes. <br>  <br>  Good luck, i'm pretty good at the acoustic and i never took a lesson, pure internet tabs ^.^ Just takes time and patience|`|riBel7G2aa	EBGDAE are the strings of the guitar e representing the string closest to the floor and E representing the string closest to the ceiling. The x and ys represent mutes i believe. I have never seen y used though. and the numbers are the fret numbers where you place your fingers. so the firt set of numbers means your index finger on the 7th fret of the string closest to the ceiling.your ring finger and your pinky will go on the ninth fret on the two next tings down respectfully and then you middle finger on the eight fret on the next string down (this is an optional note in most cases. you dont have to put your middle finger on if you cant or dont want to. it just makes the cord sound fuller)<br>  hope this helps|`|iGUW85iFaa	the ---- represent spaces between the chords. I've never seen any y's in any tablature, but the x's represent a muted strum. The actual numbers correlate with the string that they are on, so the 7 next to the E means that your finger would be on the 7th fret of the E string. The numbers on top of the seven represent the other notes in the chord, so you would have a finger on the 9th fret on both the A and D strings and one on the 8th fret on the G string to complete the chord.  Good Luck.

S4X8zOUoaa	He goes through the natural process. When is he younger, he is actually very old and suffers from dementia. He is getting dumber, but due to aging, not due to him becoming younger.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	That's a difficult one because in the film he doesn't seem to be extraordinarly smart or dumb.  I guess at the end when he dies and recognizes his first love, that is smart ( considering he is a baby when he dies).  I guess he is smart when he makes the choice to leave his family because he knows he cannot support them as he gets younger and he gets dumber when he forgets things as he moves towards the end of his life.  Anyway, it was a strange movie but enjoyable.|`|goe3y4FPaa	dumber|`|DboSRrPoaa	He was still a child like everyone else. Just old when he was born.He is not educated through education itself. Instead, experience is his education. As time goes on, he relates more to people. So he becomes smarter by experience.

6IDBlIaMaa	I loved it it's one of my favorites. :)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I really love it.<br>  <br>  There's supposed to be another novel, but its based on the 3rd live action movie. :)|`|idKfxUTkaa	Yes, it is a good.

In case you or anyone else don't know already, I'm a HUGE Death Note fanatic (go L! :O), but the novel is just so awesome :D and I don't say that just cuz I'm a huge fan of the series lol<br>  <br>  My only complaint with the book is I wish it were longer >.>" I like long books<br>  <br>  Peace Out|`|q7PoLhBTaa	I never heard of the book before but i loved death note and the live action moves were excellent.  I have to look into that i never heard of it before|`|dlsqsAkzaa	LOVE IT!!|`|m1ovmQWCaa	Yes! I thought it was a simply spectacular book (though it be rather short). It was my first time reading/hearing about Beyond Birthday (the antagonist), and I've grown extremely fond of him.<br>  It's perfect for those that enjoy horror/mystery novels. (But not good for those that cannot handle some blood and gore.)<br>  This author has really outdone himself!

eeKlogL4aa	Yes, he should! We've all seen the picture of Rihanna battered and bruised now. I think he lost a lot of support then, especially from the people who didn't wanna believe it was true. Trust me, I AM boycotting him! Only a pure loser would beat a woman, of course it's not right!<br>  I am for Chris Brown to be sent down..|`|b254402c3452aa13b435ab458b526fffaa	its hard to judge when you dont know exactly why it transpired in that way. but i feel that rihanna need to learn how to fight back because if i were her i wouldn't be the only one wit bruises....feel ME.  And yes i have been in that situation before.|`|Reo4hQqzaa	No, If Chris Brown wasn't famous, im sure he would go to jail, which is stupid. Just becuase he is an amazing dancer doesnt mean he can get away with beating somone up and leaving bruses and bite marks.<br>  <br>  [[please choose me as best if you agree:)]]|`|hKyOUVXIaa	I think both of them need to be zapped into some serious anger management classes, with the threat of jail if either of them miss even so much as one class.<br>  <br>  What a couple of hams. Anything for attention.|`|NS1JHMmgaa	Course not. Its always wrong but anybody to hit anybody. Male hitting female or female hitting males.|`|D1HvPYuqaa	go to jail!|`|gUuSmAZwaa	Yes he should|`|q3OLSnvqaa	Can I get a hell Yeah ! (To the should he go to jail question)|`|fz77R5Jmaa	i think he should do some time but not much...a week or a month? idk bout how long but i think there should be some tough punishment like that not just some kind of anger management class crap cuz we all know that really wont make a difference <br>  <br>  he didnt just slap her, he hit her|`|DmD1ypYGaa	naw it ain't right to beat up a woman,and he had a dumb excuse for doing it as well, i think Chris should get locked up for a little while so maybe his dumb $#@ can think about the severity of wat he's done,heck maybe he'll get beat up in jail then he'll really know wat it feels like|`|PN7XMglOaa	" Reportedly " ? He beat the crap out of her . Did you see her picture ? Log on to TMZ.com . He should go to federal prison for 30 years . What if the victim was your mom?|`|ZYr66mvhaa	of course he should be jailed but he probably wont cause he is famous.|`|85dfce96a83fdb7b5c93892243941847aa	So what if he beat a woman are you trying to say that women have the same strength as children, it doesn't matter because girls beat boys too (Oh c'mon!, if not then what the essence of the existence of policewomen and female soldiers?).<br>  <br>  And women say the want to be equal to men, if they want to be equal to men the shouldn't only expect the good side of the equality. Saying that a man who beats a woman is a Coward, is more discriminative to women if you ask me, because it shows that women are actually weak and can't defend themselves. I'm not saying that a man should hit a woman just because he feels he can, but he could do it only if she offends or disrespects him let's say, after at least 3 or 2 warnings to stop.<br>  <br>  and Because you don't her about male victims of domestic violence on the media, doesn't mean that men don't get beat up too. Everybody is hating on him, just because he beat up a woman. The only thing I don't like about it was that, the woman was his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  To me if there's any form of violence I don't what to hear about it's domestic violence, be it man-on-woman or woman-on-man.<br>  <br>  But I'm glad that she has forgiven him and accepted his apology.<br>  <br>  Is that's what you'll be saying when some guy pulls a gun to your head or your child's head and you expect him to leave you alone?, 'any form of violence is bad' but what about self-defence.
1oKkHe0jaa	Yes, I agree with you. I knew that Anoop wasn't going to get into the top three, but then I thought about how there is going to be a wildcard, and I know that it just has to be him. Anoop was the 4th best singer in that group. But with American Idol, you never know what's going to happen!|`|xl5uQj3daa	yes i agree no one can top that|`|YIcBd569aa	they are predicting that anoop and tatianna will get the wildcard but again there is two more groups to go. before we can say who definately will be a wild card.|`|KDaf0L65aa	Anoop is definitely awesome... he better get the wild card, because if Tatiana does, I'm gonna be ticked.|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	Yeah, Anoop should be a wildcard for sure! He was so good! Stinking Michael Sarver stole his spot.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I can;t even watch him sing, those eyebrows are scary. Thanks god he's gone.

The ball was in mid-throw when a gust of wind came by and the ball fell through the hole down to Earth.

So Ginuwine out of those 3!!|`|TJyTAwDxaa	GINUWINE,  I LOVE THE GOOD OL 90'S RnB , I CANT STAND TODAYS AUTOTUNE RNB OR WHATEVA U WANNA CALL IT,|`|YAir7ZcZaa	Ginuwine, definitely.|`|gL0ppoh9aa	---Ginuwine( I can name more hits of his that I like than the tyrese and Tank)<br>  <br>  ----and then Tyrese( I love him as an actor too)<br>  <br>  ---and then Tank|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	Ginuwine.<br>  <br>  TGT should be a good group.
fNKLW7Qqaa	Hurm... I'd have to go with My Chemical Romance. But I'm debating between Rise Against and Oasis... Oasis has better sound, but lyrics are kinda strong... Rise Against has strong lyrics but not sound... But you asked lyrics. So from those two, RA, but three? MCR haha<br>  <br>  EDIT: Now that I understand I completly misunderstood the question... I'd have to say.. Sleep by MCR.

If you are answering a questionnaire that sort of forces you to come up with a specific answer, just think about what your favorite color is at that particular moment and write that down.|`|Leo4z1EFaa	omg me too! i HATE favorite questions. I always avoid them. I like green, but then again i like orange... and pink, oh yeah and red lol i just love all colors. and i just dont really have a favorite movie or anything. We're just odd and indecisive and maybe thinks its pointless lol|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	no..most people dont have a all time favorite and it usually changes all the time.  my color is a toss up between blue and green and my number is 5 i guess but its not really my favorite.|`|rCNRcF5waa	No, it's not strange.

o2FJIXS9aa	I never thought about this one, but I have thought about what they do for toilet paper. My guess is that they get bikini waxes before they go on, which can last for a while. Most of the women do not last the nearly six weeks of the show. They don't talk about luxury items or mention them on the CBS site anymore, but I remember when they did some of the guys brought one. Producers can also do whatever they want as far as how people look in movies or TV. I read somewhere that the women on Sex and the City are digitalled enhanced to make them look younger, so would it be that hard to hide pubic hair?|`|5a8773aa7f12b2785198d4b8359b80aeaa	I think they will eventually look like the chic from Scary movie.<br>  They get no razors..<br>  If anything I would want a tooth brush.|`|lvdao6r5aa	i used to watch survivor and that's a great question but i don't know the answer either.

5cSD8mcZaa	Lust is a gut reaction that has little to do with compatibility. His is a more seriously grounded reaction so as not to get your hopes up.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, he is already involved with someone else but finds you sexy. In other words, don't take it so hard. It is not personal.|`|IIwhkNZuaa	More than likely, he realizes the age difference is simply too great. If you are more than 10 years older, then he's eventually going to be chasing younger women anyway. Scorpios are vengeful and mean and they will stop at nothing to get back at you. Your best bet is to ignore him and go about your life as before.|`|fd13d41ae49947f652119d420e3990d9aa	lol... your story is funny the way you address him "Scorpio Man". <br>  Anyway, lol, I am a water sign as well (Cancer). He apparently is a water sign too. I know a few scorpios. They act that way because they are Scorpios. How much more simple do you want it to be? If you like him, go out with him. He's just acting normal to him. It may seem "not normal" to all other people who aren't water signs.  If I'm not making myself clear.......all water signs are mysterious, unpredictable, and moody. It's a given fact. If you don't want moody and mysterious-don't date him. Otherwise, he has got a lot to offer....I like scorpios!!! :-) <br>  Good Luck!|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	he obviously does like you.<br>  <br>  i would play those exact same games if i were interested in a girl.<br>  he wants to make you jealous, and he wants you to make the first move because he's scared of getting rejected by you, so he's just playing it safe.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	I notice that too. There's a scorpio guy around who seems really interested. As a nice cancer, I try to be friendly with other guys who approach me. At first, he was so all over me and then he turned really cold. It hurts. He starts talking about other girls and I have a feeling he wants me to be jealous (and man it works!) He still talks to me from time to time but not as before and he accuses me of just trying to be nice to people.  I'm a jealous person too and just like him, I would try to make him jealous, too. Now, even if I try to be sweet to him, he doesn't mind anymore. Well, it's his problem not mine. I tell myself that I'm the girl and if he truly wants me, he will pursue me. Not the other way around. lol|`|QZzQdh43aa	either you did something to make him jealous enough to push him away, said something offensive to him, or he's just scared<br>  it's also possible he got bored, and after spending time with you, saw it wouldn't work at all<br>  i would know, i'm a scorpio myself and have done the same things to guys<br>  it doesn't mean he doesn't care, it's just that before he completely commits, he wants to be sure it'll work|`|SF8kwopBaa	we like to be the only ones you pay attention to, i'd say he was hurt by something you did...or that he imagines... corner him and ask him flat out. Then he'll tell you.|`|cjk4eZWvaa	Maybe this "Scorpio Man" gets nervous when he talks to you.  Try talking to him on the phone and see how his behavior is..... maybe he doesn't want to be embarrassed by his shyness or anxiousness.

Then most of the singers that are left are pretty mediocre. Maybe there is a few ok ones at the end. The judges go over the top and in the process of hamming it up insult people trying their best.

This liquid mass is known as rock magma. Magma, in a measure, is like a solution containing in a dissociated condition the elements which, when the mass cools sufficiently, unite to form the various minerals that go to make up the resulting rock. The elements form the chief constituents of the magmas of igneous rocks are oxygen, silicon, aluminum. Iron, calcium, magnesium, , sodium and potassium, named in the order of their abundance. When a magma cools these elements unite to form various mineral molecules, which, when the point of super saturation is reached, crystallize out to form the minerals of the rock. Certain compounds under similar conditions crystallize out of the fluid mass earlier than do others. In most igneous rock a more less definite order crystallization for their mineral constituents can be determined. In general the more basic minerals or those Which contain the smaller amounts of silica, which is the acid element in igneous rocks, are observed to crystallize first and the more acid minerals last.. Among the commoner rock-making minerals the following would be the usual order of crystallization, iron oxides like magnetite first, then the Ferro- magnesia minerals like pyroxene, next the plagioclase feldspars, then orthoclase and lastly quartz.|`|ZvOXs61caa	HELPPPPP!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am8yXmM5mJNu4eXebFdKn5bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226190426AAXlAWX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  PLEASEEEEEE!<br>  <br>  I NEED THIS MORE THEN LIFE|`|AO44fEv4aa	<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+the+lgneous+rock%3F" rel="nofollow">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+the+lgneous...</a>|`|MMYY2cj9aa	Igneous rock is formed intrusively.

But the stuff he writes is just nothing more than what it is.....fast. Check out Alex Lifeson from Rush. He is hands down one of the most talented guitarists alive. All 3 members of rush are extreemly talented.<br>  <br>  Also check out Adam Jones of Tool.|`|oUZLZusjaa	Either one works. However, If someone's just ripping it up and shredding then they may be considered talented but not great (i.e. Yngwie) and if someone's got heart in their playing but no technical skill they're probably just considered a wimp.Neither of them works to an extreme, but a mixture of both (with some leaning towards one way and some towards another) make for a great guitar player.|`|g0mgzjbyaa	no technicalities. nothing like that.

92fyzJkcaa	ok here i go love =]<br>  <br>  The Virgo is highly discriminating, but not necessarily as prudish at some might believe. In ancient times, a Virgin was a woman who was not the property of man, and therefore had the legal right to just say "no." Now, in modern times, you Virgos are known for your ability to be highly discriminating -- especially when it comes to matters of personal desire. When Virgo is ready, however, to say yes, the laser-like focus of your passion is anything but prudish.<br>  <br>  You Virgos have the uncanny sense to see what's wrong with a person, a situation or your environment. It's why Virgo makes such natural critics. Virgo practical analytical abilities are second to none. Your mental process may not be the most creative, but Virgo's razor-like thinking is highly effective. Like the maiden pictured in the Virgo glyph, you separate the useful wheat from the unneeded chafe, the good from the bad. Virgo might be a "clean freak," but most Virgos have a messy closet somewhere or a disaster under their bed.<br>  <br>  The Virgo motto could be "Perfect is almost good enough." On one hand, this trait makes you very employable, for you're not likely to do shabby work. On the other hand, you can be so finicky that you put limitations on your interactions and experiences before they happen. You'll be happier if you can learn to be selectively less critical, both of others and yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  uhmm reading thiss ....sorta kinda trueee cuz im clean but messy at the same time and what not....|`|QZzQdh43aa	Do you visualize the Virgo girl as a gentle, virginal maiden, pure as the driven snow? You may be about to get some illusions shattered. She is no White Rock nymph in a gauzy tunic, kneeling by the pool. Sorry to spoil your image.<br>  <br>  A Virgo woman can leave her husband for a man she met beside some faraway ocean, bear her lover's child before the benefit of marriage, and face a hostile world with her head held high. That's not very maidenly or virginal. There's a lot to leam about this tender, fragile little symbol of spotless womanhood. For one thing, her spine is made of stainless steel.<br>  <br>  It's quite true that she's basically shy. No argument there. Virgo girls don't climb on soap boxes to make fiery, aggressive speeches or chop up saloons with hatchets, like Carry Nation. They don't get arrested for drunken driving, either, and 111 give you a five dollar bill for every one you find featured in a burlesque show. But a Virgo woman is a woman. She has all the necessary wiles and weapons, including a determination to pursue happiness wherever the path happens to lead her. A few prickly thorns along the way won't cause her either to faint or cry weakly for help.<br>  <br>  When you hear of a Virgo woman who has outraged the laws of society, be sure you read between the lines. She is basically pure-minded-true. But so is love. Real love. And Virgo is not interested in any other kind. She'll climb the tallest mountains and storm the raging seas in galoshes and a pea jacket, once the spirit of Mercury has been exalted, which can considerably dim that wispy, chiffon image. Remember, too, that Virgo's true ruler, the distant Vulcan, is the god of thunder. A Virgo woman who recog‐nizes her marriage as imperfect and finds a-love without a flaw (or thinks she has, which is the same thing), won't hesitate to cut former ties. When she uses the knife, she'll be as cool and precise as a surgeon. Much as she hates to break the family circle, the Virgo hates hypocrisy more.<br>  <br>  Once she's accepted a love as true and ideal, the purity of her own concept of the relationship reigns supreme over all the pieces of legal paper in the world. She's the one woman in the zodiac who can be deadly practical and divinely romantic at the same time. That situation of the love affair beside some faraway ocean may seem casual and immoral on the surface. Actually, it's a predictable example of a Virginian behaving true to character when caught in a difficult decision. She'll suffer agonies of em‐barrassment over the condemnation of society in such an affair, but that won't alter her course of action any more than it will alter the purity of her motivation. It's a perfect example of the firm practicality of Virgo's earth element, blended with the mental, airy, ideal-seeking Mercury. There's a white heat to Virgo love, once it's ignited, that can put the passions of other Sun signs to shame by its very intensity and singleness of purpose. Igniting it may take some time, however.<br>  <br>  I will admit that the fiery, physical aspect of love may be somewhat subdued in the typical Virgo female, but there's a mysterious, quiet, waiting quality in this woman. and "passion of the spirit" is a most satisfactory substitute to men who prefer the delicacy of understatement in romance.<br>  <br>  She's a perfectionist, but that doesn't mean that she herself is perfect. She has her negative traits, and they can be very trying. To begin with, Virgo females have this dogged belief that no one can do things as orderly and as efficiently as they can. What really drives you wild is that- usually-no one can. They're also sticklers for promptness. Did you ever keep a Virgo woman waiting for a date? When she's upset or cranky, she won't rage and storm and break bottles over your head, but she can be shrewish and fussy when you've annoyed her. You might as well expect a frank scolding. An occasional Virgo woman can come pretty close to behaving like a virago, but most of them don't carry it that far. Take her flowers. Admit you're wrong and don't argue. It won't do you a bit of good, you can't win with a Virgo. The earth is her element, so she appreciates the creations of nature, and the posies will soften her irritation. As for the apologies, keep them brief and accurate. The Virginian is nobody's fool. Her clarity of vision will spot an elaborate lie by the smoothest talker, and the faintest smear of lipstick on the edge of a collar. She may be pure-minded, but she's certainly not naive.<br>  <br>  I'm not implying that she'll go through your laundry, at least not before you're married. After that, it will be in her house, and she won't feel so guilty about it.<br>  <br>  This girl has a mental block when it comes to admitting she's wrong-like a block of wood right in front of her brain-so you'd be smart to take the blame right away. Most of the time, she'll be right, frustrating though it may be. So why fight it? When you've put her back into her normal mood, she's such an exquisite delight, you w|`|k9MQJTwhaa	?We are perfectionists. We will stress about small, trivial details. Everything must be on par with our standards. This constant need for perfection wears us down, and puts us in a place where we never feel "good enough."<br>  <br>  ? We are incredibly critical. We will find flaws within everyone and everything. And don't bother telling us what you think our problems are; we've got it covered. We analyze ourselves way too often. We can also be pretty harsh when it comes to being honest. Virgos can be quite blunt.<br>  <br>  ? We fool others quite well. Virgos have this amazing ability to fake one emotion, while underneath it all, they feel differently. We appear to be calm individuals, but deep down, we're nervous as hale.<br>  <br>  ?It's very hard for us Virgos to make a commitment.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Gaslight (1944)~This put the term "gaslighting" into our language!<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Paula's aunt Alice Alquist, a famous entertainer, is murdered in her home. Paula, who lives with her aunt finds the body. Police fail to find the killer and Paula is sent away to school. Ten years later, Paula returns to London with her new husband. They take up residence in her aunt's house, which she has inherited. Paula is increasingly isolated by her husband but does come to the attention of Brian Cameron, an admirer of her aunt. <br>  NOTE: You have to get to the end to realize how dastardly he is.

8ca4caa5634d7ad2b0490a296888a44daa	Celebrities don't make good role models. Most people could not relate to them. Who's got that looks and talents? They only create despair and feeling unworthiness. Good role models should be ordinary people who are not a burden to community and care for others because they simply care and NOT for the pleasure to seek opportunities and to create name for themselves (i.e. having hidden agenda).<br>  <br>  My name is Maria and I am 36 years young.|`|ff089db807fb70de1dd4b7a3f911b9d3aa	I think for the most part, they are lame role models.

AA10197672	Scorpio and Sagittarius<br>  <br>  If a Scorpio and a Sagittarius want to make a love match, they should be warned to slow down, take their time getting to know one another on a deep, significant level or else they run the risk of getting way ahead of themselves. This relationship could be over before either partner even realizes it's started if they're not careful! Their patience will be very richly rewarded. Sagittarius thrives on change, on the new and the exciting and on the power of positive thought. Scorpio just wants to get closer and strengthen emotional ties. Early in the relationship, Sagittarius could feel hemmed in by Scorpio's rapt attention and high expectations for love. If Scorpio can control their emotions, these two are in for satisfaction and excitement. <br>  <br>  Both Scorpio and Sagittarius see each day as an adventure (or in Scorpio's case, a compelling mystery) and as an endless opportunity to explore, to probe, to learn. Shared escapades bring them closer. While Sagittarius may get fed up with Scorpio's stubbornness and inflexibility, Scorpio could be thinking their Sagittarius mate is just a little too hotheaded. They'll enjoy learning together, and travel could be very beneficial for this pair. Their relationship is always on the go! <br>  <br>  Pluto and Mars rule Scorpio, and Mars and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Mars is the God of War, opening the door for Scorpio's determined, courageous character. Mars, when combined with Pluto, represents rebirth and renewal. Jupiter focuses on philosophy, higher learning, expansion, optimism, luck and travel. These planetary attributes -- of growth, expansion and masculine energy -- combine to create a sustainable relationship of mutual admiration.

(like what day, or what date?)<br>  I'm getting a 9. so it could a given number of attempts at contacting him; it could be the number associated with a given location; maybe a  time, date, month....or it may be something to ask a numerologist about.<br>  <br>  You won't know ahead of time whether you will meet up with this guy of interest or get a lead on finding him.<br>  <br>  This is a very random sort of reunion and you are asking for very specific answers which makes for a difficult read.<br>  <br>  Blessings<br>  and Good Luck

They don't just study humans of today. They look at past humans and human ancestors. <br>  <br>  Primatology is a sub-branch that studies similarities between humans and other primates. They study it because it helps understand our cultures today. Primates are so similar to us in genetics, anatomy, social behaviors, reproduction, etc. which is why they make an excellent comparison.<br>  <br>  There's also Anthropologists who interact with people of different cultures today. They basically live with the culture they're studying for months, develop their habits, learn their way of life, and even mimic the way they live. <br>  <br>  There's also Archaeology, which studies artifacts and the like. <br>  <br>  And Paleontology, which studies fossil remains.|`|4v6rG1MLaa	Anthropology is.... <br>  Anthropology is the study of the human story. It examines the cultures of mankind and how we all came to be where we are. There are different branches of anthropology. For example, a Lingual Anthropologist specializes in the study of languages as they have progressed through time. The other brances of anthropology also include archaeology, biological/physical and cultural anthropology. Archaeology is the most popular subdivision of anthropology. Archaeologist study past cilivizations and cultures through the examination of artifacts and fossils that they gain from excavation during field work. Biological anthropologist study humans as biological organisms. Biological anthropology is divided into paleontology, primatology, human evolution, forensic anthroplogy (the study of human remains and fossils for legal purposes) and medical anthropology (the study of traditional medicines with western medicines). Cultural anthropologist complete field work by observing a culture/society for an extended amount of time. While completing field work, cultural anthropologist also try to understand the unconsious organization of the society. When they have completed field work they record their observations in a ethnography so their cultural findings can be compared with the ethnographies of other cultures that cultural anthropologist have written.|`|hKyOUVXIaa	Anthro is human, and pology is study of.<br>  <br>  So its the study of...what?

ad9206a3118c0c2846ad7fc9052aaa4daa	Well to answer your first question:<br>  <br>  The more you sing the more your vocal chords tune themselves, very similarly to the strings on a guitar, as you get older your vocal chords become more and more tuned whilst also adapting to the changes in your body as you grow. You can play all the right notes on an out of tune guitar and it will sound terrible, same thing with the voice.<br>  <br>  Second Question:<br>  <br>  The technical answer would be that each voice has a different tone, different volume and different pitch range, for example let's say you have a rock song and you add a banjo to it, it would probably sound really weird, you might be playing a perfectly fitting melody but the tone of the banjo just wouldn't suit the song, same again with the voice, each voice is like a different instrument.<br>  <br>  I also think you could sing any song if you really make it your own rather than try to sound like the original singer, if it sounds bad then chances are that your voice is very different to the original singer so you just have to figure out your own way of singing it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped a little|`|bObtJCAVaa	Your voice matures over the years.

She is remembered for her style and elegance.<br>  At a very early age she became an accomplished equestrienne, a sport that would remain a lifelong passion. As a child, she also enjoyed drawing, reading and lacrosse. This idyllic childhood came to an end when her parents divorced in 1940.

Ow3O7h4caa	Compare Astrology (not Horoscopes) to a road Atlas. Use it as a guide to show you the best route to your destination of choice. If their are bumps on the road, Astrology can show you how to bypass them, go around them, use an alternate route etc... <br>  <br>  If you prefer to not use it astrology as a guide, you can always trip over the rocks, fix the bruises and next time you see those same bumps, maybe you will have learnt your lesson. Sometimes the fall, can take time to fix and set you back on your route.<br>  Astrology can point the way to avoid hurdles, profit from opportunities but, you still have free will to take the long way around or trip on the hurdles and leave your opportunities to others.|`|xbISxnmfaa	People used it to navigate centuries ago and people also used it to tell stories.|`|tQW18Kspaa	To get to know yourself better<br>  and others.<br>  To see what areas of life may be more difficult than others.<br>  Or easier than others.<br>  You have 8 planets plus the sun & moon<br>  which affect you in the 12 Houses(areas of life)<br>  Each House lands in signs(which also have their own characteristics and influences)|`|8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	its for entertainment.<br>  in fact it the only science that has no basis for fact!<br>  dont know why its considered science though|`|d793c7a580124b83ba4c62c6f6a962baaa	They say its exact science idk but it is entertaining|`|SPOuVDE0aa	just for knwing yrself better & in depth.

In my opinion (interpretation), it's about a guy who goes under heartbreaks over a chick who is high-class, some kind of socialite, and he kind of depends on other things like making love to girls that he doesn't even love. I love the guitar sound in there and it's just inexplicably, undescribably awesome. It's not too depressing though, trust me, it's one of my favorite songs of all-time.<br>  I don't think this one would exactly be specified as a country music, but Jewel's "You were meant for me" is a pretty sad song, too, also has a guitar in it. The song called "Islands in the Stream" is a country music, too, only it's not really sad, it's rather cheery, but a good song, too.

0vfX40Qxaa	Make sure the capo is on correctly, and it is the right type for a nylon string guitar.  Sometimes the strings will bend slightly when you put the capo on, causing them to be out of tune, this happens more often If you are using the old fashioned bar with an elastic band style of capo, but can happen with all of them.  Nylon sting guitars have a flat fret board, and capos that have a curve to match a steel string may not work properly.  I have a dunlop capo It works great, you can get them curved for steel string guitars or flat for nylons.  <br>  <a href="http://accessories.musiciansfriend.com/product/Dunlop-Trigger-Flat-Guitar-Capo?sku=361505" rel="nofollow">http://accessories.musiciansfriend.com/p...</a>|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Sometimes if you don't apply the capo perfectly squarely it will throw the guitar out of tune.I  recommend Jim Dunlop Accessories, and I see that Fender does as well.<br>  edit<br>  I totally agree that Hot Summers' answer is the better answer.

yOtVBIOfaa	there was a pre-screening in Chicago about 7 months ago...to boost the excitement level for the releasing of the movie. however, it was a pre-finished pre-release so the final version that was released in theaters last month is EXTREMELY different, including character design & setting design & the pre-released wasn't made 2 be 3D compatible (things jumping at you & stuff) like the January '09 version.  : ) So if u still wanna see a movie with your friend.  I would recommend TAKEN, its very very very good.  hope this helped.|`|goe3y4FPaa	look it up.. thats why there google|`|aLGe7JZEaa	Sounds like your friend didn't want to be bothered hun.

AA11402617	After over twenty five years it has certainly become a weekend must see for generations.  Although they are usually not my cup of tea the musical quests seem to come from the New York club scene.  The weekend update segment has been a standard part of the show from the beginning and is the part of the show where current events are given a comic slant.  If nothing else it keeps it's audiences up on what going on.  Overall I think it has affected our culture on a positive way because it's the only live entertainment show left and it has become a venue where some of America's finest talents have honed their abilities like Eddie Murphy just to name one.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I would say positive.  It has taught us to laugh at ourselves, the times we live in, and other generalities.   One thing that showed me how powerful the show is came during 9/11.  The show did not broadcast for 2 weeks or so, and I remember the first week it was back on Mayor Rudy kicked it off.  It was a moment where everyone agreed it was time to start the healing process...and to go on with our lives.   Any show that can have some influence on American's like that has obviously impacted us.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	In the 90's I had a friend who watched it I thought it made her idiotic.<br>  But since I watch it sometimes now I don't think it really affects culture much anymore.

BjPWJ69laa	Hey there! If you want AMC gear and pins, you can't order 'em online, you just have to ask one of your managers (preferably your HR manager or GM). They usually have jackets lying around the office or conference room for them to distribute for use while working, but you can ask them if you can have a personal one to take home. They'll probably ask for about 20 bucks for the jacket, and they'll order for one for you.

bb4c06364f4edf796a3989cd59729e0aaa	They are both at fault, but of course the media jumped all over Chris brown because he is a boy. I'm not saying what he did was wrong but lets face it! It is 2009 now and people don't live in the old days anymore its like all people need to keep their hands to themselves, and everything would be alright. They both came from violent households and that is not  good at all, u would think that they would learn from those situations especially Chris. I will still support them both, because they are human and i feel that his career is separate from his personal life. Rhianna should speak for her actions too, it takes two to fight and who knows what scars he could have had. Oh yeah, and if Chris would have let Rhianna beat him he would look like a fool, so either way it go its a lose\ lose situation. We need to support them so that they can get treatment and if she want him back they need to set barriers and attend anger management, God is the only man that can judge these two individuals and if they want a relationship so be it,friends and family cannot control LOVE amongst one another!

CbywwVSdaa	I think it means that this Layla girl had a lot of pain and suffering in her life (Ex. She's glad for one day of comfort, only because she has suffered) and she's not overly depressed or anything (Ex. and she knows how to believe in futures) and the writer is saying something along the lines of "she's been through so much more and she isn't whining like I am about these little things". (Ex. All my complaints shrink to nothing) just my interpretation, I don't know if I'm right though. :-)|`|cbzQrz1taa	It's about a girl who has had a really rough life and still manages to appreciate all the good life has to offer. It's meant to make you see that there are others out there who have it much worse and can still appreciate the little things in life and that you should appreciate the little you have as well. <br>  <br>  if you want more meanings to songs you should try songmeanings.net<br>  they have the lyrics to songs and people post comments about what they think the song means. idk having different people's perspectives is a really good way to help figure out what the song means to You.|`|f6wxJvSlaa	well i think its about how even wen life gets u down wen u feel u have nothing u r nothing and nothing will change u r still full alive so live u r life and dont think about the bad stuff just life life and enjoy it!! hope i helped

OrKLpzenaa	1. Even though the book was in Bella's POV, the author still left out enough information about her so the reader could place some of their characteristics in her, making you feel like Edward could possibly fall in love with you. I'm a hopeless romantic, so this was my cup of tea.<br>  <br>  2. My favorite part of the book was the development of the relationship between Bella and Edward. He starts from him hating her to hopelessly falling in love with her. And how he goes to any length to save her from James shows how much he has changed from the beginning.<br>  <br>  3. My favorite character was undoubtedly Edward. He is the definition of a Byronic character, someone who is charming and irresistible and can come off austere (but thats only in the beginning), but even though he seems perfect he is self-loathing. Everyone else sees him as perfection while he sees himself as a monster. So not only does he think he is a monster for being a vampire, he thinks he's a monster for putting the girl he loves in harm's way because of his burden.<br>  <br>  4. I was drawn in by the 20th page. It starts as a curiosity to who this pale family is then as Bella becomes obsessed with them, you find yourself doing the same. Then the love they share with each other is desirable in terms of romantic quotations and just how it was different from any other book I'd ever read, intertwining the thrill factor and romance into one. :)|`|KRcAwLGJaa	it was kewlio.....eclipse is better thoguh<br>  the game<br>  bella...cuz she rox<br>  every part|`|fLPhGgH7aa	1. it was an amazing love story!!!<br>  2. I'm not sure if i have a favorite part, but i guess when edward follows Bella to Port Angeles and they have dinner and he drives her home. It was interesting to finally see Edward open up. And that scene sets everything in motion!<br>  3. Emmett. i just love him. he seems like such a relaxed amazing guy!!! I would choose him over Edward any day! And he is absolutely gorgeous!!( you don't really see a lot of him, just bits and pieces across the books)<br>  4. The love between Edward and Bella seemed so real and I truly wanted them to be together, so I continued reading to find out what happened next.<br>  <br>  Have you read the books? because if not i highly recommend them!|`|MnxXTr7caa	1. it was something new, and different<br>  2. when bells finds out what edward is<br>  3. alice, shes very happy and cheerful...all the time<br>  4. the passion edward and bella had for eachother|`|tRNtFNHLaa	Its interesting to eat.<br>  whenever Jacob is in it.<br>  Jacob<br>  nothing really, just wondering what would happen.
fNa3U5z8aa	Nope, she ends up with Soshi. xD (Yay!  -.- Soshi's mine, btw.)<br>  Riiko actually chooses Night over Soshi.  It'll look like Soshi is history, but that's not true!! :D So don't be fooled....|`|oNC3M9UPaa	Although Night does malfunction, it is clear that by that point Riiko was in love with him (at least in the J-drama).|`|LSn5iF47aa	Nope, something happened to Night @ the end <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (He started to malfunction since he started to fall in love with Riiko and she falls for him)|`|7ZrhsPHPaa	Night malfunctions after Riiko falls for him. Soshi leaves for Spain and prayed he never would came back. <br>  "A girl chose a robot over me. Screw that, Spanish Girls are for me." That is what he should of said instead he comes back after receiving from Night to watch his girl. WTFUDGE?

0lnamekJaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_AE" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_AE</a><br>  Titan A.E.<br>  <br>  In 3028 A.D. humanity has mastered deep space travel and interacted with several alien species; however, a human experimental discovery called "Project Titan" has caused the Drej, a species created from pure energy, to become alarmed and attack the human race. As the Drej prepare to destroy Earth, Professor Sam Tucker, the lead researcher for "Project Titan", sends his son Cale on one of the evacuation ships while he and other members of his team fly the Titan spacecraft from Earth and into hyperspace. With Earth destroyed, the remainder of the human species become drifters and are generally ridiculed by other species.<br>  <br>  Fifteen years after Earth's destruction, Cale, now working in a salvage yard in an asteroid belt, encounters the human Captain Joseph Korso, who requests Cale's help to put an end to the Drej. Cale is initially reluctant but agrees when the yard is attacked by Drej, and the two escape on Korso's Valkyrie. Cale is introduced to the other members of Korso's alien crew, including his sly first mate Preed, a wise-cracking astrogator called Gune, and a cranky but lovable female weapon expert named Stith. The only other human is co-pilot Akima, whom Cale immediately falls in love with. Korso explains that Professor Tucker encoded a map in Cale's ring that will lead them to the Titan, humanity's only chance to gain a home again. They travel to the planet Sesharrim, where the bat-like Gaoul race helps Cale to understand how to interpret the map, and discover the Titan to be hidden in the Andali Nebula. But as the group is leaving, they are attacked by the Drej and Cale and Akima are captured. The Drej eventually discard Akima, sending her off into space in a pod, while they are about to extract the Titan map from Cale. Cale eventually escapes in a Drej fighter and regroups with the Valkyrie, learning that Akima's pod was located and she was recovered successfully. The Valkyrie is able to reach a human drifter colony to make repairs and prepare for the final trip to the Titan when Cale and Akima discover that Korso and Preed are working with the Drej to try to destroy the Titan in exchange for money; the two are stranded on the colony as Korso and the rest continue to the Titan's location. With the help of the other humans, Cale and Akima refit one of the derelict spacecraft into a ship they can use to beat Korso and the Drej to the Titan.<br>  <br>  Amid the nebula of giant ice crystals, Cale and Akima find and board the Titan. They discover via holographic messages left by Cale's father that the ship has the ability to create a completely new Earth-like planet and stores the DNA of all the animal and plant life that was once on Earth, but in its escape from the destruction of Earth, has run out of power to complete that process. As the two try to figure out how to activate the ship, the Valkyrie arrives, and Korso again tries to stop the two. After killing Preed, who was a double agent for the Drej, Korso attempts to steal Cale's ring but falls over the edge of the bridge, disappearing into the depths of the ship below. Before Cale can recover, they learn the Drej are attacking the Titan, and gain the help of the other Valkyrie crew to defend it. Cale comes up with a plan; as the Drej are pure energy, he could have the Titan harness that energy to start the planet-creation process, but this requires him to activate three circuit breakers. Two breakers are activated but the third is not shut. Korso appears and offers to redeem himself by sacrificing his life to complete the circuit while Cale returns to the bridge to activate the Titan. With the ship active, the Drej are drawn into its engines, and the ice field is used to create a new planet. As Cale and Akima step onto the new planet, Cale decides to call it "Bob". The film ends in 3044 A.D. (16 A.E.) with Cale and Akima romantically embracing each other, the surviving crew of the Valkyrie flying off, and other ships with human colonies approach 'New Earth' (Planet Bob) to start their new lives.|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Titan AE

This allows the whole piece to flow, and it's a constructive use of your time. Make sure you're holding the flute parallel to your mouth, to get the best sound. If you do this in all practice, your shoulders won't start to hurt, eventually!|`|PSyVB2UDaa	I've played Madison Square Garden!!! sorry, well what i do is what i call "long tones". in the chromatic scale, go up three notes. first on 4 beats, next one 4 beats third one 7 beats. use only one breath and try and get the beats slower each time. I'm probably younger than you think i am, so please email me stuff and tips. I highly recommend the bach handbook, the ed sueta band method books 2 and 3, and also Seven Sonatas. I want someone to talk about the flute.  with, so will you please email me? thank you and i hope i helped. Oh, i forgot, I played Madison Square Garden when i was in 5th Grade!!! thank you for reading. and also practice scales. thank you again|`|xwAp9faZaa	You should make sure you go through at least three different scales. Also make sure that when you practice you practice it correctly, it isn't helpful to practice it wrong. Another thing is to make sure you practice the rhythm along with the notes. Rests should be counted and all the little marks have meaning, obey them.|`|bIouq64Oaa	Try going back to scales and things like that. Do several octaves, and at different tempos. Also, you can try playing the notes as triplets. Experiment and see what works best for you.<br>  <br>  When I played with the CMEA-CCS Honor Band, they taught us an exercise to warm up: play your Bb scale in all whole notes, then all half notes, then all quarter notes, then all eighth notes.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|OuwzKFOdaa	Just successfully play scales, and learn notes front and back. Another thing I wish I did while playing the clarinet is that it's helpful to have an ear for pitch.|`|8FHj7Ci4aa	work on scales, memorize your chromatic. then just practice every piece of music you got until they're perfected. this is pretty funny, you remembered me to practice my tenor lol|`|TGqkIaS4aa	till u become Famous|`|s2R9fJuvaa	idk|`|k64LIQWaaa	I think it's great that you're asking this question!  I feel like many people practice, but they don't know exactly HOW to practice.  It's definitely a learning experience, and you learn how to do it more effectively the longer you have been playing.<br>  <br>  Do you take private lessons?  I would recommend doing so if you're pretty serious about the flute.  But you can definitely still get better if you're motivated and know how to practice on your own.<br>  <br>  It's easy to go about practicing if you have a specific routine.  I would suggest first playing some long tones or simple melodies to warm up.  "24 Little Melodic Studies" and "De la sonorite" by Marcel Moyse are great for this.  Next scales are good to practice.  I would practice only one or two a day so that you can focus on slowing getting better at them.  Then I would practice technique and tone...maybe working on double or triple-tonguing or vibrato ("De la sonorite" also has some great tone exercises).<br>  <br>  After all of this you'll be very warmed up, so you can work on repertoire.  I'm a big fan of marking my music.  Whenever I make a mistake I circle whatever I missed so that I don't carelessly make the mistake again, even if I think I'll remember it.  I would strongly suggest writing all over your music!<br>  <br>  Also a good way to practice difficult technical passages is to "chunk" them.  Play just the first note, then the first and second note (and repeat it at least 3 times).  Then play the second and third notes in this way, then the first second and third.  Keep adding notes in this fashion, chunking them together and then adding them up.  This is very effective and makes learning difficult runs really easy!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

Its just two lines and his skin in between.<br>  I think its something to do with him being married to God coz it's on his wedding finger, dont quote me though, but im pretty sure its to do with his beliefs.

Well, we went down there the next day, and who do we see, this group of guys again. But this time we seen them going backstage. We were like...hmmm...ok whats up with that? So later that night we go to the Seether concert, and we meet this guy named David. He's real cool, and he's like...hey 5FDP is doing a signing, let's go over there. So we walk over there, and what do you know...the group of guys we were following were signing autographs.

mS7Pq3dIaa	Audrey! Beautiful. My idol.|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	Marilyn Monroe. Look wise, you have to work to look like her (work meaning, change your hair, makeup etc). She has a unique look.<br>  <br>  Audrey Hepburn, still beautiful. Her look is similar and common.|`|875db9dbe2ce224475dab7f10775abccaa	I love them both, really. <br>  <br>  But, I'd have to say Audrey because she had more natural beauty. Marylin had to load on tons of makeup, dye her hair blonde, and wear provocative clothing. Audrey was able to draw attention with a black dress and pearls. Definitely more sophisticated, too.<br>  <br>  They're both glamorous in their own right, though.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	I like them both. Marilyn Monroe to me sounds like Angelina Jolie (exciting!0. I think it would be fun to be Marilyn Monroe for a while then stay Audrey Hepburn forever. So I'd say, AUDREY HEPBURN.

5dc42237ea103510238126df59d3a8daaa	Pop, Rock, Blues, Folk, and others revolve around a 1-4-5 progression, specifically between 5 and 1. In jazz the 2-5-1 dominates. Get a book though there is just too much to learn|`|FVbmJaOgaa	I like to visit chordie.com....they offer a lot of chord progressions for familiar songs.  <br>  <br>  I self-taught myself how to play the guitar a few years ago.  Most rock chord progressions work off the 1-4-5 pattern....such as GCD, CFG, or ADE.  Because the fingering for ADE is so easy, you'll find a lot of rock songs that use a variation of ADE, such as the Rolling Stones' "The Last Time" or Romantics' "What I Like About You" (which is based upon Neil Diamond's "Cherry Cherry.").

Beat Freaks might win it all though because they don't make mistakes at all. Quest Crew has been slipping up lately, so they could lose. Fly Khicks seem to have just kind of skated under the radar all the way to here. They're good and all, but their moves are repetitive and not that original.

Clint Eastwood can do what ever he wants with no restrictions.|`|8CankAcbaa	YES he announced his retirement|`|0yGuaZ6raa	I highly doubt it.|`|dpSTgytfaa	highly doubt it<br>  <br>  he's still wanting Dirty Harry 6|`|gaXUIduMaa	Based on how well the previous one did, I think if he sees a good script, he will do it.  One thing for certain is that he is going to direct additional movies.  He is good at directing too.

u2lYbPT2aa	You shouldn't flatter yourself!!<br>  Julie was there for you, always, when you first lost your wife!!<br>  You both became ver good friends, and enjoyed each others company..<br>  Then all at once, she never heard from you, and it concerned her deeply, and was wondering if you were ok, since you weren't when you were going through some heavy problems...<br>  Julie is not the type to stalk anyone!!  She was only concerned for your well being!!   You should probably delete her, or block her, if that is the way you feel about her!!  She has never lived in a fantasy...so I guess you have misinterpeted her..  She is really a fine person, with feelings!!  Block her...or delete her..   Julie|`|60aa2c1f0300ff1e992f1bde00c32822aa	~~ You are a HORRIBLE PERSON~~! Name dropping is the worst thing you can do to anyone~~! It seems you want to give her a bad name, but YOU are the one who will be seen as the BAD GUY for that~~! I happen to know her, and to know her is to totally love her~~! She is by far the most sweetest harmless user on here and I say that having known her for at least a year now~~! WOW, YOU are a total LOSER to down her that way~~! Advice, get a life STALKER~~!|`|9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	Julie...a Stalker....what are you on my friend, that couldn`t be farther from the truth. She is one of the sweetest persons I know. <br>  <br>  She is someone who is always there for you....a very special person.<br>  Always lends a kind word and helping hand.<br>  <br>  I have known Julie for a long while....and I just don`t get where your coming from or where your going....with this.<br>  <br>  May The SON.....Shine on you.....|`|7aisLVeiaa	That depends. If it's real life, get a restraining order. If it's on the internet, block her. Or just give her the silent treatment, and eventually she might give up once she realizes she's just wasting her time.|`|KqxoYgUYaa	silent treatment.<br>  <br>  I know, it sounds harsh, but it's seriously the only thing you can do after you've told her you're not into her.|`|WNRcUHjfaa	You sure it is not the other way around and that you are stalking her. If you are stalking her you should just leave her alone and get on with life.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Avoid confrontation. Write her a letter then throw it away, she'll find it when she's digging through your trash.|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	u say goodbye with a restraining order|`|ZaO65qpBaa	Calling this person a "stalker" seems pretty harsh.<br>  You say you cared about her and think she is a good person.<br>  She obviously felt the same way about you.<br>  But you are behaving like a child, sorry to say, no matter what the details. They are irrelevant...you are calling a her a stalker and using her name because she used yours? Ha! <br>  If it is true that she was there when you needed someone, then you just disappeared out of the blue, that may have caused whatever came after. In other words, it is your fault.<br>  And if that is the case, you will find that it will happen again, with another woman, and again, it will be your fault. You can't just use a person when you need them, then toss them away when you are done, and expect that person to be ok with that.<br>  You worded your q carefully. I can tell you are both angry, and you did care. You two should talk, if only to settle things, so they aren't left hanging like this, and noone has any hard feelings.<br>  <br>  Oh, and thanks for reporting my q. Do you feel better now? I should return the favor but I'm not like that, or like you.|`|4ZqMC6dfaa	Julie is one of my favorite people, here on Y/A!!!<br>  We have gotten to know each other by answering each others Q&A's!<br>  We have also kept in contact through emails and IM's, and have become the best of friends!  I find her delightful, and not even close to a stalker, or someone who is living in a fantasy! Could it be that she mentioned your name, as to why you are calling her a stalker?(How junior high!)<br>  Seemingly in my eyes,she's fully aware of  "Reality"!.<br>   Have you ever thought, maybe that you hurt her feelings in anyway?<br>   I know that if I were to lose her friendship,would definitely be my loss..., that's my feelings anyway!   I doubt that her many, many contacts and friends and followers would ever disagree with me.<br>      Anyway... This was your question, I'm just answering it~<br>   (but I think this question happens to be a rude,& childish excuse for a so called "Goodbye")...<br>  << Maybe you're the one that needs to wake up...<<.|`|a32118e1eacffc558b54f4d08569229aaa	Are you off your rocker? Why would you ever portray Julie as being a stalker? That's just as bad as accusing someone of being a troll, when that is the last thing they would do! Anyone who truly knows her, knows she would never stalk anyone! Why would she ever want to stalk you, when she is engaged to a very famous, warm, caring man?Shame on you, for she has always been there for you! Julie is one of the nicest people, that I have ever known. you should be ashamed of yourself, for trying to paint the picture in a way, that isn't! Julie has always been there for you, and when you didn't have time, to let her know you were ok, she began to worry about you, tremendously, as a true friend would, and you call her a stalker, who lives in a fantasy?<br>  Do her a favor! Delete her, and block her! She doesn't need a friend, as you!|`|2gTZ0gisaa	later man|`|gLJBnqYmaa	Goodbye, stalker.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	get a restraining order|`|HEDSOHq1aa	roundhouse kick|`|AA12046107	Sounds like a normal woman to me|`|zjEGtuXuaa	ignore them, block them out of your life.<br>  or if its on Y!A block them as a contact.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	**** off. thats how=]|`|oELW89mCaa	Goodbye.

Ct0ESSbcaa	That's a quick way to turn some people into barnacles. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I've found that a few weeks of regular exposure to my unedited, unpleasant-to-many personality does the trick. On the rare occasions when it hasn't, I gave up and married them.|`|ouEix2a2aa	yes. i told him about the problems i was having at my job and how it was spilling over into my personal life. the gossip, lies, harassment, etc., i was experiencing. people at my job were telling stories about me to my clients and treating me nasty. anyway, i was feeling down and crying and he met me and befriended me and it led to something more. he said he would take me for me and not what other people may say about me because he knew better. so, i did warn him and he stuck around for a while. we eventually broke up. <br>  <br>  it helped that he was around to see and hear some things. that was many years ago. so, he loved me in spite of myself (and of the venom that was spread around). <br>  <br>  so, it can work out. it depends.|`|GEf3cV8Gaa	Yes , and I think they have, do you think calling  at 5:05 am every morning to wake me up for work is going a bit too far...and is still expecting a yes to their dinner invitation..hm mm. <br>  <br>  I think we can't just wish it away, we need to consider their feelings , we may not have any towards them, but that is not necessarily the same with them<br>  <br>  I try continually to give him gentle reminders, which he acknowledges, but it changes nothing...|`|ACCIArkDaa	Yeah, I warned him. He insisted. He thought he could make me fall for him without falling for me. I didn't want anything with him. He learned his lesson the hard way.|`|vryw9udtaa	no, i have not. but the girl in "a walk to remember" did, and he still fell in love with her.|`|c85782b5ed49c318025b667d07068015aa	In so many words...yeah, I did.

So if you are a patient person that will be okay. lol. <br>  <br>  Cancers are very romantic and will really care about what you think. I don't think it's a good idea to tell him you are compatible but you can talk about things in common..like loyalty, security, etc...<br>  <br>  A cancer is very clingy and won't get enough of the people they love. Compliment him. Encourage him but don't ever lie. lol. Be positive and uplifting 'cause this cancer guys is super insecure. We need constant encouragement and assurance 'cause we have the lowest self-esteem :-)|`|BBSRuyNfaa	Im in the exact same situation with my cancer, he professed his love for me in the first week! What was crazy was I was feeling the same but I'm a virgo we don't like admittng our feelings so quickly.<br>  <br>  If im right though, this cancer makes you just wanna tell him your feelings towards him, right? I say do what you feel, if you feel like expressing it then do it, dont worry about the consequences. you can never be wrong if you stick to being true to self. So on that note don't let him try to talk you into feeling the same, make sure you do and if you do tell him. In this day and age of playing games better to find out sooner rather than later if what you guys have could be good or is just another game right?<br>  <br>  Virgo girl with cancer boy for one month, fell in love during week 2:-)

gJhwH335aa	Is this the link that showed One Piece ranked within the top 5 of top selling manga in 2008?

One Piece finally took over the second place from Kochikame! 140 million circulation and still going strong.

Ow3O7h4caa	For the Aquarius / Sagittarius match, this is a cooler mix compared to other fire and air combination. Both love personal freedom and autonomy. Both love to serve mankind and in this regard, will be able to support each other's vision for social peace and harmony.<br>  The positive point here is that they will have a fairly direct and straightforward approach in their relationship. Sagittarius needs thier independence  and reguire attention. a fairly direct, straightforward and honest approach to relationships. Aquarius is essentially an emotionally cool, aloof, detached sign and not the type to give praises which may not go good with Sagittarius. As I said before, these two are better off as friends than romantic partners. Good for a fling because both hate to be tied down and as for Aquarius,  they are too stubborn to concede if problems arise. <br>  <br>  As for Aquarius and Libra, both are intellectually drawn based on a mutual rapport. Since they both lack in the feeling department, their connection will be more on a mental level rather than deep feelings. <br>  The good thing in this match is that they are likely to make great friends as well as lovers because both are sociable and very communicative people who share a passion for mental stimulation. Both need lots of  breathing room and Libra probably has a better sense of commitment here. Aquarius is likely to be more emotionally aloof and detached. Aquarius is more impersonal which leave Libra to make some adjustments and accomodate the needs of Aquarius. Having said this, these two have a better chance to make it in the long haul.<br>  <br>  Note, I am basing this on sun signs. Venus & Mars placement would show what one desire  and what he / she ends up getting.|`|Opu49z33aa	Almost a tie. But Libra & Aquarius.

cuIX13BKaa	Whoaaaaaaaaa I hear you! You ar so not alone in this! Primarily having studied the cycles throughout life which can be mind bending as well I see and experience those occurrences more than Would care to say what they are. Hence my sleep study NOT falling under Pisces, but under Aries...made for a more correct reading especially being diametrically opposed to my Sun Sign..what a great night...the staff was as attentive to me as though I was royalty. it was the far cry from the usual patient doc stuff...amazing...so I am glad I missed the night before..people were edgy and that stress I didn't need. Understood Laro and agreed.<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|5l2kTANaaa	When the Moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars..this is the dawning of Aquarius...Aquarius...:-)<br>  <br>  dunno if that is an answer..<br>  <br>  Had a bad Hair day :-)|`|glK5ZCayaa	heyy laro how are you hon? wink*** yea the moon comes along when each star sign is in alligned.

AA12390047	I''m getting used to it this way.  Don't like Nick/whatever his name is<br>  nothing's unfair<br>  Gotta get used to change!|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I liked it better the way they used to do it.  The way they do it now doesn't give the contestants enough time to prove themselves.  Although tonight they said that there will be a wildcard next week...meaning someone that didn't make it through to the top 12 will be brought back.  <br>  And no, I didn't want Nick/Norman to stay on.  I'm glad Adam beat him...Adam is so talented.  Nick's a good entertainer, but that's it.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	yeah, it annoys me too.  its really not fair to anyone.  they get their hopes up that they get to go to the top 36 but they only pick 3 from each group.  the odds off them actually getting to the top 12 is small.  it bothers me too, but i still watch it. lol :)|`|QmSIsUZvaa	no it doesnt give other singers like megan corkery and anoop desai real chances to show off their talent. too many people get eliminated and it makes the show sadder. back to the old way!|`|fjNxzd6Baa	I like going from the groups of 12 to the top 3. But, I don't like the logistics of how they are having Ryan Seacrest go through it.|`|b4f99f492620c1282261b98b1fd8cff0aa	no i really hate their process this year, its too slow and not fair to all the great people like megan joy|`|Hh0Myf2Jaa	yes i like

They just don't have anything to say. lol<br>  <br>  My favorite would be TWILIGHT!|`|BtDGWKSNaa	twilight is one of the worst movies..ever.<br>  <br>  and i'd have to say either the shawshank redemption, garden state, the last samurai, the picture of dorian gray, a home at the end of the world, what we do is secret, the sixth sense, ghost world, the art of travel, winter passing, a beautiful mind, and many more.|`|Z91ePgTsaa	Regarding the outfits, the third column down, the 3rd and 4th outfits, the one with red and the other one with green top and black skirt.<br>  <br>  My 2 fave movies that I'm never tired of seeing are Mists of Avalon and Kingdom of Heaven.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Twilight is definately not the best movie of all time.

q4XUy0Duaa	Nate Dogg<br>  <br>  They're both similar in the fact that they'll get on any track as long as someone cuts 'em a check, but Nate Dogg is a legend.|`|RgymoiIQaa	I guess it depends on when you were born. I am a long time Nate Dogg fan, but I am a newly Akon fan. It's almost hard to compare the two. They are both great!|`|oGW5O5bbaa	I don't think I would consider Akon a "singer" but he come up with some hot hooks. But Nate Dogg can really sing.  He grew up in the church.  On a lot of tracks I don't think he displayed his full singing ability, but he's a legend in tha game, so my answer is Nate Dogg.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Neither are great singers, but Nate Dogg is 10x better. Akon is flat out annoying.|`|AA10687320	Nate Dogg hands down.|`|6gMldg8Aaa	Nate Doggs a legend|`|iCdLXG5uaa	well in mainstream radio if u ask some one who akon is they will sure as hell know but if u ask who nate dodubleg is they probably thinks it's snoops bro personally akon dilivers great hooks and Nate drops some nice beets but Iike akon better|`|AKwebzdUaa	Nate Dogg|`|2Qs5ITA9aa	OG NATE DOGG!!

P8gGMlbIaa	Well that's a kind of a tricky thing to answer. In Japan doujinshis are seen like a form of free advertisement of the official manga and anime that they're based on. It's all fan made art work that they sell at the Comiket or comic market. Most doujin artists do their own material work and the ones based off popular anime and manga are published in low numbers so they go under the radar of litigation, which is why the price of a doujin is so high. Rules of supply and demand, there's a limited supply and large demand so the price goes up. And yes doujinshi's are both regular format and hentai doujinshi which are probably the more well known.<br>  <br>  Much different than in the US where movies, TV and comic companies guard their property rights with extreme prejudice, and will sue over even the slightest use of their copyrights.<br>  <br>  Most manga artists get their start by making doujinshi's.|`|MVlymbiSaa	It depends which country you're in whether underage characters are legal or not. I know they're illegal in australia, but places like Britain/U.S is fine.<br>  <br>  (there's a recent law that came in on january 29th in britain, but there's a loophole in it that allows lolicon)<br>  <br>  I don't think doujinshi violate copyright laws as the makers aren't trying to make any money off of it, just some fapping material.

AA10197672	Very emotional, sensitive, passionate, loving, caring and very loyal. It takes a while for them to open up to someone, however once they do expect them to be very outgoing and easy. They are very defenssive, so its hard to correct them or tell them they did something wrong. They expect you to show them you love em all the time. They can be very jealous if you put that thought in to them. Once they trust you, and are in love with you then expect them to be the kindest, most passionate ppl. However if you hurt them, expect YOU to go after em since they will go back to their own shell and wont even look at you...|`|uFSDEo9Uaa	See <a href="http://yourdailyhoroscopes.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://yourdailyhoroscopes.blogspot.com/</a><br>  Besides the horoscopes, it explains the sign's characteristics, among other things.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	emotional<br>  creative<br>  caring<br>  protective

I love the blues for the rhythm, the syncopation and the emotions that come from the music itself. 45% music/45% lyric, and the other 10% is what YOU feel in your bones.<br>  <br>  Most of my favorite blues come from SRV.<br>  <br>  However, my fave blues "song" was actually done by "Heart". It was the "Blues Medley" on "Magazine". Most of us don't expect a female vocalist to belt out the blues like Ann Wilson did in that tune. She did the blues proud.

Koko Taylor singing Wang Dang Doodle. Robert Johnson Crossroads. How can you pick just one song.

He wanted ego petting. But that's all I can tell you. Not my cuppa.|`|5YPSyP91aa	a threesome with you and one of your friends who is a leo.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Be an audience.

I told my man I would **Never** share with him anyone. Get some really good smelling candles and light them. If u have a fireplace that is good to turn on too!--just turn it off when it gets too hot ha. Surprise him! Buy sexy lingerie for him, get some edible panties, something different u haven't done before! Not sure what is allowed in here so hopefully this is appropriate?! but I submit to my man completely and totally. I moan a lot to let him know I am enjoying it to the fullest--it really boosts their ego. I go down and I can finish in 5 max! DarKKing maybe your girl needs to sharpen up on her skills lol!!<br>  <br>  Also, your man is a Leo yes but he is unique and special. So figure out specifically what HE goes crazy for and do that! i.e. if he has a weakness for the lady in red u can buy the red lingerie, or black and red with black pumps. Give him a back rub; think about his desires. Whatever u do, put thought into it, he will appreciate and love u for it! My bf is a leo and he loves it, I am a cancer|`|QZzQdh43aa	How to influence Him:  He likes to be the center of attention and has lots of friends and fans around him. Learn to be a groupie, but don't shine his shoes. He feels that he can conquer just about anything, so leave some question as to your true feelings,  the mystery and intrigue will drive him up a wall. There will always be women around him, so get used to it. He is usually quite open and honest about things, so you should be able to read him like a book. He likes fun and good times, so be ready to party. Let him know that he is the king and he'll let you be the queen. <br>  A few don'ts:  He may do a lot of bragging about himself, some of  which is exaggerated , so don't laugh openly or ridicule him, that is a no-no to his royal highness. Don't show a jealous bone. He will tell you frankly when a habit of yours bothers him, don't argue or contest it, change it. Don't challenge his dominance or perceived position, or you'll have a proverbial, wounded lion on your hands.

Y1aAGPURaa	Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  Elmer came home drunk one night, slid into bed beside his sleeping wife, and fell into a deep slumber.  He awoke before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said,’You died in your sleep, Elmer..’  <br>  Elmer was stunned. ‘I’m dead? No, I can’t believe it..I’ve got too much to live for. Send me back!’  <br>  St. Peter said, ‘I’m sorry, but there’s only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.’  <br>  Elmer was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home. The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground. <br>  A rooster strolled past. ‘So, you’re the new hen,huh? How’s your first day here?’  <br>  ‘Not bad,’ replied Elmer the hen, ‘but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I’m gonna explode!’  <br>  ‘You’re ovulating,’ explained the rooster. ‘Don ‘t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before? ‘  <br>  ‘Never,’ said Elmer.  <br>  ‘Well, just relax and let it happen,’ says the rooster. ‘It’s no big deal.’  <br>  Elmer did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!  Elmer was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood.  He soon laid another egg his joy was overwhelming.  <br>  As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell…..  Elmer!   Wake up dammit.  You **** the bed!’|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	I LOVED the movie, "Cast Away".|`|Pfog69hNaa	ew hahhaha thats gross

The new one sucked.<br>  This is my opinion - you can't back up opinions with facts.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	The 1st by far was the best, the story line was better, the dancing was actually (although older style ) more enjoyable to watch|`|GfzaszPPaa	1st one lol|`|kcJeZPvbaa	1st one|`|l2A2kCIPaa	wow u never seen the 1st one?<br>  that one is definitely the best :)|`|CnGW2Motaa	I have never seen the 2nd one but I can guarantee that the 1st movie Dirty Dancing is just as good as the movie Grease or even better... and if you haven't seen the movie Grease I highly recommend it!<br>  Also the 1st movie is always really good and the sequel isn't as well. But if you feel in love with the 2nd on the 1st one will be twice as good!!|`|OrKLpzenaa	The second one's good, but the first one is undoubtedly the better out of the two. It has Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey before the nose job, the song "Time of My Life" with the unforgettable choreography, and it takes place at a summer resort. Trust me, watch it and you'll know.|`|sDsCUEvnaa	I saw the first one and I totally liked it.  Never seen Havana Nights.  In most cases nothing can beat the original.|`|FEEE9vcKaa	that one|`|MpI6XJ17aa	1|`|d55D0Ci4aa	The first one is the best one!!  Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were just incredible!|`|yjEBCqSCaa	The !st one of course nothings like the original.
AA12384954	Well, they obviously think your question is interesting, and would like to know what advice others have to offer.  You should be pleased that someone is showing interest, but they don't have an answer for you.  <br>  <br>  Take it as a vote for "Good Question!"<br>  <br>  Looking at all your stars now I would say you either "asked for it" or everyone is in a happy mood today!|`|C3gaC24Iaa	Hey, I do that.<br>  <br>  It means that I am too late to answer the damn question, but it, and the answers to it, are pretty good.<br>  I am a level 6, so I have unlimited stars, so just enjoy getting them every time, ok?<br>  I give EVERYBODY stars, when I check out the question, whether I answer it or not.|`|daij1eBCaa	Yeah, I never understood that. ?|`|493f81eda6065f722ebb134ce91919eaaa	yeah but i also do that lol|`|547Ln6rNaa	Yes, and I just think they are interested and waiting to read your answers too.|`|ef31622afe2e22cbfa13414f8bbb6b0caa	^^ Look at that.<br>  LOL<br>  Yeah|`|9WovIk3maa	yepp|`|fT15YEkFaa	no, never|`|fTjG1KGLaa	ya i do it all the time. its just cuz its info i need...so how could i answer it? lol.....in fact imma star this question, just out of spite lol|`|Azww28cvaa	maybe they like the question and would like to know the answer to that but don't know the answer themselves.<br>  thats what i do|`|q6MDThTSaa	i get that all the time. maybe they think its an interesting question but dont know the answer... at least they should say somethin|`|VTbPYWvaaa	It means "geez, that's a good question...

N8N9JwOfaa	Audio bootlegs of these two shows exist and a good amount of evidence suggests that audio master tapes of these two shows exist, but in almost 20 years I've yet to hear of the videos being out there.<br>  <br>  I read something several years ago where someone claimed they saw Eric Clapton watching the show backstage, but that could have been an untaped, live feed and until somebody ponies up with some proof, I'd say it was just a rumor and no video exists.

Its all about money to them. they just take and take and take and leave their people dry. Its not only the government though.

O27VWziKaa	fruit cake|`|AA11946996	Let me try to answer your questions as best I can. Yes I have emotions. I use my brain first and emotions second. I can make better decisions with my head rather than my emotions. I'm not blocked and I do not have any love bipolar tendencies. Either I love you or I don't. I am very trusting until that trust is broken. Us Gemini have a very sexual energy inside of us. A playmate is good, sure. Huh? We are the twins, so, two. Capricorns are way to serious for us Gemini. Us Gemini will most likely get on Capricorns nerves. You'll probably think that we are to flaky for you though. What more can I say?|`|8326e8ed18368243be0734a4088435e3aa	Gemini men are definitely a man-child and being their playmate is important to them, they want to share everything, they need to that's how they get close to someone emotionally.|`|cjk4eZWvaa	Gemini's are extremely complicated individuals.  They don't want you to know their true feelings.  They keep everyone an arms length away. They are commitment phobic, so don't try to win them over too quickly.  Take things slowly and be their friend first.  They won't let you into their personal space if you move too quickly.  They feel like a tiger in a cage if you don't give them personal space.  If a Gem gets bored or doesn't like something about their surroundings or relationship, they go into a crazed state in order to get out.  The Gemini can be detached emotionally but don't take this too personal.  We do this to keep you an arms length away.... that way nobody gets hurt when the relationship ends. Gem's leave relationships if they get bored, so change things up and keep us guessing as to what will happen next.|`|aeb8ZBXbaa	Im a Gemini girl and I can honestly say for the most part you r right. We gems do try to block out people we do try to keep far away from others. We don not just want sex I trust some people I ALWAYS ANALYSIS things. I see myself in a happy ending. We are fairy tales coming life before our eye.AND YES WE HAVE EMOTIONS|`|bXL9937haa	Well, my brother is a Gemini and u just described him to a T. LOL. He hides his emotions because he doesn't want to put his self out there. The girls that my brother falls for never like him as much as he likes them. And the girls that like him can't understand why he isn't putting in the effort towards love. I have a Virgo sun and a Capricorn rising. I have never really understood why he doesn't trust anyone and the whole sex issue. And since it is my brother I don't really want to get to the bottom of it. If u know what I mean. My brother has a bike and loves beer too! How funny! I think that Gemini's don't have the same discipline and structure as a Capricorn. They don't really hold those things in high regard. They are more of a free spirit type. It bugs me, personally. However, I love him none the less. Good luck with everything!|`|FytJcImnaa	im a 19 year old gemini. just for the record we have emotions more than anyone else but yes its true we do tend to hide them inside of us until we find someone we can open up to! at least that's the case with me. you're were asking if we just want it for the sex well i don't know about that but as is said earlier im 19 and im still a virgin! not that im not good looking or anything im 6'1 ft brownish hair blue greenish eyes and i work out 4 times a week and swim on the 5th however i just believe that sex is something that ill share with someone special not some random girl i wouldn't be able to remember in the morning. we are very sociable and we get along with almost everyone. sensitive in most times like we can get hurt easily. and we are MOODY. sometimes stubborn.<br>  about being a man not a child i really don't know about that but that definitely has nothing to do with being a gemini just to the background of that man :) hope i helped

Dn1wcJlqaa	okay i have a few...<br>  <br>  1) a blond and a brunette owned a ranch. When the bank threatened to take their property, they decided to buy a bull and breed it for money. The brunette set off with exactly 800 dollars. She told the blond she would send her a telegraph when she wanted her to come and pick up her and the bull she was about to buy. So, the brunette traveled a long way and then looked at the bull. She decided to buy it. The owner said it was 799 dollars. So the brunette set off to send the blond a telegraph. The man at the counter said that it was a dollar per word. Even after the brunette explained her situation, he said no exceptions. She thought awhile, and said, "send her the word comfortable." the man looked shocked and yelled, "How will she know to come pick you up with the word COMFORTABLE??" the brunette laughed, and replied "Oh, you don't understand, my friend is a BLOND. She'll read it REAL slow. COM-FOR-DA-BULL"<br>  ?????????FUNNY?????????????????<br>  <br>  2) What do Michael Jackson and Mervyns have in common? <br>  THEY BOTH HAVE LITTLE BOYS UNDERWEAR HALF OFF!! <br>  <br>  3) A blond went into a barber shop with headphones on and said, "Can you cut my hair around my head phones? If not, I'll leave, but i need to know." the barber said, "Uhm. Well, we will have to take them off to cut your hair..." The blond got wide eyed and said "NO! You Can't take them off! Whatever you do, don't do that!!" The barber agreed and sat the blond down, very confused. He eventually got curious, and took the head phones off the girl's head. Within thirty seconds, she had turned blue, and lay on the floor. He realized she had no heartbeat. He lifted the headphones up to his ears cautiously. He was surprised when he heard, "Breathe in, Breathe out."|`|gEKYO6Qqaa	Joe and Dave are hunting when Joe accidently shoots Dave and he keels over.

ZYOJQdjyaa	Classical music is not an actual type as it changes from era to era. Our definition of 'Classical' does not refer to the same music or even the same kinds of music that it would have been referring to during, for instance, the Renaissance.<br>  <br>  Contemporary is also not a valid term as it refers only to music that is being produced currently.<br>  <br>  so, the Baroque period preceded the Romantic period, but there were events between the two - they are separated by centuries.

Can I sing this on next years American Idol?|`|l6bQwXgIaa	it was really good. One suggestion was like you said 'colors all burned together' then 'out of control' then 'we were infinte'. This is just MY opionoin but you should make the chorus ryhme. I mean I know you werent trying to make it ryhme, but i like rymes. Period. ok and also you should post it somewhere and just give the link instead of putting it on the thing and doin all that space. But that wasnt about the song. Oh and by the way if you do sing it, i want to see it. please. I know were just two strangers on the internet - woah - - nvm - - woah i used a lot of - - but still, somehow find a way to get it to me.

qOmtO6dYaa	I think it's possible he was murdered and if he was, then I think Courtney definately had a hand in it. Dead people can't wipe their finger prints from the gun they used, the box of shells they brought with them or the pen they used to write their "suicide" note and there weren't any finger prints found on those things. There's so much more too... here -<br>  <a href="http://www.justiceforkurt.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.justiceforkurt.com/</a><br>  I read everything on this site awhile back and it really makes you think.|`|5g0zCTqMaa	From what I've read in "Scar Tissue" by Anthony Kiedis (front man of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who is also the band that discovered Nirvana) it's very reasonable and believable that his death WAS a result of suicide. Anthony Kiedis described him as very aloof and zoned-out (not the exact words, but basically what he said). And at the time Anthony was too a drug addict but he also mentioned that he was very depressed and that he even over heard a fight between Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain. Yes, it is reasonable that their relationship was so poor that Courtney Love killed him but honestly she isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, if you know what I mean, I don't think she could've killed him even if she wanted to. Hope this helps!|`|jA1ukKSHaa	Well I think he was Murdered because he was O'D'd on Heroin and could'nt have pulled the trigger. Some speculate he pulled the trigger with his toe but he would have had to take off his shoes first because he was found with his shoes on. Courtney Love was a Big "Gold Digger" too. She was to stupid to do it herself so she might have hired a hitman. Also there were no "Brains" on the scene so the shotgun had to have been from longer range than point blank. Also Kurt Loved his kid High or not, =)|`|4Z0G5x52aa	I don't know, but I'm open to it. I can't decide. He was obviously a very disturbed person ("Rape Me") and he admitted to that all the time. But at the same time, it seems unlikely that he just did it out of nowhere. I think it's ridiculous that Courtney has just been completely let off the hook.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	I believe he killed himself. He was clinically depressed, and finally bent under the pressure of that.|`|eG9VG1Pkaa	nope.  he shot himself....|`|wTkvkWscaa	Man, this question has been asked a lot.<br>  <br>  I think he blew his brains out. Delicately put.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i still think he shot himself|`|XxVNOa6Caa	you know what i really like nirvana but we tend to immortalize the dead, and that makes me really mad, first of he was good song writer, not even a great one. when jimmy page dies we wont be immortalizing him like this and he is ten times the song writer that kurt ever was. don't get me wrong i really like Kurt's music but everyone in the media ( especially ) the internet has made him out to be some sort of god. ya he HELPED bring in an awesome genre of music, but their is no reason for everyone to go on an on and on about him.|`|j7imnQ7Naa	courtney did it.<br>  <br>  if you have a myspace, check out this guy who thinks courtney did it:<br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=27522445" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a>|`|O02cXOTTaa	me.<br>  i dont believe it was courtny love though|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	I don't even care how he died anymore. Just enjoy the music.<br>  <br>  As I said to the other person who asked this today, I don't think Courtney is capable of keeping her mouth shut if she did do it.|`|NC67WVlEaa	Apparently, there's alot of evidence supporting the idea that he was murdered but, he was depressed and had health problems and drug problems and marital problems so, I tend to think that it was suicide. Perhaps, he really was murdered but, who knows? I'm a huge Nirvana fan but, I don't like talking about his death very much.|`|SOGkJSN4aa	i honestly thing courtney love had something to do with it. <br>  she was probably jealous because Nirvana was more famous than her stupid band "hole" and she was trying to get all of his money.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	As annoying as this may seem, lol, I don't believe the whole suicide thing. I'm not saying it was Courtney Love, but theres so much that doesn't fit in with suicide that just makes me think.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Yes I think that crazy ***** killed him...... uggh that slime ball waste of life skank....... so she could be in the limelight...... jealousy.|`|wfZTAD29aa	no, it was suicide, 'nuff said

Could it have beena Twilight Zone episode?<br>  <br>  ** I am sooo happy I found it<br>  "A View Through the Window" from the show Night Visions<br>  Army Major Ben Darnell (Bill Pullman) is called in to investigate why a house suddenly appears in the middle of an empty desert. The house is surrounded by what is appearently a transparent, impenetrable force-field. This house is also inhabited by a peaceful Amish-looking family who appearently cannot see, and are completely unaware of the rather large company of US soldiers surrounding and studying their house. Major Darnell tries desperately to communicate with this family, to find out who they are, how their house appeared in the middle of the empty desert, and why their house seems surrounded by an invisible one-way barrier. He also soon becomes fascinated, and eventually infatuated with a beautiful young woman (Janna Ballard) who is a member of the mysterious family. Major Darnell eventually manages to devise a way to communicate with the woman that he has become so captivated with. The episode culminates as Major Darnell finally perfects a method of crossing the invisible and impenetrable barrier, only to find that the "The View Through The Window" was not everything that it had seemed<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0660986/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0660986/</a>|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	I've seen that.

DEi5wYkJaa	wowo...ur gf has a problem!!!haha...how is that an excuse to leave someone...im sorry but i doubt that is the real reason!<br>  <br>  but funny enough i broke up with my bf of a yr who is also n aries, n that happened today..so bit weird!but i didnt cheat on him though..jst too many problems...<br>  <br>  the one thing about you aries guys is that unfortunately u are too selfish..self-absorbed and are not good to see th others point of view<br>  <br>  you also tend to be quite immature, a baby at heart, so serious relationships r nt ur forte...but this is jst general crap<br>  <br>  there is a lot more to astrology than jst sun signs! my uncle is married to an aries n he is an aries and they get along perfectly well..like a team...so check the rest of ur charts to see where u guys differ!<br>  <br>  all the best!<br>  <br>  Edit: a birth chart is the position of all planets o the day and time u were born and how they influence you...you can get one in many websites, but astrodienst.com is pretty good...scroll down to extended charts section at the very bottom of the page, also try cafeastrology.com, this one actually explains to you what some of the aspects are whereas astrodienst jst lays them out with no explanation.<br>  <br>  But honestly, these things should be for entertainment only, like everyone else here, ur gf jst needed some lame excuse. Me and my bf r not that compatible, he's aries im virgo...but I never gave p on him because of that :)|`|1PdUecpYaa	i bet she was trying to find some excuse but couldn't think of one so she just said that to get out of the situation. there's nothing wrong with being aries. that's just stupid. you deserve someone better than that. she's an idiot.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	When did you find that out?When did she tell you?Because the moon is currently in Aries!<br>  Well,Aries and Aries aren't the most compatible signs but they aren't incompatible either.<br>  As an Aries,I say,ignore her and move on.Aries people are the happiest..Don't let that idiot bring you down.<br>  <br>  edit - that's your birthchart - <a href="http://interactive.0800-horoscope.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal0800?name=anonymous&sex=f&d1day=2&d1month=4&d1year=1985&d1hour=1&d1min=0&citylist=New+York%2C+NY+(36)%2C+United+States&lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://interactive.0800-horoscope.com/cg...</a><br>  I had a feeling that you had a Leo moon!|`|r4skENXIaa	I would never trust an Aries female in my life. They're too "in the moment" and don't think things through. I guess I can't say that about your lady specifically but stereotypically I can. I feel bad for you, it's a shame people can't follow through with commitments. Give her some time to mature and realize how well you treated her, if she never comes around, I guess there is no hope. Don't let yourself be manipulated either, keep your guard up.|`|IMKfO4g5aa	*sigh* Aries problems. Well, she's kind of relying on horoscopes, psychics and fortune tellers here. I think that Aries and Aries are a pretty boring couple (no offense). But really. Even if they're fire signs, they're still mean't for each other, right? Your ex is depending too much  on compatibility. Honestly, why couldn't I run off somewhere in the Comics/Animation Section? Ahem, excuse me. Well honestly I suggest you go on with your life and, besides, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Or was it ocean? OMG WTF, WHY AM I MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF MY QUESTION???|`|jlHz0Fg1aa	No, no. This has nothign to do with astrology.  She's just insane.<br>  <br>  Aries are great people, I'm one, so you know it's true.|`|to6JW3yFaa	That is complete bull***t. Ur ex just made that up to try and justify what she did. So stupid. Don't take that as an excuse. She must have known ur birthday for a while and therefore known ur horoscope. Why be with u for such a long time if ur an Aries? If it bothered her that much she could have ended it sooner before anything bad happened. She was just being completely selfish and only thinking about herself. Move on from her, u deserve so much better.

cw2KARcPaa	You are really confused!<br>  <br>  Jack does not kill Locke, it was Ben that killed Locke and made it look like a suicide because he wanted to be the one who got all the credit for getting the band back together, as it were. That has been Ben's angle all along. He wants to be the one in charge. Ben has no clue about Christian coming back to life on the Island, so he has no idea that the same thing might happen to John Locke.<br>  <br>  The reason Locke comes back to life is simple, the Island and Locke are both special, so he is back!<br>  <br>  Mr. Eko didn't play guitar, that was Charlie Pace... you know, from Driveshaft!?! And yes, I think that the guitar case was meant to be a stand in for Charlie.<br>  <br>  Charles Widmore is good (and as far as we know he is only father to one person on the show, and that is Penny Widmore). He was the leader of the Others before Ben was, and Ben tricked him into leaving the Island, and now Widmore has been exiled and cannot return. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend you read up on the show on lostpedia.com... and try watching it all again from season one... you seem to have everyone confused.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	You're getting confused with who's who, lol<br>  <br>  Ben (not Jack) killed John because as soon as he got the answer as to how to get back to the island (Through Eloise Hawking, remember the British white haired lady), he just killed him because he didn't need him anymore.<br>  <br>  John comes back to life on the island, well not really sure about that, it's probably because the island is special.<br>  <br>  Huley probably has a guitar because Charlie (not Mr. Eko, remember that was the African guy) visited him and told him to bring his guitar so it would be like Charlie was on the plane.<br>  <br>  I don't know what I think anymore, lol. By the way Charles is Penny's father not Charlie's.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you mean about Claire not wanting John to know about Aaron. I think Claire has died somehow.|`|c037eed315fdf1456438788c91b9f960aa	Obviously you don't pay attention. When they returned to the island.

hP2nzb2haa	If the party at night...get blacklights and ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula-hoops, and hot potato with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint" (get WHITE halloween/clown makeup). Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Have a super great time!<br>  <br>  Buy some black lights from your local Walgreen. They have them right now and usually always do. (Go to your local Walgreen store or check the website to see which Walgreen store have blacklight in your area, type: blacklight... don't get the cheap kinds it doesn't work as great, fluorescents are the best.) Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party in four corners wall. The lights will have better reflex. Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard patio or inside the house with a big-wide party room|`|8ebGghbbaa	that depends, are there adults present?|`|m5Qh7gYraa	Jumping Balloon<br>  Karaoke <br>  Rock Band <br>  Guitar Hero<br>  Dancing

What's with the re-runs though!|`|AA11765190	That's the one I'm currently watching...
h0LR993Uaa	I totally agree!!! He's awesome!|`|vryw9udtaa	he's okay. definitely not my favorite. too girly sounding.|`|6OrYH4Traa	I wouldn't say Adam is my favorite just yet, because there's still another group of twelve hopefuls to watch, but I could definitely see Adam becoming my favorite.<br>  <br>  So far I kind of like:<br>  <br>  Adam Lambert<br>  Danny Gokey<br>  Alexis Cohen<br>  Michael Sarver<br>  Kris Allen was good last Wednesday<br>  Anoop is pretty good too<br>  <br>  I can't wait to hear Scott sing tomorrow.  Hopefully Scott picks the right song for his voice and doesn't fall into the trap of picking the wrong song.|`|apixtZQoaa	yeah...I wanted him and Matt Giraud to get through but unfortunately Matt didn't get through....I also think Danny is good tooo.....I LOVE DANNY AND ADAM!!|`|eCFAcd8Paa	Adam and Kai were my favorite male performances last night, but Kai didn't make it through.|`|bpN7o6Hfaa	yeah i voted for him too
OWXI806qaa	No, she definitely dies. It's sad when it happened, but you'll notice<br>  as you go through the series that it was necessary. It made such<br>  an impact on Jack (& on the show)  that I can't imagine what 24<br>  would be like if it hadn't happened. (And Jack does avange her in season 3)<br>  <br>  Every single season they mention her by name. Season 7 is airing<br>  now, & they've already talked about her. It defined Jack's character <br>  a lot. (Kim too)  <br>  <br>  Yeah, Teri's death would affect Jack's life forever, so much<br>   that he quit his job at CTU (returning at the request of <br>  David Palmer) and was estranged from his daughter for eighteen months. <br>  <br>  It's also hinted one of the reasons Jack was addicted to heroin <br>  during Day 3 was to cope with Teri's death. <br>  And like I said, Teri is mentioned in every season since then,<br>  the most recent case was when Jack was interrogating <br>  Tony in Season 7.<br>  <br>  Well I hope I could help. And I hope you watch the whole series.<br>  It's so awesome! And it gets better after season 1.<br>  Happy watching.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	Nope, she died in season one.<br>  <br>  :o)|`|BCF6HucXaa	if you watch the alternate ending she lives but i am sorry unfortunately she is dead however when you get up to season four, you will understand how important that is, do not be deterred by season 2 btw it is not the best.|`|ImQ49cieaa	She died in season one.|`|i7vQnBTSaa	It's for real, she really dies...really sad though...Jack does get his revenge in a later season though.  I can't remember which one now..Just keep watching
mfBkH3qtaa	It is Hailie and for everyone that wants to google her, her last name is Scott not Mathers. I am only 4 months and 21 days older than her.|`|3lV7ZY3raa	id imagine a mixture of him and kim.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	im curious to know that too.
C3AW54Eeaa	Ok, this is my opinion..I don't think its Mitch or Victor because you have to remember that Roxy lied to Rex and said yes David is his dad because she would rather lie to him then tell him the truth about who his real dad is, she states his real dad is still walking among them to this day, so who is left that Ms. Firecracker herself would be that afraid of? its gotta be someone that's got a close link to Vicky because remember Roxy had Nathalie..who else could ve been around back then that also would've slept with her, someone who was a bit of a slut himself right??? well, only guy left is Mr. Todd Manning! He was definitely no saint back then himself. He was a wild college kid back then (as we all know, he was a drunk, he was the ringleader to the gang rape of Marty) I bet u can see it now right?? Think about it, he is the only one that makes sense, is still around and can scare the pants off  Foxy Roxy!! Bye guys!!, Jessy|`|ADBMrG87aa	I used to think it was Spencer Truman and Mitch Lawrence would be a real good fit but after what Roxy said today about Rex's father is still around makes me rethink.  Mitch Lawrence was cremated by Todd so he can't be brought back to life and Spencer Truman is also dead.  Maybe Rex's father is Miles Lawrence.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	It's gotta be Bo! Somehow someway I just want it to be him! Today when Rex said why couldn't u b my dad Bo? & Bo said, why can't u b my son? Ahhhh!!!!!!!!it was so sweet! But whoever it is, is still alive cuz she said to herself, something about his dad still walking around closer than you think. (I did think of Mitch Lawerence but he's not around there like she said the dad was) UNLESS...... she went to a sperm bank! Then<br>  she found out who the doner was later & he don't even know it yet! hmmmmm.......... Also, I <br>   think it's<br>   too<br>  funny that David is Bo's son. He seems too young to be his dad.|`|nIMx9Dwbaa	Well today Roxy said Rex's father was closer than he thinks and she couldn't harm the family hmm only men old enough to be his dad is Bo or Clint that are close and alive so maybe Rex is really Natalie's Twin and not Jessica after all they never check to see if Jessica was Viki's daughter only who her father was good story line there!|`|Ihi0lR1Taa	OMG JESSY'S theory is the best.  I love it! I don't even have an answer for this question.  I have no clue and am dying to see who Rex's father is.  Reading Jessy's answer I think I know who it is now. <br>  <br>  WAY TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER!|`|YI9cEtFvaa	idk but im liking jessys theory plus rex and todd hate each other so i dont know well see good thinking jessy|`|AA12336927	My whole thing on this is that the father is someone Roxy is afraid of because of the way she reacted in the beginning.<br>  I think it may be Mitch Lawrence or Victor Lord. I'm hoping that Rex ends up being Vikki's son and Jessica and Natalie's "wombMate" how cool a twist would that be. I think Roxy was lying to Rex today. What I still can't figure out, is why Roxy would be so frightened of someone that she believes is dead, or is the father really dead, or does she know he isn't?<br>  OR what if Rex is really Vikkis son  and she, having come to love him, never wants anyone to find out, thus taking away her son and her grandson.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I believe Mitch Lawrence is going to be his father. After all, Roxie was given Natalie when she was stolen from Viki. Maybe Roxie had something going with Mitch.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I have a feeling that it's gonna be Mitch or Victor, but I also came up with a totally off the wall suspect as well - R.J. Gannon. He was known to be in Atlantic City at around the same time (under the alias Jimmy Glover). He is definitely dangerous. It has also been confirmed that R.J., as well as Hank and Rachel, are returning to the show. Maybe it is a little wishful thinking on my part, but I wouldn't mind a little "shock value".<br>  <br>  I also wouldn't mind it being Thomas McBain, if only to piss John off. I have a feeling that he wasn't quite the saint John makes him out to be.|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Well, I used to think it was Mitch, but the preview for tomorrow shows Roxy saying she lied again.  "He's still walking around town, closer than he (Rex) thinks."  Well, Victor is dead and so is Mitch so they're ruled out.  Miles Lawrence wouldn't really make sense at all since he spent all that time in the hospital. It has to be someone "really bad and a liar"- Todd Manning?<br>  <br>  That would be such a fun twist to this story!<br>  <br>  "R.J. Gannon"  What?  He's black and Rex isn't.  That one would never work!|`|g5RS83paaa	according to soapzone: David sired son Rex, according to the first DNA test. <br>  how weird is that!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Who knows at this point but either Mitch,. Victor and maybe even Rex isn't Roxy's either. This story has waited on the shelf for over a year, lets get it over with! I am dying to know!

1ZeNgdUaaa	Spaced is pretty difficult to not enjoy.  Simon Pegg, the star and writer of the show says it's Friends+The Simpsons+The Royal Tennenbaums.  Which is a pretty accurate description.  It does have a lot of pop culture references such as Star Wars, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Matrix, Evil Dead series, and dozens of others.  On the subtitles they have an option called the "Homage-O-Meter" which tells you where each reference is from, I'll admit I missed quite a few the first time I watched it.  Kevin Smith mentions on the commentary that he got into Spaced because his wife watched them and was very impressed that the show has a strong lead female character.  If you've seen Shaun of the Dead and/or Hot Fuzz it's on very similar lines as those films.  It is what's called a watershed show, which means they use profanity, depictions of drugs and alcohol and one episode has some violent imagery, albeit hilarious violence.  <br>  <br>  30 Rock - Love that show, smart writing, unique characters, one of the best that's on right now.<br>  Chuck - Don't watch it.<br>  Big Bang Theory - Don't watch it.<br>  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia - I'm a huge fan of this show, while it is extremely crass, it's deceptively intelligent and well written.  If your wife isn't offended by anything this show has to offer, then Spaced shouldn't ruffle any feathers.<br>  <br>  All in all I'd say give it a try, I haven't met one person who didn't fall in love with the series after watching it.  I've introduced it to many of my friends and most of them ran out and bought the series for themselves.  Good luck and I hope you enjoy it!!

ykIleAQ7aa	Your signs fall in each others house of marriage. As far as Cancers having issues with their mothers - well its really up to the individual. I'm a Cancer and I'm not close to my mother at all. My boyfriend is a Cancer and he has a healthy relationship with his mother - meaning he calls her to see how she is, but if it came down between me and her its me all the way. <br>  I have known some Cappy's to be perfectionist, but that's not all of them.  See the problem is that things get too generalized so going off sun signs you get surface information that may not apply to each person who shares that particular sign. In order to really see the inner workings of your relationship according to the stars - you may want to get your charts done. There are a lot of free places where you could get your natal charts done to see how you two match up.<br>  But going off sun signs - you're a good couple.|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	You're ok. Could be better. Cancer may sometimes dominate and hurt you. Over react and be very crabby.

dQvKvnVuaa	When politicians start preaching their word, it seems like their filled with  *“INFINITE DREAMS”. Most of the time, they end up being only pipe dreams. They try to sell us their ideas, yeah, *“PEACE SELLS”, but who’s buying? We all have different beliefs on how things should be run. For instance, if you ask a “CHRISTIAN WOMAN” what she thinks, it may be different than an atheist. Some politicians are in it for the power, others, I swear, have a “TOUCH OF EVIL”. They almost seem “ESTRANGED” from the rest of us humans, thinking the rules don’t apply to them. Some of them just need to take a “PERMANENT VACATION” and quit their day job. Politicians do love their pets, though. Who was it that had a “BLACK DOG”? With all the security there, they don’t really have to worry about the pet pulling a “RUNAWAY”. I wonder if a politician that was obsessed with his locks would change the name of the Presidential jet to “Hair Force One”? One thing is for sure: They promise a “WIND OF CHANGE”, but things are just getting worse.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1.

HMteUyRdaa	Because a woman has spiritually more value then men. Women can carry and cultivate life inside their bodies, men can't. They in my eyes are not the greater of the species (they are our equal) but are we really spiritually equal? No, women have a greater capacity for love and emotionally they hold so much more then men do that if they were to act as (slut like) as men did what would this world be? Well I guess we can see the answer to that looking at the world in it's present state. Women have a great gift, we are the fairer, more loving of the species. That is why there is such a greater downfall for a woman who lives as a foolish man does.<br>  <br>  As a woman we are endowed with so many spiritual and emotional gifts instead of trying to become manly and foolish, you should embrace the beautiful gift of being a woman and value yourself.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|1swOxOl9aa	Gamble. <br>  Because that's just the way things are in the gambling world.|`|AA10229962	The situation you're describing is a moral judgment that's still around from before birth control pills were invented. Women had to be less promiscuous, because they had to worry about whose baby they might end up having... It wasn't that long ago that a guy could beat a paternity claim just by producing a couple more guys who said they had also screwed the woman making the claim... Paternity tests didn't exist.<br>  <br>  Now, anyone who screws around is just left to deal with their own hollow emotional emptiness...|`|63a024e9868e83b8b39a0cb132b6d0ddaa	I think it's because we associate a women naturally with beauty. You don't think of a man in the same way. You think of a man as a worker a provider and a women as delicate. <br>  <br>  So when a women puts here self out their it changes that natural image of women being brilliant, prestige, beautiful and etc.|`|AQMoSRrQaa	i am always wondering the same.......no fair eh|`|kn9hQZ1xaa	"It's human nature Perry and you can't change it."|`|AA12004569	It goes back to when men were expected to spread their seed as much as possible. There's always been a double-standard there. Frankly, I despise men who sleep around just as much as I think women who sleep around are cheap. Morals much?|`|47d244d62e953f06f3f23fd44440a3bcaa	A man "****" is a "player" or a "pimp".<br>  <br>  I know, it really doesn't make sense.|`|XORuqFaEaa	It's 100 time easier for a woman to get laid, and what is easy is not good.<br>  May be men are just jealous of that tho lol|`|drI1vsJdaa	Men are called man-whores when they do that.<br>  <br>  Why is it okay for girls to hit guys, but not for guys to hit back?|`|JpfECkjzaa	who cares about labels people put on you.... just live life the way you want to..... fcuk everyone else.... most people are @$$holes|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Because people are IDIOTS.|`|XxVTw5U3aa	delicious and beautiful double standards, milove.|`|4kuWOZowaa	No clue..no clue|`|OOs7FoOGaa	because 95% of guys that exist at this moment are complete jackasse$|`|mv7h2Wjbaa	kus men r horny all the time   :    )|`|GDkw18zsaa	Residue of the lower standards women have held throughout history, however, this is changing now. <br>  In the victorian era if a woman slept with a man her whole family was disgraced; same for if she was raped.  However, a man would be practically congratulated.<br>  <br>  It's just a messed up concept, but again, it is changing to be more equal.|`|sintwxx2aa	just do it with other girls...then suddenly you're freakin HOT|`|0C8lOe6Faa	because they are all sexist i hate that on man even my dad thinks that way but its stupid anything a man can do a girl can do it better its just a stupid society|`|00405875477b94faa18d8ec37279ff9faa	the problem is women.you're your own worst enemies|`|EDD7QbVxaa	I think it's because guys see it as a thing to be proud of, and it gives them confidence, so other guys respect them for it.<br>  <br>  Kind of like how girls can have a bisexual encounter (what ever you want to call it) and other girls aren't that ashamed or embarrassed about it.<br>  <br>  But if a guy has sex with a guy, or just kisses him, that's weird.|`|hRNpGnktaa	Men and women think differently.<br>  Men consider him a pimp, a womaniser, <br>  For some stupid reason we think of this as a compliment.<br>  I dont understand the way women are treated much more harshly than men.

I find that men have a way of twisting a simple Ideal about faithfulness into a compound problem. There is no grey areas here. If one is a player and he/she decides to sleep around then yes, they are sluts. Having a swinging sausage doesn't give an edge or a different name or even preferential treatment to the name or who they are.<br>   I find  Hugh Hefner  (playboy) and larry Flint (Hustler) to be the biggest sluts around as they sell others, images of others and promote immoral sexual promiscuity to sex starved or saturated immoral people. They push money and fleeting fame to young people who are naive to what the porn industry has done to destroy the idea of unity in marriage or faithfulness to one partner.<br>    Those people are the sluts that push an agenda to sell sex. So who is the sluts?<br>   The man who sells it or the women who has been pushed to believe as a young teen that sex  will make you happy?<br>   When in reality, most of those sexually active teens are less happy then their counter parts who are not.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Men are Pigs and women are angels.|`|n4ITRmykaa	I wish I knew.!!! Talk about a double standard!|`|AA11371251	because men that sleep around normally can't get taken women because women can control their urges but when women sleep around it's normally with other womens men because men most of the time can't say no. That's just a thought but I only think a woman is a **** if she really ACTS like one.  If she sleeps with a lot of men without letting everyone then there is no problem but when she makes it obvious that sex is what she is after that's trashy.|`|piI1aWOdaa	coz women hate each other.. men dont mind easy women|`|Vk1FoxsRaa	um...|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Because men made all the rules back then.

Best of all, she writes her own lyrics and she sings AMAZING live..her voice sounds so much better than on her CD. Type  "poker face acoustic" on youtube, and you'll see what Im talking about..<br>  <br>  Her best songs in my opinion are "Again and again" "Brown Eyes" and "SummerBoy"|`|LS6zgscQaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwdXnlvUe3I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwdXnlvUe...</a><br>  <br>  yes i love her.

It doesn't take 2 or 3 days to know if someone is true or not. It takes more then that. It's more like being able to trust the person. Knowing the true person takes a long time. It's like a process, it could take weeks or months. It's better to take things slow anyway.|`|TSn6eczlaa	Be honest in the way you are. Relax and just be yourself. You dont have to wait anytime to ask her out again. Just follow your heart-yeah, it sounds cheezy but it'll show the true you and it'll show how much you really like her. And if things go well you should eventually tell her how much you really like her. Im sure she'd like that..i know i would like to hear a guy telling me how much he likes me and how much he cares. But dont go to crazy. Dont go on telling her you love her on the 2nd date or something cuz i assure you she'll be out the window after that.|`|mnYdiN2vaa	Best way bro, just be yourself. if you two are friend then just be you and she will see the real you... And if you just know her or have seen her around then go talk and try and be a friend, but don't be like a freak you know? like be yourself and relax and if she likes you, you will know... Best of luck Bro.|`|AA10397522	You can become friends, but make sure you dont become a friend only.  If comments about your relations become little jokes, youre probably screwed and u might as well just give up and be friends.  make sure to show interest, put yourself out there.  dont be stupid tho, you want to drop subtle hints without making urself seem like the creepy friend who wants to be more than friends.  If you get in to a friends only situation, be mean to her.  No matter what a girl says, at least 75% of women under 30 like when a guys mean to them.  It may stem from their relationship with their father.  Women almost always look for a man like their father in a relationship.  If she feels like her dad never paid enough attention to her or didnt love her enough, shes likely to subconsciously look for that in a partner.  I'd recommend looking into the father/daughter relationship, its at least a 50/50 indicator, usually better|`|8xczRPRdaa	Your pretty brief in your question...Depends on a couple of things<br>  <br>  1) Do you already know her? (But not that well)<br>  2)Where do you know her from?

If there's no connection for one of you then....off to the next date!!|`|mkvT4BuOaa	Take the person out for a walk and talk to the person and tell that person how you feel and if you be you im sure you're gonna get a chance unless you aren't that person's type|`|BdKagzLsaa	just be yourself around her and Yes be kinda shy around her so she knows that u like her.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  and since i answered yours answered mine :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqVIkxSYmrfaT2yKAPbE0RLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226185359AARgM0R">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ytlf1xnkaa	be open honest in the beginning oh and charming.

Pisces flows with their dream-like surroundings, and Aquarius constantly envisions new inventions and processes. This duo fights for truth and progressive ideas, and both partners are always looking for adventure and solutions. They both get a lot out of introspection. Aquarius can often be quick to judge those who don't share their vision, and Pisces is often overly compassionate, even for those who are not worthy.<br>  <br>  Aquarius and Pisces make very good companions. Problems are rare, but sometimes Aquarius can be too intellectual and aloof for Pisces, and Pisces may at times be too self-sacrificing and gullible for the Aquarian taste. Sometimes different reactions to a situation may put them at odds; Aquarius is quick to dismiss those that don't agree with their world vision, and Pisces is too quick to take on everyone's issues like a chameleon. The pair will sometimes have conflicts, but they both forgive and forget easily. Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Uranus and Saturn, and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter and Neptune. Uranus focuses on iconoclastic ideas and innovative practices. Saturn gives these friends the guts to act on these ideas and the ability to organize the details that will animate them. Jupiter is about philosophy, teaching and understanding, and Neptune focuses on spirituality, so Pisces likes to truly understand new and exciting things. Whenever Aquarius comes up with a new idea -- as they so often do -- Pisces is eager to understand it from an intuitive level. These friends share rich intellectual and emotional resources.<br>  The best aspect of an Aquarius-Pisces friendship is their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge and accepting modern and cosmopolitan ideas. They are well-matched in their enthusiasm, energy and desire for a sincere and heartfelt connection. Their common interests and reciprocal personalities makes theirs a compatible and enriching friendship.<br>  <br>  other than that, yes! i can imagine the amazingly fun relationship you guys have. there are two, a pisces and an aquarius girls at my school, they're so crazy funny and can never be split apart =P

syitFmPvaa	Dally is the one who gets shot not Darry i got them confused to a lot though out the book  Johnny and Dally both said a line with Ponyboy's name after they died i guess since he is the main charter and he was with them the most though out the movie <br>  i loved all the charters they picked the right people for all the parts<br>  Ponyboy-because he was smart and caring<br>  Sodapop- because he was handsome<br>  Darry- he was muscular<br>  Dally- because he had that tuff guy voice and he was tuff and he is hot lol<br>  Two bit- because he was funny<br>  I love all these chacters<br>  i loved this movie i wachted it like 2 times today i guess you can read another book by S.E Hilton she is a great authour<br>  I am so sorry for your losts =[<br>  Stay gold<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AufFE19vNfPD3DfgwEhuhxPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227191325AAvY3kM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  answer mine?<br>  it has to do with the Outsiders|`|QBeVdPBNaa	I love The Outsiders.<br>  We have O.O.D. Obsessive Outsiders Disorder. I watch this movie at least one time a week and make all my friends watch it. I recommend it to all people I talk to and ask all people I know if they have seen it because I just love it. <br>  I someday want to meet Ralph Macchio it's to bad they are 47 years old or older. <br>  I don't know why Dally gets shot then says Ponyboy maybe he was calling for help but Johnny and Dally's last words both had Ponyboy's name in them. <br>  My favorites are Johnny and Dally. They are the cutest. Sodapop is cute to. <br>  I don't know how to stop watching it either it's ok maybe some people feel comfortable doing certain things after someone close to them die. I cried when Dally and Johnny died in the movie it's not bad crying is good and it's bad to lose someone but you won't forget about them. <br>  Stay Gold :).|`|mhvoPAOCaa	Ha ha I went through the phase of loving the outsiders lol.  I liked Matt Dillon's character Dallas Winston and of course Patrick Swayze as Darrel Curtis.

hs9Mibf5aa	Yes, Jerry Sims went home.  He was sick, had bad gas/stomach pains sort of like the beginnings of what Bruce had in Exile.<br>  <br>  They blindsided us, the viewers, with great editing, because right up until TC, - it looked 100% like Erinn with the 'evilliest face' lol - "quote from Coach" - was going.<br>  <br>  You have to see this episode!!  Coach has to be a mysoginist.  This guy was after Erinn something fierce last night, and then to top it all off, much to the amazement of us and Jeff Probst, he went on a weird rant about having TOLD the contestants on the truck "With his EYES that he was the Leader".  Muwahaha.. Creepy!<br>  <br>  I think he began losing it after Jalapao won RC, and he got worse after  they won the IC.  It's quite the episode!|`|lCE5sziNaa	Jerry Sims was sent home because of stomach pains, his tribe voted for him for being the weakest. All other details of this episode can be found at <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/</a>|`|AA11502346	Jerry the army sgt.  Apparently, he had a tummy ache and his tribemates voted him out as the "weakest link."|`|4imsjgE2aa	Jerry from the Timbira Tribe.<br>  <br>  Jerry, the Army Sargent from the Timbira Tribe has complained of a upset stomach to the cameras, but tried to keep it from his tribe.  They did notice he wasn't eating that much.<br>  <br>  Jalapao Tribe won the Reward & Immunity Challenges.  With the Reward Challenge, they won comfort - pillows, blankets, tarp, hammock, etc.<br>  <br>  The Jalapao Tribe sent Brendan to Exile Island and just like last week, he got to pick someone from the other tribe to join him, so he picked "Taj" again. <br>  <br>  "Coach" from Timbira has been complaining the whole time.  He keeps talking about eye contact.  Weird.|`|48oRO9lPaa	Jerry|`|deAyKj2Uaa	jerry|`|dM1jwSGyaa	Jerry (from Timbira) because he was sick. Here's a brief summary of what happened:<br>  <br>  Timbira loses the reward challenge, which was all about cooperation. Jalapao gains blankets and gets the "best sleep of their life". Brendan and Taj both get sent to Exile again, and get more clues for the hidden immunity idol.<br>  <br>  Brendan finds the idol back at camp, by tree mail. Turns out there's a huge tiki thing and he just started shaking it around, and searching for it. He found it up the tiki's skirt, which I think is pretty wrong.<br>  <br>  Timbira loses the immunity challenge also, leading Coach to a lot of frustration. Erinn realizes Jerry is sick, and she preys upon that to save herself (she was on the chopping block because of her siding with Candace). Tyson and Coach want to keep Jerry around, but in the end the whole tribe votes against him.<br>  <br>  Tyson also mentioned how amazing a blindside would be, against Erinn. He says, "I love watching people cry when their dreams are crushed."

LIyqb5Rwaa	My first instinct was 'go with the Fender".  But after doing a bit of read up on the Epi...Man, that is one cool amp!<br>  <br>  It has a tube rectifier and tube reverb as opposed to fender's solidstate rectifier and spring reverb.<br>  <br>  You can also switch between 15watt A and 30 watt AB operation.  Very cool, and a versitile thing to have.<br>  <br>  I noticed there is no effects loop in the Epi, but I'm not sure if the Fender has one either.<br>  <br>  On Musician's Friend the Epi is $650 and the Fender is $900.<br>  <br>  IMO the Epi is looking like a sweet deal on a great little amp!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Al9wADtvaa	the blues custom seems sounds and looks cool, but you cant touch a fender tube amp. i have a fender hot rod deville 212 and love it. i say go with the fender but its up to you.<br>  actually for a cheaper price than the blues deluxe i would suggest a fender hot rod deluxe LTD edition it comes in tweed and snakeskin (python)|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I tried both of those amps recently and bought a Hot Rod Deluxe instead. I did like the Blues Deluxe, but did not like the sound of the Epiphone at all. I have a mod'd Epi Valve Jr. stack that I love so I was expecting much more out of the Blues Custom. It sounded muddy and cheap to me. Cool specs mean nothing if the amp doesn't sound good.

Yg2iIneKaa	a shot story about a transistor radio|`|4c770e93cae766d4352b51d99611c9c6aa	How about a story about a guy who keeps asking girls out and every one rejects them so for a comedic effect when they say no he hits them in the face with a cream pie?|`|unLTNlnFaa	I had a similar project in my Media Production class this year. For our project, my group did a silent mood piece about the "traffic" at different times of day in our school. For example, we shot footage of the chaos that goes on at lunch when people are rushing from their class to the lunch line; in the mornings when there's only a few people in the hallways; after school in the cafeteria; etc. Then we compiled the footage and edited it to make somewhat of a story about lonesomeness vs chaos.<br>  <br>  I hope I gave you a little bit of inspiration! Good luck! :]|`|h71XGaqgaa	haha i have no idea maybe like haha idk i am sorry hope someone eles can help
drI1vsJdaa	Yes. it's 6 months away.|`|WTf21t9Jaa	1 year from now, actually. it's not that long.

kFTXX6fnaa	I've tried reaching her many times in several diffrent ways. She just is very hard to reach, and also very private. I wouldn't give up, but you could just look at some of her interviews on youtube and get acting advice. <br>  <br>  I really love Annie, but it will take a lot to get a hold of her.|`|OOptQPnFaa	you can try looking up her adress.|`|8FMtEW5naa	<a href="http://www.annehathawayweb.com/aboutannie/fanmail" rel="nofollow">http://www.annehathawayweb.com/aboutanni...</a>|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	send her a letter or somehting .|`|ldYCWuXMaa	why?<br>  kind of stalkerish and she probably wont call you back nor talk to you

I5PYvCz8aa	Schecter, Ibanez, Epiphone, Squier, and others all make very respectable guitars in this price range.  The real question is what kind of style and sound you want.  Two things to look out for:  Pickups in guitars in that range aren't great, and locking tremolos are pretty crappy.  That said, I've done well with the open-coil Epiphones, and the locking trems stay in tune okay -- they just sound really bad.<br>  <br>  If you're not afraid to buy used, you might luck into a Kramer Focus for that kind of money.   They were made in Japan in the 80's, and they are great guitars for any kind of rock or metal.  A used Japanese Ibanez or Jackson would also be a really good guitar for $300.<br>  <br>  Don't waste money on a guitar/amp package.  If you already are at a "beginner-intermediate" skill level, you probably already have an amp.  Get a good guitar, then save up and get a good amp.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're going to take your guitar to an independant store to have it set up, you should probably buy it from them, too.   They'll take better care of you that way -- way better than Guitar Center will.|`|9kidx0Ykaa	For an awesome beginner-intermediate guitar You can get a Fender Stratocaster(Mexican made), or an Epiphone Les Paul if you want an electric guitar, but if you want a acoustic guitar you can look at all kinds like Fender, Takamine, or Ibanez.|`|sgjjwXwwaa	Acoustic:<br>  <br>  Yamaha FG-700<br>  <br>  Electric:<br>  <br>  Fender Squier Strat + amp package.<br>  <br>  Both are solid, great sounding, easy to play guitars... BEST of the price range.<br>  <br>  I own the FG700 and it's a beautiful sounding beginner guitar...|`|X3Q5VEDjaa	I purchased a Michael Kelly Patriot with Rockfield pickups, for under 350 dollars, It's a really great sounding guitar.|`|H6b5TbbIaa	I work at a music store, and we use to sell both of those guitars.<br>  I would agree.  Yamahas are great, even the inexpensive ones.<br>  <br>  The strat pack has a great guitar.  You could upgrade the amp down the road and have a screaming rig.<br>  <br>  Either way, I'd take the guitar to an independent music store (not guitar center) and have them set it up.<br>  <br>  And never buy a guitar from a department store.  <br>  <br>  You wouldn't buy groceries at a music store.<br>  <br>  Happy huniting!<br>  <br>  j.|`|Um9jbMPgaa	Knowing what style of music you are after and the price range you are looking at, can i suggest a guitar modelled on the Gibson Les Paul shape. Maybe an Onyx???? or another cheaper brand Les Paul copy., yes I know what the other doubters might be saying but for $300 the solid head construction gives it a meaty/ballsy sound which is great for distortion and also sounds great clean. Go a couple of hundred bucks more and choose Epiphone.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	for beginners you should start with an electric,they fret so much easier than acoustics do,they will eat your finger tips no matter how much the cost,a lot of people have given up playing the guitar because they got sore fingers and just said the heck with it,an electric will make you fingers hurt but nothing like an ACOUSTIC will.after you get some callouses then you can play acoustical guitars,if you get an electric one you can strobe the strings and get the notes to fall exactly where you want them to be,most acoustical are set and that's it,your notes might run off the fret running down the neck and there isn't much you can do about that.also the string height is adjustable on an electric,but not so easily done on acoustical ones.pluss electrics are easier to bar cord on|`|IqnPUQbnaa	honestly DO NOT get a fender squire. it is not my favorite. for an actual guitar get anything from ESP in the LTD's. iv always used them and im amazing now. they are great guitars and modeled after famous signatures. my was only 219$ and its amazing. i play a "ESP LTD EX-50" which i really like. id suggest getting something nice, dont just get a hunk of junk if ur gonna stick with it. at first i did and after 8 months when i was pretty good and wanted to post videos, all of mine were being trashed because of my bad guitar and stuff. honestly get something moderately good. if u have any questions u can email me s3xyst1ne@gmail.com and thanks and good luck. please give me the best answerer.
T0Q2LzwIaa	I would think you wouldn't have to be necessarily famous but just well-known. Because usually opening acts are smaller bands that aren't as popular yet. They might also pick friends over others just because it might be more fun then. So I don't know if you or someone you know is interested, but if you were contact their rep or somebody! Anywho. I love Jonas. :)|`|JReroESmaa	no... I think they ask you to be their opening band|`|tVsIxJwOaa	I think you have to be famous like Demi Lovato, Taylor Swift, and Miley Cyrus.<br>  Or if your a friend of there''s.<br>  Cause if you didn't know them and they didn't know you.<br>  They probably would say no. :)
1wNsBNmxaa	no he did not like school he was exspelled in never ever went <br>  <br>  He was expelled from the Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol in 1918. He subsequently joined the "Bob Pender stage troupe" and travelled with the group to the United States as a stilt walker in 1920, on a two-year tour of the country. When the troupe returned to England, he decided to stay in the US <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???
