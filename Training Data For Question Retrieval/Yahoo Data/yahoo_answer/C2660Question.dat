20090205033454AAf7JmP	Pets;Rodents	Red bits around my rats eyes?	I have 2 female rats and one of them has had small bits of crusty-red stuff around her eyes. She seems to be acting fine, and is eating and sleeping normally. My other female rat is perfectly fine and doesn't have this.   Doesn't this happen to rats when they're ill, or stressed or something?  If anyone has any info or ideas on what this is, i'd be very grateful. I would take her to the vet, but i'm not sure if it's that's serious, and could be something that will just go away. She seems absolutely fine at the moment, but the small skin around her eyes is quite pink (just her left eye) Maybe she has an eye infection? Anyone who knows what this is will be a great help, because i'm not too sure.  Thank you!!

20090205034000AAQRsdG	Pets;Other - Pets	Why does my bunny chew the bars in his cage ?	I have a 2 month dawrf lop. He lives in the house in a cage in my sitting room. He has just started biting the bars on his cage all of a suden.      Since getting him 1 month ago he runs around for about 5 hours a night when I am home. He has full access to the sitting room and bedroom and has 3 tunnels and a pop up house to mess around with.      He was trained and went to his cage to poo and wee in the past but suddenly started pooing on the carpet (shortly after taking him to the vet for an injection - not sure if thiss has anything to do with that) But when putting him back in his cage he has started biting his bars constantly.       In his cage he has a sandstone to chew on, a cupcake made of the same thing, a willow ball, a hanging herb toy to eat, and carrot water....so he cant possibly be bored?!      Any ideas?

20090205040811AAUfN1l	Pets;Horses	If my mare turns out to be bred by her own baby will it have problems?	He is at the trainers and gotten cut. I have been very very ill this last year and wasn't able to devote the attention to them as I would have normally. I was in and out of the hospital and seeing specialists constantly and on meds and having seizures ETC. It was a rough time for me. So I wasn't intentionally ignoring the possibility of him breeding with her.I never actually saw her breed with him. But as I stated i was very ill and it still could have happened while we were on the waiting list for him to go to the trainers. She is not even showing so this is hypothetical at this point. But just in case I wanted some input. My mare is a registered palomino quarter horse. Her entire line is inbred intentionally but not even close to mother and son. I would not have even remotely allowed this to happen intentionally. I hope she is not bred, but if she is I would want to keep it and take care of it. Hoping it wouldn't be deformed in any way. Does anyone have any experiences/advice in these type of situations? Oh and please dont lecture me on how irresponsiable it was not to have him cut sooner. I have already beat myself up over it enough and sometimes life just doesnt go to plan. Thanks again!

20090205043601AAIRQro	Pets;Dogs	Cocker Spaniel Questions?	I have a six month old male Cocker Spaniel (Porthos). He's very good natured towards me and my family, but takes a day or two to adjust to strangers - he growls at them and keeps his distance, he's even had a snap at someone who tried to pat him once. Is this normal behavior for Spaniels. I'm scared to bring him into contact with just anyone for fear that he might have a snap at them. He's had this shy and wary personality trade since we got him at 8 weeks and we figured he might grow out of it, but he hasn't. Is there anything I can do to that would make him feel more comfortable with other humans??    Also, in the last 2 weeks or so he's become very over protective of me, even towards my family (will start growling when they get too close) - I would appreciate it if anyone can suggest some ways or training techniques to get rid of this behavior.

20090205041618AAJfLbU	Pets;Dogs	If my dog had ingrown hairs does he need to get them surgically removed?	I have a 5 month old yorkshire terrier, whose hair is constantly growing. He had a lump on his head, and the vet said it was a cyst (ingrown hair), so he popped it. A few weeks later the lump had become a huge patch of lumps, and the vet said they were not dangerous but he would like to cut them out. The surgery will cost $200, then a further $100 to send it to the lab. My dog trainer thinks it is an unnecessary surgery. Does my dog need this surgery, because its very expensive. But if it is going to cause problems then i would rather remove it. What should i do? Has anyone had this problem before?

I can tell him to "shhhhh" or "BE QUIET" a million times, and it won't help. Eventually I just get up, take him outside, and then I'm awake for the rest of the night.      How can I stop this? I KNOW he is capable of holding it, because he sometimes has to hold it 8 hours, on days, where I don't get home to take him out.

We have only given her some chicken cut up before, but not really anything else but it seemed to have made quite the impression on her.

Everytime she hears the beep of something being done in the microwave, she darts from wherever she is in the house to the kitchen.  It's funny but at the same time, it can't be good.  Whenever I have a treat for her, all I can think of is that dog commercial where the puppy is jumping up and down going "bacon bacon bacon!!" it's like her whole body vibrates in excitement for anything that shes able to eat.

20090205064742AAGZGyr	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone feed Wellness Super 5 Mix?	My dog is about 14 months old, almost 26 pounds and very active. He was diagnosed with environmental allergies about 1 month ago. A little over 2 weeks ago I switched him from Purina ProPlan shredded chicken to Wellness Super 5 Mix Whitefish and Sweet Potato formula after much research and cost/benefit analysis. This formula is also supposed to help dogs with allergies. He was doing fine on the Purina, but his constant itching and little skin rashes got me worried he might be allergic to something in that formula even though the vet assures me he does not appear to have food allergies.      He ate the Wellness food for two weeks with no problems at all. Yesterday he threw up all of his morning meal 1 hour after eating and then vomited again at around 1 pm. I took him to the vet, and after the examination, x-rays, and a $250 bill I was sent home with a diagnosis of "gastritis." Besides a huge lecture about how the "trendy" foods are not any better for the dog than Iams or Purina, the only thing the vet had to say was that the food had nothing to do with the vomiting episodes. So he has an upset stomach with no known cause.       Could he be reacting to something on the food? Has anyone here ever fed this food and had the same experience? The dog is a little sleepy and tired today, and he has done a lot of licking his lips and gulping, but he has not vomited again. No diarrhea so far either.

20090205063810AA1UQqV	Pets;Cats	Cat keeps jumping up on Kitchen Counter?	He is 9 months old male cat. He knows what he is doing is wrong since he sometimes runs when I hear him in the sink and start coming at him from another room. I live in an 2 bedroom apartment and when I go to bed I hear him in my sink, licking all my dirty dishes, or trying to get into my banana bread i just made on the counter. Been a problem for 2 weeks now and I CONSTANTLY spray him in the face every time I catch him, yell, and push him off the counter. Last night it happened alllll night. I am going to have to buy a food cover but any other ideas anyone? Or just keep doing what im doing with the spraying in the face.
20090205064319AAt2TNO	Pets;Horses	How much do horse trailers usually weigh?	I'm looking to get a new trailer and I drive around a steel one now which my truck has a lot of problems with. The woman says the steel trailer weighs 1000 pounds but I'm looking to get a newer aluminum one to help my truck out and the lady who's selling it to me said that that one weighs 2600. Who is correct with the weight? My truck is supposed to be able to pull 5000 pounds so I'm thinking the first lady who gave me that steel trailer was wrong...
20090205053034AAXzDw6	Pets;Fish	Is it ok to put a female betta in with my guppy?	I have a guppy, and I'm not sure if she's prego or not (she's kinda big and I had a male in with her at one point), that I've had for about three weeks, and although her bowl is right next to another bowl with other fish in it that she can see, I'm afraid that she's lonely and I want to get a female betta to keep her company. I would get more guppies, but every time I get guppies, they all die on me the next day; the one I have is the only one that's ever lived. However, I seem to be good at keeping bettas alive, so before I get her a "friend" I need to know if it's ok to put a guppy and a female betta together. Also, if I do that and my guppy has babies, will the betta eat the babies?

20090205062319AAUB5yU	Pets;Cats	Have a question for all Manx owners past and present?	I have a 10 month old stumpy female, Spark Plug, aka Sparky.  I've always loved the look of a Manx though I've never owned one before.  She's not a pure bred though, as far as I know, I got her from a local horse farm when she was about 4 weeks old.  Too young I know, but they didn't want the kits around, but yet refuse to spay or neuter their cats.  I took her to the vet as soon as I got her, he told me that she is indeed a female, and that she's in good health.  I also did a lot of reading on the breed, so I know that they mature slower than other cats and I also know that they aren't the most vocal of felines.  I also read that you're supposed to wait until they come into heat once to spay them.  She's 10 months old now, and I don't think she's come into season.  I'd just take her to the vet to have her checked again, but my vet hasn't been around very much the last few months as his father lives in Florida and is very, very ill.  He brought another vet in to cover while he's gone, but I think he regrets his choice of vets as he told me not to see this other vet.  Where we live is pretty rural, and I'm sure the pickings were slim.  He's also been our family vet for over 20 years and is very protective of our animals.  The only other vet within an hour's drive is a large animal vet who isn't taking new patients.  So I wanted to ask the Manx people on here if they've every experienced this.  Could she have come into heat and I missed it because the breed, and her herself are so quiet?  Could it just be the maturing slowly thing?  I also read that when you show a female Manx, as a pet anyway, that you should alter them because being around the males can bring them into heat.  Do I have to bring her around a male to make her come into heat?  If so, can he be neutered?  My mom has a neutered male and I could bring Sparky over to her house for a few hours.  Do I really have to wait for her to come into season for her to be spayed?  I haven't with any of my other cats, but what I read about Manxes says that I should because it prolongs their life.  If I don't have to, I'll just take her to the vet when he's back in town next month.  Any info is greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

The critter is about 2 and 1/2 inches long, gray, has four short stubby little legs, and is a little slimy. At first when I was looking through the dirt and saw it, I thought it was a worm, but then I noticed "omg, it has legs!" So my next instinct was that it may be a Salamander, but it's a bit too small. Maybe it's a baby Salamander? I have a few pictures if you'd like to see, just IM or e-mail me and I'll send them to you.  I'm hoping to keep it as a pet, but I really would like to know what it is first!

Just to look at him you cant really tell that much, but as soon as you pick him up, you can feel it. It's quite firm, but doean't seem to be causing him any pain.

I called a vet and made an appointment for late in the day (only one available) but I'm so worried.  Do you have any ideas what it could be?  It is right by his bum, it is swollen and it is blood red.  He seems to be going to the washroom and eating well.  Thank you.

20090205060425AAu23j8	Pets;Birds	Information on finches....?	I recently bought an Australian Shaft Tailed Finch. Before I bought it the sales lady told me to be careful not to let him out of his cage for fear that he might fly head first into a wall,window,or mirror.Not only that,they poop a LOT and are hard to catch.   I put him in a decent size cage.He has food,water,a bath,a nest, a swing,and two horizontal poles to sit on. I want to be able to have him fly around a bit and feed him out of my hand. He's a very pretty bird and sings a nice tune. But I can't even get a hand on him to take him out of the cage - he's fast.   I want to get him a companion,but not another finch.   I'd appreciate any recommendations in reference to what I mentioned. Preferably by those who have owned this type of bird. I don't care if you had a parrot,parakeet or any other kind of bird. Before I got the bird,I asked question on finches and got a whole bunch of responses about everything EXCEPT how to take care of a finch. And please save your "you should have gotten information before you bought the bird' b.s. because it wont help or make a difference.     Info on FINCHES or birds compatible with them is all I need.  Thanks a lot.
20090205060445AAqRCdL	Pets;Cats	The case of the pillow peer?	Okay, so this is the deal.      -First off, he is NOT spraying.  I know what spraying looks like and it doesn’t look like emptying the bladder.  Please do not tell me he is spraying.  He isn’t.  Every time he does this he makes a giant puddle=not spraying.      I got a kitten about 2 months back and he’s cute.  Playful, friendly.  He also had this problem where he loved to pee on paper and plastic bags.  So I cleaned up the house (oh my!) and there is not a bit of paper or plastic on the floor and the problem was solved…for about a day. I had him fixed thinking that perhaps that will solve the problem but it hasn’t.         Then the kitten decided that peeing on the PILLOWS was the best alternative.  At first I thought nothing of it and just washed everything.  Then he did it again and I became annoyed.  Then he did it this morning only I was laying on the pillow sleeping at the time…now it has risen to unacceptable.      I have tried the sticking his nose in it and saying “no” forcefully but I don’t think he understands or at least hasn’t yet.  I wash his behind every time (because it gets all over him when he does it) and had the slight hope that would deter him but it hasn’t.  I called the vet and asked about it being a urinary problem but with it being specific things that he pees on that is unlikely.  So here are my thoughts but I would be open to second opinions:      -Buy that recycled paper litter stuff.  I can’t find it for cats but would the small critter bedding work just fine?  It’s paper so maybe he would be attracted to that.      -Spray some of that “scare the cat away” stuff all over my bed but I seriously don’t want to sleep in that and my older cat loves to sleep peacefully at the foot of the bed      -Close the cats off completely from the bedroom.  See above for why I don’t want to.      Any more suggestions?  Comments?  Any of my ideas sound horrible?  I would appreciate any help because, seriously, nothing wakes you up faster at 3am than waking up in a puddle of kitten pee.

20090205064217AAL1mfb	Pets;Dogs	One small local park + One small aggressive dog?	Hi people. :)   I'm just in need of a bit of advice.   Near my house is a lovely small park area that is not littered in dog foul (people have respect for this park) and is cleaned every day.   It's a great place to sit and relax and it is also close to town, the doctors and dentist and university, I cut through this park every day to go to uni'.      I have a puppy, we have had her three weeks now andshe isvery friendly, gets on with other dogs, loves humans and we have trained her in basic obediance.    I would love to take her to this park to play, only there is one problem.   There is this woman who (possibly lives near by) is in this park daily, she is carless and owns a very aggressive mini jack russel. When this lady is there, the park is empty. When she's absent, there are a few people and dogs (even a local chubby cat).      I have walked through the park when this lady is present and each time, this dog has charged towards me barking frantacly with its tail in the air, standing in my path, followning me, staying close to my feet.   I'm no longer affraid of dogs, so I will keep on moving forward ignoring it, yet all this woman does is giggle or remain oblivious.   I have also heard this dog (jack russels are loud) barking when other people have cut through the park.   This dog has a habbit of hiding in bushes near one of the entrance/exits then charging people from there.   I would never let my dog carry on like this, she's just a puppy, yet when she gets hyper excited, I'll wait untill she calms down or tell her to sit before she recives attention.      I'm not sure weather to bring my dog to this park, other pet owners keep away and I don't have to worry about my dog beingaggressive, I just don't want her to get attacked.      Should I chance it or stay clear?

20090205074105AAzPQcV	Pets;Horses	How much does your farrier charge?	I'm getting ready to buy my first horse, and I am well aware of, and prepared for all of the costs. However, I still can't figure out how much farrier bills generally are. I would prefer to keep my horse barefoot, but that depends on hoof health, obviously.   So, if you could just tell me how much your farrier charges for re-shoeing, and how much they charge for a barefoot trims, if you know. Also, how often do you have the farrier come out?   Thanks a lot!    btw, if you don't actually have a farrier, but have a guesstimate on typical hoof-care costs, it would be much appreciated!

It then made a cacoon on the bottom of the box.. It has hatched into a moth. I can't get a good look at it because well its in a shoe box. It just looks like a moth. What should i feed it? I don't want to let it outside now because it snowing... can I let it out? Where do moths go in the winter? I don't even know if it can fly.. Because it did make its cacoon on the bottom of the box.. Hopefully his wings developed the right way...       So can i let him outside?      What should I feed him?

I can't get past having a stinky box of poop in my laundry room.  I clean it often, but I can still smell the urine, do you have to change the entire thing like every other day...change litter and all??  I can't stand the mess and smell.    Also...how do I get her to lose some weight?  I've got her on this weight management food, but it doesn't seem to be working.  She isn't pregnant, I've had her too long inside to know that.

Currently I am feeding them Purina kitten chow dry food and a special kitty wet food. I am finding they are using the litter box lots and it's very very stinky. They also seem hungary all the time. I am thinking of switching to maybe wellness for foods. I did notice it cost more but I guess I am wondering..if i go to a more expensive wet and dry food, could it balance out because they won't eat as much or as often because they will stay fuller longer? I live in Canada so brands available here would be helpful as well as any advice. Thanks!!

He is quite spooky but ive learnt to handle him since i got him in october. I am being trained by a proffessional and am going to move Sebby to the farm she lives at in the next few months(she is a family friend) so that she can help everyday instead of once a week. I am currently doing trotting and walking on a lunge and going on hacks. He is getting better every lesson i have with him but im worried about his polework.   He is ok going over them but sometimes if he kicks them he spooks and jumps sideways, i always stay on but it knocks my confidence so all i have done is walking over them. I have been doing groundwork since i got him, he only does it when im on him. Are their any techniques i can use. Im not a novice (riding for 10 years).I feel like ill never be able to jump him at this rate because he is too spooky and would proberably refuse it . Help me.!!!

I've seen a ton of horses that have been body clipped (all of them seem to be ridden English), and I was just wondering what the point of body clipping was.

Does anyone body clip their horses? and if so, why?

I tried Melafix (it doesn't work and I found out it's bad for bettas too!). Today I did a 100% water change with purified water, and I changed the filter. I added aquarium salt to the water before I put my fishie back in, and I added some Maracyn-Two a few minutes ago. I took out all the gravel and plants and so the tank has a bare bottom right now. Now that my fish is back in the tank, how long before I should start seeing some improvement to the fin rot?? I want to make sure the treatment is working. Also, how often should I be doing water changes/ how much water should I be changing while medicating?? I've never had to deal with fish disease before so this is a first so any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

For the next 20 minutes she was sitting there with her ears back and growling at me.  Every time he went to touch her, she tried to attack him.       She's a pretty mean cat and hates everyone.  She especially hates me and attacks me every time I walk past her. She's usually OK with him as long as he doesn't touch her.  I've been around for 3 years and she knows me but won't warm up to me.        We got scared last night and we were wondering if maybe she was hurt? Should we call the vet? Or was she just startled?

20090205040345AASpVha	Pets;Horses	If my mare turns out to be bred by her own baby will it have problems?	He is at the trainers and gotten cut. I have been very very ill this last year and wasn't able to devote the attention to them as I would have normally. I was in and out of the hospital and seeing specialists constantly and on meds and having seizures ETC. It was a rough time for me. So I wasn't intentionally ignoring the possibility of him breeding with her.I never actually saw her breed with him. But as I stated i was very ill and it still could have happened while we were on the waiting list for him to go to the trainers. She is not even showing so this is hypothetical at this point. But just in case I wanted some input. My mare is a registered palomino. Her entire line is inbred intentionally but not even close to mother and son. I would not have even remotely allowed this to happen intentionally. I hope she is not bred, but if she is I would want to keep it and take care of it. Hoping it wouldn't be deformed in any way. Does anyone have any experiences/advice in these type of situations?

20090205093654AA9f1ks	Pets;Dogs	Maintaining a Miniature Schnauzer Coat?	My gf has been looking into Miniature Schnauzers and while reading up on them saw that it is best for them to be stripped. i've heard about stripping but wasn't sure if it was really necessary for dogs that weren't showing.       she would prefer to keep it in a puppy cut but to do that it would require it be maintained regularly with trimmers and i wanted to make sure that wouldn't ruin it's coat because trimmers aren't anything like a stripping comb.       My rottie/shepherd, husky and pit don't require much grooming but I use small electric trimmers to maintain my yorkie's coat. I have been self grooming him for the last year and a half after he got jacked up at petsmart so she's leery of taking the dog to the groomer. and she would rather not spend the money if she can do it herself(although i'm sure she'll coerce me into at least helping out)      so is stripping mandatory for this breed whether it's showing or not? would keeping it in a puppy cut ruin it's coat? How would you properly maintain it's coat self grooming?

20090205074612AA1BMnF	Pets;Cats	HELP DRY CAT FOOD BAD?????????!!!!!!?	Ok im concerned. I was looking for a good quality dry cat food, and this is what People have said:       "The rise in the use of dry food has also seen the rise in diabetes.kidney disease, crystals ect in cats. Take it from someone whose cat got diabetes from eating dry food. I have also worked on a feline diabetes board and have seen literally more then hundreds of examples of what happens to the blood glucose when dry food is fed and when a switch is made. Dry food is NOT better for teeth, most are loaded with carbs and corn that cats may have trouble processing and 95% of the moisture is zapped out of the dry during processing. I can give you a million other reasons."      "Technically no dried food is good for cats or dogs...when they drink water it causes the food to expand in their stomach's so should be avoided"      Should i not feed my kitties Solid Gold, or Blue Buffalo Dry food then? What if i buy a cat water fountain to entice them to drink more? Is dry food really Bad?

20090205090602AAOqVSP	Pets;Dogs	Are there any Bichon Frise meet-ups or groups that meet regularly in New Jersey (preferably near Princeton)?	I have a 1 year old, almost 2, Bichon Frise.  I've been trying to get another dog to keep her company, since she has a large case of seperation anxiety.  However, since I am going away next year, it isn't likely that I will get another dog.  Therefore, I've been taking her to different dog parks, including Mercer County Dog Park and Rocky Top Dog Park.  She's made a lot of friends, but being a dog park, and with our busy lives, we don't really schedule a time when we will meet up.  We just go every couple of weeks and see who is there.      I need something more to help her anxiety.  I think that maybe a group of small dogs (or bichon frises) regularly meeting might help her.        Are there any small dog or bichon frise groups already started in the Princeton area?

20090205081255AAda7jC	Pets;Dogs	I need advice on my dog's eating habits?	I recently adopted an adult, house trained pitbull mix. I was told by the shelter that he was eating twice a day, and then going out to poop within the hour. I tried that, but he started pooping in the house almost immediately after his walks [only pooping, not peeing]. I reduced his feedings to once a day in the evenings (about two weeks ago), but he doesn't eat all of his food in one sitting, and he eats it very late at night when it's too late to take him for a walk.      evenings are best for long walks. my time in the mornings is limited, and i don't have a half hour to take him out [he takes his time to pee/poop]      how should i make sure he eats early enough to go out for walks and poop outside?  (should i only put the food down for a certain period of time? it concerns me if he doesn't eat though)      if he isn't eating as much as he should in one sitting, should I go back to feeding him twice per day?      thanks!
