Wni2A1nPaa	Ma quante stupidaggini.... E' vero che i baffi sono organi sensoriali, ma la parte sensibile  il cuscinetto carnoso da cui nascono (le "guancine"), non l'estremit! Un gatto con i baffi pi corti del normale non barcoller, non sar disorientato n tantomeno impazzir... Il massimo che pu succedere  che valuti male la larghezza di un buco e si ritrovi a non passarci col corpo, ma nemmeno ci si incastrer.  Finiamola con 'ste palle! E' bene non toccare i baffi perch la zona sensibile  MOLTO sensibile, chi soffre il solletico capisce cosa intendo, ma niente di pi!|`|cfTU7gLLaa	DA NON FARE MAI      Non dare latte.   Non dare carne cruda: i gatti ladorano, ma pu trasmettere malattie.   Mai tagliare i baffi. Il gatto perde il senso dellorientamento e della profondit. In un ambiente sconosciuto potrebbe anche impazzire.   Non fare mai asportare gli artigli.  dolorosissimo per lanimale perch si deve amputare la prima falange delle dita. Questo comporta uno strazio intollerabile che un amante degli animali non pu e non deve permettere. Il micio non potr pi difendersi n cacciare, perder fiducia in noi e cambier carattere.   Se ammalato, non usare medicine per umani. Consultare sempre un veterinario: certi farmaci (es. aspirina) per il gatto sono letali.   La nostra casa e il giardino sono il suo territorio: il gatto non accetter volentieri un ospite che non ha scelto. Se introduciamo in casa un altro animale, non obblighiamoli a fare amicizia subito. Mettiamoli vicini e lasciamoli soli. Qualche volta si azzufferanno; ma, dopo una settimana, saranno amici, oppure si ignoreranno cortesemente. Solo se avremo la sfortuna di trovare due gatti dominanti, saremo nei guai Ma questo accade di rado.   Mai abbandonarlo. Da generazioni il gatto domestico  abituato ad essere nutrito: da solo non sopravviverebbe, specialmente nelle nostre citt dove tutte le porte sono chiuse e i cassonetti dei rifiuti inaccessibili. Vagher fino a morire in qualche nascondiglio, se non avr la sfortuna di essere catturato e venduto ai laboratori di vivisezione, dove morirebbe fra atroci sofferenze.   Non picchiamolo mai. Se proprio deve essere punito, prendiamolo per la collottola e scrolliamolo parlandogli in tono duro. Teniamo presente che, in ogni caso, un animale deve essere punito sempre e solo quando viene colto sul fatto: in caso contrario non pu essere in grado di correlare la marachella con la punizione|`|qTkwmvcwaa	non ci tentare!!!   un gatto non la tua cavia personale   lascialo\a stare    come se ti togliessero il cervello  poi non cammini no!|`|7431JEjKaa	 meglio non tagliarli ma ti asscuro ke non perde l'orientamento!!|`|3RLNohjyaa	Oddio, riuscir lo stesso a camminare, ma perder il senso dell'orientamento e della profondit.

Sono per cos dire dei sensori. Non  assolutamente vero che non riesce pi a camminare, ma avendo meno il senso dell'equilibrio,  pi facile che si trovi in difficolt se si arrampica su un albero o se cammina su un cornicione.

Oltre tutto  una specie dotata di spiccato equilibrio, ci vuol altro perch barcolli.....|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	in verit loro usano i baffi come le vibrisse dei topi, quindi avrebbero difficolt a percepire spazi e quindi problemi di equilibrio.|`|0c9c09b824639734865833f3b48bfb8eaa	 come se tagliassero a te le orecchie..|`|LShRo6KGaa	Non  proprio cos, ma  vero che i gatti devono molto ai loro baffi se hanno un equilibrio incredibile. I baffi, come certi peli presenti nelle orecchie, nelle zampe, sono veri e propri ricettori. Mia zia aveva un gattino cieco... Pensa che riusciva ad orientarsi grazie ai baffetti. E conosco tantissime storie simili. Grazie ai baffi riescono a percepire quando c' il vuoto davanti a loro, se c' un ostacolo prima di sbatterci contro. Quindi comunque, essendo abituati ad usare questi sensori  difficile per loro farne a meno!|`|WwFrqJF5aa	non so se non riesce piu' a camminare pero' so che non si deve fare perche' per loro l'olfatto e' tutto e se gli tagli i baffi perdono il loro equilibrio

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Here, try this:  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/search.htm    It is a test you can take to see what kind of dog is best for you, based on your lifestyle and preferences and ability to care for a dog.     Both border collies and cattle dogs are very intelligent, "busy" sort of dogs that were bred for work and NEED something to do. They will not be content laying around in the yard like a golden retriever will. If you don't give them enough stimulation, they will invent their own ways to keep themselves busy, such as digging holes in the yard or chewing up things they are not supposed to. I just wanted to point that out because you stated you didnt want something too hyper like a Jack Russell, but both border collies and queensland's can seem "hyper" to a person not prepared for the high energy level they have. They are both excellent pets, just not for someone who is not willing to spend a lot of time with them.     If you have an animal shelter near where you live, I'd suggest you try there as well. There are always great dogs there that are homeless and would make an excellent pet. Often times a hybrid or "mutt" dog will be one of the best dogs you could ever have, and are much cheaper and easier to come by than purebred dogs.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	Boston Terrier  Any Spaniel  Labrador Retriever  German Shepherd  West Highland White Terrier  Schnauzer (Standard or mini)  Beagle  Bichon Fris  Irish Setter  Poodle|`|NlvghuIkaa	Keep notes here. All puppies are cute. Just as all kittens are cute, even as all babies are cute.. well, to certain extents but you get the point. It sounds to me like you are looking for a dog in medium size  am I right? Though you want a dog who is well behaved and easy trained when it comes to ducks and other birds? You can forget most of your pointers, spaniels and other retrievers in this case. Sorry first poster.. but with owning a Springer you should know that comes first.    Have you considered the Australian Kelpie? Seeing as you are very fond of the Border Collie but would like something that little bit different, well mannered and not too much fluff and stuff.. the Kelpie makes for an excellent family choice.

gU34xa9vaa	Yes I do and so do many more of us who intend to get it banned worldwide. It's banned in many countries because its classed as animal abuse and that's exactly what it is ! I expect you must have read all about it as you are so against it,GOOD ON YOU !! I wish the people who think it's acceptable would read up on it and if they still go ahead, they should first be prepared to suffer themselves the  physical and mental torment which declawed cats suffer ,before putting their cat through it !  The old chestnut that it's to protect babies and children from being scratched, doesn't wash any more does it, as in countries where it's banned, our children are brought up to treat animals properly and respect them as they come, not to expect them to be adapted so they can't defend themselves..As for furniture etc being scratched, so what, if people value their possessions more than their cats welfare, they shouldn't have a cat ! And there ARE alternatives to declawing!   THANK YOU Rose for bringing this up.|`|huEWXxmLaa	Yes Rose I do too.I'm doing research and a write up on it and I've hardly slept since I found out the truth about it.How anyone can put a cat through it I just don't understand.To a cat, its claws are the very centre of its health and happiness, they need them to be a cat !! Reading the true stories about the pain they suffer and the things that can go wrong and the number that end up in rescue shelters,most unrehomable, just breaks my heart.How can anyone have it done ? How can any vet do it ? How can the assistant stand and hold up a cat's paws to have the amputations done toe by toe ? It beats me. They sure must be a different breed to us who would  never  be any part of the cruelty of it.|`|E4ib2SeGaa	Hate it! Hate it! I despise it!  It is akin to having your toes cut off at the knuckle, it is not the same as nail trimming, which far too many people think it is.  I am sure there will be many contributors who will agree with me, and also some poor deluded souls who say it saves their furniture.  to all of them I say this, the clue to the use of furniture is in the spelling FURniture, get it.  Paws need claws - leave them be!|`|G032Flc3aa	I hate it with a passion and I also hate the owners who choose to put their cats through this misery, making lame excuses like "the cat scratches my kids" or "the cat scratches my furniture", the kids should be properly supervised, a cat won't scratch unless it is defending itself or struggling if it has been picked up roughly, and as for furniture so what?? Are a few sticks of furniture worth crippling a cat mentally and physically for life?    Those who think it's acceptable had better get used to the idea that it will soon be banned in the USA!|`|R2aTEi9Kaa	Yes, I absolutely hate and loath the procedure....I love my cats and would never mutilate them no matter what.     I hope one day we can get this horrible and cruel procedure outlawed throughout the world.|`|hhEb9fhXaa	hate not strong enuf word it makes me rage inside and want to chop off fingers and toes without knocking out first see how that feels i really could do damage to declawers no problems|`|YRTYXfggaa	I don't think it's a matter of hating or liking.  It's a matter of survival.  Some cats can cause havoc to furniture or scratching small children, resulting in either declawing or getting rid of the cat.  A cage in a shelter is just as inhumane, in my opinion, and if the cat doesn't get adopted, it could mean getting euthanized.  So, for those of us who can't rescue every abandoned cat out there because it clawed the furniture... if the last resort is declawing, I support it.|`|zzPjs02Uaa	yes.. i feel you can trim but don't take away something they might need to defend themselves if they get out the house!!|`|c4dny3nfaa	Yes man, I HATE it with a passion !! The sooner it's banned the better as the people who have it done are too thick to train their cats to scratching posts and their kids not to maul the poor things. Cats don't scratch for no reason.As for the reply that its better to be declawed than in a shelter ...hello..where have you been that you don't know that many cats in shelters ARE declawed, many develop biting problems,or  litter tray problems, or turn extremely nervous, then the selfish people who did that cruel thing to them, don't want them anyway !!! Man,I'd rather have my own fingers chopped off than do it to one of my cats.|`|YXvfV7Ulaa	I'm of the mind that if you are wanting a cat then you are agreeing to take on a small ball of mad fluff with sharp claws that WILL destroy parts of your furniture or house so why have a cat? you don't remove a dogs teeth when it chews up your slippers or best shoes or coat, its a rough analogy but you get my point. I love my cats to be cats, climbing tree's clawing my leg and bringing home mice, the clawing my leg isn't so great actually but I wouldn't have it any other way. I have found in the past that a shot from a water spray will deter them from any area's you want to keep in one piece. Cats can be trained like any other animal. People who de-claw their cats unfortunately can't be bothered to spend time and train them and only want the cat for show, to my mind anyway.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I volunteer at an animal shelter and there have been quite a number of owner surrenders of declawed cats. they can't take the behavioral problems that they have developed after being declawed.    I think it should be banned in the US like most of the rest of the world.  we are so behind the times here with that.    I think anyone who declaws their cat should be arrested for animal cruelty.  because it is very cruel and this does not benefit the cat at all it just causes a lifetime of pain and suffering because of it.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes! It is cruel and unnecessary!|`|L9MDzufnaa	I dunno. Never been declawed.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	if you are referring to cat declawing. cats that get declawed will sometimes start biting while playing. they feel vulnerable without the claws.|`|IuYekkPVaa	I'm pleased to say that declawing is illegal where I live because the law classes it as an "unnecessary mutilation".  I only wish that it were illegal everywhere.    No genuine animal lover would ever consider it acceptable to amputate the end of their pet's toes.|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi Rose,    Your statement about hating declaw surgery for cats is gaining steam throughout the U.S. Banned in many European countries, and other areas in the world, it is high time that the U.S. follows suit and also bans this barbaric practice.     Not only is it a cruel and inhumane surgery, with recovery that is painful and can result in disfiguring side effects, cats need their claws. That is why God gave them to the cat.    Even indoor kitties  may escape out the front door, so are vulnerable to attacks from other animals. Declawing removes a first line means of defense for them.    I adopted a cat that had been declawed prior to our adopting her, many years ago. While she could not scratch furniture, she had developed a habit of chewing on everything, leaving little toothmarks in lampshades, window shades and other items in our home. I think that "scratching" instinct which remains inherent, must be rather frustrating for them. without claws. She also chewed on nylon, and wool, which I suspect was in reaction to losing her claws.    As you know, cats can be trained not to maul furniture, if provided with appropriate scratching implements, that are high enough or long enough for them to stretch out completely, and if patient and consistent work with the cat is done, all cats can eventually learn to leave furniture alone. My couches and carpets are in pristine condition and we have two very active outgoing cats, with all claws intact. They do their "work" on their scratching posts and other devices for that purpose, liberally placed around the house.    I suspect that many folks are not aware that  "declawing",  is not  just removing the nails, or to the extent of the surgery. I wonder just how many veterinarians take the time to educate their clients about alternatives as claws are not only essential to climbing, but, they are mainly used for balance and for stretching the muscles in their legs, back and shoulders. Declaw surgery is often offered as "package deal"  with neutering/spaying ,in many clinics. It is a simple to learn to trim claws, and products like "soft paws" are excellent alternatives.    Thanks for helping to get the word out. I have noticed in the highly emotional declaw questions lately, that many people who were considering declawing have taken the advice by caring cat people, used alternatives, and have excellent results.    Hope this helps!  Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Freelance writer/blogger for   http://www.petside.com/the-sidewalk/|`|cTvP6j7Haa	I hate cats, period.  But declawing is just cruel.

AA11589437	Just make sure he doesn't manage to get out of the car, he will panic and run away.  Also, I find it comforting for my cat to hold his vcarrier or him when we ride the car, he feels safer.  And we have his litterbox with us, so when he needs to pee he meows and we get him out of the carrier and he can use his litterbox.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Start with letting him explore the car while it's not moving.  Put it in a garage, open the car doors, and let him explore.  Then, graduate to taking small trips around the block.  Make sure someone is there with him to calm him while another person drives.  Distract him with toys and treats.  Eventually, it won't bother him!  My cat loves car rides!  He sits on the center consel and looks out the window!|`|uD65ncljaa	I found that practice makes perrrfect, lol.  He was flustered the first few times, but got used of it.  Now he stands on my lap and looks out the window the entire time.

If allowed to roam, it could end up under the driver's feet or in an accident the momentum would send it flying and he could be seriously hurt.    I started by leaving my carrier on the floor with a pad covered by a t-shirt I'd worn.  The cat started playing in it, even taking naps there too.  Then I'd put the cat in the carrier, take her out to the car, sit in the back seat for a minute and bring her into the house and let her out of the carrier.  This moves along at the cat's pace, depending on how it reacts but gradually I was able to increase the amount of time we stayed in the car.  Then I began starting the engine and sitting there for a bit and as the cat was comfortable with that, I took short trips around the block.  I took her to a quiet pet store so we got out of the car then back in and home.      My cat is now a great traveler.  She doesn't associate the car trips with going to the vet.  I take her to VT in the summer, a 3hr ride, and she just curls up and sleeps.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Kaarhart said much the same as what I was going to say.

If you feel like you have to wash them off all the time buy some baby shampoo, it will be gentle on the horse.     They could be from bug bites. I'm not really sure what it is, most likely it really is just dirt. you could always keep him sheeted and put fly boots and mask on him. But that is a bit extreme. I figure don't worry about them till you have to give him a bath and them use whitening shampoo such as Silverado, White 'n Brite, Bluewash, Cowboy Magic Yellow out, and so on to remove the stain off a light colored horse.|`|rsp33Aysaa	I just bought a new mare who had something like that, right on the spot between her nostrils (she has a blaze, so it was white fur/pink skin there) and she's really sensitive about having her nose rubbed.

IrdZKYT3aa	Beware of the Chinese algae eater.  They can reach 8 inches in length, and the bigger they get the meaner and more territorial they become.  As they get larger, they also eat less algae and more protein.  They may become a danger to the frogs.    I'd look into dwarf plecos instead, like a rubbernose.  They get about 5 inches, big enough to defend it's self but not large enough to be a problem or hurt the frogs.  Best of Luck!
8GDd6lrnaa	yes go get them. i raised on that had fell out of our tree. they had to many. they like raw meat. cheap cuts of beef best little to no fat. no ground beef to fat. room temp. pound it out alittle or chew it alittle if your up to it, it's been 6 yrs. since i released him . he leave to raise is babies about 2 miles away. comes back stays near the house in winter. males have grey wings and females cinnamon. good book to read is the bird hospital. good luck. of course if you can't take care of them find a wildlife shelter.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	If they're still there, I would call a local wildlife refuge and get them to help.  They usually have all the appropriate licenses and there's usually an experienced rescuer/rehabber. Not to say that you couldn't do it, but the rescuers are already equipped.   Most people would drive on by and forget about them--I commend your concern.|`|mE1HSVTsaa	i think if they are still both there and alone take them to a wildlife centre who is better equipped and more experienced to look after them. If they where lying on the ground though i have to be skeptical that they could still be there. Sorry! But its nice that you are so concerened!!!

7be42b69f2b9dd61df940310f2d2e055aa	I am going to have to go with Mud Puppy on this one. Strictly on size, it is to big to be a younger or a Larval Tiger Salamander. does he have lung capacity at all? If not, with the size and other descriptions, I would say you have yourself a Mud Puppy. A picture would help greatly.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	tiger salamander larva can get up to 9 inches big so it could be one mud puppies look quite different to tiger salamander larva have u got a piccy but i would guess either an axololt or a tiger salamander larva|`|McnuekTBaa	Based on your description, it's a tiger salamander. I have never seen a mudpuppy in a bait shop (although they are sometimes used as bait), but have seen lots of tiger salamanders.  The "lines" you describe are the coastal grooves. Mudpuppies have them too, but they are not obvious.  Mudpuppies are almost always chocolate brown, with no green or gray, and they have a flattened appearance. They also hide under rocks almost constantly, whereas the tiger salamander will just sort of lay around in the open. And there's the obvious toe count, which you've figured out.
SrMt01nOaa	I think you should call a veterinarian. He/she would be able to help you best, especially if you take it in.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	You said he was already on meds for his eyes.  Did they come from a vet or just something you picked up?  If they came from a vet and as you say they are doing nothing I would take him back to the vet and tell him the whole story and see what he says. Stop back and think if he was acting and looking as he is now before you started these meds. Could it be that he has had some sort of reaction to them? Regardless I think if he were mine I would have already taken him,  I have 2 in the same enclosure and they get along fine but both have their own hides. I think again that I would be very careful in putting an older one with a younger one and is one of these the sick one?  If it is I would definitely not try it.|`|2JGSrYJ5aa	Is this gecko store bought or did someone give it to you, because if someone gave the gecko to you it might be a wild gecko and for some reason which is unclear to me wild lizards don't eat in captivity, and the bad part is once the gecko is set loose they do not go far and they still do not eat and (I'm sorry to say) usually die after a few days.   Now if it is store bought the gecko may have an internal fungus which (I am also sorry to say) is also incurable.  Now if the second question is related to the first, geckos are territorial and the stronger one might be intimidating the weaker one even if it does not show (i.e. beating the weaker one, taking its food.) that might also be a reason why the gecko is not doing much.|`|Bab96O8Gaa	Hi,  What substrate do you keep him on? You say this is the third time this has happened? Does he eat after the few months? This sounds to me like impaction which can be caused by the gecko eating sand to supplement calcium intake.  I would put the gecko on newspaper straight away and check his underside for swelling or discolouring.      As to your second question, it depends on sex.  Two male geckos definately will not live together, two females will be fine, and two females to one male will also be fine in a large enough enclosure.  Feel free to email me if you need any more help.  regards,  Tom  tom@justanotherpetshop.com

FNgSWEhNaa	Most cichlids are sexed using one method, their dorsal and/or anal fins. The male's is pointed while the female is rather rounded. In most species of cichlids, or any fish for that matter, in a group of same age healthy males and females, the females are usually larger and bulkier. Only a couple of methods I know that don't involve breeding, which is another topic.
bFzu835Aaa	If you don't keep them clean they can stink, just like anything else. Aquariums are HORRIBLE enclosures for hedgehogs, a nice guinea pig or rabbit cage (wire with solid bottom) is much better, I hardly ever notice a smell from my hedgies cages even if I put off cleaning them for a day or 2.     They're not any harder to clean than any other small animal    They hardly make any noise at all. They do however have to have a wheel, if you don't invest in a good one, and keep the hedgie in your room, the wheel will keep you up, but not any actual noise from the hedgehog.    They're friendly if you handle them, but they're not affectionate like a dog or cat. They'll let you handle them, enjoy treats, but not cuddle or come to you when called or anything.     Check out http://www.hedgehogcentral.com for basic info, and to find a good breeder near you (they're not legal in all states so check that out too)|`|oN92aOUraa	Hi Annabell   I had a hedgehog and can say that there are not hard to keep clean but they are not friendly either.

4aAhEK9daa	He shouldn't.  But I'm not sure why you seem so surprised?  Kittens can reach sexual maturity as early as FOUR months.  I do hope you haven't allowed him to run around unaltered outdoors or he already may have fathered a litter or two.    Kittens can be spayed as early as eight weeks as long as they're two pounds in weight and healthy.  As you can see it's pretty foolish till six months - like some behind-the-times vets still recommend!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	More then likely no he won't continue to spray.  If he was older and in the habit of spraying, you could have a problem.    Keep him confined to a room where you can clean easily and watch him for a few weeks.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Generally once they are fixed they stop that habit, but remember it will take a good two weeks for all those male hormones to leave his system.  Each cat is different, and will become sexually mature at a different age.  It's not uncommon for a 6 month old to reach that maturity.   That's why so many rescues and shelters advocate early spay/neuter - it's never an issue when they are neutered young, but so many vets still cling to that 6 months of age being some sort of magic age.  But he's neutered now, and that's the important thing.     In any case, get yourself a gallon of an enzymatic cleaner like Nature's Miracle or Simple Solution.  Thoroughly saturate any of the areas that he's sprayed, and repeat in a couple of days (the trick to all of these cleaners is to cover the entire area, and to be generous).  This will get rid of any of the smells that may be tempting him to go back and mark them again.|`|isF1nhVfaa	He still has the ability to do so, just not the drive (he just got it surgically removed). I don't have any exact statistics for you, but I'm assuming that a great majority of neutered males will stop. Though, I wouldn't be suprised if you caught him again.    Ask your vet or perhaps a pet store associate about products that can deter this!|`|hGY08GjRaa	Well,  it's definitely safer to fix them BEFORE they start the habit, but I understand your situation    However, if  he hasn't been spraying long, chance are the neutering will make him stop. It doesn't always work once it's a firmly established habit, but alot  of times it works.    Another thing you need to do that will really help, is to get some (however expensive) chemicals that are guaranteed to get out cat urine odor, and scrub the daylights out of whereverr he sprayed.. Get the smell out, or he may be led to keep spraying in that area..    Good luck..
EdN7fkTgaa	It's 100% normal! I have 2 cats and they also meow really loudly at night amd its driving my FAMILY insane tooo!When  cats meow at us they are usually trying to tell us that they want something, like "open the door, Im hungry or hey! Look at me, I want a tickle.    Many of the cat meowing sounds they make at us are variations of the mother to kitten chirping sounds. This is because cats see us not as leaders of the pack like dogs but as a mother figure.     They depend on us for food and comfort and so they behave like kittens around us.     Cats who spend a lot of time around other cats will use a different vocabulary made up of body language, scent, and other forms of cat communication. They mainly vocalise with each other at time of mating ie caterwauling and between mother and kitten.     Cats sounds can be broken down into three broad groups.   Murmurs: made with the mouth closed.   Vowel patterns: made as the mouth is closing ie meow.   Loud intense sounds: made with the mouth open.   Within these groups there are many different cat meowing sounds, some very subtle which we may not naturally pick up on but the kitten or sexual partner will.   There are general sounds that most cat owners will recognise and broadly speaking their meanings are the same, these are:     The general Meow - attention seeking used to communicate with owners or with kittens.     The Chatter  excitement or frustration, often seen when they are looking at birds through a window and cant get at them. (involves rapid jaw movements).     The Growl - warns others to stay away.     The Mew (of kittens)  used to attract mothers attention usually when they are hungry or cold.     The Hiss  is used as a threat to other cats usually, can also be a sign of fear.     The Caterwaul  used when looking for a mate.     The Purr  a sign of contentment and relaxation, but also used to comfort itself if in pain.     The Scream  used when in pain or distressed, dont tread on that tail again!     The Chirrup  this is a friendly sound, often used to greet other cats or their owners.  Excessive cat meowing is often caused because the cat has learnt that this gets them what they want, a bit like a child who learns to cry when they want something.     This can become a bit of a habit and the cat starts to do it more and more. Usually this can be quite cute, however if it starts to happen all night long or is driving you crazy during the day, then its time to break the habit.     The first step is to ignore their cries. They are used to getting what they want when they meow, so only give them their food etc when they are quiet. Follow this up with lots of attention when they are quiet and none when they are noisy.     Do not shout or scold your pet when cat meowing because they are trying to get you to do something and they see this as attention, which is GOOD.                If this cat behavoir persists then you may have to resort to squirting a little water at them when they are noisy.     This does not hurt them and they soon learn that being noisy equals a water shower and stop the excessive cat meowing. This can be particularly useful for cats that meow throughout the night for attention.    Remember to still give them lots of cuddles and play, perhaps just before bedtime.       When we first brought Mo home, she wouldn't stop meowing and stuck to us like glue which was ok except that we kept falling over her. We were at our wits end when we discovered a clever little trick.    If we blew in her face, just the once, she would stop her meowing at once and go and sit on her cushion. It was like magic. It still works when she is being a little annoying. Why not give it a try with your cat the next time they are misbehaving|`|PSWFAVthaa	Keep him awake during the  day as much as possibly, ware him out with games. Soon he'll get into a pattern|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	I am in the same boat our cats will be 1. They seem to want to wake up and pretend they are shutting the closet, bathroom and bedroom door - then jump around - I can't lock them out they will cry and jump and if I put them in the mud room it's to cold for them.

Cats sleep 16-18 hours in a day and just by nature are active during the night. Try hanging a toy from a door frame away from your room, something to keep him occupied while you're sleeping.    What I did when I saw my cat napping during the day...  Pushed him off the couch!

Is he a indoor or can he go outside? i let kitten go outside that way he runs and plays when i go to bed he is a sleep.  Hope this helps:)|`|AA12123428	You can't; cats are nocturnal. That means they get active at night.    Your cat needs feline company at night. Fit a cat flap, leave some water both inside and outside and get some cat toys.|`|km5e0hfsaa	cats are night time animals so good luck with that|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Cats are naturally nocturnal. They like to sleep all day, storing up their energy, and then release it at night by doing all sorts of things to keep you awake. I have noticed that it helps if you try not to let them sleep a lot during the day. Whenever you catch the cat sleeping excessively, wake him up. Find something for him to play with, and wear him out making him chase a feather toy or laser pointer. Make him spend that energy during the day. This really does help.

RoPLmd2daa	If you're talking about Howrse, every horse has its limits as to how high its skills can go, because of their pedigree. The only way to really get the highest skills possible is to play with the foals as much as you can to increase their potential (which is still going to be limited by their bloodlines). So buy a horse with really high skills so you can breed them to make more higher-skilled horses.|`|4trciAwvaa	Rephrase you question, no one has a clue what your on about?|`|4627db3161084bce021d06067966d9f0aa	ha ha ha  thanks for the laugh|`|cSqx1DxKaa	....?

Sorry, I'm not a vet. Maybe you should go put the poor thing out of its misery, and refrain from having any more pets. Imagine being locked in a cage with no toilet for three months! You'd have a freaking pink lump growing on your eye too!     Neglect is animal cruelty. You don't deserve to be a pet owner, and neither does your mother. Shame on both of you.|`|2x2LYkj4aa	do not wait.     take it to the emergency vet NOW!!! it could be an infection, or a tumor, or something else. we dont know. a vet will. also, if you got it from petsmart or petco..... well they dont have very good reps..... and it is your fault since you forgot to clean its cage.|`|u61yKsE3aa	You need to find a vet that will see it.  If it's a tumor they can either remove it or put hiim out of his misery if it's inoperable.  I have a feeling that it is not a tumor though and instead is an infection due to neglect.  If this is the case a vet will need to prescribe antibiotics.  How old are you?  As an animal owner it is your responsibility toa care for any pet you have this means not only food and water but husbandry and medical care as well.  THis responsibility falls on you, and if you are a minor you mom as well.  If you chose not to clean his cage for 3 months you are guilty of animal cruelty.  If your mom witnessed this and did not rectify the situation then she is guilty of not only animal cruelty, but also failing to teach your children responsibility.  Both of you need to take a good hard look in the mirror and then you need to get this hamster the medical care he needs.  A pet store in your area will be able  to get you in contact with the vet they use.  Do the right thing for this poor neglected animal and take him to a vet.

Yu7y6yfraa	First, I would like to commend you for knowing that chocolate cookies are not good for dogs and taking quick action.  It was much smarter to keep the chocolate away from the dog than to risk the vaccine from coming back out.  Vaccines can be redone.    No, you do not need to get another vaccination.  The serum is injected into the tissue or muscle and is quickly absorbed.  Most vets massage the area to get the vaccine into circulation even quicker.     You did good.  It is time for you to stop worrying.|`|cqLYkuz8aa	To correct some of the above answers: vaccines are not injected intravenously (into the blood stream). They are either injected subcutaneously (into the tissue below the skin) or intramuscularly (into the muscle).    To answer the original question: The vaccine did not come out when you grabbed your dog, and does not have to be re-done. Your brother is just messing with you. Depending on how old you dog is, he may still need booster shots sometime in the future. Ask your veterinarian if you have any questions about vaccination schedules.|`|AA11305153	Do you honestly think that a liquid came come out of a tiny pin prick surrounded by fur?    First of all, the serum is injected directly into tissue that is meant to hold liquid.  The serum then immediately after being injected was shot into the blood stream and circulated around your animals body.  so unless you have completely opened your dog up and drained his blood, NO.  The injection will not leak out and NO you do not need to get him re-injected.  That would kill him.|`|03d9ce75ca137947c964e4a217ef71c4aa	The vaccine should be dispersed enough that he will be just fine ... when i vaccinate my pups ... I rub the vaccinated area to make sure  the vaccine goes  into their systems ... ... Don't worry he is going to be ok|`|XWMfdjdnaa	No, a shot is injected into the blood stream. you cant just squeeze it out. Im not sure but i think he would probably get very ill or die if he was vaccinated again so soon.|`|fd645fb2d6b288179b1f046acb38d3ddaa	if the vet did it right, the vaccine would've been in his bloodstream the moment your puppy was injected. shouldn't be a problem, nothing will come out of where you pinched him. he yelped only cos the injection still stings i guess. but of course, if it swells up or you notice anything wrong with the point of entry (or where you accidentally pinched him), then go to the vet!     i do hope your puppy will be fine!|`|DE2Q85v9aa	As long as there is no blood coming, it's fine. And say if it is even then you dont need to vaccinate him again.    Just relax.  Good luck|`|5412173baed2a21884761c1f6bde287baa	I gotta say, I think it's sweet that you're worried about this.     You should be fine. The dog won't even remember. Give him a treat and some rump scratching and everything will be a-ok.|`|L6C66lAJaa	No your dog will be fine, and for future reference, yes chocolate is bad for dogs, but a chocolate chip will not hurt your dog.So there is no need to yank him back that way next time. It goes based on the size of the dog, but for instance a 10 pound dog would have to eat 1 1/2 pound of chocolate for it to make a difference. Good looking out for your dog though. He should be fine. Good luck.|`|sxImRCT5aa	go DOCTORS and maybe put ice on it and i hope you like my message good luck for ya dog :(|`|EeJMITyCaa	No the vacination won't come out of his shoulder. The vaccination site has already healed enough so that blood and the vaccine can't come out. Also, the vaccine runs through the blood. It's not like it's just sitting in one spot. If anything blood would come not the vaccine.|`|uIvb5eqoaa	I think you may be over reacting.  I highly doubt you pinched your pup hard enough to break the skin and for any fluids to come out.  Even if you did, I doubt the fluid injected at that site would still be there.  I warn you though, that is you over -react to your dog, you are sending out a nervous energy that your pup will pick up on.  He will grow into an anxious dog and that leads to obbessive compulsive bahaviors, seperation anxiety, and loads of fun, expensive behavior problems.  Your dog is a dog.  If you treat it like a sickly child, you won't have a mentally healthy dog.  Also, while letting dogs eating chocolate is very bad, your dog is probably not even going to get sick if he eats one chocolate chip.  I don't advise giving him chocolate, but even if he is a tiny Yorkie or Chi, one chip won't do anything, unless if he already is VERY sick.  Grapes and raisins are different and your dog should not have even one, but you don't need to freak about a single chocolate chip.      Lastly, just because your dog yelped, doesn't mean you hurt him or did something bad.  If you watch puppies play, they yelp all the time.  It doesn't mean, you are hurting me.  It usually means either, wow you suprised me', or 'ok this is getting too rough for me so go more gentley.  It's not as if they are saying, 'dear lord, you just ripped my limb off, I'm in terrible pain!'  You should not be afraid to grab your pup if it is too protect him or to reinforce you are the pack leader.  That said, don't beat your dog or do anything with the pure intention of hurting it.  But it's  a dog.  They can play and rough house.  It's not a ming vase.  I hope this helps you.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Don't worry.  The vaccine has been absorbed by the body at this point.  Don't get another vaccination--many vaccines use live viruses, bacteria, etc in small or weakened forms to allow the immune system to build up immunities or resistances to the disease/illness.  Over vaccination can make your puppy very very sick and could be lethal.    He just yelped because his shoulders were a bit sore from the shot.  It's better you grabbed him away from that chocolate, so you did the right thing in the situation (though no one likes hearing a puppy cry or yelp).    Keep doing what you're doing.  You're taking the time to ask questions that you have and, in doing so, being a responsible pet owner.  Your veterinarian should also be willing to answer questions like this over the phone, if you wanted to give him/her a call.  I've done that many times with my first adopted dog.  A good vet will answer simple questions on the phone and not require you to make an appointment every time something comes up (costing you to spend unnecessary money).

gUsJlTvKaa	Defently do a small water change of about 1/4 of the tank and keep the heat up in there. But if you cant see any problems with him that you can treat then most likely he will die.   When you see Dwarf Gouramis get sick and you have other fish in the tank its a pretty good indication that something is going wrong in the tank so you can be prepared to fix it before the other fish become sick. Dwarf Gouramis will always be the fist fish before any others to become sick in your tank.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	at this point let it roll, unfortuantley at this point its about 90% chance he will die.      find out why he's like this is important so it doesn't happen to other fish.    A small water change (10-15%)of exactly the same temp water may help and keep the tank lights out aswell.        good luck!!!|`|Zzr5FbVFaa	dude call the vet
jpqt4KEhaa	Actually you are right you are not allowed to have any kind of boot of leg wrap on a horse in the NATRC. I have competed in these events and if your horses feet are conditioned meaning that you ride often on gravel and other variable footing, you should be fine. If you compete in the novice division you are usually only riding your horse one day. I would do that to start with and see how you like it and how the feet hold up. Oh and I believe that they are not allowed leg wraps or boots because the goal is to prove that the horse is a trail horse and that they do not need assistance and that you could hide lamness, injuries, or genral soreness with these things. Hope that helps.|`|FxJfzoFNaa	some competitive trail rides won't allow your horse on the trail barefoot  ,so call before you haul!!

Here is a site on competitive trail riding with many questions answered.  According to this, you can go barefoot or use hoof boots as long as they don't cover the coronary band.  The reasons for this are explained in the text..........    http://www.stctrailhorses.com/aboutNATRC...    This information is from the official NATRC website which is the national organization that sets the rules in the US.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	I haven't heard about the boot rule.  But in some areas it is impractical to try trail riding barefoot.  Here in the Ozarks of Missouri there is far too much flint and it wears the toughest hooves down to nubs in a short time.  I used to have my horses go barefoot all the time.  But when I got serious into trail riding that ceased to be an option.  500 miles a year is far too many miles to put on a barefoot horse when there is no place that is not rocky.    Since competitive trails are often 30 to 50 miles long you may wish to reconsider your stance for your horse's sake.|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	I'm a strong believer in keeping horses barefoot too. I've never heard of what your talking about. You should be able to compete with boots like....renegade boots, of easy boots. I'm pretty positive.
9KVmd9Hzaa	I agree with you...barefoot is the best way to go! Be sure that you get someone that knows how to trim a BAREFOOT horse....not a farrier. There is a big difference between a barefoot horse and someone just TRIMMING a horse. Make sure that your farrier or trimmer doesn't take any sole, that's BAD! Be sure to keep your horse off hard ground. Let them walk though to get good blood flow to their feet. It will take about a good week to get your horse to adjust. All horses are different and it depends on where you live. If you have boots...like renegade boot, or easy boots...those help immensely! Also a new barefoot horse's hoof tends to chip a LOT, so if you have a rasp I'd use it or learn to use it and just keep your horses hoof nice and smooth. Hope this helps.|`|XHHkBkwOaa	take the shoes off and put to rest in the paddock for atleast two months     you need to take work very lightly after the first two months no rocky ground grass is preferrable     after a few weeks when you have put him in the paddock let his feet grow out a bit more than usual dont wrry if it cracks a little    call the farrier and get him to trim his feet then and make sure you let him know that hes a horse thats freashly become a barefoot.    there is a different way you trim a bare footed horses feet to a horse who gets shoes on either regularly or every now again for showing certain things like that    it may take a few months for his hoof to be very tough and stable    its a huge process of drowing his feet out and trmming them accordingly    HAVE A CHAT TO YOUR FARRIER =)|`|suTye2m2aa	Weather or not a horse needs shoes or can barefoot depends on the horse. Not ALL horses should be barefoot, it depends on their hoofs. So I would suggest getting advice an experienced farrier.  A friend of mine has been so set on keeping her horse barefoot that he now has severe problems because of it, and the vet that came to give him chiropractic work was horrified that she refused to put shoes on him since it was messing up his back.     So it really depends on the horse. Please make sure you are doing what is best for the horse, not for you.    Hope I helped and best of luck!|`|NApGmuHdaa	Make sure that this choice is right for you horse - and that is something no one can tell you unless they physically see and check the horses hooves. It is also something that you may have to wait and find out and if it doesn't work out put the shoes back on. Talk to an experienced and trusted farrier and get him/her to come out and see the horse and tell you what is best. He/she will also give you advice on how to make the transition smooth and comfortable for your horse. If you are riding a lot on slippery grounds, roads or competing to a high level I would not recommend taking shoes off as that is usually why they need them. I have two ponies who are both barefoot and are happily competing at grande prix. So it does show you don't really need shoes on. Your horse will definitely be a bit ouchy when you first take his shoes off - it is like you wearing sneakers all of your life and then taking them off and walking on hard ground/rocks. It is exactly the same for your horse; and you will have to be patient with the transition. Try not to ride on hard ground after you have taken them off as you will end up with a very sore and grumpy horse. If you can ride in an arena where there is a softer surface  than just grass. Be careful and aware that it is a big change for him and you and make a conscious effort to make things more comfortable for him e.g. don't walk on roads or do things that put more stress on his legs and hooves such as jumping. This is just for the first few weeks, although it is different for every horse some do not feel any different and after about a week you can go back to light riding, others feel it a lot and you may need to put boots on until they are more used to the feel of no shoes, this is especially for those horses who have been with shoes for over 3 or 4 years.     Whilst changing I would recommend using a product for his hooves to make them harder such as one with biotin in it. You can probably talk to your farrier and he/her will recommend something. Also on the bottom of the hoof you may want to but something on such as cold tar; but again your farrier would be the best to help you there.     When you talk to your farrier about what to do tell he his previous history, how long he has had the shoes on for, what sort of riding you will do and your farrier will tell you whether he thinks it is a good idea to change to barefoot - what you do may be entirely different and you may want to get a few opinions before actually choosing.    To the matter of price: Yes of course barefoot is cheaper. In the summer we get our ponies done every four or five weeks as their hooves grow so quickly and it is better to get them done before they are absolutely awful. In New Zealand (at the New Zealand dollar) you can pay from about $35 - $100 including travel, it really depends on how much that farrier wants to charge.    I am not for either barefoot or shoeing, as I said I do have two ponies that compete happily barefoot - so you probably could say I was a little bit for it. But I do choose for the horse not for me or the price of shoeing. If it is best for the horse then that is what I shall do, no matter if I believe in it or not. Hope this helped!!|`|V962TU2taa	I prefer to shoe my horses but my current horse has feet hard enough to not really need them.  The transition wasn't really that hard.  Kept him on softer ground for a while and I also oil his hooves once a week which works really well.    When they have been trimmed I keep him of hard surfaces few a day or two but I do a lot of trail riding and he has no problem walking on roads.  But make sure you get a person that actually knows how to barefoot trim.  When my horse was done the first time by a supposed 'professional' she cut his hooves so short that he was standing like he had laminitis.  I was so angry!    But the woman who does them now is great.  You can actually learn to do it yourself.  There are usually courses around that teach you,maybe you could look into it if you prefer barefoot horses.  But his hooves look great, no cracks, he doesn't go sore and it suits him really well.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Both my horse are barefoot. I would make sure you found a great ferrier that knows something about bare feet. My farrier knows a lot and he is always telling me whats going on with my horses feet. I would say, take off the shoes, and make sure the horse has some dry soft ground to walk on for a while as it might be sore if its hard to too muddy. Dont do any riding during the week because it might cause him to become lame. If the hooves get dry, cracked, or chipped, use some  of this (http://www.healing-tree.com/T-Hoof.html) or I use another product that I just cant remember the name if but its like a glue substance and it works wonders!!! (you should be able to find it in any tack store). Boots might help, although ive never used them. I have to get my horses feet trimmed about every 8-10 weeks (they grow slowly) and it costs me $35 per horse for a trim. You might also want to keep a rasp around just to keep them nice and smooth (although I dont). Good Luck!|`|LOH6UVh7aa	NOT all horses need shoes!  That is determined by each horse.  All of mine(28) are barefoot. We ride in mountains of WY & NV. Both places are very rocky!!!  It will just take time for your horse to build strong hoof walls, which is done by taking the shoes off. If it was me & I bought a new horse with shoes. That is one of the 1st things I do is take them off. I have never had a horse that HAD to have shoes on. & For fuglys bolg- it is FULLLL of ill information. I never read any of hers!! NOOOO good!!!!  Go to a REAL site that knows what they are talking about. Please DO NOT use that as a reference!!!! NOT wise!!!!! It is much cheaper to have a barefoot horse over shoes. & Good for you barefoot is BEST!! It is how the horse should be. Here are a few  good sites to read.        http://www.thenakedhoof.com.au/      http://www.thehorseshoof.com/      http://www.tribeequus.com/    http://www.barefoothorse.com/barefoot_St...|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Most important is to find a good barefoot trimmer who knows how to maximize the proper function of the hoof, and keep your horse trimmed frequently enough.  The transition will progress in stages, and while that is happening some people purchase hoof boots for riding on hard surfaces.  It takes many months to undo the damage shoes do to the hoof.  The soles will need to form callous, and the wall tissue will have to thicken, which will happen with time.  Once the walls, frogs,  and heels are functioning correctly, the circulation and tissue perfusion inside of the hoof will be improved, which will in turn improve the whole hoof. Your horse can gradually develop sturdy, hard hooves that can handle any surface......even the weakest, thinnest walled hooves can be turned around if given the chance.  Here is an interesting article on some barefoot research findings................    http://www.thehorseshoof.com/Art_Bowker....    A certified barefoot trimmer will cost more than a regular farrier charges for the usual brand of trim, but it is worth the cost to have it done right.  ADD......it is not recommended that you use any hoof dressing, hardener, etc. on the barefoot hoof.  All of these  interfere with development of a healthy, rock hard hoof, and some do considerable harm.  And the more exercise you give your horse, the more the tissues are perfused with blood, which is necessary to the adaptation of the hooves.|`|px27V5N9aa	The best way is to get boots.  EZ boots or another type.  Keep those on him for awhile and then take them off while he's in his stall.  After a few weeks you can try him without boots in the pasture.    Normally if they've been in shoes most of their days they are severely ouchy (even in grass).  They will be ouchy on dirt roads for a very long time.  You'll need to ride in boots for awhile til he toughens up.    You can use Venice Turpentine to help toughen.    EDIT:  Hey GOOOD:  You are referring to a blog by someone that is not a certified farrier, commenting with her own bias, and the trim that is being discussed is the STRASSER.  That trim is barbaric and not used by normal day to day barefoot trimmers.  Don't put us all into one basket and you shouldn't be trying to scare people off of keeping their horse barefoot.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	You pull their shoes and trim their feet.  Their is no transition but their feet are usually tender the first few weeks.    Depending on your area you may be able to get by with going barefoot even with competitive trail that you are planning.  I just wanted you to be aware that being adamant and inflexible can lead to problems.Give it a try.  But be willing to do what is best for your horse even if it is getting shoes.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	When the shoes are pulled, the farrier should do a minor trim, basically just a little rasping on the toe and sides, not too much on the bottom.  Clean the sole and do not pare it or take off much frog.  He should take off a little more heel that if he was being re-shod.   The farrier should take off excess growth, but not as flat as being re-shod. It would be best to let the horse run barefoot at least a week before you ride, as long as he is showing no lameness.  Keep him off hard surfaces for awhile (pavement, rocks, gravel).  Sand would be great!  Many people are going barefoot horses nowadays, it is believed that it is more natural for the horse and does not cause damage that nails can cause, and it toughens the hoof.   I only shoe now when I go to  a major reining show, and use sliders for the protection of my horse.  Other than that, mine are all barefoot now.  I see no problems with barefoot, but I do think if a horse has a hoof problem, like founder or bad cracks etc, they may need shoes until it is corrected.    Farriers usually charge about half of what they charge for shoeing,  all depends on where you are from, some charge very little for just a trim.  Here's a couple of articles on it:  http://americashorsedaily.com/barefoot-t...  http://www.equinewellnessmagazine.com/m/...|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Regardless of what YOU think or what anyone on here thinks ultimately your horse's soundness will tell you whether they need shoes or not. Some horses need shoes. It's a sad fact of equine care that not every horse can be barefoot. A lot of horse breeds have crappy feet (Thoroughbreds are notorious) that once you pull their shoes the wall starts to crack, break, flake, etc. Instead of saying "I am going to shoe barefoot because I like it and it's cheaper" you should be saying "I would like to see how he does barefoot" and go from there.    I went from a horse with train wreck feet needing corrective shoes ($175 just for the front every 8 weeks) to a TB needing regular shoes ($110 every 6-7 weeks) and my next horse is going to be an Andalusian. Part of the appeal for me of that breed (along with being awesome, gorgeous and the "ultimate dressage horse") is that they have really good feet and can be barefoot. $50-$60 every 6-8 weeks.    In any case, you transition a horse to barefoot by having a farrier remove their shoes. Give them a couple of days, see how the hoof wall is doing, check on the soles of their feet and keep your eyes out for any type of lameness. A LITTLE soreness is okay at first, but should go away within a few days.    PLEASE if your horse is sore barefoot put shoes back on. Leaving a hrose that needs shoes barefoot and sore/lame is a form of animal cruelty and people HAVE been going to jail for this.    http://fuglyhorseoftheday.blogspot.com/s...       http://www.ilph.org/ukoperations_details...    I know you want what's best for your horse. Work with your horse and your farrier to figure out what that is instead of deciding without any of the facts.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	The best way to transition your horse to barefoot will depend on a few things 1)what type and condition of hooves he has 2)how long he's been in shoes 3)what type of ground he will work on 4)what type of ground he will live on 5)the time of year 6)how much you intend to ride him.  You would probably really benefit from watching Pete Ramey's DVDs on barefoot trimming, they are called "Under the Horse" I think. Those DVDs are a bit long, boring and dry but they will give you tons of advice on how to pick a farrier, what to watch for, how to transition him over, and even how to do some of your own trimming and maintance.  If you buy a horse now I would pull the shoes immediantely. If you buy a horse just as show season starts, you may want to leave the shoes on for a few months. A horse that has been in shoes for a long period of time is going to take a while to toughen up his shoes and frog, and will have to wear hoof boots. You are not allowed hoof boots in shows, so you'll end up with a tender or sore horse. If you can pull them now you have months before the beginning of show season and hopefully your horse will be ready to go by then.  Ideally your horse's living grounds will be similiar to the type of ground you're going to ride on. If this is the case, then he'll transition over fairly well. If you'll ride him on much different ground than his home ground, then things get tougher. Also, if your horse can be out in turnout 24/7 he'll toughen up quicker than if he's in a paddock or stall. It takes movement to grow a thicker sole and frog, and he won't change very quickly in a stall.  I bought four Easyboot Epics for my mare (off e-Bay, you can find the method to measure by going onto EasyBoots website) and used them most of this spring. This was the first year I did not shoe my horse for the summer, and she managed well. I did have to watch her carefully, showing wasn't a problem because arenas are normally soft and well worked, but the problem areas was the gravel around arenas and show pens. I tried to use the EasyBoots when we covered hard, rocky ground to prevent stone bruises. We showed on the Paint breed circuit and earned points in four different classes, including Western pleasure and Hunter under saddle, so obviously she still moved well without shoes!  As for farrier costs, this will vary enormously on where you live. In my area in Canada a trim costs $30, a full shoe is $90 and front shoes are $60. This is pretty reasonable compared to a more urban area. I have no barefoot trimmers within an hour or two of me. I pulled the shoes off my mare, and had my farrier trim her feet (but I did tell him I wanted to try her barefoot, and asked him to leave her sole and frog as intact as possible) I watched the Pete Ramey DVDs and learned how to put a mustang roll on my mare's hooves, and I did most of the trimming inbetween the farrier's visits. I went all last year with the farrier only trimming my horse's hooves three times, and I did it all the other times. By being careful and trimming small amounts frequently, and getting assistance from my farrier, it worked well. Believe me, my mare was NOT neglected and had no hoof problems. Not one person at the show, including judges, would have ever known that I did much of her trimming. The cost of the EpicBoots were about $60 apiece, I saved more in shoeing and trims than I paid for the boots.  I agree that each horse has different feet and not all will respond as well to barefoot trims. I do believe that if you learn what you're doing, monitor your horse's feet, use boots and even pads inside the boots if necessary, allow your horse in turnout as much as possible, and don't allow your horse to become grossly overweight and eat too much carboydrates the majority of horses, including Thoroughbreds, can go barefoot. Some may require boots for riding on hard ground part of the time, some will require boots for that sort of ground all their lives.
YLYAo2zmaa	Do not leave food down all the time for your dog. Feed her in the morning walk her Before and after. Make sure you walk her at bed time. Do not feed her after 6 pm. Teaching a dog to ring a bell to go out is very difficult, get her pottying outside first. Most beagles are not hard to train contrary to what has been said here. Crate your dog at night in a crate lined with puppy pads or newspaper, she will not want to potty where she sleeps. Take her to potty immediately upon taking her from the crate. It is going to take quite awhile to break these old habits.|`|y4Uliyq3aa	My Beagle just turned 7 Months yesterday and she does the same thing! She's be outside for 30 Minutes and then she comes Into the house and pees....so annoying! I honestly don't know what to tell you...besides I feel your frustration. I hope my beagle doesn't inside until she Is two!|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Point Number Two about Beagles: Yes, they are hard to housetrain. Everyone's heard the story about their friend's cute little Lab puppy that whined a couple of times the first night he came home, piddled on the carpet once, then never had an accident in the house again. I cannot stress enough: A Beagle is not that lab. The Beagle was NINE MONTHS OLD before he was reliably housetrained. He couldn't be trusted in the house uncrated by himself until we'd had him for the better part of a year. The entire house needed to be steam cleaned once we were done.    We're not quite certain why this was. Whether we were particularly useless housetrainers, or whether his hound's extra strong sense of smell made him more prone to peeing where he'd already peed on the carpet, or whether he was just a pain in the *** and didn't give a **** - unknown. But the bottom line was, he was really difficult to housetrain. And that's a story I've heard repeated from other Beagle owners. Maybe not 9 months, but not overnight either.    BEAGLES-Lots of incorrect info in BOTH books & Internet but here the shocking truth! Beagles are HIGHLY energetic BREED, who being a scent hound, shouldn't be let off- lead as THIS BREED would just follow scent-trails. They love to dig, bark and howl, they are stubburn and difficult to train, but do require intensive training!   a very common breed to be surrendered at shelters, so please research this breed before you decide to adopt. They require very tolerant owners! Not suitable with small animals. The Beagle is an all around happy dog that makes a wonderful companion.They are excellent with children and generally good with other dogs, however they require 4km daily walks!|`|EeJMITyCaa	If I were you I'd look in your area for a professional training camp. A training camp usually costs around 500 bucks for a low level camp where they teach your dog basic obidence and house break him. Of course they have higher levels too. If you want you can email me if you want advice on training techniques. It's hard to say if her failure is a result of your mistakes. For example her crate may be too big or maybe you just aren't releasing her enough.|`|C4AUC5vGaa	If you crate her in an appropriate size crate every night you at least wouldn't wake up to your house destroyed and surprises everywhere. Crates are easier to clean than the house.|`|hPhQkT79aa	What you do is you walk her about 4 times a day. Also if you feed her dry food, well, just stop. Feed her wet kind of food. And after that put ice cubes into her drinking bowl. You'll get use to it. After a few weeks or days she'll stop peeing in the house. I didn't tell that you need to wash your floor until the smells gone. I don't know how to do that but ..........
TkJn9gO0aa	A simple 20 gallon(tall) aquarium is the minimal size tank for an Amazon Tree Boa.    They are very easy snakes to take care of. Feed them mice once a week, but don't let them get too fat as they are naturally thin snakes.     Some of them are nippy, and bites from them are not pleasant. I recommend purchasing a snake hook to get the snake out of the cage.....once on a hook, they are easier to transition to your hands without getting nipped.    They LOVE humidity. So misting the tank a couple of times a day will help keep the humidity up. Also, using a substrate like Eco-Earth or Bed-A-Beast will do well at retaining the humidity. Often placing pieces of acrylic plexiglass over the screened lid of the cage will also aid in higher humidities.     There pretty simple to take care of..........I offer a large water bowl, but mine is never seen in it.     Heat should be applied via lamp, as they will not use belly temps through a heat mat.
7zifiisiaa	Try giving her a toy before you leave.  Like a Kong with peanut butter, but only give this to her when you're leaving, so that she associates you leaving as being a positive thing.      Also, randomly, I was watching an episode of "It's Me or the Dog" on Animal Planet and there was an episode about this.  I think it might be online if you want to watch it.|`|qlAbqkSkaa	My cocker spaniel ultimately got over his anxiety attacks (he did the same things), these are working breeds but that really doesn't mean anything when you know it's about them missing you.  What I did was, leave him for different intervals of time, until it progressed to the usual time I would be away for work. Also, turning the lamp/light on when I leave lets him know I will be back soon.|`|vxc0NwMSaa	Give her lots and lots of exercise--if you tire her out she won't have so much pent up anxiety.  I'm a total dog whisperer fan--you should check his videos and books out.|`|a3R8b2pXaa	Many episodes on "ITS ME OR THE DOG" on Animal Planet include anxiety, you should definitely check them out.        I LOVE HUSKIES    IM GONNA GET ONE|`|iojR7vVIaa	Don't worry. She won't have an anxiety or heart attack from excitement. Her anxiety might be fueled by you when you get home. You might feel guilty for leaving her. Do you start petting her right away and give her all kinds of attention when you get home? You may want to just ignore (no eye contact either) her for about 30 minutes or so. I know it sounds cruel, but I had high anxiety dogs and this works after a few weeks of conditioning. After ignoring her, take her out for some fun play or walk her. Give her a treat at that time when she is showing nice calm behavior. This is the behavior you want to reward.|`|XWMfdjdnaa	buy a kong and fill it with peanut butter to give her as you walk out the door. If you can give yourself a couple hours to train her that would be the best. Go through your routines before you leave. For example if she starts to get anxious when you put on your shoes, then ignore her and put your shoes on then take them off. do the same thing if she gets anxious when you grab your backpack, jacket, ect.. It may take a couple hours but continue to do it until she is relaxed or just doesnt care. Then graduate to walking out your door (keep your same routin with school/work, such as putting on your shoes, jacket, ect) and walking right back inside take your jacket off or shoes off then repeat this process and slowly extend the time you spend outside before walking back in the door. It should not take to long, if you could dedicate 2 or 3 days she should pick up on it. I would definently use a kong filled with some goodies for the next 2 or 3 weeks.     Remember to try to keep her calm while your leaving, thats the key. She just needs to figure out that you will always come back for her. Try to make your leaving the house a positive experience for your dog.

Ian|`|UbSJPBuNaa	no thats fine
IrdZKYT3aa	You should be fine, the foods not bad for either of them.  The tropical has a higher amount of protein compared to the vegetable content in goldfish food.  You don't want to risk over feeding the goldfish for the finicky dojo, I'd try looking into sinking pellets for him instead.  Perhaps try feeding once a day, or every other day to inspire him to get moving when food is coming.  Best of Luck!|`|wPUDjlEdaa	They should both be able to eat the gold fish flakes or the tropical stuff... watch out if your puttin two types of food in you may be over feeding them... just saying    GL|`|AA12186846	Sounds like all your fish are compatible to tropical fish food. No problems.|`|oKrXOwyKaa	Well, I would suggest  like the person who posted the answer above.You should  try  sinking pellets for your  loach.     Usually, I find that my fish are actually eating when I am not looking or viewing the tank (no idea why:P).   Some fish takes time to eat after your put the food in their tank    However, you could try bloodworms (don't feed him this everyday).    It's always a joy watching your fish coming up and eat those worms:).

VmLsQzm2aa	im not sure as to whether or your fishes have grown to full size but i a 120 gal with mostly chiclids you should be alright. i would t try shrimps i added a baby oscar to my tank and it immediately ate the shrimp small newts can hold there own in and aggressive tank and will it earthworms cool sight to see rope fish aren t bad but they are not very aggresive feeders you would need a tube to use to get food to the bottom of the tank for them there isnt a lot of community fish i would house with chiclids they would be constantly bullied sunfish make a good addition and should be able to thrive in your tank there are a few species to choose from so you should be able to pick one that will get as big as your chiclids as for the 70 gal here are a few of my faves    freshwater  flounders, upside down cat, clown knife, turtles (provided there is a dock), needle nose gar     brackish  stonefish, columbian sharks, eels     marine   just way to many options but if i had a 70 gal i would set it up put a couple of hardy salt water fish after it has been established for a few months remove the fish and get an octopus. i had a friend that had 1 they are extremely smart you can pick 1 up for around $60 they only have a two year life span so you dont have to keep the same things in your aquarium for ten years|`|WPqP3f6Taa	A good rule for how many fish you can put in a tank is by how big the fish will be at full size. 1 inch=1 gallon. I wouldn't recommend putting any peace full/community fish in with your Chiclids unless they are rather large, such as large fancy goldfish, but you have to remember that goldfish produce A LOT of waste, or you could possibly put a larger Bala shark in the tank, or pretty much any type of shark, as long as its big enough so the other fish wont pick on it.    As for the 70 gallon tank, maybe you could fill it will small community fish, since i wouldn't suggest putting any in your other tank.   I have a 55 gallon community tank, so if you would like to know what I have in it, feel free to ask.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Wow. That question was worded very well. Youve got my thumbs up. lmao.    http://animal-world.com/encyclo/fresh/ci...  Midas cichlids grow between 10-14 inches on average. Although you do have a large tank, the midas would claim just about all of it.     If your friend is giving away the 70 gallon, Id say get that and put the midas in it. It grows about the size of an oscar, and 75 gallons should be perfect for both of them.     The green terror should max out below 10 inches, and the kissing gourami can grow to 12 inches. I say put those two in the 120 gallon, along with the two convicts.    Do you know the sex of your convicts? A pair may cause problems, but the pleco would almost always eat the eggs anyways. It would be best to have two same sex convicts.    While I do understand that you want more fish, because right know they are young, but they will grow. The 120 may have some room left... But a full grown kissing gourami is quite aggressive towards other fish. The green terror isnt as aggressive as other cichlids of its size, its relatively peaceful for a cichlid. But peaceful for a cichlid doesnt mean peaceful... You might be able to get some community fish in there, but that might be pushing it. Id stick to another medium size peaceful-ish cichlid.    But, this is entirely my opinion. Thats how I would handle it. Or at least try to handle it.    (one inch of fish per gallon is bull****. can a 10 inch oscar fit in a 10 gallon tank? No. its thats simple. the rule is broken. and with cichlids and other aggressive fish, there is no stocking rule. you need to learn what each fish needs and what lengths it grows to.)|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Your tank is a decent size, and the fish you have are realy only semi-agressive, so you probably can keep a few more fish.    I would avoid any small fish, just because of the size of the fish you have.    Some larger peacefull fish like Silver dollars, clown loaches or Tinfoil barbs should be OK. If you cant find large ones, then the 70 gal tank could be set up with smaller community fish and used to grow fish to a decent size before going into the bigger tank.     Ian

uuudmeyyaa	"Breed the ckc out of them?" WTF???? That doesn't even make sense. I tried not to be rude, but that was a really stupid statement. I have never bred dogs because I'm a responsible owner and I like my dogs to have long life spans, so maybe I'm the one out of line... but my parents do breed and register horses, so I do know something about horse registrations, and with horses you just don't sign the foals up in the registry if you don't want to.     You can't breed a registry out of a dog, the registry isn't IN the dog. So maybe you should rethink breeding if you aren't the brightest crayon in the box....    And what is wrong with the CKC that isn't wrong with the other registries that I have never heard of? You can register a pet rock with the APR... at least the CKC has SOME standards...|`|PM23RDycaa	Serious my left foot.    Each and every registry you listed is crap or their standards are VERY low.    AKC, UKC that's it. Secondly you so not ready to even considering breeding. Find a reputable breeder who uses LEGIT KCs to mentor you if you are SERIOUS about breeding    Do it right or don't do it at all.    ADD: If you are thinking of breeding APBTs since that's all BFKC registers stick with the UKC  not UKCI|`|3zv2bbolaa	All the registries you list are supported in whole by backyard breeders and puppy mills. They allow pretty much any and everything to be registered without concern of heritage.     If you are serious about breeding, stick to dogs purchased from reputable breeders who are registered with the recognized, legitimate registries.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	PLEASE do not breed. CKC is a puppy mill registry. If you didn't want CKC you shouldn't have purchased a puppy from a mill or BYB or wherever you got him from.    You cannot breed the CKC out of a dog. A puppy mill dog is a puppy mill dog and will never be anything but a puppy mill dog. His progency will not be registered with anything other than puppy mill registries. There is the AKC, American Kennel Club, and the UKC, United Kennel Club. Those are the only two all breed dog clubs. Depending on the breed of dog your pet might be registerable with a breed club, but most likely not. No reputable breeder within a breed or all-breed club will have the slightest interest in your dog.    You CAN do some AKC events with an unregistered unpapered dog (CKC might as well be unpapered, it's not recognized by any reputable dog club, breeder or handler) such as rally and obedience, which would be fun. Why don't you do that with your dog, and just enjoy letting him be a dog?    There are millions of dogs suffering in shelters, dying in the streets and being euthanized due to pet over population. We don't need more dogs. PLEASE put your kennel plans on hold until you can get some real high quality show dogs that will enhance whatever breed it is that you enjoy and have the papers and registration you want instead of just reproducing in the hopes that maybe five generations away you'll get something decent.    There's no money in dog breeding unless you're mass producing puppies and selling them. It's cruel.    I am not trying to be rude or mean, I am just trying to be honest.    Edit: Yes, we are saying your CKC pup is no good. You may luck out and he will have good temperament and no health problems as he gets older and he might be a wonderful pet for you. But he should be neutered.|`|Bw18seFqaa	all of the registries you listed are scam puppy mill registries..  no reputable breeder uses these registries.    You cant breed the ckc out of the dog.. its the registry that the dog is registered with... the dog isnt eligible to be registered with any reputable registry, nor will any of its offspring.    You'd be better off to get the dog spayed/neutered.    If you're serious about breeding, you need to do more research, visit dog shows, get a mentor.. and find a responsible breeder to get a show-potential dog from..  you can expect to pay a few thousand to obtain a quality dog..  you will also have a strict contract regarding showing and breeding..  since you are a novice, you may also have a co-ownership on the dog.        That is correct.. your CKC registered dog is not a breeding quality animal..   back yard breeders and puppy millers use those registries because they have poor quality animals that are not eligible for AKC registration...  your dog is descended from poor bloodlines from irresponsible breeders.
LkdZPgvjaa	It means she could live if the surgery is a success.  There could be unknown factors, but surgery is always a very delicate task and could turn out either way.  You just have to wait and see.  Little birds are such delicate creatures, but they can live through an operation.  My prayers are with you and your bird.  I  know how precious they are and how they can become part of you.|`|AA11457471	Your mom has the right idea. Sorry.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I think your mom is telling you that your bird is in a serious situation and dhr  is trying to prepare you in case your feathered friend does not make it.  I would also mean that your bird need to be watched very closely and provided with exceptional care during this time.      I think prayer will help and I will also pray for both you and your little buddy.  Hope for the best, but be willing to accept the worst.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	Yes it means just that.  If you are a person who says prayers, you should say a prayer for her.  Wishing you all the best.|`|MzHwklzKaa	It means the doctor can't say for sure if she'll live or die.    He has to wait and see if she'll pull through, but has no idea how to predict if she will.    Best and warmest wishes for you and your little birdie.  I hope she makes it.    I'll say a little prayer for her.|`|zb3ImEQ6aa	Yes touch and go is bad. It means (if in surgery) that there are low points where there were complications. If before surgery it means there is a 50/50 chance and the prognosis might not be a good one  and if after surgery  that means there were complications and low points and close calls in surgery. Hang in there and I wish you the very best of luck!
gsgCbUTvaa	Ok so we all know that freshwater sharks are really not sharks, but the resemblance is quite remarkable.  So with that in mind, I still call them sharks lol..    Ok so you want to start a shark tank, I sure hope you have a nice size aquarium.  You may have to check with some of your local fish stores or internet for compatabilty.  But a general rule is if your buying the same species, buy either 1 or in groups of three or more.  Never by just two of the same species, or the more dominat one will often chase and pick on the other one.    Bala Shark also known as the tri-color shark, or silver shark.  Great species, grows to about 14 inches.    Rainbow Shark and Albino Rainbow shark  grows about 5 inches    Red-tail black shark  grows 4 -5 inches    black shark  grows up to 14 inches    Iridescent shark    columbia shark  grows between 12-24 inches    also there is another cool catfish that resenbles a shark.  The  Pimelodella Catfish  grows about 6 inches.    Hope this helps, and good luck|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	So did you want an actual shark, or did you want catfish and stuff?    Because there are no true sharks that live in freshwater.    Catfish and such...    Colombian shark. Silver shark. Bala shark. Red tail shark. Rainbow shark. Irridescent shark.    I dont know. Im just naming what Ive heard really. I believe silver and bala are interchangeable. But these fish cant be kept together due to size difference. Colombian shark and Irridescent shark would eat red tails and rainbows.|`|Rdpv91NTaa	Colombian shark  Silver shark  Bala shark  Red tail shark  Rainbow shark   Irridescent shark    hope i helped|`|W1VqOP83aa	Well if you want a real shark, then bull sharks are known to survive in freshwater. They are also known to attack humans and will probably need thousands upon thousands of gallons to survive. Other than that, bala sharks, rainbow sharks, red finned sharks, they might not be real sharks but they look pretty close...|`|AA12323504	...anything that the fish shop wants to sell to gullible people by calling it a shark, even though none of them really look like sharks.
kA62hPbdaa	Well, that type of thing happens but it isn't necessarily normal. He is uncomfortable, confused and sore, which explains the chewing.Bruising is not a big alert sign, but if he is biting or constantly licking his surgery wound than action should be taken. Rat terriers tend to have high anxiety and energy and when they are introduced to something new (like the cone or pain) they act out. Rat terriers also tend to chew on things. I would call your vet to see if there is something to put on his wound (like a taste deterrent so he won't lick...).|`|AA11457471	It's normal. Just like people, some bruise more easily than others. Don't worry as long as the incision is closed.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	just to be on the safe side I would call the vet and ask them and  check to make sure he didn't pull out any stitches|`|1fe38b8082e3a7523e8af4f7eabfdf6caa	You should have probably called the vet as soon as he chewed it off.  Also next time watch him closer... Call the vet as soon as possible.|`|moIPv7pFaa	I would call just to be safe. Dogs have a tendency to lick their wounds until they're raw which could pull out stitches and cause infection to set up. The vet might suggest a no lick spray or another collar to keep that from happening.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	A little bruising is normal but if you're concerned call your vet. If nothing else if something else happens she will be aware that something was already going on.|`|EeJMITyCaa	I would just to be safe. If he has messed with it, it could get infected. This is the reason they get the cone in the first place.|`|qlAbqkSkaa	DUH... YEAH!|`|koKvQrkXaa	Some bruising is normal. As long as the incision is not open he should be fine. Just keep him from licking the incision and try to restrict his activity for about 10 days.|`|5MFEr2Hhaa	Bruising is normal. After all, he has received what his body feels is an injury, albeit a necessary one.    Have you seen him chewing/licking, or otherwise bothering, the incision? If he is ignoring the incision, you may not need the cone. If he is chewing or bothering it, you need to replace the cone, as you don't want to have to get him re sutured.|`|WSbLf0BXaa	To be on the safe side I would have your vet look at the incision.  Some bruising can be normal - you can apply covered ice packs to the area for ~ 15 min twice a day and that will help to decrease the bruising/swelling.    If you notice any pus like discharge - that indicates infection and he should be on antibiotics.  Also, monitor him for signs of lethargy, not wanting to eat, etc. - if seen you should take him in.
AA12186846	What I would do is get a bucket big enough for a few gallons of water. Put the dirty water in it with the fish and clean your fish tank out good. But make sure you put additives when you put them back in. They should be fine.|`|AraBfesHaa	I asked a fish shop owner this question a couple of years ago.  He told me that it's o.k. the carbon in your filter should clear most of it, and the rest of it will sink back down and settle in with the gravel.  Luckily I didn't need to use his advice :), but that's what he said.|`|oKrXOwyKaa	I can't really give you a detailed answer like the others( Rarely encountered water/filtration problem).  Personally, I would drain about 50% of the water and you could either put/leave your fish in the water or put your fishes in temporary tanks. From there  take out all the gravels and clean it with hot water and leave to dry.|`|VmLsQzm2aa	keep doing partial water 25-35% changes it might take a few tries before it clears up are you using a siphon for the substrate? it should help get out the rest of the dust on your gravel. when adding new water try to pour it in without disturbing the substrate . you could try and i dont know how well it would work but with a good sponge filter sure grab up the loose debris after it runs for a few days rinse it out in a sink and place it back in your aquarium. i don t know what fish you keep but there are some pretty good water conditioners that will clear up cloudy water but i dont think you can use it with invertabrites|`|ba3bed4c746fa8c9badc146322f48b1caa	i hate to tell you this but the best thing is to change the water.....do you have any fish yet? if you dont then your fine, just get all the gravel out and wash it in hot water, reallly good and then put it in there then add water and filter it, or if you do have fish try and get a bigger filter, or you can well it depends on the fish, see my b/f's rosequeens, well we dont really filter the water we use a waterhose to fill out tank cause its huge, we also have two fillters, going, we use a hose type thing to suck out all the dabre and as we do that we add water, but not fillterd water, and we had our fish for 3 years, now, so it aldepends on the fish, like tropicl i wouldn't do that i would go and get filterd water, how are the fish acting? see when i did that the gravel thing, they started to stay at the bottom, and they turn colors, meaning they arn't "feeling good". so we knew that somthing was reallly wrong, so we just used the water from out side, i used to have tropicl fish like mollys and guppys and i wouldnt use anything but water from the store, fillterd water when i would change my tanks, and they lived happyly so it all depends on fish alll fishes are diffrent, i saw the ladie clean the tanks from the fish store and i saw her use the regluar water, so idk here you go i got this from a site     http://www.renton.wednet.edu/salmon/grav...  How to Do A Complete Gravel Wash   This job will take 1-3 hours depending on how much help you get. It is the last resort when conditions in a closed system tank have gotten out of control. Generally there are two ways this can happen.    Gradual mess: The tank has gradually gotten so messy from over-feeding, under-cleaning, and overcrowding that moderate maintenance (2-3 buckets of water twice a week) is not adequate to keep the pH above 6.4 and the ammonia level at zero.    Catastrophic mess: Someone has overfed the fish so drastically that the water is cloudy and smelly and the fish are in visible distress. Unless you act fast, they will die.    There are two ways to address the problem:    Print out the checklist of tasks.  Assign tasks to various people.  Supervise.  Check off tasks as they are done.     Print out the checklist of tasks.  Give a martyred groan.  Get to work.  Check off tasks as they are done.   Here is the checklist of tasks:   First take the fish out     1. Fill a five gallon bucket 1/2 full of dirty tank water. Fill it the rest of the way with clean tap water. Mixing old and new water is necessary to avoid injuring the fish by changing their water conditions too fast. If you have a bucket to spare, prepare two buckets of water so you can divide the fish between them.          2. Remember to add the appropriate amount of Shieldex to dechlorinate the tap water.          3. Aerate the water in the bucket with the tank pumps and airstones. Check to be sure the airstones are putting out a good stream of bubbles. If they aren't bubbling vigorously, put on fresh airstones. If you don't have replacement airstones, pull the old airstones off and run air through the bare tubing. Do not put salmon in a bucket without good aeration or they will suffocate!         NOTE: If your fish are very young or weak, put the bubbling airstones just below the surface of the water so that they will not generate so strong a current in the bucket.          4. Net the fish and put them in the bucket. Set the bucket in a cool place while you deal with the tank.           Clean the tank    NOTE: DO NOT USE SOAP - ONLY WATER!!     1. Unplug all electrical aquarium equipment except for the pumps aerating the bucket of fish.          2. Drain the tank completely.          3. Rinse tank with clean tap water. Wipe the inside with a clean paper towel.          4. Disassemble, rinse, and wipe the filters, tubing, thermometer, etc. Rinse the sponges and oyster shells in running tap water.          5. Replace the airstones if they are clogged.           Clean the gravel     1. Take out about two cupfuls of dirty gravel and set it aside. Because cleaning gravel with chlorinated tap water will kill most of your friendly waste-eating bacteria, it is very important to save some dirty gravel with bacteria in it to re-colonize your tank.          2. Put the rest of the dirty gravel in two buckets.          3. Take the two buckets of gravel outside and set them on the lawn or sidewalk. Jam a garden hose deep into the gravel of one bucket and turn the water on full blast. Stir and rinse the gravel vigorously until the water runs clear. Repeat for the other bucket of gravel.           Reassemble the tank     1. Reassemble all the tank equipment and put it back as it was in the tank.          2. Put the clean gravel back in. Put the two cups of dirty gravel back in.          3. Refill the tank with cold tap water. Remember to add Shieldex to dechlorinate the water!          4. Plug in all your equipment. Check to be sure everything is still working properly.           Prepare to put

Eyawiwc5aa	*shakes head @ pet stores* ... Many pet store employees usually do not know the proper care for iguanas, or many of the pets they sell. Leaving a light on 24/7 is NOT a good idea, iguanas need to sleep at night, they prefer NO light. The colored night lights can sometimes cause stress towards igs, plus many of them burn out pretty fast.  Glad that you are now turning the Basking Light and UVB off at night. Hopefully you are using a proper UVB.  The dome combo personally I don't care for, because you should be using 2 UVB tubes for your iguana, but it's okay if that's all you have for now. CHE's provide the best to help w/ night cycle, they produce heat only NO light.    UVB: (12 hrs on during day - 12 hrs off during night no light)  US: ReptiSun 10.0 distance 8-10 inches from your igs body  Repti Glo 8.0 distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  ReptiSun 5.0 distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  UK: Arkadia distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  - You will need to adjust the distance as your ig grows  - Using a shop light from a home improvement store works the best, get one that has 2 tube plugs and using 2 UVB tubes  - The UVB listed are in tube form, using the 36-48inch tubes are the best more length for your ig  - Surface under the UVB tube lights need to be a flat surface if at an angle your igs body will not get the proper UVB threw out. You also need to change the UVB tubes listed above every 6months  - There are UVB's out there on the market now that can cause eye damange to your ig (do not use the compact or the coil type - see the uvguide.co.uk for further information)  - W/out UVB your ig may end up w/ MBD (Metabolic Bone Disease)  - UVB information that you may find interesting:  http://www.uvguide.co.uk    Hopefully your little green one is in nothing smaller then a 55gallon tank. Depending on what the wattage and living space is, you do need to make sure that you are providing the proper temps also.  Temps:  never let drop below 70F ...  basking 92-96F if temp is too low digestion is slowed too high food digests too fast and nutrition is lost  medium/middle (overall) 88-92F  cool 75-84F  at night 73-84F ... having a temp gun works the best to know what your igs body temp truly is.  *** NO HEAT ROCKS PLEASE ... they can cause major burns on the under belly    Sites for you to read:  http://www.greenigsociety.org/ - http://www.iguanaden.org/ - http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html  A great book to read and have on hand:  Iguanas for Dummies by Melissa Kaplan  Yahoo has some great sites for Iguana owners... these groups helped me and still help w/ questions .. if you'd like to join:  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyI... - http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Iguan...|`|Yn5ADAd1aa	sounds like your doing a great job. you do need to get a alternate heat source for night. when its time for sleep use a red light that provides eat and uv. everything your doing sounds pretty good.|`|xe7mylLmaa	Iguanas must have a day/night cycle.  This means that you must shut your iguana's lights off at night or better yet, have them on a timer that turns them off at night and on again in the morning. Failing to provide a day/night light cycle will stress an iguana, causing behavioral changes such as feeding, pooping and unnecessary aggression. Iguanas can and should have cooler temperatures at night, but they still need ambient air temperatures to fall no lower than 70 degrees.     Some people use nighttime blue or red light bulbs to provide warmth at night. Some iguanas do not mind this at all, while others are bothered by the light and have trouble sleeping. You may want to watch your iguana carefully for signs of stress if you decide to try these nighttime bulbs.  Personally, I use a heating pad covered with a towel to provide night time heat.  Some folks use Ceramic Heat Emitters (CHEs), which screw into an incandescent light fixture and give off only heat, not light.|`|WvejdIrJaa	You need a uvb bulb and a bulb the lets light and heat in the cage.They need twelve hours of light and twelve hours without light.Who ever told you to keep the light on 24-7 is wrong.If it gets to cold in your house and night and your iguana need heat get a heat bulb for night time like an red bulb made for reptiles so it's not so light.|`|wZKb8egaaa	Are you using UVB or UVA lights? UVA is a HEAT lamp and UVB is what iguanas need for to keep their bones strong.  Also if you leave the light on all night then the ig is not sleeping. Not well anyway. You only need the lights (UVA and UVB) on for 10-12hours a DAY they don't need light at night.  You should never listen to pet stores, they have no idea what they are talking about.   Check out these sites:  http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Farm/...  http://www.greenigsociety.org/  http://www.todaysplanet.com/pg/beta/liza...  This Book: (You can find it in a store I just want you to know what to look for)  http://www.amazon.com/Iguanas-Dummies-Me...  These Sites for adult size cage plans (a whole lot cheaper then buying cages already made):  http://www.ronhazelton.com/howto/iguana_...  http://www.lizardcages.fws1.com/iguanawo...   http://www.lizardcages.com/    Good luck and please do more research before buying from pet stores they never know what they are talking about. And I hope that you are not feeding it crickets or any kind of animal protien (dog food, cat food, meat of any kind, bugs of any kind) it can cause kidney desies that you probaly wont notice until it's too late (it can take years to appear) but it is deadly.  These are very expensive animals and if you know that you can't spend around $800 -$1500 in it's lifetime - not counting the food and some lights, just the tanks (a 55g to start then the big cage when it out grows the 55g). And please read up on the food because there is a lot of things that can kill them, these are VERY hard to take care of and they can be VERY mean when they become adults.    P.S. Night lights (red/blue bulbs) do not provide UV they only provide heat and some iguanas don't sleep well with night lights. If you need a night time heat source then use a ceramic heater. They don't have any light and they screw into the heat lamps.

They are evil people!|`|EeJMITyCaa	Of course but how are you going to prove that they are doing it. And better yet why do they access to your dogs? Are you one of those people who just let their dogs get lose? If so they are probably tired of dealing with your dogs. Or do they howl all the time? Because I know that if I had a neighbor who's dogs howl all the time I'd probably think about doing it to!|`|qGKANnYoaa	you will need evidence  and yea you can sue them  have fun!|`|ghItgMZxaa	yes and that is also animal cruelty they can be charged for it.|`|TPbJJYN4aa	You shouldn't sue them. If they really did feed your dog poison, then you should contact the police. That is a criminal act, and they will be charged with a crime.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Yes you can sue, also call the animal control/pound for your town. Besides you being able to sue you can also have them arrested for animal cruelty or something similar in most places.     I would take the dogs out of the dog run and put them indoors for now obviously. If the neighbors rent call their landlord once they've been arrested and see if you can get them evicted. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to prevent them from getting at the dogs anymore- bigger fence, security system, motion lights, etc.|`|un0gLSXKaa	My dads, uncle and grandpa are lawyers.

You'll have to give all the evidence that you can that it was your neighbors who killed your dog.  However, without concrete evidence, it won't likely go any farther than that.  You need to file a report, though, because it begins to create a body of evidence that you're going to need if there are any future incidents.    I would also IMMEDIATELY install security cameras and put up "No Trespassing" signs.  That way, if your neighbors enter your property, you can charge them with trespassing and you will have the evidence on tape.    Also, are your dogs outdoors all day?  I would bring them in (they really shouldn't be outdoors all the time, anyway) whenever you can't be outside to supervise them.  Your neighbors can't poison your dogs if they don't have access to them.    Again, I'm very sorry to hear about the death of your pet.

8NSh1D4Maa	1. You can tell at 6-8 weeks.  Information on sexing is here: http://www.rabbitnetwork.org/articles/se...  Males will not have dropped testicles yet, so you will need to closely examine the shape of their genitals.    2. Diarrhea is a serious concern with rabbits.  If you've given any veggies to a rabbit that young, that's probably what the problem is.  STOP vegetables if you've given any, give unlimited grass hay, and if it doesn't clear it up right away, the rabbit needs to see a vet before it dehydrates and dies.  3. The buck needs to be housed separately AT ALL TIMES from the female.  Otherwise he'll re-breed your female at the birth, or even during gestation, resulting in back to back to back litters which is hard on your rabbit's body and just a bad idea.  Plus he can seriously hurt the kits.  The male and female can ONLY be together for breeding, then immediately separated again and the female is always to be taken to the male's cage, not the other way around.  Your babies need to be separated by sex by 12 weeks, they can get pregnant or impregnate mom as early as 13 weeks, potentially.  Really, take him out and have him neutered.  Then have her spayed as well once she's weaned the kits. Like other pets, they should only be bred by people aiming to improve the breed and carefully selecting the best of the best to pass on their genetic material, it does not sound like that's what's going on here.  There are tons of homeless rabbits out there, they are very very hard to find good homes for.   4. He has some sort of skin condition.  Possibly mites, possibly a viral or bacterial infection.  Both your rabbits need to see a vet to have the problem properly diagnosed and treated immediately.  If your other rabbit is showing symptoms as well, obviously it is contagious and your kits will probably also have whatever it is.  Again, you need to take them to a vet to get them help.
hCK0yqDRaa	Dwarves don't drink much water. Are you feeding him or her any veggies? If so, then they are getting water from them.|`|VZAN5FUaaa	are the other 6 dwarfs drinking their water though?? if not you can dress up as snow white and give them some water.|`|oMTsDcNBaa	Are you sure she isn't drinking while you aren't looking? That's probably the reason why.|`|AA10605655	It sounds like it's probably sick.

iojR7vVIaa	Genetic diseases - grey cataract (mostly older Degu's) mostly caused by diabetes which is either genetic or caused by feeding a Degu the wrong food      Unfortunately cataracts are not possible to cure, but if you start feeding her a good diet, she can live a long time even with a cataract. You may stop it from getting any worse. They manage worse eyesight very well.|`|z1QBNLACaa	It sounds like you need to see a vet who specializes in exotics.  Most pet stores are out to make money and may or may not have correct information about the animals they sell.  An experienced vet can not only tell you about the cloudy eyes but also help you with housing, food choices, and any other medical issues, which are common with animals passed around from one person to the next or that come from pet stores.    We see exotics come into our vet's office all the time who are very ill due to poor care (housing, food, etc) not because the owners were mean, but because they really had no idea what to do, and often the pet store led them down the wrong path in the first place.  It's also helpful to talk with a rescue that handles this type of animal because they'll know what online or book resources are good ones and which ones are worthless.  They'll also know who the good vets are.    Some exotics vets are listed at http://www.rabbit.org/vets/vets.html  These are rabbit vets, but often treat other exotics.    I don't believe cataracts are reversible.  But it doesn't sound like you really know if that's the problem.  You won't know until a vet takes a look.    Many social animals still do not get along with others of their species.  It takes more than just getting another one and hoping it works out...
EJpiaCMQaa	Peguins eat plenty of fresh fish.  And I mean PLENTY.  That is their favorite food.|`|zakbXGK6aa	Most penguins are exclusively carnivorous.  Some penguins, however, will eat seaweed.  I doubt that a penguin would like pie, unless it's filled with meat, and even then they may not like the kind of meat that you put in it.  I'm sure that they'd like a fish filled pie, and they'd have no problem eating off of an icy floor.
WtGo7w18aa	I think just having a big dog in sight will be a deterrent.    With our economy like it is, it's not going to get better.

Good Luck!|`|crS1HZ9vaa	it seems you just want an alarm well geese can do that job. german shepherds especially senior dogs who are well advanced in their years compared to human years and their senses are going to be low like the hearing she may not hear that well,through the years she may have gotten accustomed to people so much that she may not even see them as a threat.her eyesight may also be poor,and believe me when i tell you she may not even have the energy to get up to even greet you,so think about it. a GSD of about 3 yrs would be your best bet but if you don't want to spend time than I think you should avoid the whole dog owning business and get an alarm monitored by your local police and get some much needed sleep.|`|OtuqLvJwaa	*sigh*  Please don't adopt a dog if you're not willing to give it a good home for the rest of its life.  Particularly with an older rescue (and particularly with a German Shepherd, who get VERY attached to their owners); they just need a quiet home to spend the rest of their lives with.    That said, you don't need a German Shepherd who will "tear anyone apart".  I have a German Shepherd and I've found that his simple presence is enough to make anyone think twice about trying anything.  While walking him late at night, I've had him turn suddenly and bristle a bit at a stranger who was coming too close, and even though I know that he would never bite anyone, I also know that he will likely never have the chance, because any thug will stay away from him.    I've also taught him to growl on command, which is a great trick.  I use an obscure word so it never comes up unless it's on purpose, and for him it's a big game, like teaching a dog to "speak".  He doesn't know that he's being scary for my benefit!      Anyway, German Shepherds are great dogs and they will keep you safe without ever having to lay a tooth on anyone.  A senior could be a good option for you, but remember that as a dog gets older, it's going to need more care (and likely a lot of money if it ends up with medical problems in its later years) and could live for quite awhile, and so make sure that you are prepared for the commitment BEFORE you adopt.
vS1Z0inOaa	It is perfectly normal for her to not baskas she settles in. RES take to the water as their first line of defense, so they tend to only bask when you're not around. As she grows used to you, she'll eventually let you see her bask and may even let you pet her while she's sitting there. But that may take a few months for her to get that comfortable, but after a week or two you should at least start hearing a splash when you enter the room meaning she just jumped off the basking platform.     You may want to check the temperature of the basking area though. if the area is not at least 10 degrees warmer than the water, the turtle will have no incentive to leave the water. Test it right at her level on the rock and see if you get a reading of about 90 degrees. If so, just give her time.     To help her feel more secure, you can place a ock just below the water surface. When resting, turtles oftentimes like to sit on ocks so they are underwater but can stick their heads up and get air without having to swim to the surface. This is the onl way a wild turtle will truly relax becauseresting on a log they ar still alert and ready to take to the water and resting on the bottom of a lake they still have to surface now and then to breathe. In fact, wild babies oftentimes bask on floating aquatic plants and never leave the water. Yours will eventually feel secure and will leave the water just ike older turtles, but you can give her a plant for now as she settles in if you like.     While it's true that a 20 gallon tank will quickly become too small for a RES, it is perfectly fine for a tiny baby. The general rule of thumb is 5 gallons of water per inch of turtle if it's under 4 iches and 10 gallons per inch after that. So your 20 gallon tank, theoretically, will be fine until she grows to be 4 inches long. That's a general guideline thogh, not a hard and fast rule.     You're doing a great job. It truly is better to be safe than sorry, so keep asking!|`|WvejdIrJaa	That tank is way to small for a red-eared slider.It sould be between an 80-90 gallon tank.Make sure you have a uvb bulb in there to because that is how they get calcium working in the sistem.|`|knSFIgWTaa	My wife and I have had ours for about a year.  Ours did the same thing when we first took it home.  Just give it about a week or two and it should calm down.  It normally goes under the basking light when no one is around.  Usually we sneak up on it to watch it bask and when it sees us, it flies off of the deck to the bottom of the aquarium like we're coming to attack it.  I think that so far you have done a excellent job with your turtle.  Upgrading the tank is good idea but if you are short on money, the turtle will do just fine in the 20 gallon for a few months.|`|uAeEVUO9aa	i have two also, and they swim like crazy into the walls too!  I don't think you need to upgrade the tank, i was told they grow to their environment, so if you get a bigger tank it will grow bigger.  I also sneak up on mine basking in the light and then they dive in as soon as i walk in the room.  Just keep an eye on her and make sure her shell isn't softening up.|`|ld2vmypNaa	http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...    these are so skiddish and run when they "feel" ya coming they feel through vibrations since they have poor eye sight and hearing. Mine are 37 yrs old and 75% of the time they still scatter when approaching their pond.    some advice?  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.    Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle..   ***You need a heater...set at 80 degrees.   If water is cold they will stop eating!     Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care.   They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish and first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits in and  cut up in small pieces and drop in water. A  few pieces 4 times a week.   Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.     Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. And in the winter their appetites slow down some.  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it thats fine!!    Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow.   So they need a turtle basking dock.   Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot.   You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank in a 60 gallon my girls were in one, I used two double sided marine or penguin filtersIt really helped keep it cleaner!     They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle.. ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.    Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10 in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ years plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You cant start sexing till about 3 across. Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Do not cut the males nails!!  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.    ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell.   Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin, treat by adding a 1/4 of a cup of aquarium salt per 5 gallons to irritate and hopefully kill fungus. The addition of sulfa drugs such as those sold at pet stores under the name "Dr. Turtle".

Keep an eye on the temperture under the basking area if its too hot or too cold it wont be comfortble up their. when my res was young it didnt bask to much and they do like to run into walls and they hit them prtty hard sometimes haha
SnAsZapMaa	[Anubis * Star]: Are you for real?  ? The only colours allowed for GSDs are black and tan, of which black is compulsory, tan optional.  ? Those come in the patterns termed wolf-sable or saddle-marked or self-black. Bi-colours are just saddles with a homozygous modifier added.    So, except for the darkest sables, I can tell what pattern & colour a pup is while the dam is still cleaning it up. I can't always predict EXACTLY how much tan there will be, and whether that tan will be red-gold or just gold (or, occasionally, fawn, but NEVER cream or silver), but so what? All standard colours and distributions are acceptable, and the differences between them come into consideration only (a) in the show ring, to separate dogs of otherwise equal quality, or (b) when deciding whether a particular stud/brood has enough pigment to compensate for the paling and/or black-loss of a prospective partner.    [Chelsey M]:  You are dreaming. You simply can't afford a dog that cheap.  Any pooch you would find for that price NEEDS to be wormed and vaccinated and neutered (because it is poorly-raised "crap"), added to which it will be VERY high risk for disorders such as elbow dysplasia, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, and various other expensive problems that help vets pay their bills.  Regardless of the purchase price plus vaccination & neutering costs, if you are in a heartworm area there is the constant expense of the preventative (unlike roundworm, killing adult heartworms usually kills the dog too - dead worms block up its heart valves).    And the only way you can get a "brown & tan" is to go to one of the "breeders" of off-colours - people happy to ignore the stipulation in the Standard that all GSDs have a black back and a black nose. To THEM their particular off-colour is more important than type & character, but there are so FEW GSDs with the off-colour you desire that breeders have almost no choice so they often breed from animals that should have been neutered or even p.t.s.  ? The most likely meaning for the "brown-&-tan" you seek is liver-&-tan, a severe thinning of the black, caused by the recessive  b^ b^  combination that also causes light eyes and liver nose, eye-rims & pads; a thinning that allows the tan at the centre of each hair shaft to reflect light. In most years the AKC registers less than dozen livers. When  it comes to dogs, rare doesn't mean "good", it means "unpopular because it isn't good enough".  ? The second possibility is that you want a "Collie"-sable, caused by the dominant A^y allele. Trouble is, I don't believe that that allele is in the gene-pool of genuine GSDs - it is only in the recent mad era of cross-breeds with cutesy-invented "breed"-names such as Cockapoo that they have started being seen, from which I deduce that they come from fairly recent cross-breedings with yellow-sable Collies or ginger-sable Corgis.    Join The_GSD_Source: http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...  (it's instant) then click Photos and look through the albums on GSD  Colours and Off-Colours - I've only just started them so you won't find many livers yet, and no "Collie"-sables, but they will become available once I ask for them in a week or so. Other parts of that group site will give you much information about dogs in general as well as the specifics of GSDs.    For the amount you have available a rescue group or humane society shelter is the ONLY reasonable answer. They usually can't tell you anything much about the background of the dog, and they won't let a pup go until it has been vaccinated & neutered, but usually they sell (if you & your property are good enough to HAVE a dog!) at a price lower than you would pay your vet for just the vaccinations and neutering.    Truly, the ONLY places to EVER get a dog are:  (1) reputable breeders  (2) rescues/shelters  NEVER encourage a puppy miller or greedy ignorant BYB by giving THEM (or a pet shop - reputable breeders will NOT sell to a pet shop) your money.    How to tell a reputable breeder from the others?  ? They are proud of their kennel name so insist that every pup they sell is registered with THEIR kennel name - they probably registered the pup before you contacted them.  ? The parents of their litters are all certificated for a host of things - hips & elbows, show gradings, training qualifications, maybe even a Breed Survey Classification (BS.Cl.1 or 2 in English, KKl.I or II in German).  And, most important:  ? They are so confident about having minimised every risk that they supply a printed & signed Guarantee that actually MEANS something,  it's not just a way of wriggling out of their responsibilities should any genetic disorder develop after you've had the pup for a while.

More likely then not, it is some backyard breeder throwing two dogs together to make a quick buck. Shepherds are prone to hip and joint problem, anxiety problems, and aggression problems if bred improperly. The last thing you want is an unhealthy poorly bred shepherd.    either be prepared to spend 500-800$+ for  a shepherd whos parent's have been OAF hip tested, or adopt from a shelter. finding a pup that young is unlikely, but every state has a shepherd rescue, and you can find plenty of purebred,  BEAUTIFUL german shepherds. My local rescue has a beautiful sable male, and a pretty black and tan female. I want them so bad, but I already have two boys, lol.    BTW, at that age, it is very hard to tell what the coloring will be. The parents will be a good idea, but the dog could grow up to be bi-color or sable.    if there are tan hairs spreading up the back hips through the black, that is a good indication that your shepherd will form a saddle and be a normal black and tan, but the saddles dont really come in until the pup is around 1 year old    My older boy looked like any other black and tan puppy, but grew up to be a bi-color. His dad was black and his mom was black and tan.    My pup will have a saddle, the tan hairs are already spreading up his hip, but it looks like his brother will be a bi-color. Both his parents were black and tan.    Good luck in finding a puppy, though! But do NOT settle for a bad breeder just because it is cheap!

TYohMrlXaa	You can never turn the filter off. This is the main place that grows the ammonia and nitrite eating bacteria that compose your "biological filter".  These good bacteria are essential to the well being on your tank, and they will die without water flow. Please read up on the nitrogen cycle to learn more.  http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.ht...|`|AA11457471	No.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Run your filter 24/7    When the filter is off the ammonia builds up, and the cycle bacteria die off. Not a good thing.    Ian|`|wPUDjlEdaa	No you still want it to run overnight..|`|b28575cda6dd4d85b7ebf0f8185b9849aa	No at all, good bacteria in the filter needs Oxygen to survive and do its job and the filter is a need to Create water circulation. During cycling stage the filter must be running for 24 hrs a day. later shutting the filter for limited time (2 - 3 hrs) will not cause harm.  good filter do not cause noise, check with the seller is your concern is the noise from ur filter.
w4DIPHf1aa	just put him and his heater in a smaller bowl for now and get a proper heater tommorow.      the smaller bowl will allow the heater to work properly.    make sure you use the water he is in right now, not new water.    he can take it cold for a bit, but a drastic change in temp even if its warm is far worse for him, everything must be gradual.      and don't feed him in his smaller bowl, .      good luck!!!|`|gUsJlTvKaa	If it feels freezing it is way to cold and you don't need a heater to tell you that ( even though its a good idea to have on regardless). What you should do is make sure you have it away from any windows, as im guessing it is very cold outside?. Also a desk lamp or something similar would be good to put over the top of his bowl, as well as the towel. I don't think adding warm water is a very good idea though because the rapid change in temperature can bring on stress which will in turn make him sick. Also if you have a heat mat anywhere you can use that as well.|`|DIeA7BG9aa	When I needed to heat my beta's bowl I would put a heating pad around it.

It gives them pancreatitus somehow...|`|udLtA7T7aa	well ham is very salty you can feed her a little bit but dont give her too much because its bad for them and same with cheese loaf if it low fat cheese and stuff like that give her a little bit my dog loves cheese his names harry hehe    hope that helped =)|`|uO8sFIuCaa	Fat trimmings from ham and other meats and high fat meals are not safe for dogs, as this can lead to pancreatitis in dogs. This can be mild or can become life threatening, so don't give her much.    Cheese and other dairy products aren't great for dogs either, because up to 50% of dogs have been shown to be lactose intolerant.    Ham and cheese are both high in salt, this is as dangerous for dogs as it is for humans, and so overloading her with salt will be detrimental to her long term health.    she is better off with a good quality dog food that meets her nutritional requirements... but the occasional treat will be pleasing to her. Buy treats that are designed for dogs, or give her foods that are safe for dogs to consume.|`|5MFEr2Hhaa	Feeding your dog leftovers and unhealthy human food is NOT a good idea. It can lead to flatulence, diarrhea, and pancreatitis, not to mention it can encourage your dog to become a finicky eater.|`|qlAbqkSkaa	If you can eat eat, they can. It's bullshit when the say, do not give them grapes, onions or raisins.  I say, did you ever just had grapes or onions for lunch or dinner---they all answer no! So, anything in moderation is good.   If you analyze it, most dog foods are made with meat by-products (ears, nose, hooves, ligaments, innards like lungs, hearts, livers and even blood, surely you don't eat those. So anything good enough for you should be okay for your child.
vJBEnFVzaa	I have a 1.5 breeding tank and I do a 25% change 2 times a week since its really small and then gravel and everything else once every 2 weeks.|`|gUsJlTvKaa	The best way to do it is to change 1/3 to 1/2 of the water every week, so leaving most of the water still in there. Having a smaller tank will mean doing water changes regularly is more necessary because the tanks gets polluted so much quicker and makes a bigger impact than in a larger tank.    You should really never be taking out the gravel and cleaning that in fresh water, because the gravel is there to hold alot of good bacteria the fish need for them to stay alive and healthy. By cleaning the gravel you are getting rid of all this good bacteria. So before you take the water out for a change just stir the gravel up a bit so you collect some muck when with the water.     A common mistake what people make to is if they forget to clean there tank out for a month they think they need to do a bigger water change, when they should actually be doing very small water changes every 2 days. You never want to change your fishes environment so much that they will stress, because stress brings on sickness.    A water change should only take 5 Minutes and will make life easier for you because your fish will stay healthy and you wont have to come on here asking how to cure a sick fish.|`|qvETfwthaa	I would probably do at least once a week. 1.5 is very small. But just keep an eye on if the water gets cloudy or not|`|AA12186846	Once every one or two months. I don't understand why people think its necessary to clean out there tanks once a week.

Then he will get a booster shot and will be all covered. :) Enjoy your puppy.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Im sure he will be fine.

You can get them inexpensively at places like Petco, but it is best if you take him to a vet for a through examination.  He will probably need to be wormed.

8NSh1D4Maa	Your average Yorkshire Terrier will bark a lot MORE than your average Maltese.  Yorkies are terriers, bred to hunt small rodents, they're high energy, highly strung dogs, whereas the Maltese was bred as a companion.  If your Maltese has been properly socialized with other dogs, there is no reason that he would not get along with a second dog of any breed, though if he's past the 'puppy phase' he may well be annoyed at a young puppy harassing him.  Introduce him to some young, boisterous puppies first and see what his tolerance level is.  If he gets annoyed, look for an adult companion instead.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Depends on the dog. The Yorkie I had didn't bark very much. Only when something was wrong.
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	1. have you had the vet run a fecal test to check for worms?    2. how are they drinking? Are they drinking normally, or more than usual and peeing more than usual?    3. Have you had the vet run a urinalysis to check for a UTI?    another possibility is you're changing the foods too often.    you should get them on ONE food and keep them on ONE food.     Everytime you change from Kitten chow to Friskies, to Special kitty, their systems have to get use to another mixture of ingredients...     this seriously upsets the digestive tract wich can cause diarrhea and/or smelly poop.    if you must change their diet... make sure you WEAN them onto the new food. That means taking what they've been on, adding a little of the new food and taking a little of the old food away each day until they're completely on the new food. The process should take at least a week. Any sooner and you'll upset their digestive system.    I know you don't want to hear about the food, but unfortunately feeding friskies is like feeding your cat big macs every day. They're not healthy, the meat content is very low, and allergents like soy and corn is high.. as are unnecessary fillers such as byproducts. (which is everything BUT meat.) and instead of vitamins they're full of food coloring.    If you can't afford a decent bag of food like Innova or Felidae... try Blue Buffalo cat.    They don't have unnecessary fillers, and they have a higher content of actual meat which a cat NEEDS. its also reasonably priced.    Kittens poop does tend to be more rank, their pee tends to be more odiferous than adults as well... but I'd take a poop sample and run a check for worms, and try to get them on ONE brand of food, and try to get a slightly better quality of food such as Blue Buffalo. Like I said, it's not as expensive as most high quality foods, but it's a higher quality than most store brands. I don't think its available at grocery stores, but you can get it at stores like Petsmart.)|`|fxuPCUyLaa	Make sure to use ONLY stainless steel food/water bowls. Not plastic or any other type.  ask your vet-|`|AA12186846	Well, kittens poop tend to smell bad or worse than adult cats. Actually any cat that isn't fixed, there poop will smell worse. I took my kitten for the vet for this and he didn't have worms. He told me that the little one was just eating too much. Also, to make sure not to give him wet food until he is older or just introduce it slowly. Give them something like kitten chow. A big bag for my cats- and I have four will last exactly a month and they are big eaters. But I also give them wet food now that they are adults. But it might be a good idea to get him checked for worms. But you might try this first. Gl|`|tatbIu54aa	I agree with Aravyndra  Try something Natural like evo Wellness or Pet Promise.  here are some links  http://www.petpromiseinc.com/products.ht...    http://search.onlynaturalpet.com/search....   hope this helps:)|`|tZIqb3Yqaa	oooooh, yeah, he MAY be allergic, take him to the vet. that, or hes trying to adjust from other foods.  did you just get him?  if so, he may be trying real hard to adjust and it may not be working as planned.|`|LxBwmRTlaa	Chalie must have a sensitive stomach.The best thing to do would be to take him to the Vet for an exam (In case it's something else that's bothering the health of your kitten) and he or she should tell you what food would be suitable for both your kittens...|`|AA10859773	It's quite possible.  It's more common than one might think.  It's also possible he has what my last vet called "kitten stomach" and that he'll get better in time.  However, I wouldn't count on that and in the meantime, you're both suffering.    If you can't afford better food, you have a few options.    First, consider adding a supplement to his food which will help him digest it better.  You can try things like digestive enzymes or probiotics.  DE's can help cats to break down the carbs in their food, and considering what you're feeding this might be a good choice.  Probiotics contain live bacteria and they work a little differently but they can have the same effect.    Purina Kitten Chow Nurturing Formula   Package: 18-oz box.     $2.99    Package: 3.5-lb bag.     $6.99    Package: 7-lb bag.     $10.99      Consider this - for just slightly more, you can buy a much better dry food.  Evo.  Package: 2.2-lb bag.     $6.99    Package: 6.6-lb bag.     $18.99    Package: 15.4-lb bag.     $39.99      I know the price for the 15 pound bag is alarming, but if you compare the smaller bags, it's really just a little bit more.  And so well worth it!    For the canned food I can't think of a brand that would compare in price but hopefully someone else will.  But even if you just change the dry food, you may see improvement.    Probiotics:   1. Jarrow Pet Dophilus (powder) http://www.cheapvitamins.com/Product/Pet...   2.

Sedona Labs, iFlora Multi-Probiotic Powder  http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx...  6. Garden of Life Primal Defense  http://www.garden-of-life.biz/primal-def...     Probiotics can aid with digestion. They can be useful when dealing with gas or loose stool. Per my new vet, probiotics are a good thing to add to any cat's diet. She recommends using them only 2-3 times per week rather than daily, and not necessarily in the recommended amount (meaning less not more).     When you start using them, you should add just a pinch to the food, and then gradually increase that if the cat is tolerating it without any smelly side effects.     Dosage: I'm not measuring it, but I guess I add about 1/4 tsp. I dispense this 3 days per week.     My vet also suggested varying the brands from time to time. As you finish one bottle, try another.     How to choose: My vet also suggested not using one made for humans only because it may not be the right kind of bacteria. Avoid Saccharomyces boulardii which is from yeast. It should be dairy free, contain more than one type of bacteria, have a high number of organisms and few additives. The first two listed above are the ones I've chosen to use. They were recommended by the users in Whole Cat Health. The other two were also suggested by users of that group, but not as highly.     Dr. Goodpet has a good line of digestive enzymes.

Originally, pits were bread to be smaller, not these massive 70-80 lbs you see running around today.  That was done because people wanted a bigger, meaner looking dog.  A healthy pit should only way about 60lbs max for a male and 50 lbs max for a female.|`|hoeN5xP0aa	They normally reach their full height at one, but they bulk up and their bones develop more and thicken until they are about 2 years old.
AA10433969	I agree with candy on all acounts. That is my hammies type as well.  First off, I dont know what your wheel looks like, but I do know that most metal ones have holes in them like a grate. This should be  1 reason to toss the thing because hammies feet, especialy dwarf hammies feet get caught in the grate. That aside, I have a criter trail wheel that you attatch to the cage via pipes. I dont know what your cage looks like and if that wheel will acomidate but I am really happy with it. My wheel lasted about a year without me ever hearing it, and then it got louder and louder. I (at my dad's sugesstion) put vasiline on the axel, about 2 weeks ago and it is perfectly silent again. Also, the Vasiline has not goten on my hammie (at least yet), perhaps cause it is thicker then cooking oil or spray. There is a wheel called the silent wheel, which I have not personaly tried but sounds promising. And a wheel called the Puzzel wheel which I have personaly tried and it is perfectly silent as well. Good luck!|`|jbadYvl0aa	I own a Campbell's Russian dwarf, and 10 syrians. I'm a HUGE fan of the silent spinners, they are wonderful! I suggest you get rid of that metal wheel, I don't suggest anyone buy metal wheels for any small pet. They can get injured way too easily in more ways than one. Their paws can get stuck in the grid of the wheel, they can also get their limbs and necks stuck in the frames. Since you have robo's who tend to run a lot, something like the small silent spinner would be perfect, if you have another wheel with a spindle, you can take chapstick and lube the spindle up with it. Before I got my hammies the silent spinners that's what I used to stop the wheels from squeaking. It holds up wonderfully, it won't melt, and it only gets soft enough to work itself around the spindle, and the best part is that if some does ooze out, it's not going to poison your hammies if they nibble on it.|`|qGy9fR7xaa	You could try the oil idea to stop it squeaking and that, or you could get a silent wheel. I have one for my hamster and a larger version for my rats. They also do tiny silent spinners for mice!   Try this pet supplies website below, this is just one place where you can buy a silent wheel. If you ask a big pet shop or even buy it on ebay or amazon, you'd be able to purchase one.     http://www.ukpetsupplies.com/Details.asp...

XPB6Ogj0aa	I'm going to do some "assuming" here.  If you towels are on the floor I assume that you have used them after a bath/shower and therefore they are full of your scent.  Your cat is re-marking them as his and that you are his.    No matter how it smells to you, the odor of past "markings" is still on the towel.  You need to wash them with white vinegar to completely remove the scent, two to three cups per wash load.  This is worked well with me in the past (and future).|`|AA11457471	More than likely your cat has a urinary tract infection. They tend to search out soft things to pee on when it hurts.  A UTI can become life threatening very quickly to male cats as the urethra can block up.  He needs to go to the vet ASAP.  Good luck & best wishes.  PS.

qgeI6Chxaa	Here's one site that sells good quality dog food at reasonable prices. You can buy as much as you want and have it shipped to your house, plus every 10th shipment is free.

It may only be for herd animals, but I'm pretty sure they have cat and dog food.  The thing about bulk, especially for dog and cat food, is that you won't find quality.  It just doesn't make financial sense for companies that can make a good buck selling the smaller packs to sell it for cheap in the larger packs.  If you want to stick with your brand, contact the supplier, Natural Choice, and ask them if they sell to anyone in bulk.  That is really your best option.|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	I don't know if this will help or not, but...Are you a member of Petco? For every 10 bags of food you buy, you get one free. They send you a coupon in the mail after the 10th purchase. I know you can also buy the food on their website. Not necessarily cheaper like buying in bulk, but the free bag is worth it.
vAH98IE2aa	Some of these answers are correct and some uneducated and some are just misguided, Any Good veternarian will tell you that Most Dog food is Not as healthy as they claim, Also You Do Not feed Puppies Dog food You feed them puppy food there are a few veterinarians who sell organic home made dog food And Yes they contain chicken and rice Not parts that can be unhealthy like dog and puppy food manufacturers that do not want to tell you what they really put in their products Your dog will Not become sick from eating chicken and rice However Do not feed him/her the bones they can splinter and cause internal bleeding as well as they can become loged in their air way. Also Just because your pup is active Does Not mean they are healthy some diseases as well as sickness's Do not always show All symptoms all at once. You Need to post more information for people to truly understand your situation and be specific. There could be multiple reasons your Puppy is not eating, Be sure to check his stools for worms the best way is to have a fecal sample done Also check his urination Is he/she going to the bathroom often enough? Does He/She have visible Blood show in his/her urine or fecal matter? How often is he/she skipping her meals? There are so many question in order to properly answer yours The best advice is Get a veterinarian to examine your puppy If you can afford a puppy you can afford a vet bill If you can not afford the vet bill and are going to base your puppies health on answers from Uneducated people making guesses with out all the facts and who are giving answers from their own experiences or feelings regaurding a matter Then you can not afford a puppy and should find a new home for him/her Not be be mean but Truthfully Be responsible.|`|EENiBG0Saa	my questions dont appear|`|bpyx92GZaa	First thing first, you don't want to feed him human food, he will get sick. Its okay to give it to him as a treat once in a while but my picky dog went through 4 different brands of food and he LOVES Purina Beneful and they do have it for puppies, I believe its the purple bag. Alot of dog food gives them a gassy tummy to but not Purina Beneful (Thank God)...lol  Active is a good thing for him, as least you know he is not sick or anything. Is he at least peeing and pooping outside? If he is hungry he will eat. If your really worried about him call your vet...:o) Good Luck, I wouldn't worry to much.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	well first off i wouldnt recommend people food. that could get him sick... try a new brand of food maybe hes just put off by the food you have. my dog is like that she wont eat anything but science diet....|`|gpON465Iaa	normal, dont worry|`|EeJMITyCaa	He'll only eat rice and chicken because you gave it to him and it tastes better. He should be eating dog food so what you do is only feed him dog food and no snacks. Leave his food down for 15 minutes and if he hasn't eating it then take it up and give it to him the next meal. It may take a day or two but he'll eventually eat. A healthy dog won't starve himself.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	He is training you quite well.  Keep it up and he with have you chasing cats up trees.  LOL!  Just kidding.    This is very normal. You need to get him on a balanced diet.  I have known cats that would starve themselves if they did not get the food they wanted, but, nevere a dog.    Unless you notice your dog starting to lose weight, I would just leave the kibble out and leave him.  He will play you like a fiddle; but that is ok; you don't want a stupid dog.    It is your responsibitly to make sure he gets a healthy diet.  The dog is like a little kid that only wants to eat foods that are bad for them.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Actually rice and chicken is great for a dog. But just don't feed him. eventually he will get hungry. Put the food out. Leave it there for 20-25 minutes and then pick it up. Don't feed the dog again until the next feeding time. Don't give in. Don't let the dog nibble from you or the family. Eventually the dog will get hungry and eat. and he will learn to eat when you put the food out and not to take one or two bites here and there.|`|I2GnFoTLaa	then feed him what he'll eat! YOU DONT WANT HIM TO DIE RIGHT?!?!|`|uxqkJEIcaa	Then keep feeding him that. Just because he's a dog, like other dogs (haha), doesn't mean he doesn't favor some foods over others.

If not, then stop complaining and deal with the finicky dog YOU have created.    1.)  Start mixing the rice and chicken in with a little amount of kibble    2.) Slowly decrease the amount of rice and chicken added to the kibble    3.) Completely take the rice and chicken away    When you dog is hungry it will eat the food.|`|un0gLSXKaa	I have a 10 month old husky..  I know how that is!    She is so incredibly active and gets tons of exercise.   She really doesnt each much more than a couple scoops of food a day..  no matter how worn out she gets.    I've worried about the same thing too.  My dog trainer said not to leave the food out for them to leisurely eat.  They should eat when they're hungry.  Only feed your dog when your eating.. he will eat his food and he wont beg.    The dog whisperer had an episode on it too.. where this lady had to cook her HUGE dog steak or chicken.  Im talking expensive!!    Like she literally baked her dog a huge dinner.  IT wouldnt eat regular dog food because the dog was so used to it.   But the dog whisperer didnt feed the dog all day then worked him out SUPER hard and finally fed it at night when it was starving.  Then the dog liked the food and she was able to just feed the dog regular dog food.    Hope it helps!
zakbXGK6aa	You'll have to ask your local or national government that question.
dE5fs9yzaa	Is he "fixed"? If not, he will continually roam, looking for girlfriends. The shock is from the dryness in the air, carpet (On your floor) and static electricity. Get him neutered and he will stay home. Cats like high places to begin with but because of the way their claws curve, they sometimes can't get back down! Like climbing a tree. if where he goes on the house, and he can get back down by himself, the only way to stop this is to block his way there.|`|AA10436595	If you mean he gets a shock when you catch him, it's winter time and his fur and a person walking on carpet and then touching him causes static electricity.
fvNu3IHOaa	I'm also in MO. Just East of K.C. I'm not criticizing (promise), but your question doesn't give enough of the pertinent info, and that may lead some to think that you know much about horses (besides the fact that some horse people like to be snobs anyway!).    My questions to you are this:    What breed is your horse? This is the first thing you should post!  What are you asking?  What have YOU personally done with him? Training wise, I mean.    Forget Craigslist. Forget auctions. Anstines (in Kingsville) has been reporting horses dumped after every sale! The loss of horse slaughter has caused hell for the lives of horses all over the country!    You can try equine.com or dreamhorse.com, but the reality is that if you have an ugly or even mediocre looking horse (which you claim you don't) you can't give them away unbroke. Especially a stallion. Many people are under the wrong impression that stallions = cash cow. Most stallions = pain in the F-ING ***. Green broke ones always do!    The best bet is to break your horse! Once again, that may sound harsh, but I'm not being mean and/or criticizing. If you are unwilling or unable you need to contact someone who can.     Please email me with pics and responses to the questions above at bobbeedob@yahoo.com. I MAY be interested, depending on the quality of the animal.    Hope this helps!    ***EDITED TO ADD***    When I said "What are you asking?" I meant price wise. I re-read this and just thought I should clarify.|`|FDW159pEaa	you shouldpost some pics on the internet just like umm i know  http://www.oodle.com/sale/pet/supply/hor...  http://www.findapetonline.com/  Sorry thats all i could find can i see a pic of him i love horses but ican't get one =( but i horseback ride nad hopfully will rent on for 500 per mounth =(|`|Z9eH58d7aa	I am so sorry all I can think or is craigslist.

usjfCSZwaa	I had a female rat terrier for a number of years. You obviously feed them dog food. They have somewhat intense drives but not to the degree the JRT does. They can also be somewhat difficult to housebreak (common in small breeds) and are extremely prone to barking. I mean manic barking. They can be quite loving at times but will get snappy. They are trainable but it def. takes awhile as they are very stubborn.Very energetic and playful.They will more than likely chase small animals, as they are terriers.    They also may have allergies to certain ingredients in their food and some mild skin problems.
fHG29qT4aa	You do not need to call the dog wisperer. The reason she dose not pee and poo when you chain her up is because, she wont go where she sleeps. Also carpet feels like grass and is soft she probly dose not go to the bathroom in your bathroom or kitchen dose she.   (Im asuming you have tile or something like it in those places) It dose not feel like grass. you will probly have to do reasurence training with her like going out side for 10 min and rewarding her when you come in and there is nothing there slowly increas the time in 5 min intervals over the corse of a day or 2 and you will have to repeat every few days.   Dogs are like a todler and only positive repeditive training will work. you will have to do this for awhile and dont be bumd if it happends again just correct, cleen and do the training over again it will help. I have 4 dogs all are progect pup dogs that go into hospitals and so and did all the traing myself.|`|xCLX9Aczaa	You sir, need the....DOG WHISPERER!|`|D2sMKkchaa	Leave her outside for 10 minutes and let her calm down a bit.  She will "pee" outside and not inside.  If she still does it lay out newspaper on the floor where your dog "pees" then if she still does it then your 3rd choice is going to be...  The dog whisperer.  And final choice:  Say/shout:"No bad dog go to bed!" and break the habit.  After all that and she still does it take her to the vet because you do not know for certain that the vet was right she may have a bladder problem the vet might of just got it mixed up.  But I doubt that.  Oh and keep doing carpet cleaners.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Invest in a crate!  Crate training can be done at any age and it works!  Most dogs actually love their crates, when properly trained with them!  Clean the carpets with Nature's Miracle after you've purchased the crate. Good luck!

JwYwsrTzaa	Responsible. Like you said, you are only going to breed him IF he passes all his health tests, has titles and to well-qualified females.    The irresponsible ones are the people that don't care about health issues or show quality and are just trying to make a quick buck. I don't see anything wrong with what you are doing.|`|vPde97E2aa	Asking *ANY* breeding here PROVES you don't know anywhere near enough.  Babbling about hips being done at 6 mons. is MORE proof.  Imagining a PUP is a washout ? MORE PROOF!     Breeding from UN-PROVEN/TITLED parents......how much more PROOF do you need?|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I think this show true responsibility a lot of people seem to just want breed regardless of anything. You say that youre going to get your dog checked out to see if it would be a viable stud, also the pup has good lineage and you plan to have him trained in something that his kin got titles in. You also got the dog that is not show/breeding quality fixed.|`|YNdcFlulaa	no|`|tvlELUloaa	Not at all...     There are FAR worst things you could do to a dog then breed them. I honestly dont think breeding dogs is bad|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	No, you aren't a bad owner. If you are genuinely contributing to the breed, I see nothing wrong with it. As you know, do not breed him unless he is an excellent example of the breed standard. If he's titled, completely healthy and of very sound temperament, and you work closely with other breeders to ensure the best offspring possible, go for it. If you were breeding a dog that was physically unqualified, of unstable temperament, or simply for the prospect of making money, then yes, I'd consider you irresponsible.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Auppy that is stubborn at this age, you know can be trained and more than likely comes out of it, he is just pushing you around to see how far you will let him go  LOL    I would not consider neutering this dog till you can do all the testing, and OFA cant be done till 2 yrs of age....so get all your other tests done, and wait to OFA him...if you want to do further training with the dog, then wait...if not gonna do further training then neuter.    I know your a responsible owner, or you would not be considering the options, you would just hold back and do it..which not choosing to do.    so, let the little guy get the tests, all the tests he deserves, then get all the training on him you can...if he warrants the training.    but a GSD at this age being hard headed is not unusual, give him a good chance...and since you have already purchased the pup, please give him a fighting chance to prove himself, okay    good luck|`|BDRIeLqUaa	since you can't OFA a dog until 2years if age  I'd wait and see how those go before I made a choice|`|8z6UPhG2aa	Nah|`|YRTYXfggaa	Wait until he's 2 years old, then get his OFA's done.

Make sure there's no health conditions (like you said you would) and the same for the *****. And make sure the female has not been bread several times in the past. 1st or 2nd time is good|`|Xa9esMTEaa	Never ever neuter a working dog before the age of 2 years. If you do you'll be taking the one thing he needs to do high end Schutzhund work: Testosterone! After he's fully mature (2 years) it's fine to have him neutered and it will in no way affect his working ability. If you're still interested in Schutzhund it'd be in your best interest to take him to your local Sch club and have him temperament tested. It'd also be a good idea to get him started right away on leathers and obedience (positive reinforcement only for now of course because he's just a pup). Good luck and I hope this helps. Btw, keeping a dog intact for 2 years means that you have to be extra responsible for 2 years...it's not that hard, just keep him fenced or leashed and in sight! Good luck again!    Edit: The breeding talk is WAY too premature, he hasn't even proven he's a real German Shepherd yet aka hasn't stepped on a Schutzhund field yet much less proven himself to be stud worthy!|`|beec2f445a2f6c8a9e45a63f5ad1bbacaa	No you're not a bad owner. In fact I'd say you sound very responsible.    As long as he passes all health tests and has a good temperament, and you choose his mates with as much 'research' has needed, then those are the dogs that should be mated. As a Shepherd owner I'd love to see more of the 'Working' lines being bred with care.  It's a decision only you can make but be aware, there are a few problems keeping a stud animal as a pet. Talk to people in the 'know', go on a dedicated site, and ask owners of 'breeding' animals.   There's nothing wrong with keeping a dog intact if you are a responsible owner and make sure they don't have 'accidents'  and the decision to neuter doesn't have to be made till you know whether he really is worth breeding.  As most breeders prefer a stud who is 'proven' then 'working' him seriously will not only give you more chance of getting the right interest in his qualities but it will give him the type of life the breed needs. Even if not breeding,  doing some doggy activity will give you a better pet! It might cure his 'stubbornness'.    Good luck, whatever you decide.

I took my GSD Sam when he was only about 2 out fishing on the lake with me. All day he was content to stay in the boat...that is until we docked the boat and we were back on dry land. He looked over the edge of a concrete bank (the water was probably only 2 feet from the top) and saw some minnows. Out of curiosity he tried to take a closer look and SPLASH, head first in the water. He got tangled up in his leash and was under the (pretty cold) water for about 9 or 10 seconds until I could reach in and grab him by the nape of his neck and yank him out. He came out looking like a muskrat, snorting and blinking. Oddly enough, after that whenever he'd see water he'd jump right in...he was a great swimmer!|`|YNdcFlulaa	my dog farted,thensuddenly fainted  lol

You do have to be consistent with this training or he won't learn.     Please don't hit your puppy, that will only promote aggressiveness.|`|APxHOFG4aa	If your dog is chasing people he might think it's all a big game. If his behavior seems to be aggressive you should get professional training. If he gets big and still bites he might not get much leniency from animal control if he breaks skin. He is going to be a big dog so you shouldn't let him ge used to doing stuff that will get him in trouble later on. Being a German Shepherd, He'll probably take to obedience classes right away. You can get these classes at petsmart.|`|NxwSdiBGaa	He is just a pup...  search a friend for him...  with whom he can play ...
DuLhv7Ajaa	Shes marking you, my dear. The dribbling pee is not a weak bladder, but a way to mark their territory and claim ownership of something. Rats are like dogs in the sense that they need to know what belongs to them by what it smells like.|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	I've had rats in the past, too. All I can think of, is maybe it is an affectionate thing... kind of like the way dogs mark their territory and cats mark what "belongs to them." Perhaps your rattie is marking you, affectionately, as hers.    My ratties did not do THIS particular thing to me... but frequently, when I was doing chores with a rattie on my shoulder, I would realize pee was dribbling down my arm.     I understand that you may know all about rat care, etc, but obviously you do not know about this behavior. Why not go to a rat fancier's website and ask this question there? Hang on and I'll fetch a link for ya...

It's like affection in a way, her peeing on you is like her saying "you belong to me" or something like that.  She's marking you, but in a good way.

This is a good thing. She is bonding with your hand/you.
rgmOlPJraa	A healthy bird would always seem to be energetic and with intermittent eating sessions.   While a sick bird will look tired, droopy with ruffled features and would always have the tendency to hide its head under its wings.  Some of the tips to recognize the sick bird are as follows:  1. The bird would be frequently sneezing and having discharge from the nostrils.  2. If suffering from breathing disorder then symptoms like making a clicking sound while breathing can be seen.  3. Sleeping more and less eating, etc.    For more information try the link below:  http://www.petcaregt.com/petbirdcare.htm...|`|uqU5W7vaaa	They will "puff" up their feathers, spend a lot of time on the bottom of the cage, the wont open their eyes when you walk by as much, they may seem very tired and not as playful. They might start pulling their feathers out too because they are upset or stressed out. Basically any odd or weird behaviors can indicate that they are sick. Unless its just something playful that they stared doing.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Signs of illness in pet birds are sneezing, sleeping too much, not eating or drinking, a clicking sound when it breaths (usually air sac mites), favoring one leg (usually means it's broken), laying at the bottom of the cage alot, fluffed up apperance (they do this to conserve body heat), unusual looking droppings (watery stool, green, yellow, or tarry black.  (Tarry black can mean internal bleeding), having a red, inflammed, or runny cere (the cere is where the nostrils are and located above the beak), open mouthed breathing (a sign of a respiratory illness),  dirty feathers, weight loss, not chirping or talking, tail bobbing (can indicate a respiratory infection), any growth on the bird (could be a cyst or tumor).  Always have your bird checked by an avian vet if the bird exhibits any of the above symptoms or you suspect an illness.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Some good answers above.

Wing or foot hanging in case of fracture or dislocation. Sores or Bleeding from any part of the body in case of injury. Check stools if they are excessively watery, dark in color , foul smelling, or streaked with blood.    Activity - Abnormal (low or hyper ) level of vocalisation or movement. Inability to grip perch due to weakness - bird is sitting at the bottom of the cage. Panting or wheezing indicates extreme heat fatigue, blockage or respiratory distress.    Appetite - not or barely eating, excessive thirst etc;     First step - keep warm ( use an infra-red lamp at a reasonable distance from the bird - shouldnt get HOT )    Second Step - try handfeeding the bird's favourite food - something soft, warm and moist (cereals , mashed veggies or fruits if it is not a seedeater) mix some rehydration formula in the water or a little sugar and salt if the formula is not available immediately.    Third Step - take the bird to your Vet at the earliest.    I think that covers most of it.    All the best !

mXpaE6V6aa	I had to deal with putting my dog that i grew up with down last July. It was the hardest thing I have ever experienced. He had cancer in his shoulder and the doctor said it will only get worse. I wanted to keep his around as long as possible, but then my family and I realized that it is best to put him down so he can die a happy dog, rather than a dog in severe pain. You don't want your dogs last days to be full of pain do you? Its entirely up to you, but I would wait a little bit, give it a couple weeks maybe. Say your goodbyes, take a lot of pictures. and then let him go. 17 years is a really long time for a dog to live. My boxer lived until he was ten. It is going to be really hard at first and you are going to be hysterical i'm sure but you'll get past that stage and come to a stage of understanding. I promise. Time heals everything.   Good luck,  I will pray for you   everything will be okay :)|`|W02kTOqmaa	Until it is cruel to keep your dog alive, then I don't think he should be put down.

Until it becomes hard for him to even get up, like on a consistent level, or until he stops eating or drinking, i dont think you have to put him down|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I am truly sorry I lost my dog this past December, she was 15 ?  I probably should have had her put to rest months before I did. I just couldnt bring myself to do it.  If your dog is in extreme pain it would be best to let him be at peace. The groomers that we used also told us that as long as she was happy.  If your dog still seems happy and is only having a little trouble getting up and down. Then he may have some time left but reality is that at 17 he probably does not have a whole lot of time left so I would cherish all the time you have.

Your dog has bad hips and for him to be 17 and still get around pretty good sometimes tell me that it really isn't that bad !  If you don't want to seek a second opinion, my advice to you is asperin, baby asperin...The 82 milligram kind chewable...Put it in a treat so it's not on an empty stomach...I can't believe for the life of me that the vet didn't suggest this..  A low dose of asperin a couple times a day will reduce the swelling in his hips and make him more mobile...Asperin in small doses is perfectly safe for a dog but will take a toll on his tummy if given on an empty stomach...

Most dogs don't live to be 17 years old and his body is having issues that come with being an elderly dog. As long as he is still trying to move around and his appetite is normal, I don't think he should be put down.

So sorry|`|KvmjaU86aa	If your dog still put the effort to carry on despite the struggles and pain what makes it our right to say if it still wants to live or die? Most animals if they feel death is near will not even eat let alone get up and walk. Then that might be the time to think about it but why not just let nature take it's course and let him die in peace at home. Sounds to me he's not ready to go yet.      I use to own a cat when I was younger and he stayed home for days until he crawled underneath my bed and passed on. He didn't go out and wander about outdoors. He just decided to stay where he was most comfortable at which was home. I didn't know he was going to die but he did and he stayed home. He died a peaceful death, his way and his choice. You might want to think about that before you take your dog to Dr. Kavorkian. I believe in what he stands for but it's only because I make that choice for myself and it's my right to make my own decisions whether I live or die.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I know how hard this is for you. I had to put my beloved best friend to sleep recently.  I wasn't as lucky as you to have my dog for 17 years, she was only 7yo, and she had cancer.  She had regular vet and oncology care. She lived free of pain for longer than we all expected.      The two most important considerations for me were to keep her pain free and to allow her to retain her dignity.   I would never have been ready to let her go but I needed to do what was best for her and living in pain wasn't it.  I could not keep her alive for my benefit if it meant she would suffer.   It was about her, not about me.    I miss my girl every day and I always will, she was very special but I would rather put a much loved dog to sleep peacefully one day early  than be one day late. One day late would cause suffering.  She deserved better from me than to hold onto her because I couldn't bear to part with her.    You love your dog and you will do what is best for him. I feel your pain and I feel so sorry for you.  Please be guided by your vet.  He knows the physical condition of your dog.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Since he is not in a lot of pain, you might try giving your dog glucosamine and chondroitin, to see if it helps with his getting up and down.    I have had two elderly dogs who had problems getting up and down because of arthritis, and it helped both of them considerably.    I would not put down an animal that is not in pain, can still eat and move around.|`|CHCPnvksaa	I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through. I know what it's like to have a pet that is considered family, and it is a very hard decision to make. If the vet thinks that the best thing to do is euthanization, then he is probably right, but I would recommend a second opinion. Putting a pet to sleep is not the vet's first choice. If there was any chance at all that medication could help, then he would let you know, and also what the chance is that the meds will work. You have to figure too that your dog is 112 in people years, and at 16 years old, he's at the average maximum life span for his breed.  Be thankful that he was able to spend so many happy years with you. You have to do what is best for your dog though, and a lot of time, saying goodbye really is the best thing. If you do decide to put him to sleep, make him a steak dinner (yes I'm serious) and make sure you're there to pet him and hold him as he's going down so he'll know how much love he's taking with him.
AA10487501	of course ur behaviour is understandable.  anyone in ur place would do so. and I am sure she knew you were in trouble too.  i was in the same situation as you 3 years ago. i did not meet with an accident but depsite taking my dog to the vet i could not save it because it got an awful infection.  he was hardly 7. and i am happy that the little time he spent with me were mostly happy moments.  i still think of him and i am sure he's living a better life now.  I also pray for him and I used to feel guilty too initially that I could not do anything for him.  But i know he will forgive me for this.  Just think about the good moments you spent with her and forget the sad ones.  Ur love for her will never die. and this is the most important thing.  cheer up :)  u may bring another dog home if you want to overcome ur grief.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I can understand why you might wonder, but I don't think you should beat yourself up over this. Circumstances were a bit beyond your control. Would things have been different if you had been in good shape yourself? Yes, maybe, probably, but you weren't. It sounds like it was time to put her down when you did, because of her condition. She could well have been sad simply because she didn't feel well.     I had something similar. One of my cats was limping a bit while I was having chemo and completely zoned out and hardly able to do all that needed doing, and not thinking well at all. It didn't seem too bad so I kind of let it go. Later, when I was better and the cat was having his annual exam, the vet found that both his knees were shot. It was too late to fix it, and he limped for the rest of his life. I felt awful, but when I look back, I made decisions when I wasn't functioning well. I can't go back and change it. You do what you do at the time you do it, and there is little point in regretting it. All you can do is learn from it and resolve to do things differently the next time.|`|Eug52iQDaa	I think the hardest thing anyone will ever do is make the decision to let a family pet go.  In your case, you gave this dog many loving years.  It's easy to look back and pick apart everything that 'might have been'.  Don't.  There is never a right answer to the questions you're posing.  You did love her.  That is ALL that matters.      I've had to make the same decision for many dogs, unfortunately.  My heart bleeds each and every time I do because of the 'what if's'.  Ultimately, you make the decision that you do because of the information you have at that time and you do so with the quality of life of the dog in mind.  You also make that decision knowing that your life was so much better because of the love of that dog.      Let her go in peace, sweetie.  Rest easy.  You did make the right decision, bless your heart.  Concentrate on the good times you had with her and celebrate her life.  I think that might give you some comfort.    Take care.|`|YNdcFlulaa	I think you did the right thing because the dog is safe|`|BDRIeLqUaa	It sounds to me like you did the right thing  when you take a pet into your home, you make a promise to take care of their needs.  To me, when your pet is no longer having fun, and the bad days outnumber the good- it is time to let them go.  You don't want to remember your pet only in a sad state- I have had a lot more people tell me that they wish they had acted sooner, and put what was best for their pet above their own needs  You did the best for your pet.|`|1fe38b8082e3a7523e8af4f7eabfdf6caa	You did.  Even though you may not feel like it.  You really did.  Would you wanna be old and laying around taking medicine all the time, pretty much living just off of your medicine?  I bet not, she was probably suffering and miserable.  That is why she slept so much.    May the wonderful dog that was a loyal companian to you for so many years  R.I.P, she was loyal to you that long, you were only paying her back by putting her out of this world.  She doesn't have to suffer anymore.|`|LfkGklCcaa	yes|`|42jReuOMaa	yes, you did the right thing. she had lived a long happy life for a dog! you went above and beyond what most pet owners would do! and it sucks that you feel guilty about the last few months she was with you, but honestly anyone would have a tough time with that situation! don't feel guilty. i'm sure she knew she was loved|`|R0g2otNhaa	I think you did do the right thing.|`|jS6Qkj0faa	it sounds to me like she had a great life and you did the right thing. Im sure she loved you to the very end. Its ok and normal to grieve over your friends like this- when i had my 12 yo dog put down i cried so much the vet staff didnt want me to drive home because they thought i was going to crash.|`|1347a52075d3edb68d04d0d43362cb2faa	I think you did the right thing, personally, it is nice to hear from dog owners like you those type of things and the sacrifice that some of us are willing to do for our best friend and companion. I'm sure God is feeling very proud of you and smiling saying: "Good Job"|`|L6C66lAJaa	I think you did the right thing. She knew you loved her. I dont think her declining health had anything to do with your accident, or the fact that you were short tempered with her. Sometimes its hard to let go of something, once we start thinking about what happened before the passing. However, if you love your pet, then you have to do what is best for them. You let her go, because you knew her quality of life was not one she would want to live. You adopted her, and gave her a loving home. She knew that. She knew you loved her, and she loved you. When an animal is ready to go, they let you know. She was ready to go, and lived a long life. I had a 16 year old Lab Mix, and I loved him so much. I still do. When I walk past his picture, I always make sure to say hello to him, and that I love him, because I believe he can still hear me. Might be crazy, but it helps me. Good luck.

You may want to check with a local guinea pig rescue since they frequently have already bonded pairs available for adoption.    You can house as many sows together as you have room for.     As a side note, it is a myth that boars cannot get along. You can have two unaltered males get along very well and be the best of buddies.     Good luck!|`|tQN4lGKOaa	it would be ok ..they run in packs anyway...as far as how many girls i would think as many as your cage can hold..i have 2 girls and they do just fine.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Absolutely.    Spaying is a pretty invasive procedure and doesn't have much benefit for pigs, so is not normally recommended. Neutering males is less invasive.  One neutered male guinea pig can live with any number of females (females don't need to be spayed if the male is neutered). Males and females usually get on fine. Many rescues have neutered males looking for a home and a girlfriend - or bonded pairs of one neutered male and one female.    Females can be kept in pretty much any size group, as long as you have enough space!    Just bear in mind how important adequate space is - lack of space is a common cause of fighting.  Two guinea pigs need at least 7.5 sq feet of floor space, three need about 10.5 sq feet etc.    Hope this helps!|`|EXisORX2aa	I believe that you can put them together.      did you know they eat guinea pigs in Peru? It's disgusting.... :( I love the little creatures.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Pleas keep in mind that guinea pigs are not like cats and dogs, they are very fragil. When they have any surgery there is a 50 50 chance  they will not make it. they can not be put out like other animals, a second person has to be there with them at all times just to make sure they are all right.    for that reason it is not recommended that you spay or neuter them plus it is extremely expensive. You can keep as many female guinea pigs as you wish together in one cage or you can only have one as a companion pet. I have had many companion pets and they have been very happy pigs and very healthy as well. I did spend a lot of time with them as well as allow them to sleep with me is they chose, which is a real kick. if you just have one they bond to you and you become their companion or partner and they are so very loving to you, if they are with other pigs they will bond with them and not be as loving toward you as they have the other pigs to show their affection to.    good luck|`|po62AbPqaa	yes you can put a spayed male and female together    I have housed 6 guinea pigs together and I have a friend that houses 12 together...you must have lots of room though for them to be happy and healthy    I currently have 4 girls housed together and they are very happy together, they huddle together and keep each other feeling safe and provide company to each other    good luck :>|`|uvU5DnHcaa	If you want more than one pet but don't want babies please get all girls.  How would you like to live with a girl being neutered and all and not being able to love her , but cruel I think.    Buy as many girls as want providing your cage space is 2ft x 2ft sq for the first pig and add an additional 1ft sq for each other pig. Buy the girls all at the same age and at the same time. You won't have any problems with them then.|`|TyTMrtEwaa	Of course you can. You can keep as much as you want together as long as you have a large enough cage, enough money for food and other necessities.|`|q11Ktlojaa	MMMMMM, Guinea Pig (Cuy) so tasty, I love them with a little bit of peanut sauce as well.|`|8EyDsAt6aa	If they the male is neutered and you know this 110% that he is then there is no problem with it. For girls you can put as many together as you have room for/ can provide for so they don't fight. Normally one adult guinea pig needs at least 6 square feet. 2 need about 10. To me that's a little excessive, but if you want to prevent them from fighting and barbering its best to keep a minimum of 4 together. Try CavySpirit.com for information about cages for the piggies.
wSc7ZdBCaa	This type of ad is usually placed in a dog type magazine or other source that is available to mostly dog oriented/ focused people.    Yes, co-ownership is a viable way to benefit the breeder and the co-owner. The benefit to you the buyer/co-owner is: You get a quality dog that has tested (& hopefully registered) well for what the breed is known for.     They will want someone who will be willing to show the dog, work with the dog and when the dog is judged to be a good candidate for breeding... you and the breeder will share in the resulting puppies. Most breeders that do co-owning will want the first pick of the litter. It would be up to you and them to workout the actual arrangements agreeable to both of you.    Financially = you may or may not be charged a fee. The fee is much less than if you were to buy the dog outright. What you are doing is getting a dog that is like in real estate "rent to buy option". You pay some money and then you get to buy a house.    In this case you get a dog that you WANT and you eventually end up having total ownership after certain requirements are met. Example:  You see a particular dog you want, you sign an agreement, you do the required things (show the dog, get points on the dog, pay for the necessary expenses - the same as you would with total ownership, -  you eventually breed the dog to the chosen stud, you fulfill the arranged division of the resulting puppies and you end up getting the registration papers and total ownership of a top notch dog.     This is a wonderful way for someone who is interested in a particular breed of dog who: wants to help improve & better the breed by showing in confirmation, obedience, agility, field, etc.,They either don't have the large amount being charged for a quality dog of this particular breed or they are beginners and want the assistance, experience and knowledge of the breeder who can provide these things.    If you are truly interested in WORKING with a particular dog and want to find out about co-ownership. Talk to a reputable breeder, ask for recommendations/referrals who will answer your questions about what their experience was with this breeder's co-ownership agreements and plans.    Note: the only question for me is what exactly do they do for "neurological stimulation!" That would be the first question I would want answered before I asked all the other ones.|`|0b27c16dd325e2296a8900a92d1cba9faa	Seems like a legit ad to me. It's better to sell any intact puppy on a co-ownership. Both co-owners have to sign litter registration papers, so if a dog has a litter against the breeder's permission- a co-ownership would block the litter's registration. I've seen this done with show dogs before.     Co-ownerships can be many things, so insist on a contract. Some are just pet homes for show dogs, other times breeders may have quite a lot of strings attached. If the breeder wants to retain the rights to breed the female dog, you need all the details in a contract.     My guess is that this breeder has a nice litter and not enough time to train another dog, so she's hoping to find a working home. I bet breeder is hoping a co-owner can get a good deal of field or agility titles on the dog before she's bred. I know a lot of FCR breeders who's dog's names look like alphabet soup with all the titles. At least for FCRs, the breeders prefer those who compete in field trials rather than just hunters looking for a nice dog. Titles good. :)     Big question is what titles the parents have, and what health tests they've had done. For Labs, you'd want to see OFA (hips, patellas, elbows), CERF, CNM (Centronuclear Myopathy), etc.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	She not looking for just a buyer; She looking for a BUYER of her pups, but  that will be willing to breed the pup in the future-So aka you pay for all the test etc, hip, eye and elbow scores, she just be there for support, Field lines can be crazy, show lines are normally calmer and despite a labrador reputation for crazy, they are NOT suppost to be crazy. there should be relatively plaicid although energetic    So to avoid these pitfalls and choose a good breeder,  look for one who at a minimum:    Keeps dogs in the home as part of the family---not outside  in kennel runs  Has dogs who appear happy and healthy, are excited  to meet new people, and dont shy away from visitors  Shows you where the dogs spend most of their time---  in a clean, well maintained area  Encourages you to spend time with the puppys parents---  at a minimum, the pups mother---when you visit  Only breeds one or two types of dogs and is  knowledgeable about what are called breed standards  (the desired characteristics of the breed, such as size,  proportion, coat, color, and temperament)  Has a strong relationship with a local veterinarian and  shows you records of veterinary visits for the puppies and explains the puppies medical history and what  vaccinations your new puppy will need    Here are more tips on finding a good dog breeder  http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...    red flags  http://dogs.about.com/cs/generalcare/a/b...    other links  http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/faq.htm...  http://www.raot.org/information/10_reaso...  http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/bre...    Dogs that have been uprooted from their happy homes or have not had the best start in life are likely to bond very closely to their new owner.  Yes, dogs that have lost families through death, divorce or lifestyle change can go through a mourning process; however, once they become attached to their new family, they seem to want to please as much as possible to make sure they are never homeless again!  Those dogs that are just learning about the good life and good people seem to bond even deeper. They know what life on the streets, life on the end of a chain, or worse, is about, and they revel and blossom in a nurturing , loving environment. Most rescues make exceptional , extremely loyal companions.    Avoid Newspaper; petstores,puppy mills, classified and online websites such as pennysaver,puppyfind,purebredpups,dog breed info, next day pets etc, they are NOT reputable.|`|W02kTOqmaa	A lot of breeders will co-ownership with a dog that has good show/field potential. They get rights to any of the dog's litters and winnings and so forth. But the owner does the raising, the training, the showing, and they keep the dog.    A dog doesn't have to necessarily be a show dog to be a good breeder. As long as a dog proves itself. labs are hunting dogs, and excel at hunting work. Many kennel clubs do field trials, hunting trials, agility, etc...    A dog that wins field trials is worth just as much as a dog that wins best in breed.     My german shepherd pup comes form a long line of german Schutzhund titled dogs. Schutzhund was a sport created to test and work german shepherds. it has three rounds: obedience, tracking, and protection. In germany, a german shepherd must be titled in schutzhund before it is even allowed to breed.    The breeder, from what i can read, sounds like a decent breeder. Hard to tell from just that, there are MANY other factors to consider. If their labs actually compete in field trial, then at least they are making sure they are worthy to breed|`|26PPwzrWaa	They dont seem that bad based on their ad, the ad in general bugs me though. Most responsible breeders dont advertise their puppies.   and for co ownership, yes breeders do that, especially if the breeder feels it is show potential.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	never heard of this before, but people can ask for about anything|`|K97esxDsaa	Most co-ownership agreements I've seen involve shared ownership between the breeder of a dog or the dog's owner and a handler. The dog may live with either party, and either party may be responsible for the dog's care. It depends on the individual situation.    As to whether or not the breeder is a BYB, they seem fairly legitimate but it's impossible to tell without contacting them. Advertising in the classifieds is a bit iffy, as reputable breeders usually have things like this settled long before the litter is whelped or even conceived.     I would contact them and ask them about their dogs. What field trials or conformation showing they've done, if the dog in question's parents have finished their titles (other dogs in the lineage don't matter; if the breeder tries to tell you the accomplishments of dogs other than the parents, that's a bad sign). It's also very important to make sure the parents have been genetically tested -- NOT A VET CHECKUP. A reputable breeder will have their dogs tested for specific genetic disorders to ensure that they aren't passed on to pups.

Breeder listings for the Chi club    And there is no such thing as a teacup. There are only two variety of chihuahuas and that is long or short hair. ALL well bred chis are to be under 6lbs. There is only one size classification and that is it.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Let's start out by saying "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A "TEACUP" PUPPY".    With that in mind, let me say this; It seems as though there is a plethora of people who are insistent on buying tiny puppies in the 2 to 4 pound range.  Also commonly referred to as a "Teacup puppy".    The word "Teacup" has been used to merely describe the size of a puppy, meaning it is very small and will probably be under the standard size which is 4 to 7 pounds for the Toy Group, Yorkshire Terrier breed. We cannot imagine anyone wanting anything smaller than that!  Their bones are VERY fragile and can be broken by jumping off of a coach, falling off of a bed, being stepped on or worse.    Many breeders, while tacking a whooping price on a puppy, "claim" to breed so called "teacups" as if they were a breed all their own. Don't be fooled! They are NOT a breed of their own.      If a breeder says they specialize in "teacups" RUN, RUN, RUN for the hills! Most "TEACUP" puppies are in reality, a premature puppy.    Most females are bred on the ninth through the fifteenth day of their heat cycles. Eggs can be fertilized for up to 72 hours after any of these breeding's. Therefore, it is possible to have puppies conceived up to a week or so younger than the puppies first conceived in a litter.  However, when the first puppies conceived are mature and ready to be born, labor starts and all the puppies will be born, no matter when they were fertilized.      Some of the problems that may be encountered are both genetic and congenital in these tiny babies and the list is a long one.    The risk of open fontanels (soft spot from the cranial bone not forming), portosystemic shunts (PSS- abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver. As a result the blood is not cleansed by one of the bodies filters: the liver.), hypoglycemia, cardiac problems, collapsing trachea, luxating patellas, Leggs Calves Perthes disease, seizures, hydroencephaly, blindness and digestive problems can be increased in these tiny babies.    Problems such as respiratory problems can remain or worsen throughout their lives. These babies frequently are so fragile that they do not live more than a few years. There have been several tiny Yorkies as adults who still had open fontanels and their owners had to carry nourishment with them all the time. Their vets have felt it unsafe to give a full dose of vaccine so the puppies had to get several injections to be on the safe side.    There is no such thing as a "tea cup" Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, Poodle, or any other breed for that matter.  They simply do not exist. "Tea-cup" is just a marketing ploy given by unethical and unscrupulous breeders to drive up the price of their puppies!      So called "Teacups" fetch anything from $1000 to $10,000! This is ridiculous and shameful! There are a lot of chronically, unhealthy puppies because unscrupulous breeders and puppy mills are inbreeding.  Some poor darlings only live for a very, very short time!    They take the little teeny, tiny Yorkies and they breed 2 1/2 pounders with 3 pounders ... well, theyre playing with genetics. You should NEVER breed a female of any breed less than 5 pounds.    PLEASE educate yourselves before buying a tiny puppy whether it is a Yorkie or any other breed.  You could be in for months or years of heartbreak not to mention staggering veterinarian bills!      DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!  IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PUPPY, DON'T FALL FOR THE TEACUP ACT!    Dogs that have been uprooted from their happy homes or have not had the best start in life are likely to bond very closely to their new owner.  Yes, dogs that have lost families through death, divorce or lifestyle change can go through a mourning process; however, once they become attached to their new family, they seem to want to please as much as possible to make sure they are never homeless again!

Feeding stimulates the defacation response.  Within 1/2 hour place your pet on defecation mat. rub belly.  When defecation takes place - Praise pet.  Repeated application enforces good behaviour.

Gxc98UKMaa	hi              when i got my dog, i had to gain his trust before i could teach him anything. and of course he needs a name that he responds to.        you need plenty of dog treats at hand when training the dog. to teach him to sit is easier than lay down.     what you do is this:     1. hold the treat above his head (not too high) but make sure he cant reach it while on 4 legs.  2. press on his back gently(just in front of the tail) and utter the word "SIT".   3. if he does not sit, press a little harder.   4. when he does sit, praise him, pat him on the back and give him the treat.    You should do this every day, but do not do it for over 5 minutes a day.     do the same for lay down. use the command down.     1 get him to sit.    2 hold the treat on the ground (dont let him have it)     3. while he is sitting, pull his front paws forward gently until he is lying down and say "DOWN".      this may take a while to learn, as he might try to get up when u pull his paws    4. praise him and give him the treat.    Remember not to do too teaching at once.     always praise and pat him whether he obeys u or not    this is important as they need encouragement just like children.      hope this helps.      PS if this fails u can always take him to Puppy preschool|`|YRTYXfggaa	I know this sounds crazy, but I rescued a dog who was weary of having his legs touched and a bit on the shy side.  I have trained many dogs, but this one was a little more challenging.  So, I used reverse doggy psychology.  Whenever I would catch him sitting or lying down, I would praise him and say "good sit" and give him a treat.  He would get all excited, because I was, and then I would go about my business.  I did it several times a day, until he would actually come up to me and sit, waiting for a treat.  That's when he got the most praise.  I then combined it with down, stay, come, and shake, eventually being able to touch his feet!  Dog's are smarter than you think!  Your dog is listening to you, you just don't know how to communicate with him!|`|iVQULHqYaa	Remember that your dog cannot speak English and he will never have a large vocabulary. You need to tempt him and lure him into these positions.Cut up some treats, cheese, hot dogs or bagged cooked chicken from Iceland. Treats like this are cheaper than manufactured treats,contain fewer additives and your dog will love them.. Never use your dogs name when you ask it to either sit or down as this will encourage it to come forward. Never  say "sit down" the command is either sit or down. Do not confuse your dog by adding other words to this command like "for goodness sake sit"  TO GET YOUR DOG TO SIT.If your dog is small,  sit on the floor and put the treat towards your dogs nose,raise your hand up and the dogs nose will follow your hand and sit, praise your dog and give it the treat. Stroke your dog gently whilst he is sitting and release him by saying O.K. Do not continue praising after your dog is released and don't attempt downs in the same training session. Do a few more sits and play with your dog. THE DOWN. Again with a treat in your hand, put the treat towards the dogs nose and move your hand towards the floor, your dog will follow this and go down. Give him the treat, stoke and praise your dog then give him the release command (OK) you must not continue praise after you release him as he will then think that he is being praised for getting up.|`|y3gDqFobaa	hold a treat and he will pay attention but he might not lission|`|BGjzFrjtaa	give him a reward every time he sits even if he does it while you dont ask him but before you give it to him say SIT. then say good boy and he is going to want more of the treat and just keep saying sit till he does it and dont give it to him if he dosent do it. he will eventualy know what to do. but remember to give him the treat and also play cute with him.
0ef3O2m6aa	A resection of the dogs ear is done in cases of extreme infections.  The membranes swell and remain that way from scar tissue which doesn't allow air flow through the ear.  The resection surgery  allows this again and allows the dog to hear.  Yes, it is stinky.  The ear drops should be working though...if not your vet needs to know so he or she can reasses the situation.  2weeks for stiches is normal.      Most dogs with chronic ear problems have underlying allergies.  Maybe it would be helpful to switch to a corn, gluten and by product free food.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Are you cleaning it properly?  Two weeks is right for stitches.  Cleaning it with a soft cloth, warm water and hydrogen peroxide should eliminate the smell.  Infections do stink, but they should die down after the antibiotics kick in.  You did get antibiotics... right?
JwYwsrTzaa	Because of the breeds, I would suggest you hire a professional trainer to help you introduce the dogs. In addition, both dogs need to be neutered. Intact males are responsible for the majority of dog attacks.    If the dogs do not get along, I really recommend you find another place to live. Two intact males fighting could lead to some serious injuries and vet bills or worse.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Any time you have two un-neutered males in a home, they will more than likely fight. All that testosterone makes them crazy to prove dominance. Especially if there is a female nearby (not necessarily in the same house - some male dogs will fight to the death if allowed.)    You need to have BOTH dogs neutered before you could try to re-introduce them. Then do so on neutral grounds, like in a park. However neutering will not "cure" bad manners or learned/inherited aggression. It will reduce the amount of hormones that drive male dogs wild, but training will also have to be a big part of it.    I would bring in a behaviorist to work with both dogs. You cannot always MAKE two dogs get along but a behaviorist may be able to help at least make it more tolerable and safe.|`|YNdcFlulaa	don't give them treats or they might fight over it.  just pet both of them and make them have bonding time.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Introduce them outside of the house where the dominant dog lives.  Like in a dog park.  Then take them to the house where they will both be living.  It's a dominance issue.  They'll get over it!|`|5PsKGss7aa	are they males and not neutered? if so, get them neutered, two males intact will tend to fight..  If they are both fixed then it will probably take awhile to get them used to each other since the other dog thinks its his "castle" sort to speak & you'll have to take it ETREMEMLY slow..      ADD:  You NEED to get them neutred in this case.        .

Or put up a notice saying that the field near your apartment is being regularly treated with weed killer. You could also get your husband to fill a large container with water and let your neighbours see him spraying the grass around your apartment. This will add credence to the notice as they will think that this is weed killer or some other dangerous substance.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	I would think it would be up to the management to keep the grounds clean and in order,maybe if someone falls and gets hurt and sues the property owners they will wake up? Untill then your neighbors know it is you that hates the poo so if you put it on their porches they will know who did it and you will have a real mess to deal with and you have to live there so I don't think that is such a good idea.can you put up a sort of temporary plastic fence in your area to keep them out? Home Depot carries them, but then again-- that may tick them off and cause more problems. Maybe finding another place to live in the near future.

AA11457471	No, it's not a coincidence but the food is not to blame, either. My educated guess is that now that he's feeling better, he's got a lusher hair coat & grooming himself better, too = more hairballs.  It would be a good idea to get a metal comb & thoroughly comb him through a couple times a week.  Also, Laxatone & Cat Lax are both very effective products that can be bought at most pet stores.  I also keep a container of cat (wheat) grass for my cats to munch on. I get it at the produce store but most health food stores carry it, too.|`|4aAhEK9daa	No - lack of grooming is to blame.  It's Springtime and cats are shedding their winter coats.  You need to brush your cat to remove the loose hair so he doesn't swallow it.  If this is a longhaired cat use a comb.  Brushes do little to remove the loose hairs of the undercoat in longhaired cats.|`|F6jjZEctaa	There are cat foods with hair ball control in it .|`|RYDwwTITaa	Umm, it's hard to say if it's the food or not. But i had a cat that would have these horrible hairballs everyday. To solve it, we bought her this Hairball Remedy stuff that you can probably buy from a local pet store. It's like a paste and supposed to taste like fish. My cat loved it, and what do you know? It solved the hairball problem as well.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	I give my cat a hairball remedy food and brush him faithfully. He also goes into the back yard occasionally to eat grass which helps him pass the hairballs.|`|u4rHgRWdaa	I am a huge cat person and I know everything about cats. Yes, the food may have a slight side effect to causing the hairballs, but once your cat system has got use to it you should be furball clean. Also check to see if your cat is cleaning himself more, now that he is more active, he would get dirty more and he would clean himself more which means he would have furballs. :) Hope that helps!|`|0BbeU5Z7aa	yes|`|E5HAzKYHaa	Just make sure hes drinking enough water.  My 16 yr old cat used to have hairballs all the time at least once a week.  We gave him a bigger water dish and they seemed to have lessened to once a month.  Im guessing just having a more lubricated throat helped them get down better maybe?  Good luck.|`|3Y1ondDraa	He probably doesn't like the after taste and chooses to lick himself to get rid of it. Hence the hair in his mouth and throat causing the hairballs.|`|oSxgDvUraa	I'm not an expert, except that I have two long haired cats myself.  They only get hairballs from eating their own hair I think, so I can't imagine the food would matter, though I have seen "hairball" formula foods.  Maybe his new food is making his hair grow more and then shed?  But you should try the over the counter hairball medicines, it's like a gel in a tube that you feed them.|`|hPhQkT79aa	Maybe changing food is to blame. Cats get hairball from grooming himself. Maybe the food that you feed him causes his fur to change. Try to change his food back and lets see what happen.|`|2appxifoaa	no|`|3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	Start brushing him every day and get some petromalt for him. If he won't take it from your fingertip, smear it on one of his front paws so he'll be forced to lick it off. Only take him to the vet if the grooming and the petromalt don't effect any changes within 2 weeks.|`|2lr92gVgaa	Overweight cats generally don't groom themselves very well because they can't reach all areas.  Now that your cat has lost weight he is able to groom himself better, hence, he is ingesting more of his hair and getting hairballs.  You can try Laxatone or other hairball remedy paste.  Just follow directions on the tube and if it's just from ingesting too much hair this should solve the problem.  If he continues to have problems, the vet should be seen as he could have a problem with his intestines or he could have a hairball that is too large or impacted for him to pass, especially if he is an older cat.  I have had this same problem with my cat and a dose of the hairball paste twice a week keeps her good now.
g4I23UItaa	7 gallons is too small for koi.    kOi keeper & goldfish keeper.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Youll need a filter for whatever tank you end up buying. There is no such thing as a small koi. There is however and baby koi. Koi are a type of carp, and carp can grow to 3 feet.    A proper aquarium setup is going to cost you 150-200 dollars for a small on even.    I believe your son would be better off with a different pet. Fish have more care than most other small animals, believe it or not. If their water isnt right, they can get sick. You need to constantly check your water and perform weekly maintenance just so the fish stays healthy.    Look into mice/rats/hamsters... Basically, any small rodent. You can get a proper setup for them for about 40 bucks. And most of them cost less than 10 dollars. Their care is nowhere near what fish require.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Koi get big quick, so that would never work, they need lots of space, even when small.  If you are looking for small, cheap cold water fish I'd check out the Cloud mountain minnow.  They can actually be very pretty.  Other cold water fish wouldn't be able to live in such  small container for long.    Goldfish produce a great deal of waste and have to have a great filter and much more space to be really healthy, you'd be changing the water every other day manually without one.  Check out craiglist and ebay for cheap aquarium sets, there's some good deals on there. : )  Best of Luck!|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Most important thing about fish keeping is you need to set up the correct environment in the aquarium, temperature, filtering etc.    As long as you can set up and maintain a tank correctly then most common fish are relatively easy to care for. The wrong tank setup - problems every time    A 7gal pot is pushing things, not impossible, but VERY limited as to what can live in it, and the small fish you can keep may hardly be seen from the surface of the container.    Best option, look around for a 2nd hand tank. They often come up cheap, something at least 20gals if you want to keep goldfish.     A smaller tank, White Cloud Minnows are a good option. They could technically live in a 7gal tub, but they are a bit small and un-intersting as a pond fish.    But yes you can set up and run an aquarium on a budget, but get the biggest tank you can, and keep it simple.    Ian|`|APxHOFG4aa	Fish are hard to take care of and beginners shouldn't get a small tank. Smaller tanks hold less water and the less water, the more  any mistake in water chemistry can hurt you. We had 2 tanks in our aquatic science class and we killed half the fish in the ten gallon 1 over 6 month but hardly killed any in the      Koi wouldn't be good for a 7 gal pot. Even smaller goldfish need alot of water because of all the ammonia they produce.    Has your son told you he wanted fish? Are you sure he could keep up with maintenance of filters and cleaning? What if he wants something he can touch and play with? Rats are really smart rodents and can sometimes learn their name and to play fetch, I read an article on some rats they were teaching to sniff out mines because they're lighter than german shepherds. I wouldn't get a gerbil because if you don't have a pair, they get mean.    You should research other pets, and if he does want fish, you need to let him know about all the responsibility besides feeding. Fish can be very expensive, when our class bought the tanks they were hundreds of dollars. The tank stands would have been alot more, too, if we didn't keep the tanks on a counter top. ordinary furniture can't handle the weight.|`|eqTrMY1Vaa	I definitely recommend a goldfish. You could also try a small guppy pond, but you are going to need to get some plants for oxygen, etc. Do a google for guppy ponds and you can see the possible set-ups if you think that sounds like what you want. Goldfish are definitely the easiest and hardiest. Plus either way, you could save some fish from being fish food for a carnivore and get them cheap.|`|wnnudNp5aa	If you don't have experience in fish keeping, get some books from a pet store, book store, or your local library, and read up about it. You should never undertake keeping a new kind of pet without learning about it. As has already been said, there is no such thing as small koi, and a garden pot is not really a suitable home for fish. If, after reading up on the requirements of fish keeping, you wish to pursue it, you can often find second hand aquariums in your local classified ads, or on Craig's list, or other sales/trading sites.  My parents got me a hamster when I was a kid. Easy to care for, small cash investment, and a lot of fun.
rQlzfHqraa	The following site has incubators for chickens down to quails. I've had three different ones but you should choose for yourself.|`|jS6Qkj0faa	in reality the best incubator for chickens is a mother hen. you can turn the eggs manually and they need to be kept humid as well though.
XmJZkFuMaa	We feed Taste of the Wild Prairie formula.  It's a no-grain formula that is actually cheaper than a lot of foods, but nutritionally it's very sound.      I had to learn basic dog nutrition when I was interning, so I tend to look at dog foods by their ingredients and judge them that way.  I have no problem moving to a new one if the formula changes so it doesn't look as good (like what Canidae did recently.)

I am hoping a breeder did not breed the mixes, although my feeling says the breed got these pups from elsewhere. Kind of like a person I know that bought a neo from a breeder and that breeder ended up with a litter of neo/bloodhound mixes.     Since your dog has a giant breed in him, you want to stick with a dog food that contains 23% protein or less. Highest you want to go is 25% for Taste of the wild pacific stream.     Good brands you can go for to keep your dogs growth slow:   Wellness(the formula with 22% protein)  Solid gold mmelinia  innova  blue buffalo  Eagle pack holistic(not to be conf. with reg eagle pack)    Orijen and other grain free foods with high protein content need to be avoided until 2 years of age. When growing stops. Fixing should also be done after 9 months of age min in my opinion to help prevent growth issues. I always wait until 18 months of age min. Preferably 24 months.

DuLhv7Ajaa	3 years old is getting up there in age for a rat. Try mixing a little honey in her food and that may kick start her appetite again. Depending on what type of rat she is though there may not be a lot you can do. I've owned many rats over the years and my English Blues never lived beyond 2 1/2 years neither did my Dumbos. However my good old plain white rats lived anywhere from 3-5 years.|`|oGVWdnHraa	If you have any "egg and biscuit" (its a type of bird food that you add water to, to make a paste) feed her that, its a great way to get rats eating again because its tasty and easy to eat :) Good luck and I hope she gets better :)|`|W96dJEPfaa	You need to encourage her to eat by offering her soft yummy foods. Sweetcorn is always a favourite of mine. Baby food is good too and full of energy to keep her strength up.    There's also a product called Nutrical you can give her. It comes in a tube and is a high calorie paste that's really tasty. My rats go crazy for it, but they only get it when they're poorly to keep their calorie intake up.    It might be worth discussing with your vet the possibility of heart and/or kidney disease. Both can cause rapid weight loss but are treatable wih a drug called Fortekor or Prillium (Prillium is the liquid version).    Some vets won't prescribe this because it isn't licensed for rats, but many will so if yours won't, you should try and find another vet who is willing to try new things.    It's so hard finding a good rat vet who will give something other than Baytril!    If it's the kidneys you can buy something called Ipakitine to sprinkle on top of their wet food. It helps take the strain off the kidneys.|`|x4Vd6Tvhaa	it may sound weird but start feeding your rat people food. since they are scavengers by nature they love it and i found the ones that i feed human food to rather than just rat food and treats lived longer and were much healthier. i had one who lived to be 6 he went everywhere with me and ate whatever i ate. he was the best rat ever lol. and they can pretty much eat anything mine loved french fries :)

Now what it is they dream of only they know.|`|60GmMBr7aa	I know they dream so it is very possible. maybe she hasn't been getting enough attention (if she's not fixed she might be going to go into heat if it is a girl)|`|u23sua9daa	Yes i believe that cats and dogs do dream.|`|C1THzzm8aa	well i have never been one..... so i really don't know|`|MMf19oI9aa	sure they can|`|71iHxtWLaa	Probably, because they have dreams. Ever notice when your kitty is sleeping they sometimes twitch their paws and faces? They're haveing a dream. So it's certainly possible they can have scary dreams too.|`|C1TtblD0aa	i think they can coz my dog whimpers at night sometimes
c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	This is called PICA, which is the characteristic of cats eating things that are not food. Vets don't all agree on what causes some cats to do this. Many believe it is because of anemia or mineral deficiencies. Below I have linked a couple of sites about it, if you want to read more.    I have a cat that does that too. He will eat any old weird little thing on the floor, like a small piece of plastic from a wrapper, a dead leaf off of someone's shoe, etc. and I have found the only way to prevent it is to keep the floor vaccuumed very well.     Keep an eye on your cat and make sure they seem OK. Ingesting foreign objects can cause problems, it just depends on what it is and where it gets stuck. But it is also very common for them to eat and poop out small bits of flexible plastic or wrappers without any problem. If you are really concerned and something seems wrong with the cat, you'd be wise to take them to the vet.     Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=|`|AA11457471	I have a cat that eats all kinds of weird stuff- drives me crazy! It's amazing what will pass through their systems. I've even found a dryer sheet in the litterbox.   If no one's vomiting now & they're eating & drinking & acting okay they'll be fine.   If you see more vomit separate them so you can see who's sick & get that one to the vet first thing in the morning.|`|u23sua9daa	Take both of your cats to the vet.
EeJMITyCaa	Give her time to digest the food dang lol|`|AA11457471	If she's got a mom leave her alone. It's a change & her body needs to adjust.

It takes a day or 2 to go through your body and out your butt! lol. Give it a day. I dont think when you eat food you go flying to the toilet straight away. lol. :)|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	At 3 weeks, you may have to play "mama dog" for her. Het a paper towel or a terry cloth towel... dampen it with warm water, then make it like a "mama's tongue." Stroke her belly with the warm, wet towel, like you are licking her belly... this should stimulate her to poop. When she begins to poop, continue the licking motion on her anus, to collect all the poop.     I had to do this with a tiny feral kitten I once rescued (now he's a fat, lovable cat).  Also, be sure and get this little girl to the vet ASAP, so that the vet can advise you further on the care of this pup.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	take her for a walk. Did you say three weeks. isn't that too young to be on solid food?    Just in case you miss typed the age. Take the dog for a walk or a quick jog. My puppy is 8ish weeks and we just take her running to the corner, she loves to chase us. nad before we get past a block she has ventured off to poop. The exercise makes them go.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	3week is very young for dog food-   I'd try using a warm wet wash cloth to rub the stomach to see it the food will move through more easily|`|vAH98IE2aa	Ok First off 3weeks is Too young to be giving Solid food, They do not start on solid food til 6 weeks You Must let the mother feed if she will not or is not available then buy some puppy formula follow the directions and hand feed with a bottle you can purchase from the pharmacy or your local vet. Now for the momment to help... This is really going to gross you out When a puppy is being fed by her mother The mother Licks Their bottoms Not their bellies Their BumsTo help Aid them in using the "Bathroom" If your Puppy Does Not Have a bowl movement in 6 to 8 hrs Then First try Holding the pups rectum over steam from Hot water NOT Boiling Just Hot from the tap, Hold the pup about 12 inches above the water And Rub his/her Bum With a warm wet Disposable rag. This often helps If Not then you can try and give the pup One of the following High fiber diet,  Or you can seek a vet and try Oral Osmotic or Emollient laxatives they will weigh the pup and administer accordingly Pups Go More often than we do So do not pay attention to the silliness of those going on their own bowl problems as it does not take Days Nor 24 hrs for a 6week pup let alone a 3 WEEK old pup. and it can become very serious if Not treated Please people remember to do your resaerch before Risking a life, Don't answer if you do not know and Don't belittle some ones concern. Concern is good and there are NO dumb quesions especially when you are concerned for a life! Please Ensure that the pup is seen by a vet to ensure he/she is ok The nutrients in solid food can be harmful for a pup of that age. Hope this helps you.. CSR
25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	the vet you are taking him to later this morning should have a vet on call. call the office, an answering service should answer, or an answering machine with instructions on who to call.|`|AA11457471	If he's in that much pain he needs to go to the emergency vet. The crystals have probably blocked his urethra so he can't pee at all. This is a life threatening emergency that cannot be treated at home!  After you get this treated you need to ask your vet about prescription food for cats with crystals.    Add: Look in the phone book yellow pages under "veterinarian". Get off the computer & get going. Wake someone up that can drive!!!|`|KcwF3yhLaa	Take him 2 the vet ASAP!!!!!!!!!|`|u4rHgRWdaa	Im sorry mate, but if your cat has crystals, like the last lady said, your cat has a potentioally life threatening injury. Your cat could die within afew hours, I hate to tell you that. Any vet will do the job. Hurry. I hope all goes well. Imagine you not being able to pee. That would hurt so much.|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	This is a life threatening emergency for your cat!!! If he is acting that badly, then his urethra is probably so blocked that he can't pee. This can kill him VERY QUICKLY. Please, get out your phone book, and read in the yellow pages for numbers of vets. Look at all the ads and see if any of them say anything about emergency service. Even if none of the ads say that, just start calling vets numbers and listen to their answering service or machine to see if they say who else you can call for an emergency. I have lived in many small towns, and there is always an emergency vet within an hour or less driving distance. An hour may seem like a long drive for some people, but isn't the life of your cat worth that? If you can't drive, see if you can find a family member, friend, or good neighbor who can help and give you a ride. If all else fails, you can call a taxi. They are expensive, but if it were my cat I would spare no expense.     By the way, UTI in cats is caused by ingredients (mainly magnesium and ash) in poor quality cat foods that some cats cannot ingest without reactions this way, and they dont need it in their diet  at all. If your cat makes it, get into the habit of reading the ingredients on the label of the cat food bag, and don't buy anything with magnesium and ash in it. There are a number of good cat foods that are made just for cats that need a special diet for urinary tract health. I have had cats with this problem, and once I found the right food, the UTI's stopped for good.     Please, look in your phone book and start calling  vet's numbers. Dont let your poor kitty suffer. He may not make it till the morning!!    Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=
iJtuhLMTaa	It would have to be a non-native species (ie a Europiean Eagle Owl  as one example)  native species of owls are controled under the migratory bird treaty act and cannot be kept excpet by special permit (for falconry, breeding, rehab or education)    Yes those species that can legally be kept can be purchased though you would have to search to find a breeder.    However that said...owls do not make good pets.   Owls or any raptor for that matter are not like keeping other pet birds.  They need much more sepecialized care and housing and few people are equipt to properly care for them
tE7lqUfoaa	maybe shes ill  or it might just be that shes getting old|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Older cats are prone to get hyperthyroid. Yowling in the night is a common symptom. Take her to the vet to be properly medicated for this problem.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	It's a sign of illness or failing senses. Our old cat started doing this and unfortunately we put it down to old age or her developing deafness but didn't realise until way too late that she was extremely sick and had to put her down the day after we realised there was something wrong.     Take her to the vet and get them to make a thorough investigation, ears, nose, eyes, teeth, gums, temperature, xray all that.     In fact when we took our cat to the vet she suddenly seemed to get better and the vet put her back in the carrier ready to go home after saying she was okay and she collapsed. They took an xray and her entire left lung was filled with fluid.     Any sign of behaviour change could signify something minor (like hearing loss) or something really serious, so don't leave it to chance.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Is this sudden?  Could she be in pain?  Or is she just a talkative cat?  We had one who would start as soon as he walked in the door.  Later on he had a hormonal imbalance where he lost all his hair, but before that, the vet could find nothing wrong.    I wonder, in view of her age she might have a kidney problem.  That is often the case with older cats.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	pain? sick?  dementia?    try taking her to a vet.|`|RcvzWBraaa	It could be because she's getting old.

She just does this to get attention from me. Perhaps this is what your cat is doing too. I too have more than one cat, but often the cat that does the loud meowing wants attention from me, not the other cat. I taught her to stop it by just saying "No" or "Stop" in a firm voice. If I pet her or pay attention to her in a positive way, she will just keep doing it in the future.|`|u4rHgRWdaa	lol. Do you let her outside? I know heaps about cats, and its normal. Its all depening. There are heaps of things. Example. She could have a mate (is she de-s e x e d?). But, with our cats, the usual case is that she has caught a mouse. They call for you to see the achievement they have accomplished and then you pat them. She could maybe be in some sort of pain if she is usually inside. Maybe arthritis. If you need any otha info on cats just ask me. :)|`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	Maybe she is going deaf and thinks that's the normal level.

They obviously weren't ill, because they lived healthy and happy lives, and were 20 and 21 when they finally died.  It used to worry me, exactly the same as it does you, but I'm afraid I cannot provide an explanation. I'm sorry.  As long as you can satisfy yourself that she's happy, healthy and well fed (as you're obviously already doing) I'm afraid there's not much more you can do x|`|oKrXOwyKaa	It could be an asthma attack ,check if she has a rapid breathing and she has produce colors in her gum(animals do have asthma attack).

BDRIeLqUaa	I'd take her to the vet and see if they can tell if she is expecting  some dogs become very odd in behavior during this time|`|L6C66lAJaa	Well, not to scare you, but if you used Sergants products on them, thats not a good thing. It has been known to impair vision in animals, and they really cant recognize the other dog. If you did use this, call your vet ASAP! Its odd to me that she wouldn't recognize his scent, because the shampoo wouldnt affect this much. If she is pregnant, then she doesn't want anything to do with him, then that is normal. Either way you should call your vet. Good luck. Sorry I couldn't be more help.
XurYYreBaa	I'm so sorry that you've lost your rat & I know how frustrating it is when they seem to be getting better but go downhill instead.  Give your other rat as much attention as possible, he's probably grieving too.  If you can't adopt another rat, be there as much as you can for the one you have.  Don't blame yourself for what happened. Virtually *all* pet rats have the organism that causes mycoplasma.  Sometimes the rat is lucky enough to live his or her life without having a flare-up but some rats have weaker immune systems & will flare no matter how well they're cared for.  There are things you can do to reduce the chance that your rat will have a flare up.  Don't use cedar or pine bedding, keep the habitat clean & dust-free, feed the healthiest food possible & try to keep your rat free from stress.  Also, it's important to see a vet quickly if a flare up does occur.  Sometimes things go wrong no matter how careful you are.  We had a female who we rescues from a feeder bin & she surprised us with 5 pups 2 weeks later.  We battled mycoplasma flare ups for the entire lives of mama rat & her pups.  Some of the babies didn't survive their 1st year & even though some lived for over 2 yrs it was an ongoing struggle & we made several trips to the vet.  None of the rats we've adopted from the rodent rescue or through a breeder have *ever* had a mycoplasma flare up, but we've had very mixed experiences with rats from pet stores, especially feeder rats.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell you the truth, of all the rats I've owned there was one (plain white rat) that was my favorite. He went with me everywhere on my shoulder, he would come when I called him, and he would sleep all night curled up next to my ear. When he died I cried for 2 weeks, but as time went on it hurt less and less. If your sad that's OK, and if you need to cry than do it. Its not silly or lame to be sad when a pet you love dies.  The best thing you can do is spend time with your other rat, give him lots of attention, and be his companion. He can end up being a very good pet even though he's the only one in the cage.|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Be your lonely rat's best buddy. Spend a lot of time with it... soon he will bond to you. My first pet rat was a lone rat, and she was an awesome little companion. After she died, I adopted 2 ratties, but they clung more to each other than to me... I kind of missed that bond I had with just the one. So, YOU be that rattie's best friend, now. Let him ride on your shoulder. Hold on to him, rub his ears, give him treats... talk to him...  Enjoy him.|`|po62AbPqaa	very sorry to hear that sad new...it is always too too sad to lose our dear little faithful friends    most rats are born with myco...some just never express any symptoms    and apparently the myco free strains are the result of ceasarian birth.    I have a baby at the moment with myco and a secondary infection. she is eating, growing, active and playful but you never know with rats...they can go suddenly     my little girl is on two types of antibiotics, which is a common vet practise for myco...baytril and doxycyline...twice daily...which is what you will probably need for your other ratty if he starts showing symptoms, eg porphyrin, coughing, sneezing, wheezing, off food, lethargic etc    but...he might be ok...just watch him closely for any sign of illness    and yes...his health has a better chance if he has a friend. I would look for two baby litter mates or else find an older one from a rat rescue in your area...google rat rescue to find the nearest    the reason Id get two if you decide to get a young rat is because litter mates are great life friends and as your rat is older you will be faced with a lonely rat again in the future...2 babies means that they hopefully will have each other longer    rats in laboratories are no longer allowed to be housed singly...as it degrades their health (MORE vet bills and health problems to deal with so this is a good point to share with say your dad) and they die younger so they now must have at least one cage mate for their health    rats need others to snuggle up to, practise their hairdressing skills on, play chasey will and mock fight and battle with and just generally be best friends and company    but as your dad has said NO, then it will be difficult to convince him that your remaining rat needs a companion for its health and quality of life, but you need to go about it in a non hassling and responsible way    I will give you some links to information that you could share with your dad...you know, once a rat lover then it is likely to be a lifetime love affair...they are the cutests, funniest, most intelligent, downright adorable small pets    they are at least as intelligent as dogs, can be very affectionate once they trust their owner, can learn their name, be toilet trained, do tricks on command...and are just a heap of fun!!!    very good luck with it...I am always so sad to hear that a ratty has lost its cage friend...they really suffer the loss    look here  http://www.rmca.org/Resources/apair.txt|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Aaaw ;( I'm sorry to hear about your loss, it's horrible when you loose a pet, especial one with such a character and personality, like rats have. You'll soon cope, just concentrate on the rat you still have.    I don't know much about myctoplasma, i've owned 15 rats over the past years, and not one of them have suffered from myctoplasma so it's probably not that common, and i doubt your other rat will get this.   Don't worry, your remaining rat can't really get ill just because he's on his own, but sometimes when rats do suddenly loose their cage mate, they can be a bit weird for one or two days. Just give your rat a lot of attention and cuddles, and he'll be OK.  I've had quite a few rats who were left on their own after their brother or sister died, and after a few days, they seemed OK, and on those occasions i didn't really concider getting another rats because the remaining rat was fairly old, too.   If your other rat is still not that old, you could concider getting another. But if you feel he's too old, and that it's not worth it, then don't worry, your rat will be OK with lots of attention!  I'm sorry about your other rat :(  ~Good luck~  
9kTejB0uaa	To be honest, this sounds far from normal, and I don't like the excessive bleeding situation.  If they were concerned, I don't think she should have been discharged.  I prefer to bring my recovering hounds home asap because dogs do recover faster in their own homes, but I'm (reasonably, after over 35 years!!) knowledgeable and know when things are not right!!  The time frame for discharge (surgery at 10 and home at 3) is fine, provided they are satisfied she's well enough to go home.  But I don't like it that they told you to remove the bandages etc. (or that she was bandaged at all!)   That's unusual to say the least.    I think you should at least speak to the vet about your concerns although perhaps taking her back in the car may do more harm than good, unless it's absolutely necessary.  She needs rest, warmth, and quite at the moment.  Pain-wise, they should have given her a pain relief shot, which will take care of any discomfort for about 24 hours.  Did they give you any more?    Peeing - well if she had nil by mouth the evening before the surgery, and has only taken in a wee spot of water, it won't be essential that she needs to go, but I'd watch that.    Bottom line - be advised by your vet!|`|oGVWdnHraa	I havent got any advice for you, but I gave you a star so my contacts could see as most of them are very knowledgable on subjects like these :) Good luck with your dog and I hope she gets better :)|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	If she seems bloated, worse case scenario, there may be a buildup of blood under her skin...For her to actually have blood on the incision tell me that the vet did NOT do a test for thin or "bleeder" blood before the procedure...  I really don't want to worry you but you seriously need to contact the vet like NOW...If you can't get ahold of your vet, please call an er vet..  I seriously don't want to worry you, but I'm worried myself...Call te vet, o.k. ?|`|IUi6mDJcaa	Thats strange that there was a bandage around her waist. Swelling is not normal at all especially after a spay. There's a chance they could have put the bandage on too tight or there's an underlying problem associated with the spay. She should be urinating normally as well. You should take her to the nearest 24 hour vet in your area and have them look at her. Whatever's wrong could get worse.|`|YNdcFlulaa	yeah|`|BDRIeLqUaa	more info is needed, how old is the dog, has she been thru heat cycles- was she in heat at this time?  all pets are different, some of us have blood that clots fast- and others have blood that does not  the belly wrap is used to apply extra pressure to the incision line to add the blood in clotting  nobody knows her better then you- if you need to feel more safe- take her in.  We ask our dogs to be so tough- after a hysterectomy on me- I will be in the hospital for at least 2 days

Every puppy/dog gets them at some point. You need to take him to the vet so he can get you a de-wormer. NEVERRRRRR buy any over the counter de-wormer or flea tick thing theyre all bad. Get that stuff from your vet|`|gUsJlTvKaa	It sounds like Tape Worm. You need to treat them with a good wormer such as drontal. When they are a puppy at this age they need to have worming done monthly. When they get older its every 3 months. You probally notice that the puppy has a bit of a big belly and that is also caused by having the worms in there. Worms are something you want to treat straight away because they are basically fighting with the puppy to who is going to get all the good things from puppy food like protein. So the puppy is missing out on alot of that.
5PsKGss7aa	If he isn't neutered, that may help. I had  a chihuahua that made little accidents in the house and after he got neutered, he stopped.  But if yours is fixed then I cant help you too much for that...as Ive never had musch problems with ours.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Why on earth did you ever get a puppy who was only 5 weeks old? That was too young to leave mum.    I have a Bichon Frise... they ARE known to be difficult to house train. A lot of small dogs are harder to house train because they have smaller bladders.     Its not good just letting your dog outside and hoping he will pee out there. You need a regular routine of taking him out for walks... as well as putting him out as soon as he starts sniffing round and looks like he needs a wee.    You have to go back to basics. I shall paste in infro from a very good leaflet.     House-training an adult dog  Through no fault of their own, some pet dogs reach adulthood without being fully house trained. Fortunately, with time and patience, it is possible to establish new habits and teach your dog to stay clean in the house.  Not all dogs are house trained  Although it is quite easy to house train a puppy, things can and do go wrong with this process if not carried out correctly. With some dogs, it may not have been attempted at all if, for example, they were kennelled outside. Consequently, some pet dogs reach adulthood having not been fully house trained. Luckily, in most cases, it is a simple matter to house train an adult dog and new habits can be established quickly. However, it does require time and patience, and a dedicated owner determined to succeed. How long it takes depends on:  how well the owner keeps to the routine   how quickly the dog learns   how old your dog is   what experience your dog has had in the past                          Other reasons for not being clean in the house  As well as not being house trained, there are many other reasons why a dog will go to the toilet in the house. Some of these are:  stress and tension in the household   anxiety about being left alone   territory marking   Symptoms of lack of house training  Usually just a few areas in the house are used as the toilet. These are usually near the exit or entry points of the rooms used and the dog will return to these sites again and again.     Some dogs may urinate and defecate in the house, or urinate in the house only and defecate outside, while others will defecate in the house but not urinate. Usually, but not always, the dog will sneak away to go to the toilet, rather than go in front of humans. The dog may do this at any time, not just when left alone in the house.  Even after a walk, the dog may come back to the house and go to the toilet.  What to do  Before starting the new routine  Carefully clean all areas your dog has previously soiled using a warm solution of biological washing powder (for example, a teaspoon of powder dissolved in a cup of warm water) or a specially formulated product from your vet, which will remove all traces of the smell from your house.  Every day  When you first wake up, last thing at night and every hour during the day, take your dog outside to a place in your garden that you have chosen and let your dog walk up and down or run about and sniff the area (both exercise and sniffing helps stimulate elimination).     Put soiled newspaper or faeces in this area so that the smell tells your dog where to go next time. Stay out with your dog and patiently walk up and down for at least five minutes. If your dog starts to go to the toilet, give praise. It is important that, for the first two weeks, there is constant supervision so that your dog cannot go to the toilet in the house.     During the times that you cannot supervise your dog or when you go to sleep, confine the dog to bed. You need to find a suitable way to do this, either by restricting them to bed with a barrier, or investing in an indoor kennel. A dog will become accustomed to this, without making a noise or trying to break out, when left there for short periods of time.     Few dogs soil their own bed and, if confined to bed, they are unlikely to relieve themselves. Although it is unfair to confine them for long periods, this does provide a way of preventing them from soiling the house for short periods when you cannot supervise. This avoids perpetuating bad habits at times when you need to concentrate on other things.     Between trips to the garden, supervise your dog continually when in the house. This means keeping your dog in view at all times and being aware of what the dog is doing. When unable to supervise, confine them to bed, but do not leave your dog there for long periods of time.  When you see your dog about to toilet in the house  If about to go to the toilet indoors, take your dog immediately to your chosen place in the garden and praise the dog by giving a food treat or a game with a favourite toy. It is essential your dog associates going to that place with a reward. Catching in time means your dog will still need to go. Wait until the dog has performed and praise well.  When you find a puddle or mess  Do not punish your dog for any accidents discovered too late. It may make you feel better but it is most unpleasant for|`|9kTejB0uaa	Hum.  Did you buy a crate when you first had your puppy?  (yoiks, 5 weeks is way too young for him to go out into the world on his own, but that's all too late).  Provided he has no medical problems (it is important to make sure because no amount of correction will help if he has a problem), this lad has to learn - and fast!  If you haven't been using a crate, get one, cover the top and three sides, and leave the door open to begin with.  Put his bed, toys, and feed him in there.  Obviously shut him in at night.  You have to go right back to basics (cut out the training mats etc.etc. - he has to learn to GO OUTSIDE).  Put him out when he first wakes up, after food, after a significant period of playtime)   Go outside WITH him and say the word (pee-pee, or whatever).  If he doesn't go, bring him in and put him right into his crate, shut the door.  Leave him for say half an hour and then put him outside again.  When he has a mistake, don't be rough with him, but make him aware you are far from impressed.  Clean it up thoroughly etc.    You might consider having him castrated if he's 'marking'.  This won't improve things immediately however because it takes time for the hormones to settle down, but it may well help.    At a year, his bladder is well capable of 'holding'.  He just has to know this is what he's meant to be doing!!|`|6Ur0KEHQaa	you could always go to puppy training classes...i dont know where u are from but they have classes in england! I went there with my puppy and he's as good as gold now :)|`|BDRIeLqUaa	I'd try puppy class, and crate training|`|vaEkSkNnaa	You took pup away from mum too early .

6ae0aSbvaa	In a nutshell, Schutzhund is sleeve work, French Ring focuses on leg bites, and PSA is primarily suit work.  The other two had good advice also.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Schutzhund is much more common in the states than the other two.  Go check out some clubs and see which ones fit you and your dog the best.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	It all depends on who you talk to and who you have training around you. You may have a great RIng club with a great training director...but maybe you prefer Schutzhund. You need to visit clubs around you, and make up your own mind. I can tell you this...there are a lot of good Schutzhund clubs in the U.S. It's pretty difficult to find good Ring/PSA trainers in most areas.

My pup would try to be a rampunctous little pup and I had to keep her as calm and get her to rest as much as possible. She would just stop walking and look concerned. I know from personal experience that stitches aren't the most comfortable thing ever. Mine felt like they were going to pop open for the first week or so.     If he doesn't seem to be in pain (more so than to be expected from a surgery) and his area doesn't look infected there shouldn't be anything to worry about. Make sure he doesn't try to rip them out. If you're still concerned you can always call your vet and ask. :)
YK8zJNluaa	Check with your states "parks and wildlife" service.  You will pay around $60 for 2 years. You should look at a python.  You can also keep mildly venomous snakes on a class 1 in NSW. VIC may be the same.  The link bellow will be your best chance of getting all the info on first time snakes.  By the way snakes are Venomous not poisonous.  Be sure to do a lot of research before you buy your snake.  The site bellow will be a great help to you.    EDIT:  You will need a lic for ALL Australian reptiles.  NO EXCEPTION.  NON Australian snakes like these snakes,  ball python king/milk snake, are illegal in Australia. And you will face heavy fines and or prison if caught and your illegal reptiles WILL be destroyed. Its not worth it..  Check on the parks and wildlife site for your state and you will find a list of reptiles and classes of licence for them.|`|b97IpZBOaa	good question|`|Yn5ADAd1aa	i do not think you need a lic for a snake in victoria. the way you can find out is go to or look up on the internet for you local laws. the only city that has a law like that, that i know about is San Francisco.|`|c8il2SNnaa	you need a licence for most aussie animals. Try ringing your department for environment and heritage (try the yellow pages) for a basic keep and sell permit. On this you will only be able to keep non Venomous animals.

e6wo7czgaa	Your dad is correct. Birds can carry disease but that doesn't mean every bird has one.  You should do more research before you buy a bird for yourself and your brother. Its very uncommon to have parrots pass on disease especially if they were brought up by a breeder or is in a pet store. But that doesn't mean they're all safe. You still have to look for any symptoms for sickness. This doesn't mean they are diseased as they are just sick. And birds are known to hide their sickness from natural instincts. If your father is worried explain to him that yes some birds do carry disease's however not every type of bird does, like the pigeon which is known for carrying disease's.   Even though you think you got a healthy bird you must still see a vet about it to confirm it. You must also have cleanser for the cage, as well as mite cleanser. Mites are like head-lice to us, but for the bird these mite's can live in the smallest of crooks in the birds cage. That is one reason you must clean your cage, the other reason is the poop.   Everybody knows that poop shouldn't be in the house, that's there's toilets. Birds don't have toilets therefore there cage is like a outhouse inside there cage. And you have to clean weekly. Of course you can put newspaper for the catching and throw it out. But you still have to clean it. This prevents diseases from happening as well as sickness for your bird.  If your unsure of what kind of bird you want ask yourself what type of personality and lifestyle do I have?  Are you a first time bird owner? If so get the less complicated birds like prehaphs a budgie. Something cheap but still affectionate.  If your in a close range of your neighbours and they hate loud noises- get a bird that will make less noise, like a parrotlet.  Are you someone who will interact with the bird? If not alot or no you might want a bird that you can look at and enjoy the company but not the playing I would suggest finche or canary.  Just a tip, if you don't like cleaning get a smaller bird. smaller bird = smaller mess.  Really in the end its your choice of bird you want, and you have to talk to your father because not all birds can live outside.  hope this helped|`|TBPzDU2vaa	Your Dad is correct.

TDQ7zopVaa	Staffie staffie staffie!!! loyal, people devoted dogs, settled and cuddly in the house, energetic when you go out. However they MUST be socialised with other dogs at an early age to prevent dog-aggression. Staffies may want to "fight" your small animals, so although normally I would suggest a rescue dog, I suggest you get a puppy so you can train it from a young age to treat your small animals with respect. Staffies are so eager to please their owners that they will do anything, so I'm sure leaving your small fluffies alone wont be too much bother.    You should be paying around 600 for a quality staffie puppy, buy from a reputable breeder not some junkie backyarder who is looking to make money out of hard looking dogs (you can tell, they'll charge half the price of a good breeder). You should try your local rescue centres first though, people dump staffies of all ages, approx 40% of dogs in rescues are staffy or cross staffie so you might not have trouble finding a dog young enough to train!|`|LyoKmnZZaa	australian shepherd|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	How about a shelti (like a mini lassie)?  I'm a cross breed girl myself, but have always found the bigger breeds more fun - this is ok, because i live right on the hills, but I am dogless right now, and will be forevermore, because I can't get over losing my last dog (lab collie cross, heart attack at only 5 years old).    How about a Samoyed?  Or an Airdale Terrier often called the King of Terriers because it is a standard dog size.  Both will require a lot of exercise, but if you give them it, they only need a home to sleep in afterwards.      Schnauzers come in Miniature and large, but perhaps the large is too large for a flat?  They are not big barkers, so that much is a good thing.    Stear clear of hounds in general - or St Bernard or Newfoundlands (not just for the size but they were often trained to bark) The same can be said for any dog typically used as guard animals.

Just to let you know that most male beagles have a tendency to pee in the house (they mark there territory). They will do there howling bark if someone is walking by the house or another animal is around the house. Even though they are hunting dogs, mine was fine with the guinea pig. I just kept him in another room when I let the Guinea pig in his play yard. If you don't they will try to catch them. But he never bothered him in the cage at all. Not sure about birds.

They are unusual, so not as overbred as other breeds and tend to be very healthy, however they get overheated a lot so may involve lots of work to keep them cool.    Hungarian Vizsla's are another option. They are possibly slightly larger than the size you wanted, but we used to keep them. They are high energy, but settle beautifully in the home, they are known as "velcro dogs" because they are so devoted to their owners. The coat is short and doesnt require much upkeep, and they are very handsome, a little like red weimaraners.    You could try and find a "pet" or show strain of beagle. They have a bad reputation but this is normally cos the hunting dogs are just unbeareable in a small house. The pet beagles are actually easy to train and not too loud.    Dont know much about duck tollers, but to be honest I hear they are loud and energetic all day, every day!    Some crosses you could look for are staffie-collie (athletic but less neurotic than a collie, tend to be devoted to their owners so calm in the household), lab-collie, retriever collie, or cocker spaniel-collie (springer spaniel-collie would probably be too crazy for what you are after).    Bear in mind with any cross breed there is no guarantee of what mixture you're going to get, shelters are a good option if you want a cross, because the staff will know the dogs well.
Chxoncy7aa	Welcome to the wonderful world of min pins!  I have 9 currently.  His coat problems are common for min pins.  They often have no hair underneath, sometimes their chest, and in front of their ears.  Weak back end?  Could he have leg perthes?  It's common in min pins.  House training, well, min pins are never fully house trained.  You may think they are, but most iwll have accidents for a   of reasons.  Yours now does not like the cold, since he survived a few nights in it.  You are lucky he survived, a lot do not.  They can be very messy in crates, not caring if they lay in it.  I can say out of my 9, I think I have 1 that is completely house trained.  He will go outside in anything, and does not have mistakes.  However, if I say fall asleep on the couch, and he really has to go.  He will make an honest attempt to wake me, but after a while he would just go.  Min pins are a tough breed, and are nothing like large dogs.  The only thing I can say to try, is attach a leash to you so he can not sneak off and have an accident.  If he does it while you are not home, there is not a whole lot you can do.  And yes, they love to rip up training pads, and dog litter.....forget it.  They play with it and make a mess.|`|vPde97E2aa	Nope,the breed has EXTREMELY fine/thin coats.    & the lack of housebreaking is your fault.It's untrained,ill-mannered & spoiled rotten.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	OK- so part of the issue is that you are using pee pad and many dogs don't understand the difference between going on the floor and going on the mat.  Go back to potty training 101.  Make sure they are on a feeding schedule.  Don't allow them to free feed.  Whatever they don't eat in 15 minutes gets picked up and fairly soon they will learn to eat it all at once.  About 30-45 minutes after they eat, take them on a nice long walk on a leash.  If they don't go, crate them for about 20-30 minutes (with you watching them, of course, if he is prone to messing his crate) and leash them up and take them back outside again.  Repeat until they go and praise like crazy when they get it right.  Since you are gone during the day, start this on your days off. It will take longer, but it will work. Keep the dog with you at all times in the house when you are home, or crated.  That way you can watch him for signs that he has to go.  We had a manchester that was impossible to house break and the breeder told us to do it this way and it worked.  Good luck!  Also, you are doing the right thing by not crating him while you work, knowing he will mess the crate.  That is a hard habit to break them of and it doesn't help him to get his own mess all over himself.  The poor guy!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Get the dog on a set schedule. What goes in will come out soon after the dog is fed, and he is still a puppy so it doesn't take long.  Feed the dog at least an hour or more before he will need to be in the crate, wait about 20 to 30 minutes after he eats to let him out. Once the dog gets used to going outside he will learn to hold it until he goes out.  I doubt the back end problem has anything to do with it, since he can pee OK    Oh I just noticed the pee pads, those encourge the dog to go in the house|`|1bRRODd2aa	Ah, poor you.  Pity the house training didn't work.  Min Pins can be very stubborn, and your situation is a good example of just how stubborn they can be.    It is possible to re-train, but it basically means being more stubborn than he is and do NOT allow him back inside until he poops, then praise him effusively. Repeat until he catches on. Put him out after eating and he should poop within an hour.  If the weather is very cold (ice/snow) then consider creating an ice/snow free area for him to use to poop.     As for his crate.  Get him a bigger crate that you can divide into two halves, a bed area and a newspaper area.  That should give him room to avoid having to lie in his poop.    As for the baby coming.  You are going to have to segregate an area of your house where the dogs can live and mess, and completely out of bounds to your baby/toddler.  This should avoid any health issues that you may be concerned with.    Don't worry, you've only got another 10 years or so of this!|`|NBKoC6hEaa	THe reason I clicked on this question because I have the same problem except I had my pup for 3 months he's a toy pom and he's a pain in the behind to potty train.... like you said I had wee wee pads in the bathroom but he treats the whole bathroom as a litter box and shreds his wee wee pads... so I decided I will only do the outside potty thing.. it works only if i physically take him but he wont let me know and go where ever he please... however, when he goes outside he runs to the treat box and when he goes inside he runs  and hide... I know min pups are extremely hard to train and they get confused easily and with all the trama yours had to go through maybe you shuold start all over from scratch using different approach when he go outside to pee put him on a leash and keep telling him to go poo (if his not used to the leash he wont like it) keep trying he'll get used it... good luck...|`|OxFsslN8aa	What is the outside temperature where you live?  You said you put a sweater on him but do you also put boots on him?  Where I live the temps get below zero and my mini dachshund needs to wear boots because the time it takes her to find the "perfect pooping place" can be a long time.  My guess is that when she ran away & was hurt her circulation could have been affected & perhaps her feet are sensitive to cold.  Try boots and stand out with her.  Keep in mind that dogs usually need to poop anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes after they have eaten.  Perhaps you are putting her out too soon after eating?  On a day when you can monitor her eating & pooping try to figure out how long she lasts before she needs to "go".  Good luck.|`|0q2B11ygaa	wowo lots there sweetie but i juss need the points thnx|`|zWFJBlJZaa	You say he has a weak back end.  This in itself may be part of the poop problem and you should talk to your Vet about it; however, you also say that his house-training  deteriorated after he ran away from home which makes sense as he then could go anywhere his little heart desired.  So now you are back to square one.  He is 2 yrs. old so he can easily hold it for 8 full hours, if healthy.  You need to start as if he has never had any housebreaking training.  You need to highly praise ANY TIME he goes on the potty pad.  Do not acknowledge his mistakes and do not clean up in front of him.  Use white vinegar to clean the in house areas to eliminate any lingering odor.    Also see:    http://dogstardaily.com-train-aft|`|BXLm8OVoaa	Don't listen to the people who say it's your fault he's not trained First thing to do, is be calm. You have to keep trying to train him, going right back to basics with picking him up and putting him on the newspaper when he does start, and moving the paper nearer the door once he learns, you can teach older dog's new tricks lol.  If the vet didn't find anything wrong then i shouldn't worry it could be he'd had a heart attack, and in which case just take it easy with him, make sure other dogs don't jump on him or wind him up. I think that type of dog is just naturally small with very little hair.  All i can suggest with the baby is to generally keep them away from each other, because there is evidence which suggests that children under 3yrs which are exposed directly to dogs constantly (like being covered in their hair and saliva) are less healthy than those who aren't.  good luck.|`|AA12128656	well, i'm sorry but i do agree with blunt, although i'm going to put it a little differently...    this dog needs to be watched every second you are home. he should be taken out to potty often, and after every meal. you must walk him until he goes.     with problem dogs, i've trained them to understand that they won't go back in the house till they go potty. once they get that, they usually go as quickly as possible so they can get back in where it's warm.    when you catch him in the act, you need to correct him, not just clean it up and let it go. and since you're not going to let him roam the house, you should be able to catch every accident, right?    you basically need to retrain this guy as if he were a brand new pup.  and a shake can may help you to startle him enough not to potty when you catch him about to do it.      p.s. yes, get rid of the pee pads. they are confusing. dogs need to potty outside.  do NOT get him a crate large enough to potty on one side and sleep on the other. you need to train him to hold it, not allow him to potty inside any more.
EdN7fkTgaa	The following lists some sign of a pregnant hamster:  - weight gain a few days after mating  - more aggressive/cranky  - the hamster starts building a nest  - your hamster eats more and hoards more food  - Swelling of the belly button  If she is pregnant here is some help:   Usually, in my experience, I am always ensure.    When you figure out she's pregnant, start feeding her food high in protein, like cheese, peanut butter, and oats. Don't overfeed, though.     I've read it's best to keep the father in the cage with the mother. My advice: take him out as soon as she starts looking fat. He will probably eat the babies, not care for them. Some fathers do help raise the babies and take care of mom, but to be on the safe side, take him out. Also, the moment after the mother gives birth, she goes into heat.  The male WILL mate with her and she will become pregnant again and deliver in 18 days.  That is another reason why I recommend separating him.  This gives her time to rest between litters.       As soon as your mom hamster starts to look fat, you can expect babies in approximately 2-7 days, depending on how your hamster handles her pregnancy.  One of my females gets fat and 2 days later has babies; the other gets fat and has hers a week later.  It just depends on the hamster.     When she starts to deliver, mom will hunch over and start moving around a lot. Usually, she will have all of the babies in her nest, but she might also have them in different areas in the cage. Don't worry, though, she will gather them up and bring them back. If you get a good look, you might see her deliver one. They come out head first and feet first. It doesn't matter, so don't worry about it. Mom will take care of herself and her new litter.     My best advice to you when your hamster has babies is to leave her completely alone and keep the cage in a quiet room. Only get in her cage to give her extra food and water. Don't touch the babies for two weeks, or she might eat them.  Clean the cage out a couple of days before she is due to give birth. Remember, you won't be able to clean it for two weeks. Baby hamsters are extremely cute, but be sure you have homes lined up for them.|`|xCLX9Aczaa	I had 21 of them because they multiplied fast.  Dwarf hamsters are one of the most aggressive out of all the hamsters.  I remember we had to seperate them in different tanks to keep them from fighting.  And if it is pregnant, you'll find out in a month.
d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	this is hard to say as temperature is of hugh importance.At 78-80degrees they will hatch in 48-60 hrs.any higher temp can damage the eggs or resulting fry|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Usually take around 48hours That is if the male has fertilized them. Watch them closely over the next couple of hours.  Good luck|`|ur5wDhkMaa	The root mean is day 4, but they hatch over a period of hours, mother nature seldom does things by the clock :o)    You should be able to see the fry inside the eggs if you can get a close enough view as they are rather small.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	usually 2 days|`|Qhdozm54aa	If they don't hatch within the next day or so it is very likely that the eggs are unfertilized as the eggs normally hatch within a couple of days. Also always remove the eggs after they have been layed as the parents are well known for consuming their own young.
XPB6Ogj0aa	I did and wore it out.  It just died and now I have to get a new one.  They can be pricey so I am saving up for one.  I only have one complaint, that is the noise.  In my one bedroom condo I can hear it when the motor runs.  It only takes a short while for you to get used to the noise and ignore it.  They are wonderful.    I had a LitterMaid and the waste receptacles can be expensive so we cheated a little and lined the waste receptacle with those throw away plastic grocery store bags.  Yippee the waste receptacle last a long time; therefore, I don't spend as much.    There is another expense that I would highly recommend.  Litter Maid has a privacy tent that I loved.  I have to get another one, I tripped and fell on it and broke it.)  It is big, white and washable vinyl.  ALL litter boxes fit in it (electronic and non-electronic).  Keeps the splashed out litter contained and presents a white box, not a litter box, for people to see.|`|0ef3O2m6aa	Yes, I bought one 6months or so ago.  I love it.  Less litter is wasted and my cat always has a clean box.  I will forwarn you tho that the plastic litter recepticals get expensive.  I reuse them...basically dump and put back in.  My cat is afraid of vacuums etc that make noise.  I was a bit worried she would be afraid of the litter  box so I locked her in the bathroom for 2 days to be sure she was using it, all went well!|`|b0c29a6de1e2f315bec2fc65873f467baa	I have used the Littermaid in the past and hated it. It would start up way too soon and it stopped working after a little while. I've been using a newer product, Scoopfree http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js... , for about two years and it is awesome. I would recommend getting a permanent tray from here http://www.foreverlittertrays.com/
AA10029366	Dogs typically live longer than wolves.    Wolves run into deadly situations every day -- being injured by a prey animal or while defending territory, starvation, running into traps and poisons, being shot from the air by Sarah Palin -- living as a wild predator is a very dangerous business.    Dogs are (normally) guaranteed a meal, shelter, health care, and safety.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	domestic dogs have an average longer life span because of vaccines, good nutrition and not having to fight for survival.|`|oba1NFNdaa	dogs will live longer than wolves, they will live longer because dogs are fed the right way and wolves dont always get the right diet.|`|BXLm8OVoaa	Domestic dogs live longer than wild wolves because they have a comfier lifestyle, in the wild any animal that stops working even slightly tends to die, but put in the same situations a wolf would live for longer than your average dog. Of course, it also depends on what breed dog it is, obviously a bulldog cannot compare to a Alsatian.  But i would generally say wolf (in a fair test) because they still undergo natural selection, in the wild wolves are bread to survive, where as a dog (mostly) is bread by humans to look a certain way, which quite often is detrimental to it's health.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	I would say dogs will.  Just because our pet dogs have access to vets, so they can be treated for illness and injury.  Wolves don't have that luxury.  Also, wolves are exposed to the climate more than well-cared for pets.  Wolves live in a harsh world of "survival of the fittest".  We've removed our dogs from that.

q1b7170caa	I would leave it overnight and take him to the vets tomorrow if hes not any better - I expect you are right and he strained it jumping off the couch or playing.  If it was anything to worry about then he would yelp when you touched his leg.  Just check that there is nothing stuck in his pads by pushing you finger up between them on the bottom of his foot - it may be a splinter that you haven't noticed.  He will soon shout if there is anything.|`|1bRRODd2aa	If it doesn't improve by tomorrow then a vet visit would be in order. He's probably just strained something.     Try to keep your pups from launching themselves off anything higher than about a foot off the ground.  Their bones and joints are very fragile and cannot withstand the impact of landing from a jump.  Wait until they are a year old before allowing them to jump down from higher than their own shoulder height.  They can easily get fractures in the growth plates in their joints and this can be a permanent debilitating injury.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	he could have staved it and that's why he is limping also he could have pulled a muscle in the back leg as well|`|duemKP0Aaa	your sister might have grab his is back right leg|`|3wJGXfkKaa	I would check and make sure their isn't anything in his foot first.  See if you can't get him to rest for a while then let him walk again later and see if he still has a limp in that leg, then if he does you know to go ahead and take him to the vet when you get your car back or until someone can take you.  He could've landed on it wrong or could've played a little to rough or something.  If he's not showing you any pain dogs are good at hiding pain really good so rub it gently but she what kind of reaction he gives you.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Why don't you have a VET look at him.    add: we can't tell you what is wrong. it could be anything from a sprain to a joint problem to a nerve problem. The vet is the only one that can diagnosis and treat the problem|`|C1eHfhrHaa	he may have just landed wrong.  If it doesn't seem to rectify itsself by tomorrow, take him to the vet.  It doesn't sound like there is major damage since he doesn't seem to be in pain.
bH1DYr5saa	I was watching 'The Dog Whisperer' last night, and there was a dog on there that was growling at his owners all the time.  Ceaser Milan told them not to worry about the growling as it doesn't necessarily mean the dog is going to be aggressive - the dog was just very tense a lot of the time (like yours sounds) and was just vocalising that nervousness. So I guess the baby crying makes the dog tense and he is just saying to you that he doesn't like it! I guess that is backed up by the fact that he then leaves the room!  I think the main thing to do is make sure your dog is calm around the baby, or any situation he is scared in. This mainly involves you as his leader remaining calm and in-control at all times. As Ceaser Milan would say, the reason your mum's dogs beat yours up is because your dog is too timid and not projecting the right energy, with is calm-submissive, and the other dogs are actually trying to put him in his place because your dogs' energy is affecting them. - sounds a bit confusing I know, but if you've never watched 'The Dog Whisperer' I would highly recommend it - the guy is amazing !|`|6bXii13paa	There are many issues that a "growl" can lend to.    I personally would have had to have seen the interaction and also know your dog and her body language as well, in order to give a possible reason for her behavior.  Regarding your description of being timid and shy, she may be extremely reactive and fearful.  Be aware that fear is an extremely volatile emotion in even humans.  It can and often does elicit aggressive responses.  I have a bit of concern that she has shown this same behavior with you in other situations.    Honestly it seems from the method that you explained the situation, that your dog may be in need of some behavioral modification.  Not because I think she is an immediate threat to your baby or you but because she does not seem to be very mentally/emotionally sound.  The two breeds she represents are active dogs by nature but I feel,and keep in mind that I am only going by what I read from you and how I interpreted it, that she has some anxiety issues and is really not functioning well.   Maybe you  could do some research and find a behaviorist in your area to consult with you on the issue.  I do wish you the best and congratulations on your new baby.  I would like to add that allowing your already overly anxious dog to get "beat up on" by other dogs is certainly not helping her fearfullness any at all.  And to the people that obviously watch Cesar Millan, Dogs do not see humans as other dogs, therefore the baby is not one of the "pack".  It is methods used by cesar that cause the type of behavior issues that this question relates to.  You are not a dog, so your dog will not see you as an Alpha dog.|`|iOmi2JAtaa	how do you feel when baby cries? now im not accusing its only we had similar problem. our dogs got upset because i was stressed at times and she was feeding off my stress?|`|XKNQkwuGaa	i think she is just showing that she doesn't want to be disturbed and the growl is a way of telling u she is not happy to be moved or uncomfortable.  my husky who is big will do this when something upsets him and he also head bunts u. it is a way of communicating so when she does just tell her no and pet her so she will relax.my big guy will then moan and groan and be content after i talk to him and give him a good rub. she includes the baby as part of the family and knows his scent but as he gets bigger and starts toddling around keep a close eye.my husky has never bitten anyone and lets the kids or other dogs and pups jump all over him but again he will growl just to back them up. good luck|`|3HSNFDaJaa	We have a 3 year old very timid Boxer male and I am expecting a baby in May. I'm slightly nervous as to how he will cope, he's never been around babies, only older kids (we have a 9 and 13 year old). I trust him hand on heart with kids. He loves them and they can do anything to him. Our dog has never growled, only barks when a knock on the door etc but is scared of everything, traffic, the dark, smoke alarm, motorbikes, the list is endless. My husband wanted me to rehome the dog but I told him if anyone was being rehomed it would be him!!!  The dog has never given me any reason to be wary and I think if yours were going to harm the baby it would've happened by now. We had some one to one training sessions which also included the lady coming to our house and watching the dog in certain situations so she coud "read" him. Have you considered this? She just basically told us that our dog had not been socialised (he was kenneled upto 12 hrs a day) and had not experienced the noises and sights of day to day life and that by the time we got him (he was 8/9 months) that the damage had been done. Its sad because we can't take him to the seaside in the summer because he's so scared of the crowds and stuff. Would you believe that it took him 3 months of living with us before he dare climb the stairs in the house, when he did it took my husband nearly an hour to get him down one by one. He was terrified. Although I class my dog as a rescue dog I did actually buy him from a breeder for 150, she charges 600 for a pup. Its disgusting. I would suggest professional advice, ideally with someone coming to your home so the dog is comfortable. One thing she did suggest was to get a crate so that if the dog feels threatened or nervous he has a special place to go himself where he will learn that if he's in there he will be left alone. You seem to be getting alot of grief on here, I would not get rid of the dog without seeking help and advice from a proffessional. I think alot of dogs in rehoming centres etc are there because of babies etc, some rightly so, as long as you do what you're doing not leaving them alone together etc you should persevere unless of course the dog does show other signs of threatening behaviour. Good luck.|`|x86mC8yyaa	My dog is generally lovely with children, although he doesn't see them very much, except when we stay with our grandchildren. However, there have been two occasions when he has growled fircely and snapped at two of the children. Both have been occasions when a child has been accidentally left alone with him and has approached him in a way which he has evidently considered challenging. One incident was when our 5-year-old grandson was playing pirates, swinging a sword around and shouting, then went to 'play'with the dog, and the other was when our 4-year-old granddaughter was going up to him on his chair, approaching him at eye level and putting her arms round his neck to 'love' him. Neither child was injured, though badly frightened, but all the parents concerned were very upset and the incidents were not good for family relationships. I could see it from the dog's point of view - his space was being invaded, the children obviously weren't used to watching out for the signals he was giving that he was becoming uncomfortable or frightened, there was no human backup there to defend him, and in the end he just snapped, in both senses of the word. I was told off by the parents in both incidents for not hitting or punishing the dog, which I would have done if I had been there the moment it happened, but obviously our first care was for the child in each case, and by the time I focused on the dog I thought it was too late to punish him as he wouldn't connect this with what had happened. Also, I felt it was my fault, not his, for leaving him in that situation, which wouldn't have arisen if I had been there to guide the children.     I do think that dogs, especially terriers, need to be watched all the time when growing up with babies in particular, as the sort of noises a baby or small child makes can easily send the dog into prey drive, because the high, squeaky voices and cries sound like the small animals they have been bred to hunt. Also, children wave their arms and grab at dogs in ways the dog finds threatening, and I don't think they can be blamed for being pushed beyond their limits. Children need careful training with dogs. Blame isn't appropriate, either for the dog or the child, but as adults we need to train both of them to live with each other, and be constantly alert with the little ones.|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	I think it was her way of telling the baby to be quiet. If you don't feel that she is a threat to the baby then I would not worry about. It is the same as you get agitated and stomp out of the room. My dog will run her mouth in protest if she doesn't like something. For her leaving the room when the baby cries it is probably because it hurts her ears. To dogs the pitch is alot louder|`|0lcSi5tnaa	Just know this Jack Russell Terriers are some of the best small game dogs there is so do not sleep on the dog and think it wont bite, be careful around those little demons!|`|8rF3wAHtaa	Timid dogs often mean nervous dogs which means they could lash out unexpectedly.  You say that you know she will nevver bite, but to be honest that's what they all say until it happens one day and half their childs face is hanging off. Sorry, but that's the reality.  For your babies sake, you need to keep the dog away from him|`|luwTb77Waa	Jack russells are generally mean..  but the dog could just be having a bad day...or the sound of the sudden cry could have frightened her?|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	you are being very irresponsible for letting this dog near your baby.    any dog should be watched when near babies or children even if the dog is 100%.    your dog isnt 100% and just because it didnt open its mouth to bite this time it doesnt mean it wont next time.    even if you are watching the dog and baby the dog can bite so quickly you wont be able to stop it.    have you told your dog off for growling? or just let him growl and think its ok.    in my opinion your dog will get worse and start getting more aggressive unless you try and teach him that growling isnt  acceptable.    dogs are pack animals and they need to know they are bottom of the family. you need to teach him that you and your baby are above him and he is bottom or he will think hes boss.    you should keep the dog away from your baby. its dangerous having the dog licking your babies face as he could bite before you have time to stop  him.    if you dont take any precautions you wont be doing anyone a favour.    if your dog does bite the baby the dog will get put down, your baby will need to go to hospital and might have a scar forever and you may get visited from social services for letting it happen to your baby.    im not saying get rid of the dog or anything but dont let it be licking the babies face or never leave it alone with your baby even for a second.|`|s9haCi64aa	Just because she is timid wont mean she wont bite, timid dogs will act out to defend themselves if they feel threatened. TBH I wouldnt have her on the sofa after that, she probably thinks she is above the baby is the pecking order. Growling at you because you have woken her is also unacceptable.    Try a few sugestions on this website so she knows you and your family are the leader and not her.    http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	Are you maybe mistaking it as a growl?  My dog makes a sound that sounds more like a groan - like he is fed up & moaning about it.  Just because your dog is timid, I wouldn't take that as to presume she can't be the opposite.  She may get beaten up by your mums yorkshire terriers but that is because she is the submissive one amongst that pack.  Your 10 week old baby isn't able to dominate himself over your dog to let your dog know it's place in the pack order.  This means that your dog probably sees itself as the dominant one between itself & your baby & could result in her displaying dominant behaviour towards your baby.  I would be careful to keep them seperate or keep a very close eye on them.  A very timid dog is an emotionally unbalanced dog, & an emotionally unbalanced dog can be unpredictable.  At the end of the day, a dog is an animal who adheres to pack order & works on instinct.|`|CiGVGhDZaa	my dog has done this on occasion as well and i think that it is just their way of groaning.  you know your dog better than anyone else.  if she wouldn't hurt a fly, she may just be annoyed.  some dogs get more vocal with age as well.|`|CEoCe9ENaa	I am very concerned about this behaviour.  It sounds as if your dog does not accept the baby as a pack member yet.  Even very timid dogs can turn, so please please be careful.  I would seriously consider rehoming the dog, but that has to be your decision of course.
vS1Z0inOaa	Basically you don't. Don't move the turtles out until it's been warm for awhile--early summer or late spring--and make sure they have a good basking area in the sun. The sun will warm it naturally. In winter you can use a stock heater to keep the water liquid so it doesn't freeze and let the turtles hibernate in there. It's OK if the water drops to freezing teperatures in the winter as long as it stays liquid. You do need to make sure your turtles can withstand your climate and first introduce them when it's warm and everybody is awake, but other than that nature will kick in and care for your turtles much better than you ever could in an indoors tank. I've seen it happen over and over--there's nothing like an outdoors setup for any turtle ;) and it greatly reduces your own workload too...|`|EX1GjjJCaa	You don't.

She will lose them all and they wont be like little needles any more.|`|EFA4Azb1aa	Yes they do but when he is a year get them checked.  My present dog was seven when I got him and underweight.  The reason was that he still had puppy teeth in amongst his adult teeth and could not eat properly.|`|im3vWyv6aa	Yes, they sure do. Our puppy seemed like she was losing all her teeth at the same time.    I have a cute story that goes along with this. When it looks like our puppy is chewing on something she shouldn't, we have trained her to "drop it" when we tell her to. One day she looked like she was chewing away on something... my husband went up to her and said, "drop it". She was looking at him with these eyes (you have got to see these eyes) and she was opening her mouth and twisting her jaw all around trying to drop it. When it wouldn't fall out my husband put his finger in her mouth to see if he could fish it out... turned out it was a tooth just hanging, but still slightly attached. We still chuckle about that... her expressions are priceless.|`|ykH93Wyxaa	yes|`|MUG9gTA0aa	yes they do
po62AbPqaa	hi, rats are highly intelligent. They are like tiny dogs in terms of the amount of commands they can learn and their willingness to please their owner once they have bonded.    they are very much wrongly maligned...pet rats are a domesticated version and scientists have found a gene on the neural crest that has altered...the main differences we see is that pet rat skin pigment is pink...they have little pink hands/paws and they are not aggressive.     In fact a pet rat will not bite viciously as a rule, not like a wild rat which even if hand raised will still bite when mature, pet rats might bite if frightened or accidentally , like if their owner has the bad habit of feeding through the bars of the cage...ratties have very poor eyesight and might mistake fingers then for food...so feeding through the bars of he cage is a no no!!!    rats are very affectionate once a person has earned their trust...they are cautious...after all they are at the bottom of the food chain, but they are very very smart and can learn their name, be toilet trained and learn and perform many tricks    rats need a very large cage and at least an hour a day out of their cage for free ranging/exploring and playtime with their owner. One should NOT get a ratty if they cant put the time into one...they fret and get sad and lonely and that's just not nice    rats are great to feed...they have cute little meals...so sweet!!! They are omnivores so they eat a variety and they eat pretty much what we humans do so no need to get special foods, although there are rat lab blocks available that are a balanced diet with all the required nutrients for optimum health, but stil they need some variety and fresh foods    I love making my ratties dinner...it is soooo cute...they have tiny dishes and they eat so daintily...holding the food in their little hands....they also Must have a bowl of fresh water as well as a dispenser of drinking water becasue they like to WASH their FACE and Hands after eating...too too cute :>    pet rats do not carry diseases that are communicable to humans. Pet rats are even more fastidiously cleaner than cats and constantly groom themselves and their cage friend.    rats must live with at least one other rat...research has shown that they are highly social and will have increased health problems and die younger if housed as a single ratty...litter mates are great and loving friends for life    Rats are hysterical...each one has a great unique personality and they get up to the cutest antics...more fun that watching tv    ratties are cute, funny, intelligent, and downright adorable!!!     Im giving you links to my favourite ratty vids and subscribers...show them to your boyf  good luck :>|`|CVrLmjebaa	Rats are not always sick. My hamster never got sick. I just always take it a bath monthly. Don't show him dirty rats|`|GenpGk7Daa	Rats are intelligent, sweet, unique and smell nice. My rats are gorgeous animals with very inquisitive personalities.

They can be poorly bred & genetically unstable, but not evil. That is a human not a canine trait.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	None of the above only humans are capable of evil.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	None, because dogs can not be evil.    There can be poorly trained dogs and irresponsible owners though.|`|VV5KZjGRaa	My shitzu is a little evil puppy but she's gorgeous!|`|R534McNOaa	"D" plus you missed out "Spit" the "Jack Russel" the one my son-in-law has!|`|3uIOlUo7aa	Ignorance based question.  There is no 'evil breed of dog' -- none of those breeds inherently are 'evil' at all.   I have known excellent, properly tempered representatives of all those breeds and only someone who knows nothing whatsoever about dogs in general would make such a silly question up in the first place.|`|42SipZEPaa	chihuahua|`|AA11119758	Actually, it's the Belongstoanasshole hound-you know, the one with the owner who mistreats the dog so he can have a mean dog to bolster his weak self image?|`|xhkkUsSBaa	my dog! lol he's my little monster but i love him!|`|hoeN5xP0aa	None of the above; no dog is "evil"; It is evil people owning good dogs that make things go wrong. I compare a dog to a child in this manner: You have a child who you repeatedly do drugs, drink, and beat people up in front of, or beat, It's likely the child would be full of anger and things as well. Same goes for a dog, you beat it, and yell at it all the time, and aren't responsible, of course the dog may have anger issues... if I got up and did these things to you every day of your life, wouldn't you be a little vicious towards people as well??|`|AA12083992	What ever breed that is being trained (or not trained) by irresponsible jerks.

And yes I have owned two of those  "evil" breeds and I am more afraid of my evil cockateil who will happily draw blood/ attack.    (just to add I don't actually think my bird is evil he is just territorial of his cage, out of it he is fine)|`|TSsT8QGgaa	E) none of the above.  dogs are not BORN MEAN (EVIL)...it is the owner that can cause a problem.  i have an A and B above and neither are mean/evil.  the poor breed gets a bad rap because some people abuse them and then the WHOLE world is against it.  honestly i think little dogs are the most evil,, in MY experience they are jumpy, hyper, quick to bite/snap, evil little things, that bark constantly.|`|fHG29qT4aa	None of the above I have had all 3 dogs, currently a rottweiler and 2 Golden's and they are all project pup dogs that go into nursing homes and schools and hospitals.

Nah... Maybe dogs that were treated the wrong way wanted to let go of its feelings so that is could attack. But I'm no good at do at dogs so      E. I have no idea           or  D. All of the above !!!|`|94f6ff7f9e1c2a0c22c21ba9d02d80daaa	That's an ignorant question. Humans are evil and cruel. Dogs only act on what they've been taught.|`|QuAFPRQCaa	The most evil breed of dog is the human male!  For all those women out there--need I say more?
u3Hdoeiqaa	Yes.    For a start they are completely unnecessary. All the scientific evidence (and there is plenty of it) suggests that training methods based on positive reinforcement are the most effective.     There is absolutely no need to use physical punishment to train a dog. A great many people successfully train dogs using positive reinforcement - without the use of any training collars or physical punishment. Not just standard "pet" training either - but various competition dogs, service dogs etc. In the UK none of the service dog groups (guide dogs, hearing dogs, dogs for the disabled etc) use choke chains.    Secondly, choke chains have a high potential to cause injury - from mild hair loss and reddening of the skin, through bruising, and up to major problems like muscular damage, collapsed tracheas, transient leg ataxia, damage to occular blood vessels, etc. One study of police dogs trained with choke chains found that about 48 out of 50 dogs had permanent neck injury. When Woodhouse was still popular many dogs suffered from a condition known at the time as "Woodhouse neck".    Thirdly, choke chains cause suffering. Partly in the immediate sense (they are painful) but they can also have long term adverse effects. For example, if a correction is given when the dog is focused on something, the dog may learn to associate that "something" with pain. This is frequently seen in cases of on-leash aggression to other dogs. The dog pulls towards another dog, and is corrected. The result, the dog becomes dog aggerssive - because it associates other dogs with the correction. Many behaviourists have to deal with fall-out like this on a regular basis.    Of course people will always argue that choke chains are fine when used correctly. Let's analyse that:    Firstly, choke chains are freely available everywhere with no instruction on how to use them "correctly". As a result, most people have no idea which way round it should go, how to check and release, how hard to check, not to use on puppies or delicate necked breeds etc. I can honestly say that in all the dogs I have seen on choke chains, I have NEVER seen one being used correctly.    Secondly, this problem is aggravated by popular TV trainers (cough - Milan - cough) using them incorrectly. Such trainers go on TV and hang dogs to the point of asphyxiation, let them pull, etc. Use chokes on breeds like long necked sighthounds and bulldogs (very dangerous).     Thirdly - there is no evidence to suggest that choke chains are fine when used "correctly". We know choke chains cause pain, and sometimes injury and behavioural problems. There is no proof that using them properly negates these risks.    So here is the million dollar question....  WHY do people still use them? They are painful, easy to misuse / abuse, very high risk, totally unnecessary, and not particularly effective.  There are better methods available - methods which are more humane, safer and more effective. Why anyone would risk their dog's health and well being is beyond me.|`|opjYENGGaa	Yes, with a passion. I was going to sign Indi up to obedience school and I was on my local area's obedience school's site. It said that we needed to bring along a choker chain. I soon changed my mind!    Edit: What's with all the thumbs-down?|`|9ZvQCpHPaa	No I love them  That's how i discipline my Doggie  Im just kidding i hate them they should be illegal.|`|hoeN5xP0aa	I don't use them personally, but if you guys think that a choke chain is bad, google "prong collar" , and look at the explanation and the pictures.|`|d1f75cf3fc1631ae6a75a97bc9eabe2caa	a choke chain work if the handler uses it properly the dogs have to be chastised if they are difficult always make sure it releases immediately applied  the dog will get used to it .I hope  this has helped|`|KIAreU3uaa	well, I don't know about choker chains but I know I hate them. I didn't wear them but it looks so uncomfortable.They remind me of Goths.|`|2lr92gVgaa	Yes.  I think that anyone who wants to use one on their dog should have it used on them first.|`|3zeDR9g6aa	I don't hate choke chains, I hate the fact that they are used.  There is no need to punish a dog in order to train, it's an old myth contradicted by science. Of all the tools of punishment the choke chain is far and away the most dangerous; it is a noose made of metal which lays across the throat. It can damage the trachea, the esophagus, the vagus nerve (which controls a number of bodily functions) etc. The folks who insist that it is harmless, or harmless when used correctly generally have no idea how to train without one.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Yep cant stand them and if anyone has to use them to train a dog - they aint much of a trainer in the first place IMO.  Another quick fix method.|`|oiKtuj5aaa	You obviously do not know how to properly use a choke chain. When used properly, they are for quick correction. A dog should never be walking and 'choking' at the same time. When used properly they are a very useful training tool.|`|R2iEAIcRaa	yes they are inhumane|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I currently use a half check to exercise one of my Dobermanns & if used correctly it is anything but cruel. The handler simply gives a quick check correction, followed by an immediate release.     It is certainly more humane than continually yanking on a dog's neck.    I have used a fine choke collar to show my Dobermann, but not for training purposes.|`|vPde97E2aa	NOT being an ignorant cry-baby AR-brainwashed KID,of course I don't!!!|`|J9AvKefwaa	They were used a lot back in the 1980's Barbra Woodhouse used to use them...   These days no one recommends them, I don't think I have seen many being used, if any at all! Good job too! Who wants to choke their dog anyway?|`|XxU94aKlaa	The correct name is actually a check chain and if your dog is choking on one it means your using it wrong. There's no reason for a dog to be pulling and choking themselves on these collars, and that seems to be the only way you see them used anymore.  Like any training device it can only work if the individual using it actually knows how to use it. Heck a crate could be a horrible tool of torture for a dog if used incorrectly (those people that lock their dogs in there for hours per day because they can't deal with them is a good example).    As for prong collars that someone brought up- I put one on myself before I put one on my dog, they pinch and aren't what one would consider painful. Again it comes down to using the tool correctly.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I use a Prong Collar and I am proud of it.

Either way, both conditions are potentially fatal.  Take your dog to your vet or an emergency clinic NOW.

AA12083992	At nine weeks he probably can not hold himself all night. Here are some house training tips and sites for crate training. The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck  three websites on how to crate train a puppy    http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info...          http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....       http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_c...|`|p3vjvzRPaa	He will sleep longer as time goes on, yes.    But if you are giving in to him already, and comforting him when he whines, he is learning how to wrap you around his little paw.  From his point of view good things happen when he cries.    I always tell my new puppy owners to invest in some ear plugs for the first few nights - the puppy will complain at sleeping alone (after being used to sleeping with littermates).  If you 'give in', you're establishing habits for life.    Your idea of teaching him to stay in the crate for longer periods is a good one.  You want to associate the crate with lots of positive things.      He is also too young to manage to hang on all night, so the crate may not be the best set up for overnight at the moment.  Your idea of the pen sounds promising.  Chances are he will cry at first there too, especially if he's learned that it gets him attention.    How about you chat with your neighbours about it and explain that it's short-term and that he'll learn to keep quiet soon.  Offer them some ear plugs and a peace offering of some kind maybe.|`|DXh2BlCraa	Crate training a puppy is not going to be all smooth sailing. Almost all puppies will fuss and cry the first few times they're confined to their crates. Remember, they want to be right next to you at all times. If you take little Fido out as soon he starts whining I can guarantee he'll whine even louder and longer next time. Anyone who's raised children will know all about this phenomenon! Stay close by but ignore the racket and don't make eye contact.|`|AA11821715	Puppies have an extreme amount of energy at this age. The closed door i dont think would work, the puppy will get scared. have you tried putting the crate in your bedroom? he might feel safer sleeping in the same room as you and will stay quiter.   Yes he will sleep longer as time goes on, also he is in a new enviornment (only been there a week) and he will get more used to his surrounding as time goes on, and it will get better.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	For crying out loud you people...arrgg...he is a BABY. Of course he doesn't want to be locked in a cage. He wants to be with you who is the only security he has. Get him a stuffed toy and wrap a ticking clock and put it under the stuffed toy. This might work. Or let him walk around your bedroom and dangle your arm over the side so he can feel you are there but not be in bed with you. Yeah I know its uncomfortable but if you have a baby then you have to suffer for a while. It isn't natural for the puppy not to whine for a few nights and I am trying to suggest things that will get you past the whining thing as I understand about the apartment deal. But you have to understand that he cant be made to conform because it isn't convenient to you. You will have to put yourself out a little too. Normally I would say let him whine for a few nights and he will get over it but as you cant try the other suggestions. And also realize that as he is a baby and not developed in many ways including his urinary functions that he cant be confined for long periods of time in a cage. He needs to be taken out at least every few hours including at night in order to train him to be clean at night and to stretch his legs and play. Welcome to puppy parenthood.|`|AA11602064	I took my puppy home at 5 1/2 weeks cause his mum had rejected him, i decided at the beginning not to use a crate, so he was left in the living room to sleep and i just blocked of wires etc, so he had full run off living room, toys, food, water etc, could amuse himself all night.    For the first 2 nights i went and explained to neighbour just a few nights he would cry and apologised for the noise, so one night he sat and howled ALL night, i was tearing my hair out and didnt get a wink of sleep. since that one night he has never made a noise.    Do not get up NO MATTER WHAT and he will soon learn. xx|`|HEyodpPSaa	I really dont want to offend you, but the best thing you can do is burn the crate and any other confinement device. Your dog is going to grow up thinking he must have a retreating box or place to hide every time anything frightens it in the slightest way.lightening, neighbors making nosie etc? Not only is this very unhealthy, it completely takes the fun out of owning him. And why would he even be allowed in a crate when youre home? He should be at your side in everything you do. Ive heard people say little dogs need this? WRONG! Precisely because of their size, they need to be exalted and made to feel proud.  Let him know, nothing in his home needs to be feared. Until he stops hiding, dont give him access to places to hide. (closets etc) If you see him retreat or hide because of something, go get him immediately and put him in your lap, or put him on the couch or chair and teach him every time to go there. This will help him get over these sensless fears and make him realize he can stay out and remain unharmed.   You need to understand how he looks at that crate. He thinks, without it, or when hes not in it, he is not safe. The very act of running to the crate and leaving the crate instills a sense of fear in him. Every time somethign rouses his senses, he's panicking and thinking about the stupid crate. (Should I leave, should I stay, should I run to my crate? Is that noise a reason to go to my crate? What if something gets me while I;m in the crate?) You see, these things are running through his mind, and its what makes him whine, bark etc. He needs to feel like the whole apartment itself is his crate and he has no reason to be nervous or whine when he is at home.  We rescued a Shih Tzu who was treated in this manner, and to date, (10 years later) she recedes into or under anything she can find at the slightest incident or noise. Shell sit in their shivering in fear until she decides things might be okay? What kind of life is that for any animal? Contrarily, we have two other tiny dogs that we have taught to fear nothing in the home. Nothing sets them off and if they do get scared they come to us, as they should. Consider or please try to do something different. Once you get him feeling safe,he'll stop whining and or barking.  At nine weeks I guess you havent got him potty trained yet? In an apartment youll probably be best using the paper method next to whatever door you take him out. Always have a few layers of newspaper at the door. If you find a mess (not at the paper) when you get home take him to the mess first, making sure he sees it, and that he knows youre very disappointed in him. Never use your hand/foot or anything else on him to punish him. Always have a light weight newspaper rolled up, and wrap him gently on the butt if he messes while you're home. Remember, its not pain you want to cause; its embarrassment. Most dogs have a built in sense to want to make you happy. Make up a routine for every time he messes in the house.   Take him outside, passing by and pointing out the newspaper at the door. Do this a few times and then sit down with him at the mess. If youre not there when he makes the mess, take him to the mess when you get home, (nicely) and get down on the floor with him and like a horse whisperer would, and have a long talk with him; Continuously (re) pointing his head to his mess. Dont let him turn away. Make these times long and consistent. Dont do it for one mess and then ignore other messes. Eventually you will start to see a sense of shame on his face and you will find he will start doing something different, or stopping the messes altogether. If he switches to messing in a hiding spot or a piece of furniture or whatever, start the process over again until you see his shame in that scenario.Youre trying to convince him to, in the least, use the newspaper at the door. Eventually, he will hopefully make the connection that he should and he can, hold it until you get home. When you are home, spend as much time as possible outside with him. Some dogs will just automatically get to the point where they wont want to relieve themselves anywhere but outside.    Nonetheless, please get rid of crates, keep closet doors and small rooms closed, and teach your dog, next to you, he is second in command of "his" palace. Then, he will most assuredly be your best friend, and would never consider messing up your home, and of course, he will have no reason to run around whining and worrying while you're gone or sleeping.
kWwgWSSgaa	My current two year old male Dobermann is entire. He has a solid recall, never roams & has a stable temperament. The health benefits for castrating a male are not as compelling as for a b*tch, so I currently have no intention of castrating him.     Neutering has never altered my previous male Dobermanns temperaments, but then again I never thought it would.    Training rather than neutering changed their behaviour.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Memphis Belle is completely correct in what she says.  Neutering is not a magic bullet to cure bad behaviours.  With training, it can help in some though.      Your slightly nippy and cheeky puppy is just that, a puppy.  He needs to be trained but I do think that in your circumstances neutering is a very good option.|`|J9AvKefwaa	I have a female, she was spayed at 6 months, the only difference I noticed with her was that she became greedier and more prone to wt gain. Its very common for castrated dogs to gain weight.|`|AA11097657	Yes it is 6 months.    There are so many benefits from having dogs castrated and none for not having them done.    It stops strong smelling urine ( marking )  No dominance  No mounting other dogs or fighting  No wandering off when females are in season.    What more can I say apart from the fact that one of my rescue dog's was evil when I got him. Castrated him and now he is a ***** cat.|`|ae54b4a7f13587570ec2a88d765bbedeaa	My puppy was fixed at 7 months. It really made a hugh difference with the house training.

Either way just do it, no one can tell you for sure what your dog is going to be like after its done.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Yes, it makes them more docile and less likely to roam.

On a side note though, if he started getting aggressive, he'd be there in a snip... no pun intended. =P|`|AA12083992	They are not as aggresive after being neutered. There are also great health benefits.     WHAT BEHAVIORAL CHANGES CAN BE EXPECTED AFTER NEUTER?    The only behavior changes that are observed after neutering relate to behaviors influenced by male hormones. Playfulness, friendliness, and socialization with humans are not changed. The behaviors that change are far less desirable. The interest in roaming is eliminated in 90% of neutered dogs. Aggressive behavior against other male dogs is eliminated in 60% of neutered dogs. Urine marking is eliminated in 50% of neutered male dogs. Inappropriate mounting is eliminated in 70% of neutered dogs.  http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_can...    Less Testosterone, Less Trouble    In terms of behavior, male dogs will benefit even more than females from being neutered. Neutering, or castration, is the surgical removal of the animal's testicles. An unneutered male can detect a female in heat even miles away. Neutering decreases roaming by 90%. Responding to the overwhelming urge to reproduce, he will often become nervous and irritable, perhaps picking fights with other dogs, or become lethargic, less responsive to his owner, stop eating, or act ill or depressed. Among the problems reduced or eliminated by neutering male pets are:  Territoriality and aggression, including urinating to mark territory, and fighting to defend it  Wandering, escaping, and automobile injuries  "Riding" inappropriate objects  Prostate enlargement (occurs in at least 60% of unneutered male dogs 5 years or older)  Prostate tumors and infections  Tumors of the testicles, penis, anal area  Perineal hernia (rupture of the posterior abdominal wall)  Stress, leading to increased susceptibility to disease  Need for extra food  http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html|`|s9haCi64aa	Yes it made him concerntrate more in our training lessons and stopped other dogs attacking him.    I think castrating your dog is fantastic but be warned this might not change the problems your experiencing. I would seriously get him into training classes.|`|bH1DYr5saa	We had our spaniel done as soon as he was 6 months old to try and reduce his aggression! I didn't work...although for all I know maybe it did and he would have been a lot worse if he wasn't done!    I would highly recommend having it done anyway, there are huge health benefits to your dog. My only warning would be that because we had our dog done as soon as he was 6 months old, it ruined his coat a little bit - he's 11 now and there are still patches of his body that grows fluffy puppy fur instead of coarse adult fur! He was never going to be a show dog anyway so was never really a problem.

The post-op care is minimal, and apart from walking on the leash for 10 days and not letting him off, he is back to his normal self - he was a bit doped up last night but all recovered now.
Wn0Hj7H4aa	Not as many wrecks as you where i've been injured  but then maybe i've been more careful /or lucky.Worst for me was when a buckskin mare i was trail riding on flushed a pheasant from  under her belly and went straight up ( the horse not the bird ) about 6 feet ,swapped ends and came down in the same spot she jumped from. I had one foot out of the stirrup and rapped around the horn at the launch and came down in a different area and broke my forearm and one finger ,this was from using the same for a pillow on landing.Sally ( the horse ) thought the whole thing rather amusing.Just goes to show you one moment of relaxing and Mr Murphy shows up. Oh Well it's the way it goes. Oh and one more ---thats funny at a stable i was working at one time i was carrying a bale of alfalfa to a feeding trough when a horse that was tied snorted  broke free and ran over me ( just bruises ) afterwords i heard the boss say to a friend " Don't worry thats a gentle horse he just never saw a bale of hay walk before.|`|cGRyDCpQaa	Have been pretty lucky, but I know I'll get hurt a lot worse in the future.

The worst was a jumping accident over the summer. My gelding buckled on the landing and threw over his head. I landed square on my head, the bystanders said they could hear my helmet crack on the ground. Then my horse went into a forward roll and slammed me into the ground as he rolled over my head, neck, and upper body. It resulted in a concussion, a broken orbital bone, cracked ribs, eight stitches in my chin, and various abrasions. The worst part was my broken orbital made my eye unstable in its socket, so I couldn't sneeze or get hit in the head lest my eye pop out. YUCK!    I've also broken my foot when a horse slipped loping and wiped out on top of me.    I got dragged after I fell off a minnie horse cause my leg was stuck over his fat belly, Very funny, very painful.    I got thrown on my head (again) and slid on my back into the back of another horse while running a speed game and my saddle cinch broke. There are two cracks on the back of my helmet where they collided with the hooves of the second horse.    I slipped sideways on my horse and then was separated from my mount as I met a solid object and he kept running.    A stallion threw me over his shoulder when he bolted and when I opened my eyes I had time to watch his feet pass inches by my face as he ran by.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Ive broken my toe, thats the only broken bone I've had from horses.    But I guess my worse injury went like this. I was at a schooling day for this local farm- they have a great crosscountry course, and you and your trainer would go around and school it. It was going great. Anyways, there was this training level hanging log fence, and I was kinda spooked by it. (It was also uphill going into the woods) He felt that, and was like no way. So he ran out. Then my trainer had me go at it again- only she didnt let me sit to the fence, just stay up in 2 point. Which would be fine, but I was already spooked by it (Although I never said anything so she didnt know) , I feel less secure in a 2 point, and my horse responds better when he knows where your seat is. So, we went at it 2 more times like that, and the third I went off. I hit the fence, hard,  which was a very SOLID hanging log. I mean, I've fallen loads of times, but this was the worst. I hit it with my hip, mostly. My horse, to his credit, stood around for 10 sec or so before it clicked that he was free in a large field. They took me back to the trailers, although I almost passed out on the way and my vision was funky for about 10 min (I swear I only saw in blues and yellows) and apparantly I was as pale as a sheet.  Anyways, I couldnt walk for a few days, not really, couldnt run or ride for a few weeks. For the first week or so,I t took me about 10 min to manuvere myself out of bed, if I could lol.  I Even when I could ride, for a good month afterwards, I had to either grit my teeth and avoid the trot or drug myself up.  It sucked. And it was a real blow to both of our confidences- I mean, I couldnt get back on him then and jump him or anything.  So, yeah. That's it- I think I've done pretty well overall. I mean, I'm only 15, but most of my friends have already broken their wrist, arm, leg, ect...|`|YdJgrgvdaa	well my first fall was when i was doing trotting/ cantering without stirrups, i was coming back to trot and i could feel myself tilting forward, then i fell over the horse's shoulder and she accidentally clipped my face with her hoof. Then another time i was riding a 7 yr old, he hadn't had much done with him and was very green, he was going nicely then we popped a small cross jump and then for no apparent reason he started having a bucking fit. I lost balance and fell off, i was winded and my bum hurt, i couldn't sit down for days, this was my worst fall.|`|6j4igZ9Haa	The ones I remember most - two broken arms, broken wrist, concussion, I got winded once when I feel off and landed on my back not being able to move as my horse jumped right over me, very scarey, kicked in the thigh twice (once while riding and once leading) and a near miss with a kick to the head. I was very lucky on that last one. I had tons of falls and near misses, too many really lol! I stopped counting after a while. This one horse bucked me off about 15 times in one day, luckily I was ok but we found out later she had had a twisted vertibrae poor thing.    I had to laugh at that one about the walking bale someone posted, very funny|`|4KY26xQqaa	What have I been though!!! FAR TOO MUCH LOL!  Still... Have to love emm!  I'm breaking in a full crazy TB at the mo, he is actully alot better but within the last few months I have got sailing over his neck and broken one of the arena lights, I got cuts bruises and a sprained ankle. Been bucked into a hedge out hacking, scratches. Cracked my head off the jump wings, stictches in right eyebrow.   That's probably about that with him. Today I fell in the ice and landed in poo, but thats not indury just hurts your pride LOL!  But last year I broke my Wrist, Collar Bone and also slipped a disc (VV PAINFUL!!!)   But other than that I'm doing great, my worst this week is I now have steri-stip along my arm after a plastic bag went soaring past a spooky horse on a hack, I slit my arm on stones and grazed it.  I'm an accident waiting to happen!!!  I've also got a broken pinkie toe after I got in the way of Tia who was wanting into her field! Oh Well life goes on LOL!|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Touch wood I have been very lucky!!! Have sustained 3 "horsey" injuries, but all on the ground.  Not that I don't ever come off, just didn't do any damage! I broke my wrist when I was getting my mare out of the field while trying to keep a load of colts in and slipped,  Broke 3 ribs when I crashed my chest into a portuguese saddle whilst dismounting and the horse spooked and jumped in the air and my dear mare broke two ribs in the field when she got a bit over-excited and slammed her head into me.|`|ihyM9j8laa	Me and my best friend went off one day and found some jumps, never rode these ponies before thought it be funny to see if they cud jump(as you do wen your young) anyway hers did it so off i went mine jumped that high i flew in the air landed flat on me back, then out of nowhere a little old woman came out wiv a shot gun poked me wiv it un told me i was trespassing,looking round all i cud see was 2 ponies off like the wind wiv lainy laughing her socks off. Lesson to be learned( pick the pony that doesnt throw you off) Hahahahaha. worst one had to be going to a jump pony stopped i didnt landed on other side of it then the pony thought oh i should of done that and did hitting me in the head and neck, i was out for the count for several hours but luckily nothing broken,just massive bruises and a lot of pain|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	I've been pretty lucky the worse thing that happened to me is that I went head first into a wooden fence and got a fat lip... that sucked trying to get the splinter out though hahaha|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I had a large Warmblood with severe issues and I was overmounted. I don't remember what happened but obviously I ate dirt. I had a concussion for two weeks because I was knocked out for several minutes and I tore my labrum which required surgery to repair.    Got back on tho!    My trainer was kicked by a horse and had both bones in her forearm broken. She was in shock and didn't move right away so when the owner jerked the stud chain the horse kicked her right in the gut. Her spleen exploded, her stomach ruptured. She died three times on the way to the hospital and she was in physical therapy for over a year. She was  7 in the country with her horse in 2007. :)|`|F0nRMmmlaa	A horse spooked at a snake in the pasture and I swung around her neck and she galloped off! I held on with my life because if I would have let go she would have trampled me!!!! Her reins finally got caught on the fence and I sat down!!! I was so scared!!!!|`|5RRMLzvzaa	I'm pretty lucky so far - mild concussion, a broken finger, chipped teeth, huge lump on my head, that's it.  knock on wood!|`|AA10776535	I got buck off and landed on my head but... a couple of days ago i was leading a horse trying to teach my nephew how to and we were going through the corral gate and i took the other end of the lead and kinda flicked it up out of my way...well the nephew grabs it mid air and pulls, scares the horse, the horse pulls and my fingers got caught between the lead rope and pipe corral.  Broke my fingers badly, im typing one handed LOL  My mom witnessed this and wanted to shoot the horse,  I told her it wasn't the horse fault it was my nephews shoot him LOL  (FYI mom would never shoot a horse, she is a kind soul who doesn't like me getting hurt, she says this every time i come up bleeding LOL)|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Got bucked off a horse(not his fault-first ride, everything went well, then I decided to ask for a "little bit more", STUPID!) and broke several vertebrate in my back.  Didn't know it for several years though, until I got xrayed when I got hurt(worst being a concussion that gave me amnesia-it wasn't funny) being run over by a mare who didn't want to be bred, and they asked me how long ago I'd broken my back(it was healed)...    Got a bad concussion when I was riding my pony bareback as a kid. Was just walking down the trail, a bird came out of a bush fast behind my pony, ran into her butt, which caused to her very unexpectedly go from walking placidly to jumping straight forward about 10 feet. I went straight backwards, no chance to even try to stay on it was that fast, and landed with the back of my head on a big rock. Thank goodness I had on a top of the line helmet-which was busted in half. I had a headache for two weeks afterwards. Without the helmet, it would have been my skull and brains busted on that rock-I wouldn't be here. Thank you mom and dad for forcing me to wear that thing at all times!|`|AA12279950	Yup, dropped off many a time.  Been quite lucky though.  Worse injury was a broken little finger!  Horse was bitten by a horse fly, went nuts and tried to get rid of me.  I held on for dear life and got my finger twisted in the reins and the horses mane.  Didn't realise it was broken for three days.  Hey ho.|`|TM2uTrfXaa	I was thrown and knocked unconcious and herniated the c4 disk that ended up needing surgery disk replacement and fusion. To this day it still hurts and I love my horses to death but have not ever gotten over this and have a fear to ride now. Its been 8 years. I dont have that horse anymore and my horse that I do have Ive owned her 8 years and I do trust her. Just have anxiety fear that I have to get over. I am gonna get lessons from the man that is breaking my mares baby when he is done. That should do the trick hopefully!! ;)|`|3qeHMWW2aa	I've had a few nasty accidents although one of the most painful was getting hooked on a barbed wire fence when I was breaking a pony that decided to ditch me.      Worst Injury's are probably   1) Horse slipped with studs on turning for a fence, landed on me and ran over me and just missed my rib bones - concussion, fractured leg and stitches  2) Going through a bridal path gate which was on a  spring so snapped back and trapped us in the gate. Cut my shin badly and I had a 2 hour ride back to the road :( - just stitches  3) Coming off a pony that somehow managed to run out of a bounce fence kept hold and slid across the showground on my butt - fractured coccyx.    Why do we keep doing to ourselves? xx|`|g62woUDQaa	I guess nothing really serious....just big, bloody, and messy....  First one, years ago my friends and I would ride around looking for any down log to jump over.  Found one such log, it was late in the day and lighting wasn't the best....didn't see the branch pointing towards us.  Took it in the thigh, horse went on over, impact threw her off and we went down and rolled on the other side of the log.  Deep, deep puncture wound, about 3" across, and we were about 1 1/2 hours away from the trailer and a ride home.  Being the type that really hates doctor visits, I hid out when I got home, slapped a wrap on it, and figured all would be well.  Wound up with a trip to the doc the next day when I passed out in the car.  Laid up for several weeks due to the muscle damage.  Not fun.    Second one, got into bees, horse took great exception to this, and took off running through the woods.  Since I was fighting him to regain control, he never saw the drop off into a dry creek bed, and we flipped over into it.  He landed on top of me and rolled on over.  Knocked out, huge gaping hole in the back of my head that required 19 staples to close up.  Again, about 2 miles away from the horse camp, and my horse kept going.  Insisted that the majority of the crew go on and find my horse, and one gal and I walked back to camp.  Shock is a wonderful thing.....didn't hurt on the whole walk back.....later however, it wasn't too great.|`|1bRRODd2aa	My worst injury was probably my first bad fall. The pony bolted and after about 4 miles and managing to pull the pony into a gate way (sudden stop) I fell off sideways and ended up with a broken wrist and broken ankle.    After that, I pretty much learned the trick of landing on my feet when falling off...    The other fall that had potentially catastrophic consequences was when I landed on my head when the horse fell at a jump, she tried to bank the jump and got a foot caught.  I was wearing a hard hat, so the only damage was a 3" hole in the hat from the flint I landed on...  We both jumped the same jump again, that time she cleared it by about 3 feet!    I've had a couple of other falls that should have been far more serious than they turned out to be, but mostly I've been lucky...|`|hHndD5SEaa	Ok - Im kinda weird when it comes to falling - I rarely fall off - but when I do I come a cropper! In my 30 years of riding Ive only ever fallen off about 8 times - and every time I have Ive had some lovely injuries:    Fall 1- shattered my finger - even to this day its still swollen and weak    Fall 2 - Fell off - hit my face on the ground and broke my jaw - had my teeth wired together for 6 weeks    Fall 3 - Broken ribs - fell and smashed all my right hand side ribs    Fall 4 - Brain damage/coma for two months! - wasnt wearing a hat and fell and ended up on life support for 2 months with swelling of the brain - but I came round and much to my parents horror went back riding again!!    The other three falls have just been bruising and stuff but I think you'll agree Ive taken some spectacular falls eh!!? Heres to my next one!   xx|`|R18QC1yfaa	Fell of alot but never actually hurt myself...soft landing maybe ??!!  I'm sure i'll have plenty more to look forward too though|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I just turned 11. Four days after Christmas. Bought my mare back in Oct, new rider, green-broke-as it turned out-but professional trained horse (she would be trained, sit in a stall for 6mo to a year and re trained for 30 days. Pattern repeated til she was 4 and half).     She reared up, lost footing, we both went back wards and she feel directly on top of my left side on the ground.    1) Two broken ribs.    2) Bruised Spinal Injury (they thought I was paralyzed because I couldn't move for awhile).    3) Collapse lung.    4) Two broken areas on pelvic (which later x-ray a month later showed a third crack).    I was unconscious for a few minutes and woke up to my step dad holding up my head trying to talk to me crying. My step sister, a friend (who later was my English trainer) and a few others walked back to the stables (about a mile and half out) watching them pony my mare and step dad's horse with them, so he can go with me in the ambulance.    The news was there, then the fire department, then the ambulance. My mom was back at the stables and thought my step dad was hurt and I rode with them. In fact, she really panic when found it was me.    She was going to sell my mare, but the social worker at the hospital said that I needed my mare to heal not just physically but emotionally too.    Just so happens a lady who lives behind the stables is a barrel trainer and she took me and my mare under her wings for a long while.  I was on my horse with in a month (crying and hurting, but stubborn) secretly. Yelled at a few times by doctors and my mom oh and my trainer!      The second worst injury:     My left hand was mangled. Skin (sever rope burn) was torn off the palms and fingers. I had all finger nails off or half off on all fingers accept my index next to my thumb.    My pinki was badly broke and now has developed athritis.    I was trying my mare (this is like 4 years later from  1) to the horse trailer while my step dad got her 4 month foal out of the trailer.    We took them to the place we used to board at and bred her so the stallion owner can see the new foal.  Idiot did not put up the stallion that his stall was open up into the arena directly. We was parked directly near the arena.    Stallion came running in arena, my mare flipped out (as so did her foal), she pulled back as I had the lead rope in the horse trailer loops. When she pulled back (sat like a dog extending her neck back and forth),  she tighten the rope around my hand and pulled my hand directly through the loop, which I can't fit my hand in there in all originality. So you can tell....I was in alot of pain.    The worst part of that, I had to go back home, drop the horses and trailer, drop my whiney step brother at his friends before they can take me to the emergancy room!    Some tips from other injuries I had:    If riding on pavement, to help ease any road rashs is to make sure have long sleeve t-shirts, Jeans and in winter, I bundle up in leather (my harley jacket I wear on our motorcycles) etc.     If riding in water, to help ease the thought of drowning or being caught in something....make sure no shopping carts, fishing nets/lines/hooks and make sure the current is safe to be in.  If the water is calm on top, doesn't mean the water is calm below!  Do not swim or take your horse near a water gate drainage sysem (have those bars etc). Horse's hoofs can be draped. Depend on current, horse can be sucked under.  Oh and no tie downs in water.    If trying to catch a horse and pin them in a corner. Let the horse face you side ways. Not attempt to approach a horse from behind. If approaching from infront, best to have the horse be sides as the front is more dangerous to be trampled on if they move/run forward.    If your horse rears up, try to get off before the horse goes all the way up. (hence, my situation).     If thrown off, heavy dirt is your friend. Sand and thorns is not.|`|X3bu0B8faa	Lets see, kicked, bit, knocked down, broken,launched- But none as bad as my Friend and Trainer Devin Warren. He was doing a favor for a Friend of a Friend and tuning up a horse before the Paint world show. The horse lost it and slam dunked Devin face first in the dirt. He smashed his pretty face and was out of the riding arena for a long time. You can read his interview in March's PHJ. He still can't smell things. I don't know how he got the moxie to crawl back on, but he did. I woulda renamed the horse Alpo and sold out!|`|nIV0oAGNaa	My worst Horse injury has been when  i was out on a hack with 2 of my friends when a loud bang when off from a gun (Someone was shooting rabbits near by) and the horse i was riding spun round reared up and bucked throwing me into a river that used to be a river but it dried out and had pipes in it i broke both my shoulder blades,1 of my scapula,s, 1 humeras, both radius,s , My Fibia and Tibia in my right leg, My heel in my left leg and my ankle in my left leg but I,m perfect now.  I,ve Broken my Ulna On my first time jumping and lost balance.  I broke my Patella when a Exmoor Kicked I,ve had lots of injuries in my time riding but it,s all part of the excitement of horses there,s danger involved.|`|sLhwyMw9aa	got stamped on broke my foot, got thrown off huge big bruise on my bum, got knocked out and saw stars, got kicked in the shin now that hurt, broke my arm and wrist. got bitten on my breast, don't we just love em, slipped on ice with a bucket and broke a finger.  but wouldnt change a thing in my life except i now have arthrittis pretty badly all those wet cold days and broken bones getting there own back.  ride carefully love your horses x|`|EaNjIhoQaa	I have been very blessed not to have broken any bones while riding or handling horses. The worst fall I had was on a little 11 hand pony. He likes grass.....A LOT!   I was on him outside the arena and he dove and veered so suddenly that it knocked me off balance. I fell off and heard something crack in my neck. I didn't give it any thought and I got back on. And 2 minutes later he did it again and my wrist caught me. I heard a loud crack in my wrist. That was about a month ago and to this day my wrist still doesn't feel right. Of course I was supposed to go for an x-ray but who has the time...lol.    God bless and stay safe!|`|yQFdBj3haa	The worst I've suffered is when I was walking my gelding out, he spooked at something bucked and tried to take off. I was right behind him when he bucked and he nearly broke my leg, I couldn't walk properly. It wasn't his fault though. I had a bruise in a hoof shape on my leg for weeks and a possible hairline fracture.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	A huge dutch warm blood mare decided to try jumping two bounce fences together and did not quite make the second one and I landed underneath and she landed on top of me!  Somewhere in the middle were all the poles!  We made a massive dent in the school surface and I was extremely badly bruised!    Another time, trying to catch a couple of horses in a field, a mare got jealous and had a huge chunk out of my right breast!  The man whom I was with at the time laughed until he cried and then told everybody in the yard who would or would not listen that this horse, she has very good taste!|`|CLntHVQtaa	Three spring to mind, only one actually falling off.   I shredded all the ligaments in my foot and ankle when I came off over a fence. Many months on crutches!  Cut through to the tendon between my thumb and forefinger when I got a knife stuck in a swede trying to put it on a string for my little cob.  Needed stitches etc in a head injury when I got stuck between two geldings fighting to come in from the field in a storm - they reared at each other, and one came down with his front teeth on the top of my head. That came quite keen.|`|FuDHZPpNaa	I onced tripped over some dust.|`|AA10886678	i fractured my pelvis last may after falling off my arab during jumping - had to have 8 weeks off work to heal and it hurt so much!    have also cracked ribs, bruised bones (hand bones are terrible), had black eyes and sprained ankles!    have had two horses fall on top of me and if it wasnt for body protectors etc i would have been much worse off!    i think i am less adventurous these days cos of all the pains i have been through - i dont like breaking in horses anymore!|`|f013bc0acf73d0e66a02a1e4ea359bc2aa	I was riding a horse in a race, when the horse galloping upsides me lashed out and kicked my shin.  I finished the race but couldn't jump off the horse as my lower leg was dangling loosely.  My shinbone was broken.  I went to the hospital and despite the agony, insisted they didn't cut off my boots (well they were new ones).  My boot was full of blood and had a lovely horse shoe shaped gash in it, as did my jodphurs and socks (and leg).    I'm not very squeamish, and watched the doctor pick bits of bone from my leg and replant them into my shin and glue and sew it all together.  I have a lovely scar and still have the boots with the hole in them.|`|zMXDolD9aa	Hmm, i think my worst was having cracked ribs and almost having my braces ripped out when i fell off once. I've landed on concrete before aswell.   Ohh, i've fallen off twice in one day and off two different horses! How bad is that? I sound really bad lol.  And of course, knocked confidence!|`|KFXjRpnFaa	Wow sounds like you've had fun haha.  I was jumping my horse five years ago and he stopped at the jump and bucked (yes how kind of him) so i jumped it on my own and landed on my head, fracturing my neck. Another time i was riding a different horse and she took off across the field bronching (a pretty powerful freisan lol) i ended up on the floor, this time with a BROKEN neck.   Oh yes and last year my lovely horse decided to roll in the mud while i was on board. So not only did i have a broken leg but also the hospital wasn't too pleased with me being so muddy haha.  Some other incidents involve getting kicked in the stomach - just bruised, knocked out by hindquarters, trodden on countless times etc etc.  im sure the list will continue lol|`|Vlg2PXFJaa	Ha Ha Ha!!!  I sooooooo know the feeling! Probably my worst was when my trainer was saying to my mother what a fantastic partnership my horse and I had when she bucked me off and knocked me out! I thought it was a dream only to wake up on the grass with my trainer and mother staring down at me in a flap.  Yeah, i had really bad concusion!!!!  More then anything for me though its just the embaressment!! I had this devil horse who was just really ivasive and she through me off at a horse show and galloped bucking and rearing into the first ridden class! with me running behind like a headless chicken to get back on!   Having spent all my warm up time tring to catch my pony I then had to try and jump my course having not warmed up! she bucked me off in the jumping but we still got back on and made her do it!  Ha Ha-she was a character!(I think I was a little too ambitious!|`|6EP7ILr3aa	Ive only ever fallen of 2 different horses , and never my own. The first one was a welsh pony called Blue. She was so naughty that on hacks she would randomly start walking backward then rear. Lookily i was only 7 and also was very fearless so i wasnt bothered and got straight back on, although the bruises were hurendos. Then only 4 months ago i was riding a school horse on one of my last rides out before i got my own horse. It was a normal day, mild weather and we were just walking on a road following all the other horses. Then suddenly for no apparent reason he slipped and went to the floor. It was so sudden i had no time to braise myself and i flew off. I landed smack-bang on my back. We realised later that Dunken(the horse) had scraped his nose and graised his fetlock. It took 10minites to get up from my pssition on the floor and after i had got up i was fine, weard because before it felt like i was paralised before. I got back on the horse and rode him back to the stables even managing a gallop in a field, even though i was extreemly stiff. I still havnt completely recovered from that fall as a few days later my back seazed up and still now i cant lie or sit in certain positions.|`|0y84ZF1Jaa	i now have 7 screws a pin and a plate in one arm and no feeling in the other and i cant use it  teeth kicked out boken bones lost count slipped disks put in a wheelchair told id never walk again let alone ride bin thrown over a 40ft drop in to a river TWICE over buses barbed wire etc the list goes on but wat the hell i still get on the buggers haha|`|NJdupXBKaa	I have been quite lucky never to have anything major!  But I have been bucked off my old horse and he stood on my stomach. I only had very bad bruising though.   I also fell off my friends horse while jumping. (He got his strides wrong and I wasn't the greatest rider). I hit my head and got knocked out for a while and had a fairly bad concussion.   I have had allot on other little injuries as well like broken toes lol.  Yeah we are mad to want to still carry on. Especially when you see some people. Shows how much dedication it takes to be a horse rider :P.  Great Question :)  xxx
JwYwsrTzaa	Every time we played fetch, Tank (100lb Amstaff/Mastiff) would chase the ball and at the last second pounce on it like a cat.    He also was not suppose to be on the couch. Every time we left, he would sleep on it. He would get off when he heard the garage door, but the throw pillows and blanket were always on the floor. The only time we could catch him was when we came in the front door. His front paws would be on the floor, but the rest was still getting off the couch.|`|tecPZUq2aa	I Take My 4 Month Old Scottie Owt In The Snow. She's So Small It Looked Like She Was Swimming!

The Cat's Diary    Day 983 of My Captivity        My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.        The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a "good little hunter" I am.         There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of "allergies." I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.        Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs.        I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird must be an informant. I observe him communicate with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now ...
1bRRODd2aa	Chloe is a cream, short or smooth haired Chihuahua    DO NOT get a Chihuahua if you just want a toy you can dress up.    Most Chihuahuas don't like being dressed up. They are strong, independent dogs, very energetic. They think they are BIG dogs and are brave enough to stand up for themselves against anything.    Because of this they do need "protecting" as they are vulnerable because of their size and can often find themselves in -deep- trouble.    They also tend to be a little stubborn and often take longer to train than other breeds.  Many can be very aggressive and possessive of their owners, especially when carried. These tendencies can be trained/socialized out of the dog but the training needs to be started young before these tendencies become set.    The white or cream colour is fairly readily available.     Please either rescue a dog or find a reputable breeder.  DO NOT even think about buying a pup from a BYB or a Puppy Mill.  No care is ever taken to breed for a good temperament and health by these places, you will end up with a very unpleasant dog.|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	The little white chi called Chloe was a white smooth coat. If you have a smooth coat parent and a long hair parent sometimes the pups are in between coats. This film will make many people want a chi, but please research the breed, they needs lots of time and attention, i have 9 chis and 3 poms so i am talking from experience. They dont like being drees up carried around, dont like being home alone.Needs lots of socialising  to meet people. They are great little dogs, but please read about them firts. Secondarly they cost around 1000 now, very rare you will find a chi in rescue centres, this is because the british chi club take them in straight away and rehome them to homes that they approve,  this is because they dont like cages/crates and dont take to kennels very well, need lots of attention.. You are more than welcome to visit my 360 to see my chis and on there is my flicki sites.  Hope this helps Maria|`|YRTYXfggaa	She's a shorthaired Chihuahua.  She's also normal looking, for her breed.  Try rescuing one, instead of buying one.  Many chihuahua's were purchased when the movie came out, and now, some people have decided they don't want them anymore because of the time and expense it takes to care for a dog.  It happens!  You fell for it!
YK8zJNluaa	8 weeks old is perfect to be left outside.  Don't let these morons tell you anything else.  They are an outside animal, so as long as you provide shelter, blanket and food and water, your little pup will do fine.  They are born outside and WILL live happily outside without ever stepping foot inside a house.    EDIT  sorry moron, oops racecar.  you are entitled to your opinion, but not when its wrong.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Dogs should never be left either inside or outside on their own all day. If you do this your dog will be come an unmanageable anti social hooligan.Perhaps you can come home at lunchtime or arrange flexi hours so that someone will be at home for a few hours during the day. There are also professionals who can take her for a walk, or doggy day creches.|`|0lcSi5tnaa	she's not to young given the proper shelter from this cold unless ur in a warm climate, but why not just put her in an indoor crate and let her out when you get home? people make owning dogs into something its not!|`|tecPZUq2aa	Ermm I Would Say At Around A Year Old :)|`|1bRRODd2aa	Don't even think about housing your dog outside until it is at least a year old.    In the mean time, get yourself a large crate and put the dog in it to sleep and when you have to leave the dog alone.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	8 weeks is way way too young - and I agree with others no dog should be left outside all day on its own whatever the age.  Why did you get this puppy in the first place?    Surely your top quality breeder would of told you all of this and included tips on house training etc?    If you are so worried about accidents try crate training but please dont think you can leave any puppy all day alone in a crate and think it wont have accidents!     As for the poster calling others names - do grow up please we all have the right to differ in opinions.,|`|d1f75cf3fc1631ae6a75a97bc9eabe2caa	Sorry My friend you should have thought it out try and arrange for a dog walker or some one to visit her if she does not bark you will be ok if not expect visits from the pet society . sorry|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	Shes a bit young at the moment - puppies need security in order to grow into confident happy dogs, She may get scared outside alone with no protector, strange noises/things (even in a secure area) - I would leave it till at least 6-7 months old - then maybe make it a gradual process and see how you get on.    Maybe think about crate training indoors for the time being. 8 weeks is young to expect her to be fully house trained anyway

XxU94aKlaa	Joy just what we need- another backyard breeder without a clue breeding Pitbulls, a breed that already has a horrible reputation and fills up shelters everywhere.    Step 1- Turn the caps lock off.  Step 2- Learn to type: "c," "dem," "2wice," and other such things are not words- We can't answer your question if we can't read it.  Step 3- Color has nothing to do with breed, an American Pitbull Terrier is an American Pitbull Terrier. There is no difference between "blue nose," "red nose," and what ever other flippen color nose people care to list.  Step 4- Get your dog fixed because you haven't got a clue- I'm so sick of seeing thousands of dogs put down every day because of people like you. Don't worry if she's pregnant or not- just get her fixed ASAP before you need to find out.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Larry please don't use all caps, because people think you are yelling.    Before worrying about breeding dogs you need to learn to spell  Was these dogs vet checked and tested for deformities before breeding, I mean if you were friends with a former breeder you should know that. And just so you know these dogs are mutts and should be fixed.|`|hoeN5xP0aa	First off, maybe type your question normally, it seems as though your caplock is stuck on; very annoying and you won't get answers this way.      *edit: The Expert; I think perhaps they are taking about a bluenosed pitbull terrier, unsure though, because all of the capitals have me a little frustrated!|`|JwYwsrTzaa	Be a responsible owner and get your dog fixed. So many dogs are put to sleep each year. You will only add to the already over population of dogs.    I love Aussie Mum's answer  :)  My favorite words are "answear" and "preagansy"  lol|`|ixutx59Daa	Get your dog spayed for God's sake.    Pit bulls are the most bred, abused and the first to be killed in shelters ... YOU want to contribute to that?????????????
XI2iylR4aa	I'm sorry about your sister's rabbit, that is so sad.    Did the two rabbits live together?  If they were bonded, the remaining rabbit will likely be depressed for a while.  Make sure she's eating and drinking enough.  Stressed out rabbits might stop eating and drinking, which leads to GI Stasis, which can be deadly.    I think it's a great idea to bring her inside.  I think she will appreciate it.  It will probably take a few weeks for her to adjust to all of the changes...new habitat, the loss of her friend, but I think she will be happy to be inside.    Here's a website about helping your rabbit deal with her loss:  http://www.rabbit.org/journal/2-1/loss-s...|`|sxTeKrjwaa	YOU SHOULD GIVE THE BUNNY A FRIEND

YRTYXfggaa	A few fun things i taught my dog:    Bow - easy to teach, they stretch like this!  Go Hide - he hides his head under the couch pillows.  Everyone loves it because he's so big, but he thinks nobody can see him!  Stick 'Em Up - he sits up and puts his front feet in the air  Are You Shy? - he covers his face with his paw  Don't Touch - you can put a treat right in front of him and tell him not to touch it, and he just stares at it and slobbers!  Then say OK for him to eat it.  Whisper - grunts, groans, anything besides a bark.  Sometimes, it sounds like sentences in another language!  LOL!    Have fun!|`|YkAPHmkSaa	you could try some ball tricks like get about 5 or 6 tennis balls (rubber balls for my staffie, he eats tennis balls in one bite!) and line them up on the ground while your dog is a few meters away and then flick them with a tennis raquet one at a time real quick and my boy catches spits out and catches next one etc and we are now up to 10 and getting faster every day! Your aiming has gotta be good for it to look real cool and we vary it with high catches and bounces and double bounces! have fun!|`|AyJ3xXgYaa	i am teaching my puppy to put her toys away, I will dump them and she puts them back in the box
hoeN5xP0aa	I'm unsure. It could just be that they are rare in Australia. We have certain dog breeds here in Canada where I am that are very hard to come by. But if you have your mind set on a patterdale, and thats what you want, don't settle for anything less, keep up the search!!! Good luck!|`|oGVWdnHraa	The Patterdale Terrier isnt recognised by the ANKC (Australian National Kennel Club), so there would be very little interest in this breed for dog enthusiasts, so I think your best bet would be to import one from an overseas breeder :)    Heres a list of recognised terrier breeds in Aus :)  http://www.ankc.org.au/home/breeds.asp?g...|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Did you happen to watch "Its Me or the Dog" yesterday.  Lottie, the little Patterdale Terrier (as identified by Victoria Stilwell) was really a gorgeous winsome little dog.

What a little livewire she was.|`|ojxOpAQmaa	i just gave had a search on yahoo, and found this site for you.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Cant help with the Aussie thing but patterdales are a tough little breed and very fiesty.  They are bred for working and I mean working - ratting mainly.  They are not that common in the UK - where the breed started because they are not for the feint hearted - a true terrier.    Saying that the little scruffy mut on my sofa at the moment looks like butter wouldnt melt!       Good luck in your search!|`|vPde97E2aa	Fell Terriers=the correct breed name=are NOT a recognized breed.  They are NOT "hard to come by" here.

That what they do in the wild!|`|lWd6fkgFaa	i'd just change the sand every day.
oGVWdnHraa	It could be a few different things, most likely it is stress, but it could also be mites, I would take him to the vets for a skin scraping just to be sure its not mites. My male rabbit has recently started loosing A LOT of fur, I took him to the vet to be checked for mites, he got an injection for mites, but hes still the same, so I think it must be stress, also because my female isnt showing any of the same symptoms.     :)|`|g9t2LQhtaa	Yeah i know why it is falling .. Coz you give the same food  what you eat to your rabbit.. .. You should stop giving food that you eat to rabbit .. Coz.. the chilli and salt will cause reaction in the animals body ( not alll animals can bare it..) and they tend to loose hair.. so better you give carrots and vegetables ( search for rabbit food in google you will find it.. Ok.. take care of it..|`|s1ePCpOeaa	YES, its normal, calm down dont stress, it must be a girl, cas the pull out their fur to make a nest, it doesent always mean theyre pregnate tho, good luck :D

AA12083992	Constipation is a symptom of an underlying problem. Were me, I would take my dog to the vet to find the problem and not just try to treat the symptom with oils and such. If there is a serious problem you could do more harm than good.  It could be something as simple as her food. I don't know what you feed her but if it's poor quality dog food and/or table scraps that could be the problem. Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available. If you want to learn more check out: http://www.sagekeep.com/petfood.htm    www.api4animals.org/facts?p=359& more=1    http://animalark.eapps.com/animal/PetFoo...|`|ORe8qdtTaa	I would be consulting a vet and asking advise on what you are feeding her - especially if you are feeding eggs a lot.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	My dogs have this happen occasionally, but only if they've eaten something odd.    Normal digested food wouldn't get stuck as you describe because there's nothing in it long enough to get stuck.    If you are feeding her a good diet (with plenty of healthy fibre), she's been wormed, and she hasn't eaten anything she shouldn't (eg stealing from the rubbish bin, or swallowing bits of toys), then it is probably worth checking things out with the vet.    Good luck with her.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I could understand this if there was a good reason for it, such as eating the stuffing from a fluffy toy and she had trouble passing the stuffing from the toy but this doesn't sound normal at all.  I would take her to the vet to make sure everything is in working order.   Egg should have been digested rather than coming out undigested.    It sounds like she is unaware that she has feces hanging out and that isn't normal.  Most dogs are distressed when this happens to them.    You may have to find a better quality food for her.  The premium grade dog foods are not sold in supermarkets.|`|oiKtuj5aaa	I would say try giving her a bit of cod liver oil or even olive oil to try and loosen up her stool a bit. And if that doesn't work, then i would consider taking her to your vet.|`|7e22a1b7de650843d2dd580cc4ddb41aaa	got to  a vet
a2cjwMKcaa	A tank never NEEDS more fish....    Yes you may be able to keep a few more, but thats your choice.    As for returning the dyed fish, thats not going to help the individual fish you have now  Better to let them live in your tank, and just vow not to buy any more.    Gourami tend to be a bit agresive, so best not to crowd too many in a tank. Keep the gourami you have and get a few more bottom dwellers to even out the tank    Ian|`|GrhiWC4uaa	well from what ive heard people tell me is that there is to be a gal or 2 gal of water required per fish..so dont over do it...i think its 2 gals for sure..those aquarium pieces may be nice to look at but they can take up a lot of space..|`|o65klEwWaa	I think you have enough in there.   Plecos can get very big (6"-25" depending on variety). I would have thought too big for a 55g tank. Gold gouramis also get very big, aggressive and may fight with the dwarfs. Gouramis like a slightly acid water, so keep that in mind if you are buying more fish. Also the schooling type fish like to be kept in large groups of at least 6. Small groups will stress them.  Treat a group of 6 small schooling fish like a large fish in terms of tank size requirements.    I know you say you like large fish, but with a tank that is small to average, you don't have a lot of choices.     As for the dyed fish, well I would take them back. I know it is cruel to the individual fish, but hopefully you will be sending a message to Walmart not to stock them. THen if enough people do this, things might change. Like you say, yours have a doomed life anyway.

XxU94aKlaa	If you had a breeder mentor that knew what he or she was doing they would be able to help you.  I would just consider it a sign honestly- Breeding just one time for friends and family really is not a good reason to breed, and the way a lot of pups end up in shelters. Everyone thinks "it won't happen to my puppies" but the majority of the time it does.    It's also very difficult for anyone to answer without knowing the dog's breed, the size of the male and female (male should always be smaller than the female, so the male being too heavy should NOT be your issue), and i'm just wondering why the heck your even attempting to breed when neither of you have the experience to know what to do when a male has issues "hitting his mark" so to speak (a very basic issue that happens quiet often, and something my mentor went over me rather close to the start).|`|gwUMipsUaa	There is no need to breed when there are thousands of dogs just like your dog in shelters awaiting execution.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Sometimes I reckon nature just doesn't want something to happen.    Don't force it.    Plenty of dogs in the world for your family to give loving homes to.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	She isn't ready, and anybody with some breeding experience would know that. It is different when breeding mongrels and breeding pure bred dogs. You didn't say which yours was.  This female if she is allowing her rear end to drop well then she isn't ready let her alone, she may not like some one watching her. If you keep forcing her she may just turn on male and snap at him.    Have her spayed and stop trying to breed her|`|AA12083992	I can not for the life of me understand why any one that likes dogs enough to have one would intentionally breed their pet. There are millions of healthy pups/dogs killed every year in shelters because their are never enough homes to go around. For every pup that is born, another dog dies in a shelter. Do you know there are fifteen dogs born for every one human? That means for every dog to have a home every human would have to own fifteen dogs. A family of four would have to own sixty dogs. Not likely to happen. Why would you want to contribute to the gross pet overpopulation problem?  Even if you find homes for all your pups, what about when those pups start having pups? Did you know that one female and her offspring can produce 67,000 dogs in either six or seven years? Are you prepared to find 67,000 homes in that amount of time? Please, for the sake of homeless dogs everywhere, reconsider breeding her. Your family could adopt pups that are already born, save a life. Those pups are dying for a home.|`|f1kRtbMAaa	Well everyone here is against breeding but I can offer some tips if you give more details,Breed of dogs being bred,size of female and male,day in her cycle you are breeding .Email me and I'll just give info from my years of experience.I know I'll get thumbs down but if someone is going to breed they might as well have some helpful advise so the dogs are handled correctly.Every breeder was a beginner at one time.Added; I hope I understood you right as you  tried with 3 different males at different heats not the same heat.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	You need  to get your female Spayed and if you have a male, get him Neutered! Leave the breeding to the professionals, who are breeding for the right reasons and who know exactly what they are doing. You don't have any experience, judging by your question and if you breed your female with a heavier or larger dog, she will have complications which you will not know how to handle and you will end up killing her, because the puppies will be too large for her to carry and whelp! Is that really a risk you are willing to take?|`|6bXii13paa	Ok, if you believe in God, This is a time to realize that God is trying to tell you something.  I understand the emotion and desire to want your dog to have puppies but please do not bring more puppies into the world when there are so many in shelters waiting for loving families.  I am not intentionally trying to so any disrespect but honestly, whoever it is that wants the puppies, please, do the "humane" thing and tell them about the puppies and adult dogs that need to be rescued.    HER EYES MET MINE AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR PEERING APPREHENSIVELY INTO THE KENNELS. I FELT HER NEED INSTANTLY AND KNEW I HAD TO HELP HER. I WAGGED MY TAIL, NOT TOO EXUBERANTLY, SO SHE WOULDN'T BE AFRAID.    AS SHE STOPPED AT MY KENNEL I BLOCKED HER VIEW FROM A LITTLE ACCIDENT I HAD IN THE BACK OF MY CAGE. I DIDN'T WANT HER TO KNOW THAT I HADN'T BEEN WALKED TODAY. SOMETIMES THE SHELTER KEEPERS GET TOO BUSY AND I DIDN'T WANT HER TO THINK POORLY OF THEM.    AS SHE READ MY KENNEL CARD I HOPED THAT SHE WOULDN'T FEEL SAD ABOUT MY PAST. I ONLY HAVE THE FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE'S LIFE. SHE GOT DOWN ON HER KNEES AND MADE LITTLE KISSY SOUNDS AT ME. I SHOVED MY SHOULDER AND SIDE OF MY HEAD UP AGAINST THE BARS TO COMFORT HER.    GENTLE FINGERTIPS CARESSED MY NECK; SHE WAS DESPERATE FOR COMPANIONSHIP. A TEAR FELL DOWN HER CHEEK AND I RAISED MY PAW TO ASSURE HER THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL.    SOON MY KENNEL DOOR OPENED AND HER SMILE WAS SO BRIGHT THAT I INSTANTLY JUMPED INTO HER ARMS. I WOULD PROMISE TO KEEP HER SAFE. I WOULD PROMISE TO ALWAYS BE BY HER SIDE. I WOULD PROMISE TO DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO SEE THAT RADIANT SMILE AND SPARKLE IN HER EYES. I WAS SO FORTUNATE THAT SHE CAME DOWN MY CORRIDOR. SO MANY MORE ARE OUT THERE WHO HAVEN'T WALKED THE CORRIDORS. SO MANY MORE TO BE SAVED. AT LEAST I COULD SAVE ONE.    I RESCUED A HUMAN TODAY.|`|ixutx59Daa	Spay your dog.

Maiden dogs often do not know what the heck is going on and will sit down.  Having experience like you claim, you should know that. Especially with small dogs. They often need assistance.   YOU need help, exposing your dog to 3 different (dare I say) unscreened or researched dogs. Brucellosis, anyone? Inbreeding unqualified individuals, anyone? Double up on deadly recessives, anyone? {SHUDDER}

Leave them alone, it's too easy to damage them.  Some apple snails deposit their eggs out of the water, other breeds deposit them in the water.  They know what they're doing.  If you don't end up with baby snails, the eggs were probably not fertilized.

luwTb77Waa	Why would you shave a dog..??|`|f1kRtbMAaa	What was the reason for shaving the dog in the first place?If only to get rid of excess hair then this would  not cause  no growth of hair coming back.If you shave a dog's hair down it should grow back unless there is a health issue..|`|9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	Yes I think you probably do need help.  Shaving an animal for no good reason is a cruel thing to do.  You try walking outside with no clothes on for a while and see if you like it!|`|gWoZYpX6aa	I think you should consider seeing your vet. There could be many problems attributing to his lack of hair growth. Mange mites and other bothersome critters could be a problem as well as a protein deficiency or food allergy.

Good luck!|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Pekingese have double coats.  NO double coated dog should ever be shaved for that very reason.  I don't know what your reason for shaving him in the first place was, (didn't want to groom him, matted, thought it would keep him cooler in the summer, shedding) but you may have ruined its coat and it may never grow back.  Only brushing and light trimming should have been done.    If you live in a colder climate, you may have to use a sweater for him in the winter months, since you shaved away his insulation.|`|3891fcebb566f7370dbbd6418e15f386aa	This is a very common problem when shaving down fur bearing (double coated) breeds.  I have seen this so many times in Peke's, Pom's, Aussies, etc...  This usually happens in older dogs that have regrown their coats in the past but for what ever reason one day it just doesn't grow back.  The reason for this is unknown but they are currently doing a study on it at the University of Michigan.  In the mean time, if the hair follicles are viable, the product I will list below may help in conjunction with some Missing Link.  You can get the ML at petsmart.  Both products are pricey but if it were me, I would give it a try.  If it works, don't shave your peke again.  Try doing a 1/2" cut instead.  It's a very nice haircut and still very manageable for the pet owner.    http://www.showdogstore.com/designinghea...    http://www.epi-pet.com/|`|52ec8b62317a3fb1bb3d18adcb288e4daa	For what reason would you ever shave a dog that is not supposed to be shaved.??????????????Oh, I bet I can guess.

0b27c16dd325e2296a8900a92d1cba9faa	I've met a show dog that's also a Seizure Alert dog. He's a keeshond named Tommy. I believe he has offspring that are also assistance dogs.     I think most breeders would be thrilled to have a puppy placed in a home where someone would be with the dog all time. And 9 weeks isn't an outrageous request. My dog's litter brother stayed at his breeders house until he was 11 weeks because his new owners were on vacation!     As a breeder, my only concern would be, what happens if the dog didn't work out? What would you do with it? If you would need to re-home the dog, make sure the breeder insists on taking the dog back!     You might want to look for boxer breeders who focus on obedience or agility work, and have their puppies temperament tested. Those breeders might have a better idea which puppy has the right type of personality to go to more of a working type home.     Also, contact the National Boxer club or a regional boxer club. They'll know of reputable breeders who would be able to work with you.|`|Chxoncy7aa	My breed is not typically used for service dogs, but I would think it was wonderful.  I have seen top breeders give champion dogs away, so they can be service dogs.  They are young finished champions.  You can only keep so many intact dogs, so when that perfect homes comes along, that is the top priority.  All breeders are not the same though.  I think most reputable, responsible breeders, that breed their dogs to improve the breed would be thrilled.  Most pet owners just want a pet.  To know someone is going to really train and work with a dog, is great for everyone.  The dogs really enjoy it, and are typically well cared for.|`|AA10412922	I would not even go so far as mentioning the service dog,first screen the breeders for those who will keep the pup with the litter past 9 weeks.Then narrow down the pups that are suitable for service work|`|f1kRtbMAaa	I'd be thrilled if someone wanted to use a puppy of mine for any type of service work.Not sure what sort of negative responses you are getting from  breeders you have contacted.Doesn't make sense.What are you asking of them?Added:If all you are asking that the pup stay until 9 weeks of age that should not be an issue.I would as most breeders would want a deposit on the pup to hold until that date.|`|vPde97E2aa	MY pups will NOT be be sold until *********AFTER************10 WEEKS!

But I remove the pups from the litter at 6 weeks...same as seeing eye dogs are done. They are allowed to leave the kennel at 8 weeks. I have them come back here for the remaining puppy shots, and advise them to stay away from dog parks and the vets office until it's time for a rabies shot. I breed working GSD's...it's not ALL about the bitework. GSD's and Labs have done more service jobs for humans than any other breeds. Separating those litters at 6 weeks has been common practice for a long time.    The only reason I can see for them "cutting you off", is that most people aren't capable of training seizure dogs...or any other service dog for that matter. So you wind up sounding like a Blowhard Dip$hit. Perhaps tell them you just want a pet...then look for a professional trainer.|`|0lcSi5tnaa	Remember most of these breeders of the common dogs are crap and want to peddle their puppies as soon as possible, continue to search do not settle someone would love to have their puppies as service animals. 9 weeks is barely a long time!

1bRRODd2aa	Unless your dog is an exceptional example of the breed and has the championship certificate to prove it - DO NOT BREED YOUR DOG.    Get it spayed NOW.    Your dog does not NEED a litter of puppies. She will be healthier and live longer if she is spayed.  Once she has a litter of pups she will be more susceptible to mammary tumors and Pyometra, both of which are usually fatal.    If you are going to be stubborn and insist on breeding your dog, then first get all its health certificates, she must be tested and certified free of Hip Dysplacia and all other genetic problems the breed can be prone to by a Vet.  Make sure that she is fully up to date for the term of her pregnancy and suckling of all her vaccinations. Then you have to wait until she is at least 2 years old.  Then you need to find the best specimen of male that you can find as a stud that has also been tested free of those genetic diseases.      Wait until your dog is into the second week of her heat and then introduce the dogs.  Use an experienced stud dog for her first mating.    Prepare for the pregnancy, birth and care of the pups.

Better yet, please, please get her spayed.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	The first sign to l ook for is the swelling of the rear end and also some fenales do have PMT in other words they have clinging to you and odd behaviour problems.As soon as you see blood although it starts very light then she is in season or in heat.If you wish to breed her depending on what breed you  never breed before 18 months of age if it is a registered dog.A one year old is the equilevent of a 7 yr old in  human terns of course they shoudl not be bred yet.Have you ever had a litter before l doubt it as if you cannot tell when your female is in heat you have an awful lot to learn.it is hard hard work the female doesNOT do everything and you could be up for expensive vet bills if it needs an ultra sound or a C section.That is your choice but before she comes in heat again which is usuually every 6 months learn as much as you can about having a litter,raisinga litter and when and how to mate your female.Sometimes they need help and you are not qualified for this so you need what is called a studmaster or someone to help  you mate the female with assistance who knows what they ae doing.Do you know a C- section can cost up to $2000 and vet bills if you hit troubl will cost you dearly and lastly if you have not a registered pure breed why breed with any german shepherd  you want the best for her and that costs money for a stud fee so consider this as well.Anyone who breeds dogs knows there is no money in it and you may find that out after your vet bills feed bils and puppy rearing food bills if you do the right thing.What are you going to do if you have a stuck pup or in a breach position,you will not know and you will not have time to ask h ere on this site and that is another vet bill and after hours it is double.research as much as you can and  decide whether it is worth it.Up to you l will not tell you what to do its not my place to do  so.l dp not dit in judgement|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Dogs don't get "periods"  If you don't know THAT...you shouldn't be breeding her    Do yourself a favor.

Why are you trying to breed her so young this is like a 12 year old having a baby.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	1. You should not breed her at one year of age. She is too young!   2.  If you have to ask questions like this on a forum and if you do not even know the proper terminology, you should not breed her.    Responsible breeding is not something to take lightly.    1. The motto of the responsible breeder of purebred dogs is "Breed to Improve."     Every dog is the best dog in the world to its owner. Responsible breeders, however, know to avoid "kennel blindness" -- in other words, they take a step back and honestly evaluate the good and bad points of their dogs before making the decision to breed. The goal of breeding, after all, is to produce a better dog and a quality pet.     2. Raising puppies is a full-time job. During the first couple of weeks the dam normally takes care of the puppies' needs, but complications, such as a dam with no milk or an orphaned litter, may arise. It is the breeder's responsibility to provide a safe, warm, dry place for the puppies and proper food and water for the *****.     Puppies are even more work (and more fun!) when they are weaned. The extra feeding, cleanup, grooming, training, and veterinary care adds up to a lot of hours - and not much free time for you.    Another factor that you must consider is the financial cost of having a litter of puppies. From the genetic screening and health tests before breeding to the extra food, supplies, and medical care required after the puppies are born, the cost of whelping and raising puppies can be very high, especially if complications arise.    3.  Good puppies start long before breeding ever takes place. Both parents need long-term care - what dog people call conditioning - to produce the best offspring. This means regular veterinary care, screening for genetic problems, pre-breeding tests, and regular exercise and good nutrition. Bitches should not be overweight and should have good muscle tone before breeding. Additionally, a ***** that is in good mental condition will make a better mother than a ***** that is insecure, snappy, or has an otherwise unstable temperament.     4.  To be an effective breeder, you should have a basic understanding of the science of genetics. Everything about your prospective puppies health, soundness, looks, and temperament will be determined by the genes passed on by their parents, and by their parents before them. Therefore, the selection of a mating pair should not be made solely on the basis of the dog's or *****'s looks (or temperament or soundness, etc.), but should be based on an understanding of how the animal's genes contributed to its looks and of how those genes are passed on and expressed. That is why it is essential to study the pedigrees of your mating pair. The more knowledge you have as you make your selection, the more likely you are to produce a litter with the qualities you desire.     You should also be well-versed in the genetic problems that affect your breed. Genetic defects can occur in any breed and can affect any system in the body. Some genetic diseases may occur in many breeds; others occur in only one or a few breeds. The following is a brief explanation of how genetic defects may be inherited and expressed.    And that's just the start:  http://www.akc.org/breeders/resources/gu...    You are no where near ready to become a breeder.  Show your b*tch to see if she's breeding quality.  Get yourself a breed mentor.  And study the breed standard as well as learn correct terminology before you even think of breeding.  The last thing GSDs need is an irresponsible backyard breeder.|`|W9pm19Ttaa	Sexually mature female dogs (female dogs that have not been surgically spayed) are said to be in estrus, or "in heat", or "in season", during their occasional heat "cycle" which can happen once or more yearly.    If your female dog is in heat or about to be, be forewarned that generally most females have their first heat cycle at around 6 to 12 months of age.    Sometimes females of the larger dog breeds may not have their first seasonal estrus cycle until they are 12 months of age or older. A female  should never be breed on her first heat and not on her second heat either since she has immature eggs. The rule of the thumb is to begin breeding on the third season or around 1.5 to 2 years old with all health tests satisfactorily passed. Your  female should be examined by a veterinarian to be assured she is free and clear of hip displays, cataracts, cherry eye, palate problems, heart conditions and other congenital diseases.|`|l5kWF8m3aa	Get your dogs spayed.

iJtuhLMTaa	I assume you are referring to the dyed blood parrots which is the most common use of the name and not the blood/convert cichlid hybrid which also uses this name.    The process of dying the fish the make them the various colors greatly weakens the fish making them much more susceptible to disease and more likely to die from disease other fish can fight off.      Did the white spots look like someone had put salt on the fish or did they look more like cotton.  If they look like salt it is ich and the whole tank needs to be treated with  ich medication.  If it looks like cotton it is a fungal infection and the tank needs to be treated with an anti-fungal.       If you have the dyed blood parrots please in the future don't buy fish that have been dyed.  It greatly reduces the live span of the fish and is a cruel process that should not be supported by purchasing the dyed fish or supporting any pet store that sales them.|`|q5m9g1yWaa	are they fish, parrots, or jellybeans?!

tDyViGH7aa	When combining cages, there are a lot of things to consider.  Gender doesn't always equal success or failure.  Birds are actually a lot like people in the sense that they have variable personalities.  Just as you might be friends with a girl or boy, birds will too.  Also, just as you might really like someone one day, and really *not* like them the next, birds will do that too.    The other problem you run into is if the cage has belonged to one bird first, that bird will likely be very territorial.  If you put another bird in (male OR female) that bird may not be too happy, and may put up a fight, harming the other bird, or becoming harmed himself.  Most people I know with multiple birds (myself included) have separate cages for each bird.  This is a safety precaution, and a comfort issue for the birds.  Birds like the security of having a place of their own.    Definitely introduce the birds to each other, let them get to know each other in "neutral" territory.  A room they've never been in, with no windows, plenty of space, and no mirrors (basically no distractions).  I've taken my birds into the bathroom, and covered the mirror with a sheet.  Put them opposite each other (give them plenty of space!!!) and let them "have a conversation".  This will likely look like fighting, at least a little.  They will probably lock beaks, and yell at each other.  They're establishing dominance.  If they begin to scratch at each other or bite harmfully in other areas of the body, you need to separate them.  They might well bite you hard in the process.  But it will give them a chance to establish a "pecking order" so to speak.  I know this sounds violent, or cruel, but I promise you this is a natural occurrence in flocks.  I have a friend who has a large aviary (upwards of 10-20 different birds) with many different species.  They're all great friends, and very much considered a flock.  These birds have been together for years, and they still "have conversations" like this every once in a while.  It helps maintain dominance, and pecking order.    If this makes you worried or uncomfortable, just keep them in separate cages.  That is totally fine!  Give them their out of cage time separately.  Then, you won't have to worry about them interacting in a way that could cause harm.    Again, the best cage to put two birds into (as long as the birds are already friendly with each other!) is one that neither of them has lived in or seen before.  That way there are no territorial issues already present.  The cage needs to be sufficiently sized for two birds.  For example, a cage just big enough for one Quaker, is not big enough for two.  In a cramped space, they will fight.  If you do decide to cage them together, keep an eye on them.  Even if they've been caged together for a year, they may still have a serious disagreement, and a rather big fight.  We had a pair of Cockatiels who had been living together at the store I work at for almost a year, and out of nowhere began to fight.  These were a male and female pair, and they just stopped getting along.  We separated them, and they were fine.  So, always, keep an eye on the birds.  Give them plenty of toys, make sure they both get a chance to eat and one isn't hoarding all the food.  Make sure they get out of cage time, and interaction with you.  Keep in mind, if they bond to each other, they might be less likely to bond with you and step-up on command etc.  Keep working with them both on stepping up onto your hand, and going into their cage when asked.    Good luck with whatever you decide to do!|`|x5HMQgQyaa	Sure, you can physically stuff them in the same cage, but as to whether you should? That's a much harder question.    Do you have one bird already, and are buying a second bird? If so, I would not recommend housing them together at the start. Cage them separately for a while (after the initial 30 day quarantine period) and make sure they are getting along well after several trials of supervised interaction.    If they have been housed together already, such as at the pet store or from their previous home, then it should be fine.    Remember to get a DNA test done, though. Just 'thinking' they are male is not good enough. Quakers are not sexually dimorphic and the only way to determine gender is by DNA, or sugical, sexing.
C1eHfhrHaa	Well, since you brought the dog home, you are responsible for it.  Take it to the vet and have it checked out.  Sometimes being in a new place will put dogs off their food, but all new animals in your house should be vet checked within 72 hours of bringing them home, especially if you already have other dogs.|`|AA12128656	the dog needs to see a vet.   you can care for him without your parent's help, but you'll need to let him out between school and work    the dog definitely needs a visit to the vet's office though. he may have a blockage or illness that's causing his inability to make a bowel movement, and you can't let him go on like that. it could also be causing his skinniness, or he might just have worms.    i think it's a good idea to try to find someone who will care for him, but in the mean time, get him to a vet and care for him the best you can.  it's better than being PTS. that's just my opinion...|`|W0buucLsaa	You have to get this dog to the vet on your next day off. The no-eating thing is less worrisome than the not-being-able-to-go-to-the-bathroom thing - is it number 1 or number 2? If it were number 1 that he can't do, I'd be REALLY concerned. That is very weird; the dog could have a serious problem.     If it's number 2, he may have some sort of intestinal blockage or something that makes him unable to eat, too.     I'm sorry that your parents are being jerks about it. You're a good person for going out on a limb for a shelter dog.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	At no time did you say you had even considered taking the dog to the vet.   Call the shelter and see what the vet had said when it was examined and what you should do next. Basically the dog needs a VET but they might help with the cost since it was a preexisting problem|`|AA11352641	This dog needs to see a vet.|`|72GOhb9eaa	Take him to a vet!|`|3p6wp7DYaa	You should always take a new dog who was just rescued from a pound to your vet asap. He could have a variety of parasites that could infect your other dogs, he could have some sort of a blockage that will not allow him to go to the bathroom, or some other type of illness.    Stop feeding him and just give him small amounts of water until you can have him checked out. Do it today if possible, and make sure to tell the  vet everything you described in your question.    Good luck!|`|ZLFgVHreaa	At least he's eating something. However, he shouldn't just eat canned food, since it contains barely any nutrients. The hard dog food contains a lot of nutrients, that canned food for dogs should only be used as a topper.     He probably doesn't like the hardness of the dog food, so try softening up his dog food. A good idea is mixing hot water and the hard dog food until its soft, then drain the water. After that, mix the canned food with the dog food. Also, try warming up the canned food as well before mixing up the dog food.|`|JMOLRKRraa	He sounds sick. Intestinal problems maybe. Unless he is in pain, and can't eat. Is he whimpering? Maybe he has to get used to eating food again and his intestines need to get processing again. You really shouldn't take a dog unless you can give it 10 years time.|`|duemKP0Aaa	get your mom or dad to feed it when you go to school|`|n8Ru0aUhaa	Hi,    I adopted a dog in a similar way, and he was protein deficient, anemic, a whole rigamaroo (sp?) of things..    What I did was buy a giant tub of cottage cheese, and another of plain yogurt. I mixed a few table spoons of cottage cheese, yogurt and hot water into his dry food.    That will bulk up his protein, which will help him get up, and not collapse. You should take him to the vet, of course, but in the meantime, get his energy up with the proteins.    FINISH the tubs, do not stop giving him the cottage cheese and yogurt until it is all gone. Do this in small portions with the dry food (puppy food would be ideal, as it contains more nutrients that he is probably lacking), every day, three or four times a day.    Do NOT feed him pies and sausage.. whoever said that is a moron.  When he is feeling better and putting on a little weight, you should bring him to the vet to get checked out. There could be an underlying issue that caused all this in the first place. But let's get him strong enough to handle the trip, first.    Good luck.|`|sJy8zGNhaa	you absolutely need to take that dog to a vet, if he wont eat anything but soft foods, then he may have infected teeth. i had a cat who almost died because of infected teeth, similar symptoms (malnourishment from not being able to eat causes weakness) antibiotics are probably needed. if you tell them you adopted this doggy they might even work with you on the bill.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	call your vet and explain the situation and see what advice they give as they may prescribe something to build him up and make him better|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	You need to find a way to get the poor dog to the vet's ASAP.  It's great that you rescued a dog, but really you should have thought about expenses before you adopted.  I'm really surprised that the rescue adopted out a dog to a minor.|`|vHG4raMhaa	put him out of his misery. Or just feed him idk whatever is easier
Kntsw4Hdaa	I've noticed that when I whistle or whisper my cats meow and let me know they don't like it.  They also react that way when I sing loudly.  Cats do have sensitive ears and sounds of certain frequencies, pitches can be irritating to their ears.  Try not to avoid activities that seem to annoy your kitty.  If you have any other concerns, contact your vet.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	cats like dogs have sensitive hearing... it is possible that when you blew there was a high pitched whiseling noise that only the cat can here ... this would make the cat crazy...|`|UkhAYJxhaa	they like to play. i do it to my cats all the time. they love it.|`|IuYekkPVaa	I've noticed that huffing or puffing seems to provoke an aggressive reaction in some cats.  Perhaps because hissing is also a breathy sound, it's considered a threat or challenge?    This excerpt is from the Messybeast article on cat communication;    "In his dealings with Scottish Wildcats, Mike Tomkies noted that the wildcats would greet him with a loud spitting "PAAAH" accompanied by a foot-stamp. I have received the same greeting from feral cats. The meaning ("*** off!") is unmistakable and only a fool (or a cat-worker intent on packing a cat off for neutering) ignores it".    http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk.htm
034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I am a bigger woman and get looked down upon all the time for my size.  I'm 5'6" and about 250, but my horse is 16hh and about 1200.  His conformation is good, and even though he is just getting started, I know I can ride circles around some riders who are smaller than I am (my friend is one of those people who is about my height and maybe weighs 110 soaking wet) but she'll admit that I'm a better rider than she is.  I've always been bigger than the other girls around me so I don't really know anything else.      I am out of shape because I had back surgery and have to be careful about the kinds of exercise I do.  Riding is the one thing that gets me back into shape and keeps me in shape.  I'm always in terrible pain after a hard ride, but it's well worth it for me.      Take a look at the Arabians that Wayne Newton rides.  He's a pretty big guy, but rides smaller horses.  Granted Arabians are generally more capable of carrying more because of their shorter backs, but still.      I look better on my bigger horse because I'm bigger, we fit well.  We still get looked down upon when someone sees me riding, but I take every precaution to make sure I'm not overstressing my gelding.  He's a good solid youngster and I go slowly with him, but that does not mean I can't ride him because of my weight.    The really fun thing is trying to find show clothes that don't cost a fortune but still fit well, and saddles with big enough seats that don't rub my horse the wrong way.|`|YtBzRAxMaa	I think it's a matter of your ability to maintain strength and balance.   Being "out of shape" does not refer only to the large.   I can't stand the "frail and delicate lil flowers" that want to ride a 6 yr old 17hh horse that they keep in a stall 6 days a week so it won't get dirty...   No trainer can make that horse safe for that person. Ugh. This type also does not groom...they flick at the horse with a dandy and then whine.   Riding a horse is only as much excersise as you want it to be. Grooming and mucking helps build the muscle required to ride. An active lifestyle helps.   That said - a person shaped like a beach ball simply cannot ride a horse.|`|Jl7aaaTEaa	OK, a few years back I was a fit and healthy 11 stone (or thereabouts).  4 years on I now weigh around 13.5 stone.  What happened?  Well, I have 3 kids aged 3, 1 1/2 and 10 weeks and for the obvious reasons I have not dsone a lot of riding over the past 4 years.  All this is about to change, yes, I am overweight, my bust has gone from a B to an E and I have gone up several dress sizes but I am certainly not unfit, in the last 2 weeks alone I have done a lot of physical building work on my land, so far 3 new stables, fenced a new paddock, began a sand school etc and I am about ready to start back riding too.    Providing the horse can carry the weight of the rider and the rider can control the horse then there is no reason why a person of 'larger build' should not ride.    To those skinny waifs in the hipster jods that say the bigger framed riders should stop..... Get a life, it's not a fashion parade, it's a sport, and like horses, people come in all shapes and sizes too.  Don't judge til you know the facts!    Oops, Sorry, went on a bit of a rant there but think I hit the point :P|`|GfC98fstaa	No, it DOES NOT matter. Just because some jerk with his nose in the air thinks he can say that it very immature and rude. Of course, you can't be too big to ride a horse (like 300 or 400 pounds), but you don't have to be sticks and bones either.    Horseback riding IS a sport, and it gives you a good workout. But, just tell people to get off their back about riding horses. If it's your hobbie, then do it. You have the right to ride horses. No one can tell you otherwise.|`|iFz17TCIaa	I believe it's all in the way one carries themselves and the picture they present when mounted.  It's in the equitation.      If riding correctly, you actually use more muscle groups together than going to the gym and working on 10 different machines.  Plus you're not in some stinky enclosed room with a     If your legs are proper, it works  the muscles, if you have the proper balance and posture, your core is worked.  I've seen heavyset people that just bounce around and don't concentrate on proper body position.  I've seen the opposite too.  The same goes with thin people.  they can be like a long stringbean or have the proper seat and look great.  it can go both ways.  It's all in having good equitation and showing that confidence that says "I'm a rider and take my riding seriously".  It's all in the "attitude" exuded...for all body types.    Also, dressing properly and having properly fitted attire for whatever the discipline also helps to create a prettier picture and a certain confidence and look no matter what the body type.  Not only on show days, but schooling days as well.    As far as people saying that people are hurting themselves and their horses because of having a bigger frame is not right but, are they saying it to be mean or is there perhaps some truth to it because of the way they ride and the presentation they make.  In that case, perhaps having someone take a video  of them riding might be in order.  I have all my lessons taped to critique and see what I really look like and need to work on.  It's a great tool!!    Anyway, DON'T stop riding..if anything, ride more and work your muscles!!!    EDIT~~  I also agree what was said below in that being matched with a conformationally correct horse for the body type also helps to make a proper picture.  Big or small!!!|`|BOKLXbhKaa	No... a horse would rather carry a heavy balanced rider than an unbalanced light one... it's like would you rather carry 10 pounds of bags in one hand, or 10 pounds of bags in both hands so you're balanced? I wouldn't let anyone tell you that you're too fat to ride (unless your weight is so much that it is a hazard, which I doubt it is).|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I understand what the trainer is saying and I agree.  To be able to hold your body responsibly and have good control and balance over yourself  which intern will affect your horses performance does matter.  Now if you are just riding for pleasure and not asking your horse to perform a reining pattern or go over jumps for example then riding is a good way to get in shape.  But when it comes to more strenuous riding on say a performance horse you do need to be in shape much like an athlete just like you expect your horse to also be in tip top shape and an athlete.      Here is were I am at. I am currently working on loosing weight do to recently having my third child.  So I have been working horses and doing the farm work in order to get back in shape.  But I am not going to deny that having extra weight on me and lacking some muscle tone is like night and day in my ability to perform to my top potential.  It is alot harder to sit a green horse and stay balanced to take what ever they may through your way when you are out of shape.  I can't wait to get back into tip top shape because it makes things alot easier.  So yes it does matter and if you are serious about riding like any other sport you should strive to be in great shape.  After all we expect that of our horses as well.    Jenny|`|FWlSFpByaa	ABSOLUTLEY NOT!!!!!!!!! just because one top trainer that thinks they know everything says one thing about weight does not mean you have to change yourself! Your horse doesn't love you because of your weight, he loves you because your you!!! Im built with a taller with broad shoulders and long legs but im not obese, and neither are you, But i don't let people get away with people telling me that i can't do things or that i shouldn't. I just turn and laugh and say "thanks for the tip" and walk away. Gets em everytime. SO DON"T CHANGE for anyone! love yourself for yourself!|`|hEXb1unraa	Shawn Flarida is pushing 230 or heavier and rides small little reining horses....I think what matters most is your ability to be a balanced rider to be a help to your horse not be a hindrance. I know bigger riders that can ride circles around so called ( tiny, skinny people )|`|02l7vkALaa	I think it is really silly of anyone to criticize someone for being out of shape and riding. That is ridiculous. I've never really heard anyone say anything like that, but I live in the middle of nowhere and don't get out much LOL.      Like you said, as long as someone does not weigh more than their horse can comfortably carry, what's the problem? Any person with a poor fitting saddle, or really poor riding posture can really hurt a horse. But as long as a person is within the weight that their horse can carry, and they ride correctly, there shouldn't be anything anyone can say?     My aunt is a REALLY big gal, and always has been. But that lady taught me about half of what I know about horses, and can outride me any day of the week at the age of 56! She is really a excellent horsewoman. She only rides for pleasure, but she does it well.     Not to mention that the simple act of horsekeeping is HARD work as we all know! I don't know many little dainty girls who could handle a full days work on a farm.     Now, I do believe that getting into shape can be beneficial if you are really working to improve your riding skills and advance in a discipline, but it isn't necessary to ride and ride well.     I think the only way to settle this is to have a ride off! Skinnies VS. us "healthy" gals! First one around the Oak tree and back wins! YeeHaw!|`|QpElKY8Kaa	I never saw anything that requires riders to be anorexic or bulimic (or just look like it) Thank God!    There was a guy at our barn that looked completely out of shape.  On the ground.  On a horse, all that was said was how he 'could sit a horse.'  Remarkable transformation.    Someone svelte can flop around on a horse and be unbearable to watch, all sympathy to the horse.   Then there are those who need to shape up but know how to sit a horse i.e. know how to ride. (and need to)    Years back I was helping a friend train two of her horses for endurance.   The area we trained in was laid out in a grid.  N - S was intersected at half mile intervals E - W. all dirt roads.    She and I shared a trait.    It wasn't long before we had an entourage of boys on bicycles "training" with us.  Has anyone ever considered duct tape as riding equipment?    My personal belief is, you don't have to be ripped to ride.  If that's a requirement, there's a bunch of us ought to be turning in our saddles.    Ride on!
