Then you need a 2-to-1 RF switch from Radioshack (about $5-$10), in one input you connect your RF output of the cable box and in the the other you connect the xbox through the RF modulator. (The cable box does not an RF modulator).|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	If it is a bypass type, it needs to go between the cable box and TV.

XFQQ0ZtXaa	You can't with Oblivion, or any game for that matter. It's physically impossible.    Game saves are not designed to be Cross-System, as a video game has to be compiled differently for each system it's ported to, thus making each version if a game completely different on each system.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	u cant because the pc save data and ps3 save data r entirley different dude|`|EfejPjIMaa	I assume you mean you downloaded a PS3 save from the internet onto your PC, and are now trying to transfer it to your PS3.  If the PS3 cannot read it, then either the file is corrupt, or there are some misspellings.      This is what I would do.  Let's assume you are using a USB flash drive (fd from here on out) to transfer the file.  Clear everything off the fd.  Put the fd in the PS3 and copy one of your existing saves already on the PS3 to the fd.  Then put the fd in the PC.  Now transfer the save from the PC to the fd, and delete your original one you transferred from the PS3.  Now put the fd back into the PS3 and see if it can recognize it.      If it still can't recognize it, then the file is either corrupt, or named wrong.  The file from the PC should have a similar name as the one transferred from the PS3.  If it doesn't, then it is named wrong, and that is why the PS3 can't see it.

ZQeXKdrAaa	Try Koss KSC-75s.  They aren't earbuds, they go over the ear and clip onto it.  To see what I mean, look at the photos in the link.  They're commonly considered probably the best bang for your buck in the audio world.      http://www.jr.com/koss/pe/KOS_KSC75/    If you're used to iPod earbuds, these will blow you away.    Also, in case you see some other reviews, do not touch Skullcandies.  They're heavily marketed but they don't have the quality to justify the price you pay.  Here is an example of how audio lovers respond to Skullcandy:    http://www.head-fi.org/forums/f11/skullc...    People here tend to recommend them, partially because they haven't heard real 'phones and compare them to the cheap included headphones they've tried, that's why I bring this up.|`|C8TkypCNaa	How bout the Marshmallow ear buds?

AA11196117	The psp system is far from capable to handle something like an operating system.  If you are wanting general tools or just the look, then look for homebrew applications and themes.  The plain answer for your question is NO, mainly because no memory stick you buy is big enough.  Also the processor and many other components, while fast are not capable of doing everything that a computer can.  Its not a downside to the PsP, look how much smaller it is than your computer.|`|PjhrL6PMaa	psp can't handle real xp, so you can get the port that looks like it.

AA10492776	HD broadcasts use a compression algorithm (MPEG) to help reduce the need for bandwidth. This algorithm works off the principle that very little changes from one frame to the next. Instead of sending the entire image every frame, this algorithm sends primarily the changes that occur between frames. With fast motion scenes, more change can occur from frame to frame than the fixed bandwidth assigned by carriers can handle. When this happens, pixelization can occur due to network bandwidth limits. The pixelization you are experiencing is very likely due to the bandwidth limits of the Time Warner network and the natural response of the MPEG compression algorithm to these limits.      Check to see if other TVs experience this same pixelization on the same fast motion scenes. This will be a clear indication that the pixelization is network based, not due to your plasma TV. Plasma TVs have the fastest and smoothest motion of the current flat screen technologies and is an unlikely source for this pixelization.|`|5009f311a98149b8d3af6bbdd5543e9aaa	The refresh time of the plasma is bad, I'm very surprised cause Panasonic makes excellent plasma panels.

In the electronics it is essential to look for after sales service, warranty and such other things along with the price, features and of course looks.

b8b8644ebe50d7ec7090f621029e793baa	A urna eletr?nica  uma inven??o da justi?a eleitoral brasileira. Ela  mais rpida, moderna e eficaz, mas ainda apresenta falhas.     verdade que a urna eletr?nica evita a maioria das fraudes, principalmente aquelas amadorsticas, feitas com papel e caneta. Contudo, a pretexto de diminuir custos e evitar questionamentos judiciais, foram desprezados procedimentos de garantia dos direitos do eleitor, deixando abertas brechas para novos tipos de fraude.    As falhas que vm sendo apontadas pelos especialistas que estudam a urna eletr?nica s?o basicamente trs: 1) falta de comprova??o fsica do voto, para que se possa ter certeza de que o voto exibido para o eleitor  o mesmo gravado na memria da mquina; 2) impossibilidade de auditoria dos programas da urna eletr?nica, pois o TSE, desrespeitando a Lei 9.504, se nega a apresentar alguns dos programas; 3) possibilidade de viola??o sistemtica dos votos, devido  digita??o do ttulo do eleitor antes de liberar a urna para a vota??o.    Se bem que, prefiro este modo do que o antigo. A contagem dos votos  bem mais clara. No sistema antigo, era fcil fraudar a contagem manual!|`|cce340755bdeb95404883fe2ed1560b7aa	 facil, falar para a 1a pessoa de cada urna desconectar um cabo de modem, falar para as outras fingirem que votem para ninguem perceber.

AA11755069	U need to activate GPRS or WAP or any such services (along with MMS service) that give u access to internet services on ur mobile phone. MMS generally uses GPRS to send & receive data. Also check the settings regarding them or request ur service provider to send the settings.|`|8bcce0fa931080001d53cecaff3809fdaa	in order to send a MMS(picture message) you must have internet service on your cell phone as well.... just need to call and ask the service provider to add it.... also you may want to check the settings in your phone.... depending on the make and model of the phone there is going to be some sort of "internet available" icon in the top of your screen, on the main page.   if the logo is not there... then you eitehr do not have the service, or a setting in your phone is incorrect.|`|AA10964343	Both users "tan... & blu..." are WRONG!!! Not all service providers have the internet logo on the phone. T-Mobile's phones only show internet indication when you are using the net. Sometimes you need to get your MMS service activated or you may need to update the settings. Call your service provider or visit the site below...

Se sono immagini che ricevi via mms forse dovresti prima salvarle nel telefonino e poi le richiami quando stai scrivendo l'mms (inserisi immagine sar senz'altro scritto da qualche parte).

Un consiglio? prova a chiamare il tuo gestore di telefonia per vedere se non c' un problema che dipende dalla rete...    Ciao

I hate verizon personally, and I think they are ridiculous with some of thier charges. My dad's company pays for my phone luckily, but our bill is never the same, Verizon always finds a way to get any little cent they can out of us.    The best plan cost wise I think is the cingular roll over, it's what my mom ended up getting.

In a bid to close the gap on Apple and its iTunes music store, Napster is giving away an MP3 player of 30 to all new subscribers to its song-download service.      Napster is offering the 512 MB version of a Sandisk music player, capable of storing about 240 songs. Customers will have to take out a three-month subscription to Napster to Go, which costs 14.95 a month.

AA11549416	You don't mention if this is an iPod, if not ignore the iTunes portion of the instructions below and use your computer's file manager or the specific software for your MP3 in place of the iTunes software.  The instructions work for most MP3 players, you just have to replace iTunes with the software provided by your MP3 manufacturer.    1) If the video is not MP4 format (e.g. a DVD movie you own), then you will need to convert the video.   There are a couple of choices for conversion, some work better than others and some have a license cost.       Here are 2 choices you can pick from:  Freeware:    Videora is my first choice because it is free, however it is more difficult to use and sometimes buggy on selected DVDs.  I'd try this one and if it doesn't work out for you then buy a more reliable solution.    Videora.com provides step-by-step instructions, follow them carefully:  http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/g...    Shareware (trial and buy $46):  http://www.dvd-ripper-copy.com/download/...    Nice thing about pay-to-use software is it has live support and an excellent support forum:  http://www.dvd-ripper-copy.com/other/sup...    (SKIP TO THIS STEP IF YOUR VIDEO IS ALREADY IN A MP4 FORMAT)  2) After ripping the DVD or video into a MP4 format, then you will need to import into iTunes.   If you don't have iTunes, you can download a free version iTunes 7 onto your computer.    Import the converted MP4 files (try to remember where you ripping software placed the files) into the iTunes library.   FILE-->IMPORT    3)Finally connect your iPod or MP3 player to the computer with the iTunes software running.   If the iPod update doesn't run automatically, you can manually start it by FILE--->UPDATE iPOD.   After the update you should be able to find your video in the menu as VIDEO-->MOVIES.   The properties in the iTunes library does control where the file lands in the MP3 player's menu, so be careful if you decide the change the file settings.    Disconnect your iPod or MP3 player and enjoy your video.

AA11549416	Need more details, this answer is different depending on if you have a Mac vs. PC.   Perhaps the easiest way is to take all the files from the PC used to load your iPod and use them to load your new iPod.   I'm guessing you don't have all the files on your old iPod in iTunes anymore so you need to export them.   You can go into the file/directory mode in iTunes and move them (option off iPod iTunes music menu).   There are several shareware utilities that will also export everything from your iPod.   Just Web search on "iPod Export".

AA11549416	I'd start with checking to see if your device is recognized.   Probably need more details, but since you mentioned firewire I'd guess you have an Apple computer although firewire is also supported on MS Windows.   The process differs for checking the device.  In Windows, a new storage device (like an iPod) will show up as a new drive.   Apple computer show show a new drive as well within seconds of connecting the device.   If the device doesn't show up, then it may be a driver issue not iTunes or iPod issue.    Work with someone who can help you update or fix the driver.     Connection problem would be the next place to check.   Standard cable that came with the iPod is USB not Firewire.   You mention Firewire, does that mean you are bought separately a Firewire cable for connection to the iPod?  If your cable is USB, it is very rectanglar port; unlike Firewire which is smaller and has two slightly rounded corners.    Having you computer look at the right port is key to the connection.    Let's say it is not a driver issue or connection problem, then check iTunes after you connect the iPod.   If iTunes recognizes the iPod the left navigation bar will add a option for updates to your iPod or viewing of the directory.  If that option shows, try to manually download updates.       If none of those work, on the top menu bar in iTunes click on "Edit" then "Preferences".    If the dialog box says "No iPod connected" that indicates and issue with your connection or driver (previously mentioned).  If it recognizes the iPod you will have an option for view as directory which will let you move files manually using file folders (one on the computer to one for the iPod).       All else fails, find someone with technical knowledge or take it to the Apple store and wait for a technician to look at it.

You need to assess the tariff as a whole and look at how many mins and txts you will probably use. Cheap line rental means you won't get much for free! So you want the call charges and txts to be cheap as well. Also make sure you consider coverage and what networks your family and friends are on.

AA11549416	Two very difficult and unique formats to try to convert.   Only way that comes to mind is a DVD-A player to regular DVD recorder using the connection cables.   Then use the re-recorded standard format media in the Videra conversion program below.      Only the standard CD layer of hybrid SACDs can be read by a PC.    DVD-A uses a different copy protection scheme. I believe it's called CPPM, and from what I've heard, it's a LOT tougher than CSS.
AA11549416	Without knowing the specific software and process you used to download, it could be many possible issues.    Sound will work with any video imported into iTunes/iPod if converted correctly.   For example, Videora.com provides step-by-step instructions that includes how to handle the audio conversion of videos.  The tricky part in converting videos is to know that audio is sometimes on multiple tracks and how to pick the right 2-channel standard audio that is best for your iPod.   Avoid picking up tracks for bonus features (e.g. commentary from actors).

AA11549416	It will take some conversion, however there is a way to project your slides.   Only software required is the PowerPoint and iTunes, however you will need to buy an accessory cable or dock for your iPod:    1)  In the PowerPoint software, you will have to save each slide as a .jpg   FILE-->SAVE AS  2)  In iTunes 7, summary screen after plugging in your iPod:  Photo tab choose the correct folder to Sync pictures converted from the PowerPoint  3)  You will need either the iPod A/V cable accessory or the iPod Dock to connect the iPod to a projector (see link below with diagrams)  4)  Using the picture viewer in iPod to display the slides    You can even use the iPod slideshow settings to automatically change slides on a time interval.    Cons:  Don't expect the same resolution as your PC connected to the projector.   See Learning Source link below for other potential issues.
AA11549416	I suspect I know what is happening, however not sure I know exactly how you are attempting to download the movie trailers.    Let me make an assumption and go from there, you can always resubmit with more details if I'm wrong.     Step 1)   You visit iTunes.com (the Web page)  Step 2)   You find the Web page with the movie trailers and click on a link to download them into your iPod  Step 3)  At this point, the Web link should start up your iTunes 7 software however instead a dialog box with "Open" pops up  Step 4)  The "Open" brings up MS Notepad    If this is the case, then your File Type settings for iTunes are probably not correct.   If you go into Windows Explorer, then click on TOOLS---->FOLDER OPTIONS----->then select the File Types tab.   A list of file types will appear shortly.   The settings you need to check are as follows:      Extension..........File Type.................................Ope... with . . . .   -------------...........------------.....  ITMS.............iTunes Music Store URL...........iTunes  ITL................iTunes Music Database file......iTunes  ITPC............Podcast Subscription File..........iTunes  PCAST........Podcast Subscription File..........iTunes    If not, then reinstall iTunes 7, but  be sure you have admin level rights for the install process.    Anytime you click on a Web link (or file in Windows Explorer) and it brings up a different software/process than you expected it is almost always related to the File Type settings under Folder Options in MS Windows.   These instructions are for Windows XP, so if you have something else look for a similar type problem and fix.   You can control what program/software opens by changing the File Types manually within Folder Options in File Explorer.

AA11549416	There are so many possibilities, although at least you know it is in the VCR/DVD recorder:    If you switched from an attenna to cable, be sure your VCR/DVD settings recognize the change in signal.  This is usually buried deep in your recorder menu system.   Often they tune differently based on the type of signal.   Check other settings in your VCR menu system as well, some other settings may be specific to the type of source (e.g. cable vs. attenna)    Does it matter if the recorder is powered on or off?  Maybe short circuiting your signal.  I'm guessing when you have tried playing a tape/DVD to make sure you can receive a clear signal from the recorder to the TV.
AA11549416	1) iTunes 7 can now find the album art for you, just right click on the song in iTunes and select Get Album Art    2)  A couple of method are available to convert DVDs to iPod videos:    ======================================...      1) If the video is not MP4 format (e.g. a DVD movie you own), then you will need to convert the video.   There are a couple of choices for conversion, some work better than others and some have a license cost.       Here are 2 choices you can pick from:  Freeware:    Videora is my first choice because it is free, however it is more difficult to use and sometimes buggy on selected DVDs.  I'd try this one and if it doesn't work out for you then buy a more reliable solution.    Videora.com provides step-by-step instructions, follow them carefully:  http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/g...    Shareware (trial and buy $46):  http://www.dvd-ripper-copy.com/download/...    Nice thing about pay-to-use software is it has live support and an excellent support forum:  http://www.dvd-ripper-copy.com/other/sup...    (SKIP TO THIS STEP IF YOUR VIDEO IS ALREADY IN A MP4 FORMAT)  2) After ripping the DVD or video into a MP4 format, then you will need to import into iTunes.   If you don't have iTunes, you can download a free version iTunes 7 onto your computer.    Import the converted MP4 files (try to remember where you ripping software placed the files) into the iTunes library.   FILE-->IMPORT    3)Finally connect your iPod to the computer with the iTunes software running.   If the iPod update doesn't run automatically, you can manually start it by FILE--->UPDATE iPOD.   After the update you should be able to find your video in the iPod menu as VIDEO-->MOVIES.   The properties in the iTunes library does control where the file lands in the iPod menu, so be careful if you decide the change the file settings.

AA11549416	If you can view your Creative Zen as a storage device/additional drive in Windows Explorer (it should appear as a new drive shortly after connecting via USB cable), then you can drag and drop songs from your iTunes library view into the appropriate folder in Creative Zen.    I've included a link from Apple on downloading to a different device (cell) but it works the same way.   Also Creative has some infomation on their site in general on downloading songs, you will need to work around Apple's copyright schemes which I believe Zen supports.
AA11549416	I'm guessing you mean playing a video in the Nano or older audio-only iPods.   Video Podcasts will not play in the audio-only versions of the iPod. The iPod (30Gb+) with Video does supports the MP4 or .mov format of the Video Podcasts as you mentioned.   Another option is to play the Video Podcasts on your computer using iTunes.
AA11549416	Need more details, the processes vary widely by brand and model number (e.g. Creative Zen Vision) and provided software run on which platorm (e.g. XP).  Be sure you have the proper codecs on your player and the video is not copyright protected.

I'd recommend the Vision W if you plan to spend considerable time playing videos.   You can run a side-by-side comparison of the Creative players at the following link:
5IttGRxtaa	http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/compa...  Umm personally I would go for the Pro if you are going to use Xbox Live. I have got 20GB and I am always having to delete things which is a big pain.  If you are going to use Live do yourself a favour and go with the 60GB.  Trust Me :D  Also if you are going to join parties and use Xbox Live you have to buy extras with the Arcade which costs money... obviously  Hope I helped :D|`|A3131PIoaa	Hey, I got a 60 gb hard drive and I have like 70 games saved and i still have like 10 gbs left. so get the 60gb.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	it depends on how many games you purchase and are saved on your hard drive.    i have a 60g and 44 available and i have a fair amount of games downloaded... it all depends.|`|NdrO7u79aa	I would get the 60 gb HD based on my gaming style. I download a lot of demos before I'll rent or buy a game, and those take up space. Also, a lot of games have updates that you'll have to download from time to time, or expansion packs, etc.     I think in the long run you'll be happier if you spend a little extra now to get the extra storage.|`|48EBbwMOaa	I recommend 60 GB because:  1. You have better xbox live gaming experience  2. It is more popular  3. In 20 GB after you buy like 20 games you need to start deleting some memory    I know 60 GB is expensive but it is worth it|`|kBSlNEL2aa	If you don't mined buying many different hard drives for your xbox then it is perfectly fine.  You will fill that 20GB hard drive up pretty fast if you plan on playing online.  My advice to you is wait and get the 120GB that way you don't waste money buy 2 hardrives...BTW I doubt very seriously that you can get a 20GB hardrive for $20 unless its used. You can find everything you need here...    http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductD...    BTW they have 20GB hardrives for $59.99(used)|`|MUGkpfn8aa	Nope. I recommend 60 or even the 120, because I bought the premium when they had 20gb drives, and currently trying to get the cable to transfer all my data to a new one i got for Christmas..not good, and really not worth all the hassle..

But apart from that i can't help.|`|HekFanRvaa	nope, but if you really like backwards compatible PS3, it will cost an extra $100. With $100, you can buy a PS2... at least pre-owned one.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Only the 40GB now has an emulator, the only one that can play ps2 games|`|YaWcQZTxaa	The only way you can is if your ps3 came backwards compatable.

bYlEqiKVaa	It's pretty clear that Video Man works for StashSpace.com or at least benefits in some way from that site, because every one of his answers urge users to use the service.    Buy Dazzle by Pinnacle.  They sell it at best buy and circuit city (possibly Fry's also) and it's not too expensive.  Plus, you don't have to mail your tapes in anywhere, hoping they come back unscathed, if at all.  Buying your own software/hardware bundle gives you the freedom to do it yourself if you're tech savvy (and it sounds like you are).  Furthermore, Dazzle/Pinnacle are designed to be incredibly user friendly, and there is really a very small learning curve to begin with, but most of it is common sense -- it comes with a video input hub, where you connect your VCR/Camcorder to RCA inputs (red, white, and yellow cord) or S-Video inputs, both of which are analog, to USB or Firewire to upload to your computer, thereby converting the analog signal to digital.    From there, you can edit that footage, burn it to a DVD, Flash drive, Online video hosting site (youtube), whatever.    Don't have someone else do it, when you can enjoy the freedom and ability to do it whenever you'd like!  These programs are becoming cheaper and easier to use because of the high demand from consumers wanting to turn old analog tapes into DVDs.  It's a very popular demand, and you can benefit from it!    Just go to Best Buy or any large chain electronics store and ask one of the computer/camcorder specialists to point it out for you and explain it for you.  I'm sure they'd be happy to help you out.    Good luck!|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	You may take a look at this guide, it's about how to capture video from VHS to computer and burn to DVD, it works pretty well for me  http://www.freedvdripper.net/how-to-capt...

There is the free download link:  http://topsreviews.com/video-converter/v...|`|W0KQTXrvaa	i brought it to a professional to do it|`|7w2kCTDJaa	They sell a video to DVD recorder. Check Best Buy, I think Wal Mart carries them as well. They are about $300 & up I believe.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Yes, you need a PC with a TV capture card, which is not the same thing as a video card.    Depending on where you live, a good TV capture card might cost between 70-150 dollars US.  The card will have plugs that can take input from a video player, or other devices. Not every video player has output plugs on it, so you you need to make sure that yours does, preferably stereo output plugs. You will need to get the right cable to go into the PC from an electronics store, most likely an RCA cable, but it might be something else.    You then play the video, hit record on the software that comes with your TV card, and capture the video as an AVI file. Then you use a program like winAVI video converter or Avi-to-DVD to burn it to a dvd in the correct DVD format. Most DVD players now recognise AVI files anyway, so you might be able to just burn it to dvd and use it straight away.    You also might be able to find services in the yellow pages that will transfer videos to dvd for you.|`|AeEuNkKZaa	You can convert VHS to DVD with StashSpace    Mail them your tapes.  They convert them to digital files $7/tape (or Free with a Premium account and their current free tape transfer promo)     You can get DVDs made right away or use their online video editor to create custom DVDs with content from multiple tapes, custom titles, and chapter points.  I had them convert my home movie collection and they did a great job.  They burn the DVDs for you for $15 and ship them back to you with your original tapes.    Go to http://www.stashspace.com to learn more and get started or give them a call.

AA11549416	In general carriers using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) offer better coverage in the USA than GSM/GPRS (global coverage popular overseas or iDen (Nextel Only). General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)  transmits and receives data in packets and is used to boost wireless data transmission over GSM networks.  It is ten times faster data transmission than standard GSM service, the GPRS data packet approach is an important distinction between CDMA and GPRS/GSM .  Companies offering the GSM/GPRS phone service include AT&T Wireless, Cingular, and T-Mobile.   So if simply transmitting voice is mostly what you need then either will work fine, if you need to transmit data (e.g. transmit video), then GPRS is a much faster service.  Go to Wikipedia (link below) for all the gory details:

j5Apt8hWaa	There are very few P&S cameras with 20x zooms, none of which cost nearly 20K in USD.    You can do some research here to find them.    http://www.dpreview.com    If you are taking about 20K in USD, then you are using P&S nomenclature to discribe focal lengths .. you wlll need to be clear on what subjects you are planning to shoot.    At present you could buy the beginnings of a good camera system that would cover everything but field sports like baseball, football and soccer.    The base line lenses would be 24-70 mm f/2.8. 70-200 f/2.8 (either Nikon or Canon), then a Nikon 105 mm macro or Canon 100 mm macro, and for wide angle shooting either the Nikon 14-24 mm or Canon 16-35 mm zooms.  If yo add up the total "zoom" reach with those lenses you are still only coming up with a 14x reach with the Nikon lenses and 12.5x with the Canon lenses.  You would have to buy a 300 mm f/2.8 to get to your "dream" 20x and that would blow your budget.Nikon does make a very nice 200-400mm f/4 zoom that would give you a total of 28x when the lenses were added together.    Finding a Nikon or Canon DSLR that will use AA batteries in a pinch, you would have to go with the Nikon D700 with MB-D10 battery grip which will use either the excellent Nikon LI-ion battery or AA alkaline's, but the Canon 5D, Mark II battery grip does not accept AA batteries.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	canon 1D or nikon F3|`|QYB6oRacaa	Canon 1Ds Mark III with Battery Grip    24-70 L 70-200 2.8 IS L    There you go!

9976086d0726fc1b18200f0ff0c86850aa	Here's some helpful advice, okay. I  f you have any CD's you can "RIP"/"Import" it to iTunes. -all that music will now be in your iTunes library. Then you plug in your iPod and transfer the music from the library to your iPod. Easy as that. BTW: You can if you want to download songs from the iTunes store...but it's 0.99 cents for each song...or you can go to your local: best buy, target, wal-mart or store & buy an iTunes music card this allows you to download songs from iTunes also - it's said to be safer than using your credit card to download music.    I hope this helps you alot & soon you'll be rockin' to your iPod :]|`|3192dd71479f39e347fbd4f88c2c90f3aa	type limewire in on the google search box, and click a limewire link, download the program and you'll be able to put songs, music videos etc. on your ipod.|`|caa71fafc43ca31c69915147df3c7e9caa	yes limewire, i no its illeagal to download but idk my friend has it, and  its free|`|94666d8433adb765940a827023ad1ccdaa	play games,watch movies,watch tv episodes, and listen to music of course!|`|87280d027843879562e8912c92179ceaaa	Yep, but first of all, you need to register your iPod to your computer so that it can recognize your iPod. Then, you need to go to www.itunes.com and download the softwear for free. It's up to you if you want to buy songs. You can always go to target , best buy, or anywhere who sells iTune cards so that you can download music (It's safer). In my opinion this is better that way you don't have to worry how much apple charged you for purchasing music. Enjoy your ipod! I luv my iPod. I have a black 60GB. I already have movies, games , shows and of course music.|`|1385672cd9139423cf9435785c2a86b9aa	First, the ipod comes with a CD that will install the itunes store access, as well as the ipod program for loading songs you already have into the player.     Since you didn't mention a software problem, I'll assume that you didn't get the CD...     You can still load songs into the player with WinXP and the Windows Media Player you already have.   Versions included with new units since 2005 have a "sync" feature for loading songs into most media players (MP3 players in particular).   To find out if you have this software and the sync feature, go to Start -  My Music and click on any file you find there (most come with a few sample files, and may be in a "Samples" folder), this should open Media Player as the default software for sound files.   *It's also accessible thru Start - My Documents - My Music*  **Also, you can Search your system for "MP3", then double-click any files that turn up in the results.     Media Player will create your playlists, and collect your library for you by searching your sustem for sound files.     You can also download the latest version of the access software from Apple.com if Media Player doesn't suit your needs.     *(BTW: I wholesale ipods, and have a few spare CDs lying around if you get cornered for one, or we can also exchange it over the Web via ftp...just a thought to keep in mind.)     As for free music: While not entirely legal, there are many exchange servers available where you can get most music for free.   These file-sharing programs are member supported, and are free to join and use...All you need is the software to access the service.   They are all a bit risky, and mostly illegal...but they have been around for quite a while.     There are also many legal ways to get free MP3s, and a quick Yahoo search for "Free MP3 files" will turn up enough to keep you busy.   The best approach is to join an "unlimited downloads" site (for a monthly fee, from $5-10, you can collect all the files your modem can handle.) and stay on the local law enforcement's good side.   These sites will also turn up in the Yahoo search for MP3 files.     Your problem has 2 steps;  Collect some music, and synchronize your collection to your player.     You may already have a few sample songs in your computer that have been unused, so look for them first...and if Media Player is up-to-date (the upgrades are free from Microsoft.com) it will sync your player with your collection...then all you have to do is find and collect more songs.     Much luck.

iu2pBEb2aa	If your TV is region-free (ie, supports NTSC, PAL and SECAM), then it may just be changing a setting (though this would be rare).    More than likely you're going to need a physical adapter to convert the NTSC signal to PAL. Be careful - since this is an active conversion the quality of the adapter does matter.
BHeBy9BBaa	No, I have tried also.  What I did find was Pageonce.  Its a productivity assistant and i can watch my bank accounts, credit cards, email, bills etc..  Its the closest thing you'll find.

Try Cucusoft ipod video converter,it support convert video to iPod directly. Some other software need two steps: 1. convert video to avi; 2. convert output avi to iPod. That solution wastes lots of your time. We need only one step, direct convert video DVD to iPod.

jwOJeFliaa	1) Yes it will have similar expansions (but better ones)    2) It is going to be different, you have to go to the hospital to have a baby, or you can have it home the benefits are unknown right now. There will be more gameplay.    3) The base game will only have 1 neighbourhood. If you meet the minimum requirements, it shouldn't lag at all. (unlike the sims 2)    4)Yes you will be able to find out early tomorrow morning on www.snootysims.com. It might be delayed a week, or until the 17 of march
Ld1vLH8Kaa	Yes from what I can tell the processer is 2.2ghz and it has 2 Gig of memory so it meets Sims 3 Minimums|`|Dso7k3sjaa	It definitely sounds like it would be good enough, but I'm not sure.  Here is a link that will take you to a graph which shows what video cards will actually play the Sims 2 games well and which ones will not.  The card listed in your link is not actually on this chart, so I am just not sure.  But, I still felt you might want to take a look at the chart:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    The information on this chart was actually gathered by input from real people trying to play the sims 2 games on their computers -- there are a LOT of people registered at MTS2, which is the site that gathered this information and made this chart.  It is not something that EA made as EA's minimum specs and recommended system requirements do not actually let you play the game well, and sometimes not at all.    I have seen their new "minimum" system recommendations for The Sims 3 games and I know already that there are going to be people who buy that game and are unable to play it even though their computer meets the requirements.  :-(    But everything else listed as being in that computer definitely looks good.  Perhaps you could have the company put a different video card into it before you buy it -- or you could replace the card yourself if you find it necessary.    eta -- I just put that video card into a google search box.  Everything I can find on that card makes it sound like it will definitely be good enough.  :-)|`|UbB5qnX9aa	if it is a laptop yes on some of them but it would go really slow but a desktop would be perfecto
AQ4b4Iilaa	You don't need liveview and it should not be the main criteria for choosing a dSLR.  Do you really want to hold a heavy dSLR at arms length while looking at the LCD???  A dSLR is not a small compact camera!    The Sony A200 doesn't have liveview either, but is a better camera than the D40.  Compare the features.  Buy Minolta lenses cheaply off eBay!    Liveview on the Canon is AWFUL!|`|nW3iJkT5aa	There are many manufacturers, but bear in mind the two most reputable manufacturers Canon & Nikon have many years experience & have developed an incredible range of lenses between them  Be aware also of the current speed of development .You can buy the latest model  & it will be out of date before you get it home  My advice would be--- Go to a specialist photographers like Jessops where the staff are trained in photography unlike a Curries or pc world where they are trained to sell  You will be able to handle the various models & most importantly you will get expert advice  ps the Nikon d40 is a good camera tho I am a canon EOS  40D man myself  Good luck|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	I have a D40.....what a great camera. I'm not saying it's any better than many others you might consider but it will do everything you need it to do.|`|QYB6oRacaa	The only beginners camera with live view that I can recommend is the XSi as DSLR are meant to be used with the viewfinder.    XSi can enable live view but more steps are needed to auto focus and all that ..    D40 D60 XS XSi are all good beginners camera, however the XSi is the only one with live view capabilities|`|cUQI6xPUaa	Nikon D40 is a entry-level DSLR camera and so is the D60 (I have this one). Both doesn't have live view, though. If you want an entry-level DSLR, go for the more expensive Canon 1000D or the 450D.    My friend at the office has a Canon 450D. He said it drains the power of the battery faster. If you opt to buy one, better be prepared. Buy an extra battery.|`|IvkZNs0caa	Using Live View on a DSLR has three very significant "costs" -  1. Slower operation (focusing and shutter lag, the delay between pressing the shutter release and the exposure being made).  2. Very heavy power drain, the batteries run down much more quickly when using Live View!  3. Lower quality photographs because it is more difficult to hold the camera properly and to compose shots with LV and it is often much harder to compose shots in bright light.    But if you are sure that feature is something you want IMO the best affordable implementations are from Olympus and Sony.  I would suggest that you get an Image Stabilized (Anti Shake) model camera if you expect to use LV very much.  I believe this rules out Canon and Nikon cameras because they build the anti-shake features into lenses not the camera bodies.    Both Olympus and Sony include built in anti-shake features in some of their camera bodies which means the feature works with all of the lenses.  Keep in mind that Sony has lots of experience with anti-shake features from manufacturing professional quality video cameras.    Olympus was the first to introduce Live View in a DSLR and currently has two low-medium priced models and two high end models available with LV here are links to the E-420 basic model and the E-520 intermediate model with anti-shake and an extra lens from a reputable on-line dealer.    http://www.adorama.com/IOME420KA.html  http://www.adorama.com/IOME520K1A.html     And here are a couple of the Sony models that are similar in features and price from the same dealer.    http://www.adorama.com/ISODSLRA300A.html  http://www.adorama.com/ISODSLRA300C.html    HTH.

Phone them back and asked to get put through to the UTL help desk who will be able to track your delivery down to the courier depot.

I think the whole band kit is also $50 cheaper than the GH:WT band kit.    Don't just stick with name recognition, GH:WT was a rushed half-assed gamed that is not at the level of Rock Band 2.  Harmonix (developers of the Rock Band series) created Guitar Hero 1&2 then split off and went to go make Rock Band.  Activision/Neversoft (think tony hawk) bought the GH franchise, made bad attempts to recreate the games and they are selling like crazy because of the Guitar Hero name.  Just because it has the brand name doesn't mean it's better.

And since you don't pay for online I doubt Nintendo is at a very big rush to fix the problem.  This has been going on for a few months and there's not much you can do about it except cheating yourself (which more people are starting to do).    You need a modded wii and you can hack one of the files so that you can use the cheat online.   Time to start playing with only friends if you want a fair race.

SKkE3fK1aa	Nope, as long as you are able to play the file with the 'unupgraded REAL PLAYER' then you shouldn't worry about it being supported by the upgraded one.    Media Formats are played through CODECS (Compressor-Decompressor). So if you do have a file that is unable to be played by REAL, then its not REAL Players fault. Your computer just doesn't have a CODEC for it.    About the upgrade, it only upgrades features such as a better user interface, more support, etc. it doesn't affect playback.    >>> I know you dont want other softwares but if you got time, you should get K-Lite Codec Pack Pro, its free and its a pack of CODEC that will ensure you that all formats are playable in your preferred media player.

Lo trovi, credo, ad un prezzo accettabile e sono ottimi, sia per il software che per l'assistenza e gli aggiornamenti.

You are required to have a PSP capable of running unsolicited code, meaning a PSP with Firmware 1.5 or as high as 3.03 (you must downgrade from here to do this). All the information you could need for anything PSP can be found at PSPUpdates.com. There are tutorials on how to do nearly anything with your PSP, just poke around a bit.
3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	or perhaps you can tell them you got it as a gift and now you dont know what is wrong with it. that is if you still have all the box and stuffings it came with. they always exchange electronics but no refunds.    psphacks.com has a lot of folks who have done the same thing and it worked for them. and as for not bricking it again, id suggest you read their forums to avoid it again.|`|48c21cf4024a52e6bcf2e57ad70d6574aa	Sorry but when you threw away the reciept you possibly threw away your chances. Only thing I can think of is that if you have the original box and all the crap that game with it, you could say it has been defaulty, and back up your point by saying stuff like Sony produced defaulty PSP a while back, hopefully you will be able to get store credit or a new PSP. And next time dont mod your psp its just not worth it.|`|CEC1TVojaa	if you threw away the receipt, then that just puts away your chances of returning it. if i were you, i would call sony and tell them your problem. Next time dont throw away the receipt of something that is worth a lot of money like that.    by the way, sony's number is 1-800-345-7669
3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	psp only reads mp3 files for music. whe you have those , after you plugin your usb and go to the right drive, look for the music folder. if not one then make it in all caps (MUSIC) then put your mp3 file in the folder

3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	how did you brick your psp downgrading any way?? its so simple if you read the tutorials right. but no there is no fix for it unless you are already on cutomware and have the reboot folders. sony probably wont fix your stuff unless you pay because they frown on the hacking|`|qEwd2wtraa	The memory chip inside is damage or wiped out. you have to remove it and put one with data in instead. Try to see if sony support is willing to help but not sure how much they will charge.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	No. It will not work because the PSP's system memory has been wipped out.    The only way to fix a bricked PSP is to use a mod chip.
3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	those guys are retards. the rar files are like winzip. only its winrar. you dl the winrar to unzipp your files. its free.  after you dl it all you do is right click the file and "extract here". then you will either have a iso file or a cso file . those you put in the iso folder of your psp. if you dont have one then make it "ISO" no quotes, all caps. you put the folder on your first page of your psp after you open through the usb.   all this only if you have customware thought. look on your system info and if it dosent have letters behind you version then you cant play these files. got to this site for all other questions you may have about the psp.http://www.psp-spot.com/forums/index.php...   this siite can tell you where to get the winrar as well. you might be able to get the customware if you have the right system version of sonyware.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Ask Sony customer service.  They're really helpful.|`|2V1hwJWpaa	First of all you have to have Devhook on your PSP to get a ISO file to work.  I don't know hot to get Devhook because a friend did it to me.    If you want to download, you would have to download from Chinese web pages or use torrents.
3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	it would be best to upgrade to the custom ware. like the 3.03oec( that i have) or the newer 3.40oea. that way you will be able to play games that are new   plus the plugins and other apps might need the higher customware to activate. the newer the firmware the newer the games you can play. go to http://www.psp-spot.com/forums/index.php...    they have the info you need to upgrade and the firmware you want. as well as other cool shtuff|`|a3b8f8499e0462dd7a325da9b0152e1faa	yep u can have a worth try
3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	id advise you to not upgrade to that. i did twice and i am back at the 3.03oec and i am glad of it. there arent enough new games out to justify the upgrade to that firmware yet. so go to psphacks.com and look for the noob proof 3.03oec upgrader and it will be easy. all you do is put two files into the 1.50 folder. then run it thats it.
