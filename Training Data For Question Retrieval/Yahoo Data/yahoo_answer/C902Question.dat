I efiled 1/19, accepted 1/20, should have DD of 1/30 (2/3 at lates) then on 2/4 WMR site changed to still processing.... refer code 1301.  This morning (Thur 3/5/09) the WMR site changed and stated the following:      We have received your tax return and it is being processed.  Unless we find mistakes or you owe other taxes, you should receive your refund by March 17.

Interesting point of fact, I never got a ltr or anything stating there was a mistake or error on my return.   Anyone who can update me and possiibly give me a little hope would be appreciated.

I still owe about 20K on the balance of the loan, the truck would sell-today for around 11K-12K.      Do you think the bank that owns the loan would allow me to sell the truck to pay a portion of my debt, and continue paying the loan-remainder, or possibly renegotiate the balance-due so I could have lower payments?      I hope I explained this adequately to get an accurate answer.      Basically, my truck is eating my monthly income. I need to get a car that is much smaller and older, and hopefully economical.

I am 6 months pregnant, work for the army as a Family Readiness Support Assistant. A week ago, one of the more important volunteers came into my office and told me I should walk away with a smile from my job. Yesterday my DCO (Deputy Commanding Officer) the greensuiter that hired me in MAY of 2008, gave me his unsolicited advice that I should quit also. I feel alienated, isolated. And now my job is stressing me out.   I feel pressured to quit my job, FRSA's are not permanent, we just went TERM, we go Permanent in October. Can they get rid of me. I go on bedrest at the end of this month. But this being a high risk pregnancy, they are causing undue stress and we all know what the job market looks like. From my understanding, I can work from home while on bedrest, but with new Commanders it is hard to figure out what to do. My Brigade will be deploying late this year-very late, and I will be back by then. But the pressure and stress is causing me not to sleep well, worrying, not eating well, when Being pregnant should be a happy joyous time.    I feel like my right to bear children has been taken away. I have never taken off sick since Ive been pregnant. I have been there, stayed late if I had to, and never used my pregnancy as an excuse to not perform my duties or go above and beyond. Any help, advice would be greatly appreciated.    Ive been told to file an EO complaint because now Im working in a hostile environment- people want me to quit because Im pregnant and pregnant with twins, will be having twins and feel like I wont be there, not sure.

I applied for housing benefit a month ago after being made redundant and it was certainly an lengthy process (more forms than you can imagine). Wanting to be honest about everything and not hide any thing when I spoke to the benefits people I explained that I live with my boyfriend in a shared rented accommodation but because of our religion we rent two desperate rooms and are not married ( see this is the complicated bit). Other than making him dinner occasionally, we don't really pay for each other and act independently (so very much like living in two homes)       Now they have told me that because I live with my boyfriend he should pay for my up keep.      This has infuriated me because until now I have always tried to remain independent and I feel my religious beliefs (that forbid us sharing a room) now means we have to pay two lots of rent and our low resources are even more hit.       Am I right to be upset? can I appeal? again I'll stress we aren't married and if I had lied and not said we were dating they wouldn't have known I would probably be full of benefits right now.

His sister converted to the Mormon religion when she moved to America and we talked to her at the funeral of our friend. As we did not know much about the Mormons, we discussed it with her and it was then we found out that she had gathered all three 'into the Mormon fold'. I told her that I knew that her family were totally opposed to her religion and that they would be horrified to know what she had done. She assured me that this was not so and it was her work and that she was the one chosen to do this for her family. she also told me that she had fallen out with her cousins over this.   I am now so angry over this and as I have started to research my family tree and found that ancestry.com and co.uk are lead my Mormons, I want to find another company. how can I be sure who isn't?

I asked for his number and she told me she wasn't supposed to give it out, I told her I wasn't going to sign it because it didn't sound right and I need to ask somebody about it. She told me that she would have him call me. I talked to him and he was yelling and screaming saying he was going to sue me, take me to court, yada yada. In the end I told him I wasn't going to pay for the month and was going to be out by the 8th, he said fine pay for the eight days and leave. I told him I was going to use the security deposit to pay for the eight days and he said that I can't do that. I know I'm going to have a hell of a time getting anything from the deposit and just want to know if I can use the deposit to pay this amount. My lease says that it can't be used to pay any portion of the rent under the lease but since right now I have no lease can I do this? Thank you and sorry for the long explanation.

I cannot advise any one to trust these with profits bonds -- it would seem that the only people who benefit are the Directors and Managers giving themselves huge bonuses earned with Savers money .

But in refusing to give up or cut his pension, Sir Fred is only acting in pattern with present big-business culture. The market says you're worth what you can get; markets have nothing to do justice or need. Sir Fred has got his pension perfectly legally under market rules. His case is symptomatic of the whole attitude of big business to money-making. An ethically more sensitive man might feel obliged to give up some of the money but he's only doing what the law and business culture allow. 'It's the system' - truth in a cliche.

I am from Manchester I owned a textile business since 1998 with approximately 100 staff, the business was going well until    two years ago.   I was importing and exporting but over the last two years the business has been in a steady decline, I have also had to reduce my staff   levels and now have only five people working in the factory.   My factory and my home both have high mortgages.   I have taken out loans for my business, I have re-mortgaged my house and used all the available money on my credit cards.   I now find myself in a position where I am unable to make any of the repayments and the interest is increasing up daily.   I am struggling to pay the five remaining staff.   I do not know what to do, I have considered suicide but I have two children and I really must think about them.   I have considered running away and leaving all the debts behind but I do not have any money to start a new life anywhere else.   If anyone has any advice to offer as to how I can deal with this and get some sort of normality back in to my life I would be very grateful

20090305073651AAlgc2h	Business & Finance;Insurance	HELP!  Unemployment appeal tomorrow?	To sum it up, prior to my maternity leave we made a verbal agreement for me to work part time upon my return from leave. Two weeks before I was due back to work I got a call saying they need me back full time. I already made arrangements for a part time babysitter and didn't have a full time babysitter.   I asked if I could get two weeks to look for a daycare and she said ok. in those two weeks I couldn't find any daycares that had immediate openings and asked to take the two weeks of my accrued vacation at which point I was told ok but that my job isn't guaranteed.      I wrote another email keeping her up to date with my daycare search and received no response back.      Then all of a sudden I received an email stating that they found someone else that they are hiring permanently and that they would like my last day to be Friday (two days from then).      Then she called me and left a voicemail requesting a resignation letter in order to give me a good reference. My husband and I met with her and she again requested a resignation letter and so I agreed. I wanted a good reference for my future job and had no idea that it was going to interfere with my unemployment.      The voicemails have been deleted form my phone somehow after 3 months and all I have is an email where she is letting me go and telling me when my last day will be.  And also my resignation letter that i wrote is dated 3 days later after termination date.       Do you think that its enough to prove that I was forced to resign?
20090305084222AAdlmSr	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I be nervous about the slowdown in showings?	Our house has been on the market for 3 weeks.  In the first 2 weeks we had 8 showings.  All of the realtors said the house shows very well and we have 2 people who are interested, but must sell their homes first (I've seen the houses and what they're asking, and I'm not holding my breath!).  We priced our house at the lowest price of the range suggested by our realtor, which is in  line with similar homes that have sold.  So far, no one is scheduled to come through this weekend...in fact, no one has been in since last Saturday, which is making me nervous.  Should I be?  Do I need to give it a few more weeks before spring buyers come out?  I didn't know what to expect, my last house was on the market in June, had 30 showings in a week and then sold...so this is freaking me out.  I am in a smaller town now, about half the size.  Do I need to relax and give it time?  Do I need to reduce the price??

20090305082440AABPTFf	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How do I withdraw my job application?	I recently applied for a job with a company that I would love for a much lower position.  At the time, I figured that I could get the job and work my way up quickly.  There are several tests that need to be written to even get to the interview stage and I’ve passed one of the tests with the second test scheduled for tomorrow.      I’ve been told that should I pass tomorrow’s test, my references will be contacted.  I’ve realized in the past little while that I really can’t afford to take the pay cut and I don’t want my references to be contacted for a job that I wouldn’t even accept.      I would like to pull out of the selection process and stop wasting everyone’s time, but I really would love to work for this company, just not in this particular position.  How should I approach this so as not to burn my bridges?  Can I tell the truth – I’m interested in working for this company, but not at this level?  Or should I just close the door on this company for a stupid decision in applying in the first place?

20090305081705AAlsJ4v	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Is it too late to charge him?	My boyfriend and I are promoting a Strongman Competition this spring. Someone contacted us yesterday about setting  up a booth with his products and wants to have a drawing for a piece of equipment. My boyfriend talked to him and didn't say anything about charging him for the space. He also talked to him about sponsoring one of our events. He is going to provide 2 pieces of equipment for the event that he is sponsoring and he will get $100 off the rate.       So my question is: Is it too late for me to tell him that there will be a fee for the space (up until now this hasn't been something we were considering for this event). It wouldn't be a large fee but I feel that he will be gaining a lot from this event being there will be news coverage and many spectators.       Oh, I am e-mailing him now with all the details of the sponsorship and going over specifics and such with him. If you think I should charge him, how would you bring it up in an e-mail?

I received a contract of employment for a 1-Month "Probationary" period (24th November to 24th December). I was told verbally that after this one month my performance/application would be reviewed and if all was well I would be offered a permanent contract and a higher salary. I am still working for the company now and still getting paid but after asking for the contract/pay rise I am getting no correspondance.      To make matters more confusing the company was bought out and ceased to be a legal entity on 31st January and my employment was transferred under TUPE to the new company. The company I am with now current is on a pay freeze but surely even though the agreement was verbal I should still be entitled to both the contract and pay rise under the terms set out in TUPE.      Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.

During my 3d interview yesterday, the Communication Manager has asked me to provide her with something I'd written in English (i'm French).  Now I'm stuck... which subject, how, long? I'm thinking to write about the Company's area of work, although I know nothing about it. I could do some research but I'm scared I'd lack precision in the eyes of a professional.  Any other subject is at risk too. I don't think writing about art or music would be advised either... Do you have some advice?  thanks a lot!

20090305081417AAy8eH3	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	So then Why Should the Rest of Us Pay Taxes ?	Just read a story that's breaking this morning about 22 legislators in Georgia that have refused to pay their taxes, including some Senators and the like. The story is at  http://www.macon.com/198/story/640079.ht...    And how many of Obama's nominees to various cabinet positions have had to withdraw their names due to tax problems ... is it 5 now?   So is this just a big game or what? The big guys don't have to pay, they just pass the laws that make the little guys pay?   I have faithfully paid my taxes for 23 years now ... since I started my first job at 15 years old.    But I'm not filing income tax returns this year.    You can go ahead and put a lien on my house. It's upside down anyway, due to the collapsing economy that these guys caused.   So my question is ... am I the only one out there who finds it strange that all of these elected officials conveniently "forgot" to pay taxes, or "made a mistake" on their taxes, or "didn't know I had to pay" for their taxes?

20090305081834AAIyOOo	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Employment Contract Question?	I am employed under fixed-term contract terms. When one contract expires, or is about to expire, the pattern over more than two years has been that another immediately followed, on identical terms and conditions with the role focusing on similar work areas. Several weeks ago the intended issuance of a further such contract was confirmed by my employers in writing, the only matters to be determined being the precise duties in the JD and funding source, and these matters were to be dealt with imminently. In the following weeks repeated efforts to actually sign the new contract that had been previously confirmed in writing (and following the previous pattern) have not come to anything despite repeated requests and I suspect there may have been a change of heart. Is the written confirmation I refer to enforceable, i.e. is it an implied contract?

A friend of mines recently did his taxes but it went in for review and now the government wants him to provide proof of taking care of niece and nephew.      Situation: He and his mother currently live together. His mother is on disability so she does not file taxes. My friend is the only one working in the household. And currently his sister's twin newborns (born July 2008) reside with them. The sister (only 16) stays with an aunt because of convenience to attend school.       This friend is only 20 years old and a guy of course claiming newborns that are his niece and nephew, so the government kicked his return back.  What kind of proof can he give the government to claim the kids. He is providing over half the household support and the kids stayed with them since birth.      Help, he is frantic because no one wants to receive a letter from the IRS. Even though he did receive half of the amount stated on his return.       Should he have claimed the kids as his son and daughter instead of niece and nephew because his sister does not do anything for them? Does anyone know if government audits people alot because the claim their siblings or niece/nephew?

20090305083923AAuaxS9	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Verbal Agreements on a Lease?	I was apartment hunting online and found something that looked okay in Queens, NY.  I live upstate, so I contacted the guy via email, who was moving out to live with his girlfriend.  Technically, I'd be sub-leasing from him. The rent was a short-term thing- 4 months.  I spent a month figuring out if I could afford it, and I called him and I told him that I'd take the apartment. It was a little out of my budget, but I hadn't found anything else. That was 2 weeks ago.  We decided to figure out payments once I was in the area.  Two days ago, a friend of the family offered to let me live in his fully-furnished condo for $400 a month cheaper, all utilities included.  I contacted the guy from the old apartment to tell him I wouldn't be moving in next week, and not surprisingly, he's really upset.  He wants me to pay this month's rent being we had a verbal agreement.  Am I bound to this?

I'm 26 years old, and I'm going to be graduating from nursing school in June, and some hospitals are already starting their hiring process.  My question is regarding the application where it asks if you've ever had a misdemeanor or felony...         When I was 16 or 17 (definitely under 18), I got caught smoking pot. I may have gotten a misdemeanor, I don't remember but I did have to see a judge periodically to get my urine tested.  Do I need to confess to it even if I was under 18? I don't want them to not want to hire me because of that, but if I don't tell them, I don't want them to think I was hiding it from them if they DO get that information.  What should I do?

My question is do we pay off his old old old medical bills from 6 years ago they add up to 4,000 in all to make his credit score hire then go through the bank to refinance to 8% to save on intrest but have to pay closing cost again or do we just double up our payments to the man we are buying this house from.        Oh my boyfriend wants to borrow from his TSP and pay his self back.  He has 15,000 but at the end of the year he should have 20,000 which is how much we we owe on the house by the end of the year.  He said he could borrow up to 80% and he said he could take out a personal loan through his bank for the rest.      Please help what is the best thing to do.  With the economy going the way it is, the more we own and the less we owe the better.  I just want to get things paid off so if he looses his job one day we will only have utilities to pay for.            Sorry so long hope someone can help

20090305084354AAkfLrV	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	I think that I have been conned and dont know what to do?	It seems that I have signed a guarantee for a large amount of money. I have been ordered to pay by a court but I still think that I was conned into signing the guarantee. I have never seen the document. I was not provided with the document either before or after the signing. I signed a single piece of paper having been told that it was an agreement to release shares in a company to the lender. I think that the lender and the director of the company who agreed the original loan to the company 'stitched me up' between them. The director unbeknown to me had sent a letter to the lenders solicitor committing me to guaranteeing the loan long before I signed the piece of paper. I always said that I wished to see the document before I signed, and I may not have signed if I had been given the chance to read it through. I have made no gain from this but I suspect that the lender the director and the companies bank have. Something is wrong here but I need good advice

20090305092405AAVj9b2	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Does anyone agree that all Overtime worked should be tax exempt?	If the politicians really want to help the middle income and poor of this country.  Try making OT tax exempt.  Taking money from the so called rich to pay the middle and lower income, will only take their incentive away.  Oh, I know there would be some salaried people left out.  In that case renegotiate your compensation with your employer.   Think of the American workers this would help.  Waitresses, mechanics, utility workers. manufacturing workers etc. etc.  The people that are willing to work more than 40 hrs should be better compensated and not one dime would have to come from a so called stimulus bill.   The tax loss would be minimal, but the increased income for the hard working people would be a major boost to the local economy's.     Would some employees create unnecessary OT?  Only if supervisors allow it.

Instead it will be on 2009's 1098t.      Can I still deduct this expense without a corresponding 1098 for that tax year?

20090305093617AA0TPrU	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What should I do????	I worked at a job for 3 1./2 years and was fired from it last April for a mistake that cost the company a loss of like $600 after fighting with the Union to get my job back and having no  luck eventually the employer agreed to just say that I quit instead of I got terminated and they paid me for all of my sick and vacation and personal time. Which they hadn't previously planned to do. It took me like 4 months after that to find a job in the same field but the question came up as to why I no longer worker for my previous employer and at first I said lack of hours until I quickly thought about it and the interviewer said something like "well you went from having a little hours to no hours. That makes a lot of sense to quit." So then I quickly switched to well yea they cut my hours but there was a little more to it they would have me work by myself during times when it was extremely busy for at least three hours at a time sometimes and it got to be to much.After much interrogation the interviewer finally bought the story. (Which by the way was partly true) Well a few weeks later I left that job because something better came along but sadly that job was temporary and now I'm jobless again. Now I have interviews and I'm sure the question of why I don't work for my original employer will come up. What should I say as to why I no longer work there. My friend suggested that I not put it on my job applications but I worked there for 3 1/2 years and had it not been for that mistake I might still be working there. Plus it looks good on applications for similar positions because of the extensive experience. What would you say when asked why you left your original employer without mentioning that you were fired???

20090305094407AApTwO8	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I be scared to work in compton?	I'm on the job hunt right now, and I got a call yesterday from some internet marketing firm to come in for an interview. The caller didn't go into detail about the job, and I can't find the ad, so I'm assuming it was one of those craigslist ads that doesn't give the name of the company. He gave the address of the company, which he said was in "Rancho M" something or other. But when I looked it up, it turned out to be in Compton!    So now I'm a little nervous; I'm a lower-middle class white guy, and I have very little street smarts. Should I be worried about taking a job in Compton? The company looks like it's legit, and I guess a lot depends on what I'd be doing for them, but I don't know if it's worth diving into one of the most notoriously dangerous cities in the USA.

I used to open an account with Bank of America when I've been there last year as exchange student. Unfortunately, I didn't close my account because I was waiting for some refund from Paypal, when I got the money in my paypal account I transferred them to my bank account and withdrawn from ATM machine in Thailand, I forgot about withdrawn fees, then I've owned the bank $3.      I've just check my online account and found out that it's no longer available, but something strange because I can paid $4.99 to iTune through Paypal which link with my bank account in past few days.       I just called to Bank of America and they said my account was closed since August 2008 or something and my debt is only $3, so I'm wondering what about $4.99 that Paypal has paid to iTune in March, 2009.      Anyway, I want to pay for my $3 debt but I'm living in Thailand now. Are there any way to pay off this debt?        Will this gonna affect to US visa if I request in the future?

Unfortunately, since he makes more money, we need to move to be closer to his new position (which is a state away). That being said, I went to my company to see what my options would be. I'm in very good standing, was on the brink of a promotion, and was requesting (I'm a writer) a work from home position. My boss doesn't like the idea of people working remotely and also thinks our group might be struggling financially. Therefore, letting me go might help the group out. However, I can't go without having a paycheck and in this economy I'm not sure when I can find another position. That being said, can I ask them to lay me off so I can collect unemployment? Are there any other options? I can still fulfill the job, they just refuse to work with me based on the fact that it's really perfect timing for them since they would have potentially had to lay someone off in my group soon anyways.

20090305092736AA9KLE8	Business & Finance;Investing	Why don't more American's consider investing in their education rather than in stocks during this bad economy?	For the people who DO have money in a 401k or other investments which has lost (my guess 60-80%) over the past several years, For the ones pulling out of their investments and keeping the money "under the mattress" or in cash accounts, Wouldn't it be wise to invest in your own education, learning a new skill or craft, and then re-entering the work force in a higher paying job or career?      It seems that since many decent paying careers were sent over seas or to Mexico and were replaced by menial-low paying jobs, rather than complain about your money not making money in the markets or in housing, that people should invest it in themselves which would enable them to go out make more money the hard way: by working for it.      Why is this option never pointed out in the financial news reports or other daily news reports offering tips on weathering this depression?
