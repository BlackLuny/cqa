20090309120617AAyQN1S	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Changing tattoo color...?	so about 2 months ago, i got a tattoo on my wrist   and it is the lightest blue ever.   i definitely need to get it filled in because the design was so complex and intricate,    that the artist couldn't get the small areas/fill in because my skin was so swollen and red.      that being said, i scheduled a touch up for a month from now,   and i've decided maybe i want to change the color (if that were possible).   could i cover the light blue with white?   the ink does not look as though it went deep into the dermis,   i'd say probably only on the first level for some parts,   so i don't see how it wouldn't.   but naturally, i hear white ink is a pain and that you can't cover with a lighter color.      if white wouldn't work, what would?

20090309121305AAYEtpH	Beauty & Style;Hair	My Hair Is Breaking An Inch From The Ends?	I have been carelessly straightening my hair for years, and over the last two years, it hasn't grown at all, and hairs are constantly breaking off an inch or less from the bottom. (Hence the appearance of no growth). Breakage is to the extent of having to brush my clothes down before i go out, and avoiding wearing white tops, as people think the bits on my top mean I have just been to the hairdressers and had a cut!       I have decided not to straighten my hair at all now. It is shoulder length. I am using Joico K-pak shampoo, conditioner and deep penetrating treatment (twice a week), and also taking 5000mcg biotin everyday. Will my hair get longer? Although it is breaking, it stills feels soft. It used to feel very dry, but lately feels soft after taking more care of it, yet it is still breaking. I'm too embarrassed to go and have a trim (its been a year), because of the bad shape that its in at the minute. Is there anyway I can cut the split ends myself? There is no way Im going into a salon just yet.       Will it finally start to get longer now that Im using good products, taking biotin, and not using any heat appliances????

20090309121859AApVWCu	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Girls...just a general question...?	My low rise jeans (Hollister, abercrombie especially) always feel like they're falling down even when I'm wearing a belt!!! I use the belt loops, but I've been told not to because they can tear really easily. So what's another way I can? (Keep in mind that wearing a belt doesn't really help with me wearing low rise jeans).   Can i use the pockets or something?    I know, I've asked this before, but I guess i wasn't being specific. I've tried wearing a size bigger, but it doens't help. I've tried wearing a size smaller, but it doesn't help. So I surmise it has something to do with the fabric or my body or something. But I had to walk down the hallway, trying to squeeze the fingers into the pockets trying anything to deseperately keep the jeans up. UGGGHGHHH!!!!
20090309121629AA8lQN8	Beauty & Style;Hair	How bad is it to dye one's hair these days?	Specifically, very light blonde.. does it really destroy hair? my parents don't want me dying it and i basically do it without them noticing most of the time (im already 17) because they think it has and will thin my hair and destroy it. Right now i really dont' like my hair and I want to dye it a lighter blonde since my roots are coming in already (my natural color is a medium to now dirty blonde)       Anyways I want to dye it like a light ash blonde at least but obviously all the dyes have chemicals in it that are supposed to be bad for  my hair in order to make it that light, right ? Is there a safe way to do it, or a way to take care of my hair so nothing happens to it?

My real hair color is a not so dark not so light brown. Anyways, I thought the color came out pretty nice until I decided I was too pale for it and wanted to go lighter. Last week, I got high-lights done and the majority of the dark brown color faded but you could definitely tell my hair was too dark to be natural.      My high-lights don't look the way I wanted them to and my hair is beginning to break because of the bleach. I honestly hate the way it looks right now and I'm sorry I don't have pictures to show you.      What I'm saying is, could I buy the dark brown box color again and do my hair sometime this week or should I just wait and live with my mistake? I mean, I really honestly hate it, I look so bad with it.       I'm extremely self-conscious and I'm freaking out on what to do?! I asked my hair stylist but her info was to keep getting it done which I AM NOT doing!!

OKAY HERE GOES   i have very very dark brown hair, but it usually looks black, and most people assume it is.   so we'll say i have black hair.      i have slightly tan skin.    not TAN or olive but definitely not pale, just somewhere in between.    i guess it also depends on the lighting... but from what the sun tells me, i'll go by that.      and plain brown eyes.      please suggest a color!      and if you have a certain dress that you think might look good on me, that's a sure-fire way to get 10 points.   HINTHINT.      i've got a small waist, small chest, and slightly  big hips.       i'd rather not go with the bandage style dresses, as i'm not particulary curvy, and it wouldn't be all too flattering.         I'M LOOKING FOR PROM STYLE DRESSES.   short is preferred.          if you survived that novel length question, and are still willing to answer it, THANK YOU SO MUCH.   i'll owe you forever and ever and ever, and worship you.    ... pretend.

20090309165445AAw7XJD	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Ear piercing help! For anyone who knows ANYTHING about piercings?!?	~emphasis on the HELP!~         okay, last night I tried to pierce my own ears. Very unsuccessfully, I might add. I got the washcloth, the needle, the ear studs, the ice, rubbing alcohol, and regular alcohol (for the pain). For any other person in the world this wouldn't be terribly hard, I mean I'm just piercing my earlobes, I'm not TOUCHING the cartilage! But when I poked the needle through, no matter how hard I pushed, the damn thing wouldn't go through! It just bled and made this sickening crunching sound... like trying to stick a needle through a packing peanut. I know it went through a little, because I had a hard time pulling it through, but it wouldn't go all the way, no matter how hard I twisted and shoved. Now my ears are REEEEEEALLY sore, but I still want to pierce them. Should I wait until the tiny holes I already poked are healed or should I just go for it? And How can I make sure I do it right this time?          P.S. no dipshit answers like "duhz stupidz get them dun professionally duhz" because that's not an option.       Thanks!!!!

20090309172018AAYlyMs	Beauty & Style;Hair	How often should I wash my hair, it's really frizzy then really oily... help?	Okay I wash my hair everyday right now. After I wash it in the morning it stays really really frizzy until the evening. Then it gets a little more oily as time goes on. When I wake up in the morning my hair is so oily and gross and itches like I have lice or something. So then I have to wash it so I don't scratch my head raw. I heard the more I wash it the more it produces oil because the natural oils are being stripped. I just don't think I can reduce my hair washing to every other day. It looks horrible in the morning, I have to brush it which makes it look more oily. My mom calls these types of things catch 22 or something. I can't win. I don't use heat products on my hair and I don't use a brush very often I try and use combs. I try not to use anti frizz products unless I shower and have to go somewhere important after and I need the frizz gone. Am I just one of those people who is stuck with complicated hair?

20090309174921AAFQsom	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can anyone help me find a similar dress (Please read details)?	Here's the dress I originally wanted for prom:    http://www.onlineformal.com/product/CLEA...       But here's the problem - I don't have $300 to spend on a dress.      What I want in a dress:   - a rich, dark shade of blue (sapphire, midnight, etc)   - tight around the bust/waist (no empire waist dresses)   - not too tight on lower hips/thighs (like those mermaid-style or whatever it's called ones that are tight the whole way down and then flare out at the knee... I don't look good in those at all, haha)   - go with silver shoes & jewelry      Also, I don't mind if the dress is strapless or has straps, but I don't really like the thicker straps that are on some dresses. A corset-style lace-up back would be nice, but I wouldn't mind if a dress fit all my other preferences and didn't have the corset part.       So, can anyone find a dress that is similar to the one I want, but for around $150 or less? I'll go up to $180 but I don't think I can spend any more than that.      [If it makes a difference, I'm usually a size 6-8 in dresses.]         Thanks so much! =)

20090309174707AACR52B	Beauty & Style;Hair	A good hairstyle for fine/thin hair?	I actually asked this earlier in the week, but it was at one in the morning, so hopefully I can get more feedback:      So, my hair is really fine (sometimes flat and stringy-- the photos actually don't do its stubbornness enough justice) and has always been rather difficult to find a style for, or if I find a style that could work with it, it does not go well with my face shape. Lately I have kind of just grown it out and stopped caring, though I kind of want to start styling it again.      Here are some pictures of my current hair at different angles, hopefully I don't look angry or anything in them:       http://s14.photobucket.com/albums/a331/T...        http://s14.photobucket.com/albums/a331/T...        http://s14.photobucket.com/albums/a331/T...        http://s14.photobucket.com/albums/a331/T...       I am pretty open to any length of hairstyle, though short ones would be nice since it gets really hot where I live over summer. Any pics or general tips would be appreciated-- for someone with hair like mine, I have little understanding of it, and often have difficulty finding hairstylists who can work with it.

20090309170918AAVf6XS	Beauty & Style;Hair	Need Some Perm Advice?	Ok so I really want to get a perm. I love big hair but have always had fine, thin hair. My hair is about mid length (I'll have a picture for you to use) and I have dyed it but won't anymore. The bottom of my hair is slightly different colors with the top. The type of perm I want is kinda like an afro. It's really tight. I want it to be big as well (of course). So my first question is : If my hair is mid-length, how much shorter will it look when permed so tightly. Second: Will the perm look big even though my hair isn't layered and is pretty thin, will I need extensions? three: Should I dye my hair so that it is all one color before I get one, or just live with it because it isn't that noticeable? and four: How much would all of this cost me???      Please if you're a stylist, talk me through what I need to do step by step. and I also heard that I can still straighten my hair if I get a tight perm, but it will take tons of time and tons of heat protection spray. is that true????

20090309174806AANbXrK	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Rumor about Proactiv?	I really want to order proactiv and I have seen the price tag.

Do I have to pay another 60.00 every 2 months just to have clear skin? I heard rumors that after you pay the first 59.95 they keep sending the kit to you for free every 2 months is that true?
