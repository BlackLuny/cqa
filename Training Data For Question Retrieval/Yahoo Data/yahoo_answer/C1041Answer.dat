He talks about how Jeff won't fight him but says once they both qualify, he'll finally get his hands on him. He's drawing a lot of heel heat.<br>  <br>  * MVP b. Matt Hardy to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 25.<br>  - MVP builds up a solid offense early on. Matt counters and attempts to connect with Twist of Fate. MVP reverses it to get the win via pinfall.<br>  <br>  * Jeff Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin is announced for tonight.<br>  <br>  * R-Truth b. Chavo Guerrero<br>  - Good back and forth match.

Big Show then cuts a promo saying that Edge is not a good champion and Vickie agrees. John Cena comes out and interrupts. Cena cleans house hitting Big Show with a low blow and throwing Edge into the ring post then hitting him with a table. Cena whispers something in Vickie's ear and leaves. Vickie leaves the ring in tears.<br>  <br>  * Maryse b. Eve in a non-title match<br>  - Michelle McCool joins Tazz & Jim Ross on commentary. Lots of boring chants started throughout the match.

Power shifts back and forth. According to several of our correspondents it appears as if Umaga tweaked his leg as the referee held up the "x" signal. Legacy comes out of the crowd and attacks Triple H. Randy Orton keeps teasing the punt. He stands over Triple H as this week's SmackDown goes off the air.|`|Jd1bHebRaa	I like wrestling, but don't entirely know what your talking about.

jSkHquK5aa	Except the USA and a few other countries, Soccer is the most popular sport in the world.<br>  <br>  How and why is this ball game have become so popular?<br>  <br>  The first reason is tradition – in many countries over the years, many rivalry, traditions and community relevance were raised. A lot of soccer clubs has fans with the same religion, political opinions or history. This is why for those people it is much more than a game – it is about tradition, dignity, pride, joy and glory. Those fans share happiness, disappointments, wins, loses, joy and tears, Bad times on one hand and great times from the other.<br>  <br>  Not like other ball games as basketball, Baseball, Handball etc.. Soccer has a very few highlights peak during the game. Most of the matches has between 2-3 goals, and The game could turn around sometimes in 5 minutes. That’s why Soccer seems to be more romantic than other sports.<br>  <br>  In the Major countries, especially the less developed, you can see kids from very young age play with the ball trying to score goals. You can see the passion on their eyes, and the longing to the ball. You will not see them on the street playing volleyball or Tennis.<br>  <br>  Then they grow up and share the passion with their families and children.<br>  <br>  In my onion, there is no beautiful sight in the sports world ,like a joyful crowd after a goal in a crowded big stadium. Some researches even say, the filling of a fan after his team scored a goal, is equal to an orgasm during sex.<br>  <br>  Because of the mentioned reasons and many more, Soccer is the most popular, exciting and fascinating Sport in The world.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	American football originated from association football (soccer), I'll have you know. And the English Premier league is one of the richest sporting organisations in the world. Many clubs have billionaire owners, and spend hundreds of millions of pounds on players every year. Football is the most popular sport in the world because it appeals to the widest amount of people. In other words, everybody likes it. Only Americans like their sports. That's because they're just commercial circuses which don't involve even a fraction of the skill you find in football (soccer).|`|09SjyOHkaa	are u kidding me i know loads of dominican soccer fans/players|`|irljnVkAaa	That's not the reason at all. Its popular because it was spread around the world by the British. It is the most popular sport in most of the world's riches countries, not just the poorest. Plus, the Dominican Republic is not the poorest country in the world.<br>  EDIT: The Problem is completely right.|`|j3iP5iwHaa	because stickball is and that turns into baseball and baseball rules|`|eaf82079d386f1be514388360f3d4ae2aa	uh... i've met so many dominicans that play soccer...
xxtvhn5Naa	try getting the defense with 3 DLine, 1 LB, and 7 DBs.  I don't know whats its called, but there is one play if that the DEs do a QB contain, and then the DT and one of the DBs blitz.  This defense should work because it contains the QB, and if the DEs dont get him, there is 3 or 4 DBs waiting for the QB or RB.  <br>  <br>  any QB contain would work, but i like this one because of the 7 DBs<br>  <br>  EDIT: yeah the guy above me had a good answer too, you can have be the DE and then use the right anolog stick and move it right, then go to your other DE and do the same thing.  that is the flat coverage.  that should work too|`|IgXqUytkaa	I love to blitz on that kind of plays by the offense. <br>  And if you like blitzing use either the steelers or the ravens defense.|`|28d2ee07c2da4f8c9116c55988afad58aa	To stop curls or flat routes in the offense you should try a flat zone which is the light blue colored one in the plays. This will put a defender in that area. Try a cover 3, cover 2, for this package. To stop a Vince Young type rushing qb try a spy, man qb spy if the play has the word 'spy' in it you should call it if you feel you can't stop the qb rush. This will assign one defender to mirror every move the quarterback does. Hope I helped.|`|u9Bc5kLBaa	<a href="http://ihatejasmine.com/?id=fk5oidmhyw3eri6r45updwip0b7yp4" rel="nofollow">http://ihatejasmine.com/?id=fk5oidmhyw3e...</a>
gF6pgy8raa	1. Detroit – Matt Stafford QB, Georgia <br>  - I would be very surprised if Detroit doesn't take Stafford here.<br>  2. St. Louis –Jason Smith OT, Baylor<br>  - They missed out on Jake Long last year so they go with Smith.<br>  3. KC – Aaron Curry LB, Wake Forest<br>  - Aaron Curry is simply the safest player in the draft. I could also see Brian Orakpo going here since the Chiefs had the least amount of sacks in the NFL.<br>  4. Seattle – B.J. Raji DT, BC<br>  - They need to fill the DT position after losing Rocky Bernard to FA.<br>  5. Cleveland – Brian Orakpo DE/OLB, Texas<br>  - Need someone to give more of a pass rush and Orakpo is a sack artist.<br>  6. Cincinnati – Andre Smith OT, Alabama <br>  - Even though he didn't work out at the Combine, there is no denying his talent and would fill a need at RT after losing Stacey Andrews.<br>  7. Oakland – Michael Crabtree WR, Texas Tech<br>  - Crabtree might not have the speed Al Davis loves, but they need a WR and Crabtree is available.<br>  8. Jacksonville – Eugene Monroe OT, Virginia<br>  - Monroe replaces Khalif Barnes.<br>  9. Green Bay – Everette Brown OLB/DE, FSU<br>  - After switching to the 3-4 they need a pass rusher and Brown is there. <br>  10. SF – Mark Sanchez QB, USC<br>  - I really don't know what the 49ers will do, but Singletary has said that neither Shaun Hill or Alex Smith are the answer so Sanchez gets the nod.|`|xFfskbjYaa	1 Detroit Lions Matthew Stafford QB    <br>  Think they should stay with Culpepper...but they prolly don't.<br>  <br>  2 St. Louis Rams Jason Smith OL<br>  Need a line.<br>  <br>  3 Kansas City Chiefs Aaron Curry LB<br>  With Vrabel and Curry, they may get some sacks!<br>  <br>  4 Seattle Seahawks Mark Sanchez QB<br>  Hasselback's injured often and not getting any younger, Housh needs a QB.

Besides they need someone to sling it to johnson.<br>  2.Rams-  Jason Smith- He's climbed up the draft boards, so i think hes the first OL in the draft. Also the rams desperately need a lineman anyway.<br>  3.Chiefs- WR Michael Crabtree- Crabtree is a beast. He can break any tackle in open field and is a huge target. I doubt the chiefs let him slip by. They really need to electrify this offense and this give a great target for Matt Cassel.<br>  4.Seahawks- Aaron Currey- the seahawks get lucky as aaron currey falls in there lap. This is a perfect choice for the seahawks.<br>  5.Browns- Malcom Jenkins- Browns need some secondary help. They can move the ball however they can't prevent others from moving the ball.<br>  6.Bengals- Jeremy Maclin- They lost T.J. Hoz and might lose Chad from a trade they need a Wide Reciever if thats the case.<br>  7.Raiders-  Eugene Monroe- Al Davis finally relizing you need an OL to be sucessfull. So he finally drafts a lineman.<br>  8.Jaguars-  Bj Raji- The jags got want to stuff the run so how do they get? A run stuffer.<br>  9. Packers-  Rey Mauluga- Packers are swithing to a 3-4 so they go with a middle linebacker to fill the 2nd middle linebacker possibly 1st.<br>  10.49ers Mark Sanchez- They need a quarterback alex smith is gone and nobody really left for them to grab.|`|wd7XuvKnaa	1.Lions- QB Matt Stafford (UGA)<br>  2.Rams- OT Jason Smith (Baylor)<br>  3.Chiefs- LB Aaron Curry (Wake Forrest)<br>  4.Seahawks- WR Michael Crabtree (TTU)<br>  5.Browns- DE Brian Orkapo (Texas)<br>  6.Bengals- CB Malcolm Jenkins (OSU)<br>  7.Raiders- OT Eugene Monroe (Virginia)<br>  8.Jaguars- CB Vontae Davis (Illinois)<br>  9.

AA12037424	It was named ater John W. Heisman who was a great "old time" coach from the 1890's until the 1920's at several institutions, most prominently at Georgia Tech. He was never a professional player, but he is in the College Hall of Fame as a coach. He was the Georgia Tech coach when they scored the most points in any single game in college football history when just before World War I, they beat Cumberland (Tenn.) 222-0! He was known as an innovator, creating the snap from center and helping to legalize and redefine the forward pass.|`|4f7182785e5cfbd2b0394f0cd33ed74caa	The Heisman Memorial Trophy Award (also known simply as the Heisman Trophy or The Heisman), named after former college football player and coach John W. Heisman, is considered the most prestigious award in American college football. It is awarded annually before the postseason bowl games.<br>  <br>  The prestige in the award stems from a number of factors. Though balloting is open for all football players in all divisions of college, the winners usually represent Division I-A schools. In addition to incredible personal stats, team achievements play a heavy role in the voting - a typical Heisman winner represents a team that had an outstanding season and is most likely in contention for a DI-A national championship. Further prestige is granted by experience - no freshmen or sophomores have ever won the award, and only a few juniors have held the bronze trophy; the rest have been seniors. Finally, the Heisman is almost always awarded to a running back or a quarterback; very few players have won the trophy playing at a different position.<br>  <br>  Balloting for the Heisman is selective. The fifty states of the USA are split into six regions, and six regional Representatives are selected to appoint voters in their states (the regions include the Far West, the Mid Atlantic, Mid West, North East, South, and South West). Each region has 145 media votes, for a total of 870 votes. In addition, all previous Heisman winners still alive may vote, and one final vote is counted through public balloting. The Heisman ballots contain a 3-2-1 point system, in which each ballot ranks the voter's top three players and awards them three points for a first-place vote, two points for a second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The points are tabulated, and the player with the highest total of points across all ballots wins the Heisman Trophy.<br>  <br>  The trophy serves in part as a representation of a collegiate player's chances in professional leagues, such as the NFL (to which many Heisman winners go after their collegiate careers). Most Heisman winners have amazingly high stock, and are considered among the absolute best players available on draft day on any given year.<br>  <br>  The award was first presented in 1935 by the Downtown Athletic Club in Manhattan, New York, a privately owned recreation facility near the site of the former World Trade Center. The Club was forced to close its doors in 2002 due, in part, to financial troubles resulting from the 9/11 attacks. The award ceremony is now hosted by the Yale Club in Manhattan, and as of 2005 was being held at the Nokia Theatre. The award is presented independently from the annual College Football Awards (where most other related awards are presented).<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Heisman Award winners <br>  2 Trivia <br>  2.1 Winners by school <br>  3 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Heisman Award winners<br>  Highlighting indicates players that were also the first overall selection in the National Football League Draft.<br>  <br>  Year Winner School Position <br>  1935 Jay Berwanger Chicago Halfback <br>  1936 Larry Kelley Yale End <br>  1937 Clint Frank Yale Halfback <br>  1938 Davey O'Brien TCU Quarterback <br>  1939 Nile Kinnick Iowa Halfback <br>  1940 Tom Harmon Michigan Halfback <br>  1941 Bruce Smith Minnesota Halfback <br>  1942 Frank Sinkwich Georgia Halfback <br>  1943 Angelo Bertelli Notre Dame Quarterback <br>  1944 Les Horvath Ohio State Quarterback/Halfback <br>  1945 Doc Blanchard Army Fullback <br>  1946 Glenn Davis Army Halfback <br>  1947 Johnny Lujack Notre Dame Quarterback <br>  1948 Doak Walker SMU Halfback <br>  1949 Leon Hart Notre Dame End <br>  1950 Vic Janowicz Ohio State Halfback <br>  1951 Dick Kazmaier Princeton Halfback <br>  1952 Billy Vessels Oklahoma Halfback <br>  1953 Johnny Lattner Notre Dame Halfback <br>  1954 Alan Ameche Wisconsin Fullback <br>  1955 Howard "Hopalong" Cassady Ohio State Halfback <br>  1956 Paul Hornung Notre Dame Quarterback <br>  1957 John David Crow Texas A&M Halfback <br>  1958 Pete Dawkins Army Halfback <br>  1959 Billy Cannon LSU Halfback <br>  1960 Joe Bellino Navy Halfback <br>  1961 Ernie Davis Syracuse Halfback <br>  1962 Terry Baker Oregon State Quarterback <br>  1963 Roger Staubach Navy Quarterback <br>  1964 John Huarte Notre Dame Quarterback <br>  1965 Mike Garrett USC Halfback <br>  1966 Steve Spurrier Florida Quarterback <br>  1967 Gary Beban UCLA Quarterback <br>  1968 O.

He never played professional football for any team. <br>  The trophy itself is modeled after Ed Smith a leading player in 1934 for the now defunct New York University football team. The trophy is made out of cast bronze. <br>  Only one player, Archie Griffin, a running back for Ohio State, has won two Heisman Trophies; he did so in 1974 and 1975. <br>  The first junior to win the award was Doc Blanchard ("Mr. Inside") for Army in 1945; though he played the next year, he missed two games with injury and his teammate Glenn Davis ("Mr. Outside") won. <br>  Only two high schools have graduated multiple alumni who would eventually win the Heisman Trophy. Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California produced John Huarte (Notre Dame) and Matt Leinart (USC), most recently, but Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Texas produced the first combo with Davey O'Brien (TCU) and Tim Brown (Notre Dame). <br>  Charles Woodson is the only primarily defensive player to win the award, doing so as a defensive back for the University of Michigan in 1997. He returned kickoffs and punts during that season as well, and occasionally took plays on offense. <br>  In 2004, Helix High School became the first school to have two ex-pupils (Alex Smith and Reggie Bush) as simultaneous top five finalists. <br>  Both USC and Notre Dame are tied for 7 Heisman winners. However, in the last 40 years, Notre Dame has only had one winner, Tim Brown in 1987. All of the Trojan Heisman winners have been in the last 40 years, including three in four years between 2002 and 2005 (considered an unprecedented feat in college football). <br>  In 2005, winning the Heisman, Reggie Bush collected 2,541 out of a possible 2,769 points for a record percentage of 91.7%. That percentage bested the previous record of 85.2% by Ricky Williams in 1998. However, of the 784 first-place vote total, Bush is second to the first-place vote total of 855 in 1968 by USC running back, O.J. Simpson, and Bush's margin of victory of 933 points was 17th among Heisman winners. Also a Heisman record in 2005, Reggie Bush was first in all 6 regions and appeared on 99% of the ballots. <br>  Position Winners <br>  Halfback or Running Back 41 <br>  Quarterback 22 <br>  Fullback 2 <br>  End 2 <br>  Wide Receiver 2 <br>  Quarterback/Halfback 1 <br>  Defensive Back 1 <br>  [edit]<br>  Winners by school<br>  School Winners <br>  Notre Dame 7 <br>  USC 7 <br>  Ohio State 6 <br>  Oklahoma 4 <br>  Army 3 <br>  Michigan 3 <br>  Nebraska 3 <br>  Auburn 2 <br>  Florida 2 <br>  Florida State 2 <br>  Georgia 2 <br>  Miami 2 <br>  Navy 2 <br>  Texas 2 <br>  Wisconsin 2 <br>  Yale 2 <br>  BYU 1 <br>  Boston College 1 <br>  Colorado 1 <br>  Chicago 1 <br>  Houston 1 <br>  Iowa 1 <br>  LSU 1 <br>  Minnesota 1 <br>  Oklahoma State 1 <br>  Oregon State 1 <br>  Penn State 1 <br>  Pittsburgh 1 <br>  Princeton 1 <br>  South Carolina 1 <br>  SMU 1 <br>  Stanford 1 <br>  Syracuse 1 <br>  Texas A&M 1 <br>  TCU 1 <br>  UCLA 1|`|AA10231417	is a trophy awardd annually to the outstanding clooege football player in united states.The trophy was first  awarded in 1935,it was named for John W heisman,a leadind football coach ata number of colleges from 1892-1927.He helped revvolunition the rules and strtegy of football.Foe example he introduced the center snap and led the legalize the forward pass.Hiesman rtophy winners apperas in the World Book article on Football{College Football.|`|AA11918170	It's named after somebody named Heisman!|`|AA11493273	It is named after Coach Heisman.

3dcf9bc6c0d51baeea4a9fdb1a2012e5aa	if your talking about the 81 points that Kobe scored... which i think you are... then it wasnt the highest ever... Wilt Chamberlain set a National Basketball Association scoring record of 100 points as the Philadelphia Warriors defeated the New York Knickerbockers, 169-147. The combined score was an association record too in 1962.. and Kobe did it once already im sure he could do it again and beat it or someone else will..|`|3a7f4f647586bcc40965ffe7842aadafaa	kobe bryant|`|ec9f57769588a5e337195176afcd54a6aa	If you have the right combination of a great player playing against a bad team, it could happen. Kobe dropped 81 on a Raptors team that didn't even bother to guard him, and Wilt scored 100 against a Knick team that simply couldn't stop him. So get the right combination of great player/out-classed opponent, 81 points could happen again. Shoot, 100 points could happen again. Just don't see it happening anytime soon. It was 44 years between Wilt and Kobe. With improved defenses and teams having long enough memories to do all they can not be the next team to get embarrassed, I wouldn't be surprised if it a similar feat didn't happen again for at least another 20 years.|`|06f10328d9128ee5eb14a34250c460e2aa	Yes, Wilt Chamberlin still holds the record.

AA11318022	Hola!<br>  Los directivos de la Juve compraron árbitros. Ahora, no sólo con dinero ni ofreciendo cosas. En algunos casos se ha descubierto que simplemente los amenazaron e incluso utilizaron herramientas como el secuestro para forzarlos.<br>  Realmente, las razones son difíciles de saber. La Juve tiene (o al menos tenía) varios de los mejores jugadores de Italia y no necesitaba llegar a estos extremos para ganar. De hecho, personalmente, no creo que hayan ganado por estas cosas, creo que ganaron por los jugadores que tienen. Lo peor es que los jugadores son los que salieron más afectados con todo esto y son los que menos tuvieron que ver (aunque, según entiendo, agarraron también a Buffon apostando en contra del equipo... te podrás imaginar)<br>  <br>  Investigadores descubrieron llamadas donde se evidenciaban los actos de los directivos e iniciaron una investigación y así se desarrolló la cosa.<br>  La cuestión es que la Juve fue la más afectada de todos los equipos evidenciados y eso es lo que no parece justo, porque todos habían cometido actos similares. Y ahora la Juve es la única en Serie B... parece que ahí entraron otros factores más "políticos" (por ejemplo, el hecho de que Berlusconi, el ex-primer ministro italiano, es el due?o del Milan, por ejemplo).<br>  <br>  Actualmente el problema de ha empeorado porque, después de haber apelado la decisión de la FIFA ante varias instancias deportivas, la Juve ha declarado que irá a una corte civil (una corte normal, por así decirlo). El reglamento de la FIFA dice que las cosas deportivas se deben tratar en los tribunales deportivos, porque si no se les quita validez a sus decisiones... Por eso, ante el comentario de la Juve la FIFA a amenazarlo con excluir al equipo de la federación y evitar que jugue en cualquier campeonato internacional (no sólo a la Juve de hecho, sino a los demás equipos italianos e incluso a la misma selección nacional)... Como ves la cosa es complicada y no termina.<br>  Pero ese es el resúmen que te puedo dar.<br>  <br>  éxito!|`|08f9bc1a9d2c0ef501ee5eb5f9c39396aa	Compraron lo partido y a los arbitros y por eso fueron campeones|`|1cb9d702d4d037896fd95d127b67ef6faa	Al ser tan ignorantes. Juve tenia un equipo para ganar la liga. Pero los dirigentes no pensaron asi y como este mundo se maneja con dinero sobornaron arbitros, compraron partidos, compraron jugadores ilicitos y una larga lista. Tiene suerte de q no hayan echado al equipo. Y en mi opinion el tema de q haya quedado en la B y con pocos puntos en contra, tuvo q ver con el dinero o el prestigio del club, a otro club le hubiera costado mas caro|`|e32d1313118d35c38f42f06dca0aac7faa	Esta pregunta ya se habia hecho con antelación, sin embargo estoy dispuesto a responder:<br>  <br>  Resulta que la Vecchia Signora estuvo involucrada en la compra de arbitros(entre ellos De Sanctis, que sí lo llegue a ver pitar algunos partidos), el arreglo de partidos decisivos, la compra de jugadores, uno de los reponsables de esto fue el nefasto Luciano Moggi, uno de los directivos unvolucrados, junto con su hijo, fueron participers de este gran escandalo ahora la FIFA ya dijo que suspenderia a equipos italianos de competencias internacionales si la Juve recurria a estancias federales dado que la última apelación de esta per non descender a la Serie B fue rechazada, y claro con esto, la ida de grandes giocatori, Thuram, Zambrotta, Ibrahimovic, Cannavaro, Viera, y uno que esta si se va o no es Camoranesi, quienes al menos han expresado su apoyo a este equipo han sido Del Piero, Buffon y Nedved.<br>  <br>  Punto.|`|16810ac47a9cd0f8ca91a2d7bc747990aa	Te cuento... compro arbitros para no perder partidos claves, presiono a jugadores de otros equipos, se unio a las barras bravas, la lista sigue, no se portaron nada bien, demasiado que no los excluyeron de la liga.|`|b8db7097989546474d6510248751a614aa	Compraba arbitros, partidos, jugadores rivales, solo le falto comprar hinchada y a la FIFA para que no los castiguen|`|2a79db318d5d514c5a40ffbe63554450aa	pues nada mas no tuvo los suficientes recursos futbolísticos para poder ganar los partidos importantes, y opto por comprar a los árbitros,? cres que es motivo suficiente para desenderlo de división?? claro que si........|`|480e789a20dd9436578bb1925e4880d9aa	Hicieron trampa, compraron varios partidos.|`|7685561e1296156fd0954071f2acba9baa	Simplemente trampa....... y tuvo su castigo.Suerte|`|c06fd19652b9590ea219e8f4fb56d58caa	Lo que hicieron los directivos fue comprar árbitros, arreglar partidos, aliarse con los barrabrava para ejercer presión.<br>   En suma de todo un poco, lo que es sumamente lamentable porque jugadores les sobraban para obtener todos los campeonatos que se les ocurrieran.<br>   El castigo está perfecto, vas a ver que de ahora en adelante no van tratar de hacer lo mismo, y si lo hacen van presos todos.

Drew Gooden has lost his mind. He does not, in any way, shape, or fashion deserve $60 MILLION DOLLARS. He believes he is worth superstar money, and he is far from Iverson, Bryant, O'Neal, Wade, and L James. He will go to other teams & they will laugh at him. If he finds someone crazy enough to think he is worth $60 million, let him go or sign and trade, but I think he will end up signing for someone for approximately $4 million/year.|`|2cbc4b01e7ea558aeda21ae271c525edaa	drew gooden isnt worth 60million. first of all, i think gooden has already reached his full potential. he is an undersized power forward, he is generously listed at 6-10 but he is at most 6-8. he averaged 10 pts last year, a far cry from the 14 pts the previous year. i cant see his game improving any time soon. his ballhandling skills need help badly, and he cant post up anybody. he needs to play with lots of energy and aggressiveness to offset his lack of size at the 4 spot. <br>  <br>  he claims he deserves the contract that nene got, well i think not coz nene is as athletic if not more athletic than gooden, runs the floor very well, but nene also has a wider body and a longer wingspan, very important for a physical presence down low. he is taller and stronger than gooden, and he has a lot more potential, which was i think what made denver offer that contract. <br>  <br>  so with all that said, gooden needs to face reality and realize that his price tag would be more in the range of say an udonis haslem, a tweener just like him...

He has the youthful energy, but has had enough experience to not do anything stupid.  I thought he was around 26, but then I found out he is only 22.  22!  He could become Germany's next big star, not only with the National Team, but perhaps helping Bayern Munich to the European's Champions Cup or UEFA Cup Finale.  Also, it is not possible to place the ball better than how he did on that goal.  I mean, forget in the top corner, he put it in off the post and no more than maybe 2 inches under the crossbar.  Absolutely PHENOMONAL!!|`|4122d28997a90e8004193c8d8bc627a8aa	I think he's awesome! probably my fav player at the moment|`|9f7e72e9ba1111771cc5252899d3eca5aa	excellent|`|AA11547857	Philipp Lahm: he is not only an awesome defender, he's a very fine looking man. And especially after performing so well this World Cup he's gained a lot of respect from lots of people for playing such classy football, and for being such a classy player in terms of behavious and skill on the pitch. And of course, what a way to begin the goal tally of this WC! What a goal! It should win the best goal award!
d2b50bd365da661e5b64b449a814b5c8aa	I had this rule used against a team that I coached. In that game there was 15 minutes before the time limit. They told me that an inning couldn't be started if there was not enough time to complete at least a half inning. Stupid!! I think|`|AA10137828	There are no time limits in LL sanctioned games.<br>  <br>  The time limits will be by "local adoption". <br>  <br>  Most time limits are of the "no new inning after......" type. There are also "drop-Dead" limits which are usually used for scrimmage, or non-standing games. When time runs out in a drop dead, it's over. In the no new inning type, you must remember that a new inning begins IMMEDIATLEY after the third out is made in the previous inning. If the home team (bottom half of inning) is put out and there is one second left on the clock, the next inning starts and must be played out.<br>  <br>  The 5 minute rule you were told may have been implemented by the local league, or tournament. That is not a well thought out ruling. In 5 minutes or less, the either team can score a tying run, or go ahead. Using the "Well, there ain't enough time left" theory is taking the game away from the kids. Might as well just play til the umpire says "that's enough!"  The no new inning is the best way, but play 6, 7, or 9 innings is even better. Check with your league organizers and see if that rule is in writing somewhere, or just an on field invention,<br>  <br>  As for the shorthanded rule, LL rules follow OBR rules, (Official Baseball Rules), there are many addendums to fit the playing ages, but you do have to have 9 uniformed, rostered players to start or continue a game.|`|b86e6505e8c2820c569929766443e26faa	For a MAJORS game, no time limit is allowed.  Ever - regular season or tournament.  Unfortunately a lot of local leagues like to tinker with the rules.  But to do this in a tournament shows a complete disregard for the rules.  Is this a local tournament, or is this part of the Williamsport Tournament?<br>  <br>  The 8 players issue - that is OBR, so that should be enforced.|`|cd89e892c54806e7f114f3edbcf50adfaa	the rules is that a new inning cannot be started AFTER a given time. i don't know what that 5 minute crap is, but i know from personal experience that the rule is that you can't start a new inning after a given time.

9c67948e2f8b55464ca4a8d29f774612aa	Have a positive attitude.  If your skills are on the level with the other kids--then what's going to make the difference is your attitude.  Your coach wants people on the team that have their head in the game, are team players and are having fun.  Cheer on the other girls when they do well.  If you mess-up, shake it off and keep going.  No one likes a sore loser or someone who pitches a fit when something goes wrong.    Remember, it's not you against them (ok--so maybe it is) but make it easy for the coach to see you as part of the team.  Keep your chin up.  If you go out to have fun and try hard and make it, that's terrific.  But even if you don't make it, you know that you did the best you could.  And now you're free to find something else that you enjoy like photography classes or yearbook, lacrosse or even an afterschool job.

If they get Texas, they may have a chance to win as the underdog.  Just like when Texas, with James Brown at QB, beat the Huskers when the Huskers were huge favorites.  That would be ironic.|`|eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	They WILL lose next week to Texas A&M. My thoughts are they wont get the TROPHY or go to a BCS game.

ccefa9b5118dd266c8fe09f017536337aa	I think that at 3-3 the Cowboys should have stuck with Bledsoe.  He may not have the mobility, but you have to remember that new QBs don't know the recievers as well and Romo may well lose a few before he gets to know the recievers (He may lose 2 or 3 games, and the Cowboys can't afford that) Plus, making such a dramatic change will shake the rest of the team and throw them off.  Romo may well be a decent QB, but the Cowboys can't afford to give him a learning curve.  Plus, he did pretty crappy against the Giants.  If he screws this up, the Cowboys can't really switch back.  I think Parcells took a big risk and may have made a really bad mistake.  Better to stick with the  experianced QB.  Also, Parcells REALLY f***ed up by Putting Romo in for the 2nd half.  There was no way Romo could have won that game.  Parcells is losing his touch if he thought that that was a good idea.  Better to have let Bledsoe have a few more games to prove himself before benching him.  They are .500 now, but if Romo plays the way he played in the Giants game, the Cowboys are screwed.  So even if Romo is a decent player, Parcells made a huge mistake in my opinion.|`|35f0767753729f9b0fe024ff7622cb28aa	its romo's chance to shine|`|21325d2f9176d4c473ebb339fa1c92bfaa	i like Romo i think he would improve with playin time|`|2f6f21640ce35a19621b20f0a3a05c28aa	You are right.  The problem is that Bledsoe was getting hit pretty bad, and he is not a very mobile quaterback.  I don't think that Romo sucks, but he is just a rookie and he lacks experience.  But, eventually he will come to his peak preformance soon.|`|4cccfe92b8b4dbfdac1ef792a02e9df0aa	I believe Romo is a good quarterback, but he should NOT have been placed in a situation like that. You do NOT put a QB that has barely played in the NFL in the 2nd half in that situation. However, Bledsoe has TWICE thrown an interception while in the red zone.<br>  <br>  The problem is Bledsoe should have been let go a while ago. WHY DIDN'T THEY GO AFTER BREES? We all know Bledsoe is a freakin' statue back there. Put him in shotgun. As slow as he is, by the time he drops back, a DE is already back there waiting for him. The offensive line was attrocious as well today.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, this season is lost if they don't figure out what to do IMMEDIATELY...|`|c1f486046450d139713d0cf2b95d59ffaa	i think parcels prematurely substituted, shoulda stuck with bledsoe

04367c95bc89edaef63b44df7e3a08a7aa	YES!<br>  <br>  But it is not only overly competitive parents. It is the amount of time necessary to participate in team sports. Frankly, I am not willing for my child to devote every second of what little spare time they have between school and homework to an overly competitive team sport.<br>  <br>  I find fencing a much better choice for us for several reasons. It very athletic and can be highly competitive if you want. However, you can also just fence for fun if you want. There is no "team" relying on you to make every practice, and no nutcase parents who get pissed if your kid has a bad day. Further, since it is mostly a one on one sport everyone who participates in a tournament will get to fence the same amount of pool bouts as well as however many direct elimination bouts it takes.|`|fcb4cfcafe0e060ea9d6854b6e75697aaa	It's not the sports.

74cd39683ed52c8604716c88c5bfc309aa	NO way an undefeated Rutgers would wind up #1 or 2 in the final bcs poll, because of their weaker schedule than stronger conference teams. <br>  What impressive non conf teams did they beat?<br>  Plus, they play in the weakest by far of the bcs conferences. <br>  I believe even a 2 loss team from the SEC or Pac 10 could finish ahead of an undefeated Rutgers in the final bcs poll|`|0995d23ff0d0176382c3f24933ca13e3aa	Rutgers is not ranked high enough now to make it to the NC game. Louisville, about to ranked 3rd or 4th, has a shot, but the more likely scenario will be Florida, about to be 3rd or 4th or Auburn, about to be 5th, IF they win the rest of their games. Louisville doesn't have the strength of schedule to hold on to the #3 spot without some help, I'm betting.<br>  <br>  Complicating things is Arkansas. The hogs are higher ranked in the SEC west now because of their upset of Auburn. If Arkansas wins the west, they (and not Auburn) will play Florida for the SEC championship. Then Florida still has a chance at the NCG but Arkansas will probably be ranked too low to have a shot.|`|2325e64bc2f167ea56f41cacab01df81aa	The Rutgers will never play for the BCS because it all depends on the BCS points.  They have had a cake schedule to get undefeated.  If they beat louisville it wouldn't help much.  You've to have a killer schedule.|`|AA10380060	Unfortunately for Rutgers no they will not play in the NC no matter if they win the rest of their games 105-0 for the rest of the year, the BCS is half-way decided at the beginning of the season and if you start out anywhere less than 20th in the nation you might as well forget about being in the big game. Yes they do play the favoritism game, last week USC who was the no. 3 team in the nation was beaten by 3-4 (going into the game) Oregon State and not to insult all the Beaver fans out there but OS is about as dominating as Richard Simmons in a IFBB body building contest, but USC dropped to only 9th!!! So despite that loss they will still weasel their way into one of the big bowls, while some undefeateds will have the "honor" of playing in the Chik-Fila Peach Bowl or idk even the 2000 Flushes Toliet Bowl against some unranked 7-5 team that has not won a meaningful game since Bea Arthur was a teenager. Yes the Big East is a BCS conference but have been under alot of unfair fire since the departing of Miami (who is unranked), VT (is only 23), and Boston College (16th but lost to 3-5 NC State and beat Maine...WOW, I'm impressed-NOT) who were all in the Big East when the BCS was conceived. No playoff equals controversy, always has always will. And before anyone out there opens their mouth I will pre-address their ignorance, in the NFL only a very few teams who had the best or 2nd best record in the regular season won the Super Bowl, as an example last year's SB winner Pittsburgh was the number 6 seed in the AFC playoffs and would have been ranked 11th between both conferences. Hey I love the EA Sports football games as much as anyone but computers should not decide championships OR who plays for them.|`|AA11284713	Ok to answer your question.<br>  <br>  Rutgers runs the table to finish undefeated beating along the way Louisville, and WVa.  Louisville assuming its their only loss is likely to remain in the top 10, and if WVa only has 2 losses they remain top 20.  Rutgers Strength of Schedule goes up from those two games into the 70s where Louisvilles is right now and it boosts their computer rankings, and possible gets them voted into the top ten by the human pollsters as well.  If some of the other one loss teams lose a game during that time as well Rutgers will more than likely get the nod.  <br>  <br>  SEC fans if Arkansas gets one loss in the SEC to lets say LSU, they still get to go to the SEC title game, and if they win it do you really think a one loss team that didnt win the conference is going to go to the title game.  Auburn is out of the title hunt, barring a total meltdown of Arkansas during the last few weeks.  Florida loses one more game they are out of the title hunt.  I dont see that many one loss teams remaining by the end of the season anyways so if Rutgers goes undefeated they will jump a lot of those teams in the computer polls, and get more votes in the AP as well.|`|db3ebbc7e9e0addfede55d6a3af25c85aa	You would have a better chance of seeing God the Rutgers going to the National Championship game.|`|AA12061616	AGAIN, YOU ARE CRYING OVER YOUR WEAK TEXAS TEAM!!!! JUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOUR TEAM IS NOT 2ND AND NEVER WILL BE THIS YEAR.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that I am not the one saying that Arkansas is a National Championship team. I am able to admit we got killed by USC....big deal. We took a loss and now we are 8-1. Why are you so worried about the polls? I have come to the conclusion that Arkansas is never going to get any respect, and that is fine. Sports analysts are already putting Auburn as the SEC west champs, while giving no consideration to Arkansas. Don't let where you are ranked in the polls because it really doesn't matter. The BCS is a crock of ****.

I too, think he is a great back but people who vote don't understand how tough the MAC conference is and will look past his big day against Ohio St because the game was never really close. For him to have had a real chance at the Heisman his team would have to be unbeaten with a win over a "BCS" foe or have 1 loss with that being a close game to OSU.|`|2e040ee8d20979ba052108c984af80edaa	He's a poser not a champion.|`|AA11802214	Garrett Wolfe plays against schools who would lose to the local community colleges..

It was so cold in San Diego today (something that doesn't happen very often) and there might have been ice on the ground (ok, not an excuse).  Think Marty will stick around next season?

The guards are right next to the center.  The defensive tackles are next to the guards.

AA12138593	when the team commits 9 penalties and cannot run the ball consistently it doesn't matter who the QB is. If you force your team into a 1 and 20 or 3 and 7 the defense knows you will pass and your QB will not be successful, whether its romo, bledsoe or unitas, and no romo is not better than bledsoe, but he is more mobile which would be useful if the o-line did a poor blocking job, but the pass blocking was fine. Romo has a weaker arm, less experience and has not yet shown decision making or play-making ability|`|2a4b74139c38f025720894b5e336fc42aa	Bledsoe is great when you're trying to build...but once you have all the other pieces in place, it becomes painfully obvious how inadequate he truly is.

AA12061683	Depends on the playing level. When my son was 10 and 11, he wore the same cleats for soccer and football. Now he's a little older, stronger, faster and needs the extra support and protection offered by football cleats. Soccer cleats don't protect or support the ankles.|`|0995d23ff0d0176382c3f24933ca13e3aa	Most likely. I'm sure different leagues have different rules, but like football cleats, soccer cleats are plastic and not very sharp. I have personally bought soccer cleats for my son because they were the best looking cleats on the shelf. That said, however, if you play on artificial turf, you will need a different cleat than if you play on grass and you need to consider what type of traction the cleat pattern is likely to give. Some soccer cleats have cleats that are too broad, in my opinion, to be good in football. In football, you definitely want a cleat that sinks into the turf well.<br>  <br>  RE: Bad Pookie's post - if the player is older and stronger, than you may need to consider the high-top style football cleat if they have weaker ankles, but I never wore them much, even in HS or as an adult playing rec-league stuff. I think most pros use tape on their ankles rather than high-tops.|`|13d2160bf5e2dee45e4dc8a05b79d27baa	correct me if i'm wrong here, but in professional football (nfl), dont all players wear the exact same cleats?|`|fcb4cfcafe0e060ea9d6854b6e75697aaa	I thought soccer players wore ballet slippers?

The Coaches Poll, which is an annoymous coach vote for the top 25 teams. The Harris Poll, which is an annoymous vote cast by 130 or so former coaches, writers, atheletic directors, etc that rank the top 25 teams. Then the BCS computers there are 7 computers that rank the top 25 teams in the nation. the highest & lowest scores are thrown out and then the computer scores are averaged and divided by a perfect score1.0000 to determine the computer score. Then the Computer, the Harris and Coaches Poll are averaged to find the BCS ranking of the top 25 teams. And the top 2 play in the national championship game. while the other BCS bowl matchups are selected by a committee. <br>  <br>  Let me know if you need any other info!|`|a04ab4e46302b268101c410a5a129c0baa	Well they take into consideration how many people like a team, how good it would be for the NCAA for that team to have a shot at a national championship, how much they can make off the particular team, and how easy it will be to justify their choices. Then they try to make sure that everyone in that teams way has a hard time winning. Then by the end of the year most of the time the team picked #1 in the preseason polls plays one of the other teams in the preseason top five for the championship

AA11109549	There is a lot that goes into answering this question!  I will explain it from the perspective of one conference and in conjunction with Boise ST.<br>  <br>  The Western Athletic Conference (WAC) has three guaranteed bowl tie-ins.  That means that if three teams from the WAC are bowl eligible (win 6 games) they are guaranteed a bowl game.  The three WAC bowl games are MPC Computer Bowl (WAC 1 Vs ACC), Sheraton Hawaii Bowl (WAC 2 vs PAC 10) and New Mexico Bowl (WAC 3 vs MWC).  So this year, Boise ST won the WAC with a 12-0 record and was 8th in the BCS standings.  I will get back to this in a second.  Hawaii was 11-2, Nevada was 8-4 and San Jose ST was 8-4.  Since Boise ST was 8th in the BCS, they were guaranteed a spot in on of the BCS bowls by finishing 8th in the BCS standings.  This left Hawaii in the Hawaii bowl because there is a by-law in the Hawaii bowl contract that if Hawaii is bowl eligible, they can be invited to the Hawaii bowl.  Nevada went to the MPC Computers Bowl and San Jose ST went to the New Mexico bowl.<br>  <br>  Now the WAC 1, 2, 3, designations for the bowl do not always hold true to actual WAC standings.  As I mentioned, Hawaii was the highest WAC team after Boise ST but they did not go to the MPC computers Bowl because of the Hawaii bowl by-laws.  Also San Jose St could have gone to the MPC Computers Bowl.  Basically, the WAC Commissioner and executives can look at all of the bowl eligible teams and decide the right team for the right bowl.  They felt the New Mexico Bowl was a better fit for SJSU then the MPC computers bowl so they sent them there.  Also on that note, in the Mountain West Conference, New Mexico was chosen over Wyoming for the New Mexico bowl, even though both teams had identical records AND Wyoming beat New Mexico.  Obviously New Mexico would be a better draw then Wyoming, so Wyoming was left in the cold with no bowl even though they were bowl eligible..<br>  <br>  There are also At-Large bowl bids that can be given out.  For example, the Poinsettia Bowl had an at-large bid that they were thinking of extending to SJSU.  The contract stated that they could not take a 6 win team over an eligible 7 win team, so once SJSU had 7 wins, they could have gone to that bowl if they didn’t go to one of the WAC bowls!<br>  <br>  In conclusion, its all about making money and conference bowl tie-ins!  You want to finish as high as you can in your conference to increase your chances of going to a bowl and not ending up like Wyoming!|`|80042f26ca57b697f7f5faafb4dda52baa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$...|`|AA10341534	BCS bowls are determined by BCS ranking for the most of them except for the rose bowl is Big Ten vs. Pac-10, Sugar is BCS vs. BCS, N'tl champ game is BCS 1 vs. BCS 2, and the Orange is BCS vs. ACC, Fiesta is BCS vs. BCS, *note that no more than 2 teams from each conference can be in a BCS game.<br>  Now for the rest, each team is picked by the bowl commitee of each bowl game.  Now as you know some of these bowls consist of stronger teams and weaker teams.  For example though, the Capital One Bowl had the first choice of taking a team from the SEC and Big Ten besides BCS teams.  therefore eliminating Florida, LSU, OSU, and Michigan.  They took Wisconsin and Arkansas.  But in a weaker game like the let's say Las Vegas Bowl, the commitee gets the 4th choice from the Pac-10 and the 1st Mountain West.  if you're still confused aim at salted mail|`|fcb4cfcafe0e060ea9d6854b6e75697aaa	It's all about the money, it doesn't get any simpler then that.

It is really hard to blame him for undisciplined play by his players, and the flagrant drops by some of his receivers. He'll probably get his last year, and he will have to to produce or else.

c6q3EERdaa	It's strange to see him turn down a contract worth $45 million. I'd take that in a heartbeat, even for 2 years. I'm not sure what Manny is thinking. The Dodgers are the only team willing to go after him for the money he wants. If Manny keeps this up, he may not have a job come Opening Day. Manny and the Dodgers need each other for their own reasons.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yeah, apparantly he does.  I mean, he's offered a deal to become the second highest player in baseball, and he's not happy with it.  The thing is that he's not going to get what he wants, from any team, seeing as the Dodgers are getting smart and deciding not to bid against themselves, and no other team is even close to what they offered, so his options are to take the Dodgers offer or not play.  Manny is all about the money, and he'll eventually take the money rather than not play and get no money at all.|`|KTp27Fokaa	lmao the Red Sox traded Manny...<br>  <br>  EDIT- I didn't really like the move.

KSSyaEWpaa	Actually they are very similar in terms of the amount of commitment needed, and the physical and mental toughness required.  Both sports have different weight divisions, which you have to work to lose weight to make.  You need a tremendous amount of wind and endurance for both.  You also need speed and skill.  Both sports require you to learn to use your body in a different way, in terms of shifting your weight, etc. <br>  <br>  Both sports require constant movement and action. In wrestling you have three periods of 2 minutes each, with no real break in between.  Amateur boxing has three, 3 minute rounds, with a one minute break in between rounds. <br>  <br>  When you box you go to bed with headaches from sparring.  These are sometimes mild concussions.  You can also get your nose busted easily in boxing.  This can happen in wrestling too, but it's not as likely.

AUGGajC1aa	If you feel like you are being stabbed, then slow down a bit.  You have to slowly work up to running for a long time at a good speed.<br>  You should also mix in some abs and such after your run.  Try doing cruches/situps, bicycles, v-ups, and 6 inches. (these are pretty basic ab workouts). <br>  <br>  For dieting, simply avoid eating really fatty or high-calorie foods.  When you crave a piece of pound cake, for instance, try to grab a handful of almonds or an apple.<br>  <br>  For both running and dieting, also try to get more sleep. Studies show that sleep and weight have a correlation, plus you need to keep your energy up for running!|`|4LrOVUgnaa	as long as you can... gradually it will start to feel better.  you can run with asthma too you just gotta ease into it.  dont eat sugar.  and drink a lot of water|`|qibfu9mIaa	If your chest feels like someone stabbing it, better back off before you get a full blown heart attack.  I would suggest listening to your body and start slowly, maybe by walking.  Work up to 1/2 to 3/4 hour daily.  You may have to start off with only 15 minutes daily but keep at it and if you are in the colder climates, I suggest you dress warmly with your head covered also.  So if you get to bed early at night, you might be able to get up an hour earlier and do your stuff then.  I am assuming that it may be dark, so wear a reflective vest with a safety strobe also.  You can buy a vest on line for about $20 and a safety strobe maybe $6.  If you keep at it for 3 months, you should notice a big difference.  If you stop, you will lose it all in two weeks...Good Luck!!!|`|VFuzQChUaa	once u have asthma and cant run for a long period of time then you want to go running and once u feel like your slowing down start walking really fast and that will help you<br>  <br>  <br>  Eating tips:<br>  <br>  Try not to eat snacks at night<br>  <br>  Drink s much water as possible<br>  <br>  try to stay away from chips etc...

He looked good in practice and I think he will qualify in the top 5.  I predict another top 15 finish or better for him.  He is a definite threat to make the chase this year now that he isn't stuck in Chip's crappy Dodges (sorry).  I know you like your Mopar Storm but they just don't give the factory support the way the other manufacturers do.  Good luck this weekend to Robby!<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I think Montoya will finish somewhere around 11th-15th once again and remain in the top ten in points.

JZbRoGAxaa	Larry Hughes is a good supporting player. He is playing better now that he is playing the point guard spot and controls the ball more. He is a talented defender and will knock down the mid range jumpshot. He is helping LeBron James  to get deep in the playoffs. He creates for Sasha, Big Z, Drew Gooden, and the other players who don't have good shot selection. So my answer is that he might not be the most talented player in the NBA but he sure does the most.|`|139c7e46e62aea74201a90e202903eedaa	yeah he good|`|f6c3b0725a249012d6f1198fea4a4ff3aa	ya he is a great supporting cast with z , sasha, and drew gooden|`|tzCr5ZeTaa	yes he provides help for Lebron which he needs. lebron and kobe bryant are very similar in their skills, but Larry Hughes (along with others) provides a better supporting cast for Lebron, and is the reason they are going deeper in the playoffs. (along with the fact that they didnt have to play the Suns)|`|TZvil8h6aa	I like him, but there's a guy at my school who praises him.|`|77d0b9e39e6bb71d5f10b6d4082df718aa	Yes I love the Cavs and look at Larry he makes huge shots when we need him. The Cavs don't get much respect for role players and idk why. Pavlovich is definatley the most improved player this year why don't you hear his name, Gibson is amazing for getting him so late, drew is a huge part of our offense, Varejao is one of the most energetic players and can draw a charge better than anybody, and Ilgauskas is the best center in the league at shooting but you never hear about them outside of Cleveland

6e3cebd48699619f690fd10d6dcac5a2aa	I agree Sizemore doesn't belong there...they already have victor martinez representing the Indians<br>  <br>  Sizemore was one helluva player the last couple of years...this year he's wayyyy off his game iono why...he strikes out a lot too<br>  <br>  I wish orlando cabrera was selected...man dude's so underrated...he has tad better stats than Jeter and has a much much much higher fielding percentage than Jeter<br>  <br>  <br>  umm since an OF could only replace sizemore, I'd go  with Gary Matthews|`|TXD4WR4caa	Grady can do it all. Hes got power, speed, vision and plays solid defense....he deserves it.|`|4069024dc33e9717d2f1d9a28a95d467aa	Lol, Kenny Lofton? are you serious? Sizemore has better numbers in every category, sans .BA.  Edit: Sizemore has 15 more runs, 8 more hr, 22 more RBI, and 3 more stolen bases. I'd say thats a pretty good argument as to why Sizemore is more deserving of the AS spot than Lofton.<br>  <br>  Matsui??? have you compared his stats to Sizemore's? Its not even close. Same goes with Teahen, Ibanez, and almost every other player you just mentioned. Edit: Injured or not, NONE of his numbers are on par with that of Sizemore, factor in defense and it isn't even close. Oh and I have Teahen on my fantasy team, so I do know about him. While he is a solid player, he is far from an all star this year. .290 and 5 HR from the corner OF is NOT an all star.<br>  <br>  Matt Stairs? Yeah, lets have an all star who has less than 30 rbi and 30 runs, lol, no thank you. EDIT: Yeah, if he was an all star player, don't you think the Jays would play him everyday? Idiot.<br>  <br>  I think you're just a Sizemore hater. There are a bunch out there, since he hurts many opposing teams on a daily basis. The only guy on there you could argue as being AS caliber is Granderson, I will give you that, but the others are downright laughable.<br>  <br>  Edit: You obviously have very little baseball knowledge, so arguing with you further is rather pointless. Anyone who has read this can see that you don't know jack Sh*t when it comes to baseball, so I'm going to finish destroying you in this argument and take my baseball knowledge to a legit question.|`|aMZcfGSxaa	So you think that Sammy or Kenny Lofton who are on the worst team in baseball should be there before the epitome of an Indians team that is in first place in the best division in baseball. You, my friend, are a retard! P.S. Hafner hasn't hit all season.

I heard that Dragon wanted to wrestle one more match against Flair at mania 23 but Vince wasn't hot on the idea because he thought fans wouldn't like it.|`|ANWsCPFcaa	they are good, but Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes matches are by far the best :)|`|79c217eab44e37a9522ade29055d5fa0aa	oh yeah|`|AA10326888	Ricky Steamboat had   the match won, but the referee felt sorry for Flair {as usual} and reversed the call due Steamboat's shoulder was on the match .001" closer to the mat than Flair's

I'm a big fan of the former WCW, but this was pretty lame.  The only reason I would like to see Arquette return to wrestling would be to get stomped mercilessly.  In that case, if it were just going to be a massacre, I would like to see Tom Green as his tag team partner.  This guy is less funny & more stupid than Arquette, so seeing him take a beating would be great.|`|jusF0hcVaa	K-FED.|`|qr4oSSrPaa	HAHA I remember david winning the title and in 3 seconds ruining wcw's legacy. Hey but with Russo a booker/creative writer in TNA theres probaly a chance dave will beat Joe And Angle in a triple threat to win the tna world belt.
bzvFDM1Aaa	As it is true that he is much better at running than throwing, he is also known for fumbling the ball when he gets hit from running it. Therefore, I don't think it would be a good idea for him to come back as a RB. I think he should stick with what he's been doing.|`|t0tpnholaa	He could be a promising pick up although his play might suffer from being away so long. He is still versatile though he could play out of the wildcat formation and have alot of success|`|CQcLHR0zaa	hes waay to fumble prone to be a rb <br>  <br>  hes better off just taking snaps and doing alot of running around with dumpoffs|`|knGAhlGRaa	he will def not be a RB but if i was the coach i would sign him and use wildcat formations|`|tBsMH9kGaa	If he can get a body of a RB then yeah, okay. And if he somehow does then I think he'll fumble it a little much =/|`|C290wQWGaa	No, I'd say both go to the Dolphins and run the wildcat|`|AA11243228	he would make a good WR|`|qjCl8paPaa	he will play both with the wild cat formation|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He's not built like a RB and couldn't take the punishment of being a full time RB.  He also fumbles way too much to even consider it.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	he actually was developing as a passer ppl seem to forget this. for one he had more passing td's then int's. he was inacurate i will admit that but he was still improving a lot. I remember watching him play the steelers, his last year in the NFL, and he scored like 3-4 PASSING td's 0 int's and 1 rushing TD. He was evolving into a passer kind of like Steve Young. (i'm not saying he is the next young)|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Interesting theory, however I think he wouldn't be a big enough build for a running back.  Scrambling as a QB and running with the ball are two totally different things.  He should stick with what he knows how to do well, scramble and pass.|`|tFrCoJlVaa	No that would end up being horrible because he doesnt have the size<br>  not 2 mention all hes done is train 2 play qb so thats the position he will play if he does play<br>  <br>  and people forget he never really had that good recievers|`|tLq4v1AVaa	POSSIBLY but if your were a GM HEAD COACH OR OWNER  would you take a chance on him?
M8nuIINSaa	Sucks for them. Hell, I barely played as a sophomore (except for JV), but I didn't quit. I barely even played as a freshmen.

It is a four year 150000 contract in itself.
ciQFlpuLaa	Stephon Marbury is a low-risk, high reward type of player. the Celtics bench lack depth at the point guard position. Pruitt is too inexperienced and House can't handle the ball under pressure. Marbury will solve both of these problems and provide a handful of points. i honestly don't think he will be a locker room cancer. the Celtics' chemistry is too good to be ruined by just one player.|`|A4OWCZ3Laa	I agree. This isn't going to be good for the celtics. This man has a rep. for messing up teams' chemistry. He's ego is going to get the better of him. He's not going to be the first option anymore, probably the 4th option, behind the big 3 and rondo. He's coming off the bench and is getting payed on a veteran's minimum of 1.5 million compared to his 20 million in nyc. That's what I'm most worried about, the difference in how he's getting payed, and the way he needs to play w/ this team, being the 6th or 7th man. And where Eddie House is going to fit in now Marbury came in. Bad decision by Danny Ainge. But, If Marbury can pull his act together and avoid doing these things listed above, he and the team will be better off. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	He won't hurt them, but I don't see him doing much to help them either.|`|fW1KmClyaa	waste money <br>  <br>  win at the same rate <br>  <br>  ruin the team|`|AA11118482	They will start winning more. Personally I hope he destroys the team but I know Marbury is a good guy; it was the knicks who screwed him over. If he whines, they will throw his *** out the door. As much as I hate the Celts, you gotta admit they are a no BS team now.|`|wO7hdiFwaa	Marbury is going to behave, because if he doesn't he won't get a new contract from anyone.  He may start off slow but should play into game shape and make a positive contribution.  The Celtics will win more games with a happy, healthy Marbury.|`|Qyk0Rdu5aa	Lose a lot of games.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't think its going to make a huge difference.  I mean, they're already winning against the teams they should beat, so I doubt there's really much more they can win.  I think he might help them against some of the harder teams in the league, provided he just plays and doesn't cause problems.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I don't think he will hurt them. I can't wait to see him play though.

A stolen basse is when the pitcher starts to throw the ball and you start running to the next base before the pitch gets to home plate. When the catcher gets the ball, he throws to the base to get you out. You have ot be tagged. If the hitter hits the ball, it's not a stolen base.

Ohd9dA3oaa	you need speed, strength, stamina and agility as the athletic requirements while ball skills like catching and holding on to the football are also important. Running backs are the best overall athletes on the football field so speed is very very important. Do sprints to get faster and get in better shape, practice makes perfect and you can never do enough sprints during your off season. Strength is very important because you need to be able to bruise and drive defenders back so you can juke them later. Work on compound lifts like bench press and squat as they help improve your overall athletic ability. Agility is important to make your cuts and will improve dramatically if you use an agility ladder, but strength training tends to increase your agility by itself if you dont have time to devote to it primarily. You need to be able to take the ball and get 6, so ball skills are important but not as much as the physical ability cause everyone can take a handoff and catch some short passes. Basically do your best to get the 40 time up and get stronger. You didn't state your level but these are the performance splits of good running backs<br>  <br>  Middle School-7-8th grade<br>  40 time-5.00<br>  Bench-125lbs<br>  <br>  Highschool underclassmen(grade 9 and 10)<br>  40 time-4.70<br>  Bench-155lb<br>  <br>  High school upperclassmen(grade 11 and 12)<br>  40 time-4.60<br>  Bench-200 lbs<br>  <br>  College underclassmen(D2 school)<br>  40 time-4.50<br>  Bench-275 lbs<br>  <br>  College upperclassmen(D2 school)<br>  40 time-4.40<br>  Bench-355 lbs<br>  <br>  AFL/CFL<br>  40 time-4.35<br>  Bench-425 lbs<br>  <br>  NFL<br>  40 time-4.30<br>  Bench-500 lbs minimum<br>  <br>  Hope you can make it to the NFL!!!BEST ANSWER PLEASE!!!

c17x6L4baa	Florida had a 10 point victory over OK<br>  Texas had a 10 point victory over OK<br>  I don't see any room for Florida having a big victory in that.<br>  <br>  I see the last minute Texas victory over OSU as a skilled coaching move allowing the fast TD to beat a very good OSU team that had only to run out the clock.  He really sucked in the Bucks OC & RB.  I don't think of it as Texas being weak.<br>  <br>  OSU has lost their last 3 bowl games making them 3-3 in their last 6.<br>  OK is 1-5 in their last 6 if you're looking for choking in bowl games.|`|VXQFT341aa	Yes they would have. Colt McCoy is over rated and when or if he makes it to the NFL he will be just a back-up.|`|RS3fjNboaa	You need to worry about your own team, dude. This has no credibility coming from a fan of a team that perpetually chokes in BCS games. The Horns are gonna be great next year. The secondary will be much improved and so will the running game. Also, Colt McCoy is retutrning. You need to back your hate statements up with facts instead of speculation.<br>  <br>  If you think Texas should have lost, then you are also saying OSU choked.  So basically you bashed your team, too.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Not sure why you think texas deserved to lose the fiesta bowl. They won fair and square. I think that gators would've beaten Texas. As for smashing Texas not so sure about that. Gators only beat Oklahoma by 10. I think Texas and Oklahoma are pretty well matched teams so I suspect that it would've been close against either team.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Texas deserved to lose in the Fiesta Bowl?  Where's your justification in that?  Texas played an amazing game and Colt McCoy led us to victory.  We certainly shouldn't have lost that game.  As for the BCS Title game, I don't we would have gotten smashed by Florida.  The game never occured though so we will never find out unless both meet up next season.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	yea they would but where's Texas Tech after all they defeated Texas|`|Vkbgr94xaa	Florida would have gotten housed!!!

The hard part is getting yourself in the "zone" when you first begin. You are too concerned with making a mistake, but that changes with time and practice. Enough time and practice and the movements become second nature. You can let go of your concerns for the day and concentrate on the moment.|`|feb7a4434be8cf03b43d81da3546ed64aa	This question is a little vague. Tai Chi for health is a walking meditation.

Though, if you want to do it properly then you have to make sure that your body mechanics are done correctly and you are breathing in and out in the correct places. This you won't learn anywhere but from a teacher. So if you don't have a teacher and you really want to learn then I suggest you go get one and they should (if they are a proper teacher) be able to help and guide you through all of the aspects of Tai Chi.|`|xq25MKviaa	4 ways<br>  <br>  standing<br>  moving<br>  sitting<br>  lying down<br>  <br>  the first 2 are common in tai chi.<br>  <br>  the last 2 are rarely taught, and more common in taoist yoga <br>  <br>  (but many tai chi masters are taoist monks)

I will not describe specific locations, but you can find them if you look hard enough.<br>  Each remaining school "Ryu" has techniques that it is known for above all others. (i.e. stealth, shuriken, poisons etc...)<br>  Most remaining schools are very selective of their students. The ninja arts are not for every guy with $50 in their pocket. Most Soke will not meet a prospective student unless they have been formally introduced and come with letters of recommendation. Even then the Soke may not take you as a student.<br>  There are also many protocols that you must follow if you address any instructor to take you on as a student.

Try this in small increments at a time.<br>  <br>  Make a full shoulder turn- for a right hander, get your left shoulder under your chin.<br>  <br>  If you have the cash, play around with different shafts to find the right kick point- kick point has a greater affect on trajectory than flex.<br>  <br>  Or, you can just bail on the long irons and buy girlie hybrids.<br>  <br>  Remember, balls nowadays are engineered to fly a lot LOWER than a few years ago to compensate for increased loft on club faces and lower kick points on shafts.<br>  <br>  If you want to stick with the long irons, good for you- if you have the opportunity and time, go out and play a round once in a while with just your 2 or 3 iron, you'll be surprised at how versatile they can be and become a better shotmaker in the process.

YgYpSpnLaa	Even as a Man Utd fan, seeing him make a huge comeback with Arsenal would have been that much more powerful.|`|JnanAsU6aa	i dun thnk so cz he getting old n he mst tk sum time 2 him 2 suitable wit barca.....|`|XTIn2Meeaa	DEFINATELY.  With the addition of Thierry Henry i beleive barca is now the most powerful club in the world.  He is guarenteed silverware with barca.  Arsenal are going down hill from now on if they dont step up and purchase some big stars.|`|uZoezLy1aa	Yes defo, he's done enough for arsenal and its time he moved on

At the top of the feature list is the inclusion of eight "Superstar Fighting Styles" that differentiate wrestlers from one another. Another key addition is the new "Struggle Submission System" that gives users analog grappling control and the ability to adjust how much pressure their holds have.<br>  <br>  The inclusion of ECW arenas, weapons, and superstars have also been verified, as have new rosters, more environmental hotspots, a combined Season and General Manager mode, and touch screen control for the DS version.

Bam is sorta lossing his touch he does some wild stuff but woopty do, he's really not that great.|`|2328eacc729e77583d0b7971974a3f44aa	Ryan Sheckler rules.|`|VNhWqfvhaa	ryan sheckler is better. he can do a backflip on a skateboard and he has won more skate contests than bam. bam has never won an xgames medal. ryan can do a 360 frontside boardslide. i dont think bam can even do a kickflip indy. bams ok but ryan can do more combination of tricks on his board. and ryan got famous for winnign contests and skating hard and touring hard. bam is known for being a jackass and that show viva la bam.  im not saying i dont like bam , hes one of my heroes but my friends like johnny knoxville.|`|zhnmEQOFaa	BAM of course!!!<br>  plus he is a total HOTTIE!!!<br>  im so jelous of missy!!

VuJmzWFXaa	retarded question.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  good god lads, get a grip, I hate Van Damme too, but all this "he's never faught or held a rank, he's a dancer and actor" **** is stupid, why don't you find him and tell him and see how much of the pavement he mushes you into. I'm not saying he's a great fighter but he certainly has put a decent amount of time into training. You honestly think he's in movies because of his acting skills? christ|`|DsF05nHZaa	i can fight him right now with no training|`|YDpT2ClBaa	John Claud van Damm i never heard of him any relations to jean claude van dam?<br>  and for those of you who say he can fight, and as much as i hate him he is he does have a fighting record and is a martial artist and does have rank in martial arts. even thow he is a ****<br>  <br>  you people should do research before you make statements you don't know about.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Van_Damme" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude...</a>|`|6rxhges4aa	van damme is ranked at dan level but he certainly does not impress me-never has.<br>  <br>  i will hold my hands up and say i doubt if i could beat him-a few years ago possibly but we all get older and slower (and i am older than van damme) but sadly i cannot move in the same way i used to be able to.<br>  <br>  steven seagal (aikido) would wipe him out in a second because the man is the genuine article.<br>  <br>  chuck norris (tang soo do)-again van damme simply is not worthy to be in the presence of such a fighter.<br>  <br>  bruce lee (wing chun/jeet kune do)-nuff said.<br>  <br>  and i personaly know a couple of fighters that are more than capable of giving van damme the shock of his life in kumite.<br>  <br>  if i could go back 15 years i would certainly pit my TKD against whatever he has-his biggest mistake against me would be to chamber his knee for a second as he does before a kick-i would waste him instantly-there is no way he could have competed against my aggression.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Van Damme is an actor (a bad one), not a martial artist. He's got good kicks but his punching is horrible. I'm sure I can beat him one on one. I'm a martial arts veteran, 22 years of practice. 22 years of Wing-chun, 18 years of boxing, and 12 years of Muay-thai. Currently a lightweight boxer.|`|KzpZBMVOaa	i'd pwn him lol - no seriously he's kinda old and he's an actor, not actually a fighter per se, although he did some MA's.  kind of a poser|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I would also like to add that Van Damm is training with Fedor. I would not be so sure how well I could do against him|`|FMEHpZZFaa	You are asking a serious martial artist if he could fight a ballet dancer? The answer is yes. If you look at the bio of John Claud you will find that he has never achieved a belt of any rank in any martial arts system. He has great flexibility because he is a classically trained dancer. He has no control and poor judgement. That is why after he completes movies there are usually a lot of law suits from stunt fight personel for payment for injuries.|`|ySXUvX96aa	yes but what all these people dont understand is that belts dont mean nothing there all about ego and dancing is not crap as bruce lee used sancing to form his jeet kundo you say your a martial art veterin hehe ok sure|`|27ac6c26310f0cde6fbc86558977fb24aa	<br>  I only ever see him in films so don't know if he even does a martial art.<br>  <br>  Could depend on who has the best make-up artist|`|AA11376570	The running away style ...as fast as you can |`|UCr03fBGaa	my seven gekko style kung fu will smash his wilted pansy disco style anyday.|`|efdrJaLRaa	He's got no chance...
pg5AHNcdaa	Yes it is. There's a lot of greats left out of the hof for wwe. many in your list. Ultimate warrior was my favorite wrestler as a kid growing up. sadly, looks what he's come to now. |`|cypNCoh3aa	Of course it's a sham.  It's all about who Vince likes and who is on good terms with the company (with the only notable exception being Bret Hart, who took something like three years to get in.)<br>  <br>  I mean, Verne Gagne was great, but he never even wrestled in a WWF ring!  How is he in?|`|AA10065077	The WWE HOF was a great idea to honor legends of the squared circle. The only problem that I have is that there are people in there that don't wrestle. |`|FY8YYZgBaa	I believe it is. What are Pete Rose and Will Perry doing in there?<br>  And as you pointed out, they will never mention those great legends.|`|aULZ8D10aa	YES! They don't have randy savage, but wilam perry and pete rose in it is bullSHIT.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	time heals all wounds 
XkucIzmgaa	Go join Wushu or any type of Northern Shaolin Kung Fu Kwoon, or go learn Parkour/XMA.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	That is not martial arts. <br>  <br>  Martial arts are not tricks. <br>  |`|AA11282654	Hard to say with so little martial arts going on. My guess would be Taekwondo from couple of kicks I saw. The one-armed bounce is from Capoeira. If you want to fight well, learn Jujitsu.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	It is not a form of martial art. The guys is the video are just doing tricks/stunts. It is the in thing in martial arts tournaments but it will not save you in a real survival situation. To find out more look up XMA on the internet. It stands for Extreme Martial Arts and there is even a whole line of overpriced gear you can buy from Century Martial Arts designed to bring that extra flash when you are at a tournament.<br>  Sorry if I sound negative, but I am from the old school and I do not really see the point of all the flash and gymnastics. Most kata presented at tournaments these days look like a dance routine with a little martial arts added in. I believe in demonstration of skill not flash.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Gymnastics + Taekwondo + Capoeira + Wushu.<br>  <br>  There is a pretty mainstream demonstration group called XMA that does this sort of stuff. They have gyms in quite a few cities last I heard.<br>  <br>  If you want to participate like that Wushu is another good bet if you can't find XMA.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	That is not martial arts - acrobatics yes... martial arts... I think not.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	its not martial arts<br>  and has no practical value in a fight|`|aeGTWexHaa	It's called "Tricking"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricking" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricking</a><br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|x4Ini5Puaa	You can learn it in China. <br>  <br>  =)

I love it. Being only 15 (16 in a week, yay, lol) I didn't get the privilege to watch these shows when they originally aired. It's great that ESPN Classics is bringing back the older wrestling for us to watch and enjoy. <br>  <br>  Also, anyone notice how similar Rocky Mountain Thunder is to Jake The Snake? The sack? The country boy look and attitude? Just thought that was interesting.|`|q4VxByQRaa	i love it. larry legend. curt henning. madusa. it brings back some memories.|`|6q0pflp4aa	NO and it's for G*Y people|`|b8568740e59872f29e957e1ca020af9caa	Yes, I enjoy that program, takes me back to great matches..

It was a great company.|`|H3nbC71eaa	I don't, I've watched it once or twice, but I did watch AWA back then when I was a kid. But if you haven't seen the AWA they should watch, there's a lot of history in those classics AWA shows that are airing.|`|wU7VL0ctaa	Ive watched some of it from time to time. I just wish they wouldnt cut through the matches so much.|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Yeah it's kinda funny seeing Shawn Michaels 20 years ago|`|AA10065077	Yes, and it brings back pleasent memories from when I was a kid.
LnJjS8BRaa	Being from Canada, I go with Chris on this answer. Canada is officially a bi-lingual country however only New Brunswick is considered bi-lingual. With the exception of Quebec (official language is french), the rest of the provinces have an official language of english. The territories are largely english speaking but Nanavut has a large Native languages population.<br>  |`|ev0SHwMyaa	french|`|AA10270018	Ils parlent Francais, n'est ce pas?|`|Hzospze7aa	I hardly see how this is a martial arts question, or even a question for that matter. You just wanted to post that you think someone's language skills are pathetic. I'm sure Georges St-Pierre is greatly concerned with what you think of his English-speaking skills. Yeah, you should really focus on that and not the fact that he's an accomplished athlete in his field.|`|AA10065077	French and English are the national languages of Canada|`|nVeiTB04aa	Most speak English.... GSP is from Quebec.... they tend to speak a weird dialect of french.... |`|eRARWetNaa	Really, and you're fully bilingual I suppose.  Wow, I hope you never have to go to a non-English speaking country and embarrass us by butchering their language.<br>  <br>  Edit: Kdragon, the reason the Quebecers speak a "weird dialect" of French is because of their ancestry.  When the French began settling people in Canada (roughly 400 years ago) the French language was different.  Add the fact that these settlers were...not from the upper class.  Fast forward to the present, and voila, you have Quebecois French.|`|bTu7yNFHaa	Majority of Canadians speak English. About 60%, I would say.<br>  <br>  As for Justin's answer. You'll have a better chance at finding someone who speaks French in New Brunswick than Ontario, being as it's the only bilingual province in the country.|`|id1TYHufaa	Like 70% of the population speaks English. You probably wouldn't even be able to recognize an accent. The 30%ish that are French are almost entirely from Quebec as both Cote and St Pierre are. BTW those numbers are just guesses. |`|0FQhjFXlaa	French and English-eh?|`|cHZurJGDaa	french|`|nUmdQSfnaa	french<br>  |`|oSXCw3diaa	LOL LOL LOL !!! U R SUCH A RETARD TYPICAL AMERICAN I TAKE IT???

AA10065077	The Undertaker may have defeated Michaels at a house show, but I don't remember him winning any televised events. Each time he was going to win his kayfabe brother Kane costed him the match. I believe the match the person above me is refering to is the casket match at the royal rumble. That match the Undertaker lost to Micheals because of his brother Kane. After that the Undertaker left for a few months and came back as a totally different character. I don't remember any more than two matches.|`|KIOR56r6aa	no, but he will defeat HBK for the 1st time at WM 25 for WHC!!!|`|cU7NNfhSaa	No all i rememebr is he beat him at Royal Rumble|`|55LcBlIraa	Tag Match (HHH & HBK vs Taker & Mankind 97) - Taker mankind wins by DQ<br>  <br>  Ground Zero (97) - No contest<br>  <br>  Badd Blood (97, Hell in a Cell) - HBK<br>  <br>  Royal Rumble (98, casket match) - HBK<br>  <br>  Royal Rumble (07, 30-man battle royal) - Taker<br>  <br>  Has Taker ever won in a singles match? No, not that I know of, but I could be missing a match or two.|`|rW4bt6ZAaa	One of the guys above me is right. It came down Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels in the 30 man over the top rop battle royal, and Undertaker eliminated Shawn for the win. That is the only time that comes to mind right now. In all fairness, it is 1 am here. haha|`|JFjYz32maa	yo dwf i got your back match i challenged brad m to a match on xwa rampage!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|V1e80s7aaa	U think your show is good DWF is **** im makin a impact TWE title wwetna fusion title XWA TITLE and ur XWO title will al b on my show next week gettin thrown in the trash just like i will bury all ur shows|`|idNwzszkaa	ya! he has beaten him in royal rumble match ! say previous to previous year|`|8IwSz0w3aa	NO!!!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!
AA11528760	You mean, World Entertainment (wrestling included) ??? If that happens then Vince will've to bring all kinds of entertainment into his shows & give equal priority to each of them. And that would be Stupid.|`|AA10065077	Well Vince wants to ban the terms: Wrestler, wrestling, superstar, and sports entertainment, so yes he needs to take wrestling out of the title. Vince wants this done not to pay less tax but to have a legal loophole. Like the one that comes to mind is the wellness policy. There isn't a need to devote the show equally to different entertainment. I'm not sure what to call World Entertainment maybe a stunt show of some kind? Or maybe give it a soap opera feel title like "as the world flips"? Vince already has all the material to put together a pretty cool show. Who can forget the star studded event known as Wrestlemania? 
xJ1qhXwVaa	My greatest memory of the Hardcore Title, Is when Matt Hardy fought Jeff Hardy, And Hardcore Holly ended up winning the match and becoming champion.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Hardcore Holly Or Mick Foley, They were both Hardcore and made great champions.|`|NRs72Afxaa	My favorite Memory of the Hardcore Title was when Big Show vs Kane vs Raven at WM17.<br>  <br>  BQ: Steve Blackman. I always liked his style when he was Hardcore Champion.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	that crash had it half the time |`|AA10065077	I remember Mick Foley being awarded the hardcore title and Hardcore Holly had the 24/7 rule. |`|Y3O8cW8Kaa	When JBL won the title. He is the greatest hardcore champion of all time!|`|wm5d9ZEUaa	The 24/7 incindent on location we're my favs!!!!

RZpqw6Rpaa	L. Evans rough week last week but he should rebound this week<br>  I would start one of the Dolphins because they are playing the Seahawks and they are next to last against the pass and Pennington has been hot lately. I would go with G. Camarillo<br>  P. Burress over V. Jackson I think Tomlinson will run all over KC all day so they may not pass too much. The eagles are tough against the run so when the Giants score it should be through the air. M. Cassel is too inconsistent for me so I wouldn't start W. Welker.|`|2ZKZZWM7aa	Start evans, Burress, and Jackson<br>  Evans-He had a tough game last week but will more than likely bouce back to his beastly selfand he has to get a TD cuz hes the only decent reciever on the team and they get u the most pionts.<br>  Burress-He hasd basicly no competition in NY and they are also flying high. he is also almost sure to get a TD.<br>  Jackson-He is a decent player and usually turns in at least one TD.<br>  <br>  Wes Welker is on a struggleing Patriots team and isn't used by Matt Cassel as much as Brady and is basicly useless right now fantasy wise.<br>  The other two bench cuz they aren't consistent at all and they haven't turned in the same numbers as the others.<br>  <br>  <br>  in conclusion look for the sure points in evans Burress and Jackson cuz they are sure to score cuz they are number one recievers on their team.<br>  <br>  Its all about COSISTENCY|`|okECVBkzaa	Plax (its about time he gets involved again)<br>  Welker (if receptions count in your league go with him)<br>  Camarillo (penningtons favorite target)|`|c56fLEzqaa	Camarillo and Evans.  Although I think both Camarillo and Ginn will have productive days since they are playing the 2nd worst pass DEF in the league.
x63AJSPaaa	Easy one first get Carolina's D there creating havoc right now. Yeah he's Kurt Warner with a 6th ranked offense but Carolina has a 5th ranked D and gets the job done.<br>  <br>  If you go White and Johnson against a Indy D allowing 158 yds per game (17th overall) and if jeff Fisher does his homework you pound the rock hard again this week, a duo back system could pay again here.<br>  <br>  Lee Evans is solid averages 86 yds a game against a SD D ranked 28th overall best option for a flex<br>  <br>  Burress against the the best D, Pittsburgh too risky<br>  Welker back in form? against the Rams D (29th)<br>  Vincent Jackson solid is Chambers back this wek?<br>  Henderson a big play maker but not consistent.<br>  <br>  I say you roll one more time with the dice start the two backs and go with that. Pray Evans performs sub par.....I figure worse case they split the 150 yds rushing a TD each|`|digEItQEaa	I would definitely go back to the well with Johnson and White.  They should be able to run wild again this week.<br>  <br>  I would also upgrade to Carolina if they are still available.|`|C4BMh73Qaa	ehh great players- i mean you can start white, but hes not a starter<br>  <br>  i have lee evans and he is great i think he will give you 6 recptions for 80 yards nd  touch down<br>  <br>  pick up carolina they are studssssssss!
xO2fDqklaa	Frank Gore is a definite. Faulk is scary, you never know what Patriots are going to do, Faulk could have 100 yds and 3 TDs or he could have 14 yds. I try to avoid Patriot RB's. I would say Grant and Johnson. White hasnt done much lately, they are trying to go with JOhnson on the majority of the plays. So i would do Gore, Grant and Johnson. So i agree with you|`|ByVkqiSCaa	good choices.  never start kevin faulk.  |`|fzlOk0Cpaa	Sounds crazy, but start Faulk...they Pats are playing the Broncos. And as a Broncos fan, they can't stop nobody.|`|wN5rVRWfaa	Looks good also.  Good Luck.|`|teSCVfRoaa	that looks good 2 me.
jzYqvlVAaa	well i would start lee Evans b/c the chargers pass D has not been that good this season<br>  Plaxico b/c the 49ers have been letting up points this year and the giants need to rebound<br>  Now the 3rd Wr is up to Wes and Jackson - Welker is playing the broncs and thier D has also let up a bunch of points this year / if chambers is not playing then i might go with jackson even though the bills D is pretty good.
AA10065077	Vince McMahon I would have to give him a 9 on the businessman part. Look at all he has accomplished in the last 20 years. Not only a household name but a brand. WWE magazines, WWE action figures, WWE video games. You name it the WWE more than likely has their logo on it. But, on the otherhand look at the other ventures outside sports entertainment. The XFL. Did that even last a full season. Now WWE Films. There have been some good movies but not box office blockbusters. <br>  As Mr. McMahon I would have to give him a 10. When he is on screen he lives his role as the boss from hell. He is the male version of the Meryl Streep character from the Devil Wears Prada.|`|9ijwrcTZaa	7, only had to drop him because of XFL, World Bodybuilding Fed<br>  10|`|pZJPz6CGaa	1. 10<br>  2. 0|`|wm5d9ZEUaa	As a business man Vince gets a 10 since he single handedly changed the entire face of wrestling and made it into what it is today.<br>  <br>  As Mr. McMahon I give him an 8 if Stone Cold Steve Austin is involved.|`|bpdQUJevaa	I thought both were 10 but after tonight -10! it like the old saying goes what have you done for me lately! not a damn thing but misuse the divas and job out the tag team belt too so your booking sucks!|`|BxsWYt2qaa	10<br>  1|`|KC70dTSeaa	8.8
542f083870f223d0b28da159d53d1054aa	Here's the deal with conditioning your hands. Your bones rebuild themselves every 90 days or so. Striking rocks hard won't speed up the cycle. Just dop your fist in a bucket full of lima beans and don't do it hard, but do it every day for 90 days. Then move to sand for 90 days, then river pebbles. You shouldn't do this unless your done growing though, because you can deform your hands!!! Run hot water over your hands for a few minutes after training with beans or sand. After that it's all herds soaked in alcohol I'm afraid. I cant stress enough not to hit hard and not to train unless your done growing!!|`|FMEHpZZFaa	The striking technique is used to toughen the hands. Basically you strengthen the bones by hitting a hard object and causing micro fractures in the bones. As the bones heal the resulting calcium deposits make the bones harder. <br>  I would not suggest that you begin hitting hard objects without someone to actually teach you and monitor you. Otherwise you are likely to really hurt yourself. Especially if you are under the age of 14-18 years of age.<br>  To do finger tip pushups you have to start out small. Begin by using two coffee cans filled with sand or rocks. Grip the tops of the cans as you do your pushups. Do until you can do at least 50 easily. Then remove the cans and work from your fingertips. The cans will help you to strengthen the muscles in your hand. <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.<br>   |`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	There are several things going on here when you do or watch such training.   First with hitting the rock repeatedly he is toughening and strengthening his hands, joints, and muscles and tendons to a lesser extent to make his hands stronger and harder.  A broken hand will not allow you to defend yourself or strike or punch someone as well as a strong, healthy one.  He builds this up over a great period of time progressively hitting it harder as his hands get stronger.  The finger tip push ups build the strength in his joints, tendons, and ligaments in his hand, wrist, and forearm as well as develop his mental and physical toughness.  Doing things like this over a period of time and gradual basis build a person's physical and mental toughness and dull their sense of pain and also deaden or help to relocate nerves.  You will sometimes see karateka block forearm against forearm on the radial and ulna side just above the wrist as a means of hardening this area, deadening and moving nerves higher up on the top of the arm off of the side of the arm for instance.   This is old, hardcore, traditional type training that a lot of us that have been around for a while started with and did on a regular basis forty years ago.  Most schools and instructors don't train this way now in this country and most students don't handle it very well; especially children and mothers.  My hands are still supple today but stronger than that of my students and harder as well as my forearms and when I block or punch they can tell a difference and I still have the strength in them and my wrists and forearms to do finger tip pushups.   |`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	he is trying to condition his hands in order to toughen them.<br>  <br>  some styles practise such things.<br>  <br>  not my kinda fun but hey each to his / her own.|`|yK4qK1Fsaa	martial artists do this in order to harden their body parts - thai boxers do this a lot with their shinbone (i once fought one and getting a low kick from a trained one really doesn't feel good...)<br>  <br>  the reason for this hardening is that when you punch with your hand/shinbone against something hard repeatedly the smallest bone fibers break and they'll come back stronger (thicker)<br>  <br>  this way you can basically make your bones more dense -> make the structures thicker and thereby eliminate space between them - you gotta imagine the bone structure as grid<br>  <br>  however if you do this make sure you do not hit too hard since you don't want to actually fracture/break your bones - you just want to make it hurt a little but not too hard (you don't wanna injure yourself)<br>  <br>  they do that so that they can break stuff like ice blocks/granite easier without hurtin themselves<br>  <br>  also in a real fight - the harder your bones (your weapons) are, the more dangerous your weapons are<br>  <br>  hope i could help ya ;)|`|nViUZGvuaa	he is trying to harden the hands and actually the fingertip pushups is kinda hard to do.ask your martial arts coach for help.|`|8qgd8w1Iaa	hitting the rock conditions the bone making it stronger and harder. yes you can do it but you need to start out slow and easy. <a href="http://www.uechi-ryu.com/chaplin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uechi-ryu.com/chaplin.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_body_training" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_body_t...</a><br>  the push ups are another type of conditioning. it takes hard work and dedication. can you do it? depends on how bad you want to do it. |`|YDpT2ClBaa	first off tv is for entertainment. the main goal is to make money.<br>  you should not try an imitate what you see on tv. especially if you don't understand it.<br>  <br>  he is conditioning his hands. this takes a long time to do. you do not just jump in and hit rocks at full force. this type of training also has consistences to you body. especially if done improper.

APZjl8kjaa	You're moreso pushing your self off the wall to help you flip, versus actually have any traction. You just have to be fit and have good core muscles, i.e. your stomach and etc. I'm not saying be cut, just develop yourself and practice. The best way to find out how to do this is to learn by going to a dojo.

H3nbC71eaa	My opinion is that WWE has been going through a transition, or a build up year. They are trying to build up and find new wrestlers who can carry the company in the near future.<br>  They've had good and bad PPV's, but for the most part it has been ok at best this year. But the positive is that they are looking for future stars and fresh faces.|`|XDuo03wEaa	2008: WWE 2008 Kicked off with the Royal Rumble. First off all they should still have New Years Revlution. Genrally they have signed new and upcoming Superstars that may build the business in the near future. But still this year it lacks the PPV Rating ans storyline. They have PPV'S That have all three brands. I like it when One brand would own that PPV. And they have had bad luck on building up Matches and big time PPV'S (e.g. Batista vs Jericho). And now that Ric Flair is gone well he was a Legend so I don't know why they made him quit until this year. Plus with the in ring return of Chris Jericho & JBL They have really brang back the some superstars from the Old days (1997-2005) And plus the The Undertaker and Edge rivalry ended in Hell In a Cell that was a good match. And yeah thats about it.<br>  <br>  Overall Rating of 2008: 6.4/10<br>  <br>  2007: 6.7/10<br>  <br>  2006: 7.1/10<br>  <br>  2005: 8.8/10<br>  <br>  2004: 8.9/10<br>  <br>  2003: 9/10<br>  <br>  2002: 9.2/10<br>  <br>  2001: 9.8/10<br>  <br>  2000: 9.9/10<br>  <br>  1999: 10/10 (Great time I got stuck into Wrestling)|`|ePvvGUu3aa	It was above average to an extent of good. The main event matches of Pay Per Views, most of them delivered, which is a good thing. Raw has had it's bad weeks, while ECW and SmackDown improved. If there were no injuries that happened, I'm sure it would have been much better. Did have major flaws with some booking, but I'll accept it because they seem to make mistakes all the time. Overall, it did better than last year and again, above average to an extent of good.|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	Some matches are good while some are not, also some of the storylines seem to not make sense im happy that Y2J finally have another world title reign and it's good that they are pushing young talents like Evan Bourne.|`|AA10065077	My opinion is people need to stop getting injured. This year has been bad year. Also people need to start complying with the wellness policy. There have been some great wrestlers like D.H. Smith that could have been used instead they have to take a backseat. Despite the injuries I need to say that it has been average. I know that storylines need to change etc when people get hurt. Also make Jeff Hardy a champ already. He deserves it.|`|55LcBlIraa	It's improving. And I believe the company as a whole will be just a bit better next year. Starting with the royal rumble. <br>  <br>  Rest your guys WWE so they can have better quality matches on TV.<br>  <br>  WM24 was a good spectacle. some matches could have been better (why another triple threat match? im sick of seeing triple threat matches as the wm main event), in my opinion, they really screwed up what could have been an awesome wm main event with cena/orton, but instead they made it a match at NWO and it ended up being horrible... the double elim chamber concept was decent and it came out good in the end.... championship scramble? eh... could have done without em, but the idea would have been good just for the world heavyweight title..... keep jeff hardy away from the WWE title, im not a fan of placing the title on him just yet, maybe have him win the royal rumble (eliminating edge or jericho or cena) and main event wm25 for the wwe title or win money in the bank and cash it in at summerslam or somethin, but not anytime soon.....<br>  <br>  taker vs hhh on smackdown was WAY too soon, as was Edge vs HHH (GAB i believe, after trips got 'drafted'), but the match was off the chain and surprisingly, im kind of glad the match ended the way it did without a clean finish.. save the clean finish for WM 25 *evil laugh*..<br>  <br>  CM punk was definitely a breath of fresh air, (having him beat JBL cleanly a couple times, defeatin batista, kane, and tag team champ)...<br>  <br>  Cryme tyme (need i say more? come on, its cryme tyme, and they are good in the ring)<br>  <br>  miz and morrison (better as a tag team, may have morrison make a run at the ecw title with a miz distraction, he'll win it..... eh, royal rumble 09 idea lol)<br>  <br>  I don't like triple H as a face. He needs to turn heel and get back to being the bad ***, but with the WWE being so comic book-like now, catering MORE to the younger audience in their transitional period, its better to have him as a face for now (when he was a heel, he was able to do more damage with his sledgehammer, more blood, more etc etc)...<br>  <br>  and i still don't understand what it is about these followers who don't like cena... i mean i swear most of them don't like him because someone else doesn't... he's one of the hardest workin people in the business and he makes u watch him every week (trust me, you do)<br>  <br>  i know this was long, but this was a long year and i forgot A LOT of things (flair...... nuff said)|`|mWXKwjf4aa	It got worse as it went on. One thing that has improved of late is Smackdown and ECW though, but with Evan Bourne's injury, ECW have to find another draw (Perhaps Tommy Dreamer vs Jack Swagger in a hardcore match?).|`|V1e80s7aaa	It ****** sucks if u want 2 watch a new show watch WTE my fantasy show its the 1st show which goes for 3 hours and WWE sucks like Santino Marella come on u need a real champ like orton punk or kofi not santino and he cant even beat his gf Beth phoneix|`|D8jcgdcpaa	Its good.

AA11528760	Even though the belt is larger than the the original, it doesn't carry the hardcore nature of the original ECW. It looks more like a show-off thing.<br>  But actually Vince is right in getting the new title because WWE's ECW is so far away from being exteme that it doesn't deserve the original title belt. IMO, Vince should've rather re-created NITRO instead of disgracing the EC FN' W.<br>  <br>  And BTW, MVP is the most underrated right now.|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	I prefer the old design it's more classic and the new one is crap WTF is Vince thinking making the title silver instead of gold? That shows he's destroying the legacy of "hardcore wrestling" ECW. <br>  <br>  Shelton Benjamin is very underrated he really needs a World title run so what if he doesn't have great mic skills i care more about his wrestling skills and he impressed me.|`|XDuo03wEaa	WHATT!!!<br>  <br>  It looks like Trash found in the dump:<br>  The new ECW Championship & WWE Divas Championship are worthless and have reuined the tradition of World Wrestling Entertainment (AKA WWF)|`|VRsTuRz9aa	i dont like it on matt, i think its alright on mark though. i prefer hardy as champion though.<br>  <br>  dunno whos the most underated.<br>  <br>  Im Just Sayin....|`|S42yzY99aa	Well since ECW is not ECW anymore, the title fits.

NkkYk6T6aa	Yes indeed, Samurai Evans, I totally agree with you! This makes perfect sense!...|`|AA10065077	I agree wrestling today is sad. Even Cyber Sunday was predictable and fans got to "vote". Vince is to far in the money right now. Remember when dealing with his promotion the term "wrestler, wrestling, superstar, or sports entertainment" can not be used. He just wants it to be entertainment. That might explain how predictable it has become yet again.|`|wk47fHs4aa	IM ABOUT TO STOP WATCHING WWE IT SUCKS NOW|`|FY8YYZgBaa	You sir are CORRECT!|`|vix2q6mKaa	vince's head is inside the money, so he doesn't care about the predictableness of the matches. it's sad these days.|`|5864fJdSaa	the wwe as of today is sad. it was the best wrestling promotion ever, now it is just so boring. last friday i changed the channel because smackdown was so boring! every thing is predictable, including last nights cyber sunday. we all knew triple h was going to retain ( to my dismay). the wwe wouldn't let a newbie like evan bourne win the ecw championship. it is so overrated. i wouldn't pay to see stuff i know is going to happen. this is a really good question, thank you.|`|kmeddhR1aa	I know exactly what you mean and the PPVs are even worse.

2pqUziBGaa	I like HBK he's been wrestling a long time but he is 43 years old. He's not old but it's time for him retire that's for sure the same with The Undertaker. They are both 43 they look like their in pain most of time and I think they need to hang it up. They both had a great run in the WWE and their legends. I don't want to see them end up like Ric Flair and retiring at nearly 60.|`|RpsbIXDsaa	i dont think he should retire i think he should have a break and let his body heal and prolly update his gimmick or something just relax so when he comes back he will be better, honestly i like HBK one of my favourite stars but i dont like him now lately he's becoming too boring and predictable i liked him when he has attitude when he was a heel remember when he went heel for hogan how awesome was that that is what i wanted to see but then he went back to being face, so no i dont think he should retire i think he should take a break and then come back.|`|AA10065077	Look how old Ric Flaire is. He was still wrestling. I think Shawn should retire when he feels the need to.|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	HBK will not be retiring at WM25,  He is a good five or six years before he retires.  And that came straight from Shawn|`|WZDJXXMXaa	No. I don't think Shawn should retire. He has been in wrestling for a long time. True. But he is the best. Just because he is in his 40's doesn't mean he s old. He is in great shape. He may some old injuries that bother him at times, but all of them do. HBK will keep wrestling until he is made to retire. He will go out just like Ric Flair, A True Legend.|`|32CXaMd8aa	Well, you cant really say any type of pattern has developed merely because of something that happened on ONE Raw (or two, or three..) It's called a story-line, and right now, HBK's story-line is to play the older, beat-up, veteran who may REALLY be hurt...or may NOT really be hurt at all.  Remember, even the Great Y2J has proclaimed HBK to be the greatest faker in Wrestling History.  Yeah, he got beat up a bit tonight, but yeah, he also still made it out to ring-side and actually helped in the win. The story-line says his ribs are now hurt somehow, but when the ref pulled HBK off Jericho, he wrapped both arms right around HBK's chest (where his ribs are..) pulled him off with force, and HBK did not wince at all.  Its another work.  I'd like to see his activity reduced, if it means he'll win more often when he DOES wrestle, but fact is, the guy LOVES to wrestle, whether hes winning, losing, or merely Stopping Da Show, as he has SOOOO many times in the past.  He will retire, dont worry.  Whenever he is ready to. o.-|`|XDuo03wEaa	Not just yet. I think he will fued with JBL @ Survivor series and then at Wrestlemania 25 he will retire as a World Champion. But maybe not he is the same age as The Undertaker so i don't have a clue?<br>  <br>  I'm more interested in if Shane and Stephanie Mcmahon fire Adamle next week if they don't then Randy Orton leaves the WWE|`|tgVGE2Umaa	He will keep going until he is forced to leave probably just like Ric Flair was 'forced' to leave in an I quit match. He is the HBK he won't stop until it kills him.|`|D6mN3Frqaa	He will at WM 25

Australia requires you to have a special license just like for owning a handgun.  The UK has also gone to something like this as well.  In the United States they don't but the laws are such that you can not just carry it around with you all the time or just anywhere.  Here in the US you can transport it to and from a place of study or where a cultural event is taking place but most places require you to do so with it in your trunk in some kind of a case or bag.  Also the burden of proof is on you if you are stopped or pulled over by the police so it pays to be smart about such things and not draw attention to yourself or it when you have it with you.  I always transport my weapons in a case in the trunk (except for my staff since they are too long for the trunk) and never just leave them in there all the time.|`|PfQOqlLhaa	it varies from state to state, check your state laws. most web sites will tell you they cant ship to certain states. now if your state does allow such weapons. you can transport(by car i know, plain not to sure) them from site to site but the have to remain sheath until inside.  |`|6nGII584aa	is it sharp if not i dont think you should have any problems with it unless you take it outside into public view.|`|DdUmku2oaa	Yes, don't use them on someone

Always wrap up with arms. And always, always drive through with legs.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	I used to focus on my opponents core. No matter what way he tries to fake or which way his legs go his core will always be stable. As safety I would give a little space then when my opponent would go up for the ball to turn to catch the pass I would use my legs and drive my shoulder into his midsection. Front or back doesn't matter as long as I hit him in the middle. From there I could dump him or carry him like a sack of flower and then dump him.<br>  Hope this helps.

VaWy3DKoaa	Congratulations! Running a marathon is like nothing else, you find out what you're really made of when you hit mile 18-20. I decided I wanted to run one 4 years ago, and I trained from not being able to run 3 miles to running the entire marathon. Since then I've made it a point to run one every year, and I just started training for my next one.<br>  <br>  To be quite honest, finishing a marathon isn't accomplished at a gym. Your training should involve very little work with weights, and it should involve a lot of stretching and running =).  You gotta make running fun, because you'll be doing a lot of it. The shoe+ipod sync is a good idea, at very least invest in a small mp3 player of some kind and an armband. Make sure you have comfortable clothes. Not necessarily expensive or high-tech, but they need to feel good. No chafing. You'll need to do a lot of outdoor running, so find some areas in your neighborhood that you feel comfortable with. Quiet streets, parks, hills, keep it varied to keep you from boredom. Check out googlemap pedometers to find how long your courses are.<br>  <br>  Set a realistic goal for yourself as far as finishing. If you have never run before, with proper training you can probably finish without walking if you wanted. If you have been a pretty good runner your whole life, then set a realistic time based on your ability. At very least be honest with yourself on how long you can run, and factor some possible walking time in your marathon plan. <br>  <br>  Running can be very therapeutic, use the time to sort through problems in your life, people, money, whatever worries you. Let the stress feed your legs to keep running. About halfway through the endorphins will kick in and your problems will dissappear.<br>  <br>  I would suggest investing in a subscription to Runners World. They have some very good articles. Don't buy in to all their ads though- you don't need to buy 110$ shoes to run. What you do need is some comfortable shoes that breathe and aren't worn out. Buy a new pair now, or if you have relatively new pair use them until about 2 months before the marathon day, then buy a new pair from the same brand, possibly even the same shoe. I've never paid more then 40$ for running shoes and I've been relatively injury free for the past 3 marathons.<br>  <br>  As far as diet, you want to eat the same or less total fat, more protein, and way more carbohydrates. Your body can't burn fat without carbohydrates, so make sure that you never skip a meal. Your diet should be about 70-75% carbs, 20-25% protein, and at most 10% fat. Meals need to be timed to coincide with your training program. Never eat a large meal within 2-3 hours of a run, and only very light snack within an hour of a run. On the other hand, make sure you HAVE eaten within 5 hours of a run. If not you'll lack energy and won't run well. Also, breakfast is key. If you are a breakfast eater, keep it up. If not make sure you at least have a decent sized meal within an hour or an hour and a half of waking up. THe meal should be 3 parts carbs to 1 part protein, and no fat. Bacon, sausage, fried potatoes, hash browns, are not good choices. Basically no fast food in the morning.<br>  <br>  You'll learn a lot more as your training progresses.

QfvmFbVSaa	You can try the taulk powder like has been advised but here are a couple more things you can try<br>  1 try some rough sand paper to give more grip <br>  2 buy some tennis racket grip tape and wrap your escrimas you can even change the colors<br>  3 they actualy make a spray in an aerosol can that when you spray it on your hands it maes them sticky. <br>  4 just try some hair spray that will make them sticky enough<br>  I hope this helps you cause when escrimas are done right its a beautiful art, when done wrong you can get one hell of a knot on your head or a broke fingure|`|YDpT2ClBaa	the weapon is an extension of your body.<br>  <br>  one aspect of the grip and an important one is your pinky finger (little finger),<br>  this finger controls the major muscle in your fore arm. and controls the tighting of that muscle. so keep your pinky tight<br>  <br>  take one hand and put it on your fore arm make a fist with the pinky loss and than with it tight you will see what i'm talking about then. this is important for empty hand as well as any weapoon.|`|nRBC4E5saa	Chalk up your hands, perhaps?

AA11806777	wow, you love the sport of baseball/softball, and i'm a huge fan too, not quite that obsessive though.........ha, but good luck to you in your future career, sound like you really love the game and there needs to be players who do love the game that much|`|DkiTfLVDaa	Keep practicing and keep in shape. Don't forget to take a week or two off every once in a while, just to get your body rested and you can keep pushing your workouts to the maximum. Tell your coaches what your goals are and have them help you. Go to camps and clinics that coaches put on. Fill out questionairres for the university's softball team.<br>  <br>  I was in your shoes once (being completely softball crazy) but trust me, there is SO much more to life than ball.|`|LM4NOfV8aa	As a freshman your first softball concentration should be to try and make your varsity team. But with that being said you want to make sure that your a "fit" for the team aspect of the game and not going to be a benchwarmer which does happen to most freshman that make a varsity squad. Otherwise concentrate on JV ball, take strength and agility training sessions where affordable and work real hard on your grades. A scout will not follow you until about age 16. They are not allowed to even talk with you. So work hard at first on all of the above.
AA10270018	You should beat all of them up. I know you can. You must be confident, don't listen to all those negative advices. You are a winner. If you been lifting weight for 8 years then you must be pretty strong. I am certain you can beat me up. Five guys but you only have to beat the leader then the rest will run.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	the best option is not to fight. and just walk away<br>  if anything call the police, although it may make thinks worst the next time you see them<br>  <br>  if they do attack you make sure the first 2 people that come at <br>  that many people is possible. but it's a question of the tactics you use and your skills.<br>  in situations dealing with multiple opponents it is always better to walk away.<br>  <br>  you never know what kind of weapons they will be pulling out during the fight.|`|26b727784ab6c6917ee0c334293b7446aa	Can you win a fight with just brute strength?<br>  <br>  Oh sure; if you're Spiderman, the Incredible Hulk, Superman, hell Super GIRL.....  I'm sure you can think of a few.<br>  <br>  Alright illustrating a point; relying on brute force is pretty dumb, because the human body has limits, first of all, second, the strength difference between people roughly in the same age group is never that great.  You would need to be overwhelmingly strong to take on 5 people at once, and by overlwhemingly I mean, able to tip over a car by lifting its side, all on your own.<br>  <br>  Grizzly bears I know, have been known to do that, but, then, they have the physical strength of 4 NFL linemen.  Grizzlies don't just have the strength of 4 men; they have the strength of 4 BIG, and VERY STRONG men.  Also bears are not just strong because they are big; they have an incredibly dense muscular structure, and an incredibly thick bone structure so thick in fact, that primitive native americans used to use bear bones as weapons of war.  Additionally, bears have low muscle insertions; if you lift weights you know what I'm talking about but, to illustrate.<br>  <br>  Some people have long tendons, other people have short tendons, the people with short tendons tend to have greater strength, because a shorter tendon is thicker and therefore less likely to snap, it provides greater tensile strength.  This is one of the Charles Poliquin principles of power lifting.  The reason bears are so strong, is because they have not only the shortest and thickest tendons in the animal kingdom among mammals, they also have the densest muscles in fact, while such an encounter is unlikely, bears are so strong, they could probably tear apart a large crocodile.<br>  <br>  No joke, stay the hell away from grizlies and listen to ALL survival tips given by guides because those animals can literally rip you apart.  In terms of physical strength in the animal world, as strength is measured proportionate to the animal's size, the humble ant ranks at number one, as it can lift many times its size.  Next on the list, the bear, and after that, the lion, and after the lion, the Jaguar.  Okay never mind I'm wrong, excluding insects, as thinking about it all insects are strong; within the mammalian world, the bear is king in terms of physical strength.  Followed by the lion, and after that, followed by the jaguar of latin america.  How strong is a jaguar?  Remember that crocodile story I told you about?  Even though a Jaguar is probably only around 4 feet long, standing at 2.5 to 3 feet tall at the shoulders, and weighs at most 200 lbs, it has been known to kill alligators and crocodiles that grow to lengths of 20 feet, and weight close to 800 lbs.<br>  <br>  To put it into perspective, that is like Manny Paquiao fighting Bob Sapp and hitting him all over so hard, Sapp dies of internal injuries.  Its scary how strong animals are but hey, that is why they are called "animals."<br>  <br>  Here is what you could do, if worst came to worst though; you will have to use your wrestling skills, but make it a point to outleverage the turds, and DO NOT go to the ground if it can be helped as you will likely get kicked in the head.  Use your wrestling defensively, to get them off you whenever possible, and if you manage to pick one up, to throw them using, again, leverage.  Such a display of strength would deter the other attackers; however it is strength used strategically, against only one guy, not brute force of you going all Superman and overwhelming them because you can't, even if you are well trained yourself.<br>  <br>  Word of the wise buddy it is best that you do that only if you don't have a choice; in prison I've heard stories that even buff, strong guys can get raped, no one is immune, as prison rapists always travel in packs.  The reason that is, is because criminals, who have often been in a few fights, know full well that even when its a big man attempting the rape, few straight guys out there will willingly take a d*ck up their *** without a fight.  Because they expect a fight, that is why they travel in groups.<br>  <br>  A word of caution; use your strength and wits if you have no choice, as to how they apply to your wrestling skills, but keep in mind that you are neither bear, lion, jaguar or panther.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|v1mbL56caa	Yes the best stance in a street fight is someplace else. If you are ever in a fight with multiple assailants wrestling moves are not going to help much. While taking one down the others will be kicking your brains out. If you are a reasonably good stand up fighter than your best tactic is to defeat them one at a time. You can do this only by keeping them lined up in front of you as best as you can. You can not take them on more than one at a time so keep them bunched up in front of you. Use the closest one as a shield or a weapon. If you are a strong guy throw the smaller opponents at the others. Attack attack and keep them responding to you once you are responding to their moves it is time to run.|`|4hVeNk4Raa	If they gang on you, I'd go for the biggest guy first, and try knock him out in the first hit.<br>  <br>  But if I had a choice between not fighting or not, I wouldn't. 5 people is just way too much, 2 on 1 is hard enough. Be the bigger guy and let the idiots screw their lives up and don't let them drag you down with them. You'd get in big trouble for fighting them unless it was self-defense.|`|PDa0proCaa	A quick temper will only make a fool of yourself - Bruce Lee<br>  <br>  Fighting should only be the last solution, if you really have to fight dont think you have to win just think you dont have to lose, Think quick, act quick and be quick.|`|dmX3zwbHaa	You could win if you are trained in some  standing fight art (kickbox, thai...) not when you are a beginner but if you have some years of experience. In your situation i would not recomment it.|`|AA12129598	First of all, you had the option to walk away and you used it. That was the most intelligent thing to do. I applaud this and I know it is a sign of an honorable man. I am sure your ego wanted you to tear all those guys into pieces. <br>  Could you have done it?<br>  Well, that depends on a lot of variables. In the right conditions, maybe. The problem is the loss of life factor, someone would be gravely injured possibly killed. Be it you or one of them. Brute strength diminishes 90% after the first couple of seconds. Adrenaline makes your energy dump out know matter how strong you are.<br>  In a situation where you have no other option but to face 5 attackers you have to use every advantage, know  the environment, try to limit their ability to flank your rear. There are just so many variables. If it is just a pack of fools then locate the alpha and take him out. Of course it all depends on the given situation. I mean if was a no holds barred situation and your life or your families lives depended on it and you used every advantage you may be able to pull it off but not with strength alone. <br>  But you did the smart thing, self-preservation is the ultimate goal.<br>  I may have called the authorities, I am sure the local officers would love to met these young gentleman to talk to them about public intoxication.<br>  The police rely on everyone to be the eyes and ears of the community.<br>  With our wonderful cell phone culture we are Big Brother.<br>  |`|FMEHpZZFaa	Best option is not to fight. And the answer to  your question in No- brute strength can not always help you win fights. Most of the time fights are won by the individual that keeps his cool and can out think his opponent. Besides if they had been drinking alcohol you would have had a much tougher time. Alcohol can numb people besides slow the reflexes. You would probably have needed to cause a lot more damage than you would have wanted to putting them down. <br>  Just  let it go. Use fighting as an absolute last resort and keep your cool. What they shout is nothing more than an opinion and everyone has one of those. Don't let it get to you.|`|cgXLwLkNaa	5 person...one go for your legs,another one go for your eyes,another one go for your ribs,another one go at the back of your head,and the other one just getting ready to support the other 4 person...so you have 2 arms and two legs to either defend and attack at the same time...so do you think logically you can win????if all attack at the same time with all of the above strategic plan...maybe you need a charm, luck or maybe god will send angel of death to help you?this is only example if they attack you bare handed without weapons...you make the smart move not to confront them....never underestimate your opponent especially if they are in a large group....10 arms and legs with 5 human brains and reflex attacking one huge human being...what do yuo think?unless you have superhuman strength?|`|qQiOtyuzaa	Only way I could see for it to be possible to fight 5 on 1 would be to cause them to all be lined up, in an area where they can't surround you. <br>  <br>  Even then, it'd still be difficult. You might have more strength that them, but what about endurance? If you tire out during a fight and some of em are still fresh...well, you'll probably be in trouble, then.<br>  <br>  And what if one of them had a knife or something? Doesn't take much strength to cut someone <br>  <br>  You did the smart thing by staying away from them. Might not've felt great about it, but you'd feel alot worse if  you're were getting beaten up/killed. |`|vToaRondaa	it sounds like you walked away which was the best thing that you could have done be proud of that.  I think many people will remember reading articles of people who fight 3 or more people and end in the hospital, jail, or worse some of those will be quoted as saying that they won the fight but have no prize to show but for scars and lost teeth.  In the US you have an obligation to walk away if you can or you will go to jail.  as for beating multiple opponents you won't win by brute force if there are more they will win, if you try to wrestle them to the ground one of them will kick you in the head.  there is a way but it is not the hollywood method of fancy moves but rather deadly force in precise areas|`|hxVuvoP8aa	alright. so first off. never walk into a confrontation. if you can leave, then leave, you dont know if one of them has a weapon or something.<br>  <br>  but. if they start attacking you anyways. then fight back. use crowd control. do not use your wrestling moves unless they are going at you one at a time. in a streetfight with more than one other person, you do not want to go to the ground. if you go on the ground with the other person, his friends are gonna surround you and start kicking your head and punching you. so first off, since peoples bodys take up space, usually the maximum number of people that can attack you at once is 4. you cant use a bunch of super complicated moves in a situation like that. and, you probably couldnt beat them with brute strength either. you need to throw short punches at them, do not **** back your arm and throw haymaker punches, throw only short fast punches, you can utilize your elbows, elbow strikes, use your knees, and do this as fast as possible, you can drop them on the ground if you can, and then move on to the next person, if theyre all getting too close to you, push them away and attack the other. Check your strength though, you dont wanna hurt them too bad or else you might run into some legal trouble later.<br>  <br>  oh yeah. theres a closequarters self defense style called Krav Maga, you might wanna check that out, maybe take classes or something|`|rGJc7KoVaa	The best option is always to let it be, trust me, just suck it up and let it pass. Even if you gave it to them this one time, one or two might be back with knives another time..ive seen it happen.<br>  <br>  With groups you have to move, circle and go in and out, quick attacks. Only try to take one or two at a time, keeping the rest behind, by circling and moving right? You also need accuracy, you should at least daze one with each punch (or kick), high school kids are prone to cry n back off after one shot, shouldnt be too hard ;o)<br>  <br>  Which ever you decide, stay safe kiddo..<br>  |`|be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	You are dreaming , wake up .|`|zZjgLhRWaa	only an armature would choose to fight in a situation like that.<br>  you dont know how good they are at fighting, or if they have any weapons.<br>  it is better to walk away from this situation.

If you don't like doing it, you'll not go very far. 2) Look at the quality of the instructors you have in your area.<br>  <br>  Some of the things to look at are, will the MA teach you to stop an attack, strike, enter into a control for joint locks, etc. Something like brazilian jujitsu while a very good style, may not be useful if all learn to do is end up on the ground. Same could be said boxing if you never learn to control.<br>  <br>  You will want something that offers variety, balance and understanding. <br>  The main thing is do something you enjoy for the long haul. All the other parts can be added later.<br>  |`|FMEHpZZFaa	My favorite is Hapkido. It works with joint locks and body mechanics to control the attacking individual. It along with some grappling techniques are taught to police officers by my instructor who regualarly conducts seminars for the local police force.|`|SX5kxeUbaa	Yes.
9YE45U9Laa	Hang in there!<br>  Shihan J and Sifufrank both had some good points. As you already know it is a challenge when you 'break away'. My suggestions would be:<br>  1) Start small- too many in your situation try to rent a huge place and find six months down the line they can't afford the overhead. It doesn't matter if you're in a two car garage, outside or where ever  if your students like how you teach they will keep coming then when you have grown to the point where you can comfortably afford a larger site then and only then move.<br>  <br>  2) Organize-    I can't stress this enough weather it is on the computer or on your desk make folders, One for a student list, One for bills, One for the buisness plan etc. often times half your stress will come from not being able to find things this will alleviate that.<br>  <br>  3) Make yourself a tickler file- This is one I suggest you do not do on the computer. It will help you keep up with things more than almost anything else. You probably talk to people several times a day and say ok I'll do that for you, then get busy and like most of us things slip by. The tickler file will stop that if you use it. First get a box of manila folders, your going to need one for each month, and one for each day of the week. How you use it is this you keep your weekly folders inside the monthly folder you are in (yes you can make weekly folders for all months if you like) and when you talk to someone and make a promise to do something on such and such a date, make a note and put it in the folder for that day or earlier if you need time to get whatever it is accomplished. Check the folder without fail every morning you will find a lot less is 'falling through the cracks'<br>  <br>  3)  Standardize- what you are doing and make rank test lists and get started on writing a manual. Nothing will confuse students more than not being sure what they need to do to learn and advance. The manual is more for you and your Black Belts. The lists say up to green or brown belt should be openly available for students. You can even make little packets up at Kinkos with the list and the forms, exercises printed out for each rank and either give them to a student when they are promoted or sell them at a minimum to cover your cost on them.<br>  <br>  4)  Barter-  I am sure in your student base you have students that have the skills you need, you mentioned Logo's etc ask around and see if someone has the computer skills to do one for you in exchange for a private lesson or a months lessons etc. same goes if your site needs to be painted, cleaned etc. You will find students love to help you as long as they don't feel taken advantage of. If no one has the skills run an ad on Craigslist offering lessons for whatever the service is.<br>  <br>  5)  Your local office supply has a large supply of generic forms to help with everything from bookeeping to billing etc go take a look use the ones you need.<br>  <br>  6)  Get some help- you should have a student or two that is willing to help with the right skill set if not teach them, usually all you need is an hour or two a day a couple days a week. Offer reduced a price on lessons or whatever works for you.<br>  <br>  7)  Affiliation-  These days you are lucky there are tons of associations out there looking for members, take a look on the web find one that feels right to you. I personally don't feel the need but many do, one thing to look for is if they offer conventions, seminars, get togethers for sharing knowledge etc. .<br>  <br>  8)  Insurance-  Very important one accident can bankrupt you. Look up martial arts insurance on the web.<br>  <br>  Hope some of these ideas help, I've been there too.<br>  Good Luck|`|v1mbL56caa	Starting a small business is always a tremendous effort. For help and advertising class plans etc try joining MTA Martial arts teachers association. Insurance is affordable, personal liability is a necessity. Start small and think big. If you can start when the weather is warm and you can do a lot of classes outside to avoid paying rent. You can also try the YMCA and run some classes there. The YMCA has a course for personal fitness instructors I believe. Many get a start that way. As you get known and have a large enough student base you may want to than invest in a store front lease. As for rank testing for yourself check around. <br>  Please don't bad mouth your former school. It always sounds like sour grapes and will reflct back badly on you. The school I teach and train at is a break away from annother as well. It has been a long hard road to just keep a viable school up and running. It can work and can be a rewarding experience. Don't lose heart.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Terrible break man, but remember that since you broke away you can not use the curriculum unless they give you permission or you could be looking at a law suit.<br>  Look at it this way... it is an opportunity to expand your knowledge. Good news is that since you already hold instructor rank you may be able to talk an instructor into giving you the fast track on learning a new system.<br>  Good Luck.|`|CIs4sdM4aa	yes, it was a TERRIBLE break. go back to martial arts.<br>  <br>  from a ginger-spasian.<br>  peace.|`|z0j7CRhaaa	My grandmaster broke away from his taekwondo club a couple of years ago to start his own. Basically, you need a team of people who knows what they are doing to help you. In terms of getting degrees your rank its probably a problem of getting your name out there more, getting involved with the organizations.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	you can always train under someone else to get rank.<br>  <br>  as for starting from scratch a new school. i would recommend to state at a community center or a Y, build up a good amount of students, and then open up your own place. you will loose about half in the move but you wont be starting from zero at least. it will also give you a chance to finish all your paper work, get some ma supplier companies together for equipment. and any thing else.<br>  also with the center you don't have to purchase all your own equipment, you can use there's. and purchase your own little be little instead of one lump sum. it's a lot easier on the pocket that way|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	go for it just make sure that you know what you are doing and make sure that your students can afford it

Zcj52jDtaa	I say yes.  Martinez has a great bat and can lift up ur Avg. up to 30 points.  U can greatly benefit from this along with his HR and RBI.  Yes, u do lose a starring ace in Verlander, but the rest of ur pitching staff can pick up the load, especially down the stretch in contending teams.  Ur KKK's will still be awesome with CC and Bedard leading the way.  Lackey will get u Wins as well as lowering the ERA dept.  I know u muddle with the lost of Verlander, but u'll be getting great trade in return.  GO 4 IT!!!|`|AA12197868	Yes, <br>  <br>  Victor is hitting the ball well now and he's better than McCann.  Verlander is not the same pitcher he was earlier this year.|`|LeQp4EN7aa	i wouldnt do it|`|SV7dNiTXaa	unless it's a keeper league i would do it.  you have lots of good pitching and verlander seems to be running out of steam a little.|`|bNlYFkB3aa	I say no... <br>  <br>  1.) You're lineup is already too reliant on the Indians hitting with Garko, Peralta & Hafner. <br>  <br>  2.) McCann has got both Chipper & Andrew hitting well, and they just acquired Tiexiera from Texas, which puts McCann in a good hitting lineup better increasing his odds at producing RBI's.<br>  <br>  3.) At the same time in that trade, ATL got rid of Salmachhia-whatever his name is, which makes McCann full-time catcher.<br>  <br>  Today so far, McCann is 2 for 2 with 1 BB, 1 RBI & 1 Run.|`|AA10034577	You have plenty strong pitching and having an offensive Catcher never hurts.

1luRrZyqaa	Leg trip<br>   <br>  Usage of a leg trip to perform a takedown.Leg trip (depending on type also known as a leg sweep) refers to a technique in which the combatant performing the leg trip uses his or her own leg(s) to off-balance an opponent, hence causing the opponent to fall to the ground. Leg trips are often integrated into more complex takedown techniques, and are also important in many throws. Takedown techniques that are pure leg trips usually involve controlling the body of the opponent, and impeding or destabilizing one or both of the opponents legs. Leg trips are featured in for instance Freestyle wrestling, Judo, Sumo, and Shuai Jiao while being an illegal technique in Greco-Roman wrestling[1].<br>  <br>  The scissor kick takes down an opponent by wrapping one's legs around the opponent.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Single leg takedown<br>   <br>  A single leg takedown attempt.The single leg takedown (often shortened to single leg or single) involves grabbing one of the legs of the opponent, usually with both hands, and using the position to force the opponent to the ground. Typically, the lower part of the leg is pulled in one direction, while the torso or shoulder is used to press the body or upper part of the leg of the opponent in the other direction. There are several varieties of single leg takedowns. Some hold the leg by the ankle and are often known as ankle picks, while other varieties include high crotch, which hold the leg high up in the crotch area. Single leg takedowns can also be executed in combination with a leg trip to the other leg, which additionally destabilizes the opponent. Single leg takedowns can be countered by sprawling, and, where allowed, in combination with knee strikes to the head of the opponent. [2]<br>  <br>  In Judo and other martial arts, there are many classifications of different types of single leg takedowns. Variants of the high crotch correspond to sukui-nage (掬投, "scoop throw"[3]), where the opponent is lifted up from the ground[4], while the typical forward pushing single leg takedown is classified as morote-gari[5] (双手刈, "both hands scoop"[3]) (similarly to certain double leg takedowns). Some techniqes are more specific, for instance kibisu-gaeshi (踵返, "heel trip reversal"[3]), which is an ankle pick where the heel is grabbed, scooped up and the opponent is pushed and thrown immediately. In kuchiki-taoshi (朽木落, "one hand drop"[6]), the opponent's leg is grabbed, pulled up, and used to push the opponent down to the ground in a split second[7].<br>  <br>   <br>  Double leg takedown.<br>  [edit] Double leg takedown<br>  The double leg takedown (colloquially simply known as a double leg or even double) involves grabbing the opponent with both arms around the opponent's legs while keeping the chest close to the opponent, and using this position to force the opponent to the ground. There are several varieties of forcing the opponent to the ground, such as lifting and slamming, or pushing forward with the shoulder while pulling the opponent's legs. The double leg takedown can be countered similarly to a single leg takedown, by sprawling, moving away, and/or striking. The Guillotine choke is also a good counter to a poorly performed double leg takedown. [8]<br>  <br>  The double leg takedown is in Judo also referred to as morote-gari[5], although some hold that a double leg takedown where the opponent is lifted into the air or swept sideways should be referred to as sukui-nage[5]. Morote-gari, despite having been used by judokas for a very long time and being approved of by Jigoro Kano himself, was not accepted until 1982 by the Kodokan[5] as an official Judo technique, and there is still some dismissal among certain traditionalists|`|NY2N8byTaa	a few people might be training, yeah ..<br>  Sorry but IDK any ..|`|Ay2z73Eyaa	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...<br>  <br>  <br>  nope|`|WHikQ5PGaa	My friend is a real independent wrestler, but hes new and still kinda sucks at it my other friend is a referee. <br>  the best takedown i know is when i punch somebody's mofo lights out...i luv it|`|d71392a8d7aafb5823c7f35357002dd0aa	Simple:<br>  <br>  Belly-to-back takedown.

73005772047668391bb3ee6a5ceba354aa	I'd say great running backs.  Gore and Maroney are both in my top 8 and both should have great seasons.  Barber is an excellent #3 or bye week guy that could start if someone gets injuried.<br>  <br>  Your wide recievers are top notch with Holt, Hous and Driver (second most targeted reciever in the league and is not overrated, Holt was the most targeted)...all will do well, and Clayton is normally a starter on most fantasy teams (so good depth).<br>  <br>  Romo is a good starting quaterback when you focus on WR and RB to begin the draft.  He has tons of potential and won't disappoint with a great o-line and recievers.  Pennington is an average backup and is okay for a bye week back up (you may wait until the season starts and try to pick up the best waiver QB if you don't like Pennington.  There are tons of QBs that could emerge like Garcia, Losman, Delhomme, McNair and dare I say Grossman).<br>  <br>  TE/K/DEF - all are average, and good enough players (Miami's defense is not that bad...47 sacks and 27 turnovers beat a lot of fantasy teams last year, and they still have Taylor and Thomas...and it what world would the Pats defense be on the waiver in any league?).  I think Crumpler's stats will be a little worse this year without Vick.  Atlanta's offense in general will be worse and Horn is going to be Harrington's go to guy, not Crumpler.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think you have a very good team.  You have the running backs to compete and the WRs to shine.  If Romo can keep up with the top 5 QBs, you will blow away the competition.  <br>  <br>  I predict in a 10 or more league, that you are fantasy champ and in an 8 or smaller league, it depends on how much talent LTs, Manning and S. Jackson's team has.  But really good draft.|`|YkuXyrZmaa	Meh to your Qb's. Good RBs. Decent WRs. Nice grab with Holt. Driver= most overrated WR in the league. TE: I like Crumpler. Does anyone really care for kickers? Better to pick a defense too early in a draft then be stuck with Miami.<br>  <br>  Lose Pennington and pick up someone else. Trade away Driver. Someone in your league will be enough a smuck to give you something decent for him. And for the love of GOD! Lose Miami. Pick up another Defense. Then you might make it to the playoffs. Sadly you'll lose to the guy who has LT.<br>  <br>  QBs: B+<br>  RBs: A- Sure they're solid, but you don't have LT<br>  WRs: B+ Driver's bringing you down, but he's so overrated some idiot might actually trade you if you play it cool.<br>  TE: A Other then getting Gates this is pretty good. Crumpler is always solid<br>  K: A<br>  Def: F Dude. If you want any hope of winning for the love of God pick up a new defense. See if the Pats are available. You might even be able to trade Driver for them. Just get a better Defense.|`|ec8903d549b112cfa54d415595b364f7aa	You have a good starter in Romo but drop Pennington, or trade him. Also trade Driver. Got a good line of RBs and WRs. Crumpler is a good pick at TE. Kaeding is a good kicker. But get a different defense. so here are your grades:<br>  <br>  QBs: B+<br>  RBs: A-<br>  WRs: A<br>  TE: A+(mostly because of Crumpler)<br>  K: A<br>  Def: F(seriously get a different defense)
YxlffUB5aa	I agree with not starting three players from the same team. I would go after Dallas Clark or Heath Miller. Either one of those guys are going to get you 5-7 TDs and 400-600 yards. Dallas might have the more upside because he plays in such a pass heavy offense.|`|H0knYRKbaa	last time i checked mcmichael played for miami.|`|YkuXyrZmaa	What you should really worry about is what you're going to on Dallas' bye week. Unless you have three good backups you can basically mark down a lose.<br>  <br>  Heath is a good choice for TE, which is basically a throw away position. Other than Gates I don't know many TE's that score big points. If you have a backup TE already you can drop Witten and pick up Heath. If you don't have a backup, why not just pick up Heath and keep Witten anyway. That way you can gauge them both based on performance and can play Heath when Dallas is playing a tough Defense. Then come bye week you also have less to worry about.|`|fTuEgEWiaa	I'd go after Heath Miller. He's a primary target for Big Ben in Pittsburgh and had a few quality games last year.<br>  <br>  I'd honestly just start Witten and not worry about it. If Witten is going to perform the best of all of your options, why would you change? You're looking for yards with tight ends and that won't be affected too much by TO and MB3.<br>  <br>  Just start the best players on your team. Don't worry what real team they play for.

Jackson<br>  T Glenn(if he gets well)<br>  Dwayne Bowe<br>  Amani Toomer|`|gVGvcIGiaa	I would start Lee Evans, Jackson and Battle. <br>  <br>  Toomer probably won't have a game like last week, especially if Eli is out. <br>  <br>  Jacksonville is expected to run the ball a lot more this week and Matt Jones hasn't proved to be a consistent fantasy player yet. <br>  <br>  Dwayne Bowe probably won't catch many balls because Herm Edwards said this week that they need to run the ball at least 30 times a game to win. Last week they only ran the ball 15 times.<br>  <br>  Jones only had two catches last week I expect the same this week.<br>  <br>  Glenn obviously isn't even an option.  <a href="http://www.dallascowboys.com/news.cfm?id=012B3E35-BF81-7005-760D3362ECDD44C6" rel="nofollow">http://www.dallascowboys.com/news.cfm?id...</a><br>  <br>  Battle had 5 catches for 60 yards. That is a solid third starter and San Fran should be playing from behind most of the game.

Bueno en mi opinión no solo es a Hugo Sanchez al que hay que cuestionar, es cierto que los partidos que ultimamente ha dirigido son una pésima presentación, pero a decir verdad en específico a los 2 últimos, los jugadores estaban en todos lados menos en la cancha, en el partido contra Haití, hubo muchas llegadas "buenisimas" para obtener gol, esto quiere decir que para este partido por lo menos si hubo una buena dirección, pero los jugadores fallaron muchos tiros, porqué atacar solo a Hugo, si el no estaba en el campo con los 11 en juego, yo creo que también es necesario llamar la atención y criticar con la misma fuerza a todos los demás que integran la selección. Te confiezo que pese a mi comentario si no a favor tampoco en contra, Hugo a mi me cae mal pero eso no quiere decir que le voy a hechar toda la culpa solo a él,|`|37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	NO|`|d7856b33124d1f896452f7ff1d709eabaa	Adios a Hugo, no sirve, no le interesa la seleccion|`|2XbjWU8aaa	Hugo hace todo mal,NO debe seguir en la selección Mexicana,HS,es un desastre.<br>  Suerte|`|JZk8tcTmaa	Mira Hugo es gente de futbol y el lo vivio como jugador y ahora como tecnico.<br>  <br>  Todo mundo sabe que de un equipo de jugadors, cuperpo tecnico entrenador directivos etc etc etc<br>  <br>  El puesto mas inestable es el de entrenador... tu ves que en un torneo salgan 6 directivos.... que corran a 6 jugadores...en cambio ya corrieron a 6 tecnicos<br>  <br>  <br>  Es el tecnico por la delicadeza del puesto o lo que sea pero es el tecnico el mas inestable y responsable del exito o fracaso<br>  <br>  y en este caso quedo demostrado que es su responsabilidad debido a su incopetencia, NINGUN ENTRENADOR EN LA HSITORIA HABIA TENIDO TODO EL APOYO NADIE<br>  <br>  Si con eso no los puedes meter a la segunda ronda de un preolimpico es un fracaso y su responsabilidad<br>  <br>  HUGO DEBE DE IRSE YA|`|dK42eY7Daa	El Sr. Hugo Sanchez pide que por cada partido que la seleccion nacional juegue fuera del DF se le regale un terreno? o si no se le daba el terreno que se le pusiera su nombre a alguna calle principal de esa ciudad?<br>  <br>  Sabian que hugo es uno de los principales accionistas del hotel en donde la seleccion pre-olimpica se concentro durante 1 mes en cancun? que dicho hotel no contaba con las instalaciones adecuadas para una correcta preparacion ya que solo tiene una pequena cancha de futbol con pasto sintetico.

La respuesta esta fácil un jugador estrella no le importa ganar o perder. Ninguna federacion nacional paga como los clubes. En México tiene la costumbre de poner a los mejores a prueba. Creo que los novatos deben de salir a ganar su pase al club mejor pagado. Así México tendrá un mejor equipo balanciado!

gp8M8pg1aa	I play goalie and the only advice i can give you is find a really good goalie trainer and try to get on a good club team. If you're patient and practice then you will get better. <br>  One of the reasons that i like goalie is because of the rush that you get when you extension dive and make a great save or you block a pk or you save your team's butt. Those are the moments that keep me loving it. You get the same feeling when you score the game winning goal. It gives you the feeling of importance.|`|kTn8BPMFaa	number one, dont be afraid of the ball. if you are scared of balls coming very very fast at you, than obviously, you are not a good goalie to start off with.<br>  second, dont be afraid to go after the ball, and get dirty every once in a while. slide tackle, dive, do anything to make sure the ball doesnt go past, into the goal. if it does, not the end of the world. you tried your hardest. just try harder each time.<br>  third, if a forward, with the ball, is coming toward you, one on one, come out farther to meet. dont stay back in the goal, or they will have a better chance of scoring. coming out just means closer to them, so they have less space to shoot, and more you.<br>  be smart, be brave, be daring.<br>  im goalie and ive gotten hurt SO MANY TIMES, i REALLY dont care anymore. sprained wrist, NO big deal. i just keep playing. i LOVE the competition. and im one of those go getters. - slide tackling or just plain tackling, diving, and that stuff.<br>  o, ya, one more thing, try to catch the ball, not just deflecting of your hands or your feet or body. yes, i have a problem with this too, but im working on it. keep your hands in a "w" shape, and be prepared when forwards are charging at you.<br>  and, please, make sure the ball doesnt roll in between your legs and into the goal. this has happened to me a few times. and....its pretty embarrassing and lame.<br>  good luck.|`|YqgqJfTxaa	Positioning, running out, corner positioning, shot stopping, flying saves and others endless tricks to become a true goal keeper. check out  Torrentz.com and ISOHUNT.com soccer tips for goalkeepers.  gl|`|klV9EpA0aa	oh i was a golie last year for my skool and not to brag but i rokedd!<br>  all u have to do really is keep ur eye on the ball and not get scared of it!|`|okaDmGPfaa	n o|`|H71NPd7Jaa	If possible link up with other local goal keepers and have training sessions with yourselves in mind.<br>  <br>  As a coach we regualry try to arrange training sessions for keepers only where we make their skills the focus of the sessions.

When they get close to you, charge 'em and take the ball out of their possession, preferably with your hands. Don't just stand there and wait for them to shoot on you. You don't really want to give them that chance. Of course, if they're too far out, you don't wanna go running from your position, leaving the goal fully exposed and unprotected.

su9qdUqLaa	There is a lot required to being a Karate teacher.  First a passion to teach is a great prerequisite as well as a passion for the art you are teaching, in this case Karate.<br>  <br>  You need to be good at communicating to your students exactly what they need to know/do in order to advance in the art you are dedicating your time to.<br>  <br>  You need to be able to see what they are doing wrong and explain how to do it correctly.  As well as be able to explain why they are doing things the way you say.  It's not good enough to show someone how to do it and expect them to follow you blindly.  People need to know why they are doing it so they know why they are coming to your school every week.  "Because I said so" is not a good answer.<br>  <br>  Being able to teach different people who have different ways of learning is a big challenge for being a Karate teacher.  Not everyone can take in the same piece of information and translate it the same way.  You will need several different ways to say the same thing to different people.<br>  <br>  What I'm getting at in short is that the actual teaching part is probably going to be harder then becoming a higher level karate teacher.  It's good to take notes from your instructor as you move up the ranks.  Observe them and see what works for them and what does not work.<br>  <br>  Take what you think will work for your and adapt their methods to fit your own.  Get yourself to a high rank, build up some form of credentials (tournament victories, street cred, or whatever you can think of), and let your instructors know what you want to do which is become a Karate teacher.  Maybe they'll take you aside and teach you some extra things and give you the attention you need to grow as an instructor.<br>  <br>  Here is a nice website I found that might help you out some.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Complete-Guide-to-Becoming-a-Karate-Instructor&id=881434" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Complete-G...</a><br>  <br>  It has some great information about becoming a karate instructor plus extra articles that will help you get to where you need to go. <br>  <br>  Just remember:<br>  Not all black belts should be teachers and not all teachers should be black belts.<br>  <br>  It will take more then just a high ranking belt to be a great or even a good karate teacher.  Communication and a passion for teaching is a MUST!|`|YDpT2ClBaa	years of studying karate, the title sensei is not given to you are at lest a sandan (3rd degree) in most organizations. <br>  you need skill and experience as well as knowledge.<br>  the ranks of shodan and nidan you are not a teacher but you should be learning how to teach at these ranks, <br>  <br>  when you feel you know all there is to know and have nothing more to learn well in that case you are an idiot. even a teach is still a student, you should be constantly learning. karate takes years even decades to learn an a life time to master.<br>  <br>  |`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I agree with Shihan J but you need to understand that role of a true Sensei means that you are no longer important but rather your dojo and students are priority number one. You will need to train for the rest of your life or end up becoming another statistic in the world of wanna be instructors. If you do not truly earn the title then it will show through your every action as true Sensei can tell who truly are the instructors. Each system is different but most instructors are here today and gone tomorrow because they forget the top three rules:<br>  <br>  1. Your students must be the most important thing in your life.<br>  2. You must be knowledgable and skillful in order to pass on what you have been honored with - not given.<br>  3. You must be void of ego, not care about what rank or title you hold and realize that true / authentic martial arts is about respect, honor and integrity above all else.<br>  <br>  If you can truly sacrifice your life to help others welcome to the fold but if not please save us all the time and embarrassment of becoming another so called master opening another so called dojo and getting money from people for what you believe you may know.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Lets start by saying that a lot of training is involved. If you want to become an instructor in the school I attend you need to be a minimum of a 2nd degree black belt and fulfill leadership criteria where you are observed teaching classes and private lessons. You need to know your curricula backwards and forwards. If you are shy- get over it you will need to be outgoing and a firm hand especially when teaching children. The rest is training and experience, a real love of the art and a devotion to your students. |`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	firstly you need to define teacher.<br>  <br>  in some schools brown belts teach junior classes as part of their development for becoming a black belt.<br>  <br>  then a black belt might teach on nights when the sensei cant come to class.<br>  <br>  then a black belt of a certain dan grading may start a branch and have sensei come to visit say monthly to oversee quality.<br>  <br>  then at a certain level a black belt may totally branch away and start a new school or style.<br>  <br>  oh so many types of "teacher".<br>  <br>  do you mean one of these or starting your own style?|`|YCZBmK0Gaa	Years of martial arts<br>  Experience<br>  Money to start a business<br>  Certifications|`|w9kSGLBxaa	years and years of taking karate|`|4TeXG3Yqaa	First of all you need to be able to execute all techniques that you want to teach at the highest level, and you should be able to articulate clearly to others how to peform the techniques you are showing them.  It is possible for someone with minimal skill to teach a few simple techniques, but typically a high, high level of proficiency in martial arts is essential to be a qualified instructor.  Many teachers may claim affiliation with some federation, organization, or association (such as USTF, or TKA), but this is not always necessary for them to teach.  With the recent surge of popularity of so-called "mixed" martial arts styles, the traditional belt structure and ranking system are falling by the wayside - so there is no hard/fast rule of what makes a school and its instructors legit.  Be warned though, that many "teachers" have little if any formal training, and often the newer mixed styles lack any traditional value system of discipline or honor, often encouraging you to seek out trouble or fight for fun.  I feel this is also partly to blame due to movies/media, and to the short attention span of most Americans and the desire to learn something fast and right now.  People don't want to study basic stances and drill techinques and/or hyung or kata fundamentals for five years as I did when I first started.  I was a second degree black belt (third degree recommended, which meant I was ready to test for 3rd but had not yet) with eight years experience  before I started to teach on my own.  In structured classes, I did start teaching white/yellow/green belts (under the black belts approval and watchful eye) when I was a brown or blue belt with 4 or 5 years exp.   Traditional systems have their own methods, belt structures, tenets and rules, so even a lower ranking belt or newbie could potentially teach some techniques to a point.  Your best bet, is to find a style you are interested in, and stick with it.  Educate yourself on that system or on martial arts in general by reading and doing research (but dont try to learn techniques from a book though) and you'll find yourself being a teacher without even realizing you've become one.  One thing to remember though - if the teacher only tells you to do some kind of drill or technique but never does it himself - watch out!  I always did everything with my students -including the pushups!|`|2rW4tRniaa	when i started learning back in 1975.more time was spent on producing<br>  quality students.but now days quantity of students has taken over.<br>  this has ruined the martial arts and they are very much mish mash.<br>  look to work from syllabus that is traditional.that way you will be able<br>  to tell your students.at least they can go look in book and see what<br>  they have learned is genuine.and bare in mind most schools have changed there syllabus to make it easier for them to retain there<br>  students.so as to increase there profit.as a result the standard has<br>  become abizmal.and in my time a blackbelt was special.now its nothing.the old gradings sorted the good from the bad.you had to<br>  be good.one mistake and people would fail.but now flash the cash<br>  and every one will pass.last of all to answer this question its simple<br>  dedication.<br>  |`|XkucIzmgaa	Years of practice and mastering, then being appointed instructor.|`|b9ffaff4abea87dd61cf0e385b28e457aa	Skilled enough to properly teach.|`|bd2a81a239da5fb2b541eaaed908b8bbaa	skill

Matt Cassel, New England: Shoes too big to fill and he’s just not used to playing.<br>  <br>  29. Kyle Orton, Chicago: Too conservative and physically limited.<br>  <br>  28.Gus Frerotte, Minnesota: Still has a big arm and all of the benefits from a great run game.<br>  <br>  27. Brian Griese, Tampa Bay: Serviceable and smart, but he can't carry the team.<br>  <br>  26. Jon Kitna, Detroit: Just too many turnovers and too much to overcome.<br>  <br>  25. Marc Bulger, St. Louis: He’s not the same guy from a couple years ago. He has fallen the furthest.<br>  <br>  24. Derek Anderson, Cleveland: Better pick it up with Brady Quinn waiting in the wings.<br>  <br>  23. Matt Schaub, Houston: He will get better because he’s too accurate to continue struggling.<br>  <br>  22. Matt Ryan, Atlanta: I list him here only because he’s a rookie. This kid can play.<br>  <br>  21. David Garrard, Jacksonville: He’s not protecting the ball like he did last year. He’s very poised and at least he’s not asked to throw much.<br>  <br>  20. Carson Palmer, Cincinnati: Used to be a top-three QB. His arm should be better, but he just doesn’t have any rhythm now.<br>  <br>  19. Matt Hasselbeck, Seattle: He has minimal help right now and he’s forced to do too much in the offense with no wide receivers.<br>  <br>  18. Kerry Collins, Tennessee: The Titans can actually pass now.<br>  <br>  17. J.T. O'Sullivan, San Francisco: He has earned the job; He understands Mike Martz’s system, which will get better. And he has unknown potential.<br>  <br>  16. JaMarcus Russell, Oakland: Huge arm on this kid. The Raiders are protecting him too much with their play-calling.<br>  <br>  15. Jason Campbell, Washington: Getting a good feel for West Coast offense and he’s unflappable.<br>  <br>  14. Chad Pennington, Miami: He’s consistent, smart and perfect for Miami. He lacks big-play ability though.<br>  <br>  13. Kurt Warner, Arizona: Obviously, he’s capable of big numbers. He has great timing and accuracy and he’s a proven playoff QB.<br>  <br>  12. Jake Delhomme, Carolina: He’s a great leader, but gets too emotional. He makes the Panthers go, but he needs protection.<br>  <br>  11. Brett Favre, N.Y. Jets: He gives the Jets a chance, but he takes too many chances. He has more guts than any QB.<br>  <br>  10. Trent Edwards, Buffalo: I love this kid -- great pocket presence, loves the stage and his team believes he will always come through with a win.<br>  <br>  9. Philip Rivers, San Diego: He’s capable of a top-5 ranking, but late losses have cost him. He will take his chances with the big plays.<br>  <br>  8. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh: Great pocket awareness and he can make all the throws. He wins even when he doesn't have a great stats game.<br>  <br>  7. Peyton Manning, Indianapolis: He would be No. 1, but the knee injury has slowed him. His explosiveness is missing and he’s just not the typical Peyton Manning.<br>  <br>  6. Eli Manning, N.Y. Giants: His swagger is growing and he limits his mistakes now, while still making plays in big games.<br>  <br>  5. Drew Brees, New Orleans: He’s an overachiever that plays big and will keep the Saints in every game.<br>  <br>  4. Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay: He could be the MVP at this point. There is no one under more scrutiny and he’s playing great.<br>  <br>  3. Jay Cutler, Denver: He has through-the-roof talent and he’ll have the Broncos in the playoffs. His arm takes a backseat to no one.<br>  <br>  2. Tony Romo, Dallas: Another playmaker with great weapons. His confidence allows him to take too many chances, but this guy loves to compete.<br>  <br>  1. Donovan McNabb, Philadelphia: Off-the-charts start!

6rxhges4aa	i don't actually practise tang soo do but it is closely related to tae kwon do in which i hold dan grade.<br>  <br>  don't let the other "experts" try to convert you-tang soo do can be a very effective system of fighting for those who excel in it-and you will only excel through hard work and determination-so why not give it a go?.<br>  <br>  chuck norris studied tang soo do so if you like the way he handles himself there it is in all its glory.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Tang Soo Do is great. I loved taking it and I mix what I learned into the training I do now. <br>  Keep in mind that although it is a Korean form of martial art is draws its roots from the Tang dynasty in China and the Japanese that occupied Korea at the time. <br>  Have fun with it. |`|hDE4xDOYaa	Tang so do means the art of the china hand.Its roots lie in the time of the Japanese occupation of Korea when local arts were banned. Consequently the poomse (Kata's) are all direct copies from japanese karate ( Shotokan i believe). A few high kicks have been thrown in to make it seem Korean. A study of Karate or Tae kwon Do would give you all the same skills. I hold black belts in both and am currently studying wing chun, a very effective chinese art.
vRbkui0Yaa	I think everything has a time and a place<br>  <br>  a lot of people claim TKD wouldn't do well in a UFC competition but a my trainer for MMA has a very strong kicking base, he took some Muay Thai, Savate and some TKD as well as several people who came in to train are black belts in TKD<br>  <br>  as a result i have put numerous TKD kicks into my  stand up<br>  kicking people when they dont expect it, from angles they dont expect<br>  <br>  granted it alone is no good, theres no ground work, no submission skills, and no emphasis on hand strikes which are important, if someone bum rushes you and gets you up against and wall you need to know how to punch and elbow, maybe throw a knee if you can, you wont be able to have the distance to kick<br>  <br>  <br>  but<br>  everything has a time and a place and TKD can prove to be very effective against other martial arts<br>  in general tho<br>  <br>  it has nothing to do with the art, but the artist<br>  <br>  if i were a wrestling and shot in to take you down and you kick me in the head as im charging in, im not exactly gunna be concious to do anything, if i charge in faster then you can kick, if i catch your kick and punch you like a boxer<br>  if you kick me before i can do any of that<br>  <br>  its the artist<br>  not the art|`|CJqSJKpraa	with the right distance and timing, the TKD 'tornado kick' can knocked out any martial artist!   even the martial arts tv programm 'Human Weapon' says: taekwondo is the most popular and deadliest fighting art in the world.    n watch 'fight science', therez this australia bloke called Bren Foster who is a world champion in taekwondo, he does crazy kicks in the air.|`|gJzoedxvaa	boxing sucks it works what upper body fists wow any 1 can throw a few punches these days u gota mix it up punches,throws,kicks,grabs thats the way to fight well it may sux compared to others lols but its alot better then nothing.  if u do want to change i suggest doing mixed martial arts u can kick the crap out of any 1 dosn't matter what they do mma its everything watch neva back down they do mma its ownage man<br>  <br>  <br>  dam i so envy u :( i wana learn 2 fight instead i do soccer dont get me wrong i love but i just wana fight to drop pplz|`|o6fol32Caa	No martial art sucks, you just have to know what you like and what your looking for.

If you like to wear jeans, a lot of the kick repetoire you learn will not be beneficial in a street situation. Also, there is more than just 1 on 1 matchups to consider in street situations. Often you're attacked by 3 or more thugs, who are not nearly as well trained as a dedicated martial artist. If it were all about 1 on 1 matchups, I'd go with a ground style, but go to ground against 2 people, and the other will hit you with a tire iron while you're wrestling the 1st. No martial art is perfect. Get good at one martial art, but expand your horizons by taking another style or two so you can deal with multiple situations. <br>  i.e. If your base style is Taekwondo, and you enjoy doing it, definitely stick to it, and I'd suggest taking up a little Judo, or another ground style to round yourself off. |`|B6dQzaGyaa	the person not the style would define the definition of it sucking.

The biggest problem with TKD is that there are 1009895898985858 people who teach it and about 30% of them actually run good schools and are advancing it, others are just cashing in some bucks and thinking they are Mr Miyagi|`|AA11264943	No, it doesn't suck.|`|zZjgLhRWaa	its not the style that is bad.<br>  only bad teacher and bad students<br>  a good fighter can use any style|`|v1mbL56caa	Well there is a thought.

Take Kwan Do is as good as any other art. It has all the tools you need to defend your self and than some. What sucks is too many Mcdojos that teach broken art. Most arts are adequate for self defense if taught correctly and the student is willing to learn. <br>  By the way was it not Tae Kwan Do you used to "kick  the crap out of him"? No need to answer.

You are asking about how to motivate individuals from a generation that has been centered on "ME" first. That said... Those that have trained for several years either learn to get past the "Me" stuff and look toward that good of the school or they drop out.<br>  In order to motivate this group you have to make it about them. My suggestion is that as a club you must have a governing head. Put an addendum into the clubs university charter that states that each individual must participate in a specific number of events in order to be considered an active member of the club. Then set up special training groups for "active" club members only and regular classes for "non-active" members. Make the "active" training material exciting.<br>  The only other suggestion is that the devoted core group needs to pump some energy into the rest of the group. Do demonstrations at campus events... get some excitement going.<br>  Good luck- you will have a difficult time at first but if you can motivate a few the rest may follow in a domino effect. If not then you have a few more with a genuine interest.|`|zZjgLhRWaa	what do you expect from collage students.<br>  unless you make it mandatory or require them to volunteer x amount of times it will be difficult at best|`|r5AMG8g7aa	 I fully understand the problem. Unfortunately, you can't make people do things. At 54 years old I have seen this over and over in many different types of groups. There are those that will do things and those that sit by and do nothing. To give you an example...... I'm a member of a group of martial arts grand masters. It is (or at least was) a very prestigious group. In the early 1990's the group functioned well. Since then most of the members sit around and ask what is going on. They do nothing. They wait until the 2 or 3 in charge get something going. Then they usually don't participate once something is planned.   <br>  <br>   Lets' face it. most people talk about getting together and doing something. Few get around to doing anything.  Best when you want something to happen is to do it yourself.

FMEHpZZFaa	I would go with the sword. It takes a lot of courage to look into the eyes of your opponent and take his life. Much more courage than shooting a gun from the farthest distance possible... where is the courage in that?<br>  |`|LnJjS8BRaa	Realistically, I'd have to go for whatever throws the most ammunition at the enemy, that and explosives.<br>  <br>  Ideally, I think wars should be fought with the "classic" weapons. Ending a life should not be a matter of getting a lucky shot from a couple hundred yards. War is not to be taken lightly and so I feel that bladed weapons and the tactics required to fight as such demand more respect. <br>  <br>  There is no way we could get the rest of the world to agree on warfare like this though, which is why we'll be using guns as long as they are the most effective.<br>  <br>  Now, what would be the best would be a world where learning to use these weapons is purely a matter of choice, and not a means of survival. But that's even more out there than a world where combatants have laid down guns and explosives and taken up a blade again.|`|75v5LmSIaa	depends, i'd go with the situation and what i have at hand.<br>  <br>  Of course i'd always want a knife with me, both for silent kills and for setting off traps / treating my own wounds.  (ok heating up a knife and sealing the wound isn't great but its an option, there's also using it to cut stitches etc)<br>  <br>  On a similar note i'd want a handgun for mid range combat or a rifle for long range.  I mean I suppose a bow and arrow would be useful in the trenches also due to being able to send a volly of arrows over the trench.  But on a similar note, a longbow in the middle of a battle isn't that great.<br>  <br>  |`|AA10270018	You ever heard of a saying "don't bring a knife to a gun fight"?|`|86J4SDA0aa	Use for what purpose?  For killing people?<br>  <br>  A smart person wouldn't want to use any weapon if he or she could avoid it.<br>  <br>  Assuming that a weapon is necessary to defend your life or the lives of others, you'd want to use the weapon that would allow you to destroy your immediate enemies as quickly as possible, avoid innocent casualties and cause others to be fearful of your strength thus reducing future conflict.<br>  <br>  For that purpose, modern weaponry would likely be more effective in almost every circumstance.<br>  <br>  For "cool factor", ancient weapons are certainly attractive, but in terms of actual combat, the purpose of combat is to kill your enemy - If you feel you need to engage in that activity, you should use the tool which gives you the greatest possible chance of achieving that goal.|`|HweEgwE4aa	READ A HISTORY BOOK.

Good Luck , be smart . |`|AA10270018	Why? bricks don't punch back...|`|FMEHpZZFaa	People do not start out breaking bricks. You have to condition your hands and especially the bones in your hands. As you begin the practice of breaking  you will; over time, cause micro fractures in the bones of the hand and wrist. As these fractures heal the calcium deposits make the bones stronger. Over the course of several years you can get to the point you seek. Go to some martial arts tournaments and watch the breaking competition. You will see concrete and bricks being broken by many of the advanced belts, but never by a child or a teen since they can permanently damage the bones, muscles and tendons in their hands due to lack of calcification.<br>  Beginners usually begin with wood or plastic re-breakable boards. From there you can progress to harder objects. The coolest thing to watch is when someone can break a coconut with a strike. That requires the generation of 1600 lb.s of pressure per square inch. That is a lot of power...<br>  Hope this helps. <br>  You might want to watch the video XMA that was made for the Discovery channel.

VERY tough.<br>  <br>  Line up the strike with the middle of the brick and when you hit, visualize hitting the ground below the brick. <br>  <br>  A palm strike would be a safer bet if you haven't conditioned your hand at all.<br>  <br>  Simple physics.|`|0eSKw62Yaa	well. people punch through bricks by first breaking the board and something that is more thicker than a board.

kEe56BJTaa	For control: Circle dribbling - Dribble in a circle while using one side of one foot, eg. outside right foot or inside left foot.<br>  <br>  Juggling: Put back spin on the ball when you kick it up and it won't go too far away. Also, use your thigh if it starts going out of control.<br>  <br>  One V One Defending: Watch the ball and not the eyes.<br>                                   Never go in for the challenge, that's the worst thing you can do.<br>                                   Never give up. The hardest thing when beating a player is when they won't stop hassling you, no matter how bad they are.<br>  <br>  Ball Handling: Roll the ball under your foot for better control, and only use the outside of your bad foot as it is much easier to use than the inside.|`|2QXSCHUkaa	A stronger kick comes with more muscle and technique, work on some technique first then train muscle, Controlling the ball in the air i would suggest either throwing the ball up against a wall then chesting,heading,or whatever. Better touches on the ball can be achieved through consecutively kicking the ball against a wall and trying to hit it in one touch and come right back to you, although u may move a little, left foot juggling can be achieved first by training ur left foot by only passing against a wall with ur left. One-on-one defender can be done by simply have two people(obviously) and telling them to rush you, the trick is to be patient, follow there moves but only challenge when u have an excellent chance to take the ball. Passing/vision can only be achieved through experience and gameplay. you will learn the trouble areas and find ways to avoid them(such as kicking the ball off the openent to get a throw in for ur team if in bad field position)|`|a7f0a207efd4bfde7a89a1744872689baa	work on your touch first and foremost. the best way to get used to controlling a ball is simply to learn to juggle|`|6y9Bqok9aa	now i dont expect this to get best answer but heres a tip, in a defensive shuffle try and lean him towards the sidline, and if he stars getting fancy on you watch the ball and try to fake diving in by stomping your foot|`|FMEHpZZFaa	To work on controling the ball you should first work with a wall. I just love this drill. Stand about 2 feet from a wall; not the side of someones house or an indoor wall, think brick or cinder block. Start with a soft touch and control the rebound of the ball. Do not move further away but gradually add power to your pass. The ball will come back at you faster and you will really have to work to control and return the ball to keep the flow going. The point is to get control and return to ball quickly in as seamless a manner as possible. This exercise will make you focus and work on passing and judgement skills.<br>  For the long ball you just need to find time to get to a pitch at a local school and practice goal kicks. Work them until you feel comfortable putting the ball at least mid field. Then work on putting the ball where you want it.<br>  To get better at one on one you need to play against people that are better than you and pick up pointers. Find a local park and see if you can get into some pickup games. Practice is the only way you will get better. Besides the more you play the more you get used to how different people handle the ball and you will be better prepared for surprises in a game. <br>  Watch football games and take notes!<br>  Juggling takes practice. I used to coach pee wee teams and get them juggling and kicking properly by placing the ball into a pair of mums old hose. You tie off the waist end and grab the legs. You can practice power kicks and by holding onto the leggings the ball does not travel very far away. Shorten your grip on the leggings and juggling can be practiced in a close space. Just remember when juggling that it is all in the touch and the timing. Too much power and the ball gets away from you, too little and the ball flops onto the ground.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|hgkFByStaa	<br>  to controll the ball in the air and bring it down to your feet the key is to bring your knee over the ball-if you want to play it in the just keep your knee back a little. But never lean back, you loose momentum and balance. <br>  <br>  for better touches on the ball foot work wise is to stay light footed never flat footed using all sides of your feet. never lean back! <br>  <br>  juggling skills just try 1 bounce then catch it. than 2 than 3 and so on. it works.<br>  <br>  1v1 defence. the key is to run up to your oppenet but give him a few feet. than stand in a surfboard position inticipating their every move push him to the side lines force him to make it into the center and snatch the ball. <br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect!!<br>  <br>  Oh and keep your head up while moving with the ball. 
Yslq4OYhaa	You are never too old to learn! There is no age limit as to being to old too learn martial arts. It would be a great time for you to learn. I started at 14. I know some that started at 50.<br>  Make sure you do some research before starting classes. Find the best instructor that you or your parents an afford. Try not to sign any long term contracts. Be weary of any false promises. Like you will be a black belt in one or two years. Yes, you may wear that rank, but you may not have earned it. It's is unfortunate that I have seen 6 year old black belts. A few competed against my son who was a yellow belt at the time. Those black belts were hurt losing to a yellow belt in kata and sparring. They didn't believe a yellow belt should beat them not knowing or realizing that they didn't have the knowledge or skills or maturity to be a black belt.<br>  <br>  Flexibility will come over time through training. You will also get in better shape as you train. Remember training isn't limited to your school. But sparring should be limited to your school and tournaments.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	My experience isn't with TKD, but no, you aren't by any means too old to start. Ideally I think around 14 might be the "best" age to start. I don't see much value in starting young children because I don't think they either have the mental maturity nor physical capability to understand and execute what they're being taught. The early teenage years are a great time to start because you can appreciate why you're there, you can understand what is being taught to you, and because your body is growing into maturity. I think you'll find studying any martial art will greatly benefit you mentally and physically, and that 16 is a great age to start. Good luck, and have fun with it!|`|mGzwEvQbaa	No.<br>  <br>  16 is practically perfect to start TKD.<br>  <br>  Like others have said, you are old enough to take it seriously and get more out of it.<br>  <br>  Your body is at the age where you can really maximize development.

bb75c006e5dfff116ffb27872ce76d0aaa	Taekwondo has a long history and can be traced back as early as AD 3 as being a self-defence martial art using only the hands and feet to fight off one's assailants. It differs from other martial arts in that a great deal of emphasis is placed upon using the legs to defend oneself. There are multiple interpretations of the name taekwondo. Taekwondo is often translated as 'the way of hand and foot'. The definition of the name Taekwondo is:<br>  <br>  Tae = 'to strike or block with the foot' or 'to kick', it also means 'jump'<br>  K'won = 'Fist', 'to strike or block with hand'<br>  Do = 'The way of' or 'art'.<br>  <br>  Put this together and Taekwondo means: "The art of Kicking and Punching" or "The art of unarmed combat". The sport has been founded in Korea and is one of the popular modern martial arts. |`|AA11264943	Those that say it's crap and useless don't know what they are talking about.  <br>  <br>  TKD gets a bad rap, but it really is a good martial art.  <br>  <br>  Like all martial arts, TKD has it's weaknesses, but fights are won or lost based on the individual fighter, not the style that they trained in.<br>  <br>  James|`|nRBC4E5saa	I have a good friend who's a third-degree black belt who I go to for training in footwork and kicking.

I know that I take some enjoyment out of watching the WTF-style sparring, and that some tough guys have backgrounds in TKD, and I know that many people enjoy it.  But I also know that it would be pretty far down on my list if someone asked me to recommend them a martial art for fighting or self-defense.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Tae Kwon Do invovles a lot of kicking and relies a lot on timing and speed. <br>  Don't discount it as all martial systems have their good sides as well as their bad sides.

They just use guns and handcuffs! lol!|`|YDpT2ClBaa	i had several instructors that were police officers. and as judomofo said they do learn techniques in the academy. it vary's from city to city as to what they are taught. some cities have a regular martial arts program. but not all.<br>  <br>  the uk i have no idea what they do there.|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Well I can't speak for UK Police.<br>  <br>  American Police are taught a lot of restraint and defensive tactics techniques, while in the Academy. A lot of them also supplement this with their own training in Martial Arts.<br>  <br>  But because of the way America is, they are forced to only rely on certain "approved" techniques in order to reduce the possibility of litagation or having someone get off on a technicality.<br>  <br>  Like anything else if an officer doesn't constantly work on DT (defensive tactics) it really isn't of use to him because he is ineffective at it. Most of them improvise some sort of restraint techniques on their own, having back up, weapons and such also is helpful.<br>  <br>  Again, no idea about UK Police.<br>  <br>  But here you rarely find an off duty cop without his gun, or some sort of weapon. They are even allowed to carry it in many places conceal and carry people are not.<br>  <br>  I think if any cop is on his beat it doesn't matter who he comes up against, he still is going to have back up and a few weapons (Pepper spray, tazers, beat sticks, tactical knives,  guns.. yes, primary and a back up).<br>  <br>  But hand to hand wise, most cops are A type personalities, they generally do end up doing some sort of hand to hand training, the ones that do not are just as succeptable to an asskicking as anyone else. The difference is 90% of the time they will have the law on their side. <br>  <br>  Again, I can't speak for UK Police, only Americans.|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Here in the UK its a a bit of a joke to be honest. Most of the police officers are taught very little but then again most of them seem to be about 12 years old!<br>  <br>  I have trained with a few over the years. Its not their fault but the system and tick boxes they have to play with!<br>  <br>  We like to do policing on the cheap or for free in the UK but as long as the stats say everything is ok then the public seem to buy it?<br>  <br>  Best wishes<br>  <br>  idai|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	Some train in krav maga <br>  <br>  check kravmaga.com|`|0FQhjFXlaa	I would imagine any law enforcement officer would have to know and train in hand to hand and restraint or compliance techniques such as come-alongs, wrist pressure locks, arm locks and takedowns.  Officers, esp here in the US, are not allowed to bash a suspect's brains in.  They need to exert control to apprehend the suspect.   I work next to a police academy and have observed many of their hand to hand classes in the gym.|`|FMEHpZZFaa	Depends on the individual. <br>  I know that there are several police officers that train with my instructor and I know several officers from England that also train that I have met at international tournaments. <br>  Keep in mind that not everyone trains, but anything can happen on any given day even to an experienced and well trained martial artist.|`|75vXqX1taa	In the UK they are taught VERY minimal control and restraint techniques. However, the majority of them seek additional training in their own spare time to supplement. Understandable considering they do a dangerous job for which they receive laughable training. i was genuinely shocked when the first police officer joined our dojo and we realised he couldnt control a puppy on a leash! - no fault of his own remember!|`|S5K0OqwTaa	depends on the person and what they do on the free time but the us police train in some hand to hand combat in the academy but they don't practice once they get out of the academy. I can not speak for the UK police |`|8msToqKnaa	Many American police officers do train in some form of martial arts.  In fact one common way for up and coming fighters to make money is to teach at police academies.  The Ref Big John McCarthy was/is a Police instructor. |`|Wnfp395iaa	Yes they do, usually more of wrestling martial arts that focus on locks , but they just learn the basics and a few advanced locks and takedowns.|`|DPBgVA6Caa	My father was a police officer in the UK and I know he with other officers was sent on an Aikido course.|`|AA12388139	It is a fact of life that in general, the governing organisations of law enforcement officers do not provide the Regular close quarter combat and restraint training that their officers need.  Regular training is needed for officers to reasonably cope with the violent situations that are characteristic of their day-to-day duties.<br>  <br>  Police officers are correct in drawing their weapon and backing off from trouble, getting help.  At close quarters they are in great danger of being knifed or otherwise overwhelmed.<br>  No matter how well trained; there is no guarantee of success and safety in close confrontations.<br>  <br>  The law enforcement officers that I have seen with were all far too busy to easily spare the regular training time that they needed to be competent in hand-to-hand situations.  Therefore you have to cull and design a training program that meets their specific needs and, unfortunately, leave alone a lot of the basics that martial arts would consider to be essential.  Officers are also loaded down with gear and must cover their exposed weapon.  FBI agents don't have the problem of heavy gear around the hips and their weaponry is discrete.  This allows more flexibility for them in the choice of techniques.  But still, some FBI agents are often heavily overworked, at call, and would have to be taken off duty to do the refresher causes that they need.<br>  <br>  Because of the circumstances of officers with gear, legal and time constraints, the usual martial arts are of little use to them.  Law departments that do want competent officers, do not rely on the officers getting their own outside training.  They elect to have a specialised composite art taught in house and/ or specialists brought in for classes.  There are available a large number of made-up arts with made-up names that are taught to officers.<br>  <br>  The value of a truncheon, or the like, is the extra safety and attack distance that it provides.  It is a useful tool against a knife (but not a guarantee of success), and keeping a great distance away from a knife wielding opponent is much safer.  Unfortunately the police are actually expected to protect the public and restrain violent persons; and later in the courts having to fight to prove that they themselves are not criminals (unless they were injured or dead when they would then not be expected to humiliatingly justify themselves).<br>  <br>  A martial artist of any standing, though holding no implement of violence, would be considered to be 'armed' with their combat ability.  If an armed officer, confronts such a combat or martial art trained person, the officer should stay at a distance, draw a weapon and demand compliance.  If the officer is unarmed then they would be at extreme disadvantage and danger, unless the officer was also highly trained.  But how to judge who was the superior without the test of combat?  When an unarmed officer knows that a suspect is skilled in combat, that officer should stand off and get backup.<br>  
KzYJZGPAaa	Heck no, Batista has hold that title 3 or 4 times<br>  <br>  I don't really like Chis Jericho, but he deserves the title.|`|smcDn76jaa	I am not surprised, I saw it coming. I am so pissed about though.|`|b5c261dfe3ee5e5442b8195afe51a0b9aa	No not at all like triple h vs jeff hardy why do they let him play so mush if they know he lost allot of times,and it was different that r truth lost.but the rest was good.|`|GXXodH5Saa	It IS kind of obvious because most of the times WWE goes with what the fans want. But I personally liked how Batista won because then HBK, Orton, Cena and other Raw superstars can compete for it. Jericho has been such a idiot while he was champion and I think he will be asking for a rematch with Batista.|`|AA10065077	I have no feelings other than surprised. I don't know why they didn't let Chris Jericho have a little longer run with it. I was expecting a batista vs jericho feud with jericho still having the title. I'm waiting to see how this pans out.
aTkPvZQuaa	and the english are right..........................|`|RSJbqioUaa	I don't understand? Is english your first language? Please improve and come back.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	English football is the richest<br>  Spanish football is the best football<br>  Italians are the masters of cheats|`|PrsbAjZAaa	As far as i understand....Italy didn't do to well at the Euro's now did they?<br>  <br>  i'd rather England didn't make it there at all then to play how they did...|`|tdxurIr9aa	Good point.|`|uuMKRWF3aa	MAn Utd are the champions of EUROPE...<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  .... just reminding you of the facts|`|wR1MCUGaaa	1. English football is rich because investors feel its better to buy clubs there. Cause, it is the most watched league worldwide and its generates lots of revnue from Televsion deals. Which is good for the Investors when it comes to the dividend pay out. Plus, English league is slowly dominating Club football in Europe. I mean since 2005 there as been at least on english team in the Champions League final. This very promising for the rich investors who would rather buy into something that is rising.<br>  <br>  2. Spanish football used to be beautifull, the problem is that all the quality players and Coaches are leaving Spain because the heavy politics in the League. I mean how do you use a World Class player like RObinho as bait for another player? Spanish League is just gonna lose all its Talent. Its already lost Three top class stars in Ronaldinho, Robinho and Deco. The reason why it was beautifull was because spanish clubs had the money to attract the top stars from around the world but that is changing thanks to the revolution happening in England.<br>  <br>  3. Italian football teams win because they Match Fix. Jokes Hahaha. I really dont know where you got that from cause in the last 5 years they have only one the Champions League once. England has the most in the Last 5 years with 2. Italy died out Hard in 2001/02 season.  |`|63qvTmNoaa	I think you are right...<br>  <br>  Italy is World Champions and Milan is World Champions...<br>  <br>  The ultimate Golden Ball were Kakà (Milan) , Cannavaro (Italy), Ronaldinho (Milan), Shevchenko (Milan), Nedved (Juventus), Ronaldo (Milan)...<br>  <br>  The English best player, Beckham, now plays in Ac Milan; the last English Golden Ball was Owen that in Jenuary will go in Genoa (Italian Serie A); the actually Premier League Best Player is C.Ronaldo,but it is normal that into two years he will go in A.C. Milan or in Inter Milan (not in Real).<br>  <br>  The best player of the story was Maradona (Napoli) and the two best goalkeepers of the story were Zoff (Lazio & Juventus) and Buffon (Parma & Juventus).<br>  |`|vh2tuGZPaa	I have ni idea , I know what you are trying to say , but everyone thinks that their brand of football is the best , but Italy's style is getting old - and they will win less over the years |`|AA10206119	italians dont win ;o

You know, the "mind games" he plays on his opponents, never fails to entertain. |`|H3nbC71eaa	Sting comes to mind when you ask this. The fans were always into when he was chasing the belt back in the late 80's and early 90's..but his title reigns never were of great length. Him going after Ric Flair's belt always attracted a whole lot of attention. Even in the mid 90's with the NWO...he was almost the same thing. He had a year long build up just about before he went up against Hogan at Starrcade in 1997 to win the belt...but his reign wasn't long.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	Randy Orton, Jeff hardy, Y2J, MVP, Kane.<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy is the better chaser out of the above.

EgLdNAusaa	I guess it's only obvious to people who are biased about their own favorite team.  If your not a Utah Jazz fan, they only look like the average team that they actually are.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	You're right that nobody should be surprised at the success of a healthy Utah Jazz team.   They have the talent to compete with anyone and Williams and Boozer are the best PG-PF duo in the league.  However, the Jazz have had a difficult time playing the Spurs and Lakers in the playoffs.  In 2007, they were not one game away from the NBA Finals.  They lost to San Antonio 4-1.  The Spurs completely owned them.  But, I agree the Jazz are a team to be reckoned with.  I would love to see them beat the Lakers in the playoffs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_Playoffs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_Pl...</a>|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Agreed<br>  honestly many people thought they would do great this year but i think because of their slow start and injuries that many fans mightve forgotten how good a team they can be in the regular season<br>  dont worry,everyone is alreadyin fear of the jazz in the playoffs|`|n0v7LP39aa	You really do seem to know a lot about the Jazz but then so do I because I'm a big NBA fan. My team is the Warriors but I follow other teams to for fun. The Jazz are a very good team, maybe the third best in the Western Conference but they aren't going to overtake the Lakers this year. I doubt they can even take down the Spurs. They aren't a very good defensive team and lack a mindset to win on the road. They are good but not great.|`|ZBQN8viuaa	Last year....in 07 your missing the point that was before. THey could make it to the semi's this year, but they wont make it to the finals. THings can change over time, take the Lakers in 04, they lost to the Pistons in the finals, and didn't even make the playoffs the next year.  Now, there better than they were last year and there the best team in the league, i'll also remind u that the Lakers ended the Celtics 19 game winning streak and is to this point the only team to cleveland at home, there also the only team with two victories off the cavs and the celtics.................ffff who cares about last year

PniPsDmGaa	Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels<br>  <br>  <br>  These 2 have the biggest egos in the WWE. They have the most respect from the fans, and have been in some of the most exciting matches in the WWE. HBK is Mr WrestleMania, and Undertaker is the man with the WrestleMania Streak. When these 2 face off, it will be a match, where we will surely find out who the bigger WrestleMania Legend is.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	without a doubt undertaker v shawn micheals, after that match the crowd might be dead from cheering so loudly for that match, like how the rock v hogan was, icredible crowd but dead after that because they exhausted themselves too much.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Undertaker v.

ZbNXVQu7aa	Based on the superstars who have currently qualified, it would be almost too easy for me to say Money in the Bank.  I think I see what WWE is trying to do with the current MITB participants: get the crowd 100% behind Kane, despite trying so hard to appeal to the younger fans.  Still, MITB is not the correct answer to this question because it always has at least one OMG moment that should not be missed by anyone who spends their money on WrestleMania 25.<br>  <br>  Looking at the list of matches on WWE.com, the only one that even comes close to deserving the dubious distinction of becoming a "bathroom break" match is Triple H vs. Randy Orton.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  I already explained why Money in the Bank is worth watching.<br>  Edge and Big Show have given so much of their bodies for wrestling fans worldwide without reaching the level of corruption that Triple H has (although "on screen" Edge actually appears to be even more corrupt than "off screen" Triple H is), and regardless of who wins, both will put on a WrestleMania-worthy show.  Furthermore, as long as John Cena isn't added to the match and beats both of them, the winner will move one step closer to getting the respect he deserves from the higher-ups in the company.<br>  Do I really need to defend the HBK-Undertaker match?  Really?  Do I?<br>  <br>  I'm not counting Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy as a confirmed match, but I am expecting that to become a part of WrestleMania 25.  Even if I did count it as a confirmed match, their match would be (to borrow a phrase from Jim Ross) a good old-fashioned slobberknocker with sprinkles of poetic movements.  If/when it is added, I expect it to be better than nearly anything else on the card.  Any guesses on the one match I expect to be better than Hardy vs. Hardy?|`|41WXZPnCaa	An Interpromotional Match <br>  <br>  Maybe Like In WM 24 Batista vs Umaga <br>  <br>  I Think Will Be The 25 DIvas Battle Royal Match (Unconfirmed But Will Go on )|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Divas match.|`|bBHlGs5waa	The Cena/Edge/Big Show match.|`|9UHQSwDLaa	Not the divas match, because there are rumors that either Trish Stratus or Sunny will return!

4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Probably the entire match like the ohh ahh scream that people do when the top faces go against each other by punching each other taking turns. This will be the greatest match at wrestlemania and would be a match to remember.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ2: Undertaker would most likely get a bigger cheer because it's his hometown and with his undefeated wrestlemania streak he is most likely going to have the advantage in being a favorite to win the match.<br>  <br>  <br>  To me the outcome is important but i think the match itself will be the best.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	When The Undertaker beats Shawn Michaels and becomes 17-0.....we'll see how loud it gets then! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THE DEADMAN NO DOUBT WILL GET BIGGER AND BETTER CHEERS FROM THE FANS!

H3nbC71eaa	Agree.<br>  <br>  Now we all know the Attitude Era didn't have the best clean matches in history...it was a pure entertainment era.<br>  <br>  What some people forget is that right before the Attitude Era, the WWF was really struggling. Yeah it had that Iron Man Match with Bret and HBK prior to it, and a classic ladder match between Razor and HBK. But the company was still struggling to get TV ratings. When WCW started doing Nitro it was killing RAW in the ratings. It was so bad that there were rumors that the WWF was going to go bankrupt and fold. Then Stonecold came in, DX was born not too long after that...and business picked up like JR would say. The Attitude Era was a move that helped save the WWF from closing..literally. It was extremely successful during that era...even more successful than it is today.<br>  So would the WWE be as successful without the Attitude Era happening, no it wouldn't...and there was a great chance that if there was no Attitude Era the WWE would not even be around today.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes the WWF was extremely successful in the 80's during the Hogan's time, but when the mid 90's hit the company was starting to fall on hard times. That was right before the Attitude Era.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	The "Attitude Era" helped the WWF what it is today. There were so many talented wrestlers--Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Mick Foley, The Undertaker, Sable--it helped turn what was an awful product from the years 1993-1996 with the whole "New Generation" into a wrestling tour de force. Yeah, it was pushing the envelope with its gratuitous swear words, naked women, beer drinking and hard core matches and "I don't give a f____ attitude" but that is the whole reason why we tuned in and watched. We liked Vince taking pro wrestling to a whole new level.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Stone Cold Steve Austin was the reason for the birth and death of that era.  In 1996 he won the King of the Ring proclaiming Austin 3:16.....in 2002 he left because he didn't want to job to certain wrestlers.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Agree <br>  <br>  But Really We Have To Amit The WWE Will Not Be Sucecessful Without Paul Heyman Yeah <br>  <br>  The Attitude Era I Was A Copy Of The ECW Original And Then  When Paul Wa Hire By The WWF In 2002 Make Some Good Things Like Push Brock , And Another Thing|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Disagree,<br>  you know what was so great about Attitude Era? cause of Stone Cold Steve Austin and they also capitalize mistakes of WCW.<br>  <br>  Attitude Era was surely one of the best times but not the biggest and best. Wrestlemania 3 have 90000+ fans in attendance, Attitude Era never have more then 25000.<br>  Hardcore title was a joke cause of 24/7 rule.|`|fKfd4Tp1aa	Without the ''Attitude Era'', WWE wouldn't even exist today, since without it, WWE would have lost the ratings war against WCW. WWE was losing badly against WCW in the ratings war til the ''Attitude Era'' was fully ushered in.|`|9UHQSwDLaa	I totally agree with you. The Attitude Era was the building blocks of WWE. If there was no Attitude Era, then WWE would probally be the same back in the 80s.<br>  Attitude Era RULEZ!|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Disagree.<br>  <br>  WWE was big before the Attitude Era. It wouldn't be the same without it, no doubt, but still, WWE would still be just as strong as it is today.|`|bBHlGs5waa	STRONGLY AGREE.|`|X9iZA9svaa	agree|`|QbY18bjkaa	yes your right A'era brought it to new heights <br>  <br>  wm17 stone cold turning heel or kane vs undertaker|`|89a96a6cee365f054319086a8689cd08aa	Yes........|`|lz7oTQNXaa	i completely agree, i believe if the attitude era never came along we would still have these cartoon type characters back in the 80's.<br>  <br>  i also believe it showed that smaller guys who were not heavily muscled could draw in the buisness e.g the rock, austin, hbk and so on.<br>  <br>  i think to that characters are trying to be serious than too gimmicky, yeah u may get the odd gimmick character but not as many as there used to be.<br>  <br>  now its oh he will be the next rock or the next austin because that is the standard that was once successful for the wwe.|`|1sDPQxPaaa	I agree, there's too many variables proving this:<br>  <br>  -WCW and ECW was around<br>  -Too many great storylines and characters around<br>  <br>  ...I could go on forever, but the biggest reason would be,<br>  -The internet, because now it has grown to the point that shockers and surprises back would have been leaked during this age.|`|ifRitthKaa	The Attitude Era was what made many fans watch WWE but you can't discredit the wrestling boom of the 1980's, during which time, Hogan, Andre and all of the other legends revolutionised wrestling.|`|JhN3o7qXaa	100% absolutely agree. Stone Cold, the Rock, Jericho and HHH were the cornerstones that made it so popular|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Without the attitude era the WWE would have gone out of business thanks to WCW so it has to be an agree from me. I don't like what attitude did to the company and wrestling in general, it was an awful insult to wrestling but it kept the company alive.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I swear it was succesful way before the attitude era back when wrestler's like Bret Hart and Hogan were around

KJWxqQHiaa	Well, you can tell by my damn name that i like to go fishing! Yea, i live, breath, eat, sleep whatever the hell i do has FISHING involved.<br>  <br>  Just came back from a trip from the ole' creek. I tried to catch some carp & catfish, but ended up with no sucess and ended up fishing for panfish. I had planned to catch a lot, so i could get a big fish fry, you know? I got one hit on a lure. ONE. I was fishing a white w/red dot beetle spin when i got the hit, and i missed it. I had to fish with live-bait cause i wanted some freakin' fish & chips, but ended up catching 2 good fish. (That first one was pretty damn big, it was the same one that took the beetle spin.)<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, my biggest fish. i have never weighed them but, I've caught some BIG carp.|`|RxTIzsyhaa	Guess I'm bein' my OLD "smart-alicky" self by sayin' this butttt, "Does a' Bear s_ _ t in the woods";) ;)... Been fishin' for over 50 years so guess one could say I like it;)... <br>  < ' ( (( > <<br>  <br>  Biggest catch was when I lived in AK., and it wasn't all that big ~ 65' Halibut.

gnRiLwSxaa	1.   Hit to your opponents weaker side, usually the backhand<br>  2.   Hit drop shots and lobs to make them run and tire them out<br>  3.   Serve a slice serve wide, and come to the net<br>  4.   Lob over the netman's head when returning serve in doubles.<br>  5.   Serve into the opponents body now and then<br>  6.   On a weak second serve or a short ball, slice the return into the<br>        backhand corner and come to the net<br>  <br>  When used:   Whenever the opportunity comes along.|`|cBjQozuQaa	These tactics are usually used when playing a very solid player who use lots of topspin. <br>  1. Hit the first ball with topspin<br>  2. Hit the second returning ball with a slice<br>  3. If the ball is returned again hit a flat ball their way<br>  4. If this doesn't seem to be working find something that makes ur opponent vulnerable like lobs or hitting to their weak sides
pSOmwwlIaa	I'd take out "Chema" Cardenas and Corona from your list.<br>  Why?<br>  Corona is like 27 or 28. So he isn't really "young" like the other guys and G. Ochoa is gonna start after Oswaldo.<br>  Cardenas in my opinion is a average player. He's not good but not bad either. Why? 80% of his passes are whack. Just look at all his passes! A las Nubes! He wastes too many plays. He can't make 1 good pass. Now something positive, he's got speed and a very strong kick.<br>  <br>  Mexico's Future Players:<br>  Hugo Ayala(Atlas)-(Next Rafa Marquez)<br>  Juan Carlos "Torito" Silva(America)<br>  Marco Fabian(Chivas)<br>  Omar "Pina" Arellano(Chivas)<br>  Xabier Baez(Chivas)<br>  Edgar Pacheco(Atlas)<br>  Jorge Torres Nilo(Atlas)<br>  Darvin Chavez(Atlas)<br>  Luis "Maque" Robles(Atlas)<br>  Nestor Calderon(Toluca)<br>  Fernando "Zurdo" Morales(Pumas)<br>  Luis Venegas(Atlante)|`|X4aweBgTaa	yeah i would take out corona and el chema...and i would add gio dos santos..vela and guardado..whether you like it or not..gio and vela are still our future..ppl say gio should come back to get more playin time..why? we know he would come and score like crazy..that doesnt make him better..the competition isnot the same. also throw in hector moreno..he IS the next rafa.|`|YSvICGAfaa	ADD:<br>  Gio<br>  Vela<br>  "Cata"<br>  H.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	The "30-day" rule was something they used in the NWA/WCW and the territories, meaning it's an "old school" rule.  The WWE seems to be doing everything it can to distance itself from old-school pro wrestling, including changing rules to suit their whims.<br>  <br>  I couldn't even begin to tell you when was the last time I heard anybody in the WWE even mention that rule.|`|AA10065077	I really don't think that was real clause in a contract. I know that the champion has to be eligable to defend the title every 30 days. Remembers , when it comes to championships,that there are gimmicks used like John Cena said he would defend his title 24/7. As far as defending the championships it seems like every pay per view event has championship matches. It seems like there is at least one pay per view event per month. I agree with your statement about the heels. It's just more interesting to watch a heel continuously defend the championship to build the suspense to a pay per view.|`|582JeE3iaa	not true. The rule is that the champion must be eligle to defend the title every thirty days. Like if u have an injury fo r28 days, u can keep the belt, if like 3 months, u must reliquish it|`|bRGdkOwqaa	that was the rule and it was changed to pay per view rule like you can get hurt monday night after the pay per view but you must be able to participate in the next pay per view|`|V1O7N02saa	I suppose its still there, but not mentioned or enforced as much as it was.
NUehpH4yaa	wwe goes by the motto "if it's not broke, don't fix it"<br>  <br>  aslong as ratings are good that is|`|rjWlOAnEaa	Yeah.<br>  Take Snitsky for example. He has talent, all he needs is a push for him to get to show that talent off. |`|hvKQpxI0aa	There is no "Un"used talent. For instance William Regal one of the best wrestlers. He wasnt doing so good especially when I saw that Gauntlet match and now he's Intercontinental Champion. I predicted this in one of my questions. William Regal is going to be in a historical Intercontinental Championship match at WrestleMania 25. The Miz & John Morrison they aren't underused they are just getting warmed up. IN FACT I think that their isn't any unused talent! MVP will get back up. I mean c'mon he was a Double Champion and was in historical matches with Benoit. He cant always be on a role. With Jeff Hardy beating 'Taker and the crowd BOOING 'Taker which is just plain disgraceful and I hope everyone in that crowd dies soon. SO you tell me there isnt any unused talent. Oh, and Snitsky is TOO old for a big push. {37}|`|fCs8nxCwaa	hell yeah. that's on of the main reasons why i stostopedatching the WWE. they are coconstantlyver using guys like cena, HHH, batista, HBK, and much much more. what they need to do is bring back the cruiserweight championship and make jimmy wang yang a major title holder|`|AA10065077	I think that they should be pushing talent, but right now the WWE is in a lot of debt. So, to keep ratings they will probobly not push for a while.|`|V7LKViqwaa	Thats what they do these things take time|`|KyAFHTBuaa	Like Matthew said, it takes time. And be on the lookout for an up and coming star. A wrestler from my town was recently signed to the WWE. I believe he has had at least one "dark match" on ECW. his name is Brian Cage. no sure though if he will be using that name or not.
H3nbC71eaa	John Cena has always had respect for the old school..from the old school sports jerseys he used to wear with his rapper gimmick, to all the older wrestlers he respects..so this isn't a big deal. I'm sure Cena has a whole lot of respect for the AWA, and that shirt was made with his respect for the old school in mind.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Mixed feelings on this one.<br>  <br>  On one hand, that distinctive logo is out in public again, and because it's on a John Cena shirt, will be seen by a lot of people.<br>  <br>  But on the other hand, "AWA" is nowhere on that shirt.  Most fans will think that logo was designed for John Cena and will either love it or hate it for that reason without knowing where the logo came from, or for what it meant.<br>  <br>  I would rather the WWE have made a shirt with the original AWA logo intact; it would probably sell ok.  Certainly not like a Cena shirt or an Undertaker shirt would sell, but at least everybody would know what the logo signifies.|`|AA10065077	I like that the WWE is using just so it doesn't get forgotten. |`|HvnFTNmCaa	Are you kidding me ?<br>  <br>  I understand BL's point of view, but this is too much...|`|e3m3rdNYaa	i actually think the shirt is kinda cool
SV2XmB9Jaa	Randy Orton|`|wm5d9ZEUaa	Mark Henry. While he can be limited in the ring the guy is great to be aorund outside of the ring and he is funny as hell....|`|R9EMWco4aa	John Cena|`|AA10065077	As a wrestler I do not care for John Cena. As aperson he must be very caring. I remember when he was in Detroit for WM23 he made it a point to visit the make a wish foundation. He also has passion for the business.|`|vh2tuGZPaa	Cena , my brother was down in London a few years back , and he said he had a lot of time for all the fans - he said Dawn Marie was the same- I used to dislike her |`|n5X3p9cLaa	I actually agree with you on the Edge part, even when you wanna hate him as a wrestler you cant help but like him. And I have heard that he is one of the nicer superstars out of the ring<br>  <br>  I dont care for JBL wrestler wise, but he is one of the guys who always goes to the Tribute to the Troops events and that earns my respect. And the same for Cena, not my fav wrestler but probably the best heart of the wrestlers today<br>  <br>  And I am not a fan of Chris Jericho right now in the ring, but he is one guy who is a completely different guy outside the ring|`|Yy8G56j1aa	Sum1 beat me to it but i wud definetly say John Cena, the guy sucks in the ring but no1 works harder than Cena, he's great on the mic and his always out taking the company further. He was down under a couple of weeks ago and the guy seems like the most committed bloke, he goes out and cheers up sick kids. i used to hate the cena pushes, i'm all for it now, i prefer him over Y2J >=/ |`|7ugkD6iNaa	The Brian Kendrick hands down! He's a cool guy outside the ring though.|`|mWXKwjf4aa	John Cena. Bad wrestler, but has an amazing work ethic.
mK06dus9aa	Probably  Porto v Atlético<br>  <br>  The Italy v   Eng games may be interesting, tight and tactical without being particularly entertaining. <br>  <br>  Surly Real will have a game plan that involves scoring twice as a minimum, so that may cause some excitement.|`|KmMRHKTNaa	Man Utd and Inter, since they are 0-0, and anything can happen.<br>  Another great game will be REal Madrid vs liverpool<br>  <br>  Dont forget porto vs atletico and villareal vs panathikos....|`|8UOkX4Jnaa	Yeah Man United vs Inter sadly I won't watch the games because they come while i'm at school, I REALLY HATE SCHOOL!!!|`|lCHcKdbXaa	yeah any of the italian-english games|`|MxfjoVrMaa	I think that Manchester United v Inter Milan will be the most entertaining Champions League game to watch. I think this because the first leg finished 0-0, so both teams will be trying to score goals. If Inter Milan score, they could go through on away goals and then Manchester United would have to score two goals. For this reason it is going to be a very tight game and this should make it a very entertaining one too.|`|AA11617573	Manchester vs InterMilan,<br>  <br>  Hopefully the scoring breaks out.|`|IJvwYe1yaa	I'm mostly looking forward to Juve/Chelsea & Inter/Man. United.|`|B4OYSIfCaa	All the Italian teams vs English teams, especially watching Inter lose against ManU.|`|CgVCMzuUaa	Real Madrid vs. Liverpool. I want to see Madrid lose :D (once again lol)<br>  <br>  ah! I almost forgot Inter vs. ManU. I'd like to win Inter.

It can hold 90,000
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I'd love to see Jericho verbally attack Dusty Rhodes.  If there's one man in wrestling who can out-talk Chris Jericho it's the American Dream.<br>  <br>  Cody's improved a lot, and he still is improving, but I don't think he can hang with Jericho in the ring yet.  If he beats Jericho, the fans will support him; if Jericho beats him, Cody will get sympathy from the fans.  If Ted Jr helps Cody, then the fans will likely side with Jericho.  In each case, one of them will lose his heel heat.  Not what the WWE wants.<br>  <br>  And Randy is very busy with Triple H.<br>  <br>  Ted Dibiase Sr retired from the ring due to neck injuries.  Cowboy Bob still wrestles, but he was released from the WWE about three years ago.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, Dusty has no injuries preventing him from getting in the ring.  And to keep the heel heat on Jericho, Cody, and Ted Jr, Dusty would have to be the one to face Jericho in the ring.<br>  <br>  Maybe Dusty's got one more Texas Bullrope match in him?|`|SJZDv8v2aa	my opinion is he takes it to far and  new inductee 'stone cold steve austin' who the day b4 wrestlemania becomes a hall of famer. takes jericho out and challenges him to a match saying if he wants to beat up hall of famers beat me up!<br>  this match i wouldlove 2 see!!!|`|PniPsDmGaa	if Jericho does that, he will be in big danger at WM. Not only will the son of that legend will fight Jericho, but another superstar of Legacy will also fight Jericho.|`|9UHQSwDLaa	Well, lately he has been attacking ppl that are going in the Hall Of Fame. I bet he will attack the next person in the Hall Of Fame... But Jerry Lawler will stick up for them (my guess)|`|6ueL0gkAaa	The Honky Tonk Man|`|lz7oTQNXaa	hmm im not too sure to be honest, wont be bob orton because randy is a heel, wont be dusty rhodes because cody is heel and it wont be ted dibiase, because his son is heel also.<br>  <br>  What Will Happen If He Atacks One Of Those 3 ??? i personally cant see it ever happening but if it did im sure that son would defend their dad.<br>  One Legacy Member Face Y2J At WM ??? i would liek to see ted dibiase defend his dad if it came down to it.|`|XFyIssKjaa	That would be great and I'm sure the son would retaliate.  The only thing is, whoever's father YJ2 would attack, the son would become a face for sticking up for his father.|`|84yfLzM9aa	That would be great! I think that would get the fans on their feet. But it would be hard to do since Legacy and Y2J are heels and The Legends will most likely be faces. So have Legacy beat up The Legends.|`|JaCkDgWhaa	then randy orton will kiss his *** and say it was an accident saying he has ied yeah right if that happens i hope Y2J kicks ortons ***|`|nDRsK2Ugaa	legacy would jump chris jericho|`|09YK9Zboaa	That is not going to happen bc the son would retaliate, the best option for that would have been Sim Snuka retaliating for Y2J attacking his father, which didnt happen
P1mf9Zzeaa	The broncos are so inconsistent, we could easily blow this lead.  They broncos have FAR from rapped this thing up.|`|Z8hGA5Tgaa	shut up fantasy queen I only see you on Charger questions to bad mouthed them and talk trash. Oh the Chokers how original and what team do you like is it the Titans or Giants which one band wagon jumper or let me guess it is the Broncos cause they finally are going to the playoffs even though I have never seen you support them. This guy is being a loser impersonating Norv Turner so why do you care he says the most idiotic things anyway. |`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Because they know the Ed Hochuli is going to fly into Denver for the annual Bronco Christmas Party... Look for this DVD coming soon from NFL Films... "Better to be Lucky than Good-The Story of the 2008 Broncos"... I am waiting for the Blu-Ray.|`|IYm9a3SUaa	You also have to lose to the chiefs again.|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	they will go 2-3 out of those 5 games<br>  <br>  chargers win the division|`|IzAl4ctWaa	The Colts will beat the chokers on Sunday, best bet of the week (maybe year), and then the chokers will be 3 games out.  Seems pretty simple.  You do realize that norvy is still the coach and will be again next year also so you can write off next year also.  I am so glad you got rid of Marty ball and those terrible 12-4 and 14-2 years.  Boy he didn't know what he was doing.|`|89a25ac471870b73f1cee3d772e7bc2eaa	Um, that was kinda confusing lol<br>  <br>  I was about to write some not-so-nice things, but then I realized that you're being sarcastic. I think...<br>  <br>  Well, if you are being sarcastic, then yes we do have a very easy schedule and I look forward to watching my Broncos in the playoffs! Philip Rivers and the Chargers are gonna be crying in a few weeks.|`|AA11541333	cause the Raiders and the Cheifs are completely out of the playoff race. then you've got the chargers who arent doin so hot, but u cant give the Broncos an automatic bid just yet. the Chargers are real sneaky and can come and steal that AFC West Championship. if teams could get pressure on Jay Cutler then the broncos will easily fall.|`|Stq4J2Nbaa	You should thank Norvitis and the Chargers owner for firing Marty...that has to go down as the worst decision in sports history.  There is no way a team with that many good players should be having that much trouble.|`|BxWNrYI8aa	I say they are going to lose to the jets and bills, but we still have the afc west out of reach...time to look forward to the playoffs.|`|RqRruAIbaa	The Broncos will win it even if they lose 4 of their last 5 games.  That division is pathetic.  You got Oakland, KC, and the underachieving Chargers.|`|60534ad637bb9eeb3a3f4a6859dbba83aa	Emphasis on the "mighty" in mighty raiders. There's no chance the Broncos win that. No chance. 
hj5IdvHUaa	That would be sweet.<br>  <br>  And w/e happens, I think Triple H is going to get his revenge and retain over Orton...he's the master of being and defending to be the champ.|`|2H3CeuNkaa	HHH would win. BUT just imagine if stephanie mcmahon was at ringside and actually helped ORTON TO WIN THE TITLE.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	that would be an idea where batista helps triple h retain, or maybe batista costs triple h saying that yes triple h was the guy who tryed to screw me like he did with randy orton.|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	Uhm, HHH will kick the **** outta orton, and not think twice bout it!|`|DvNZr4TAaa	the match should have been called off cuz of the contract|`|zXpbfBcuaa	hhh wins|`|E7TkNO00aa	I hope that happens and let Triple H be the weiner. (winner)|`|41WXZPnCaa	Amazing But I Just That Orton Losses Please God lol Just Kidding|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Batista said in an interview that he's ready for wrestlemania but if he comes at the end of the match it wouldn't be epic like it should be because it should just be orton vs HHH in a fair wrestling match to see who really is better than the other. If Batista came it would totally kill this storyline and what would orton do after wrestlemania. HHH might not put others over all the time like undertaker HBK etc but he is known to put others over at wrestlemania and he hasn't won since wrestlemania in 2003. I think Orton is going to win maybe have a little longer feud with HHH and than when Batista returns he's most likely going to beat Orton like Cena did when he returned.|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Good theory, but no, Batista won't be back for quite some time. Earlier than expected, but still, far after WrestleMania.|`|86kZ5uYwaa	That could happen. But I hope it doesn't. <br>  <br>  <br>  Orton's gonna win!!!|`|b5c261dfe3ee5e5442b8195afe51a0b9aa	that would be good and bad ortan wins
9NDL5YQJaa	Lesnar is the guy who has the power and quickness to beat him.  Problem is Fedor can get submissions off his back which right now is Lesnar's weakness. <br>  <br>  The Barnett v. Lesnar fight hopefully happens this summer.  Affliction might not last too much longer.  Barnett might have the tools to beat him.<br>  <br>  *Some thought Arlovski would beat Fedor, Arlovski was getting the most of the stand-up until his attempt at a flying knee.  Then Arlovski was seeing stars and out cold.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	I'd have to say Lesnar or Shane Carwin because it just takes one of those huge ham hocks to catch Fedor and he'll be out like a light.  He was rocked by Fujita in Pride not long ago, can you imagine what a much bigger man could do to Fedor if he catches him?  It just takes one gigantic punch.  Whoever goes into the cage against Fedor will be the underdog right now but no one on earth can withstand a direct punch to the chin from a 280 lb man like Lesnar.  Second place would be Arlovski but he has a notoriously weak chin and I don't think he could avoid being knocked out himself long enough to catch Fedor.|`|df412c3bb405234c8f6a8353600d0b23aa	right now, barnett has the best chance, he's currently ranked 2nd in the heavyweight rankings, give it a year and i would say lesnar, the more he learns jiujitsu and improves his standup, the more dominant he will become.|`|JhN3o7qXaa	After seeing the last two Lesnar fights and Mir's fight against Minotauro i would say one of them.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	A grizzly bear.
pT0SjzZGaa	because they want to make the shows special. WWE has a large international fan base; however, the majority of their shows are ran in the United States. WWE wants to give fans outside of the US an incentive for attending their shows. The company is a global giant and they want to cater to fans all around the world.<br>  They'll Even Occasionally do a title change when they are overseas only to change it back on the last day of the tour|`|TAPBWPJLaa	They only go to those places 1-2 times a year...<br>  <br>  ...so in order to maintain their fanbase, they have to put on shows as close to quality as possible. Also, outside of the normal WWE fanbase (the one in the United States), the fans are much more hostile and will boo or cheer whatever they want as a whole.|`|wm5d9ZEUaa	I have always said this and have always noticed this. I mean why can't the WWE be great each and every week. But they are rarely overseas so when they do go I'm assuming they want to give these guys overseas the best show they possibly can!!!!|`|HFPfFYFZaa	If they put on shows like that 52 weeks a year the stars would last 3 months tops it would kill them|`|AA10065077	They only go over a few times a year. Also the people will cheer or boo whatever they want. The people aren't as programed as we are|`|C0cojb1qaa	i wouldnt call it a 5 star show, it was just a good show 3/5.<br>  <br>  when ur saying 5/5 then ur talking abour ROH and NOAH standards which are no where near.|`|hQbadeYfaa	Even if the WWE put on shows like that here,the Ratings wouldn't go up,it might some but not really big.They only visit those places a couple of times a year.Also over in Europe,Asia,Canada,and the rest of the world besides the U.S. pro wrestling is actually respected,honored,and tradition in places.It doesn't get treated like crap like it does here.Over there the fans are grateful,happy,and glad that the WWE is putting on a show and that they get to experience it.Here in the U.S,people are like UFc is better,that's not real,I'll give this 5 stars,this 2,this needs work,and just critique it and judge it rather than enjoy it.In the U.S.pro wrestling,WWE gets treated like a joke,crap,nothing,even in the news especially CNN.In other places in the World they are respected and loved.People here just complain and complain and the attitude era this,back then,they just complain and complain.The WWE put on all star,great shjows before here,and the ratings stayed the same or went up a little but the ratings weren't great.They  were okay.And here people watch NFL,NBA,MLB,MMA more than WWE so while the main market is the U.S.,it's not exactly the best place to be.If WWE got treated better here and the people cared and it wasn't treated the way it is here and people actually enjoyed it rather than always comparing it to back then,to the attitude era,then things would be a whole lot better.People in the U.S. don't seem to care much.It's like it's Randy Orton vs Batista,to them it's like it's not enough,not good enough.It's always make this guy champion,do this do that,get rid of them.It's like enough.The U.S fans are hard to please.For example people wanted the WWE to be more focused on inring action and lessT&A.The WWE focuses more on inring action and lessT&A,less bra and panties and then we have the divas were better back then or more T&A or something.It's never good enough.There's no plaesing everybody.You can't make everybody happy.Less and less people are watching in the U.S.You have MMA,NFl,and other things they'd rather watch.And it wouldn't matter what the WWE did,the U.S. fans would still whine and complain no matter what.Nothing's ever good enough.It can always be better.It's either the WWE is loved,respected,enjoyed,treated with class and tradition,and honor or get treated with disgust,uncaring,hatred,a joke.Just like soccer,the WWE is popular and loved worldwide except the U.S not so much kind of like soccer only more hatred toward it.|`|WK6vrkdKaa	like Donnovan T said..they ony go there what once a year so why not put on shows people will remember for that whole year in the UK and Canada..we get to see them all the time here in the states they only get once a year to see them there|`|8h5dqzf6aa	maybe because since the shows are in diffrent countries they are  better and since the shows are in the states they are worse

Another older guy is track star Carl Lewis. I would have enjoyed seeing him running deep routes on pass plays. Lewis was drafted by the Cowboys but never signed up.<br>  |`|XIhahUDHaa	I feel like Nate Robinson would be an Ahmad Bradshaw clone...and fun to watch play, because of the effort he gives and the fun and emotion he has playing. Actually that applies to Bradshaw himself on a slightly lesser scale...they are very similar now that I think of it.|`|AA11541333	jeff schmartia. he was a great tall college football player for notre dame and he went to baseball instead of being drafted into the nfl. i would have loved to see him in an nfl jersey<br>  |`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	Usain Bolt.|`|fHxpycJSaa	LeBron James was a standout football player in high school.

AA10065077	It appears as if the WWE has begun their cost-cutting process that they discussed on the conference call this past week. Along with possibly cutting the $300,000 cancer out of the budget that was set aside for Adamle, it was announced this over the span of a few days that World Wrestling Entertainment had come to terms on the release of Superstars Super Crazy, Paul London, Kenny Dykstra, Elijah Burke,D.H Smith, Lena Yada and Chuck Palumbo; they were wished the best in all future endeavors. If Adamle is gone, and these 7-cuts are added to that the company has cut anywhere from $850,000-$1.2-million, roughly. That's some Christian Cage money if they so wish.<br>   <br>      <br>  |`|CyMJj1Mvaa	Alot of people got released the past year or so..... more recently though:  Lance Cade, Super Crazy, Paul London, Elijah Burke.|`|NX7FNhCSaa	Chris Masters, Kenny Dykstra, Lena Yada, and DH Smith|`|C5KF9eMQaa	Recently<br>  Elijah Burke<br>  Lena Yada<br>  and Kenny Dykstra |`|02jBkC8Haa	                        ?????????????????????????<br>                                i don't get the question <br>                   be more pacific  man........................|`|ilklAOVzaa	be more specific...|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Lena, Burke, and Kenny,  Super Crazy, and Paul London.|`|V1O7N02saa	Most recently:<br>  <br>  Chuck Pulumbo<br>  Elijah Burke<br>  Lena Yada<br>  Super Crazy<br>  Kenny Dykstra<br>  Paul London|`|QouSk1E7aa	Elijah Burke is not useless, he just was not booked right.

They need a talented receiver. They already have a great defense, lots of cap space, a veteran QB, and an awesome running game. They just need an upgrade at WR and TO is a great option, especially losing albert haynsworth, there is plenty of cap room for the titans and a veteran coach like jeff fisher can keep him in line.<br>  <br>  by the way i just read your edit, Jeff Fisher has already anounced that Collins his his starter NOT Vince YOung.

kjCz5PYeaa	Well the finisher of the wrestler plays an important role in his career or every single match he plays...Talent counts the most hits of dis game..But i have to say if the finisher looks crappy it means there's something like a "scar" standing in middle of his/her victory..Like there won't be a heat if The Miz won a world championship or any championship by beating a super heavyweight Pro like The Big Show with Da Reality Check.. It won't have much attention or appreciation..The finisher should at least look like a risk machine or a brutal one..So to change history a pro need a lot of attention in his career which includes his/her's Finisher..<br>  <br>  BQ: Not always they get attention for flash finishers..The undertaker's tombstone piledriver is famous for its brutality..but it gained a lot of appreciation and it became famous even  though its not a flash finisher...It gains all da attention it needs when The Phenom starts measuring his opponent..But flash finishers do make a pro famous if itz used like a deadly machine  by him/her! |`|J3vufPpTaa	No, to be a champion, you don't need a good finisher. Take John Cena for example, he's a past champion, yet his finisher is an unimpressive fireman's carry. Another example of this is Batista, he has a sit-out powerbomb as his finisher, not very *memorable*. Oh, and another example is Hulk Hogan's legdrop, he was a former champion, yet his finisher was just a signature move.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I don't think the finisher is that big of a deal. When it is a memorable one...it's definitally a plus. Over-all though...I don't really look at the finisher. |`|NUehpH4yaa	well batista has an awful finisher, but that doesn't stop him.<br>  <br>  kennedy finisher use to be edges finisher, it was called downwards spiral, i think.|`|C0cojb1qaa	i would say a quick and easy finisher to apply is the best, stunner, crossface, rock bottom ect.<br>  <br>  koslovs is the headbutt of doom lol, ted dibiase has this russian legsweep finisher and cody rhodes has the ddt finisher which is quick but he really needs something else i mean the ddt everyone used to use as a normal move which got a two count.<br>  <br>  bq: well the rock had the peoples elbow which took a while to do, but yes i do prefer quick finishers out of nowhere.|`|V7LKViqwaa	I think having a memorable finishers does help, Stone Cold wouldn't be as famous if he didn't have the stunner. I agree with your bit about flash finishers, there good because you dont need to wait for a certain situation. Having said that the 619 goes down well but some of the ways they go about getting on the opponent in the situation make me laugh. But yeah a memorable flash finish works best for me|`|K2mXhSGlaa	It definitely helps. But, what about Hulk Hogan's legdrop? I think that might be one of the worst. <br>  <br>  My favorite finishers:<br>  <br>  RKO, Mic Check, Codebreaker, The People's Elbow, Tombstone Piledriver, Sweet Chin Music, Glam Slam, Samoan Spike|`|B85pe4Izaa	No, Cause HULK HOGAN does not have a Memorable Finisher. It's just a Leg Drop.<br>  <br>  And nothing is memorable is Batista's Power bomb.|`|AA10065077	Having a signature finishing move and good mic skills helps.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	Cause they really don't have one specific move yet .Yes you do it helps the storyline of your character. How about submission holds  like The Death Valley Vise applied by the Undertaker  or Curt Angle's Ankle Lock is that enough flash for ya.|`|KIOR56r6aa	no, just look at John Cena

EgLdNAusaa	Your point guard is supposed to stay back on D when everybody else is crashing the boards.  If the Point guard drives the lane, then the 2 guard should rotate back as the safety.

The Starrcade dvd has just been released, which is from WCW and has got people like Sting on, possibly something to be interested in?<br>  Could look up Sting on Wikipedia and would basically tell your friend most of the things that he'd done in his career.<br>  For watching things like Sting and NWO I'd suggest going on youtube, they've got loads of clips and matches. Sadly I don't anything that explains them in one whole thing, like in video or anything. There's a old NWO VHS going around but hard to get hold of and wouldn't say everything because NWO reformed on WWE for a while after WCW.<br>  Shouldn't be hard to find things to show on NWO, they're one of the most famous things in wrestling history, virtually everybody knows of them.|`|MVvxfEIzaa	just find clips of youtube.com<br>  <br>  here is a link that would help <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(professional_wrestling)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_O...</a>|`|FPuFDrZDaa	I think wwe actually put out an nWo video a few yrs. back, after the latest wwe reconstuction/deboccle of the faction.

Varejao played okay but not great, Ilgauskis played terrible, and Hickson wasn't even a factor. Joe Smith wasn't great either. All of them, though were nowhere to be found on defense and couldn't stop the scrubs that the Celtics put out there.

Y8i7NfF6aa	put in ginn and Lee Evans.  Ted ginn jr. has been running all over defenses and picking up huge yardage and a lot of touchdowns all season.  Camarillo though productive is no plaxico burress or Lee Evans.Plaxico is a solid player but u can afford to sit him out one week because Ginn is going to get more points against a pathetic oakland defense than Plaxico will against a tough ravens defense.  Lee Evans has to be in the starting line up because he is going against a weak cleavland secondary which allowed 447 passing yards to the broncos last week.|`|Nl80pGCsaa	Don't bench Plaxico, ever.<br>  <br>  I'd start Ginn over Camarillo especially if your league allows return TDs or yards.|`|xipzB5Tgaa	Ginn returns kicks too, go with him. Hard to believe anyone would bench Burress. I wouldn't.
EgLdNAusaa	A good point guard has to be the most unselfish player on the floor.  His main job is to diburse the ball and keep everybody else involved in the game, only looking for his own shot less then 20% of the time.  If you are a good shooter and like to shoot then the two guard may be more your strong suit.  If you are concerned that the other players are getting to shoot more then you are, you don't sound like point guard material.  I coach High School Basketball, this last season my point guard had 130 assists and was fourth in total points on the team.  The next closest player in assists had only 36.  My 2 guard lead the team with 255 points and only 28 assists. Because of my point guards unselfish play and keeping the other players involved in the offense by getting the ball to the open shooters we went 18 - 3 overall and gave ouselves a chance to win in all three of our losses.|`|ZBQN8viuaa	you shoot well, and you dont get the ball alot....small forward or shooting guard|`|XFLmcXSKaa	I would say SG<br>  You gotta love guys that have range|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	shooting guard|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	It depends on what positions the other players on your team play. But if I were you I would just play shooting guard and show that PF and C that you are a reliable shooter.

He's been in this business for a long time and came back to the business that he loves. He should have good feuds and have good storylines and more championship opportunity matches and he does put on a good show in his matches. I think wwe letting Big Show be in the main event was a good idea.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	He's smart, talented and does great promos. On the downside, he has put on too much weight and cannot do all the wrestling holds and wrestling moves that he could do when he was younger.

The was so awesome and totally real. They had to make sure they filmed it right the first time cuz that guy totally died for real. He agreed to just do the movie for his family to get the money. He was old and stupid anyway. <br>  <br>  On to street fighting. The best thing to have is a ninja sword and the thing it goes into has to be black. I forgot what it's called but I know it's important for it to be black. It makes it faster and more deadly. When the guy come at you you just cut him in half like ninja gaiden. Believe me it works!!! I tried on a piece of newspaper once, so I know it totally rules. <br>  If you have to fight without a weapon just use that open hand strike to his nose and drive that bone into his brain. Works every time and it's easy to do.<br>  <br>  The chi thing is the only thing you might need to get it's own video for. I suggest Judomofo's Chi development system. It taught me how to throw fireballs just like ken from street fighter. But you have to make sure you yell hadooken really loud when you do it or it doesn't work. After 4 lessons I learned how to do that spinning kick thing ryu does and breathe fire like the indian dude that nobody ever plays. I can even do no armed push-ups. Like 368 in a row with out stopping... pretty good huh, how many can you do without stopping?<br>  <br>  Not only could he make the sun go away but Bruce Lee could fly, walk on water, beat up chuck norris and superman at the same time using only his thumbs. The only one who comes even close to his fighting prowess in kimbo slice. But even kimbo can't fly..... yet.<br>  <br>  I'm about to put up a bunch of videos of me doing awesome stuff on youtube to let all the chicks see how f***ing cool I am, so if you wanna wait for that you can learn how to do all this awesome stuff<br>  <br>  You gotta use cool music that gets played on the radio all the time as your fight music<br>  <br>  and backflips are a must for all serious fighter. If you are a good fighter you can just do it like me... I can't teach you it just happens, noob!!
lz7oTQNXaa	heres my personal opinion.<br>  <br>  best: would be joey styles, now this guy back in the ecw days would call matches by himself and know every single move that was applied, he knew the correct names for moves which is awesome, best commentator i ever listened to.<br>  <br>  worst: this was a toss up between jerry lawler and micheal cole and i will say micheal cole, now this man hasnt learnt anything, he thinks a powerslam is called a scoop slam he is that bad.<br>  he also states the obvious and is probably one of the most hated commentators in the wwe among fans.<br>  <br>  most overrated: i would also have to say jim ross, personally there were and are commentators sooo much better than jr, i think they built jr as the best commentator that ever lived but that is far from the truth.<br>  i believe joey styles, gorilla monsoon, gordon sollie and even the great bobby heenan.<br>  <br>  honour mentions: jbl, mr perfect and matt striker on ecw who is fantastic.|`|InJ5SKd5aa	best: Matt Striker, I know hes not being doing it that long but the fact he makes Todd Grisham bearable to listen to is testament to how good he is.<br>  <br>  worst: Mike Tenay, watching WCW and TNA I honestly still cant stand his voice, ur better off just muting ur tv when hes talking<br>  <br>  overrated: Mick Foley, dont get me wrong I liked him as commentator, but everyone seemed to think he was perfect at it, he wasnt that good...|`|3eb398150b3caa633f206083c78b3e36aa	Best: Jim Ross. "With God as my witness, he's been broke in half!" End of.<br>  <br>  Worst: Adamle or Michael Cole. Adamle was just crap and Michael Cole is just a walking book of cliches.<br>  <br>  Overrated: Jerry Lawler, without Ross there to play off he's just useless. Hasn't actually earned his paycheck in years.|`|XFyIssKjaa	I disagree. I love The King and Jim together, they could really get people excited and they had a good relationship together.  Micheal Cole is pretty bad, so was Mike Ademle.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Best = Jim Ross, Tony Schiavone, Vince McMahon<br>  <br>  Worst = Mike Adamle, Stevie Ray<br>  <br>  Most Overrated = Jeremy Borash|`|84yfLzM9aa	Best: Gordon Solie, Jim Ross <br>  <br>  Worst: Mark Madden, Don West<br>  <br>  Overrated: Vince McMahon|`|JHw2DvgFaa	I disagree<br>  <br>  Best: Jim Ross<br>  Worst: Michael Cole<br>  Most overrated:  Joey Styles|`|9RUJ92Ydaa	JR the best|`|BAurzDXtaa	Best: Bobby "The Brain" Heenan the man was a genius he always had something witty to say and could play off of the other announcers really well.<br>  <br>  Worst: I agree with you on this one Mark Madden was really annoying and always said the most ridiculous things ever.<br>  <br>  Overrated: Mike Tenay for a guy that is called "The Professor" he sure does look like he's confused all of the time for some weird reason. He was good in WCW when he could play off of the other announcers but in TNA he sucks.|`|R4dXxh6paa	wow, we have now officially reached a rock bottom....talking about overrated announcers....lol|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	Best=  JR and Vince McMahon.  Because of the surprise and excitement they both showed while announcing, it made the matches themselves more interesting.<br>  <br>  Most over rated= Mike Tenay.  Dude knows his wrestling moves but because he over analyzes everything, he makes the matches less interesting.<br>  <br>  Worst= Mick Foley.  Dude was very entertaining as a wrestler but just plain sucked as an announcer.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Best: Gorilla Monsoon<br>  <br>  Worst: Steve "Mongo" McMichael baby!!!!<br>  <br>  Overrated: Jim Ross. He's been crap for years.<br>  <br>  Underrated: Tony Schiavone.|`|LuhTYk0Maa	the best is black snow ( booker T in TNA)  and bobby heenan ,  overrated would be michael cole, and the worst is todd grisham with his great pop for christian.|`|86kZ5uYwaa	Best- Michael Cole, (when he's not saying everything is vintage)<br>  <br>  <br>  Worst- Don West<br>  <br>  <br>  Overrated- The King
Cl6KbcAGaa	You have a well spec'd bike here and with 4" travel in the rear you dont want to start using this bike for freeride and downhill it just isnt made for it! Keep the tires mostly on the ground with this one, yes you can take some moderate jumps but do not make it a habit all the time as the frame will give before you do over time. This bike is made for XC racing only and you can jump but keep the drops to a minimum of 4-5 feet from level to incline as the wheelset is double walled but not the stiffest wheelset that you can buy for jumping purposes. This bike was meant to race and take the bumps and divots of the trail rather than fly over all of them. You can easily max out 4" of travel depending on your weight and where you set the sag on the rear shock. Just because it is full suspension does not give you a license to abuse this bike (even though you paid for it) Too many people buy bikes and disreguard the advise given them and use the bike for uses other than what it was built and designed for and then wonder why they break on them. I am familiar with the specs on your bike and the build of it. Keep all that curb jumping in check Im not saying you cant do it just remember it costs to have a wheel trued and they can only take so much. The best bang for you buck would be a better wheelset on this bike!|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	My wife has an older xcr comp and while it is meant for XC and fairly aggressive trail riding,I can attest this same bike has gone off drop offs up to about 3 feet with no issues. But I wouldn't recommend a steady diet of these for this bike, unless the landings have a good run off.
AA12213253	When studying 5 animal kung fu I learned to "steal the peaches" which is a groin attacking technique. No need to explain what it is...the name alone should give you some idea.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	They are forbidden techniques practiced only in the art of Tae Queer Do created in San Fransisco.<br>  <br>  Use some common sense and think about it. Neither one of those things, even if they existed, would be effective at all. I'd take whatever your friend says with a dash of wasabi. They don't exist.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Any orifice is legal striking or ripping ground in a street fight, and certain styles of kung fu teach those methods.<br>  <br>  Groin strikes, grabs, and/or tearing is taught in all self-defense courses as an escape from a rear bear hug, head lock etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Avulsion techniques: (skin ripping, ear ripping, genital ripping) are all part of the martial arts.<br>  <br>  And Shaolin kung fu has the best training for groin protection:<br>  <a href="http://minx.cc/?post=243812" rel="nofollow">http://minx.cc/?post=243812</a>|`|7e730f6436a4fbf1ea59232ed326b671aa	Sounds to me to be more BD/SM with a little CBT than Martial Arts.|`|4mpO3i8vaa	Sounds like your friend is a homo. I'd keep your distance if I were you!  LOL|`|7u4MuA3laa	One wonders whom one would practise on in order to perfect the technique!<br>  <br>  A lot of martial arts techneiues were designed for the battlefield where the nether regions would be pretty well protected.<br>  <br>  Also, I suspect that cultures like Japan and China would treat their martial arts with too much respect to allow this sort of technique to be developed.<br>  <br>  Your friend is having you on - or somebody is spoofing him!|`|7qtlro8eaa	He's messing with you. Although, in HS wrestling there was this 'move' going around called the 'oil check.' That's when you stick your finger up the guy's *** to get him moving or to give you some space. That was happening a lot in the south and midwest, and now the move is offically illegal. <br>  <br>  As for weiner-holds, they're not martial arts techniques so much as foreplay. |`|FMEHpZZFaa	I think that either your friend is playing a trick on you or he wants to play with you. Suggest that you do not bend over in front of him.<br>  Now to seriously address your question. Any strike on a male of female to the genitalia will be painfull. In self defense classes I instruct women that if the groin is an open target... then grab on as hard as they can and pull as if they were trying to rip that body part off their attacker. Believe me it will be painful.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  |`|3bb72213623fa8dd19d1063552cb9272aa	LOL! Don't know, but the anal lock sounds pretty devastating.|`|8U1aivfwaa	Gay Fu<br>  <br>  no, there are no such holds as these!
56uR1m8Zaa	Firstly, i'll say i respect everything you just said and i will happily take on the challange. I dont think he deserves it just yet. Now, im not a hater, infact, i like Cena. The problem is, with Cena having that shot, hes taking the space of someone else having it. They could have easily used Survivor Series as a chance to bring up another upper midcarder to main event spot light. If anyone deserves it, i think CM Punk does. His title reign was a joke, the only person he beat properly during it was JBL. He focuses on his Wrestling in his matches, he works hard and has the package. Yeh, hes got the tag titles now but they easily could have witheld that and give him the shot instead of Cena.<br>  <br>  That is why i dont think Cena deserves it, quite frankly because someone else does.|`|RrKSqQvEaa	"Shane Handed him the title shot"<br>  <br>  Kid wrestling is not real. so yes he is getting a title shot he does not deserve<br>  <br>  "Its in his home town"<br>  <br>  So what. does it matter if its in someones home town. no. that's called favoritism and shouldn't be allowed<br>  <br>  the main problem people have is every time he comes back he jumps straight into something wwhichhe does not deserve<br>  <br>  He won the royal rumble. without winning a qualifying match. he got a match at WM though he used his rumble shot at no mercy and Lost<br>  <br>  He gets a title shot without winning a no.1 contender match. just because its his hometown<br>  <br>  its reasons like this the cena fan base is crumbling. not because he can or cannot wrestle(i pass no judgment though he did injure himself by botching a hip toss<br>  <br>  Cena Haters will continue to Hate on him if he keeps getting things handed to him like this<br>  <br>  im not a cena hater nor a cena fan. but its very easy to see where everyones coming from with how overated he is by getting a title shot he clearly does not deserve.<br>  <br>  What About HBK JBL, Orton CM Punk Hell even santino deserves the title more then cena at the present moment<br>  <br>  if cena does win watch the wrestling world riot because that is sure to piss off every last REAL Wrestling fan|`|QouSk1E7aa	When someone is hurt. and then comes back then he should have to work for his title shot like everyone else does. What has Cena done to work for his title shot? NOTHING. Plus they should be putting new guys in the main events anyway. WWE has not created any main event mainstays since Botchtista. It's been he same damn guys in the main events since like 2004|`|btcbtyDnaa	dude give it up you making a big deal over something thats piss ant<br>  <br>  lmfao you 10 year old and wrestleing, grow up its fake, i watch it but i dont get pissed off when someone i dont like gets a shot<br>  <br>  deal with it god dang|`|GqFyND8Baa	just admit you have a b0ner for cena and you hate orton cause he's a heel and it be alot easier on all of us.<br>  <br>  hometowns best you got. why not give ever wrestler a title shot in their hometown|`|usN4IWI1aa	being out a few months with an injury and being over with the fans does not make u deserving of a title shot! he should have to work his way up to a title shot, not just be handed one.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	PWG is right, 100%|`|AA10065077	Alright, The WWE doesn't really have anyone else other than Y2J with the skills that Cena has. I'm just tired of the same people Orton, Jericho, HHH, Batista,and Cena always having the title. I know that there just really isn't anyone else. I'm also sick of headliners returning and their first match is for the championship. The returning headliner wins the title too. I'm not saying that they don't deserve a title shot. I just wish that the creative team would wait for a while before giving the returning headliner a title. I also feel that there are some other superstars that should be given a chance like Jeff Hardy. Sorry, if I spoiled the Survivor Series for anyone.|`|YeU5zA0Jaa	yes he does|`|1z7M3Tntaa	He didn't desreve that title shot, bcause there were other superstars that had worked hard and deserved it more. Cena didn't earn that shot, it was just given to him before he even got back into the ring.  |`|Xkm4PstOaa	How is it that Cena deserves a shot and you think that Orton doesn't?  They are both in the same situations....get your sh*t straight bro!  And yes he was HANDED the shot....Shane handed it right over to him!|`|9ijwrcTZaa	No...he needs a few matches...and wins....when he left he was losing to JBL and Batista.  Now he comes back and automatically gets a title shot.  |`|e3m3rdNYaa	ya, but i dont think your worth the time i would have to take to point out all the reasons why your wrong....|`|cU7NNfhSaa	John Cena works really hard so i say yes|`|IMu3wBu8aa	This whole Cena situation doesn't bother me all that much...BUT...I would have liked him to return when he's ready and work his way back up. I don't mind him getting this chance and getting the chance at a huge return because he does deserve it. He works his @ss off. With this whole topic...I'm leaning more towards Cena's side then all the technicalities. I want him to have a huge return, I want him to win in his hometown. It's a perfect return story. Like I said in the other question...I do think Orton should get the title shot before both Cena and Batista.
M0qoqvJbaa	Try both, see which fits you better.  It's a very personal taste, not everyone has the same preference.|`|AVTXclXqaa	Boxing is way better then kickboxing or mma. Boxing takes more skill.|`|4pyizcP5aa	often those in mma will train in both boxing and kick-boxing as both disciplines have different techniques to offer|`|2cnDm4QKaa	Depends, would you want to get kicked in the grill? If so, maybe kickboxing would be a good route!|`|nbHRfwAjaa	Kickboxing of course.   Why limit yourself on punches when you can kick butts.|`|KslfBKo4aa	Muay Thai|`|0gzhPRTDaa	boxing more popular, make more money if you want to fight and kick then just go to the ufc.|`|l2bwaHA3aa	boxin dude
QuGTZJIVaa	I hope so, always had a soft spot for 'Dale and look for their position occasionally.<br>  <br>  They really need to push onwards for that 3rd automatic promotion spot as i'm not sure if they would be victorious in the play-offs.<br>  <br>  Good luck to them|`|qO7nbSQVaa	It will only be for 12 months and they will then return|`|jiFHJ6daaa	hahha..............never want...........sooooooooo........|`|kxMQXhuAaa	It's possible but that defeat at Bury could be costly.They may have to settle for the play-offs,which will be tough to win.
N7fNwIQSaa	No i hadnt seen them, its nice to see and Silvestre too<br>  <br>  FQ: ummmm its hard to say, i think the inconsistency has come from other things though like the whole Gallas thing as well as injuries because having injuries cant help|`|ZdpaUoteaa	did somebody say Asenee should "break the bank"?......now come on thats like asking Homer to fix the credit crunch,,,he"s even asking for police protection for his "stars" cos someone left a bag behind them......yes Arsene that should distract the fans for a while,,,,no wonder NASA has increased its search for intelligent life!!!<br>  <br>  C"MON  BURNLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4BppP7Mkaa	I've seen the pics glad to see cesc back in training. <br>  <br>  FQ: That's the reason. I mean any team who are missing players like Fabregas, Walcott, Eduardo and Rosicky will struggle.|`|FG9fIQL3aa	FQ: No, although I wish I could say yes! We beat Utd and Chelsea with our team, so they are clearly good enough. They sure would have helped thouhg!|`|A6P5ibwJaa	Yes, I have seen those pics. Thanks!<br>  <br>  FQ: No I really don't. With or without Fabregas and Walcott we still would have been in the same situation, it already showed in the beginning when they were not injured. The problem is more about the replacement for Hleb and Flamini. I don't think they have been fairly replaced with Diaby, Song or Denilson.|`|eaf82079d386f1be514388360f3d4ae2aa	during world cup, brazil has soooo many injuires<br>  including ronaldo being out for ages<br>  and i thought that might be why they weren't doing so well<br>  but... in the end, they just weren't playing up to their normal level<br>  my fave team since i was 8 years old <3 and always will be<br>  but damn<br>  they sucked in 06<br>  <br>  <br>  but then my team<br>  when we had a bunch of injuries<br>  we played really well<br>  soooo idk<br>  injuries are just an excuse<br>  other teams are just getting better<br>  <br>  <br>  ac milan <3 & brazil <3|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	Yes Fabregas is great - the reason you're in fifth is you dont score enough goals, relying on van Persie and a benched Adebayor. You need an extra forward to give you good cover. <br>  Arsene should break the bank for a top class goalscorer  no?|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	i wouldn't blame it on the injuries,we completely turned over man utd,chelsea and liverhoof and the spuds were lucky to get draws from us,i think it was lack of imagination against lesser opponents to turn possession into dominance into victory,wenger wasn't brave enough to give a run to merida,ramsey,randall,lansbury even wilshire who i believe are a lot better than the song denilson partnership which are too defencive,if you watch em they always play the ball sideways instead of defence splitting passes,we weren't lucky in front of goal as well how many times did i see goalies have blinders against us,every single game i saw they were brilliant,these are my views i'm not saying i'm right but as an avid fan and very emotional when i see teams like hull get points or losing a 2 goal lead against the spuds it says something about the selection than the bad luck of injuries,these teams should be scared of us not play like it's their cup final,we should kill them off within 20mins like the good ol days|`|jiFHJ6daaa	I dont ned to......|`|Oj9ITMSFaa	You have only to look down the bench and look at the players not available through injury and you soon realize why it has been such a tough season in the league. I don't care who you are man u, you any of them, you take out five regular first teamers and you are going to struggle.

J3vufPpTaa	John Cena. Batista has no passion for the business, whatsoever. John Cena, at least has a great passion =)|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Cena, that guy has so much passion for the Business|`|bSsBGrZVaa	JOHN CENA|`|IMu3wBu8aa	John Cena. You never hear bad things about him from the fans and the locker room. The passion he has pours out of him. He works really hard and tries the hardest. I don't want to completely rule Batista out because he isn't as bad as people make him out to be. I do believe Cena is more respectable though. :)|`|Rc5oLRXAaa	I personally don't like John Cena but i think he has earned to where he is today. Same with batista. but i think that there an equal. they both debuted in 2002, the both have a royal rumble and a wrestle mania championship victory. so yeah.|`|6LQNK51uaa	John Cena is a hard worker and respects this buisness.He doesnt demands for a push like Boretista is doing.Even his greatest critics respects this guy for his determination and hard work.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	They both are, til one of them turns heel, Batista been a heel before in Evolution,maybe its Cena's turn to turn heel.|`|zmDopvd4aa	John Cena has more respect for people and is a nicer guy and plus he has a better moveset and also tries harder and has more commitment and passion for the wrestling buisness than Batista and Cena works hard on his Mic and Wrestling/Technical skills even if he is not the best wrestler out there in WWE at the moment and all Batista does is complain, whine and disrespect people backstage and is a bit of a bully I also believe Cena deserved everyone of his title riegns whereas Batista doesn't deserve any Championship runs because he is boring, laughs during his mic time, tries to be funny and charismatic when he isn't, doesn't bother with fans, botches a lot and uses steroids as no man can get that much muscle with out the roids whereas Cena is as big as you can get without using roids because he puts in 150% and gets 100% at least back<br>  <br>  So I would say without a shadow of a doubt that the more respectable WWE superstar is most definitely Cena|`|0DehGD4Uaa	no a question at all. Cena all the way, just look at the set backs Cena's been through, he fought through a knee injury, torn pectoral, and now that herniated disk and he keeps coming back. look at everything he has done with the make-a-wish foundation, he's set records for contributions. <br>  <br>  unlike Batista, he's on of the biggest jerks in the backstage area. he doesn't make time for the fans at all, if u meet him on the streets he just shines u on as if he is better than you.|`|5krBxeY8aa	John Cena...as he is very passionate about the business, and tries so hard all the time.....he gives his all in every match, and tries to entertain the crowd....which i respect very much....you never hear anything bad about Cena, he is loyal, and kind to the fans, and treats them well, you don't hear any bad comments from the other wwe guys either.....xx|`|f9BRmMNVaa	John Cena.  He tries really hard.  Batista apparently, via rumors, nags a lot and actually disrespects ppl.  So idk.  Based on guess, I would take Cena.|`|kjCz5PYeaa	Well Cena works his own azz of for the growth of the industry he works..But he still gets hated! Batista!? it would be better if i don't waste my words on him!|`|dOEnB1AVaa	John Cena first then Batista My opinion only |`|SV2XmB9Jaa	for me  it,s Batista<br>  <br>  but john cena is also a good man|`|9f6vNzCYaa	You get what you give, so Batista and John Cena love their fans, they<br>  Just don't have time to shake a lot of hands is all.|`|1MGRzrKhaa	In my opinion its John cena...he is nice and good .....batista is good too but he overreacts...and he also not too good then john cena..cena is the best...|`|7ugkD6iNaa	John Cena because he has a better attitude than Batista.|`|AA10065077	John Cena I've never heard anything bad about him.|`|mWXKwjf4aa	John Cena.

d39gB8wFaa	Yes, absolutely both Lee and Clark should still play test matches! And both should be (if both fit) on the Ashes tour! Lee is still an excellent bowler, as he in fact proved against NZ only a few tests ago, before he injured his foot, and Clark, great line and length, and in fact would've been picked for the South African tour had he been fit! <br>  Though Johnson is bowling excellently atm, he did struggle towards the back end of the Aussie summer, namely due to fatigue, so we need another out and out quick bowler to support him (ie: Lee) and also with bowlers like Siddle and Hilfenhaus, only their first few tests, and they haven't really yet proven themselves, so I think experience would definitely be a key in selection, thus Clark should also keep playing tests, and be on the Ashes tour! :)<br>  <br>  Ad.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	With Lee, it's a matter of whether or not he regains previous form. if he was bowling 150, taking wickets, yes, he would come back in. My opinion is he will not....<br>  <br>  With Clark..he's around 34..he would have to prove himself at FC level.<br>  <br>  Geeves and Bollinger are untried at this time...Lee could easily move ahead of them...then Hilfy and Siddle are not alwys guaranteed their place always.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I think there is still room for them, but they will have to come back fully fit. Brett is going well, but I don't know about Clark.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Before the two series' against SA I would have said that both Clark and Lee would be walk ins to the test team. Now with Johnson bowling like he is amd the back up he is getting, I think they will be hard pressed going to England.<br>  <br>  Of course if MBTM has his way he will have Johnson banned. We don; know what for,|`|AA11088802	yes|`|5GUjFJjkaa	Direct.tiger your a racist.<br>  <br>  At the moment they have no chance.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|JC9wAaOsaa	Clark - Yes... Lee Im not soo sure, he would certainly be looking at the attack right now n thinkin holy crap its gunna be hard to get back in... Johnson is bowlin as quick or if not quicker, n doesnt bowl 39 no balls a match|`|9W6TRPQVaa	Lee offers the team nothing they don't already have but Clark helps to build up pressure with his line and length and movement off the wicket.  He could replace McDonald quite easily and give the team more balance.|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	Yaa they still play well so they have place.<br>  <br>  Hey you, don't say bad words.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	I think there's room for Clark, but for Lee not so sure...|`|7T4dvrm3aa	lee shud play not too sure about clark|`|tz7JEqstaa	He's gone now, bye bye racist and MBTM.
gF6pgy8raa	I agree the Rams will take an OL, but I think it will be Jason Smith. He outshined Monroe at the Combine. I think Jenkins stock dropped after the Combine so he may drop out of the top 10. Rey Malaluga will not go in the top 10 either. The Jets will not take Laurinitis. They don't need an ILB or an OLB. They have Bart Scott and David Harris inside, and Vernon Gholston, Calvin Pace, and Bryan Thomas. Emanuel Cook is not a 1st round talent. You have Peira Jerry going to both the Bucs and Colts. Giants will likely take a WR round 1.|`|IOpOEMnQaa	I think the lions will take Curry anybody inside Michigan will tell you that including their beat writer Tom "Killer" Kowalski while anybody outside Michigan thinks their going with Stafford but trust me we won't we learned our lesson with Harrington and i think Raji will go earlier other than that it looks pretty good|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Lets see:<br>  The Raiders will not take Michael Crabtree because he didn't run the forty. The Raiders practically draft their players based on their forty time.<br>  <br>  Other than that its pretty good.|`|Boc1Buuwaa	Jason Smith will go 2nd<br>  Jets will snag Tyson before the Bears, Lauranaitis isnt needed in NY, (Bart Scott, David Harris) <br>  Jeremy Maclin will go MUCH higher <br>  <br>  Other than that its alright|`|q9D1mCJnaa	Lions will take the sure pick in a Linemen and that will throw your whole draft off<br>  Eagles will pick a TE with their 2nd first round pick and Giants go for a WR|`|acaAycEXaa	It's terrible.

RNr2xeDHaa	Not a Manchester United fan, but i am a fan of Sir Alex Ferguson, i can appreciate a good manager and give total credit for what he has achieved and what he is still achieving at the moment at Man United.<br>  <br>  As for leaving this season, even if (IF) they win all five competitions, i dont think hes ready to retire yet, he was quoted in one of the papers this morning as saying " Ive been on the train for so long, if i get off i fear my body will just collapse" ... he wont be leaving Manchester United, hes happy where he is, they are very happy with him. <br>  <br>  Hats off to the greatest manager in the World at the moment.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Nope not the ECL or FA Cup.  It's too many games even with a large squad. I don't think anyone can replace SAF.  Am outsider would want to rebuild the team his way and some of the players would want to leave.  As for promoting from within, that would be okay as long as the current team is together but once it comes to replacing key players I see a struggle for a few years.  I think Phelan is too well in with the players, they might have trouble respecting him as the boss.|`|HxET88bDaa	Come on now, have you not watched or read his interviews? Even when he has won everything many times over he still feels the hunger. When that hunger has gone then it is time to retire but that is why he is still going, the man still have it in him. It might be possible he leaves at the end of the season but i still don't think so. <br>  <br>  Mike Phelan might be good but i am not clear about his style of management as he has only been an assistent. Brian Kidd, Steve McClaren and Queiroz have all tried there hand at team manager and haven't had the best of luck even if McClaren had some ok moments with Boro. <br>  <br>  I always struggle to think of replacements as it's too hard. We all think a former Utd player would be good, but Fergie wasn't a Utd player and he has done good. Same with Busby, who was a Liverpool player. Strachen might be an option, as would O'Neill and Bruce etc....but i think it will be none of them....|`|jiFHJ6daaa	It looks so.............but I never want so to happen|`|p8lB73rdaa	My tip believe it or not would be Steve Bruce .<br>  The job is going to be a bit of a poison chalice because it's highly unlikely<br>  that anybody could fill Fergie's boots but for me Brucie would be a good replacement .
8UTJ0kFNaa	He should go to Europe and let them build an NFL Europe team around his ego. Every week he could play where his ego is unchallenged.

HAHA<br>  <br>  @sergio: your probably only from the few of Americanistas I respect, pero even you know que la seleccion sin jugadores del Chivas is not the same. And i wasnt cocky when Chivas beat Pachuca, yes I was happy, but you didnt hear me say "ahora si campeones" unlike ur boy over that dosent see reality and cant admit that your guys teams blows right now. I admit, i was confident that we were going to beat Caracas, and the only excuse i gave was the team played like crap because of the dumb subs. Pero t garantizo ke en el jalisco le vamos a poner en la madre al caracas, y si no me trago mis palabras y lo acepto.<br>  <br>  @wolverine: the point I was trying to make with that, is that thats the excuse thats is always used by Americanistas. I dont use that excuse cause thats stupid, I said in a way to say if u can make a dumb excuse I can also. I dont care how many points we have at the moment, or who we lost too, of course I care that we win/loose/draw but I care more how my team plays. And in all honesty even when Chivas lost 3 in a row they were playing good, pero no metian los goles. Unlike las guilas, they play like crap, and cant win....thats my POINT
JSGLKnA4aa	turn body toward target then contact ball. you'll hit straighter.|`|bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	Just remember, when you make your shot, you need to turn your hips and make your belt buckle face the target.  Its the same for driving, iron play bunker shots or pitching.  Proper hip turn brings the club through the target and eliminates shanks.  However, its easier said than done and It happens to me often.  Practice PRactice Practice!!!|`|ThhLaA32aa	Sounds like the classic "shank" where the hosel comes through and makes contact with the club before the face.  <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  You might be opening the face up as you swing back...and then the face just doesn't close like it should...and so you end up shoot the ball to the right.<br>  <br>  <br>  Soooooo how do you fix it?  Swing full with your 8 iron....then make a 3/4 swing....then a half swing....and then start chipping with your 8 iron.  Once you get the feel and the confidence of hitting different shots with your 8 iron....take that same approach as you hit your wedge!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your game!|`|WjeE4Cx8aa	Your most likely not releasing the club; therefore, the hozzle (or the heel of the club) is leading through impact. Try to rotate your forearms through impact.|`|CpYiJOB8aa	keep your knees bent throughout the swing<br>  <br>  keep most weight on your front foot<br>  <br>  play the ball off your back foot<br>  <br>  dont try to bee fancy or get too cute with the ball.|`|8Nlcxf3Waa	Just like your usual golf swing there needs to be good hip rotation in a pitch shot as well.  If you can't finish your shot with your belly button parallel to your target line then try opening your stance at setup a little at a time until you are able to.  As far as your setup goes, it sounds as though you have a decent grasp on it.  A couple things to remember though are to distribute your weight about 60 right 40 left and the shaft should be forward pointing to the crease in your pants.  The takeaway is a bit more vertical than with other clubs but remember not to just pick the club up vertically.  Hope this helps.

Because, well frankly, no one wants T.O.|`|0XTSsephaa	They are Dumbazzes.<br>  <br>  And Randy Moss sucked on the Raiders which is a team that kills careers.  So there is no comparison.<br>  <br>  TO is a cancer, but I'd still want him on my Bears because he is an extremely talented and entertaining cancer and my Bears are no where near a Super Bowl win.<br>  <br>  --By the way, did Randy Moss's personality really change on the Patriots or did he just have higher stats?  Stats ain't personality you dumb baztards and being in a team with Tom Brady taking all the media attention will divert criticism away from Moss.|`|vnzSTerjaa	T.O. will always be T.O., no one can change him, he has had a life changing experience, NEAR DEATH! that still didnt change him, so i doubt a coach yelling at him will change anything. if a team does sign him though, i think he will be less demanding|`|GUjr6whNaa	I think its possible that a strict coach could put him in his place but i think it probably wont happen.<br>  <br>  T.O. is just difficult and doesnt take criticism well and isnt a very good team player<br>  <br>  but who knows|`|01MrZwRuaa	A strict coach with s strong personality can keep TO in check, not change him.|`|tak6xnfVaa	NO|`|Oa7lX9m9aa	Randy did it at 30. I don't see why T.O. can't.<br>  <br>  <br>  Randy wasn't selfish?LOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit-<br>  <br>  "TO is a cancer, but I'd still want him on my Bears." You're awesome!<br>  <br>  <br>  Besides the Patriots who wanted Moss? No one. I remember when no one liked Moss just like they don't like T.O. now, before Moss went to the Patriots.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I don't think any sensible person thinks a strict coach will change who TO is. Nothing is going to change that, ever. What a strict coach will do, however, is prevent his drama from becoming a detriment to the team. He won't let TO take over the locker room. In that type of situation, TO may not be happy, but the rest of the team should be. I don't think this is the best situation. The only way TO will be happy is if his numbers are excellent. He could be on a 19-0 team, but if he doesn't have record-setting numbers and lead the team in receptions, he's not going to be happy. He needs a situation with a good quarterback who can help him perform well, but one who isn't soft enough to take any of his selfishness if things don't go as planned. He also should avoid teams that have other receivers to steal his thunder. I think the problem in Dallas came from Jason Witten's success. TO doesn't want to be the best weapon. He wants to be the ONLY weapon. Now, I'm not saying he's in the right by wanting this, but it's the only way he'll be a healthy addition to a team.|`|9vq0oSD2aa	No way can you compare Randy Moss' attitude to Terrell Owens'. If Randy Moss is upset, he starts half-assing on the field by not fully running his routes and such; if T.O. is upset, well, he questions his quarterback's sexuality or says that the quarterback and TE are having secret offensive meetings behind his back or not letting the OC speak to him directly.<br>  <br>  Basically, the major difference between Randy Moss and Terrell Owens is that Randy is a malcontent, whereas Terrell is flipping nuts.<br>  <br>  That's my 2 for 2.|`|L3byzh3Gaa	Your right, T.O. won't change... he is the most ambiguously overrated piece of garbage the NFL has ever seen... if he'd kept his mouth shut and just played football he would be nearing most if not all of Jerry Rice's records, but he is a whining, sniffling baby. His mother must not of held him when he was a baby and now that he is a grown man needs all the attention in the world.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	He won't change, because he is a cancerous prima dona. He already played for a strict coach. It was Belicheck's mentor Bill Parcells. If you remember, Parcells didn't want him but Jones forced him on him. Bill used to refer to him in interviews as "the player".|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	"Additional Details<br>  please dont compare Randy to Owens. Randy was a nutcase, but wasnt a selfish player like Owens"<br>  <br>  ...That right there says that you don't know what the hell you're talking about...People said the EXACT same thing about Randy Moss...and he's been fine with the Patriots...
hHjh19PEaa	without high school experience most colleges are going to make you try out like a walk-on for their track team but if you are good enough to make it then it shouldn't be a problem-- that being said, you are going to have coaches in college also and it sounds like you and coaches don't get along ?|`|MDmpNumVaa	To tell you the truth, it's what you want to do. But in my opinion do what you want to do, don't let other people make you do stuff that isn't what you want to. Work hard but don't go past your limits cause then you get hurt.

Gh7vs777aa	my answer i think it's improve there standing it's long away to end this season i'm sure they make it on playoff..|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Um as a Knicks fan I would just, like to say that obviously the Knicks have proven to be better than the Bobcats. For, the Knicks have already won the season series w/ a shot of a clean sweep. Last year, I also remember David Lee hitting a crazy last second  game winner against Charlotte he always seems to bring it to Charlotte and still does it this season to Charlotte too. Not to mention I recall Knicks winning in a blowout in 1 of the 3 games this year.<br>  <br>  All the 27 to 25 games is telling me is that Bobcats played two more games than the Knicks for they are both equal in the loss column. If Bobcats were better than NY they would have given a battle in the season series matchup. But, with a win tonight Knicks are % points ahead of Charlotte cause of the  season series finally ending.|`|kTbCarenaa	i was at the game against Atlanta yesterday, and if we keep playing like we did in the first quarter, we might beat New York today. and u do have to remember, New York hasn't been playing good as of late.
q1OoJc0Laa	I think that it would be an interesting match, but JBL just doesn't seem to fit with Edge and HHH.

I would change JBL with Shawn Michaels. JBL is great, but if he became champion the WWE would be boring. JBL is better as a chaser to the title.|`|fMJUPtDhaa	Actually this would be a great match for Wrestlemania<br>  <br>  The Undertaker vs John Cena vs Batista<br>  <br>  This would be an awsome match|`|hvKQpxI0aa	Yeah I could see the end of that match.<br>  <br>  {Triple H goes for Pedigree on Edge, JBL does the clothesline from hell on HHH then JBL turns around and Edge spears him 1-2-3 EDGE WINS!!} <br>  <br>                       Rating: <br>                    10|`|82Eiuqlyaa	Take Out JBL And Put Y2J.<br>  Three Of The Greatest Heels Ever.|`|UWJinEbIaa	HHH vs Jericho vs Matt Hardy in a unification match would be better.|`|9CLRMnhSaa	take out jbl for matt hardy 10/10|`|sUYPveKUaa	4/10<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry...|`|rjWlOAnEaa	I'd give it a 10 if JBL gets replaced by Randy Orton. |`|fkG4cflhaa	10 but make it a steel cage match and Triple H won|`|GJQIL0RZaa	I like it.

John scratched, we have to look at the field a bit differently.<br>  Cowboy Cal is a winner of two straight graded stakes including the G11 Strub stakes last month at Santa Anita.<br>  <br>  Dansant actually has the best record of any horse in the field with two wins and one second place finish.<br>  <br>  Einstein has won more than 1.6 million including 3 G1's stakes and a120 ESF in the Turf Classic last May.

We will see in a bit.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Horse owner and breeder<br>  Avid horse racing enthusiast|`|A5ypQeqwaa	I like two horses Matto Mondo the first, because he can get loose on the lead, the only question is if he can go a Mile and a quarter, if the answer is no, you have to look for a closer, and that is Champs Elysees who was third in this race last year, and I think the distance suits him perfectly.|`|7mdbyjVEaa	Champs Elysees and Einstein will battle down the stretch but Einstein will get the edge for the win with Matto Mondo finishing a well beaten 3rd with Court Vision fourth. Cowboy Cal will finish way back out of the money after a bad trip.|`|8bTder08aa	I'm going to go with a longshot here and opt for Stream Cat.  He's coming off the turf, he likes synthetic tracks, he's getting a break in the weights.|`|b8754e91196200e84629988cb6632b19aa	its all about the big filly today in the oaks... all the rest matters none.
eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	if they make the playoffs, yeah|`|7X1H2AfWaa	Well this is a yes, because they are going to be in the playoffs at the rate they are going.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	most likely|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	no|`|mweN63p8aa	Yes. Im a Spurs fan and Boozer is trouble for SA. Gooden is now with the SPurs so that helps. Laker fans would tell you that if the Jazz had Stockton and Malone Kobe could beat the Jazz by himself. But you know that's how Laker fans talk. Some of them do.|`|fWMzd7y5aa	Yea, they are the 3rd best team in the West now. They have a great chance to beat the Spurs or even the Lakers to get to the finals.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	YEA!! Now that everyone is healthy we are gonna beast! I think the Jazz can go to the finals! WOO GO JAZZ!|`|NKN7HwkYaa	yup. No question about it. They are a great team and not even on most people's radar. but they if they can stay healthy they will open some eyes in the playoffs|`|2H3CeuNkaa	Of course. You've seen how they have been dominating as of late.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	yessir|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	yes, I think they will go on a run now and get the 3rd seed.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	They were on a streak before Boozer. Boozer just adds an additional plus. I knew since the beginning of the season that because D.Will, C.Booz, AK47, and Harp (all key player) suffered injuries that they will initially struggle. But, I knew that they will overtake the division cause it can be said from 1-12 they are the deepest team in the NBA.<br>  <br>  They have always been a team to watch out for in the playoffs it is nothing new. In 2007 they were 1 game away from beating the Spurs in the WCF and going to the Finals. Last, year they were the Western Conference team to beat the Lakers more than any playoff team of that conference and only 2 games away from a consecutive conference birth. This is nothing new.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	They should be, but they still have a lot to prove.  When they are healthy that have the talent to compete with anyone.  However, traditionally they've had a difficult time winning away from home, so if they don't have home court advantage, that may prove to be a barrier.  Also, San Antonio and LA have walked all over Utah in previous years.  They need to take their game to the next level if they want to make it to the WCF and possibly the NBA Finals.  For now they are still in that second tier of the top teams
7X1H2AfWaa	well , what about ucla and davidson? they are good teams. you never know, anything can happen, like when Mario Chalmers hit a miracle shot last year that took the NCAA basketball championship to overtime, where the jayhawks outscored the expected winner, the Memphis Tigers.|`|fWMzd7y5aa	The chance an all number 1 final four is usually rare. I would have to go with <br>  UConn<br>  Michigan St. (They always play their best basketball in the tournament)<br>  North Carolina<br>  Oklahoma
WK6vrkdKaa	thats a good idea, not too long ago, the WWE was thinking about doing this sometime within next yr if SD on MyNetwork TV doesnt or wont work out for a long run..but i hope they do cause id watch this 24/7|`|6LQNK51uaa	Yeah a very good idea.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	i would never watch any other station!|`|fkG4cflhaa	yes i would watch it 24 7|`|ZI8Z2NT9aa	they already have it.  its called WWE 24/7 on demand.  It rules and its only $7 a month.  they show old raws, nitro's and classic ppv's.  I love it<br>  <br>  as far as having something free like that...it will never happen as long as its ran by the mcmahons.  24/7 rules and its cheap so i don't  want to hear any complaints.  you can pay for the whole year if you don't buy the dvd's.  in this case you wouldn't have to b/c they play the dvd's on 24/7 :-)|`|XQPV44tuaa	that would be the greatest channel ever invented.  you could have like recap shows of Raw, Smackdown, ECW. And FCW (Florida Championship Wrestling) and some of the independent ones on there.  You could have specials on the big time superstars and up and coming stars. |`|AA10065077	The WWE does or did have a channel called WWE 24/7 it was only avalible on certain cable providers or you could get it streaming at wwe.com Sometimes they have really old matches on there. I believe it costs about $10 a month.  I would love it if it were free, but that would never happen.|`|sUYPveKUaa	if it existed....<br>  <br>  WWE channel=Grestest Channel in the world|`|GJQIL0RZaa	That would be great, i like the idea.|`|smcDn76jaa	That would be the end of me. I would literally have a heart attack from shock and happiness the moment that it was announced. But i guess everyone else would enjoy it.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	If they had their own network/channel. It would be on all the time in my house. I would seriously never turn the tv off lol. I really think they should do it. I have 24-7 and i love it. having a free channel...on all the tvs (not just the one that has the cable box for 24-7) would be awesome!
022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Your friends are sissies.<br>  <br>  If you wear a sweatshirt over your regular clothes, you'll be fine. Some minor pounding, but nothing you didn't experience as a kid punching each other in the arm when you played "PunchBuggies" - just now also on your chest, thighs..<br>  <br>  One thing, though: wear protection on face / groin areas. Getting shot in those places may both hurt and actually do some damage.<br>  <br>  As for avoiding getting shot, the best way is to rush opponents and kill them first. They're usually shocked and unable to react, and you can dodge the ones who manage to fire anyway if you know how to move.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  jdk|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Yes, they do hurt.  Wear padded clothing or several layers of clothing.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	they don't really hurt that much just a little sting.|`|CV963cQFaa	i've been and yeah it stings if someone shoots at you really close up, but thats not actually allowed and is against the rules. So if played properly no! I loved it, you'll have such a great time!

I wore a sweatshirt and sweats and it didn't hurt much the only time it stung was when I got hit in the hands if I didn't have gloves on. It is a blast though.|`|inST4SlAaa	i heard they sting, a lot, even though you wear protective gear
eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	to be honest, your better off searching on the web, the basketball section of yahoo answers isnt really about locations of what your looking for.
hdFMLVF7aa	At first, to me this looked like a dumb trade, until you look at it from an economical standpoint.  This trade put them close to $18 million in cap space.  Which is allowing them to make some of the moves they are making now, plus I guess they have interest in getting Peppers away from Carolina and ultimately they would need cap space to do that.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	Your right<br>  They shouldn't have traded him, because there's always a chance Brady could not play well and they could just send in Matt Cassel.  Now all they have to take over Tom Brady is Kevin O'Connell.  I think they should have kept Cassel for about three weeks into the season, and if Brady played well they could just trade him, or if he sucked just put Cassel in there and let him dominate.<br>  <br>  I actually think they could still been just as good without Vrabel as a Linebacker.|`|MwYc1YJCaa	The move was really strange, Harrison and Seau most likely won't be back, and after giving away Cassel, I am sensing a rookie might be starting the first game or whomever they have left in the depths. Pats 3rd and 4th strings don't seem to stay there long. They always get cut to make room for the WRs, DBs, and LBs.|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	we could have easily gotten a first round pick. I think the reason why we didn't get one is because before this trade we had the second least amount of cap room besides the panthers and we wanted to clear up cap space. A first round pick would devistate that cap room. I'm sill very displeased i wanted more but what can we do now but complain. GO PATS|`|B8sJEBxTaa	I did not like this move since they only got a 2nd rounder for it. However, if the Pats do get something good out of this pick or with the money they saved, then whatever...|`|Xcb6pbKPaa	the pats suck, all boston teams suck. you're all a bunch of fair-weather fans.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	Its cause Bellicheck and Pioli are butt buddies|`|qRJztNNZaa	i think they shouldnt have traded cassle he did good and i think he has the potential to be a great player|`|7oqfmk4waa	I'm not a pats fan but very dumb move by bellichech he could have got a 1rst round at least for both of them it's ridiculous|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	I think the Pats gave them away for a 2nd round pick. 1 second round pick for both of them, makes the deal seem a little shady. I don't know what Vrabel's cap number was, but could they have been trying to increase their available cap space? I'm thinking if that was not the case, then Belichek knew or suspected something wrong with both players.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Thats what I've been saying since it happened...I don't know WTF Belichick has in mind...and I don't know HOW he knows for sure that Brady will be 100%...<br>  <br>  Brady was "100%" or "fine" for the Super Bowl last year, and we know what happened there...<br>  <br>  I didn't agree with this at all...The Patriots should have waited til right before the trade deadline to see if Brady is fine...If he is, so be it...Then trade Cassel...<br>  <br>  Now, WTF are they gonna do if Brady struggles?...The season will be lost and they will suck...|`|dnwJmNkdaa	Not too bad it was too free up space in the cap and use it to get some youth in at the LB position... I think the youngest LB on the pats right now is like 94...|`|gBfPkdroaa	i think the patriots dug up their own grave for the season :)|`|mlAvI4CTaa	go steelers !!|`|xxtvhn5Naa	I'm not a pats fan... but that was a STUPID move by coach Billa-cheat.  only a 2nd round draft pick!  dang!

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure as the old Attitude Era Y2J was a charismatic legend who could work exciting matches and cut entertaining promos and in-ring segments.He also showed his flair for comedy in his feud with Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.Hopefully Jericho will revert to his original persona after WM 25.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chris-jericho-tribute/1739721421/?icid=VIDURVENT10" rel="nofollow">http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chr...</a>|`|41WXZPnCaa	I Do A Feud vs Edge Or Orton Will Be Cool But <br>  <br>  Or Edge And Orton Turn Face Or Jericho Turns Face So I Think It's Kidna Impossible|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I also miss the old Y2J because he was hilarious. It seems like he turned into a serious heel because this was the only way to get known to the kids because they didn't know him when he returned and because of this serious heel gimmick he got 2 championships in one year which i think was great. I would love to see Y2J vs Edge vs Big Show but it doesn't seem to be happening now because he'll most likely job to a legend at wrestlemania. Many of his faithful devoted fans will always love him what ever he does. The only thing i don't like about him right now is his ring attire because it's weird to see him coming out in this underwear looking attire that doesn't suit him. Jericho put some pants back at least please!|`|R4dXxh6paa	HELL YEA!<br>  <br>  Take an Edge from about the WrestleMania 21 era (the first MitB winner), and throw him with a face Y2J from oh, the same time period and a no DQ (or TLC) match and you the greatest match for the greatest anniversary of WrestleMania.|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Jericho is amazing as a heel, but he's one of the most badass faces of all time.

jSkHquK5aa	Soccer Weight training is crucial for soccer players. It helps to increase power, speed and stability. It also helps to prevent injury. if you are stronger, you will be alot harder to tackle and knock off balance. <br>  <br>  Soccer players generally build muscles on the lower part of the body, seeing as soccer is played mostly with the legs. It helps to increase shot power and speed. Although, some players like to build up on the upper body as well.<br>  <br>  This helps them to become stronger to help them in tight quarters. Stronger players are most likely to come out of scrambles than a weaker player. Soccer involves lots of shoulder-to-shoulder contact. Being stronger in the upper body can also help you to hold off defenders when trying to score a goal. <br>  <br>  The average weight of soccer players is 76kg. A lot of players that don't make professional is not that they lack skill or fitness, but because of their weight. Soccer players do lots of running. if you think about it, thats a lot of cadio. It is very important to replenish energy with proper nutrition. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hit the gyms! Get yourself out there and start your soccer weight training. You will not gain muscle mass without going to the gym. Anyone can gain weight by increasing the calorie intake, but only those who work hard can gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  In order to force your muscles to grow, you must put it under a certain amount of stress through lifting heavy weights. This triggers a reaction in the brain, causing your body to try and adapt. Your muscles will, of course, try to grow from this reaction. <br>  <br>  Do not try to lift weights that are too heavy for you. Start with what you are confortable with then gradually increase as you get stronger. Try to do about 10 reps of 4 sets for each workout for maximum gain.<br>  <br>  Rest in between workouts. This is the single most important factor in soccer weight training. Muscles grow when you are sleeping so make sure you get at least 8 hours a day. 1 hour naps after workouts can also help recovery time.<br>  <br>  Make sure to only work a muscle group once a week. For example, you've just finished working your hamstring, quadriceps and glutes. You should now rest these muscles for at least a week before working these muscles again. Smaller muscles such as the calf, bicep and abs can be worked more than once a week as they recover quicker. <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water! Muscle is made up mostly of water. you must make sure you drink enough so your muscles can grow and recover quicker. At least 1 gallon of water a day will do. <br>  <br>  Eat plenty of high protein foods and vegetables. Check out the nutrition page for more on this subject. <br>  <br>  Consistancy Dont just quit after about 2 weeks. You must be committed and keep training. its very tedious and sometimes you might feel overwhelmed. Just take one step at a time and try not to think too far ahead.|`|09SjyOHkaa	gimnasio|`|0floKHTIaa	Exercise. Daily.

zeaX8jXUaa	If he is a race-bred Thoroughbred the most likely explanation is that the letter & other numbers have simply faded away with age.  After enough years, they can become difficult to impossible to see.  That's not uncommon, especially if they didn't take very well in the first place - which does happen.  Some tattooers do a better job and some horses are more willing participants than others (i.e. they'll tolerate the needles being driven deep enough into the gum tissue to really seat the ink).  I've never heard of any other organizations using lip tattoo's for identification.  It's a hassle to do and would make their horses ineligible for racing, since the Jockey Club tattoo has to be placed there by a racing commission official.  I have seen a horse that threw such a fit while being done (even tranquilized), that they gave up on the last number before he could commit suicide.  His shortened ID number became just another method of identifying him.   They shouldn't have bothered.  He proved just as big an idiot in the paddock and starting gate.......|`|7mdbyjVEaa	Definitely not a race horse. thoroughbreds have more number and and a letter or two in theirs. I think your horses tattoo is just a brand from a farm, possibly the farm he was born on.+|`|lTeXIjpOaa	usually race horse tattoos are longer than three numbers and include at least one letter, it may be a tattoo from a ranch or farm that had a large number of horses as this is an easy way to id a horse

r5AMG8g7aa	Keep the kicks low. Kicks to the legs are effective. High kicks will either work or get you into big trouble. Personally I don't believe in high kicks to the head. Kicking the head is about like kicking a bowling ball. Not something you want to do unless you want to hurt yourself. High kicks are easier to defend against. low kicks are harder to defeat. No matter what, use common sense. It only take one mistake in the street to get you into serious trouble.|`|6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	Most kicks should go to knee of your opponent, never higher than his waist unless you have previously injured him to such an extent that he can not stop the same.<br>  <br>  Never do a jump kick.<br>  <br>  Never take your eyes off of your opponent which excludes spin kicks unless you opponent is so injured that he can not stop the same.<br>  <br>  Sweeps to your opponent's leg can be effective.<br>  <br>  Your kicks can block his legs as he kicks at you.<br>  <br>  In a real fight it is usually best to keep ones feet on the ground and use them for mobility.<br>  <br>  Be well.|`|ieUgty5Faa	I've heard a lot of people say that kicks don't work in real life, or that they don't hurt people. It was ironic to hear them say that, because they didn't know how to throw a good punch either.<br>  <br>  Well, I've kicked people in real life and dropped them, I've also been dropped by kicks and I've seen other people get hurt by kicks, too.<br>  <br>  If you are trained to use your legs, then they can be effective. The problem is that you have to know how to time and range your kicks, and know when to use them.<br>  <br>  If you don't think that kicks are for real life, go find a guy that trains in Muay Thai, and ask him if he thinks a good shin kick wouldn't work in real life.<br>  <br>  |`|L2UUj2hjaa	Hello Chucky!<br>  <br>  Kicks are effective if you are trained to use them. If you aren't trained, even a low kick can be hard to do, because everything requires proper technique. Your only chance would be going for the groin, and sure as hell not high. But kicking is only one aspect of self defense or fighting in general. It can play it's part if done at the right moment.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped! |`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Provided it is a self-defense situation, then anything goes.  <br>  <br>  If it's an "I'll meet you behind the bleachers after school" fight then you shouldn't be in it in the frist place.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	I think you should be careful when using them. I wouldn't use any Tae Kwon Do kicks to the face or anything. I would use Bujinkan styles kicks since they have the most power and effectiveness.|`|yys7EbMlaa	If you really insist on using a kick there are a few things you need to do first. Set up the kick by throwing a job or an overhand punch. Then kick low toward the knee, or thigh. Also, kicking to the inside of the thigh, (careful not to hit the groin) is very painful. Use these set-ups and low kicks to ware down on your opponents mobility. Once you've worn down your opponent your strikes will make more consistent contact. If you are going to attempt a head kick, try and time it as a counter measure to a sweeping hook or hay-maker if he throws one. |`|FMEHpZZFaa	I love using the distance and making them think twice before they attack. Keep in mind that I NEVER kick above the belt in a real fight. I always concentrate on the knees, hips and thighs. It softens up your opponent and if you can deliver your kicks with speed and power they can be an awesome weapon.<br>  Even Bruce Lee stated " I would sooner punch a man in the foot as kick him in the head..." We learn pretty kicks for tournaments and practice but in real life they are impracticle.<br>  The best use of kicks is to quickly disable your opponents legs providing you with plenty of opportunity for escape.|`|NVMSQEKQaa	the best kick to use in a real fight are low thai leg kicks or knees when in close fighting if your oppenant is on the ground stomps are the best kicks to use that way your oppenant cannot get up and continue the fight.or taking soccer style penalty kicks on there head uselly will end it pretty quickly.forget about high or flashy spinning kicks this is combat not hollywood movies.|`|2AK0TIBGaa	Any time I get in a fight and your head comes well, pretty much anywhere near my legs theres a gret chance you'll get kicked in the face. I don't reccomend high kicks though, you'll probably just fall. Last year I kneed a boy in the forehead and dropped him. So they are effective. So yes, I give kicks the thumbs up.|`|bqIrBR6kaa	It is a powerful tool when used at the right time. But one can fall while standing on two legs. How much more on one? |`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	you do what you have to do at the time.if you use kicks keep them low-to the knees etc.|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	do low kicks if you dont they may grap your foot and knock you on your booty|`|cDtb15eaaa	cat fights? sure|`|NQultkdwaa	a good kick can take an opponent out quickly <br>   be very certain before you decide to fight someone though<br>  I have kicked people in fights usually I need to end the fight quick and will use any technique I have to |`|s8bUKzjzaa	Always!!!!   Nothing is more surprising then a straight in kick to the chest!!!!!!   Followed by an uppercut or a Bruce Lee one inch punch...sends the guy flying!!  lol|`|73sNbTxIaa	kicking is good.
UYPfC5YVaa	I think China and australia are in equal footing right now. Surpass Europe and top South American countries? Based on the way Chinese officials trian theur players, it's not gonna happen on the next 5 Olympics! They focus more on recruiting tall players, unanimously 7 footers! They can't win by having only good centers. <br>  <br>  Chinese players will still be joining the NBA. A lot more! Unless the Chinese government becomes stricter to their nationals.|`|taElYijzaa	You think those like Yao. <br>  Chinese are not gifted in sport. they are interested in propaganda, to magnify the ability of their player. I've endured enough.<br>  I'm Chinese, But I never think Yao is a great player. He is efficient because he is tall. But he is too soft to lead a team.<br>      the government always use the sport and Olympics as a political show.  Then Chinese sportsmen were trained only for the goal of winning gold. They never care the benefits of the basketball team--CBA.<br>      You can see the bad system of Chinese football association.<br>  the Gov cancel any match at will for the reasons of world cup or Olympic.<br>       it is like "Great Leap Forward".  I think the disadvantages lies in its <br>  crazy government. and lack a good commercial environment.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	i think they R Better Than Australia now<br>  <br>  But i think they NEED TIME To Be better than Europe And South America|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Surpass Aussie,I guess they can<br>  <br>  But hard to surpass European and Latino

X9txA1GVaa	build leg strength. i cheered for five years and could hyper-extend my toe touches by the end. the biggest thing is that you have to get high up. the point isn't to be able to do a split, but just get your legs UP. if you jump REALLY high and really use your abs to LIFT your legs up, you'll be good. do some crunches and leg exercises to build those muscles. as far as the hurky goes, sit down on the floor with your left leg bent back like in a hurky. Really try to get a feel for how that feels, although it's hard to do in the air. A lot of girls face that knee to the ground, and it just looks like crap. really, try to get that knee out to the side. the other leg, practice doing high kicks with it. you really need to stretch that one high and it'll look good. that's my advice.|`|Dnnk3BJBaa	I can do toe touches, what I recommend to do is try it out on a trampoline and then on the ground.<br>  <br>  Thanks x

b1648XnPaa	HHH = Face<br>  Edge = Heel|`|ULSUqmeZaa	He was on top before he married Stephanie and he has the same power now that he did then. He is where he is because he is loyal to the company and same with Edge. He is still one of the best.<br>  <br>  About Hart and Steiner. First of all, Bret Hart has a lot of animosity towards HHH because of Montreal, he is very biased in how he feels about Triple H. And Steiner is a jerk. No one cares about what he has to say and it is very known that he was very jealous of Triple H and his success.<br>  <br>  He has put many people over. Batista, Cena, Orton, Jeff Hardy, Shawn Michaels (when he first came back after injury in 2002), the list goes on. You can't say he hasn't put anyone over.|`|LuhTYk0Maa	Bret hart says Triple H was the biggest butt kisser when he came to wwe in 95 and even bam bam said triple h carried everyone's bags and called him a brown noser. Scott steiner trashed triple h in a interview saying he is the kevin federline of pro wrestling because he is sleeping with the bosses daughter and it's all true about how triple h used his politics along with vince to bury the top talent in WCW like booker t in the invasion storyline ( the stone cold grocery store beat down), ddp losing matches in 2 minutes, kevin nash, goldberg , and steiner. Steiner went on to say that triple h and ric flair are butt kissing pieces of sh*t and it's so true.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Nobody cares that HHH is on top because of his family connections. Its so easy to get ahead when you're married into the family business. Edge, on the other hand, proved he could hang in the main event through hard work and dedication.|`|XcZgG9y6aa	Where have you been? I read atleast one question a day criticizing HHH. Saying he is only on top because of his wife..<br>  <br>  Well i guess i fit into your description though.. I don't care how and why he is on top. He is still one of my favorite superstars.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	I agree with you. I think that HHH is given too much power and that it isnt fair to the other wrestlers. He should wait til he retires to obtain the kinda power he possesses right now. its not fair for a wrestler to have total say so over what happens in his career.|`|I1Ieyqk8aa	He was at the top way before he got involved with Steph & anyone that knows anything about it all back then knows he worked bloody hard & took a lot crap to get there.|`|qwdh7N6saa	becaues Edge is the man.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	my personally opinion that triple h he has in the past held talent back, rvd, shelton, randy orton, kane, booker t and others because of the "clique" which were a group of guys who played the political scene very well backstage.<br>  the only guy i know who hasnt been buried was the undertaker when triple h wanted to end takers streak at wrestlemania 17.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Because HHH is an a** kisser, that's why nobody gives a sh*t about him.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Plenty of people care about it seeing as they use his relationship with Stephanie and the McMahon family as an excuse to why he is on top. The reason he is there is because he is a veteran, draws crowds, quite a good wrestler, and plenty of charisma. He may get leeway behind the scenes but so do most of the other main eventers. The final call will always be Vince McMahon so if anyone is to "blame" for Triple H being on the top it is Vince himself. I personally am not a fan of Triple H but he is quite a performer that doesn't deserve the hate he gets from the crowd seeing as in the end he does what he thinks is right for the company.<br>  Don't get me wrong, Edge is an amazing performer as well. He has the same attributes as Triple H but his current storyline and his status as a heel makes him a large target for criticism.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I like HHH even though he gets help from his wife sometimes because if he was just given good storylines sometimes he would be a better champion and have better championship reigns. I think he should turn heel because he was the top heel long time ago and it was fun to see him cheating in some weird way. HHH was already at the top before he married Stephanie though he was already like a 4 or 5 time world champion because of DX and stuff. Most people just hate Edge because he's a heel and many fans hate him because he cheats a lot although occasionally his cheating is hilarious like how he got in the elimination chamber at no way out. I know how you feel Edge has been in the wwe for a long time and has practically destroyed his body trying to get to the top with hard work and dedication.|`|R4dXxh6paa	I personally enjoyed seeing Stephanie get the crap RKO'd out of her.|`|XPVF7Ra5aa	Because people are jealous of HHH, plain and simple, HHH and Cena both have made WWE what it is today....Anyone who disgrees are MORONS!!!!!!|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	No one cares? Obviously you're b*tching about it now so I know one person who cares.

I guess WWE is gonna go with Hogan, sadly|`|xNdcvH40aa	id like to see him win MITB|`|XFyIssKjaa	I would like to see both.  How often do you see two classic wrestlers feuding with each other these days.  Plus Jericho needs to fight better wrestlers because he isn't as popular as he once was.|`|84yfLzM9aa	Stone Cold cause Hogan just had back surgery and I think Austin would be more exciting and would draw more money than Hogan since he can carry a better match and he hasn't wrestled since WM XIX
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Definitely the Big Show vs Edge as i'm not a fan of John Cena.He's a limited wrestler with a limited moveset whose matches aren't particularly impressive.At least with Edge and the Big Show, they can work an interesting and entertaining match.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	Big Show vs Edge|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Show VS. Edge VS. Cena<br>  <br>  The only one of these three who I think can actually pull a match is the Rated R Superstar, but Triple Threat matches are always more interesting than singles matches (well, that actually depends).<br>  <br>  I would like Edge to retain, because let's face it, Raw gets one world title back at WrestleMania, and I don't want Triple H to keep the WWE Championship.|`|7NnBhdNEaa	Big show vs edge vs john cena|`|R4dXxh6paa	Show vs. Edge|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Big Show vs. Edge.<br>  Cena's like a 3rd wheel.|`|SJZDv8v2aa	the triple threat would be quite intresting, its better than just 2 guys who you know wont bring much of a crowd attention,  fighting it out in a mediocre match.<br>  Now im no cena fan but EVERYONE knows that when cena is in a match people are gonna think 'wow what a great match this is gonna be!' cena is now a household name and he may not be able to wrestle but the crowd loves him. adding him to the match would be a good move to raise the ratings.<br>  Hogan vs Cena.... for F*ck sake! 2 guys who's finishers do no damage what so bloody ever! oh no hogans hulking up! wtf how does that help in a match... firstly he gets his *** kicked and outta no where he hulks up and his opponent practically starts crying.<br>  then theres cena the '21st century' hogan. the match would be intresting but neither one of these men can wrestle in my opinion.<br>  idc what you guys think of my opinion its mine and im stickin to it!<br>  HES HULKIN UP!!!!!!!!!!!! grrrrr! lmfao|`|7ImGw976aa	Just Big Show and Edge, getting so bored of seeing Cena having championship matches at good chunk of main events like Wrestlemania and very often has got to win everything he's in.

Here is some tips to help you to avoid it in the future. <br>  <br>  1) Eat 2 hours prior to running to give you energy and allow you to digest your food so you wont have a cramp<br>  <br>  2) If you DO have a cramp, lift your arm and try to stretch it out. Ex. If your cramp is on the left side, lift up your left arm and stretch to your right side.|`|79b2yM3saa	Calm down ur breathing and fix your pace cuz thats usually the thing that gets u the cramps- don't stop!!|`|WaWZYxmzaa	Given I don't know the specifics of your side pain makes suggestions for help a little more broad....are you a sprinter or middle distance and up?If you are a sprinter it's more likely to be a bio-mechanical problem rather than "Reflux" caused by the build up of "Lactate" (waste products from anaeobic exercise)in your blood that happens in middle and distance runners.Both sprinters and distance runners would benefit from "Core Strength" exercises,just "Google" it and you will get explanations and demo's on how to achieve core strength.These exercises help balance up any bio-mechanical imbalances that have developed and reduce the chance of injury or limitation of exercise (running)....If you are a distance runner and racing frequently(at least once a week)your body develops an improved ability to handle the build up of lactate,so this would be unlikely to be the problem, making it more likely you would benefit from "Core Exercises"If you are not racing frequently,do some race pace "time trials" at around 2/3 -3/4 race distance ie:600m if you are an 800m runner,1000m if your are a 1500m runner once a week.|`|MDmpNumVaa	stretch thouroughly before and after running. I find that i don't get cramps in my stomach and muscles if i do this. Also eating healthy is good and eat veggies and fruits after your workout is good.

r5AMG8g7aa	I see this type of question all the time. No you are not to old to start. I started when I was 13. I have had students that did not start until they were in their 40's and 50's. I think that starting at 7 or 8 might be to young. It definitely is for some people. When I started training in the 1960's there were almost no children studying martial arts. It was a rough thing that mostly adults practiced. Good Luck!<br>   |`|FMEHpZZFaa	No you are not too old to start. You can never be too old to start. There are several people in their late 60's who have recently started at the gym I attend. They are gaining strength and flexibility that will help them to live longer and fruitful lives.<br>  |`|N5SVU6Xwaa	lol not at all your never to old and let me tell you watch out for gyms they say there good and good self defense but alot are terrible and if you want true self defense do krav maga and if theres no school in ur area do muay thai or mma|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I think you can start at any age! It is a great hobby and exercise too!!!|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	your never to old.14 is a good age to start.|`|fPZrqmoPaa	I didn't stay with it, but I started when I was 22. Being 14 you will probably pick up on things faster.  I was also in a class with people ranging from 8 years old to 45.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	my oldest student started at 65 yrs old. if your younger then her you should be good too go. <br>  if your older then her your also good to go.<br>  there is no maximum age. as long as you feel young enough you can do martial arts. even if you don't feel young enough you can.
EmDBjD5Oaa	Not according to Vince McMahon whos made more money off of Cena then any other superstar lately.  But thats besides the point.....RKO RKO RKO|`|FYwc4pC1aa	yes|`|AA10065077	According to Vince McMahon, John Cena is the next Hulk Hogan. I can't say that John Cena is over rated, he can sell, he knows how to use the mic, and he can wrestler. Not a lot of people in the WWE can do everything well. The WWe will keep pushing him because that's best for the company.|`|0AnsztdOaa	Its impossible to underrate or overrate someone in this kind of wrestling because it is fake. If the producers wanted Cena to win every match for the next year, he would. And yes, if they are bringing him back, its so he will re gain popularity, thus earning the producers more money from Cena merchandise.|`|E4ov12Voaa	Keep in mind that there's a lot of fans out there that do like Cena. They're the ones that pay money to see him and buy his merchandise.<br>  <br>  WWE knows this, and they know that they're going to have to keep pushing him because that's what's best for the company.
gbkCpn21aa	PLEASE don't get these skates. I pity the poor beginners at my ice arena that are tricked into buying these skates. The boot is the floppiest you can find and the blades are very low quality. I wouldn't recommend getting these skates at all. Instead see if there is a Pro Shop or an authorized skate dealer at your local ice arena or check into if anyone is selling used skates. You can find skates for these prices that are way better quality. Riedell and Jackson brand skates are usually the best for beginners, although riedell is a bit pricier but still good quality.|`|LdZQGpsnaa	I think the first ones will be better if you plan on starting some figure skating jumps because it looks like they have a slightly better pick.  I've noticed that some young skaters who don't have a good toe-pick on their first pair of recreational skates have trouble doing some skills.<br>  Of course if you want to be absolutely sure of what skates are best for you. I recommend going to a sporting goods store and trying them on for yourself.<br>  In any case, the pair of skates that feel the best for you length and width wise as well as offering the most comfort would be the ideal choice.<br>  <br>  And one more thing. If you want to start figure skating and maybe doing some competitions then you should get competitive figure skates like Riedells. They offer way more support and are ideal for doing skating elements (even if you are not planning on competing). But if you are just starting out then stick with the recreational skates because competitive ones cost a lot and rec skates would be alright for you for now. <br>  <br>  Unless, you are ok with buying used competitive skates, which would still give you everything you need but not be as expensive. To find some competitive skates look for a store or figure skating specialty store in your town that sells them.<br>  (in my opinion this is the best option)|`|mjidg1nwaa	You could buy these skates but honestly they would be a waste of money. They have almost no support and the blades are crap. They would not get you very far in skating at all.<br>  <br>  You need something that has some quality and support to it. I bought these skates when I first started <a href="http://www.riedellskates.com/ice/117.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.riedellskates.com/ice/117.htm...</a> and while it is time for me to upgrade, I still have them and they still work well. I am in Beta-Gamma. For you I wouldn't suggest anything lower then these because anything lower wouldn't last you.<br>  <br>  However, if you are just a recreational skater then the skates from Dick's or Riedell white ribbons could work, but I would still suggest the Riedell red ribbons.|`|f8a0b4386fd9d0bffed6f6b99d8f4239aa	For recreational yea. but if your gonna take lessens no.<br>  <br>  Jackson artiste is what i would recommend, will last till you get your lutz. their about $100 though...<br>  <a href="http://www.jacksonskates.com/html/frames/frameset-prod.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jacksonskates.com/html/frames...</a><br>  |`|IsQckOXraa	These are good skates for Begginners (stressed!) they are a good soft boot, but not excellent.  Go with these boots until you start learning 3-turns, that is when you will need real support.  Don't buy an expensive boot now until then (i suggest ridell or jackson), you should try to be committed to the sport until you buy a $100 plus boot. <br>  Go with the 1st pair, they look like they have the best support.  <br>  Make sure you get them sharpened before you go and take your lesson.  And remember when u r done wipe the blade and bottom off w/ a hand towel.  <br>  Make sure to get a soft blade guard. <br>  Hope i helped! :)
LdZQGpsnaa	At the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships Kimmie Meissner placed ahead of Yu-na Kim in the free program <a href="http://www.isufs.org/results/wc2007/SEG004.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.isufs.org/results/wc2007/SEG0...</a><br>  but overall Yu-na Kim placed third <a href="http://www.isufs.org/results/wc2007/CAT002RS.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.isufs.org/results/wc2007/CAT0...</a> <br>  ...with two other Asian figure skaters.<br>  and yes they do tend to win a lot :)|`|8i2b0TnIaa	White girls are no competition for the Koreans, Chinese and the Japanese.. When these 3 nationalities are devoted to something they will do it to the maximum.They have a lot of confidence which is really great!!.. White girls tend to get nervous, they aren't as confident..     Yu-Na Kim is the best no matter what!!!;)|`|f8a0b4386fd9d0bffed6f6b99d8f4239aa	im not sure<br>  Yu - Na Kim ( or Kim Yu - Na ) is ranked number one in the world followed by Mao asada.<br>  no "white" skaters follow untill like 11th or something like that.
RGDF4Gwbaa	No!!! Do not go surf with new tattoos, the tattoo needs to scab up to start what is called the healing process. If you wear a shirt it will rub and the water keeps it soft, bad combination. Wait about a week and a half to two weeks. I've been surfin 25 yrs. and covered with tattoos, all in good condition. A week and a half is a small amount of time to wait compared to the results of an ink drawn tattoo that didn't get to heal properly in the beginning. It's worth the wait, SEE YA IN THE WATER......  |`|Hvuqv6duaa	I wouldn't recommend it because the sun could harm it and all the water isn't good for it either.|`|azIA2rmRaa	Yes, it is fine. I have a back tatoo that reads, "VENGEANCE 7." Then I went swimming.|`|lVxhiMopaa	I'm not sure, probably not..<br>  if you get sunburnt wouldnt<br>  that screw the tattoo up, I wouldnt<br>  worry so much about the water actually messing<br>  it up though.|`|YiHRHca9aa	No you aren't supposed to get it soaked in water, so surfing and swimming are out, for at least 2 weeks or so, it depends on the tattoo
AA11541333	it depends, if u like hitting u should play saftey. if u dont u would be a pretty good reciever depending on ur speed. i say go for saftey though. u sound like u got a pretty good build for it|`|KTp27Fokaa	I say a corner as long as you are around 6 feet and/or can jump|`|gJzSlKwGaa	how about your height and leg strength. maybe some of your skills, can you catch, do you run well, how's your arm, can you kick, do you block well too, punt? DETAILS I NEED A SCOUTING REPORT!!!|`|0JxX2hRfaa	Our senior linebackers bench 315lbs so far so i would say a safety or corner, but at safety you get to come in and make the big hits|`|bs5Px8U8aa	How's that person's leg? Kicker? Punter? It's guaranteed playing time although not every down.|`|SSJJR9CQaa	im thinking linebacker, safety, or maybe reciever|`|19pNTdFkaa	A TIGHT END, FULL BACK, OR LINEBACKER
Bxe5WgPQaa	well if they get dirty it really doesn't matter because you can throw them in the wash but now if they start to get all scratchy looking they are wearing out so depinning on how good you take care of them and what brand they are they can last 1-7 years|`|AA11541333	it wont matter it they're dirty. cleaning them is easy. gloves will last a lot longer if u dont always pull and stretch them. secure them tightly on ur hands and keep them that way until ur ready to take em off. in a pick up game they should be just fine.

dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Slaton for sure and I guess Betts since he'll probably start with Portis out.|`|6taSSxDVaa	Normally I would say Slaton, as he is going against Indy.  However, Bob Sanders is back and kicking major ***!  I'd go with Sproles.  That's your best bet for any kind of score.  Good Luck!|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Sproles|`|AA11541333	i think Pittman and Slaton. Pittman should be able to run on the Falcon's defense and Slaton is just a great back having a great season
VuIxxJvqaa	When we went to ECW/SD tour in Newcastle, Australia, there was an announcement before the show started encouraging us to take as many pics as we liked of our favourite superstars, but forbidding us to do videos.<br>  <br>  They  didnt mention any styles of camera that were allowed to be used, however, I think you would need a SLR as I had a 10mp digital with a good optical zoom and still found it hard to take good pics.|`|NUehpH4yaa	only real way to take pictures/record video is via cellphone|`|AA10065077	On the back of the Ticketmaster ticket it says camaras, video camaras, and any other recording device is prohibited.
6QrnOBZVaa	Torres is a better player by far. Torres scored and played brilliantly in the final of the Euro's and Ronaldo fizzled in the quarters, semis and final of the championsleague. Torres is a team player and Ronaldo is more interested in his statistics and thats why he takes more shots per game then any other player. His conversion rate of shots to goals scored is actually really ordinary but he wants that fifa player of the year award.....aaaaah dont give it to him.|`|a2ad32848d176ccd23fce84af9334c40aa	Well, for one Fernando Torres is a foreward, Cristiano Ronaldo is a winger and yet Ronaldo Scores more goals than Torres each year.|`|BPpa0DZ5aa	While Torres is amazing, probably the best striker in the world at the moment, he isn't as creative or dynamic as Ronaldo...<br>  <br>  When Ronaldo has the ball he draws multiple defenders which allows his teammates to get open. Ronaldo can get anywhere he wants on the field while Torres is simply a finisher.<br>  <br>  Check out my soccer blog at <a href="http://ilmondodicalcio.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ilmondodicalcio.blogspot.com/</a>|`|HXJXlImnaa	C.Ronaldo is more well rounded a player, with insane foot skills and last years 42 goals are another. Torres is a good player but Ronaldo is just a more dominant player, you can't not notice the lad when he's on the pitch|`|fBQCKMWLaa	i would take torres on my team over ronaldo any day. more committed player.

51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Forget it.  Spin kicks beyond 360 are useless in anything but XMA type demonstrations.  That kick takes 1.5-2.0 seconds to complete not counting the time you spend setting up for it.  By the time you got the the point you were actually going to kick any decent opponent would have you on the ground.  |`|FMEHpZZFaa	Your best bet is to go to a McDojo that concentrates on tournaments.

LGVrhTFTaa	Depending on your draft position,in no particular order,my strategy is to grab a 2nd,3rd,and 1st baseman,a shortstop,and a stud to anchor my outfield in the 1st 5 rounds.It doesn't always work out that way because taking the best hitter supercedes that strategy.<br>  Like my last draft I got my SS,2nd baseman,and outfielder in the 1st 3 rounds,then the guy I wanted (Mourneau) was taken right before my pick,so I took C.Granderson in the 4th round,then Chris Davis in the 5th..The main thing is building a dependable/dominating offencive  core of players in the 1st 5,or 6 rounds.Then take LOTS of pitchers+closers<br>  in the 3-4 following rounds,then take 1,or 2 more offencive players (Like J.Bruce,or Joey Votto.),take more pitchers/closers,then take a catcher like B.Molina,or C.Iannetta,more pitchers/closers,then I'd complete your offence with players like Willy Taveras,or Delmon Young,and finally take more pitchers/closers.<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|92e74b5c9571c9dcdd15573e4a3ba0b4aa	It's common advice in fantasy baseball. but advice you should always follow. For the first 4-5 rounds, just draft the best player available in your mind. Don't worry about filling out each position right away or you won't have a team that poses a threat. For example, let's say by Round 5 you have a 1B, 2B, 3B, and an OF. Are you really going to reach for a Jhonny Peralta or Derek Jeter who should probably go a round or 2 later? Or say by Round 8 you have a 1B, 2B, SS, 3B, 2 OF and 1 SP, should you reach for a mediocre catcher or relief pitcher? The answer is no.<br>  <br>  But in general to answer your question, I personally like to have a strong infield because OF and pitching are incredibly deep and you can find good talent and sleepers late in the draft or you can find guys who are 1-category helpers like .AVG or SB that you'll need to start every day (i.e. Willy Taveras for SB or Milton Bradley for .AVG) so you need to have openings for them.<br>  <br>  I'll give you my scenario, I am drafting 3rd overall in my money league in a couple days. Assuming Hanley and Pujols go first (knowing the guys in my league, they will), I'll probably take David Wright because he helps everywhere and 3B is relatively weak this year. Coming back to me in the second round, I'll probably look for a Prince Fielder or Dustin Pedroia to fill the 1B/2B hole. After taking 2 strong infielders, I will probably look for my stud OF that every team needs (at least 1), probably a Carlos Lee or Nick Markakis type. After a long string of picks, in round 4 I will probably target my first starter (Cole Hamels, Jake Peavy, Brandon Webb, etc). Then round 5 I'll probably aim for a 1B or 2B (whichever position I didn't get in round 2), and that'll probably be an Adrian Gonzalez or Brian Roberts type. That gives me 3 strong infielders, a good OF, and a good starter to begin my draft. And that's very solid in my books.<br>  <br>  However, you can't head into the draft with your strategy set in stone. Things will change and players will drop and there will be players you feel you need to reach for (but don't be ridiculous in your reaching). Let's say I follow my strategy above, but when my round 2 pick comes I see that Tim Lincecum or Johan Santana or Matt Holliday or Carlos Beltran is still on the board, I'll be happy to abandon my strategy and take these players for good value.<br>  <br>  You have to improvise my friend, there really is no most important position to draft first. However, the thinnest positions depth wise this year are SS, 3B, and C (as always, but target them late in the draft) so if you're looking for who to get early, try and get the studs from these positions|`|0kEc1aJgaa	i always take the best player available but generally i try to fill positions like this<br>  <br>  2B/SS first few rounds<br>  3B<br>  1B/OF<br>  SP/C<br>  RP

He gets to the basket extremely well, he's an efficient passer, an exceptional scorer and plays defense well when he wants to.  <br>  <br>  But...<br>  <br>  Wade has skills as well.  He is an exceptional scorer, he has increased his defensive prowess so that he now not only steals, his blocked shots total has increased.  Also his ability to get to the basket is on a par with Kobe.  Both get there better than LeBron (without his strength to back them up) but Kobe couldn't carry his team when it lacked All Stars or good players while Wade has nearly carried his team to the playoffs already...doing EVERYTHING in every category for his team.  <br>  <br>  I think Kobe is very good...but I have to say, as an all around player...<br>  Wade has him edged out.|`|ks54akugaa	It seems like to me you have NO LIFE. How much of a loser are you to focus your energy on bringing out all the bad stats for a player.<br>  As for the OLYMPIC game, USA would not have had a GOLD MEDAL if it wasn't for KOBE. What happened in the 2004 Olympics, They had D-Wade and LeBron but no GOLD.<br>  2008, Yeah D-Wade was leading in scoring but if you watch the Gold medal game closely KOBE took over in the final 8-9 minutes of the game. The plays went through him. As far as bad games everyone has those, Michael Jordan was great, but at times he also had bad games.<br>  NO ONE HAS A PERFECT SEASON, THERES ALWAYS GONNA BE BAD GAMES.|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Dwyane Wade!!!!!!!! I mean the only guy that i've seen play with so much passion with not as good team...Is Allen Iverson.<br>  <br>  Kobe has he's players, and he's not as a good leader as Dwyane Wade. When things got tough with the Lakers he just blamed it on his teamates. And he wanted to leave the Lakers.<br>  <br>  This year, when Dwyane Wade is held back by his team, ex. 50pt game against Orlando, it was clearly His team fault the they didn't win the game. They missed open lay-ups, open shots ect.<br>  And much more games, he just took the Heat in the interviews, he only says, "we have to do a better job next games", he's not like Kobe that starts tripping everytime he has a good game a still looses!!! And that's what a leader should do, take the hit for their team.<br>  <br>  But I think he's tie with LeBron James, I mean this 2 guys are impressive.<br>  <br>  NBA BEST PLAYERS<br>  WADE<br>  LEBRON<br>  KOBE<br>  CHRIS PAUL<br>  DWIGHT HOWARD.|`|BUFbXDDvaa	Kobe is better but i like Wade

oYtUZCG0aa	alot of protein is GREAT <br>  EXCESS protein= excess calories= fat storage.<br>  so it depends on how much you supplement with my friend. try to get one gram of protein for every pound you weigh. and also if you are gonna supplement with protein powders get WHEY and half a serving within 30 mins of a workout and a whole serving as immediate as possible after your session. :)|`|L3byzh3Gaa	they contain large amounts of bull sperm.|`|HFGjaRYjaa	What does this have to do with football|`|wwRbkCMraa	Yes, whey protein can be a huge advantage, but if you are overeating and taking in way too many calories then yes you can get fat... doesn't matter whether you are eating too much whey protein or too much bread.... if you are taking in too many calories you will add body fat.<br>  <br>  Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.|`|mUSs0lyaaa	i take that alot. its safe, it will only make u fat if u drink it and dont work out. u take it asap after u work out. its not like steroids were u grow muscles without even doing anything. creatin is the best legal protein shake u can take. but it can give u kidney/liver problems when u get old. whey protein is ur best bet if u want to stay healthy and not break the law.|`|8x77sUjAaa	drink them within 30 minutes of your workout and you'll be good
cKDralDHaa	I don't think so. The WWE doesn't recognize TNA, ROH or any of the other promotions out on the market. What made the Invasion Angle so good in my opinion is that everyone knew who WCW and ECW was, they knew that all 3 companies had their own little ratings war with the WWE. The Monday Night Wars paved the way for this feud because Vince acknowledged the threat WCW posed to his own company. But he hasn't batted an eyelash over TNA's precense. <br>  <br>   I agree that the Invasion was the best storyline the WWF ever had. It beats out every other storyline they've put out because it was so large and expansive. It gave the established superstars the spots they deserved. But at the same time it gave the younger superstars some of the spotlight. People who didn't appear too regularly in the main event like Hurricane Helms, or Tajiri, X-Pac, Billy Kidman all of those guys. Plus with the build up and the promos it actually felt like an on-camera War between the two companies. ECW and WCW guys pulling behind the scenes attacks, the WWF pounding them out in the audience. The entire angle was just gold, except Stone Cold turning, I didn't quite get that part too well. <br>  <br>   It was great for the fans because you got to see the big names from all 3 companies collide with one another in matches that people had just dreamed of/wished for. <br>  <br>  The Undertaker<br>  Kane<br>  The Rock<br>  Chris Jericho <br>  The Big Show <br>  <br>  vs<br>  <br>  Booker T <br>  Rob Van Dam<br>  Kurt Angle (didn't quite get that) <br>  Stone Cold (didn't quite get that either) <br>  Shane Mchmahon (weird) <br>  <br>   Okay so the final Survivor Series showdown wasn't the greatest example of that. But by far the Invasion Angle just destroys everything the WWE has done in the last 9 years. I don't think they'll do anything like it again unless TNA establishes themselves a bit more, but I sure hope they do because there's alot of good matches that could come out of a WWE vs TNA feud.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	no duh it was the best. It involved the whole company, and WCW was invading. What other storyline could possibly be better than that<br>  <br>  And no, I don't think there will be another storyline like this. TNA is nowhere near the level of competition that WCW was|`|3rgBJuu9aa	Yes i do think the invasion was the best storyline in the wwe<br>  <br>  for those fans (John cena fans) that dont know what the invasion was<br>  <br>  Before the event officially began, Chavo Guerrero, Jr. (WCW) defeated Scotty 2 Hotty (WWF) in a match taped for Sunday Night HEAT.[14] The first match of the event was between Lance Storm and Mike Awesome (ECW), and Edge and Christian (WWF). The match went back and forth until Awesome attempted a cheap shot at Edge from the apron. Edge avoided it, performed a dropkick, and sent Storm on top of him with a back body drop. Christian then leaped off Edge over the top rope onto Storm and Awesome. As Christian was on the top turnbuckle, Awesome tripped Christian, and attacked his back outside. Back in the ring, Storm and Awesome dominated Christian after Storm threw Christian's gut into the ringpost. Christian fought back with a crossbody, but Awesome tagged in, and performed a flapjack spinebuster. Storm and Awesome dominated Christian until Christian performed a back body drop to Awesome from the top rope. Edge and Storm tagged in, and Edge performed an Edge-O-Matic to Storm. Storm performed a jawbreaker, and attempted a double belly to back suplex with Awesome. Edge landed on his feet, and Christian performed a flying clothesline to both Storm and Awesome. Edge performed a spear to Awesome. Storm attempted a superkick to Christian, but Edge shoved Christian, and took the kick himself. As Awesome held Edge in a crucifix, Christian performed a spear to Awesome. Edge landed on top of Awesome, and pinned him for the victory.[3][4]<br>  <br>  The second match was between WCW Senior Referee Nick Patrick and WWF Senior Referee Earl Hebner with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Other WCW and WWF referees accompanied them to the ring. The match started with Hebner delivering kicks in the corner, followed by punches, and knee drops to the midsection, but Patrick pulled Hebner outside. Back in the ring, Patrick stomped Hebner, but Hebner fought back with punches, and mounted punches. Patrick fought back by performed a low blow, and sent Hebner outside with a baseball slide. WCW referees stomped Hebner until Foley stopped them, and ejected them from ringside. Back in the ring, Patrick complained to Foley, allowing Hebner to perform a flying shoulder block, and pin Patrick for the victory. After the match, Patrick argued with Foley. Foley punched him, and applied the mandible claw.[3][4]<br>  <br>  The third match was between the APA (Faarooq and Bradshaw) (WWF), and Sean O'Haire and Chuck Palumbo (WCW). The teams were the tag team champions of their promotions. The match began with the APA performing a double spinebuster to Palumbo. Bradshaw had the advantage over Palumbo, then O'Haire. After Faarooq tagged in, O'Haire countered a belly to back suplex attempt, and performed a knee lift. Palumbo tagged in, and Faarooq performed a flying shoulder block. Bradshaw then tagged in, and performed a fallaway slam to Palumbo. O'Haire then kicked Bradshaw in the head, and performed a Widow Maker. Palumbo tagged in, and Bradshaw fought back with a DDT. After Faarooq tagged in, O'Haire pulled him out of the ring, and sent him into the ringsteps. They dominated Faarooq until Faarooq fought back with a spinebuster. Bradshaw and Palumbo tagged in, and Bradshaw performed a big boot, and a powerslam. As Bradshaw attempted a fallaway slam, O'Haire performed a superkick, and dropped Bradshaw onto the top turnbuckle. After Faarooq sent O'Haire outside, Palumbo performed a superkick to Faarooq, and Bradshaw pinned Palumbo after performing a Clothesline from Hell.[3][4]<br>  <br>  The fourth match was between the WWF Light Heavyweight Champion X-Pac and the WCW Cruiserweight Champion Billy Kidman. The match started back and forth until Kidman performed a hurricanrana, and an enzuigiri. X-Pac fought back after sending Kidman over the top rope, and performed a springboard reverse crossbody to the outside. Back in the ring, X-Pac applied the sleeper hold. Kidman escaped, and applied the sleeper hold, but X-Pac countered with a belly to back suplex. X-Pac went to the top rope, and performed a somersault legdrop, but Kidman avoided it. Kidman performed a B.K. Bomb, and mounted punches, which X-Pac countered with a powerbomb. X-Pac attempted another powerbomb, but Kidman reversed it into a sitout facebuster. X-Pac then countered an aerial attack with an X-Factor. As he attempted a Bronco buster, Kidman lifted his leg, performing a low blow. Kidman then pinned X-Pac after a shooting star press.[3][4]<br>  <br>  The fifth match was between Raven (ECW) and William Regal (WWF). Regal gained the early advantage following a double underhook suplex, and a catapult, sending Raven outside. Back in the ring, Raven tossed Regal over top rope, and performed a baseball slide, and a Russian legsweep into the security wall. Back in the ring, Raven performed a diving punch to Regal's forehead. Regal countered another attempt, and performed a knee lift.

Now and days the story lines get more boring and not really interesting. Some are ok, but i agree that it went downhill after that.
