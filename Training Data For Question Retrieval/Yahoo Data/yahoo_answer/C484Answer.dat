067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	Get a good diet, eat right. If you think its unhealthy..it probably is.  Whole gains, fruits, veggies and lean meats including tuna, salmon, turkey and chicken.    your also going to have to exercise a little. I would suggest running 2 miles in the morning and maybe weights in the after noon.    Consume about 600 less calories than you burn a day.   It may seem like alot to do, alot of bear. and it might, but hes not having the time of his life either. If hes training so can you!|`|i7XkKqhgaa	use a shake program such as celebrity slim. i used it and lost 5kg in 4 weeks. google celebrityslim.com its a healthy eating program. wont leave you hungry|`|00304d9ffa531ceed89bafb4bfe8b6f0aa	First of all you don't need to buy anything or order anything to lose weight. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. This way, your body starts to increase its metabolism so that calories are burned faster. Also, mini-meals can prevent overeating.  Choose foods that you like. Learn to prepare healthful, low-calorie foods that taste good by checking healthy cook books for new recipes. Eating well doesn't have to mean eating dull. Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas. Eat food that are lean like fish and chicken breast. Rule of thumb if its processed then don't eat it. That means try to only eat foods that are in there natural form such as raw fruits and veggies. If you can clean up your nutrition and stick with it for ever plus do low intensity cardio keeping your heart rate around 120-140 for 30 mins a day you will lose that weight so fast. Just remember this is a life style change you will need to do for the rest of your life because the second you go back to your old habits the second you start to gain fat again. Pure and simple.
bgtNYOp5aa	Yeah I hear you, I had braces 3 times since I was 7 years old till about 20 and still have a retainer on.     I have great teeth, and glad I got braces.

kj507W26aa	Honey, you didnt nap. A nap is 20 to 30 minutes. A Cat Nap is 10 - 20 minutes This type of napping makes you feel energized, but when you nap (sleep) for 2 hrs. it throws off your night sleep and sometimes depending on the time your napped, you will feel more tired, goggy and just feeling lost and awful!     .............   And NO,  it doesnt count against your 8 hr. sleep.     If you are sick in bed, sleep is the best medicine.|`|buMDPzdAaa	i dont think it counts. but it does throw you off and make you feel more tired. sometimes its better to just take a 10-20 minute nap

j0yv0T0oaa	Yes.  You are onto something.  Let me share my story of situational depression, it validates your theory that negative emotions rob us of the ability to allow ourselves to be loved and to give love:    I could not believe that the man of my dreams loved me.  I heard him say it, but I just couldn't accept or believe it.  Even though he published a soul-bearing ad in our college newspaper professing his undying love, wish and intent to marry me and take me away from my abusive bum boyfriend......I didn't believe it.    You see my life went on a downward spiral for a while and to cope I went into denial.  I trudged through my life of sh*t feeling like I had a cement block around my neck.  I also felt worthless bc I gained 50 pounds during my pregnancy....so I was fat, lived in poverty (thanks to my boyfriend's unwillingness to pull his weight), was emotionally, economically and sometimes physically abused, and was caring for an infant while working and taking classes.    Well, the man of my dreams stuck by me, hoping and praying that I would come to my senses and realize that my bf is killing me.    He patiently and lovingly waited for the right opportunity to breathe new life into me.  I feel like myself again-myself only stronger.    His love pulled me out of denial and depression.  Feeling his love for me is what pulled me out of these murky waters.  He encouraged me to open my eyes and he led me away from darkness.  I will love him forever.     I wish you the best of luck in helping your friend with her depression.  Besides good professional help, clean living, and a healthy lifestyle will help regulate bodily chemicals.  I think Omega 3 fatty acids are great for nourishing the nervous system in our brains.  A daily supplement could help ease some of the pain of your friend's depression.    Blessings.|`|CHie5Zsraa	From personal experience I think that some people love someone so much that when they are that depressed they attack and try to hurt the person they love.  Its a way of protecting their loved one.    Basically, she might think he deserves better.  She could also be pushing him away because of fear that she is not worthy.

So while your at school yell a lot, go to the football/soccer/basketball/baseball games and cheer for your team and scream a lot.

Excessive coughing, smoking or alcohol consumption    I guess you ruled out  2 so you need to infect yourself or start coughing, smoking or drinking.  Good luck with that!|`|24biipOpaa	the only way you can do it is by yelling a lot and screaming for a long period of time. or get yourself really really sick. i would wait till you go to a concert or sports game and while you're there yell the entire time then you should lose it|`|o0QVfQJgaa	you could talk a lot to yourself. lol|`|c8m3gY8Aaa	wel you might want to try later because sleeping will make it better|`|nGkCWpRVaa	your mad you may loose it for ever|`|v6LNWfx8aa	scream silently but i wouldn't recomend loosing your voice  .........................................

When I first started taking mine I didn't ever get a period (I wasn't pregnant!).  Your body is most likely adjusting still.  Give it some time, if it continues you should contact your doctor just to be sure.

Another im a college wrestler (wrestling being one of the greatest anabolic sports) and i have perfect endurance even in aerobic exercise. Both my parents smoked when i was living with them. If your lungs are weak, run more. If your positive that your just not out of shape, you might have an acute case of asthma.     Run, run, and run some more, that's whats ultimately going to make the difference, and if you don't good, don't blame it on the smoking...

vW7szpvNaa	Ok, I know I should mind my own business on this.  But  ;-P    You NEED to stop obsessing with your weight.  You're young, smart maybe not on this issue, but hey you at least were smart enough to do the research into the calories and all, but binging & purging???  WTF.  Seriously you are doing so much long term, non repairable damage to your body, no good is going to come from that at all. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you will probably at sometime want children?  Well, news flash, you're gonna gain weight, gaining weight is natural.  Losing weight is natural.  It's great that you care about yourself, but do it for health reasons not image ones.  There is no such thing as perfect, it simply doesn't exist in anything in the world or life, so stop trying to achieve that which doesn't exist.     You need to start hanging out with people that boost your self esteem, not ones that make you feel as though you're not good enough.  I saw this cause I added you as a contact a while back in P&S, and that's normally where I chill, cause normally I'm a jokester, but this is definitely no joke.  You are better then this and you really know it, you're just not looking at it the right way.|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	I suggest you consider what people eat when getting ready for a body building contest. Its not the calories as much as it is the simple carbs. You can eat more, and still lose. You can learn a bit about eating good carbs at www.atkins.com its a free site.

If you don't eat enough, you're metabolism will slow down and it you will stop losing weight, or lose it much much slower. And if you start binging, you could potentially gain. So go up to 1,500-1,600, but keep working out. You probably shouldn't lose too much more weight, it sounds like you're already quite lean.    xoxo  Simona|`|QIlhmWwBaa	you should not count callories   you should just eat healty and thats about it  why do you want to have a perfect body?   that sounds pretty perfect to me|`|bsMwySYJaa	geez you have the perfect body lucky!!!!  i wish i was exactly your weight cuz i am 131 and your height !   but burning all those calories you need to eat 2800 cals just to mantain cuz the average person burns 2000 cals just doing normal daily stuff???    xx|`|C0Dj76OMaa	there is no perfect body.  whats wrong with 120?   thats thin, are you calling me fat? lol  im 5'4 and that weight, and i love my body! im curvy.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	You shouldn't really try to stick to counting calories, just eating right and eating healthy is good.

067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	Steam room and sauna have the same affects.   I would go after, just make sure after your workout your get your protein and dextrose for proper recovery.  Nutrition comes first! then you can worry about hitting up the sauna.     If you have problems eating/drinking your protein and being in a hot setting then avoid the sauna!    The sauna will relax your muscles, and help recovery.   Just remember nothing beats recovery from a hard workout than a proper post workout meal, and a good nights sleep.|`|VsqL1Ftkaa	This isn't a simple question.  If you plan on doing only weight training, go into the steam room BEFORE working out.  This heats your muscles (preventing injury), and raises your heart rate so you can be more productive.  If you are doing mostly cardio you want to STRETCH BEFORE and go into the steam room AFTER you finish to maintain your heart rate and relax the muscles with heat.  If you don't use the steam room, then stretch AFTER as well.    As for the sauna... it draws oils out, the steam room draws water out.  If you go into a sauna, and you are wet, you will soon become dry and - after a bit - see your skin begin to glisten.  I usually drape a wet towell over my head in the sauna because it hurts my sinus cavity.  Usually the sauna is good if you swim.|`|SiomJ10Saa	I always liked going after wards, idk to me if felt nice because it did relax you after working out .. it got everything out of your pours too which is nice.    Then I would just shower off after that (you will want to shower after being in a steam room for sure!)
Yu7y6yfraa	No, I do not want you to die.  You are not a useless person.  You just cannot see that right now.      I am sure that are quite a few things that you are excellent at; it is only going to take time for you to find these things.  Actually, I bet they find you before you think about them.  That is what has always happened to me.    I am 52 and when I was younger, my life seemed pretty depressing.  I always thought everyone was smarter, more talented and had more to offer to the world than me.  I was probably close to 30 years old before I realized how wrong I was.      Did you ever see the movie, It's a Wonderful Life, with Jimmy Stuart?  If not, I suggest you watch it.    I have another suggestion.  Each day, do what you have to do, but make it a point to do something nice for someone else.  It can be as small as a smile.  You see, by doing things for others, you allow yourself to feel like your life is worthwhile.    Make it a point to make sure your life has purpose and makes the world a better place.  You do not have to have any great skills to do this.    I would suggest volunteer work, but it sounds like you do not have time for that.      Anyway, I think if you follow some of these ideas and keep working your way through life, you may start viewing the value of your life a bit differently.  A life is very valuable.  Sometimes you just have to look at it from a different perspective.    I hope you start feeling better.  You can contact me if you wish.

A simply dietary change will change your life.No one is inheritedly useless.We all have a purpose we are or arent aware of.

Flax is the best source of ALA omega 3 fatty acid which our body converts to more important fatty acids called DHA and EPA.For the efficient conversion to take place,foods containing a large amount of the following nutrients must be consumed along with the flaxseed:C,B3,B6 [vitamins],zink and Magnesium [minerals].I recommend 3 table spoons of flax with 100 grams[or more if to your liking] of almonds and/or 250g of green peas,1 kiwi every day.[do not take more then 3 table spoons of flax because large amounts can cause intestinal gases which can cause abdominal pain and/or constipation.If three spoons causes abdominal discomfort lower the dosage to 2 table spoons of grinded flax and elevate it to 3 table spoons after your body adapts to high fiber content].

ZCCb38ikaa	It's actually been shown where some men CAN produce breast milk. Sometimes the pituitary gland will send signals in men (that is usually just send towomen) to tell the body to produce the milk.  It's very rare from what I have heard.    Could it have been a pimple? If not, you could be one of the rare cases. Of course, it could never happen again, or it could.|`|wMkNpL6zaa	lol it is pretty funny probably an infection from saltwater or maybe a pimple|`|y9nx4jt6aa	yes, it is actually possible for guys to lactate but not with the same magnitude girls can|`|gJzSlKwGaa	geez i hope not|`|xX9D292Laa	Hell yeah we can nothing better then fresh breast milk and oreos.

pWl7SHjTaa	Try tiger balm or bengay... if it is persistent and you type a lot or just use your hands a lot, I would go see the doctor, especially if they start cramping, because it could be carpal tunnel, and it only gets worse the more you use your hands. Try every once in a while to stop typing or writing for 10-15 minutes and strech your fingers and hands and let them rest. there are also the voice programs that type what you say. also if you are in class, ask your professor if they would mind letting you record them with a recorder (like a little digital one). Some are up for it, some will say no. This will help out your hands by not having to have them go crazy trying to get everything down and you can review it and transcribe it later. Hope this helps|`|DUuf81tKaa	Maybe you should make a visit to a doctor, you could have carpal tunnel syndrome. Your symptoms are similar to the symptoms of carpal tunnel.   For more information, please check out:   http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/carpa...|`|Ogh2zd7eaa	doctor|`|iCKkOWI7aa	arthritis or too long on the computer?|`|a499884662fa57a7be95d9e42c7ff638aa	Get those voice recognition word processing programs|`|SpYS7VYoaa	It could be that your muscles are stressed or you pulled something. But Altot fo typists get carpall-tunnesyndromeom from typing all the time, which is quite common but painful.  If the pain in only in your wrists, its prob not a big deal and is prob caused from typing, but go to your doctor to get it checked out.  I personally had a bone issue that took 13 doctors to figure out what it was, I was under 18 at the time so it was a pediactric rhumetologist, but a regular rhumetologist might be your best bet to get this treated since that was one of the things she checked me for.
xMbmDJIhaa	Immunizations are only needed to be taken again if the virus has mutated into a new strain, for example flu shots are made every year because the flu mutates very often and so for the old immunization doesn't make your body create the antibodies to attack the new strain.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Some are lifetime. Some take a series to achieve continue longevity and some do have an update. So as adults, you are fine with the ones you were given that are life long, interesting subject, and there are so many news ones since I had mine as a child. Find your shot record and see whats it got and then find an online health site to show you how things are going these days on suggested renewals.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	No because you are immunised with a lesser form of the disease as a child and therefor make antibodies to ward off any attack from the little blighters.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	not really.  just your tetanus shot, which you need to renew every 10 years.|`|Vrc13ExVaa	Chill out, you're being sort of paranoid.    After your body is given either a) the antibodies to fight a disease or b) a small amount of a disease that your body creates antibodies to fight off (a.k.a. immunizations/vaccinations), your Memory T-Cells (a type of cell in the immune system) keep some of the antibodies or memories of the antibodies to fight the disease if it comes around again.    Some wear off, depending on the type of vaccination. Some need to be renewed every 3 or 5 or more years. Some don't. Some require child vaccinations and boosters. Some don't always work (like Chicken Pox and the flu one if you get a different strain).     You're probably covered for measles and whooping cough, but if you need to do some travelling, talk to a doc about what you need to get and what you already have.|`|2QFe7onpaa	Immunizations do wear off, but it is dependent of the certain immunization. Immunizations/vaccinations are basically killed or modified live viruses that we inject into the body to stimulate a reaction in the body. Thus we have an immunity to that virus.    If you are concerned about your immune levels for these diseases, have your titer levels checked at your doctor's office.|`|28r5r6sTaa	Children are immunised at 4 & 5yo with child vaccines. Then again at 12 & 13yo with adult vaccines. Certain immunisations only last for a certain number of years, where you are required to get a booster, like with the tetanus shot its every ten years.
kdSuwt8paa	Worrying  doesn't really solve anything.    And you have your appointment with the doctor.   The feet, knee and buttock could all be coming from a pinched nerve in your back perhaps.   The finger sounds different.   You might just have to wait and see what the doctor says!
llez7aU4aa	I understand completely. And guess what, I'm in my late 20's and getting my PhD and I still don't know what I want to do or what I want. I know I want to be happy, but I just can't get there. The worst part is the relationship stuff. I used to agree that its messed up that people just have a bf or gf just to do it. Now I think you should have one when you are ready. I sure wish I did right now. Too many years of isolation and you wake up and realize you have been missing out.   I am sort of jaded too about the whole work thing. I don't want to spend the next 40 years doing something I don't care about. However, I have seen people do what they want. I have a friend who just up and started drawing (he is a graphic designer but couldn't get work doing it with any company) and putting those pictures on shirts and sells them hisself and couldn't be happier. I know another guy that got his master's in computer science from Standford and just up and quit and started a rafting business and couldn't be happier only working 4 months a year. So it can happen, I just don't know if I'll ever be lucky enough to find that sort of job. I am stuck doing this PhD because I don't know what else to do and don't really care for it. I will probably make it but I just don't care anymore you know?  As for the sex thing I can't help you, but you have to make it fun I guess. Its a normal thing and if you don't have any desire for it then something might be wrong chemically and you should probably see a doctor. It could be sign of depression though.|`|c8m3gY8Aaa	find something you love to do|`|J5E4o0N5aa	soo much reading .......try to get away from ur every day life for a weekend  and think on what you truly want to do in life??|`|7U0sPJ2saa	Change your major (yes, take extra classes).

It may not seem that way now, but the time is coming when you will need to provide an income for yourself and whatever you decide to do, the piece of paper will help.  Also, a degree now is almost like what a high school diploma used to be and is nearly a necessity in a starved job market like we are currently experiencing.  Maybe your Mom is trying to tell you something, like "Once you get out of school, you are on your own, so apply for a job." LOL      I always heard that the most fulfilling career is doing something that you would "do for free".  So, when you decide to start looking for a job, keep in mind that it needs to be something that you enjoy.  We have a friend that quit his law practice to sing.  He is happy, living on his boat in northern Florida and singing when he gets a chance.     Don't worry right now about the relationship/sex thing.  You are young and have time for that when you get the rest of your life figured out.  I was like you, was out of school, working in the communications department of a large oil company, single, doing my thing, when Mr. Right walked in my office door.  He had just been employed as corporate photographer while I was away on assignment.  We had a whirlwind romance and a big church wedding about two months later.  Hon, that was almost 40 happy years ago.      Take one day at a time and you will figure it all out in time.    best wishes..|`|89lEF1bwaa	well i always try to have something to look foward to if im sad.|`|vexuhI3Faa	find something u love...and also passion in life is what u make it|`|dyPFkK4Daa	keep trying new **** until you find something that sparks something.  experimentation is the key.|`|uG8SNldAaa	u must hav a gud no. of frnd circle......diz wil make u relax.....or else hav rreln.ship with god....|`|MHcMY2Pfaa	*Sigh*  Been there done that.  I was a wage slave for 15 years.. in an office and I hated it... HATED IT.    I got fed up so I quit.  I wondered around doing random and strange jobs just to find something I enjoyed.  well now I finally found it..  going to the firefighter academy in 14 days.     if you really hate **** going on in your life this much then change it.  I know it isn't easy, but hey, change never is.  start screwing around and fins something that you have a you enjoy and then stick with it.  No one here is going to be able to give you some piece of magical advice that will change you outlook on life, you have to work at that yourself.  so get to work the sooner you do it the happier you will be.
33e9dcdd714c2c738473e38d4057cc8eaa	Sounds like heart palpitations. Could be nothing serious but you never know. You should go get it checked out:)|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	you should see a doctor since it could be minor or very serious   heart illness to thyroid   may thing can cause this|`|z9DvICCuaa	they are called palpitations|`|2sycPf8Daa	Heart palpitations cause the sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats. Although heart palpitations can be worrisome, they're often harmless.     Often the cause of heart palpitations can't be determined. However, occasionally, heart palpitations can be a sign of a serious, underlying problem such as hyperthyroidism or an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Arrhythmias may include very fast heart rates (tachycardia), unusually slow heart rates (bradycardia) or an irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation).     If you're concerned about heart palpitations, consult your doctor. He or she may recommend further evaluation such as heart monitoring tests. A good Internal Medicine doctor should be able to work through the potential causes of your symptoms:  Take care always! OIRAM

Find some way to divert your thoughts - go for a walk, do some stretching exercises, listen to fun music, soak in a  hot bath. .. anything you can think of to relax.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	When I get stressed out I start to shake. Its from stress, loss of sleep and not taking care of yourself. If you can you should see a doctor or try to shut down your thoughts for a while.|`|xCfub799aa	When John was in coming out of his dissociative state he had the same problem.    Shaking hands, shivering body that sort of thing.     I think it's a mixture of lack of energy from not eating (I get a bit shaky when I'm hungry) and stress, as well as your panic attacks.  Shaking is a symptom of collapse.    You know, it wouldn't be a bad idea to go to a GP and get yourself checked out and mention to them your lack of eating and your depression, they can point you in the right direction.    I'm glad your dad forced you to eat somehthing, that's good.    You know, he may be gruff with you and angry and rude but he does care, no one wants to see their son shaking, depressed and malnourished.    Try and get better! I know that I am, starting with my enrollment in a treatment centre tomorrow.    Kisses to you Connor!|`|PLZrvfFEaa	Usually shaky hands are a sign of muscle pressure, un-relaxed muscles, or depression. Maybe you should think things through.

Don't let faith ruin your life.|`|XlkdUXkcaa	too low blood sugar?    u should eat somthing, best thing u should do.  maybe a candy bar?|`|BU6pYizfaa	it's stress related. I know B-vitamins help relieve stress, so go to the store and get some b-vitamins from the pharmacy. That should help a little bit, i don't know how much though because of how much emotional and psycological stress you are under right now and your depression. I would say get some sleeping pills to help you sleep if you're having trouble(i'm sure you aren't sleeping well), b-vitamins, and start forcing yourself to eat. You should feel better in a few days.  I know it's not really time for fun and games, but you should really watch your favorite comedies to make you laugh a bit, it releases a stress reducing chemical in your brain that also makes you feel good. Try all these things and you might feel better.   Although you should ask the pharmecist about the b-vitamins and sleeping pills, i'm not sure if they mix well.  I really do hope you feel better soon.|`|stWGfFeTaa	i cut my shoulder once and then my arm was twitching a lot for a few days, but thats not realy related, when im about to have an attack, i feel phisicaly cold, i stop breathing, i get bumps all over, and shiver a littel. sometimes i just dont think to eat, slips my mind and i never feel hungry or i just dont care enough to but, im still here and healthy for the most part. the hands shaking i think is stress related. i wish i hadnt read this cuz now i feel hungry and my arm is twitching again. i think its mental and will go away although it does sound like u had a major panic attack or seizure. you should tell your parents about that. you could die during one of those, like having a heart attack or slamming into something.  just stop thinking about, know there is nothing u can do and wait it out. when ur calmed down and ur not thinkig of it but, u notice ur hand is still twitching, id get it checked, could be related to the possible seizure

dqszKQfBaa	Being 6'1" and weighing 155 lb. is not "damn skinny" sorry!  I'm 6'2" and weigh 135 lb. and i could still lose 5-10lb. if I wanted to. I don't think you need to gain weight, I think you have body image issues where you don't think you weigh enough.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	If you're trying to gain weight, you'll need to eat lots of carbs. That is whereyour healthy gains will come from. But since you're very active and growing fast, you're going to need alot of protein too. If you'r eating a good healthy diet and not gaining that is a good sign you don't have enough protein in the diet. To the purpose of gaining weight, it's a good idea to eat carbs right before your workout and protein right after. If you have protein before the workout you will lose it because food moves through your digestive tract 55% faster while you are working out. Carbs are digested quickly anyway and provide energy, so you'll still get most of those calories. Then your muscles need the protein to benefit from the workout so you'll have room for that afterwards.     Here's a smoothie you might like to incorporate into your diet:  http://turtlestruebiz.angelfire.com/Reci...  Peanut butter is really high in protein and in "good" fat, so this would be good for weight gain, especially if you use ensure plus (which is especially designed for weight gain) instead of the yogurt and use a full two tablespoons of peanut butter. The banana and wheat germ also contain potassium and B vitamins which you lose in sweat and during workouts, so it's good to have then too.     Take second helpings whenever you want them, eat lots of pasta and potatoes (but, of course, leave room for the meat and vegetables), and feel free to pig out ;) Seriously, it's better to eat something every couple of hours than just the 3 big meals a day, even if you might eat smaller portions at mealtime.     Here's something else to think about: if you have just a piece of toast for breakfast, your stomach is going to be empty in 25 minutes. However, if you add a little peanut butter to that toast, your stomach will react to the specific fat that is in that and release an enzyme and really digest it thoroughly so something will be in there for 3 hours and you'll use every last bit of it. So peanut butter is yur best friend. So is milk--how about whole milk?|`|DOVbF4Piaa	The best gains will be had by eating right and exercising.|`|gdUyGntpaa	i dont know of anything you can buy at your local nutrition shop. you should ask the people in the shops for advice and see if they can recommend anything.. but if you wana gain weight but still be healthy continue excersising but eat fried foods but use olive oil and put olive oil in salads..... eat lots of nuts (brazil nuts contain the most fat) and cheese and drink plenty of milk.  hope i helped  x

dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	I think you mean strep throat.    If someone in your family or at school has strep throat, there is a chance you may get it. Strep throat is spread when healthy people come into contact with people who have it. When a person with strep throat sneezes or blows his or her nose and you are close by, or if you share the same forks, spoons, or straws, the bacteria can spread to you.    If you get strep throat, you will start to feel sick within 5 days after you have been around the person who gave it to you.|`|mAp90hEeaa	The other answerer gives correct information but, you should be taking some tylenol or ibuprofen on a regular basis for the throat pain, resting as much as possible, taking an over the counter decongestant which will help with the stuffy nose and if it gets progressively worse and worse, consider getting a strep test done to see if any antibiotics are needed.
kjOsSmM0aa	Okay, I have a 7 1/2 month old daughter whom I just took to the ER today thinking that I really didn't need to take and it turned out that if I hadn't, she would have probably been dead by tonight. So you're always better safe than sorry. If you're worried about it, you should go to the ER. You may be having an anxiety attack or you may be having a heart attack. It could be either one. Just go and you'll be better off if it was nothing than you will be if you choose not to go and it was something.  Please, for your own safety, go to the ER.  God Bless!|`|6sxLBLxgaa	YES, you should either get an earlier appointment or go to the ER.  Why take chances.  There are many new medications for anxiety but this could be just a symtom of an underlying condition.  The sooner the better because the waiting is just causing more anxiety..|`|MHcMY2Pfaa	speaking as an EMT, tons of caffeine and nicotine can aggravate preexisting conditions such as Angina which is what this sounds very similar to.  See the Doctor get your heart checked out because bad things can fester for a long time and when they finally go it can get deadly very fast, especially heart related issues.  Cut back on the caffeine and smoking and that should relieve some of the pain if the stimulants are in fact aggravating the problem.    SO GO SEE A DOCTOR and get your heart checked out.  if you get symptoms like severe chest pain and tingling of the extremities, pain that radiates out to the shoulders and/or cold sweaty pale skin and it's doesn't dissipate in 10-12 minutes then you should call 911.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	if you are that scared why haven't you seen a Dr ???   if you know it's bad to smoke, why do you do it ??? if you know you're anxious, why don't you calm down (and don't tell me you can't...)(and the word is nausea)|`|fdP9UJOsaa	So wait, you've been smoking since the age of 12?

I can't tell you what's going on exactly, but it sounds like a more serious case of mitral valve prolapse and caffeine will make that worse... If that's the case, you'll likely be fine until you can go in to the doctor if you stick to decaffinated coffee and don't do anything physically demanding. However, if you ever start feeling faint or the dizziness or chest pain are severe then you should go to the ER.|`|AA11113174	Fluttering heart can be from a lot of caffine.

You will probably not be prepared for the (half) marathon in time and instead you'll stress yourself out and sabotage your diet. You will not lose 10 pounds in one month unless you're gigantic right now, nor should you but you could easily lose 5 pounds the first month. Also let me recommend running every other day at the most (MWF with the weekend off works well for most people). Running 6 days a week is setting yourself up for injury especially since you're presumably starting from a low fitness level.|`|hnR6SR4Raa	thats tooo much.  u wonna loose weight start slow. dont eat after 6 and whenever u feel like snaking eat an apple. yeah u shud run in the morning till breakfast . run + walk( if u get tired) for like an hr. or 2.. and remmeber eat a big breakfast.. :) this way u are healthy and slim :)|`|rVAZyPiWaa	of course you can loose weight I just don't think you realize how long 6 miles is. so good luck with that.

Hips, thighs, you name it.  I was miserable.  I'm the happiest person these days and for me that's great to say because that wasn't always the case. Around two years ago I tipped the scales at 288 pounds and felt miserable. The holidays were on us again and my brother had brought a friend of his by the house for the holidays. We got to talking and weight loss came up and he said how he had lost quite a bit of weight recently with the help of hoodia. Instantly I was intrigued and looking back now I see that evening as one of the turning points in my life.  To his urgings I purchased some hoodia from a very informative online site and to date I have lost over 120 pounds. Hoodia is the best appetite suppressant I have ever used, period. I fully attribute my weight loss success to hoodia and my life that I have today because of it.   Seriously though, if you really are serious about wanting to lose weight and are fed up and jaded by all the fad and B.S. diets and diet plans out today then give hoodia a shot. It really works.

o0JD0hitaa	Getting a massage at home is generally one of the more expensive ways to get a massage, going to the office or home office of an independent therapist is generally more cost-efficient.    However, the two links below will help you find a massage therapist anywhere in the USA. The first is through the AMTA, the other is through the ABMP.

In many places massage therapists have to have so many hours of practice legally (usually 600-1000) and thus practice on family members, etc in order to gain the experience needed.  So I would call a school, let them know your predictament, and see if they will help find a student that would like to volunteer.  Many students would appreciate the chance to work on the elderly.|`|WVNMnvXLaa	girl on girl....nice|`|7e9105250e216e6f1ae0dde9f25dd1c6aa	you should look in Yellow pages and ask for a female one or just google it.|`|g54r6hqFaa	try craigslist for your city in the therapeutic section...
NrOg2hrZaa	Your body becomes accustomed to your regular routine.  That's why you don't feel the burn.  Change it up a bit.  Start with less weight and continue to add until you find the weight for that day that your comfortable with and feel the burn.  My daily weight for crunches varies depending on a lot of factors.  (I'm tired and trying to work out anyway, I'm sore from yesterday's workout, etc.)  I realized that's it's OK to skip a day or 2. (No More than 2)  When I take a break for a day or 2, I find that I'm hitting it more aggressive than ever after that.  Today I did a 2 hour workout.  My normal is 1 hour and 15 Minutes. (4 day's per week)  Treadmill and Lifting weights.|`|Jo0iPN67aa	Yeah i struggle with the same thing. I achieved my 6 pack but i can never get the burn anymore.....its very unsatisfying.
204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	I'm guessing from your question that this is unusual for you.    I have something like that happen with my periods and it's because my uterus is tipped, so when the flow is light, it makes it hard for it to empty fully, so it stops and then starts again once gravity forces it out.    UPDATE:    I should add that I found that if I strenuous exercise and/or massage my abdomen in downward strokes with a back massager, that this tends to aid a tipped uterus in emptying.  Give it a shot.|`|Ogh2zd7eaa	its probably normal, go to the doctor|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	it's normal.. my period lasts for a really long time, a whole week :[|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	it just happens....

FVDTXM68aa	I had that problem a year ago and I'm also a dancer. I had a pinched nerve in my neck that somehow messed up my body chemistry. I couldn't figure out the reason for a couple of weeks! My heart would race and I also had two incidents of numbness on the left side of my body. I went to the hospital, then they referred me to a neurologist. I would suggest going to your doctor to get examined. Maybe you pulled a muscle during dance. I do ballet, in addition to hip-hop (and some break), and I ended up over working my body which caused my stress/tight muscles and pinched nerve. I hope this helps!! I know its scary, believe me!! Being rushed to the hospital twice because of a racing heart is not fun!! Good Luck, sweetie!!|`|bEbkV69naa	C'mon you should tell the instructor and your parents about this.

It's no big deal to tell about it.|`|PN5wdj9Daa	Sweetheart, first of all, you cannot trust answers you get online. 2nd even if one of us were really skilled at diagnoses, you haven't given enough information for us to know what the correct one is.  You really need to tell your parents or the school nurse and have some further testing because this could be something very serious and I can tell you are already afraid that that might be the case.  The more you worry the worse it might get.  I am praying for you, okay?
UIpobEThaa	Gabe, it's just because of all u have been though, and I think that when you tell others, and get all cagey, it's cos it's been so hard and so real for you, and sharing that is intense.  I am a mild Bipolar2, with anxiety disorder.  Your diagnosis isn't funny, and neither is mine, but hey, we keep going, and helping others with mental issues actually makes me feel like I am doing something good.   I have seen you post, several times, and from your posts, I think you are such a sincere, thoughtful and terrifc guy.  I am not hittin on ya, it's just the truth.  See the effect you have on a woman you don't even know is alive?  Thank you for being you.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It is more than likely because you are then going back in time, and also dealing with your own problems when you are doing this. When you talk to others about your own experiences, it makes you figure out a little bit more about your own problems in trying to help them out.   It could make you a little panicky, or even scared. You yourself don't understand the whole situation with your problems, and talking about it probably also makes you a little nervous.   It could be too then talking about it makes your brain dumb a certain neurotransmitter and you get excited about talking about it, and if it dumps too much of this transmitter you would get a little too excited about it. Even feel like you are going to be nauseated... That neurotransmitter is called dopamine...  Chances are if you are feeling good about helping others, and you are thinking that in telling others your own problems in hopes that they will be able to get actual help and over come their problems.... that your brain is dumping dopamine, i can explain it to you further if you'd like later on.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	It can be painful to relive experiences in your mind.    This reminds me of a message that I answered a few nights ago.  A gal had a very sick dog that was probably going to have to be put down because of cancer.  She just found out and very sad.  I wrote a message to her.  When writing to her, I related a similar experience that I went through, how it affected me, how I dealt with it, and how things continued.  When I got to the end of my message, I was crying so hard I could barely see what I was typing.      The point is that I was trying to use my experience to help her.  To do this, I had to relive some of the terrible pain that I had gone through.  Despite the pain, it was very important for me to try to help her.      I am Bipolar II.  I think that often accounts for me being easily caught up into things and having a problem letting go.  Maye just trying to think more about what you are doing and saying will help to relax you.  I have to really work at this.  It does not come easy.    Take care.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	It may be a combination of anxiety over sharing something so personal (to someone you might not know well) and excitement, because it's an issue that carries a lot of emotional weight for you i'm assuming.     I get the same feeling when discussing a topic with someone, and i feel strongly about a certain issue. The topic is both deeply personal and exciting to me, yet i feel anxious that my heart is beating so fast....it is so emotionally loaded.     If you are bipolar, perhaps you just feel really strongly about what you are sharing...you may have some worry about how you are coming across b/c it is so personal. Then, it compounds itself because you know you're shaking. Do you feel manic when this happens? Have no idea if it has anything to do with BP1 or not.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	You are thinking about what happened to you, like a flashback. It's normal to feel when you think/talk about something traumatic you've been though.      Is this making you shaky now? It could be anxiety and where your emotions are just taking over along with your want to help that person.    You might need to go to therapy if you haven't already or some program to help you with this. Or coarse you will never forget what happened, but learning how to control this is something you need to do. You could go to your doctor and see what they think.    I'm glad you like to help people who have been through the same things =) Know that you are helping them and they appreciate it. Know that there is a good reason you are here and talking to them. You are doing a kind deed. The past is in the past, and no matter how horrible it was, it is helping you to help people now. Don't let it get to you.
AA10906062	I would think drinking ALOT of water and peeing alot should wash out the salts from your body which could be causing you to have high blood pressure.Honestly that is just a guess on my part.

kPG2g4iSaa	You've described some of the symptoms of depression. Here are the diagnostic criteria for depression straight from the DSM-IV (the manual shrinks use...)    Criteria for Major Depressive Episode  A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.    Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical condition, or mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations.    1. depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.   2. markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective report or observation made by others)   3. significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), a decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children, consider failure to make weight gains.   4. insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day   5. psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feeling of restlessness or being slowed down)   6. fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day   7. feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick)   8. diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)   9. recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide   B. The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode.     C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.    D. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).    E. The symptoms are not better accounted for by Bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation.    If you think you are clinically depressed, I recommend you go see your Doctor. I know a lot or people don't like to take pills, but your Doctor could prescribe an antidepressant (there are at least a dozen different ones) that can relieve your symptoms. If you need to take medication for your symptoms, just think of the medication like having to use a crutch after a leg injury - you don't expect to use it forever, but you sure need it now.    Most people who suffer from clinical depression get better in a few months. I hope this is your case.  Good luck.|`|kX7zK2aTaa	Some of the symptoms are lack of sleep, you cry and you don't know why, you want to be isolated from everything, you don't want to do anything you like to do anymore     We just learned about that in school     Hope it helped|`|T547TtDRaa	I would look at the website "Web MD" and look up the symptoms of depression.  If you match a number of the symptoms, you might want to seek professional help.  Many people suffer from depression sometime in their lives.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  You can also look up the telephone number of the local Mental Health Association in your area and speak to someone, or someone in your County's Mental Health Department.  No one will ask for your name.  It's all confidential.|`|4kfljeIGaa	I think leveretth's post was right on and very thorough, but two other disorders I thought of when I read your description of some of your symptoms were Generalized Anxiety Disorder and ADD/ADHD.

If you find your symptoms to be persistently interfering with your job or your quality of life, then I would definitely see a doctor.|`|0rpN2419aa	Feeling tired all the time, frequent insomnia, more sensitive to people critizing you (taking things way too serious) , lack of concentration, feel like you are in a brain fog, you will feel anxious over things and worry excessably, make excuses for not wanting to go our and spend time having fun with your family, Maybe you eat more than usual, or maybe you try to fix your depression with wanting to eat more.
rpnFxnCQaa	It is also known as cerumen.    It is a mixture of viscous secretions from sebaceous glands and less-viscous ones from modified apocrine sweat glands. Does that help? :-)    The primary components of earwax are the final products in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, namely, squalene, lanosterol, and cholesterol. You asked! :-)    Perhaps more interesting (or concrete, at least) is that there are two distinct genetically determined types of earwax: the wet type and the dry type. Asians and Native Americans are more likely to have the dry type of cerumen (grey and flaky), whereas Caucasians and Africans are more likely to have the wet type (honey-brown to dark-brown and moist).|`|cj7yMrAiaa	oils in the ear and dead skin, Simple.

l43NSgHyaa	HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases around today.   Also, HPV can be contract even if you use a condom.  It has to to with skin to skin contact and even with a condom, you still have that sometimes.  You are still getting close to each other private areas and fluids during sexual contact, even with a condom.    Honestly, there is no test for men. So, the chances he knew he had it are very slim.  If you love him, you'll get over it.  I'm sure he didn't mean to give this to you on purpose.    Also, it's important to know that HPV can be controlled to some extent.  You need to visit you doctor often, have regular PAP Tests and talk to your doctor about getting the HPV vaccine, which can help prevent some forms of cancer associated with this.     In many cases, HPV even clears up on it's own and has little interference with your daily life.      I understand where you are coming from, no one wants to get an STD.  But, HPV is really the one STD with the least amount of stigma associated with it and having it does not make you a whore or a bad person.   The best thing to do is talk to your doctor about this and get all the information possible.  The more info you have, the less you'll feel like this and you'll stop blaming your boyfriend or feeling like he gave you this horrible disease.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	do u still wanna be with him? did he know about it, and not tell u? my boyfriend gave me hpv 7 years ago, and i'm still with him, i still hate him for it sometimes, i should have left him then when i found out, maybe i wouldn't have got herpes from him too, a couple months later! there's not much u can do, it's up to u to decide if u wanna stay with him or not|`|Yx5iSat4aa	I'd stay with him.

Don't try going anorexic anymore, that isn't going to help you.     Building confidence sounds like the only way to get over this. I'm sure there is nothing wrong with how you look. You are 10 pounds underweight, so most people are going to call you skinny, not fat. If they call you fat then they are most likely insecure with themselves too and are letting it get to their heads. Work on liking yourself more. Get a new hair cut, buy some new clothes, something that will boost your confidence.

cNzBfgFnaa	Teeth are numbered starting on the upper right, number one being a wisdom tooth and number 2 being the second molar.  16 is the upper left wisdom tooth and number 17 is the bottom left wisdom tooth, ending with number 32 that is the lower right wisdom tooth.  If there are additional teeth, we call them accessories.  The only numbers we use are 1 through 32.      Childrens primary dentition is alphebetical.  A through T,  and we call it mixed dentition when primary teeth are shed and perm. teeth come in.      So, 1-16 are on top from right to left  and 17-32 are on bottome from left to right.      A-J are on top from right to left   and K-T are on bottom from left to right.    Hope this is of help to you.

If it's 103-104 then of course you might want to give him some tylenol.  The last thing you son wants with a high fever is a bath so just save the cool water bath for temps in the area of 105-106.      From the MayoClinic.com   About Febrile Seizures    A febrile seizure is a convulsion in young children caused by a sudden spike in body temperature, often from an infection.  Watching your child experience a febrile seizure can be alarming. It may last only a few minutes, but it may seem like an eternity.     Fortunately, febrile seizures aren't as dangerous as they may look. A seizure triggered by a sudden fever is usually harmless and typically doesn't indicate a long-term or ongoing problem. Often, a febrile seizure occurs before parents even realize that their child is ill.   http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/febrile...|`|6fjMtWboaa	Call Dr.|`|vzZE0ktYaa	Give him a warm bath.|`|8lchebCNaa	WHEN MY KIDS GET FEVERS I ALWAYS GIVE THEM TYLONOL THEN PUT THEM IN A LUKE WARM BATH...

ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment).     It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor.     (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see http://www.mercola.com/ SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, dont follow the typical normal reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that youre looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements.     (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55). If 5HTP is used to boost serotonin levels, (which are low in depressed people) it is best taken with a high carbohydrate, minimal protein meal, like pasta, with tomato & basil, and avoid protein for 90 minutes, before, and after, to maximise the amount crossing the blood/brain barrier.|`|QAmglqehaa	no im 13 and i havent went out of my house for like 6 months i just go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study and sleep and go to school and come home study|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	Find a different Dr.!

KAyVeRezaa	It's okay to laugh at things. Be more open and nicer to people. In the next few years, you'll be having students looking up to you. Just be confident in everything you do. You just have to understand what people like and dislike. Be a people person.     The whole "Don't flatter yourselves" line kinda egged on the idea of you being a "Creeper" so that was probably not the greatest of comebacks. Overall if people don't like who ya are then they'll just have to deal with it.|`|XpaLyWYOaa	I'm sorry you feel there is something wrong with you. Everyone goes through phases. The "creeper" comments could just be from your appearance, anything from how you dress to the way your hair is cut, or how hygienic you may be.. or not be, even how you walk(slouching or walking hunched over gives off a major creeper vibe). And to overcome the social awkwardness just takes practice. You have to put yourself into more and more situations however uncomfortable you may feel and just converse about random things non-technically related. Practice makes perfect, or at least helps you get better at something.     You should also try breaking out of your shell a little. Try other hobbies. Just try things. I started rock climbing and bouldering and love it so much now!     And to try and lighten up a bit, try watching Comedy Central or seeking out comedy's and just let yourself laugh. It's not healthy to take life so seriously you keep yourself high strung all the time.     Get involved, volunteer, join clubs, meet people. I'm shy too so I understand it's hard sometimes but you just have to do it. You will be so glad you did.     You are not weird. You are just young and learning how to find your niche. Set goals for yourself to find more hobbies or talk to people more/be more friendly, make yourself more approachable, and try to not ignore people, be nice (it's hard for people to have a problem with someone who is nice). Then figure out the best ways of going about accomplishing those goals.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	You sound normal to me, soon you will leave this place and what seemed so important and stressful will fade away into yesterdays memories.

Sucks though...cuz you have to get used to having a 24/7 wedgie.    Tanga - It looks alright. Not my favorite choice.    Boxers- comfy...but you have to get used to them. They constantly brush against my package and it causes discomfort/...other inappropriate things    Jock straps- what I replaced my 'thong phase' with. It gives you quick access to some physical action [when you're getting it from the butt]    Boxer-briefs- constantly roll up.

Now, heres the Kicker! I was told by my aunt that even good brand like Oscar Meyer hot dogs had worms in em and it was called "Erythorbate" I used to love those little dudes with lots of sauerkraut on em plus even if it was spelled differently, the word bate [bait?] stuck on me so i sent a letter off to the Company and they said Erythorbate was a plant based flavor enhancer and they did not use worms but in fact other wiener companies did and the way to tell was to look at the list of ingredients and if it said "meat by products" that meant worms that were dehydrated. I just don't like the idea of eating flesh. Oh yeah, I dint drink body fluids from a cow either.|`|BN5nW4rZaa	you cant really beat the nutrition you get from eating meat, really if you can careless about animal's "feelings" there is no reason to be a vegetarian|`|KC5vBg4uaa	Both can help or hurt if you eat right.    I personally am a vegan for the "animals have rights" reasons that you seem to hate.  I don't care much for my dietary health because I am underweight so I eat lots of vegan junk food.

You aren't going to get any sleep and at the very least you can have an injection to stop the diarrhoea.   The cramp and burning is probably a symptom of whatever is causing the diarrhoea (food poisoning, gastro-enteritis or whatever).   Go and get some treatment - don't wait for your appointment tomorrow.
RJ4E6m97aa	As far as I know genetic counseling is usually used when parents want to avoid a certain disease, illness, or disorder they can pass on to their children. The genetic counselor runs tests on the parents then provides them with the chance/odds of their child being born with some unwanted disorder. I assume that counselors could check for mental disorders but unless there is no family history it is unnecessary. There are so many illnesses and disorder out there that testing for them all would be extremely time consuming and expensive. As mentioned before family history is very important and some parents choose not to have children and choose to adopt.

They WON'T already be thinking you have an ED, but they probably will ask more questions regarding diet and stuff. In my experience... mental health pros are always very subjective and not quick to jump to conclusions. Basically, they will find things out for themselves and not just accept what is being told to them from a higher-up.    Don't be on the defensive, odds are they will be very inviting and it will be a relief once this issue is sorted out and misunderstandings are cleared up.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	lol they wont force you to eat. they are therapists. they are there to help. they just talk to you. get your problems out in the open. and also dont try lying about something, they went to school 4+ years and have seen dozens of people, they can tell when your lying and holding back|`|QkL7PcJHaa	guess it depends what therapist you go to.  i go to creative music therapy, she never talks about eating disorder, my mum moaned to her that she should 'fix it' she said 'thats not how i work' something else but i didn't catch it. the therapist i went to before was just like 'your not fat' 'most teenagers have this these days' maybe its hormones' lololol yah suuure anorexia is hormones but to the point, they can't force you to eat.|`|bqUudCY8aa	i lie a lot when i used to go to therapy.  if you're seriously not, then just be like: i don't have an eating disorder. so i don't need to be here. and then refuse to talk until they get fed up and say they can't deal with you.  haha.     that happened to me once. they said: "they can't help you unless you tell us something."  and then they made me switch therapists, but eventually, i said i didn't want to go anymore because it's causing me stress and making me angry so my mom let me not go anymore.  haha.    helpful?|`|4kfljeIGaa	No, I don't think you should be scared to go to a therapist.  It would be impossible (not to mention unethical) for him or her to force you to do anything you don't want to do or try to brainwash you.      But if I may respectfully submit, it seems apparent from the way you've written your question that you ARE quite scared to let go of any potentially problematic attitudes or behaviors about eating.  A therapist certainly can help you discover and process why that might be.  (I'm not pointing that out to be rude or contentious, it just seemed to warrant making a note of, so please don't be offended!)  A therapist can make suggestions, but it is your choice to implement those suggestions.  The therapist can only be as helpful as you want to allow him or her to be.

Most cold medicines are multisymptom remedies that contain two or more drugs, although you can also buy these drugs individually. The drugs include antihistamines for alleviating allergy symptoms and helping you sleep, antitussives for suppressing coughs, expectorants for loosening up mucus, decongestants for relieving stuffiness, and analgesics for easing aches and pains.    Remember that no drug is 100 percent safe for all women, so it's a good idea to check with your doctor or midwife before taking any kind of medicine during pregnancy. Don't take more than the recommended dose and, if possible, avoid taking anything during your first trimester, when your developing baby is most vulnerable.    Here are a few drugs that are okay to take during pregnancy:    The antihistamines chlorpheniramine, loratadine, doxylamine, brompheniramine, phenindamine, pheniramine, triprolidine, and diphenhydramine are considered low risk during pregnancy, but they can make you sleepy, especially doxylamine and diphenhydramine.    The expectorant guaifenesin thins mucous secretions in the respiratory passages, making it easier to cough them up. While some studies have found an increased risk of inguinal hernias in babies exposed to this drug, others have not.    The cough suppressant dextromethorphan got some bad press after one study found that it caused birth defects in chick embryos, but this study had many flaws and is generally not given much credibility. What's more, some good studies of women who took the drug during pregnancy have found that it doesn't raise the risk of birth defects in humans.    The local anesthetic benzocaine is combined with dextromethorphan in one product to treat sore throats. Benzocaine doesn't get into the bloodstream, so it doesn't pose a risk to a developing baby.    The pain reliever and fever reducer acetaminophen has been well studied. It's considered safe to take during pregnancy as long as you take no more than the dose recommended on the label.    Here are some drugs to avoid:    It's best to avoid the decongestants pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, especially in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, since there have been some reports of birth defects. Although the risk appears to be low, it could be higher if you're a smoker. After 13 weeks, occasional use of these medications  for example, once or twice daily for no more than a day or two  is probably safe. More frequent use, however, can reduce blood flow to the placenta.    You'll also need to avoid the pain relievers aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sodium salicylate, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When taken in the first month of pregnancy, NSAIDs have been shown to cause some women to miscarry. New information also suggests that use of NSAIDs in the second and third months of pregnancy might increase the risk of birth defects, particularly those involving the heart.    When used in the last trimester of pregnancy, NSAIDs can cause major toxicity in the unborn child. Finally, when aspirin is taken within a week of delivery, it can increase the amount of bleeding when you give birth.    One final caution: Some liquid cold medicines contain alcohol in concentrations as high as 4.75 percent. Look for products that are labeled "alcohol free."|`|AA11922229	Tough it out, stay warm, drink lots of liquids, avoid fever, and ask a doctor or a nurse.|`|g6zhJQRyaa	Breathe in steam from the tea kettle or hot water faucet.

zotCYH89aa	a month till what, a hot date? don't worry about a small bit of fat, most people are never as conscious about it as you are.   But since you asked the question, cut your carb level a bit, especially alcohol and sugars, and this is real important- try to stay away from carbs altogether in the evening hours like 3-4 hours before bedtime. When I was lifting heavy I used to have steak and eggs an hour before bed and I stayed strong and lean.   Walking long distance is great for fat burning, remember that you don't burn fat until 30 minutes into a workout, and who can run an hour or more? However anyone can WALK for an hour and a half, and it's not so strenuous that you'll burn muscle off.   Finally a good tan always makes your muscle stand out.   good luck.   Oh, and I'll let you in on a little secret....  the body parts guys worry about....  most of the time are the last thing chicks care about.   In this order are what they care about:  Your personality, can you make them laugh  Your butt(only real thing you can work at the gym)  Your charisma, (or power to get what you want from others)  Your eyes  Your heart    really.

uqRb9tAqaa	Totally. I mean, it depends how tall you are too. Weight differences (gains and losses) show up more on shorter people than taller people. If you're short it will be more noticeable by others, but no matter what height you are you will definitely notice a difference and feel better about yourself. But if you lose weight but don't see a ton of a difference ,don't get discouraged. You will definitely look noticeably different by 15 pounds, and by 20 you'll be a whole new person.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Some curvature at the top of your shoulders/base of neck is normal and necessary to avoid chronic pain.  The main thing most people need to do to maintain a normal amount of curvature is constantly monitor their posture throughout the day and keep correcting bad habits until you develop new habits.  The correct posture is letting your shoulders relax without rounding them forward, keeping you chest out  (comfortably), and keep your chin up.  Stretches to maintain posture are helpful.|`|CP3F9OK9aa	Um, i used to have a hunch but now its gone. My parents always told me to walk straight. Thats what i did. Also, you should sleep straight. You can toss and turn once in a while, but do not remain in a curved position. Also, when you sit in front of a computer, or infact, if you sit anywhere, sit straight. Dont slump or slouch. Doing those should help straighten your back. It takes time, and you have to build your back muscles. But keep working on it, in the end it pays off.|`|SslUWT0Jaa	I heard that its a lack of muscle in your back.

551ZBzdLaa	Maybe instead of taking part in school sports or a designated sports program try working out at home with aerobics videos or yoga videos.  I have a yoga ball which can be very good for crunches and help with core exercises.  It can also be used to do squats to strengthen the legs. Also, if you have the budget a Wii console and Wii fit really work to help with time.  You can work out at home and still make progress with the weight you want to lose.  Try and find activities that you can fit into your schedule, whether that be an exercise class or dvds at home.  You could always start going for afternoon power walks during your free time and work with some store bought weights to strengthen your upper body.

YO1w7gpiaa	If you were ill enough to be hospitalized (a week or more you seem to describe) for this length of time, your illness must have been pretty strong at the time.     It can be hard for anyone to single-out one cause to hang all the symptoms on.   Often people with severe symptoms are exhibiting more than one category of problems.    Something you may not have considered, we all are dissociative at one time or another - we all become depressed to some degree - and we all become anxious from time to time.     So, in that way you would be correct that you exhibited more than one issue during your hospitalization.    The stuttering, stammering and slow speech, difficulty concentrating,  an inability to put your thoughts into words or making decisions --  can all come from an emotional/mental overload.   Your internal stress became too strong for you to be able to manage on your own.  These sorts of symptoms are common to anyone who is overloaded by stress.   Seeing these symptoms in yourself can heighten your anxiety, causing you to feel as if a your body is inhabited by a foreigner you don't recognize.  Fears can run rampant when feeling oddly and being in a strange environment, too.   Many foreign feelings and thoughts would cause a person to feel disoriented & dissociated.    The fear of losing your identity could count as a delusion - and yes it would cause a person to become even more anxious.  Medications also play into thoughts and feelings.  The thing to remember is that it was YOU who came to the hospital in such a sad state.   It takes time to find the correct treatment.  It takes time for that treatment to begin to work.    All the while your out-of-control symptoms rage on.   It would be nearly impossible to point out which feeling came from what at any given minute.    Concerning dissociation when viewing your family members.  Yes, it is very possible.   You were not feeling or thinking like your normal self at that moment.   Where your mind's orientation was at that given moment is anyone's guess.    As confusing as the time of your hospitalization was, do try today to think toward your future, putting the pieces back together in a new and more healthy way.   Focus on, practicing being in the present.  -- It will help you to heal.|`|PN5wdj9Daa	Yes, what you describe sounds like dissociative symptoms.  This could be depersonalization or derealization occurring due to severe anxiety and/or agitated depression.  Psychosis does not have to be delusions or hallucinations only.  It can simply be distorted reality.      If you do not feel comfortable with your diagnosis however, I would seek another couple of formal opinions (not online but in the doctor's office.)  In years past it has been common for dissociative disorders to go misdiagnosed.  This is not as bad as it seems in that the medications used are often the same.  Therapy is another story.    I wish you all the best.  You are your own best advocate so keep talking and learning.  How are you doing now? I am praying for you.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Definatly not Dissociative identity disorder, what you expirienced was described to me by my psychiatrist as Depersonalization. it comes when you have severe anxiety.

AA11614449	Staph intoxication usually has one of the quickest onset times from 1-7 hours. Human intoxication is caused by ingesting enterotoxin which is produced in foods that have not been kept hot enough (135F or above) or cold enough (41F or below).      Staph bacteria grow and reproduce at temperatures from 50 degrees F to 120 degrees F, with the most rapid growth occurring near body temperature (about 98 degrees F).

Usually, friends and family dont mind it, so feel free to say your ideas to them, even if u do stutter alot.  with other people, try thinking of different phrases to use.     with me, if i'm telling a story or giving a presentation, i can ususally feel when im about to stutter, and i dread it (which makes it worse), so when i get that feeling, i try to quickly think of another way to phrase what i'm trying to say or pause until the feeling passes.      if you can't avoid this, maybe tell a friend next to you your idea and have him/her say it outloud for u, saying something like "me and (your name) have thought about this and we agree that (insert idea)."      i know it sounds stupid, but oh well. it does work. and, if that doesnt work for u, then maybe go see a speach therapist. there is no way to "take care" of stuttering, but therapists can give you simple exercises to help you manage it to a point. good luck, and no matter what, dont feel ashamed. alot more people stutter than you think.|`|44NNQCuGaa	Give speech therapy a try.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I have several friends who stutter.

hDWaxGgDaa	CRPS is a chronic condition, but it can be put into remission. I was diagnosed with CRPS/RSD when I was 13 after a knee surgery. I was in severe pain for about 3 years when I had a low dose keatmine infusion which has put my pain into remission, and it has been about 10 months now. There is no specific treatment for CRPS/RSD that will cure it, but some treatment options include sympathetic blocks, physical therapy, nerve medications, spinal cord stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, etc. As far as running again, it all depends on how you respond to treatment. I was a competitive figure skater before I got RSD/CRPS, and I have since not been able to return to skating, but I have been able to do lower impact activities such as competitive swimming. My doctor had me on strict orders after my keatmine infusion to not do any activity with high impact for at least 6 months after the infusion because usually injury within the first 6 months after treatment causes the pain to come out of remission. A few helpful websites may be www.rsds.org www.rsdhope.org Good luck, and feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions.|`|AA10481903	It would be wise to have a thorough evaluation by your family Chiropractor.

Pain is constant.   There are a variety of treatments that range from physical therapy for "desensitization" to nerve blocks.      Most of the people I've seen who've had a history of CRPS take about 2 years to really get over it.

DfPyyDssaa	Step1Slow down in bed. Many guys finish quickly due to the fast pace of the sex act. Prolong pleasure by engaging in foreplay for a long time beforehand and then slowly working your way into having sex.   Step2Consider your mood as well as your partner's. If either of you are not into the sex, this can cause a man to lose an erection. Having sex while in a good mood will prolong the act.   Step3Experiment with a cock ring. These sexual devices keep the penis hard for a longer time by trapping the blood in it.   Step4Find out about tantric sex. The sexual techniques involved in tantric sex prolong the orgasms of both the male and female.   Step5Put on a pornographic DVD. Porn can help a man keep an erection longer by increasing their sexual desire.   Step6See about an erectile dysfunction medication.

gPtt8e0iaa	Trust me, running works quite well.     The problem is that fat is not lost where we want it usually. There is no way to select an area that you want fat to disappear from. All that you can do is do exercises that will increase the muscle in your thighs which will make them smaller. Just flex your thighs, I guarantee they are muscular. If you are doing sprint exercises they will be muscular. But if you want to improve upon your thighs start doing sprints up stairs and various inclines. You will definitely see a difference, I know I did.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	You already lost 20 lbs, congrats! Of course running works, if you never ran, you would still be 198 lbs, right? So I think you answered your own question.|`|a3giFcmpaa	well you lost 20 lbs thats something. and actually i got most of my ab muscles for my six pack running|`|uTW2KW9raa	Try different thigh exercises. Focus on them more. Running definantly helps, it probably just got rid of the fat on your stomach though first. Keep on running and you should notice a difference. Remember to measure your thighs to see if there actually is a difference.. because sometimes you can misjudge yourself and how small/big they actually are.
K7x1RHVFaa	This reads like a mild OCD.     A more severe case and you would not ever forget about the locking of the doors. You would be compelled to check the door every time.    The game thing does not fit the pattern. That is more of a reasoned thought than an obsession or compulsion.    The scratch thing could be considered obsessive.     The television thing is in a gray area.    In short, it could be worse and therefore it is inconclusive as to you having OCD.

CZALWNAraa	It's really funny because I've went through the same exact worries that you did not too long ago.  I felt my testicles and noticed that the top/bottom end of a testicles were somewhat lumpy. I looked in the mirror and when my balls hung down, one sagged significantly lower than the other (lumpy part).  I went to the doctor and the doctor [who didn't know shtt at all] checked it out. He didn't do anything but wrote me a note to get an ultrasound.    Results: Everything was fine... the range for the diameter of my testicles were perfectly fine.    My mom is friends with a surgeon and we went to his office. He poked around and felt the testicles. With a diagram, he showed me that everyone has a thing called the 'epididymis'. Since I was going through puberty, it fluxuates larger than after puberty. Everyone has a epididymis that's proportional to their testicle size.  Chances are... that's what you were feeling.  And one testicle is normally heavier than the other. To me, you seem normal. You can do some more research or get an ultrasound if you want... but it's really awkward asking your parents to get an ultrasound for your balls...if you know what I mean.|`|z70USiQsaa	Not sure about the lumpiness but it's normal for the left one to be lower.

I don't think that is good.|`|AA10951302	everyone's testicles are shaped differently. some are big, and some are small. no two are the same. which brings me to the left testicle question. it is prefectly normal for one testicle to be bigger, and hang lower than the other. many men have a testicle that hang lower than the other. as for the lumpy part, that is normal too. i believe u are feeling is the vas deferens. it is what carries the sperm to all the glands, which mixed together produces semen. many men have different feeling vas deferens. some can be a straight line, and some can overlap, and feel very lumpy. based on the info that u gave, i can not determine weather u are fertile or infertile. no even if u can not produce sperm, u will still have seminal fluid. the only full proof way of seeing if u are fertile is to go to ur doctor and ask for a sperm count. there is no other way to tell [for sure]. now, on to cancer. testicular cancer can come in many ways. for the most part, it will show up on the testicle, and will be round, and pea sized. at that point, it is managible, and you may not need to have ur testicle removed. the other common place for cancer to form is in the canales on each side of the penis. to cheak for this, place one finger on top the testicle, not scrotum, and slide your finger up whail pressing twards your body, and slide your finger up into the canal. you will know when u are in the canal. then, turn ur head and cough. if you feel something press down, have it cheaked out. u will know what i mean if u feel it. for more in depth detail, just search youtube under testicle exam. u will find what u are looking for. good luck!!!

If you have a wrap, you should wrap it up so it has a little pressure on it, to give it strength. Then really really take it easy. Maybe lay off the skateboarding and running for those 7 days. Even tho it doesn't hurt when you do those things, not doing them will help it heal.    Most likely it's a strained ligament that just needs some time. If it is still hurting the same or worse after 7 days, you better go see a doctor because there might be something torn or stretched too far inside.

GXiCrhVYaa	I am not sure my answer will  be that informative to you. I have only been on Pristiq for about 6 weeks. I had no side effects and generally feel better since taking it. So I can recommend you give it a try---although, as you probably know, people can react very differently to psychiatric meds.    What complicates my positive reaction to Pristiq is that I suffer from major depression, and I am on multiple meds. I also take lamictal, abilify and klonopin. So it is hard to tell exactly what Pristiq is doing for me versus the combination of Pristiq with the other meds.    Pristiq is chemically very similar to Effexor, and Effexor is known to have harsh withdrawal symptoms unless one tapers off VERY slowly. You should check with your doctor about withdrawal symptoms for Pristiq. I wish you well.

mAp90hEeaa	At your age, this is probably not cardiac related.  More than likely, it is muscular in origin.  Your statement about exercising is a clue.  You are probably doing some sort of repetitive movement which has inflamed some of the muscles in this area.  If you push on the area above your left breast area, you may be able to find a very tender spot where the muscles have become irritated and sore.  To treat this, you need to take an anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen or aleve) on a regular basis until it is healed which can take a couple of weeks minimum.  And, you need to figure out what movement you are doing that is causing this discomfort and try to stop doing it until the area is healed.  For more information, you can go to WebMd and read up on costochondritis and see if your symptoms match.
tluT02tvaa	I've watched alot about emotional eating.And one of the biggest under looked problems is a deficiency in Vitamins.  IRON,Vitamin b12,Vitamin D and an assortment of other nutrients can cause mild depression and trigger emotional bouts of stress when not consumed on a regular basis.    Being on a diet,usually makes us neglect our nutrient intake even more.So if your starting a diet or just eating regularly please take a muilty vitamin.    The food we eat..and the food we don't eat have alot to do with the emotions we feel.Start taking vitamins and eat a healthy well balanced diet,excersize and you should have no problems.    If stress and emotions get the best of you..try to replace the habit of eating with some thing else.(not another neglectful habit,but a self improving habit) You can do a number of things.Taking a walk..doing some aerobics..zone out to some music..while snacking on some sweet fruit.You can even do some beauty treatments..( a woman could always use a good tweeze,manicure,hair wash,hot shower)  Good luck :)  take a look at the link i provided for some of the vitamins you need.|`|0LsRbK2iaa	STOP|`|8SDbOS0caa	I was watching TV a couple months ago and there was this lady that was going though kind of the same thing.

It'll definitely won't be easy but the result will be rewarding. Depending on how much time you have left, you should start on it soon. Normally give yourself at least 5 weeks to lose weight. To start out slowly, try eating less. Don't eat until the package is empty or until you're satisfied, limit yourself. You may have the sweets or whatever but with moderation. And to make up for it, exercise. Do stretches, skip ropes, run, speed walk, etc. Have you watched Bulging Brides? I think after watching it, it'll motivate you to do what you want.     Good luck!|`|Vliaa3QUaa	The fact that you recognize it as an issue is a good first step.     An emotional eater needs to determine what moods, etc trigger the eating behavior. You seem to have a pretty good idea of what does it though, stress and being depressed, etc.    For you, a good alternative to eating might be exercising. Exercising both lowers stress levels and helps depressed moods, because you get a rush of endorphins.     Schedule routine exercise into your weekly schedule and hopefully, you will see a decrease in the negative moods that cause you to reach for foods.|`|6ZkXL8mRaa	DONT EAT NO MATTER WUT!O_O wenev u get the urge to eat so SCREW IT! & go on. thhink of wut u cud do olr sumthing. get a litl hobby or sumthin. its works for me.(im a guy & im not an emotional eater but i do gte the urge to eat wen im bored) so yah i know uwts its like. but find sumthin fun to do!^__^ like play a video game(like pacman or sumthin) very fun & great game lol but u prob dont even know ut that is so.....i duno...clean ur house? rearrange ur closet? do cool pc stuff like answerin ?'s on here? i duno? think of sumthin.!^__^|`|AA11746925	this is probably the worst solution although the most effective. You crave foods because your body has grown dependent on endorphins (the happy drug) which is derived from high sugar junk foods. the best way to de- stress, lose weight, and keep healthy is to take a jog. U'll forget the hunger in abit and instead of putting on u'll lose some, and exercising also releases endorphins so u get your kick. bst of all, you'll feel alot better. as you said, u wanted a solutin and not a quick fix. it means changing your lifestyle and not just symptomatic relief.     here's the part where u try to look for an easier answer.

Actually the basis of therapy for all compulsive/destructive behaviors is to just eventually get you switched into ever milder ones until what you're doing isn't a problem. I'm learning math now personally.    Anyway since you want to lose weight for your wedding the only quick solution is to switch from food to cocaine or meth. Obviously this is a really bad idea and will create worse problems.    But you yourself are aware that the problem is your situation and that things will not improve until you change the situation. Even if you go to therapy all that will happen is that your counselor will eventually make you realize that there is no other solution than that. Only they should do it in a clever way so that it seems like a big revelation that you have on your own instead of them just blurting out what you need to change the moment you say it even though they'll probably have you figured out within a month.    Actually take this moment and think of what any of your reliable friends or family members have said to you about your life and your eating. If people are saying similar things then they're probably right and that's probably what you should do.    fuuu.... failing any of that change the way you eat to regularly include the things you crave and sabotage yourself with in smaller portions. There's an element of rebelling against that which is taboo in your behavior now which makes it more appealing. Even though you're the one telling yourself not to do something it pisses you off just as much as if your parents are saying it. So for example if you stopped forbidding yourself things and ate junkfood at every meal alongside a bowl of soup and a salad then it would hopefully lose some of its appeal. You can try gum too. Just keep your mouth stuffed with gum to stop you from stuffing it with whatever else.    Also you should consider eating smaller or lower calorie meals more often. If you have a meal coming up every 3 or even 2 hours then it's easier to persuade yourself not to snack. You can also try buying raw ingredients and preparing your own food from scratch as much as you can. Either it will be too much of a pain in the *** to keep up or at the least you'll become a better cook and possibly be eating healthier meals.    You could try overeaters anonymous or whatever it is too although just as I said with therapy it's less likely that anything new will come out, there's just a small chance that you might be more motivated to make changes.|`|tEpPgjSFaa	First off, congratulations on this upcoming event. I wish you the best in your future.    Emotional eating is definitely a struggle many people face, and it is not an easy one to overcome. You are already making a good effort by trying to find ways to break this habit. Keeping tempting foods out of the house is another good step.    My friend and I used to go out and eat a couple thousand calories in one night or afternoon. We just went from place to place eating. Now, we are trying to lose over 100 pounds combined. Having a friend there is a lot of help. Do you have any other friends that want to lose weight? Having a friend who can support you can make a world of difference.     You need to work towards the habit of eating when you are truly hungry. If you feel like eating, but it's only an hour after your last meal, try doing something to distract yourself. Go outside, or go for a brisk walk. Sunlight and exercise help release endorphins that help you feel better. In addition, a little exercise will help you lose the weight.    If you still feel like you are hungry after 15-20 minutes of exercising, getting outside, reading a book, or whatever you decide to do, go ahead and eat a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Fresh or frozen fruit, string cheese, rice cakes, and veggies are all great options. Just limit yourself to one serving of whatever you choose.     You also need to identify true cravings. If you are at the store and see some chocolate and immediately want the chocolate, don't get it. Wait it out. Chances are, by the next day, you won't care about that chocolate bar. However, if you go a few days when your mind is just screaming at you: "Chocolate bar! Chocolate bar!" buy a chocolate bar. Or better yet, buy Hershey Kisses or Hershey Bliss or Dove chocolate squares. Eat one and HIDE the rest. It may be hard not to down the entire bag of chocolate. If it's too much of a risk, give the rest of the chocolate away. The trick is to satisfy your exact cravings. If you are craving potato chips, you can eat the pretzels and popcorn, but you will still want the chips. You will save so many more calories if you just eat the chips to start out with.

Good luck!|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Hi sweets, not easy is it.  I've watched my older sister all my life, do exactly what you are doing.   It is not as simple as someone saying just 'STOP',  you have to try & control what is setting you up for an emotional trip to the cupboard, fridge etc.  I know you end up eating stuff because your upset, then you get upset because you've eaten something it is a vicious circle, please I implore you to try & put another coping mechanism in place.  My sister's health has deteriorated terribly - you don't want to traverse that path needlessly for years.    Have you tried going for a walk, cleaning, washing, tidying the house, anything to keep yr mind fr thoughts of food?  If you are really struggling with an issue try writing down what 'you are eating @'.      Have you tried to learn meditation?  It can have very beneficial effects.  I don't mean sitting crossed legged on the floor singing 'UMMMM'.   Put on some nice relaxation music or if you have some on yr Ipod put yr ear buds in, sit in a darkish room & relax, concentrate on yr breathing silently tell yourself breathe in breathe out once you have this down pat you have to NOT think.  It is hard to quiet yr mind, if you practice this effectively it takes your mind off yr emotional food crutch, relaxes you & you will feel much better.   I hope you feel better soon.    Congrats on yr upcoming wedding.   Take care of yourself.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Have you tried chewing gum, like Extra (sugar free)? I do that when I have had the urge in the past to eat due to emotions. They make some really good flavors, like sweet watermelon and berry pearadise. You can pop in a stick of gum and go for a walk or do something that involves your hands or just moving. I wish you the best and I know you can do better, you deserve it. Take care!|`|5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	coffee will fill the stomach & caffeine helps however too much coffee will cause diarrhea  a safer approach may be an appetite suppressor|`|DnJXafIwaa	Be happy or chew gum when you feel like eating. keep busy and away from food but dont starve your self or you'll binge. good luck.|`|bITTzzcVaa	Try not to have unhealthy typed of foods in the house.  Have lots of fruit, veggies, yogurt, and salad in the house so when you want to eat, you turn to foods that are less likely to make you gain weight.    A way to avoid emotional eating is to try and distract your mind with something other than food. Next time you are upset, stressed, or depressed turn on music that is fast paced and it will make you feel better.     Or When you are tempted to go into the kitchen to grab food, instead grab something to drink. I used to have a picture of me at my WORST weight and a picture of my BEST size compared side by side on the fridge, so every time I was hungry, I saw that picture on the fridge and lost the need to eat.    Remind yourself that being able to fit into your beautiful wedding dress is much more satisfying than feeling full for a few minutes.    This is a great site to learn ALOT:  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/weight-...    Good Luck!

You need something to really kick your metabolism.  When your doing cardio you only burn calories while your actually doing the cardio.  When you do light weights with high reps, you burn calories all day long.  Plus stretch and tone your muscles.|`|VXW1XeFsaa	Walking has many health benefits and certainly is good for your heart.  However, if you really want to be thin, you need to do very intense aerobic exercise.  Things like running(not jogging), jumping rope, rebounding, and stair steppers increase the metabolism dramatically and keep it elevated for about the next 24 hours.  Walking burns calories during the exercise, but your metabolism returns to normal after it is over.  I find that I am more satisfied with my workouts if I have experienced the feeling that my lungs are on fire and burning 2-3 times a week.|`|XTVeIeCXaa	not enough to lose lots of weght but will keep u fit|`|T9OLDgngaa	Walking is fine but it all depends on what type of walking.

lplKG5nxaa	Even huge ones should take about the same amount of time as the smaller ones to go away.  Here's an interesting fact that my child's pediatrician told me when he got his first outbreak.  He said that we are actually immune to the cold sore virus so as soon as it breaks out our bodies start fighting it.  The only reason it keeps coming back is because it hides in our nerves ganglia(sp) (anyway, it's something around our nerve cells) and our body can't find it to attack it at the source.  It constantly sends cells to the surface of our skin and ordinarily our immune system will kill it and we won't get a cold sore, but when our immune system gets weak for whatever reason they pop up.  You could keep getting them because of stress, unknown food intolerance or allergy, tiredness, stomach trouble, etc.

zT2aGwzlaa	With all due respect to the previous answerer, her comment about electrolytes was flatly wrong and here's a quote to prove it from the National Institutes of Health article about fatal water intoxication: "Water intoxication provokes disturbances in electrolyte balance, resulting in a rapid decrease in serum sodium concentration and eventual death."    Other than that, her answer to your question is correct: "Don't worry about it (drinking a gallon of water a day)."     I drink that much water most every day. I eat an average (American) diet and dont get nearly as much exercise as I should. Just don't drink it all at once and you'll have absolutely nothing to worry about, assuming you don't have some unusual condition.    People who die from water drinking contests are drinking a *lot* of water all at once (somtimes well over 2 gallons), which quickly dilutes electrolyte levels and can causes brain swelling. Drinking it over the course of a day is a non-issue because you're processing the water out (sweat, urine) while you're slowly taking more in.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	You don't need gatorade to balance out drinking water.

And as for "cupcake" not everyone is a slut that contacts this disease and if you can't say positive thoughts to people please go on to the next question and quit trying to hurt people's feelings!!!!|`|wZa3qiSbaa	I'm just guessing cause this is kinda confusing,what if both of them had it.Why don't just ask them to get tested,then you know for sure who you caught it from,if neither one of them won't then you don't need to to be taking anymore chances with catching another STD.The good thing is that your treating it now and you can learn from this to be more careful in the future.Well hope you get better......|`|4a36b4ba0f0e3d2d8c5fdfc0a36996adaa	get well soon|`|dmxnblomaa	Well Personally speaking from my own experience. I think it could be John who passed it to you. But as you already know you could have had it and not have an outbreak. When I had my first outbreak he did a culture test followed by a blood test to be sure. It actually showed, I know who gave me the disease, Because I was very faithful to him. Just because you have herpes does not make you a slut. To the dummy below! But to be honest it could be very hard if you had more than one partener in a year. Which is common, and this does not make you a slut. Sometimes, things happen. Remember trust no one. Because if they are saying they don't have it, they would have to show me proof. Like me and him would have to get checked out by a doctor. Now for the other dummy who said doctors don't like sluts, get real, I know a doctor and he has had two std. Quit being ignorant to what's going on, for the person that mad the doctor comment. If you actually go to the doctor every year for your pap, they will tell how common herpes 2 is, that why my doctor even have tons of samples, for valtrex and coupons. It has become more common, my doctor also told me that it is nothing to be ashamed of because you would be surprised how many people actually have that mess. Right now I know at least 4 of my friends that have the disease and they are far from sluts, two are married, the other two are in relationships, and live a healthy life. Now personally I would focus my energy on my health, at this point the men in your life could tell you anything. Because a man will deny it to the core just to save self. Hope this helps|`|OOL4XdjPaa	stop being a hoebag.. and it would't matter.. now would it?|`|wpO1GNMLaa	dont be a fool, wrap your tool|`|fk9AvB25aa	It could have been either one since (I'm sure you know by now) herpes can lie dormant for long periods of time even after you have contracted it. But with those levels I would think that the first guy you had sex with could have been the one to give it to you. The usual time it takes to develop symptoms is between 2-14 days but it can take longer then that.  This is why it's kind of tricky to find out who passed herpes to you. Levels could build up quickly depending on the person or they could take ages to show any thing.  To the first poster you don't have to be a sl*t to get herpes. I got herpes from my boy friend, we are monogamous for 3 years now and we don't cheat.

Yg1QR4mmaa	Personally, I drink a couple of beers after a bad day at work. I know how you feel, I am the interim supervisor over my department at work and I hate it. My grades are slipping and I have no time for my girlfriend and I think they are going to keep me in the position. It feels good to tell someone that to be honest. If I can give you any advice it is to find an outlet whether it be artistic, physical, or anything. Good luck to you.|`|4UVS0pAsaa	Light up some candles, play some relaxing music, pore yourself a glass of wine and take a nice hot or warm bath. This always works for me.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I usually play some video games. Keeps my mind occupied and not think about anything else.|`|ffJfKTrHaa	I'm sorry you're so stressed out.  I've had a stressful weekend myself, so I feel for you.      Try writing a journal.  It will give you a safe place to vent and maybe even organize some thoughts that are chaotic and dancing around in your head.  It can help you to prioritize if there are a number of tasks that have to be completed.      Also, maybe try a little light stretching or yoga.  Maybe try to clear your mind in a dark room and meditate staring at a candle flame.    Exercise can help you burn off stress, but I wouldn't do it at night.  It could cause you to be keyed up even more.  Save that for morning if you decide to try it.    Good luck to you.  I hope your week improves and that you can sleep tonight.
mqXyDTwwaa	Way too much fat. There's a lot of fat in 2% milk. The "2%" is misleading, because whole milk is 3%. And peanut butter has too much fat and sugar in it. And to be honest, Muscle Milk has too much fat in it, too.    Edit: Mix regular protein powder with skim milk. If you like peanut butter get the kind without added sugar. Muscle Milk costs too much and has too much fat in it. Get a GNC Gold Card and buy GNC whey protein powder when it's on sale, using the Gold Card. It works just fine and it's a lot cheaper.|`|KppM3VzAaa	bit high in fat, depends how often you're taking it and the quality of the protein powder some out there are poor quality|`|07vq1Y8iaa	its not bad  go on my site and check out the supplement of the day  thats the one i use = )  optimum 100%  goodluck  the website is in my profile page

And even if doctors were answering your question, I'm pretty sure they'd have a hard time diagnosing your wife.

Doctors will cauterize it or believe it or not, use medicinal grade cocaine to stop the bleeding.|`|wRo4iV0kaa	I get the same exact thing... it is scary! If it gets to the point where she starts to throw up blood clots then you should IMMEDIATELY  go to the eemergency room to get it clotted. No worrys!

The symptoms may be the same as those of a fractured nose.    First Aid       1. Reassure the patient and try to keep the patient calm.     2. Have the patient breathe through the mouth and lean forward in a sitting position in order to keep blood from going down the back of the throat.     3. Apply cold compresses to the nose to reduce swelling. If possible, the patient should hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose.     4. To help relieve pain, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is recommended.|`|t0jC2o0Jaa	You can take her to the doctor. They can find the cause of it and you won't be in any kind of trouble. Most likely it's the weather. It changes a lot.. Or she could be pregnant. It happens... My nose used to bleed all the time for no reason. It was like you touch the skin and it bled. Doctors said I had an irritated blood vessel in my nose. Maybe that's it?|`|55oy2i5caa	Can be pretty common in winter. I had it happen once where it wouldn't stop and went to the ER.

I don't mean to alarm you but there are three possibilities, depending on the symptoms.    1. Broken nose. It would fit with the raccoon eyes. If she has trouble breathing through her nose, or feels pain when she cries/sneezes, it's most likely a broken nose. Doctor.    2. If there is no pain, there is a very sever possibility. If she has ever had a broken nose, or surgery to fix anything similar, or a nose-job, she could have a backed-up blood vessel. What happens is, a blood vessel gets minute damage during surgery, and becomes clogs months or even years later, gets blocked up and bursts/overflows. This is an emergency, people die of blood loss from this. E.R    3. More likely than the previous one, and just as dangerous; she could have thin blood. If she has thin blood and her blood isn't clotting properly, than she will be getting bruised easily, dark flushes/rings/or most other sub-surface marks will become more prominent due to blood vessels breaking under the skin, and having trouble clotting. E.R.    Alternatively, she could just have a nosebleed because of the dry whether. People get that all the time. She'll probably have felt an annoying red rash-like mark around her nostrils, from lack of moisture where the skin rubs together. Pharmacist.
TORBP6QIaa	Yes...you are normal...its not something everyone does but it is fairly common in young makes especially...I do not know what or why it happens just that it does.  The doctors and nurses will be graeful that you have warned them as this can come as a surprise when this sleeping patient suddenly wakes and starts carrying on...as they are aware of your history they will do what they can to try keep you and them safe from harm.
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I doubt seriously medication for depression and/or anxiety stunted your growth.  When you were 22, you had not long finished puberty & were more mature physically & emotionally.  From age 14 to 22 pubety should have been in full swing & all kinds of changes were taking effect within your body.  Mood swings, attitudes, sexual urges, growth in height, penis length, arms, feet, legs, hands, growth of body hair, pubic hair, facial expression, male hormones raging from one end of the spectrum to the other.  Some guys breeze thru it ok & others don't fare well at all.  Congratulations on reaching the end of that portion of your life.  Now, it is time to continue on.
V3mpzjcuaa	I have had two condoms break on me.  But because I was in tune with my body and knowing that there was a sudden change in feeling I immediately pulled out to see the condom broken.     One condom came off. But that is because after ejaculating I remained inside her instead of pulling out.  My penis shrunk to its flaccid state and when I finally withdrew my penis the condom was not on.  I had to fish around in her vagina to find it (I did) but worried about some of the semen spilling out.  She got her period a few days later and we were good. So that was my fault.     I have never contracted any STD's or gotten anyone pregnant so I guess they did protect me. Yes, it worked.     I hold up one thumb up and one thumb down.  I like the fact that condoms protect against STD's and pregnancy all in one package.  But I enjoy being inside a woman with no condom because it feels much better.      Peace|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Well considering they aren't 100% effective. There's a 50-50 chance for each of your question. Some break, some don't. Most of the time they protect (that's if the guy knows how to put it on properly). Some people say that sex feels a lot better without one, but why risk it?     Thumbs up for condoms.|`|oGZs64FLaa	condoms don't feel good for the guy...according to my boyfriend.  i've only had sex with a condom once or twice  and it feels kinda funny.|`|U1LknLaWaa	Everytime I have worn a condom they worked for me.
t0jC2o0Jaa	Two things here.. 1. I'd see a doctor about it for treatment or relief when your on your period and to find the cause... 2. I wouldn't try popping them. You could cause them to spread, or cause your vagina to get really irritated from it.     First and foremost, I'd see a doctor. I don't think I've ever had any bumps like that other than ingrown hairs from shaving.        *EDIT*   They can spread from the fluid they may be inside them. Even if you can't exactly see it, it does not mean that it couldn't spread. Just like when you get a rash, they say don't scratch or it will spread. It's just better safe than sorry when you don't know what they could be yet.|`|AA10136920	Even tho I keep track of when my period is coming, but another way I know is because a bump always grow in down there like 3 or 4 days I start. So I know what u are talking bout, I think it's just how your body works.
bnA0wUPRaa	I'm thinking STD|`|TGMUFytraa	No, it's not normal. I work in the hospital and you need to see a doctor. That's not good.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	It's not normal to have sores at any time. You need to see your gynecologist to get examined so that you can get the proper treatment for whatever is causing the sores.
4AwWgUhqaa	Hi     I asked the same question myself a couple of weeks ago.     I searched the term "mental toughness"     There are many links about sport, which may not be relevant. Other sites are a bit more general which is more for me as I do not play sport and I do not think that some of the metaphors are really that topical for the average couch potato like me.     Some other links like this one approach the topic generally.     http://www.shortcourses.auckland.ac.nz/c...    Best of luck as you sound like a great person.     Owen|`|ZcVhWxoiaa	I completely understand you. I'm experiencing this myself right now. Sometimes it helps to come here and talk to others, however MOST of the time, I find going to the gym and pushing myself to my limits and focusing on what I'm doing at that exact moment helps the most. Tonight it didn't work for me because I'm stressed out to the max, but that is the first time it hasn't worked. Talking to friends helps as well as meditating. Meditating doesn't have to be sitting down on the floor and closing your eyes, meditation can be anything that completely relaxes you; exercise, listening to the type of music that takes your mind off of anything but the beat or sound, taking a hot bath, getting a massage, etc.|`|AA11181101	sometimes its good to dwell over things in your own sleepless solitude, but then it has to be pushed to the back of your mind and forgotten about until you are ready later on to re address these issues, after some time or perhaps looking at things from some one elses point of view may help to over come these issues.    emotions cannot be helped but where and when you show these emotions can be supressed to a time and place that is right to let all of the sh*it go, if that means screaming at the top of your voice or even crying your eyes out it doesnt matter as long as you feel better|`|lmGm5qaSaa	i had trouble dealing with emotions myself. i then took on meditation as it seems to be the best way to cure all of the bodys ailments. check out this website     http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/medita...    mind you its always hard to understand and practice for a while but just like any skill learned, it will take time and practice but its the most direct way to see, feel, and interpret your emotions most clearly. alot of times, the reasons people have mental health problems is bc they are just not aware of whats going on in their head . Too much goes on under the radar and remember the thoughts feelinsg and so on that u may not notice have a say just as much as the conscious thoughts and feelings have a say of inside your mind. just my 2 cents|`|tEmDZIpPaa	well i had the same problem i tried to isolate them in my mind, i did  but for some it helps to think of all possible combinations to make 21 in your head
vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!    As for ways to do it, you have several options:    1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!    2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!    3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).    Above all else, have fun!|`|pIhqD8JOaa	Electric Toothbrush  Shower head  Teddy bear  Pillow  Blistex cool splash lip wear (with round tip):     http://www.uncrate.com/men/images/2006/0...

B4hLK0W5aa	Honey, you're still growing! Look at the chart I linked.  If you're 5'3" you should weigh 128.  You're just fine.  Every girl has felt too this or too that everyday of their adolescence (or 20's...or 30's).    If you're concerned, I'd try starting some healthier habits now so it's easier to continue them for the rest of your long fit life.      *Try your best to ignore people's hurting criticisms. You're what matters.  *Try to move more.  Exercise a little every few days.  It's easy to go up the stairs an extra time.  Walk around the house during commercial breaks, etc... start little by little.  *Try and eat healthier.  I know it's hard to do sometimes when your parents are doing the shopping but you can limit what you do eat, especially the junk stuff.  If you think you over eat, practice putting your fork down and stop eating for a minute to see if your body is full, or if you're just eating because you're bored or out of habit.  *Lastly, Never take any weight loss supplements.  All that's going to happen is you're going to lose water weight; but more likely, you're going to cause more harm to your growing body. You're going to throw your metabolism out of whack, so as you age, you're going to have a heck of a time keeping a healthy weight.|`|wv5PiHxcaa	100 pounds is waayyy too skinny.  130 pounds is a fine weight to be.

Tell your family that you need support instead of just telling you that you are fat (which you aren't!).  You can start walking before school, or going for a run after school, eating healthier foods... don't snack on junk and always take things like celery or carrots for snacks at school so you can avoid chips or chocolate bars.  I started packing healthy lunches for work instead of raiding the snack machine and I've lost 20 pounds in the last 4 months.|`|qmslHwj3aa	Your family is harsh they should not be telling you that.

8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,    It is important to ascertain the cause of runny nose. It can be due to allergic rhinitis or sinusitis and even ear infection.  It will help us to know what the color of the discharge is. If it is yellow or green in color it indicates infection and in this case you will need a course of antibiotics to clear the infection.  I would suggest you to drink plenty of fluids, use a humidifier to increase the humidity and take OTC decongestants.    Regards,  Noopur|`|1KfbgBupaa	For a runny nose you can take a decongestant, easily purchased at any drug store or Wal-Mart, etc.  If this is caused by allergies, consider taking a combination antihistamine/decongestant.
F17bGTAOaa	See a physical therapist - a good one will get you right as rain
CciXZNYraa	Eat nutritious foods that are high in calories. Examples are whole-grain breads, vegetables such as avocados and potatoes, kidney beans, lean red meat, poultry and fish.     Increase the caloric value of your meals. Add powdered milk to casseroles for added calories, add avocados and olives to sandwiches, add wheat germ to your cereal, add chopped meat to your pasta sauce, and so on.     Avoid skipping meals. Knowing how to gain weight involves consistent eating. Eat three meals a day and at least two snacks.     Increase your normal portion size. Take a second scoop of pasta, or add two bananas to your oatmeal.     Choose higher-calorie foods when given a choice. For example, corn is higher in calories than green beans.     Relax - excessive fidgeting and restlessness can burn up a lot of calories.     Add weight lifting to your exercise program. It helps build muscle mass.     Balance your caloric intake with the number of calories you're burning. You need to be taking in more than you use up, and you may need to ease up a little on your exercise program.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	just eat 5 times a day and do small sets of 4-5 with heavy weights|`|uX5hO3d8aa	If you gain 10 pounds in a week, it's going to be 99% fat.

8AoGWNvnaa	Yes, the body does crave what it's lacking.  Often during the first trimester of pregnancy a woman craved red meat - she's producing extra blood and it helps her from becoming anemic.  During my third trimester I craved milk - I believe it was because my son was strengthening his bones.  Yes, these cravings are both pregnancy related because they're the only experiences I have with this particular question, not because it's the only time this happens.      I recently found Godiva 'pearls' in various flavors - they're small, not many calories, and satisfy my urge for something sweet (I have a horrible sweet tooth) without over doing it.    Good luck!|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Sounds like  your on a sugar craving what are you not eating is been heard by lots of people.Try eating there sweets way before going to bed|`|d1DlU0ydaa	I would take a preg test just in case because thats the first thing I noticed.. except it wasn't sweets it was peanut butter lol Anywho if not I would definately say that your body needs something,I would see a doctor they will check you levels for everything by doing bloods and that should give you an idea of what you need.|`|oGZs64FLaa	you usually have cravings during your cycle

When you work out muscle tears and the it heals while you sleep but it heals in such a way that it sort of adapts the muscle to that weight so you become stronger over time. And in toning it just becomes denser.

KNnwUcpqaa	Go to the store & buy some AZO pills. They do wonders for helping the pee stop hurting. Once you take the pills you usually have to pee one more time before they kick in. Basically the pills reduce the acid in your pee (*which is what causes it to burn your skin). Try that, I bet it will help. As far as the itching and pain go, Im not sure what to tell you. The only breakout I had was one small red bump that didn't have any pain or anything, the dr didn't even think it was herpes, but the test came back positive. The only reason I know abt the AZO for herpes is because my cousin had a bad breakout of herpes & she said it helped her. I've used AZO before when I had a UTI.  Are you on pills to help suppress the herpes virus? If not, that should be your next step. If you need to talk to anyone about this you can email me. My username is my yahoo email address. Im only 23 & I have it, Im sure being 18 & having it is hard for you.|`|AZv0ON1Laa	Try peeing in a bath tub if it hurts to pee.Sitting in hot tub of water for about 30 mins usually numbs the itching  and the blisters take about 7-14 days to pop.A little secret way i used to get the blisters to pop early is to put peroxide on them but i must warn you it will sting a little so don't put too much just dabb it on there 3 times a day.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	well when u pee get a cup of water, not hot, and pour it down there while your peeing it will stop the burning when u pee, but u have to do it at the same time while u pee, that's what i did and it helped alot! And if this is the first outbreak, then trust me it's the worst, it will get better, and after u get out the shower/bath, sit in front of fan and let the area dry really good, plus it feels good, the cool air, and don't wear underware if u dont have to, wear something like loose pj's and give it like a week or two to clear up|`|s1gEHdBgaa	Did you go to the doctor? You should see a doctor!|`|V8fLpQpQaa	I'm sorry to hear that. They say your first outbreak is the worst one. Right now, my outbreak is feels similar to the first one I had. I take Valtrex and it helps. That's what you should take. They gave me acyclovir and it made my symptoms worse. There really is nothing you can do, but let it ride it's course out. Valtrex daily will help suppress it in the future and make them less painful. It really sucks when the sores are inside. That's how my first outbreak was and how some of them are when I don't take the meds right away when I know I'm having an outbreak.
pfm0wcEIaa	I had mono.  I didn't exactly have headaches.  But what would happen was that my lymph nodes were so swollen that whenever I moved my head I felt such incredible pain I had to hold on to something so I did not fall and pass out.

9HWexOtEaa	I am rarely stressed because I don't worry about very many things. Take some time to relax, get a hobby or two, and take your time while keeping an eye on it. When you finish a big project and find out that you got a great grade, take some time off later that day to chill. Hang out with some friends, listen to music, do anything fun, just relax for a little while when you get some spare time. And remember that grades aren't everything. They are important and will impact your life later on, but remember that things like sports look good on college applications too. And if you get a lot of colds, then eat more good foods and drink plenty of water.|`|kj507W26aa	Silly thinks works and here is one.  Listen to some classical music, run around the house or the block.

Don't worry.|`|PTwgXnauaa	I know its not comfortable when you are using it for the first time...but i did that too when i had no option. Just dont be afraid.You are not the only one to sue it so its for sure they wont harm...just do it following the instructions properly|`|5e53982f30b91234ea9cdf88659c221eaa	the best advice i can give is to RELAX!!! if you are nervous or scared the muscles in your vaginal wall will tighten and make it almost painful or even impossible to insert a tampon. sooooo when you are about to put it, just breathe and RELAX, try it first standing up with one foot on the toilet and the other on the floor. if that doesn't work then try sitting on the toilet with your knees as far apart as possible. Umm also use a new tampon for every failed attempt.|`|Az1QBR7qaa	okay, it's all about relaxation... you need to calm down and make sure you don't tighten up and freak yourself out.  This is going to sound very intimate, but take a slender brand of plastic tampon and put Vaseline or some kind of lubrication that will make it easier to slide in, even water helps, suggestion, place your finger in with Vaseline on it already it will relax you to know that that's exactly how the tampon will feel and you have control of what it will be like.  It if takes a couple tries that's okay, but don't get yourself freaked out, comeback in 5-10 minutes and try again.  The more stressed out, the more you constrict you're vaginal cavity thinking it's going to hurt, just calmly take vasaline, or even lubricant if you have it and place it on your finger and make sure the entire face of the whole is covered, then penetrate it a little with your finger so the plastic will slide in easier.  Then pus some od the lubricant on the shell of the tampon, take a deep breath, try not to think too much about it and insert the applicator, once that's in you are fine to insert the rest and pull out the plastic and the string should be viable.  to ensure you inserted correctly stand up and walk around a few steps, if you can feel it you didn't push the applicator in far enough, when placing the plastic in your fingers at the base should reach the lips of your lady part.  Please don't freak out, it's very natural, and very normal to feel this way.  You will be fine, just make sure not to wear a white swimsuit if you don't feel comfortable changing consistently (leakage HAHA) You will be fine, and if it takes more time it just does, you will eventually get it in there.

They often start out as reddened, tender   spots which then become hard, painful   nodules that fill with white blood cells   (pus) and form a "head." The skin   surrounding a boil is often angry,   red and extremely sensitive.     If the boil does not erupt and drain   in some cases the skin must be lanced by   a physician to clean out the infection.   Some people suffer from repeated outbreaks   of boils (Furunculosis).
9ZDCN4pAaa	I think for some it is hard to stop popping pimples because there is something inherently satisfying about it. I mean, they're unsightly, kind of painful, and unwelcome. And with a simple pinch, you've killed it. The fact that you're going after your fiance's pimple suggests that you might have a slight obsession with killing them.     Just looking from a behavioral view, you should promise your fiance that you will no longer pop his pimples, and have him hold you to it. Also you should be a little more picky in choosing your pimple battles. Some pimples are deep enough that all the squeezing in the world won't get the puss out, in fact it can push it in deeper.    On the other hand, some pimples have come up so close to the surface (the classic white head) that a very gentle pinch with the tips of your fingers (but never your nails!) will escort the puss right out. You never have to dig for that kind of pimple.    So perhaps you can still pop some pimples, but just make sure that it's a pimple that's ready to be popped. The pimple that's not ready will result in damaged skin and possible scars.     Be sure to follow a sound cleansing routine (witch hazel is a great astringent that is easy on the skin), and be gentle on your skin. Alcohol based products and harsh scrubbing just might irritate your skin, causing your skin to secrete more oil, which will make the problem worse.|`|f19e89jKaa	cut your fingers off that ought to stop you|`|jW9035qTaa	keep diggin you can do it !|`|QY7GVVLzaa	Ok i know it's really temping to pop them...but think about the consequences! You don't want it worst right? Then cut your nails or avoid anything that helps you popping your pimples...    And for the scars - your body needs plenty of vitamin C to b able to fight against acne. Drinking fresh orange juice regularly will progressively fade away acne scars. Vitamin C contributes in the restoration of damaged skin. To be frank, I personally do not like orange but I consume it to keep my skin healthy! Anyways, you may drink any fresh fruits juice rich in vitamin C.
V3mpzjcuaa	Most queefs are a result of air being pushed in with each thrust during sex.  This is mainly due to there being some way that air is entering by way of a gap.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|AA11832138	It Could be the begining of sciatica. This is a condition that does occur while giving birth. Sciatica is a result of a disk bulge at the L5 - S1 of your spine and usually affects one leg. This disk will protrude on the sciatic nerve causing a dull or sharp burning pain deep inside the leg. This depends on the severity of the protrusion. Other indicators could include but not limited to numbness, tingling, weakness in the leg. Many factors come into play. I would suggest that if this pain does not go away in 6 months, seek further advice from a Neurosurgeon.  MD- Plain english

g0aMMzA3aa	Few days ago I answer you a question about blindness in your dog, so I think it is possible you have made this question thinking in your pet. If not...... sorry.    Glaucoma in human being is complely different than in dog. People usually have open angle glaucoma whereas dogs, nearly 100%,  develop closed angle glaucoma, which is much more agressive. Drops, which are very effective in lower the intraocular pressure in humans, do not work fine in dogs. There are some surgical procedures, like cryotherapy, lasser therapy and surgical gonioimplants that can be help us to treat canine glaucomas, but even so, the prognosis is usually poor at medium/long term.     Any way, the aproach to a glaucomatous eye is complete different when the eye is already blind, like in your dog. This kind of blindness is complely irreversible because of damage of the optic nerve.  In this cases the only we can do is maintain these eyes as confortable as posible. Dont forget that glaucoma is a painfull disease. Medical, natural or homeopathic treatments, do not work in dogs. In adition, there is no relationship between food and intraocular pressure so changing feeding habits is not going to help us. Something you can do is to give a little massage to the eye through the eyelid surface. In some situation it can force the acuous humor to leave the anterior chamber decreasing the intraocular pression and relieving the pain, but it is not a solution at all. The only way to guarantee painless glaucomatous eyes is a surgical treatment called intrascleral prosthethic. It work very nice and the cosmethic result is excelent. Enucleation, which mean remove the eye, is the other choice. It is cheaper than  intrascleral prosthethic but for many owners the result is unacceptable. Obviosly both techniques are only indicated in blind glaucomatous eyes.    Siberian husky is one of the few breeds I have seen that develop glaucoma at early ages, many times before one year old. Puppies have very elastic corneoscleral tissue, so the pressure inside the eye makes the ocular globe increase its size much more quickly than in adult dogs.    If you need further information you can email me.

Be more specific.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	well, if you are 5 years old, then you have a problem...a little more info please...height,weight, gender, body type, etc?|`|X9QOHRLFaa	hi the truth is only way to effectively and permanently loose weight is by working out and eating right , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call. it really helped me alot , hope it does the same for you    www.xattack.in

GgcBzuplaa	When you are triggered the best thing to try and do is ground yourself by doing activities such as the ones on this list:    1. breathe slowly and deeply. In for 5 seconds. Hold for 5 seconds. Out for 5 seconds. and keep repeating it over and over.    2. Use your 5 senses. Smell 5 things where you are now. Taste 5 things. Hear 5 things. See 5 things. Touch 5 things. BUT if one of the senses is what triggered you don't use that sense, skip over it and use another one twice.    3. Call someone you trust, like a friend or your T    4. Write in a journal    5. Draw    6. Change your scenery. If you are outside go inside and visa versa.    7. Write poetry or a story    8. Read a book    9. Play video games    10. Write a letter to someone who hurt you. Then crumple it up and throw it away. Put all the thoughts down on paper as if you would show the person but tear it up and never show them. That is a way for you to get it out.    11. Go for a walk or jog. Be mindful, look at your surroundings and feel the sun, rain, snow, hot, cold.    12. Hold ice in your hand. The cold will snap you back to the present and wont leave any marks    13. Snap a rubber band against your wrist. Once again it will bring you back to the present.    14. Repeat phrases such as "I am safe now" "It's over" "It's just a memory"    15. If you have a pet like a dog or cat pet them, brush them, hug them. Pets hold unconditional love for their owners and are amazing at making people feel better.     This list helps me when i have flashbacks about the abuse and assaults i faced.

As an NSAID, aspirin not only reduces back or neck pain, it also plays a role in containing the inflammation itself. Aspirin works by holding back the production of prostaglandins, short lived chemicals in the body that are responsible for inflammation and pain. Believe it or not, aspirin can have serious side effects, although this is rare for most people. Side effects of aspirin might include stomach problems and cardiovascular events. As with any drug, it pays to be informed about aspirin, including how to store it, when to take it, when to stop taking it and how it works to relieve pain.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I like alieve for all pain except headaches. Depending on your weight and age, start with 2. If that does not work, take 3 but you must wait 12 hours before taking them. They use to be prescription only. They can damage your insides and make you bleed internallly if abused. The max is 4 at once. Dont start with four you may not need them. You cannot have any aspirin in your system, you need to consult with a pharmasist regarding all medications you take so he can make sure there is not problems. Alieve is great, but must be taken very carefully.|`|AA10950898	First of all I would visit a Chiropractor whether you like them or not.

Avanz 30mg take one pill every 12 hours, Trimodal 30mg take one pill twice a day, Soma 350 mg for the severe muscle spasms take one pill four times a day. Duragesic Patches work really well for the severe pain to. Or you can go to the Longs Drug Store and get some Excedrin for back aches to. You can also do the muscle rubs Ben Gay rubs or the back patches and that works to. You should go to your doctor;s office and let them know that you are having severe chronic back pain. I hope that this will help you out and good luck to you. I hope you get better real soon for your pain in your back. I know what you are going through I have a lower back injury and I am having to deal with the severe chronic lower back pain and for the severe chronic lower back muscle spasms to. I have been going from doctors to doctors to find out what is wrong with me and how they can help me out with the severe pain in my lower back to.|`|VNvVhDWgaa	In addition to Sarah's response, i would like to add that besides anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxers, muscle rubs and potential pain medication, and you've seen your doctor and gone through the battery of tests to make sure there's not a broken vertebrae or a slipped/herniated disc or some other thing that can be operated on, you should definitely talk to your doctor about pain management clinics. After asking a similar question myself, i ended up with a couple answers that included going to a pain management clinic. I've been checking things out with one here locally, and they can provide some serious relief for longer periods of times than pills can do, or work with your pill regimen to help keep the pain down to a tolerable level. Be careful with exercises, because they can make things worse, instead of better. Believe me, i've been through about a dozen different physical therapy orders, some for as long as 3-4 months, and sometimes that stuff made it way worse than what it had been before.    Also, be aware that most anti-inflammatory medication can irritate your stomach, so try to eat when you take your meds. DO NOT!!! Follow that other person's suggestion to take up to 4 alieve at a time. DO NOT take that many at a time. 1-2 pills is all you should be taking at a time, at 12 hour intervals, with a maximum of 4 pills in a 24-hour period. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, DO NOT take alieve the way the earlier person recommended. That's a really good way to get a stomach ulcer or have kidney failure fast, not to mention the risk you're taking in just vomiting everything back up.    I have been on 1000 mg of Alieve a day for the last 10 years or so, and only recently did they clear me for another 500 mg each day, so i can take up to 1500 mg of Alieve a day, though i am leery of doing so.

Get evaluated by a Dr. and if your problems are not psychological (and most ED under the age of 40 or so is psychological), then one of the ED drugs should be tried.  Cialis, according to my sources seems to be preferred as it lasts longer and doesn't hit as hard (no joke intended).

He claimed he was able to achieve erection repeatedly every hour from 8 am to 10 pm 7 days a week  by taking "Chinese herbs".Unfortunately he didn't say which ones and I am not  able to believe he or anyone could have sex so frequently..

Try drinking more water & green tea which is rich in antioxidants.    It's simple maths really eat less & move more.   Have a glass of water 20 mins before each meal.   Stay away from takeaway food & eat lots of vegetables & fruits.   Good luck.|`|xR1lBGi4aa	I'm not sure about that but supposedly green tea increases your metabolism.

z70USiQsaa	Ok here's the thing. I was all excited about starting puberty when I was like 12 and was kind of jealous that all the middle eastern kids at my school (no offense intended) were all way bigger and hairier than me in the lockerroom. Then I kind of forgot about it, and that's when it really started to happen. When you don't care anymore, that's when it starts. Also, it happens over such a long period of time that you hardly notice it and when you do notice it you just think of it as normal. It's not like those BS movies you see in school where they wake up with armpit hair and zits. That's total BS. When it finally does happen, you don't think about it too much.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	Usually armpit hair is the first thing to come, even if you don't notice it right away. Facial hair can take all the way into your 20s to come in fully (I know college guys whose beards are finally getting less patchy), so don't look for facial hair as much as other things. Your Adam's apple will get sharper and start to stick out more, that happens pretty early on. Your shoulders and chest start to fill out, too.    I'm not a guy, but I'm an EMT and when we're trying to figure out someone's age, armpit hair is one of the easiest ways to tell if a guy has started puberty. Same with the Adam's apple (kids don't have them). But we don't usually look at the pubic area unless we have to, so I wouldn't know about that.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	If you have not already started puberty - you're getting mighty close.  Hang on tight,   It can be a wild ride.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	Starting puberty isn't like turning on a switch, it happens gradually.  It's when you start to notice things, like getting erections when you don't expect them, hairs just above your penis, and perhaps your top lip, your voice starting to crack, or your penis and testicles starting to grow.  These things don't happen at the same time for everyone, so try not to compare yourself with your friends.  Its a long journey, so just enjoy the ride.  Hope this helps|`|Kk44jgk5aa	Probally not.   Some of the first signs are ussally facial hair, leg hair, armpit hair, ect.  I am 13 and I started when I was 12  I think *scratches head*  LOL  But trust me when you start you probally won't notice since it happens over such a long period of time|`|7UBv8LVEaa	Chinese civilization originated in various city-states along the Yellow River valley in the Neolithic era. The written history of China begins with the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600 BC - ca. 1100 BC). Turtle shells with ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty have been carbon dated to as early as 1500 BC. The origins of Chinese culture, literature and philosophy, developed during the Zhou Dynasty (1122 BC to 256 BC) that followed the Shang. It was the longest lasting dynasty and spans the period in which the written script evolved from ancient oracle script to the beginnings of modern Chinese writing.    The feudal Zhou Dynasty eventually broke apart into individual city states, creating the Warring States period. In 221 BC, Qin Shi Huangdi united the various warring kingdoms and created the first Chinese empire. Successive dynasties in Chinese history developed bureaucratic systems that enabled the Emperor of China to directly control the vast territories.    The conventional view of Chinese history is that of a country alternating between periods of political unity and disunity and occasionally becoming dominated by foreign peoples, most of whom were assimilated into the Han Chinese population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of immigration, expansion, and assimilation, merged to create modern Chinese culture.

The only way to overcome this is to become more comfortable with yourself.  You may not think this is a problem, but it must have something to do with self-confidence. Try being intimate without the need of an erection, such as just laying next to each other or something. Don't try and force it, you'll just get nervous.

I get mine extremely heavy for eight days solid but I also know people who get them very light for only about two days. Everybody's different!    Also trynighttimee pads, even if it's not night they are lifesavers for people with heavy "flows".    You must tell your Mum or a female relative ASAP.

AA12266052	The liver produces urea in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of protein. Normal human adult blood should contain between 7 to 21 mg of urea nitrogen per 100 ml (7-21 mg/dL) of blood. Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges, and this is because the procedure may vary.  An elevated BUN in the setting of a relatively normal creatinine may reflect a physiological response to a relative decrease of blood flow to the kidney (as seen in heart failure or dehydration) without indicating any true injury to the kidney. However, an isolated elevation of BUN may also reflect excessive formation of urea without any compromise to the kidneys.  Increased production of urea is seen in cases of moderate or heavy bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract (e.g. from ulcers). The nitrogenous compounds from the blood are resorbed as they pass through the rest of the GI tract and then broken down to urea by the liver. Enhanced metabolism of proteins will also increase urea production, as may be seen with high protein diets, steroid use, burns, or fevers.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Established hypertension is seldom manageable without medication.

If you are taking blood (phlebotomy) it's important to wear gloves not only because of health standards but because you don't know the patient's history.  All blood is considered hazardous whether it comes from a healthy person or a sick one. Gloves are like a second skin blood can't absorb into your body but It's especially important if you have a cut any where on your hands.

zfd7iriCaa	First, I am sorry that you are feeling like this, especially when finances stand in the way of medical care.    For the insurance issue, the only thing I can recommend is the possibility of Medicaid if you are in the US, which gives medical insurance to people within certain financial guidelines.    As for your health, there are some over-the-counter throat relief options, many of which work.  I realize that you have probably tried all of this if you are at this point, but I'm putting it in just in case.  Also, sage tea can help numb the throat.    Best of luck, I truly hope this works out.|`|568b9f4467fa278aa658b8d4fbbf1a42aa	What a f**king sh!t world we live in when the amount of money you have decides whether you are treated or not, or for that matter whether you live or die, money money money, how fu*king disgusting, thank God for the British health Service, no wonder every sod and his monkey wants to come here.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	If the health insurance issue is because of low income, go to your local Job and Family Services (sometimes called the welfare department) and sign up for Medicaid because you may qualify.  Even if you don't, if you are persistent, they will often give you a list of alternative low cost health insurance.  And, where I live, if you don't qualify for free healthcare, they can still sign you up for one of the state run medical insurances where you would pay a small fee based on income.  I know a woman who has this, and she pays about $30 a month.  It covers exams (as long as the specialist calls ahead), prescriptions (though you might have to pay around $2 per Rx), hospital visits or stays, treatment, or surgery if you need it, and they may even go back and cover your hospital visits for the last three months.    I don't know your situation, so I can't say if you qualify, but it is worth a shot!|`|IDgSVPBxaa	See if your city state county has a free clinic you can go too.

78iBfguoaa	I know you love your mom and you are worried, but there is nothing to worry about. kidney infections can be healed will no ill effects.  just make sure she gets lots of rest and drinks lots of fluids, cranberry juice is good for infections like these. she will be better soon|`|KhmiBbBVaa	If your symptoms are typical and you're generally in good health, antibiotics are the first line of treatment for kidney infection. Which drugs you use and for how long depends on your health condition and the bacteria found in your urine tests.     Drugs commonly recommended for treating kidney infection include:     Amoxicillin (Amoxil, Trimox)   Quinolones such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and norfloxacin (Noroxin)   The antibiotic combination sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim, Septra)   Be sure your doctor is aware of any other medications you're taking or any allergies you have. This will help him or her select the best treatment for you.     Usually, the signs and symptoms of kidney infection begin to clear up within a few days of treatment. But you may need to continue antibiotics for a week or more. Take the entire course of antibiotics recommended by your doctor to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated.     Recurrent and severe infections  Recurrent kidney infections may result from an underlying medical problem, such as a structural abnormality. Your doctor may refer you to a kidney specialist (nephrologist) or urinary surgeon (urologist) for an evaluation to determine if urologic abnormalities may be causing your infections. A structural abnormality may need to be surgically repaired.     For severe kidney infection, hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics may be necessary. When recurrences of kidney infection are frequent or the infection becomes chronic, your doctor will likely recommend that you seek medical care from a specialist who can identify underlying and potentially treatable causes.|`|150esu4Daa	Just relax a kidney infection is easily taken care of with antibiotics, like Cipro. There can be complications, but it sounds like your mom's doctors caught it early and she'll be fine. I'm actually just getting over a kidney infection and I'm five days into my antibiotics and I feel great! Kidney infections are no fun at all, they are painful and can be serious but as long as you get proper treatment you'll be fine. Your mom should be feeling better soon!|`|mAp90hEeaa	People get these all the time and if she takes all of her medication and drinks lots and lots of water, this will all be gone in a little over a week.  You can go to WebMd and read up on urinary tract infections which some people call kidney infections so that when you get one, you will know what to do.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	Chronic sufferer of Kidney Infection and Urinary Tract Infections I'm 29 and have been dealing with this for 4 years now.  Cipro is the most excellent drug for this infection that's what I use all the time.  It works great.  Also cranberry juice is very important, do not let her drink any tea or drinks with caffeine it will make it much much worse.  Another thing is with the pain she may need some Pyridium which can be bought over the counter.  Hope this helps ease your mind.    http://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_infect...|`|bgDMY8I2aa	Yes, a kidney infection can be treated and cured with an antibiotic such as Cipro. Now...sometimes a kidney infection may be caused from what they call 'kidney stones' but even kidney stones can be treated and helped to pass through the urinary tract system or be removed by a doctor. So...rest easy because this is a common infection and nothing to worry about at this point.|`|88YAUVU4aa	Antibiotics are the typical treatment for kidney infection. You can take a number of steps to help prevent a kidney infection in the first place. Drink water , cranberry juice. after intercourse go pee-pee. Do not hold urine in for to long go asap. This should be of some help. Don't worry in most cases everything will go back to normal with no long term damage. God Bless

Try sleleping w/two pillows to help elevate your head so you don't feel as if you are smothering.  Don't watch excitable TV programs or the news before bedtime.

DgX8eVJtaa	Help your friend some information from a reliable source. I know that your hymen, which for many people define as virginity, can be broken in many ways other than sex.     First of all, have your friend discuss with her mother that she doesn't care about the symbolism behind the hymen, and that it makes it very difficult for her to go on with everyday life. Be sure to encourage her to be mature and not get upset when having this discussion.    Secondly, a hymen can be broken through vigorous excercise or simply over time. If your friend is an athlete, such as a cheerleader and exercises a lot, it is very likely that her hymen is already partially, if not totally gone. Encourage your friend and her mother to look into this more.     Just remember to stay supportive of your friend and try not to make a bbig deal about the fact that she has to wear pads. It may be that she is even scared of trying tampons, which, though it may sound silly to those of us who have used them for a while, is very common.    Cheers :)|`|abet6Hvdaa	hell, verginity can only be taken by   HETROSEXUAL intercourse not by a tampon.|`|D0ShtJJJaa	Pfft her mom needs to get a life seriously they are made for the obvious reason not so girls can stick them up there and say their not virgins!  Maybe you should give her some or buy them for her + how is her mom ever going to find out what she has up there? It's your friends business and its not like her mum can look up there!|`|HEb9nQeFaa	If she wears a tampon, she's still a virgin. Her mum is an idiot to be quite honest. Just tell your mate that, and that you can only lose your virginity through penetrative sex. :) Good luck xx|`|YDbyomZ9aa	oh good lord. firstly her mother needs to read the definition of sexual intercourse cause nothing in it mentions a tampon. and secondly, if she's a cheerleader she kinda needs tampons. That could be your counter argument, she can't do a lot of her cheers because of her pad and it makes her feel self conscious when cheering. I know I would.     The mom just really needs to be educated on sex, as weird as that sounds. Or you could just secretly give your friend one when your dressing then have her put a new pad on before she goes home.    Good luck!!|`|hRRsnfglaa	her mom is psycho thats the normal part of bein a woman|`|zLGOQQs5aa	just give her some and keep it a secret from her mom. and for a long time my mom wouldnt let me and one day i stood up to her and told her i already wear them and asked her to buy them for me and at first she said no but now its all good! :) just have to talk to her mom|`|FV0BoSkTaa	Well, if u have your period, you could just loan her some tampons to use for cheerleading.|`|jlQHB9dvaa	Is she friends with your mother?  Maybe she could bring up the subject and talk to her about it.  Since she is a cheerleader, that just seems almost cruel.  How embarrassing for your friend.

Doesn't she realize how this makes her daughter feel?|`|oc0pCUhyaa	YOUR A TEENAGER RIGHT?

Virginity is the the state of never having had sexual intercourse.    Tampons and virginity    A common question asked by young girls and teenage girls is "Am I still a virgin if I wear a tampon?". A virgin is someone who has never had sexual intercourse. Using a tampon will not take away your virginity.    Girls who are virgins usually have a hymen. A hymen is a very thin piece of skin-like tissue that stretches partly across the opening of the vagina. Some virgins do not have a hymen. A girl who is a virgin may have torn her hymen in a way that has nothing to do with having sex. For example, it is a girl may have torn her hymen while horseback riding, falling on a bike, inserting a tampon, strenuous exercise, gymnastics, dancing, and using a menstrual cup.

Being in the smoking area with the non smoking area a few feet away and having a non smoking whiner in my face giving me a hard time.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I am a lifetime non-smoker, but I grew up in a smoking household.   After many years of arguing until I was blue in the face, I realized that the smokers (my parents) simply couldn't smell their own smoke because they were already permeated with it.  In their minds, their smoke hung in a tight little ball around them only, and they just couldn't be made to believe that it stunk up the house, changed the flavor of my food, and caused me to smell like stale cigarettes the moment I put on clean clothes.    It wasn't until after my mom died of cancer (yeah, surprise, right?) that my dad finally quit.  About a year later, he told me that he had gradually regained his senses of taste and smell, and that when people smoke near  him, he's surprised at how strong and acrid it can be.    The sad part is, if you walked into a restaurant and sprayed the most obnoxious french fifi perfume you could find into the air in the smoking section, you'd be the bad guy.|`|XEolRt7Zaa	because they are addicted to it(narcotics)! they don't care 'bout what's the end of it..    i really hate smokers! hmmf! }:-/|`|0k7c35Hraa	millions of things in the world are offensive to somebody. you cant censor people. just ignore it. all you can do is politely ask for them to not smoke around you (if its warranted) like in your house, or around your child. emo kids offend me, but i just think theyre dumb and ignore them. so, just think theyre dumb and ignore them.|`|9CEW093maa	Because most of society (the smokers) would rather feed their addiction than be courteous.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	they realize it they just don't care|`|dthhdHADaa	i think smoking is sexy. but i also think trackers are sexy so what do I know.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Yeah, it's stinky and unhealthy, and a lot of them don't seem to care.

hvCDrY3eaa	I looked up to try and see what could cause it and this is what it said for women they have alot more information on the site.They also explain how infertility is diagnosed. i hope this helped.      -ovulation dysfunction  With this condition, the woman's reproductive system does not produce the proper amounts of hormones necessary to develop, mature, and release a healthy egg.     -anatomical problems  Abnormal development or function of the female anatomy can prevent the egg and the sperm from meeting. The most common anatomical problem is blockage of the fallopian tubes. Other anatomical problems may include the presence of pelvic scar tissue from previous surgeries or infections.     -endometriosis  Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus develops outside the uterus, usually on other reproductive organs inside the pelvis or in the abdominal cavity. Each month, this misplaced tissue responds to the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle by building up and breaking down, resulting in internal bleeding which can cause scar tissue to form and affect reproductive organ function.     -birth defects  Abnormal development and function of reproductive organs resulting from birth defects can affect fertility. One of the most common reproductive system birth defects occurs following a woman's exposure to DES (diethylstilbestrol) taken by her mother during pregnancy. In years past, DES was given to women at risk for pregnancy loss. Fetal DES exposure often causes abnormal development of the uterus and cervix.   infection    -Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by a type of bacteria such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. PID can affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or the ovaries. It can lead to pelvic adhesions and scar tissue that develops between internal organs, causing ongoing pelvic pain and the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy (the fertilized egg becomes implanted outside the uterus).     -immunological problems  A problem with a woman's immune system can lead to pregnancy loss. Antibodies (immune or protective proteins) in a woman's system can fail to recognize a pregnancy, or there may be an abnormal immune response to the pregnancy. Women can also develop antisperm antibodies which attack and destroy sperm.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	delayed onset of sexual activity|`|QsD9VOMYaa	Hormonal issues such as POCS  Infections such as PID which can block the fallopian tube, preventing fertilisation of the egg by the sperm and from going down the fallopian tube to the uterus to implant.

aNwWauXzaa	Jogging in place pales in comparison to real running or even an elliptical or treadmill.  You'd need to be doing it for about an hour straight to get the same benefits of 20 minutes of real running.  Basically, jogging in place for a 500 count is more of a light warm up and won't really get you anywhere.    Rice is good, don't give it up. Diet is the main part of weight loss.  It's all about being in a caloric deficit.  You have to burn off more than you intake.  Go here (calorie calc): http://magnetic-diet.com/calc/daily_calo...  Figure out how many calories you need to stay where you are right now, then cut 500-1000 from that.  That's all you can have every day.  Space this out between 4-6 meals, eating every 3-4 hours.  You can cheat one meal a week, but only one meal and be sure to really cheat when you do or you'll try to make up for it with other meals.  Make a calorie sheet and write down everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, you eat or drink that has calories.  Basically, everything except water.  Make sure it adds up to whatever number you got earlier.  Be sure to recalculate every few weeks as you lose weight.  This will keep you accountable, so that you will not over eat.    If you can go to a gym, start a good weight training program as well.  Every kilo of muscle you gain will burn another ~75 Calories a day, which really adds up.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You aren`t doing very much by jogging in place.

Cdkd4oQ7aa	Yeah, I don't know how common it is, but it's not unnatural or dangerous or anything. No part of anyone's body is perfectly symmetrical. Probably, your right eye needs more light than your left to have the same degree of vision, and therefore under normal circumstances (like, when you check it against the other pupil) it is open more than the other pupil. However, as long as both pupils are round, reactive to light, and not drastically different to the degree that it affects your vision, it's probably not a problem. If it even starts to bother you (like noticeable blurriness, or it won't react to light) you should see an eye doctor.|`|9TyEDcRzaa	this not a common occurrence in normal life and if you are right you must be speaking  about a dangerous situation of your health -- i do not under stand that  your face has half side having any loss of sweating ---it is better for you to a eye surgeon or a neuro Specialist with out loss of time|`|mBlcD6sRaa	yes its normal    but mine is from illegal things

MHcMY2Pfaa	what bite or stung you seriously depends on where you live.  That having been said it sounds like it could be serious, not immediate life threatening or bad things would have already happened but it could easily be infected sub-dermal.

RNWSAItbaa	REM is -- Rapid Eye Movement..    Dreams occur during REM sleep. We typically have 3 to 5 periods of REM sleep per night. They occur at intervals of 1-2 hours and are quite variable in length. An episode of REM sleep may last 5 minutes or over an hour. About 20% of sleep is REM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, perhaps an hour and half of that time, 90 minutes, is REM sleep.     REM sleep is characterized by a number of other features including rapid, low-voltage brain waves detectable on the electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, irregular breathing and heart rate and involuntary muscle jerks.     By contrast, NREM (non-REM) sleep is dreamless sleep. During NREM, the brain waves on the EEG are typically slow and of high voltage, the breathing and heart rate are slow and regular, the blood pressure is low, and the sleeper is relatively still. NREM sleep is divided into 4 stages of increasing depth of sleep leading to REM sleep. About 80% of sleep is NREM sleep. If you sleep 7-8 hours a night, all but maybe an hour and a half is spent in dreamless NREM sleep.|`|ruamFLoiaa	REM means rapid eye movement.

fpIYCkK1aa	Are you prepared? If so, don't worry. If not, become prepared.    Fear of public speaking is as old public speaking.    Act natural, don't be somebody that you are not. The most successfull public speakers are those who can just be themself. And on that topic, be sure to find something in your presentation that you feel passionate about.     There is nothing more pleasant than listening to somebody present somebody they believe in. But conversely, there is nothing worse listening to somebody drone on, wasting everybody's time.    Bottom line. Be prepared, have fun, be passionate and the audience will give you energy to feed off.    Good luck.|`|z3u1f4KAaa	well i suggest you drink about 2-3 monsters or sparks and you wont be scared about the presentation trust me it helps|`|MHcMY2Pfaa	Honestly Public speaking just takes doing it alot to get over the nervousness.

They are prescription only so I'm assuming you dont have any, in which case a small amount of vodka might be your best bet to stomp those butterflies.  The amount you should take depends on your tolerence, you don't want to get TOO drunk and stumble around slurring your words. I find 3 shots to be my magic number whenever i'm about to give a speech ;)|`|ParFJxnSaa	Use what you can from some previous answers: Practice in front of a mirror, declaiming in a fairly loud voice, "for those at the back, and the slightly deaf" and when proficient, repeat it in front of family. Try to start with humor, and, if you can't manage a punchy ending; end with humor. Focus your eyes just above the people in the last row. Arrange well beforehand to be first, or second. Others are bound to be much worse, and by the end, you will have been forgotten.     Consider taking some cooled chamomile tea (no milk, or cream; possibly a little honey & lemon) in an unbreakable container, and drink an hour beforehand. It will relax you somewhat. Check out the tips on the first page, in section 9, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and also:  PUBLIC SPEAKING. ADDRESSING A LARGE AUDIENCE. &     IDEAS ON SPEECHES. SOME IDEAS ON SPEECHES. Visualise yourself, as vividly as possible, making a very good speech; you smile, turn, and leave. Do this after lights out, and again, just prior to speaking.  Some websites: PUBLIC SPEAKING: http://www.uncommonknowledge.com/ & http://www.voicebusiness.com.au/    If you are one of the 40% of people who are fairly suggestible, consider professional hypnotherapy, or: http://www.hypnosisdownloads/  Public Speaking Confidence  Public Speaking Confidence Hypnosis Download or:  http://www.asktheinternettherapist.com/h... Public Speaking  CD - MP3    Consider joining "Toastmasters". Google: " toastmasters; (your city); (your state)"     MORE TIPS: "First, and most importantly, know what you're going to speak about!! If it means having to memorize your speech, then do it. But, the best speeches simply follow an outline, and the speaker knows the topic so well that they can use the outline, and improvise as they go.    Second, don't drink caffeine before your speech. This will make you anxious and agitated, and you're likely to flake out and forget your stuff.    Third, if possible, drink a glass of water with a little lemon juice in it. This is a trick many people use at dinner engagements where they must speak. The lemon-water will help clear your throat and allow you to speak clearly. It actually works well!    Fourth, if eye-contact is a problem, just look at the top of peoples' heads! nobody can tell what you're looking at if you're facing a crowd!    Fifth, if you're using notecards, number them on the top corner. That way, if you drop them, or accidentally shuffle them funny, you can reorganize.    Sixth, take a deep breath right before you begin your speech. it helps. (Do this at home, when practicing, as well; it will psychologically cue you "put you in the zone").    Seventh, know that everyone else in your class has to speak, too, and nobody is going to judge you any worse than they want to be judged!    Most of all, just be prepared, and if you ever lose your place. Stop. Find it. And continue. NEVER APOLOGIZE!!!".

hEFthejvaa	don't get distracted during the evenings. i'm assuming after midnight you just surf on the internet then before you know it it's 3 in the morning. just try to sleep at midnight, you'll be amazed how early you can wake up.  moving your alarm clock across the room helps me a lot. b/c when it rings i'm forced to get OUT of bed to turn it off & by that time i don't feel like sleeping. also having a cup of water next to you helps b/c if you drink it then go back to sleep you'll eventually have to go to the bathroom within minutes.|`|lVvtaBgsaa	Go to sleep at the same time every night. Use an alarm clock to wake up, after a week for so, it should naturally occur.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of very warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 2, 11, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to learn, (progressive muscular relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day.    An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, and pages 2.q, and 2.o, saying to yourself: "Even though I currently have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure. Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective.    Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.    Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea. I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, below, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you.     In section 3 at ezy build: INSOMNIA: PAGE O - INSOMNIA: A COMPREHENSIVE POST a variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing therapy is shown, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from insomnia, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and anxiety. It is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective; although it is easy to be dismissive of such a seemingly unusual technique, give it a good tryout, for at least a few weeks, to see if it is effective in your case. I learned it from a book by a published clinical psychologist, on depression insomnia, and now use it every night, and find it works well.|`|dthhdHADaa	try buying some melatonin at a local vitamin world, it's  something that is already produced in your brain and help creates better sleeping patterns.|`|Ox1Z5eESaa	start sleeping at about half an hour earlier every night until you get to a normal sleeping habit.    your biological clock is stuck at this sleeping rate, so moving back slowly is the best way to change it.
X9QOHRLFaa	hi the truth is only way to effectively and permanently loose weight is by working out and eating right , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call. it really helped me alot , hope it does the same for you    www.xattack.in|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam as suggested by baba Ramdev|`|AA11407914	Diet and intense exercise....................or Surgery :)

GO7mSbxyaa	perhaps you didn't leave the tampon in for long enough this can cause the burning sensation as hadn't absorbed enough leaving parts of the tampon "dry" hope this help    oh and i don't believe you have TSS, as that is very rare|`|HrDL4Njzaa	Its like the tampon gave you rug burn so to speak. You'll be fine. And TSS is caused when you leave the tampon in for a prolonged period of time such as 6 hours.|`|8AoGWNvnaa	TSS is rare.  If you're really concerned about it, see your doctor.    You may have cut yourself inserting the tampon, or the applicator (if there was one) may have had a sharp edge that could have done the same.  The laceration won't take long to heal - when women tear while giving birth, they're stitched up and take (maybe) weeks to heal.  A small laceration as you may have will take days, if that.  I've cut myself before - I was fine the next day.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	no|`|An3TLXUSaa	no you were probably not wet enough inside sometimes that happens to me when i wear a tampon so you are just irritated inside.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Tampons will always cause damage to your vaginal walls because tampons absorb not only menstrual flow but also vaginal fluids, in doing this it dries out the walls of your vagina causing splitting and ulceration  this is made worse if you use commercial tampons such as Tampax as these contain synthetics which are harsh on the vaginal walls. This is also why you are advised never to wear tampons to bed, during light days or when not menstruating as the less menstrual flow then the more of these vaginal fluids a tampon will absorb causing more damage. Whether women notice it or not this always happens when you use a tampon because of how your vagina works and tampons negative effect upon your vagina. Vaginas tend to heal pretty quickly as the mucosa doesnt have the top protective layer as skin does it can get damaged easily but heals easily too, so you should be healed in a few days. If using commercial tampons also bare in mind that you may have a sensitivity to the chemicals within the tampon, that along with friction from removal may have irritated your vagina rather than actually damaged the vaginal walls.    TSS is rare, although something to take very seriously and a real risk from tampon use, if you had TSS then you would likely start to be feeling ill right now as it takes a hold quite fast, needless to say if you had it you would know about it. TSS is totally preventable, you may want to look at menstrual cups or softcups rather than tampons, as well as much safer and cleaner than tampons they are more comfortable, never leak and they can be used up to 12 hours at any time. Otherwise take normal precautions such as changing every 4-6 hours, using lowest absorbency and changing as flow changes, avoid commercial tampons (try organic, cloth, sponge or soft tampons) and alternate between tampons and pads to give your vagina a chance to clean itself and heal after tampon use, don't change tampons too early (for this reason).|`|2IAsQ5l3aa	Oh, you probably take it off to quickly or something like that, but it heals in a matter of a few days, vaginal tissue is very special and it is also strong enough and it gets regenerated so rapid, is nothing big, just try to be hygienic enough so it does not get infected, so you don't want that make like a major thing, you know, but if the pain persists longer than a week and the pain gets worse i think you should probably see a doctor, well i don't think it hurts a lot, but if it does, you can use lydocaine to ease the pain, it is an anesthetic and you can get it at the pharmacy, not sure if you need a prescription for it, i don't think so, but i don't think you'll use it...    Get well better soon, and be gentle the next time.    God bless you

If you have questions make sure you ask, sometimes doctors can be busy and hurry through an appointment, but that's your time so use it.    Everyone has explained the procedure so there's no point in me repeating it, but let your doctor know its your first time and ask if he/she can explain everything to you beforehand.  A good doctor will make you as comfortable as possible.  You might feel a slight discomfort or pinch during the exam, which is normal and you may be uncomfortable for a little while afterward.      You'll be fine, just breath deep and relax.  The more relaxed your body is the easier it'll be for you.  Good luck!|`|7kopRjIwaa	Pretty much what everyone else said, I skipped mine for like 5 years and finally went, I was really freaked out but it was so much easier that expected, I shaved (because I usually do) and wore a skirt and knee high socks which I was allowed to wear both :) (just ask to keep them on if they ask you to undress) and bring ipod to listen to co relax!|`|AA12266052	The Pap smear is done as part of a gynecological exam. You will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups to position your pelvis for examination. The health care provider will insert an instrument (speculum) into your vagina and open it slightly to see inside the vaginal canal.  The health care provider will take a sample of cells from the outside and the canal of the cervix by gently scraping the outside of the cervix with a wooden or plastic spatula, then inserting a small brush that looks like a pipe cleaner into the canal.  The cells are placed on a glass slide, or put in a bottle containing a preservative, and then sent to the lab for examination.|`|ruamFLoiaa	Shaving isn't important.  Cleanliness, I am sure is appreciated but just bathing should take care of that.  It isn't a huge deal.  It can feel a little cold, there can be a little pain during the test and slight bleeding afterward but it isn't a long drawn out procedure.  Try to relax as much as you can because it will make it easier.

LXLf3Jl6aa	I've personally found that the best crash course is to start at a reasonable number that gets your heart pumped and simply add one or two reps to the amount you've determined each time you workout. For example, on the first day I might do 3 sets of 20 push ups, 30 sit ups, and run a mile (morning, afternoon, and evening). Two days later I might do 3 sets of 22 push ups, 33 sit ups, and run a mile. Up your reps by a regular amount and try to stick to it as much as possible. Drink tons of water (good for building muscle and for burning fat) and try to eat 3 meals of about 500 calories each. If you stick to it for even a month I think  you'll be surprised at what an hour a day can do. Once you find yourself in passing ranges like a 180 or better, start over again wearing a backpack with 20 pounds of hardcover books in it =).

YzhYFu0eaa	Depends on the gym you go to.  Unless you're getting a discount, it can cost up to $200 because they charge a membership fee and a load of crap fee called a "transaction fee."  Plus, they'll try to suck you for every dime after that by talking you up on supplements, setting you up with a trainer, signing you up for classes, and selling you clothing and junk you don't need and can buy cheaper at regular stores.     After all that, they'll charge you your first and last month when you join, and that can be anywhere from $10-30 a month.|`|4htyTXJSaa	29.99 a month  i go to La fitness|`|eDykHvX1aa	anywhere from 29-500 a month
AA11614449	Petachiae is caused by a minor break in the capillary vessels.  The most common cause of petechiae is through physical trauma, so it could be due to your scratching. However, petechiae may be a sign of thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), in circumstances when platelet function is inhibited or in clotting factor deficiencies.  They may also occur when excessive pressure is applied.      You could have a dermatologist check it out if want to fully ease your fears.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Have you started using any different products?   Soap?  Washing powder?   Sunblock?

I would ask your doctor...|`|mAp90hEeaa	People find all different things that will get rid of this.  Some people use the old fashioned lemon drops which they say helps, others use hard peppermint candies.  Other people find certain foods that may get rid of this taste.  Until you finish your chemo, this will probably persist.  It is a trial and error thing because what works for one person does not work for another.|`|NLx6mCJGaa	Most likely you will have that taste during the course of treatment and sometime afterward.    There is no way to get rid of it but you can try masking it a little.  Your radiation oncologist should have strong flavored hard candies available for during or after treatment, but be careful with the hard candy if you develop mouth sores.  Hard candy or food will add to mouth sore pain so should be avoided if you get mouth sores.    What helped me most was avoiding using metal when possible and using only plastic utensils, and also using Biotene mouthwash (no harsh mouthwashes), avoiding sugar, beef, and salts.  Some foods I had loved tasted like pure salt while that metal taste was present.  All my food tasted different during treatment, some to the point of not being able to stomach it.  It will be different for everyone, but eggs, yogurt, potatoes, and oatmeal retained their most original flavor during treatment.  Take quick action for mouth and upper GI sores, which seem to progressively increase as the metallic taste progressively increases.    One can't get rid of the metallic taste or even mask it much, but it will go away eventually.    Good luck to you.
AA11020187	The fact your grandfather had lung cancer is not a determining factor as to whether or not you will get lung cancer. It is also very rare to see anyone with lung cancer in their 20s. The radiologist should have been able to tell by the CT if this is, or at least suspicious for, metastatic disease|`|mAp90hEeaa	I wouldn't be jumping into the worst case scenarios just yet.  This could all be related to the compression fracture and taking an anti-inflammatory regularly may help with any discomfort.  Compression fractures can also come from lifting something heavy and it doesn't have to be extremely heavy.  I know because I have done this and have been diagnosed with a comminuted compression fracture of the spine.  And, I am female and have no osteoporosis.  Wait for the results and at your age, this will probably all be related to the back problem.  If you want it healed up properly and not give you problems down the road, take the medications as directed (I took them for at least 9 months), do the physical therapy (I had heat, ultrasound and gentle stretching movements) and do all the exercises then recommended at home until you become pain free which can take months.  Today, I am pain free and do heavy lifting on a regular basis.|`|9ImRzgckaa	I know this answer is extremely short but it is extremely important ............. get a second opinion !!|`|dvlq8Sp8aa	Unless you haven't been diagnosed with cancer already I would not worry about it being Metatstic cancer.  Most likely you would have had symptoms which would have given you a diagnosis of cancer in your body already.  I agree with the others..

tEpPgjSFaa	Weight Watchers is not about maximums, but minimums. The program clearly stresses the importance of eating your minimum point value. Many diet programs have an opposite approach in which they stress that you do not go over your maximum allowed calories.     Now, that is not saying that Weight Watchers is not about maximums as well. While they stress the importance of not eating too little, it is also important not to eat more than your daily allowed points and weekly allowance points. They understand the importance of balance. If you eat too much, you will not lose any weight, but if you eat too little your body will go into starvation mode which will prevent you from losing the weight.    My friend has done Weight Watchers successfully at home, but once he lost the weight, he went off the program and gained back more than what he lost. Now, we are both doing the program by attending meetings and we are doing great. I have tried to do the program on my own, but until I started attending meetings I have not been able to keep up.    Did you know that those who attend meetings tend to lose an average of 3 times more weight than those doing Weight Watchers on their own?    Another concern I would have about you using materials at home is the program has changed in the past couple of months. While the system for calculating point values of food (the Points Slider) is the same, the overall program has changed to the new Momentum Program. This program, also called "Flore" by some, combines the best of both the Core and Flex programs. You are required to keep track of your points by measuring portion sizes and tracking while focusing on filling foods ("core" foods) that will help you from getting hungry right after you eat.     Depending on how old the materials you have are, you may not have the updated formula for calculating your personal daily points. The older programs base your daily points allowance on your weight alone. The new programs take in account your weight, gender, age, and activity level. This allows you a more customized plan that better suits your lifestyle.    If you want to go this alone, it is possible, but it may prove to be more challenging. Try to find out what your daily points allowance on the new program is, and focus on eating more "core" foods. Don't forget to get at least thirty minutes of physical activity on most days of the week.

1ViGcF3xaa	Hi meep meep!    Wow, there's so many things that could cause this!  My weight goes up and down about 5 pounds every week depending on how much and what I've eaten, how much exercise I do or don't do, how often I've pooped, what I've drank, stress, etc.  I've heard that woman can have rapid weight change by using birth control and it being that time of month too.  If you've gone to the Doctor and he doesn't seem very worried about it then neither would I.  Just stop weighing yourself and causing yourself to worry, Lol.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Hey, meep meep. :)    My weight fluctuates within five pounds depending on what time of the month it is.  Us chicks with our water weight...there are times I'm retaining more water than the Hoover Dam. :(  I think this is pretty normal and, like Beatle said, hormonal forms of birth control can always be a factor.     I would become concerned if you start to continually lose or gain a large amount of weight, with no movement back in the opposite direction...if you do, just let your doctor know.  And if you keep up with the vitamin, try taking it with food...I've never been able to take those on an empty stomach.|`|uNlbvD5vaa	Did you have your thyroid tested? Also hormones can be a big part of it.  Stress?  I am going through the same thing as we speak.  My doctor and Psychiatrist say its stress, even though I don't feel stressed, my body/brain might be.

kXq90b09aa	Most of the scales and calculators do not show very accurate body fat levels but there are highly technical methods like Hydrostatic weighing, unfortunately these methods aren't commonly available for us! Body Mass Indicator is the most reliable way to determine how healthy we weigh! Your body mass index is 23 which is very good.     To increase or decrease your percent of body fat you need to create the right balance between the calories in and calories out. The best way to do this is to decrease daily calories by about 500 and increase your exercise. Interval Training along with strength training would be an ideal workout plan to burn fat!    Oh and yea, The average adult body fat for a male should be between 15 to 18%.     Good Luck!
N9MoXl7Naa	There shouldn't be any difference in the vaccines between the private sector and the public program.  You could also contact the program sponsor--most likely the Rotary Club--and see how soon the next session will be.    Since you have access to a private doctor you might want to ask about the Polio shots--which are the killed virus (Salk) vaccine. I had both--after I had Polio in 1953 before they were available.    Here in the U.S. they are using the Salk vaccine only because of the very tiny chance of infection with the oral vaccine. In other countries the oral vaccine is still preferred because of transport and storage issues.|`|jsxQRnLsaa	Sara B gave you a very good answer.  If at all possible go to the private sector and try to get the shot and not the live vaccine that is in the drops!

xnjnC8Wiaa	As someone else just pointed out, about 7 hours is the norm for most people.  It does also depend on what you've been doing that day as well as to how much rest you should get and how much sleep you'd normally have.    There are times when I've slept just a couple of hours and felt better than when I've been asleep for 8 or more hours, so it will more than likely vary from person to person.    Why not try out different time-tables and see which works best for you?  Perhaps just altering when you go to bed or get up could make a big difference in the level of rest you actually get.|`|171b862a18e6a8061d053088188f949faa	It varies depending on your personal needs|`|982f2da475e8bb55ef16be73049cd9a6aa	The general rule of thumb is no less than 6hrs and no more than 8hrs a night.

See how much you need & don't ask the others. Sleep 2-4 days as much as you can and see how you feel. Everyday feeling better or tired? Then 4 another days in row put your alarm to wake you up in 8 hours and see again how you feel.   Usually they say 5-8 hours is fine. But some people sleep the afternoon too. You can sleep 6 hours the night and then 2 the morning it's the same. For example i'm a student too and i know i don't have time at all and the most of times i'm sleeping late the night. But to be truth i'm a big sleeper myself. I could leave myself sleeping 12 hours+ altough i feel tired then. I can't get up, i can't concentrate etc... But when i sleep less (6-7 hours) i wake up really fast *next day* and i'm full of energy and i can't explain that(!)!!  So it depends on the situation, the person, the DNA sometimes...

bedcd669e5bc14cae6de4e6eac6f03b0aa	I have tattoo's and use sunscreen on them before going into the tanning beds.  I have not had any problems.  I am not sure if that is "okay" or not. It has helped keep my tat's from getting as much UV rays as the rest of my body - they stay whiteish but you sweat a lot so it comes off a lot too.  I think the protection is there but comes off a bit while you are in there.     I used 25+ spf sport.|`|hBFSQ9bbaa	yes!  the answer is yes, use sunscreen before going into the tanning bed.  please don't use it on JUST your shoulders tho.  : )  uv screws with your dna.  it actually crosses your T's for you lol but thats a dorky science joke.  and please eat cereal after you go or take so folic acid supplement.  : )  ~ it depletes your folate stores and thats something your body doesnt make on its own.  you have to get it through food.
5d0ddeee2dd02efdbd61b6fc7bd9da2baa	Hiya,    As a yoga teacher I would say yes because often your hands can slip on carpet in any postures which require you to take your weight onto your hands/feet etc.  You can pick up a yoga mat which is more than suitable for pilates for about a 5 if you are really strapped for cash.    I would try the pilates first and see how much you need to do that you may slip on the carpet doing before you set out to buy one though as you don't want to end up with a mat you may not use as you don't really get into the pilates.    Good luck and have fun|`|10889e5560ba7c0f6a7ffab120908df1aa	No you don't but certainly is more comfortable....|`|AA10135406	no|`|AA12399676	C'mon!|`|POStrmhKaa	no you don't have to but it is a great deal more comfortable    you may also want to try brining a towl instead, or a bathroom mat that may stick to the floor better?|`|J7u63BJUaa	I never used one.  I also do pilates on a carpet.  Just make sure your t-shirt is not too loose, it can ride up and give you carpet burn.  Believe me I know.    Good luck, it's a lot of fun!
s57vwCRoaa	dont make your vision worse purposely. try getting glasses that dont help your vision or do anything, if you want glasses.|`|40ZdU24Iaa	I'm sure you don't need someone telling you thats a bad idea to screw with your gift of good vision.     Just ask your parents, they probably will laugh a little and then just let you get them. But if that happens, be prepared to pay for them yourself, about $200 (unless you're spoiled, of course). Insurance most likely won't pay for you to get glasses you don't need. Good luck.
ab6c493f91ee96628f1337c9e7d2bfcdaa	i think its great that ur helping her. tell her to eat LOTS and LOTS or fruit. Fruit is sweet but the healthy kind of sweet. and tell her to eat in healthy small portions every 2-3 hrs. stock up on veggies too! for exercising, maybe an hour a week. or 20 minutes a day. do lots of weight lifting. i would suggest to sumtimes exercise with her so she has sum support. good luck to her!|`|s57vwCRoaa	yup. first, eat right as much as possible.. with healthy foods. then, try exercising by jogging, bide riding, playing sports, and just moving her body. you girls can do it together. jump roping is also very good for you..|`|nPqQTXkmaa	Well I wouldn't offer her help unless she asks for it.

I've been trying to convince my older brother to get in better shape for at least 7 years and he has very little interest in it.      But if you are creative, just make sure she's never sitting down.  Keep her active and don't let her eat junk like most kids eat.  Soda = horrible.  Water, fruits, veggies, healthy proteins.  You are probably most in control of the exercise portion.

Both of your bodies are changing, and most people are heavier at that age than they will grow up to be.  So.   Don't insult her, or she will be blinded to your message.  If you really want to help her you could find an activity for the two of you to participate in together, like dancing or swimming lessons.    Anything can be used as an opportunity to be active, even going to the mall.  All that walking around.  You could also consider learning to cook together, and focusing on healthy meals.  You will be learning to stay healthy, and to help out at dinner time.  Good luck!

By2HAU85aa	The only way to burn fat from your abdominal area is cardiovascular exercise. Walk, run , jog, bike...get your heart rate above 125 for an extended period of time..30 minutes or so.

You must decrease your overall body fat content.

(ie// situps will give you stomach muscle, but  you have to reduce the flab to see them)|`|aadbc672ff509652b97f6931f5913dbaaa	Are you thinking of doing 500 pushups in one day? All at once or spaced out over the day.? Does not matter if it is true or not coz I doubt you could do them. If you could you would be pretty fit and into that stuff and know the answer.  Push ups can involve the abdominals, most weight bearing activity does, so long as you engage those muscles during the exercise. Your muscle tone will improve but it will not make your tummy flat. Instead you will have good muscle tone hiding under a layer of flab so make sure you eat well and include cardio in your work out plan.  Weight training (push ups included) should not be done everyday. 2 or 3 times per week with at least one days rest between is more than enough.    My answer remains the same but in light of the fact you meant sit ups then do more than just sit ups.Instead do crunches, twist crunches, reverse crunches, hip flexion, plank etc. Variety will mean you will work the abs and the obliques, it will also stop you from getting bored with your workout.|`|LRRWuu4Vaa	yes,500 push ups can make your stomach flat if you can do that everyday.better ask those soldiers who always do that every mistake they make.good luck.|`|htgLCQ9Paa	what the ****. where did u ******* hear that from. whoever the **** told you that **** need to ******* die. that is all bullshit and u will get **** accomplished on your abs if you do that ****. who the **** told you that. that ************ needs to ******* die. o when i get my ****** up hands on that person, i will strangle the **** outta that *****. no its not ******* true.    whoever the **** told you that needs to suck a dick

AkVIG7Vfaa	I am a 41-yr old mother of 3 and was finally diagnosed with Endo via Lap 12 years ago, although I've suffered with the symptoms for thirty years.  I've had 5 laporoscopies to both surgically remove and cauturize the sites (surgical removal is more effective).  Note: everytime they go in to get some endo growth out, its very possible that the tools transfer endo cells to a new site. Limit the   of Laps.    I tried the Lupron injections that put you into a menapausal state, meant to reduce the endo growths "to ground zero", but when I came off the Lupron (you have to after 6-months due to bone loss) the endo was back in full swing, but this time with a twist:  when menstrating I swelled up like I was seven or eight months pregnant, resulting in my first of eight abdominal hernias.      After going to the Endometriosis Association Conference in Milwalkee (every 5 years) I learned about CONTINUOUS low-dose Birth Control (Lo-ovral was the right match for me).  What I mean by continuous is that you don't take the placebos so you never menstrate.  Oh how I wish I wish I wish someone had told me about this years ago.  Only come off the pills when/if you want to conceive -- this way you save your body from making all those endo growths, for all those other months, over all those years.  If I had a daughter I'd tell her to take continuous low-dose BC until she wants to have a baby, thats what the doctors who believe in continuous BCP are doing with their daughters. Menstration is just a prep for pregnancy.    My doctors here in NJ are both unfamiliar with and uncomfortable about CONTINUOUS BIRTH CONTROL PILLS so they wanted me to come off every 5 or 6 months.  Whenever I did that, my abdomen swelled up enormously again which is how I got more hernias.  Note: every abdominal surgery creates scar tissue and adhesions, which are wonderful little places for endo material to get trapped and grow.     This Spring, after a particularly rough bout with endo and swelling, my belly never got normal again even when I went back on the BC pills.  Last week I had a radical hysterectomy, removing my uterus, cervix, both fallopian tubes, both ovaries, appendix, endo growths, debridement of scar tissue and adhesions, and repair of four abdominal hernias.  There will be no more endo growth, however, if they did not nick it all off my bowels (where I most tend to grow it) I may still have some endo pain, I've read.  But at least I won't be swelling up anymore!    As I've indicated, if I had to do it over again I would have done CONTINUOUS low-dose BCP and prevented menstration -- all year round.  I think science is on the brink of accepting this method: that women do not need to menstrate at all until they wish to conceive -- and only then.    Long winded (sorry) but a long history.   Hope it helps someone somehow.|`|AA10587091	I have been diagnosed as well. As far as treatment there is very little they can do, surgery is usually the only option to remove the fibers that cause it. However surgery is not a permanent solution, in some cases multiple surgeries were performed to remove the fibers. Be cautious though the more surgery you have the less chances you have of being able to have children. Some people say that birth control pills help the pain of your monthly, I have used them but generally they have no effect.

Another way is that (I read it from female magazine) is that you squeeze some cucumber juice, mix it with water and drop into your eyes. This is better than eye drops that you buy from pharmacy.

zC0XLym5aa	Do Crunches. Lie on the floor (with or without a mat). Cross your arms in front of your chest. (Donot place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative to crossing your arms in front of your chest is to lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat.     Do Sit Ups. Lie on the floor, feet on the floor, knees up and hands behind your head or crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades. Lower yourself down. Repeat. Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench or do these on an exercise ball. Once you "graduate" from that, do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights. You might also try lifting your feet off the ground while doing the sit ups or alternating the leg in the air, like pretending to pedal while sitting up. If your hands are behind your head, bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow and then your right knee to the left elbow.   Do Leg Lifts. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a ninety degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar. Still too easy?...   Do Jackknife Sit Ups. Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it. What's that? More?   Do V-ups. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands on the floor but this time extended out over your head. Simultaneously raise legs and torso. Don't bend your knees! What kind of V would it be if you bend your knees? Reach with your hands toward the raised feet. Touch your feet if possible (might require some flexibility). Relax, return to starting position and repeat. Add weight between feet to match your taste.   Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and you whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non-weight bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long as possible   Train Your Oblique Muscles. It's not as important to work on your oblique muscles at first, but eventually you'll want to start working these too. These are the muscles to either side of your stomach. There are multiple ways to do this and anything that includes twisting your torso against a resistance counts. There are twisting machines at gyms, you can twist while you do sit-ups, you can do side bends, you can twist side to side with a medicine ball in hand, etc. Be aware though, that many beginners tend to have weak obliques compared to their abs (it simply isn't used as much in daily life) so go easy on the sides at first.   Other stuff Since it is, literally, the center of your body there are many other tricks you can use to train your abs, and some of the other movements will more or less involve your abs. Including every abdominal exercise in existence would make this article painfully long and new methods are being developed constantly.

MXeinNM8aa	Small, unbroken blisters [less than 1 in. (2.5 cm) across] usually heal on their own.  Do not try to break the blisters. Just leave them alone.  Do not cover the blisters unless something such as clothing is rubbing against them.   Avoid wearing clothes or shoes or doing activities that rub or irritate the blisters until they have healed.    Watch for a skin infection while your blister is healing. Signs of infection include:    Increased pain, swelling, redness, or warmth around the blister.  Red streaks extending away from the blister.  Drainage of pus from the blister.  Swollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpit, or groin.  Fever.|`|AA11403376	Natural aloe vera gel.

viKFlck5aa	Il punto non  se la red bull  buona o no...il problema  che sempre pi spesso la si ordina al bar come una normalissima bibita e il pi delle voltel a si associa all'alcool senza sapere i rischi ai quali incorre l'organismo. tempo fa mi  arrivata una mail nella quale sono descritte varie conseguenze in cui pu incorrere un bevitore di red bull...l RED BULL f creato per stimolare il cervello delle persone sottoposte ad un grande sforzo fisico (stress) e mai per essere consumato come una bibita rinfrescante.    RED BULL E UNA BIBITA VITALIZZANTE  che si commercializza a livello mondiale cos:    Aumenta la resistenza fisica, aiuta la capacit di concentrazione e la velocit di reagire, apporta pi energia e migliora lo stato danimo emotivo (apparentemente, ma in realt). Tutto questo si pu trovare in una lattina di RED BULL, la bibita energetica del millennio..!     Red Bull  riuscita a penetrare in quasi 100 paesi di tutto il mondo. La marca del TORO ROSSO ha come clienti sopratutto giovani e sportivi, due segmenti attrattivi per stimulare la causa della bibita.    VEDIAMO LA VERITA DI QUESTA BIBITA    La FRANCIA e la DINAMARCA le hanno proibite per essere un cocktail della morte, che occasionano i suoi componenti di vitamina mescolati con " GLUCURONOLACTONE", chmico altamente pericoloso, che fu sviluppato dal Dipartimento della Difesa degli Stati Uniti negli anni 60 per le loro truppe in VIETNAM, inquanto attuava come una droga allucinogena che attenuava lo stress della guerra. Ma i suoi effetti nellorganismo furono tanto devastanti che si abbandon la somministrazione davanti ad un alto indice di dolori di testa, tumori cerebrali e malattie del fegato, che mostravano alcuni soldati che ne facevano uso.    E, dopo tutto questo, sulla lattina di RED BULL ancora si legge che fra i suoi componenti c il GLUCURONOLACTONE, catalogato medicamente come uno stimolante. Ma quello che non dice la lattina di RED BULL sono le consequenze del suo consumo, che obbligano a collocare una serie di AVVERTIMENTI:    1. E pericoloso berlo se subito dopo non fai attivit fisica, visto che la sua funzione rivitalizzante accellera il ritmo cardiaco e pu causarti un infarto fulminante!    2. Corri il pericolo di una emorragia cerebrale, dovuto a che il RED BULL contiene componenti che fanno diluire il sangue affinch il cuore possa pompare senza molti sforzi, e puoi cos fare uno sforzo fisico con meno affaticamento.    3. E proibito mescolare il RED BULL con alcool, perch la mescola si converte in una "Bomba Mortale" che attacca direttamente il fegato, provocando in questo modo un effetto tale che la zona colpita non si rigenera pi.    4. Uno dei componenti principali del RED BULL  la vitamina B12, utilizzata nella medicina per recuperare pazienti che si trovano in uno stato di coma etilico; da qui la ipertensione e lo stato di eccitazione che ti trovi dopo averla presa.    5. Il consumo regulare del RED BULL innesta la apparizione di una serie di malattie nervose e neurologiche IRREVERSIBILI.    CONCLUSIONE: E una bevanda che dovrebbe essere proibita, come gi lo stanno facendo alcuni paesi.  Cercate su Internet altri studi di questa pericolosa bibita.|`|0e09798d0cb8f1ef63a5e17e540ea303aa	NON BEVO SPERMA DI TORO!|`|Hg57E43Daa	 buonissima ! ti da un sacco di energia , non per niente  un energy drink.

WS4Iu6xNaa	6lbs of fat, would be the size of a new born baby (a big jello  of fat)  You are already doing what you can to lose fat, and your body is going the speed it should be. Do you have a healthy diet?    http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/cal...  8 Ways to Speed Up Your Metabolism  "  Eat little and often - there's evidence that eating small, regular meals throughout the day, rather than one or two large meals, may help to keep your metabolism ticking over. Surprisingly, around 10 percent of the calories we use each day go on digesting and absorbing food - so the more times you eat, the greater this effect is likely to be.       Eat plenty of protein-rich foods - research shows that around 25 percent of calories in a protein-rich meal may be burnt off. But make sure you choose low-fat protein foods such as lean meat, skinless chicken and low-fat dairy products."|`|y6gVmhHxaa	It is impossible to lose 6 lbs of fat in 10 days.

If your weight has been stable for a while while keeping to the diet, you should have a good idea what calorie level you need to maintain.    Yeah, you can eat whatever you want, as long as you don't go over. It's a lot easier to stay under your calorie budget if you stick to veggies and other low-fat foods, though. A couple of cups of veggies will be way more filling than a scoop of ice cream, even though the ice cream has more calories.|`|Cy6Dxmg3aa	maybe.thats the amount of calories we're supposed to have daily anyways|`|JU3OwbD5aa	You can but its not very good for you.  After all one meal at McDonalds is atleast 1200 calories and you need more food than that or your metabolism will slow down.    Also keep in mind you can probably eat more than 1200 calories without gaining weight.  Multiply 12 by your bodyweight and thats the amount of calories you need to maintain your weight.    You can relax the diet some but don't go overboard.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	If you keep your calorie intake to 1200 calories a day, you won't gain weight even if it's all junk food, but it wouldn't be a healthy diet.  Remember it wouldn't take much junk food to add up to 1200 calories, so don't get carried away. Forget the word diet and eat  well balanced meals and allow yourself a treat once in a while. And congratulations on reaching your goal.|`|tEZXqCdQaa	Congrats on your accompishments! Everyone has different caloric requirements in order to loose, gain, or maintain depending on your height/weight/amount of daily excercise, etc.     I think in order to maintain what you accomplished, you should still be conscious about the food that you are puting into your body. Weight loss may be attributed to dieting..but maintainance is attributed to a LIFESTYLE change..    This doesnt mean you have to always eat "diet foods" and that you can never eat a cookie or some ice cream because deprivation will only lead to binge eating..which is never good. If its a special occasion, eat what you want.. just be conscious and stop eating when your body tells you thats your full... they key to maintaince is moderation...try to eat (and enjoy!) healthful food for 75% of the time and eat what you want the other 25%. If you eat "whatever you want" all the time.. be prepared to gain the weight back that im sure you worked SO hard to loose!    Also, remember to work out often. Personally,I do about an hour of cardio 5 days a week and weights 3 days a week. A healthful diet, moderation when your not healthful, and staying active should let you maintain what you've worked so hard to accompish!    Good Luck!..and remember...feeling good about yourself, and having the energy that you will feel by living a healthy lifestyle tastes better than anything you could ever eat!

AubmEoYgaa	As long as you get the same amount of sleep every night, anywhere between 6 and 8 hours is great. Make sure you turn off all lights, stereos,TVs, Computer and just block out all noises that you possibly can. Uninterrupted sleep is the best and you should wake up fresh and revitalized. Get up as soon as you wake up, don't lay and take another five or ten more minutes. If you use an alarm, set it far enough away from you that you have to get up to turn it off. Go downstairs and eat a hardy breakfast like eggs. No sweets like in cereal. Drink some milk and when finished go directly up to take a shower. While in the shower, take your fingers and just scratch like all over your head, this will will give you energy. After you shower and the water drains out, re-plug the tub, (If you have a shower in-cased around a regular bath tub). fill the tub with cold water about as high as your ankles, get in and walk back and forth through the cold water, which will also revitalize you. Stay away from sugary drinks and foods and eat more fruits and vegetables. Eggs are loaded with protein. I buy Egg-lands Best, all ingredients are lower, like cholesterol. Sleep doesn't make you feel revitalized, it's exercise and the things I told you about that will do the trick. Wishing you the very best young lady and good luck on some really really revitalized days.|`|3hkx6r9Taa	The key to waking up and feeling good can be traced to many things like exercise, good diet, getting rid of caffeine and more, however if it's just a sleep pattern you are after then consistency is the key. The best way to wake up and be ready to face the day is to sleep at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every day. If you have a job that doesn't allow you to sleep at night, darken or cover your windows because there are reactions your body has to sunlight, even when filtered through your closed eyelids that lower the quality of sleep. 7 hours is recommended and it will take a few weeks before your body is used to it and responds with improved energy and focus but after that it will be smooth sailing as long as you keep it up.|`|cLrkXn6gaa	Studies have shown that people who sleep during the night time actually get better sleep. Going to be around 10 and waking up at about 6 is supposed to be the perfect sleep schedule. My advice is to try to remain constant always go to be and wakeup around the same time. And try to get at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. Any thing less then 7 is not enough sleep and anything more than 9 can actually make you wake up feeling like you need more sleep.
AA10725882	From http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/45...    "Fifty years ago, with surgery alone, the survival rate 2 years after nephrectomy was 20%. The introduction of adjuvant radiation raised the survival rate to 50% overall. Due to the cooperative efforts of oncologists, surgeons, and pathologists and with the introduction of chemotherapy with vincristine, dactinomycin (actinomycin D), and doxorubicin, the overall survival (OS) rate has risen to 90% in the last 30 years."

However that's only about half of the muscle groups you have. It will also be great for cardio but if you want a total body workout, the best thing to do is train all of your muscles. If by skinny you mean you are a hardgainer or someone who has trouble adding weight to their frame, the best way for you to put on weight is to eat a lot of good food and train heavy. You are not going to put on a lot of weight if you do a lot of cardio with low resistance. You need heavy weight and about twice the calories your body needs or more. And skip cardio for a month at a time to help you pack on the lbs. You can always run every other month for good cardiovascular health, which is important, but cardio everyday will cut your gains considerably.|`|aNwWauXzaa	Not by itself.

AA12266052	Inhalation of butane can cause euphoria, drowsiness, narcosis, asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia, and frostbite which can result in death from asphyxiation and ventricular fibrillation. Butane is the most commonly misused volatile substance in the UK, and was the cause of 52% of "solvent related" deaths in 2000. By spraying butane directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to 20 C by expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm. "Sudden sniffer's death" syndrome, first described by Bass in 1970, is the most common single cause of "solvent related" death, resulting in 55% of known fatal cases.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Cancer will not start to grow until the correct conditions are there.

The pus, by squeezing can and will go into the fascia (skin layers) and stay there until it's ready to travel, yes, it has a mind of it's own. I know for a fact he didn't get it all out. From there it can travel to other parts of the body and incubate there creating a infection he doesn't want to think about like MRSA. Or, even the flesh eating bacteria.

He should go to the Dr and have it checked just in case he has Staph or MRSA....It sounds like dried blood coming out of it. Keep it clean and dry and quit poking at it.I had one of those once and it went away. All i had to do was keep it clean and dry. That is a tough place to keep dry...so he may have to use a light colored peice of cloth to cover it when just sitting around,so it does not pick up bacteria. Good Luck.

Cut up a tomato and apply it all over your face. Tomato contains lycopene, which is one of the most powerful natural antioxidants and tomato are rich in vitamin C and contain appreciable amounts of vitamins A and B, potassium, iron, and phosphorus.  So put the sliced tomato on you facial areas and leave it for a 15 to 20 minutes. Keep yourself relax in the meantime. After washing your face you will notice a fresh sensation while touching your skin. This is because the tomato has help to quickly refresh your acne skin areas.|`|oPq1yAKRaa	well i was going to say proactive, i swear by it now nothing else i have used has compared to it.

xYTagSIyaa	It is not only normal but common to get muscle cramping and pain with either a potassium or a calcium deficiency.  These pains usually are first noticed in cramps in the calfs and feet.  Since you are getting the pains in your shoulder and back I would say it is not likely due to a deficiency but probably a strain.  Could it be your purse or the way you carry it?  Are you carrying heavy groceries or exercising it in some other way?|`|jSBtdhf0aa	it can and it is very hard on the heart also to high potassium can actually cause the heart to stop, resulting incertain death.|`|285cdf0f42a5ad1b82e6756c69e8c768aa	I'm not sure - however, too low a potassium level can cause dizziness, etc. Eat bananas, drink orange juice, that should help.

Potassium also affects high blood pressure and stroke. When potassium levels are low in some people with salt sensitivity, their blood pressure spikes in response to eating salt, but may remain steady when potassium levels are high.|`|GqTSa85daa	It causes leg cramps for me, usually when I'm sleeping.

I take potassium supplements twice daily. You need to tell your Dr about the pain. i get pains and severe muscle cramps in my stomach and legs and back when I am low on Potassium. I have mine checked monthly because I am on a diet. Too little potassium or too much potassium may cause cardiac problems as well. It is nothing to take lightly but can be remedied easily. Therre are lots of fruits and vegetables that are potassium enriched as well.Drink plenty of water as well to help with the cramping. Good Luck.|`|N5H9lPETaa	ive been told that it can, normally when i run i eat bananas regularly, it seems to help with the after afftects of being sore and cramping, guess its to counter act the lactac acids built up in the muscles.

I was hospitalized for over a week. they pumped me full of i.v. potassium now I take two potassium tabs a day 99 mg  The doc explained to me that potassium is the only vitamin the human body does not produce on its own you generally get it from foods like bananas kiwi baked potatoes ect. unless it gets to low then you need intervention in the form of pills or i.v.s. depletion can be caused by being sick with vomiting, diarrhea,or overexertion, sweating, drinking alcohol, my depletion was caused by diuretics (water pills) I was taking for congestive heart failure. some of the symptoms include disorientation, slurred Speech,painful muscles, horrible night cramps in your legs. and that's just a few. so even if your not sure it really would not hurt to compensate for lack of potassium in your diet with a couple of 99mg tabs each day. I give each of my kids large bottle each christmas . to remind them how important it is. good luck

a866601a94a7a1716764f0de1f5f846caa	7 months is a long time - you could accomplish this with a little work.  First, find out how many calories you expend per day.  Use an online calculator to work it out (see source).  Then, add 500 to that number, and try to eat that many calories per day.  Eat at least 1g of protein per lb of body mass, so eat 170g to start with then eat more as your weight increases.    Hit the gym hard.  Concentrate on compound exercises such as squats, chins, dips, deadlifts and bench press.    As for diet, eat the same foods bodybuilders eat.  That is, eggs, oats, fish, lean meats, brown rice/pasta, milk, cottage cheese, and protein supplement if you need it.  See my sources for cheap online sellers.    To plan your diet such that you hit your calorie and protein needs, try the aidiets link in my source.  You can enter eg 170g protein and 3000 calories and it'll suggest meal plans you can use, with recipes, all free.    Good luck brah.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Defintitely possible.

ykIleAQ7aa	I look at a pair of jeans I used to be able to fit into. I think about how great I'm going to look this summer. And boom I get up and work out. In fact I've gotten addicted to working out! I get up at 5 am every day except Saturdays and I work out for 45-60 minutes. I guess you really got to want to look better than you already do. Also you may want to try to use a workout DVD a fun one like a dancing one. That way it won't really feel like working out. I got some belly dancing DVD workouts to start out with and it was a lot of fun. I like yoga so I do a lot of yoga and I just got a new Pilate's DVD that I think by the end of next month will get me exactly where I want to be - as far as fitting those jeans! :P   Good luck!|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I don't have a real motivation to tell you the truth I just walk my 2 dogs every night for an hour that's how I get a work out it clears my head  & I feel better|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	??

I've only been overweight once, growing up around the age of 12 maybe and as a grew up it just never carried with me.    I work out anyway, my constant goal is the fact that I'll be healthy on the inside and live longer, feel better, be happier, etc. & I'll look good. The hard work pays of and it really shows - and quickly!|`|VR0h4L32aa	i want to be strong and have a super muscular chest so i go workout    i listen to music to motivate me and see other ppl workout out at the gym|`|XTfr3uKQaa	That is a really good question. I find myself in that position alot as well. This sounds kind of messed up but I just start thinking about how much I don't like my body and how much I need to do something about it and that usually leads me into exercising.   Another way is to trick yourself into exercising by making really really small goals. It could be taking a 5 minute walk around your neighborhood, that seems doable and not very much, but once you're out there you'll probably keep going cause you'll be more in the mood! Or, youll say "okay im going to do 10 ab crunches" You get down on the floor, do 10 and you'll probably just keep doing some cause it didnt feel like much. And even if you dont, 10 is still something and it's the little things that add up!  Also, another obvious way is to just remember the feeling you have after working out, your body feels exhilirated, you feel lighter and healthy, you know that you've just burned a bunch of calories and you're on your way to your goal!|`|Q3bcGeaOaa	I don't lol.  Try to motivate,or work out.  Its a lot easier lol.

No you don't have to use tampons at all, you have a few different options.    Pads can be worn for swimming, but some will go soggy in water and come unstuck, you'd have to use cloth pads but only with light flow as when wet pads can't absorb as much flow. Period belts are longer than pads fastening around your waste so better protection and easier to hide, better still would be period panties, underwear with pads built-in so sit closer to your body giving you more protection. With pads wear shorts over the top to hide them. Lunapads cloth pads and padded panties http://www.lunapads.com Reddy's period belts http://www.reddyspads.com     Menstrual cups are the best option in general and certainly best for swimming, these are bell-shaped cups that collect menstrual flow, they are healthy, hygenic and more reliable than tampons or pads. You can leave them in for 12 hours without leaking so are better for swimming as you don't have to worry about embarrassment, they don't absorb pool water, and there is nothing outside your body so they are more discreet. Softcups are a similar idea, they are like menstrual cups but made from soft plastics and diaphragm-shaped so sit further up in your vagina. Divacup menstrual cup http://www.divacup.com Instead softcups http://www.softcups.com    It's down to you what you do, but don't worry about the coach if you don't want to swim or can't swim then tell your coach that you have your period, they obviously cannot force you to swim when you have your period and they can't force you to use anything you don't want to just so you can go swimming. If they try then simply refuse, they can't punish you for it.
osY0xlhTaa	There are lots of different ways to increase penis length and girth, but a lot of them are scams or are dangerous.    Surgery is one option, but is dangerous, very expensive, and not guaranteed to work - one survey showed over 60% of men were unhappy with the results of their penis enlargement surgery. Not an option I would choose.    There are lots of pills on the market, but most of them don't work at all, and the ones that do do not give you a bigger penis, just a slightly harder erection. They work by increasing the blood flow, but the only way to actually increase size is to increase the amount of blood the penis holds.     Every time you get an erection, the 2 chambers inside the penis fill with blood. Your penis size is limited by the size of these chambers, so the key to getting a bigger penis is to increase the size of these chambers.    The only way that you can do this is by doing penis enlargement exercises. If you do the right ones, and do them properly and consistently, you definitely can get results, but it does take a bit of time and effort.    If you want more information, I found a good site at http://www.biggerbetterman.com    Chek it out before you do anything - and good luck!|`|ZCzAhuafaa	viagra|`|W8krObaCaa	If this is a serious question:    Why?

Products like ExtenZe can make your penis bigger but only as long as you take it. I know that your penis has around 1 to 2 inches hidden in your pelvis.

I'm sure you can read up on certain products and see how theyre effect.
498JdszFaa	I used it for several years. It's easy and you don't have the daily risk of forgetting to take a pill. If you use their text message service you won't forget to take it out/place a new one at the right moment.    If you take it out longer then 3 hours (while it should be in) protection is no longer guaranteed, so it works just like the pill, when you quit you can become pregnant.     It can be in the way when having sex though, depending on the sensitivity of you and your partner. I would give it a try, see if it works for you. You can always switch back to the pill.|`|StxCHnTkaa	I used the Nuva for a few months and loved how easy it was, however...I gained weight on it.

9pLdhuBnaa	The kind of injuries you had could be a contributing factor to the seizure you had in your sleep a few nights ago.    The doctors can tell if one has had a seizure or about to have another one by doing a special kind of test called an EEG (electroencephalogram).    I would recommend asking for a consultation with a neurologist (a doctor that diagnoses and treats diseases and disorders that relate to the central nervous system such as concussions and contusions).
AA12307022	If you do the cycling before the stairs it will elevate your heart rate and make it easier to maintain an elevated heart rate (which burns calories).  Doing the cycling and stairs back to back will keep your body burning calories for longer. As for the yoga it depends on the type and purpose of the yoga- if it is a warm up yoga for stretching then before is better, but some yoga routines are better geared towards a "cool down" routine. Others still are more geared towards relaxation. You should be careful how close to bed you do your exercise as it activates your body which could result in poor sleep quality (which is both bad for you, and would actually be detrimental to your weight reduction goal).|`|1AMMxZZvaa	According to an article I read lately, it is swimming that burns much calories from our body.

Gy9kt139aa	Your crown is just there to replace your old tooth. It helps you to chew food like your old tooth did, and to look more aesthetically pleasing than a big gap. It shouldn't be a problem if you lost it; you can just get a new one.     The next time you go to the dentist, make sure you set up your next appointment while you're there.

lRMWU4M6aa	Well how long ago did you get it??? Pain and swelling are not unusual for 3-5 days, and it might be uncomfortable for another few days after that. Make sure to use the "few pinches of salt in boiled water thats been allowed to cool" saline solution to soak it every day, and don't play with it. You'll be fine.    Edit - just to point out, I doubt its infected, as you'd smell it/taste it and see masses of ooze. Also, its very important that, even if it DOES become infected, you leave the ring in. If you take a piercing out of an infected wound, it'll close over and form an abcess.

Instead it can lose you weight, depending however on your food intake after exercising. The question of staying young is a different story since aging is a normal process. We all come to that point one day.|`|FJpPCVTCaa	your body replenishes nutrients, repairs and builds new muscles after workouts, so if you continue heavy exercises for prolonged periods of time without adequate rest, you are going to destroy your body's health.|`|eLxcDtItaa	No because he's training his muscles to be strong.

I know stress also ages you too so stay positive!|`|kXq90b09aa	We have two types of very common exercising, one is cardio where you keep you heart rate high for a certain period of time and you lose fat while exercising and burn glucose for the next 24-36 hours, If you choose to supplement this type of exercising with a strict diet, although you look thinner and healthy, you lose muscles (as you burn glucose) thus you become very unhealthy.     The other type is interval training, where you do very high intense exercises for a minute or two and take intervals and repeat the procedure, this way you use up glucose while exercising and burn fat for the rest of 24-48 hours and strengthen your muscles, increase good cholesterol by 25% in 6 months. (best examples are marathon runners and sprinters)  In short staying healthy depends on what type of exercising and diet you choose!

It improves your metabolism and burns calories which keeps fat and insulin levels at a optimal level. It improves circulation and keeps your lungs healthy, which makes daily activites easier to accomplish. Regular exercise also allows for stronger muscles, and better back strength, which improves posture and movement. This is particularly important for women over the age of 50. If you sat around and didn't do anything active, your chances for heart disease, diabetes, poor circulation, bad posture and muscle tears are much more probable.

ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively).     The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.    Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.    Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past. Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge (professional is best). Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread.|`|cUYunFvHaa	see a doctor, get valium!!!|`|NwT6CpRUaa	focus on what causes your anxiety. now take this list and put it order from most anxious to least. now start at the bottom of this list and put yourself in this situation for a extended period of time or a few times until the anxiety decreases. once u over come one try the next.    or    when your alone take a note pad and think about what causes your anxiety and write it down. once you have written it down read it at least one time a day. and imagine you are in the situations you have written down until they no longer bother you.|`|ebD1plKNaa	Various people have trouble with this type of thing.

No brain disease? I question his credentials; Is he into CAM or Scientology?

2soyTz7eaa	Shivers are reflexes, which are things your body does automatically to keep you safe and healthy. Reflexes are controlled by your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, your spinal cord, and lots and lots of little nerves that stretch out all over your body.  The signals go to your brain and to your spinal cord, which sends a message to other nerves all over your body. What happens next? Your muscles tighten and loosen really fast. Why? They're trying to warm you up, just like taking a jog around the lake would do.  There are other times when you might shiver, too. Sometimes you'll shiver when you're excited or afraid. When you feel these things, your brain and nerves send out messages through your body that cause your muscles to get excited, so you shiver.|`|DYiQtwMJaa	to produce heat and warm ur a** ,was that a serious question !!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10453678	to warm itself
uuQrhnJ4aa	Some meds prescribed for anxiety can cause depression & vice versa.  This is something you should discuss w/your doctor. Sometimes dosages can be adjusted, another pill can be added to complement the effects of the anxiety med, or you could switch anxiety meds altogether.     There are diff meds for anxiety. Sometimes one will work for you for a while & then stop working or start causing side effects. Sometimes you have to try diff ones in the beginning to find the appropriate one for you.     It could be the depression is secondary to the anxiety. However, many disorders & deficiencies have the same symptoms as depression. Once again, this is the time to consult w/your physician. Other physical problems can be ruled out with an exam & testing.     Sometimes depression is situational and can follow or precipitate stressful events (whether those events are happy or sad...they're still stressors & the body reacts accordingly-you've got a big one coming up ltr this yr).     Depression can also be due to vitamin D deficiency, thyroid disorders or even seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which is treated by light therapy, antidepressants & talk/cognitive behavioral therapy.     Try to maintain a regular schedule, eat a balanced diet, get moderate exercise, rest/sleep adequately. Any other alternative recommendations are based on anecdotal evidence instead of science. Once you see your physician, your mind will be alleviated.    I have personal & professional experience w/anxiety & depression. Neither are a piece of cake & require diligent treatment. I wish you the best!|`|71ae4755ec6533f862aed7b1761c0dccaa	I'm guessing your taking an SSRI?  They occassionally have unfortunate paradoxical side effects such as causing anxiety and depression.  And rarely they can make people feel suicidal.  They have warnings on the internet about it.    When you go see your doctor if you want to stop taking meds he can give you a schedule to taper off the pills slowly.  This will minimize withdrawal stymptoms.  Don't go cold turkey.  I did it years ago and it was rough.

BG8vMyZjaa	Yes to the above re nuts, avocado, peanut butter, but with the latter choose one without added sugar like 'Whole Earth'.  You need to take in more calories than you burn. Combining this with toning exercises helps, too.  Set yourself a realistic target and aim to gain weight gradually, at around 1kg (2.2lb) a month. For that you'll need an extra 300kcal to 350kcal a day. This is best done as part of a balanced diet.  Keep a food diary for a couple of weeks to learn more about your eating habits and to identify where you can add calories.  One way is to make meals a little larger or more calorific. Have an extra slice of toast at breakfast, drink grape juice rather than orange juice, make coffee with milk or serve an extra spoon of potato, rice or pasta.  Although exercise burns calories, it's important to include some form of activity into your plan to keep your bones strong and your muscles toned.  Aim for 30 minutes' physical activity five days a week and combine this with some resistance training. Take care not to be too active. If you're always on your feet, make time to relax each day.|`|spXPpyP0aa	PEANUT BUTTER|`|C3sqTngtaa	NUTS and Avocados|`|zeZtFbGjaa	i wish i had ur problem|`|pjJlPXWJaa	if its fattening then its not healthy is it?|`|x0flaLfUaa	Yeah, nuts,

At your age you should eat as much as you can because you need to grow muscle. When you are 16 you could go to the gym and pack on muscle.

Instead of helping you up in the snow and checking that you're okay, he shouts at you for " wearing the wrong shoes"  He sounds more like he's behaving like your father.  And yes, btw, before I get my period, not only am I not thinking straight, I'm irritable, aggressive, grumpy, paranoid ... the list goes on honestly.  You deserve a big hug and a big apology from your boyfriend.  Try to have a good day.

I had heavy menses with cramps, I took BCP, ovulan 21 it was called in the 70's , probably stronger than what is prescribed today. I took them for 6 mo for bad cramps, 7 day cycles, and had severe constipation, then diarrhea and vomiting with it. Igot it at age 12 and didn't get help until age 16 when I got sick at school and the school nurse called my mom who finally took me to the doctor. My mom's were like that too,so maybe she thought that's the way it was. her's got better after having kids, I never had children. I took them again when I was 22 for about a few yrs, then stopped. I still had cramps, but not so bad, but I did notice behavior patterns and had to work around that, I'd get extremely sleepy , too, food cravings for chocolate.  He needs to be more understanding and accept this is not your will and you wish it wouldn't happen either. He needs to be supportive and work with you, but, please discuss with doc, there are meds that can help and I don't mean anti depressants. don't use those.|`|s2mRxbEYaa	Well, that happens to majority of females who will be having their period. Most of the time this episode starts 3-5 days before having your period. It's mostly because of sudden change of hormonal levels that's why you become psychotic at times.  (It always happen to me, actually it is a monthly episode, and my boyfriend for 3 years is already used to it.:D)    You can't blame your boyfriend to be mad because he can't understand what's happening and you can't even rationalize what you've done.

ksx4HxMeaa	yes there are many ways to stop a panic attack before it happens, not only do you have to get your mind right, you have to breath right. At the very onset of thinking you may be having a panic attack you have to stop and take a deep breath, hold it in, then release and feel the thing you are worried about release out your back like vapor and steam. try to stretch upword and put your arms out and make a circle with them, usually that should do it, if not you may need a more exact method of preventing panic attacks.|`|F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.    Check out the reference for the full UNBIASED comparison and review.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	You'd have to ask your doctor to put you on some kind of antianxiety medication.|`|dqvZmj22aa	breathing exercises.  Doing slow deep breathing as a habit can make it easier to stop a panic attack in it's tracks.|`|bpM4ZHjGaa	Yes.  Panic attack prevention starts by monitoring your thoughts.  See, panic attacks occur when you have what's called a "negative thought loop".  That's a stream of negative thoughts that spiral out of control.      They heighten the anxiety and eventually escalate it to the point of physical symptoms - a panic attack.    Try using a strategy called "Consecutive Thought Control".  It's a natural exercise that teaches you to filter your thoughts and focus on the positive.  Mastery of this technique will stop your panic attacks permanently.

MmCxv97oaa	it depends on ur body frame  but that sounds normal  im the same height weighing round 68 kilos|`|61KNbfIuaa	i'm 174cm tall and i weigh 64kg, but i'm a boy and i'm not skinny    generally girls should be a bit lighter but it depends what your genes are as well    anyway, youre not overweight, just a tiny bit heavier than average for your height
mFctlUD0aa	Wow, well it seems that you are in a bit of a funk. So let us take a look at what is the core problem, it is not your weight, because you have been able to lose weight before, so what we are looking at is the funk you are in.  I suggest that you set some goals, remember that we are a three fold person, we are physical, emotional, spiritual. I would set a goal in each of these areas, each goal has to be one that you need to streach to reach but does not need to be so big you can not reach it.  I believe that once you set a goal and then set steps on how you plan on reaching each goal. The prospect of having a goal something to achive will help give you motivation. Now about your eating habits, I would suggest that you take a look at a supplemental program. one that will give the body the proper nutrients that it needs to be healthy but not so many calories.  I personally like the Herbalife program and have found it to be the best but there are many programs out there. I personally lost 20lbs and over a foot of body fat in 2 weeks on the Herbalife program.  I wish you luck and hope this is of use to you|`|bxlYleZkaa	In the UK???? Then the ONLY weight loss programme which will work for the rest of your life is  LighterLife. Look up their website, call them and they will put you in touch with your nearest councillor.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	??

I feel your pain im pretty much the same way right now. I have been doing walking videos they are easy impact. I hope you get the answer your looking for. Anything you do takes commitment.|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Perhaps its the stress that is making you gain weight. I think that you should try and bring in things that you enjoy into your life, like different activities, not only do they make you healthier but also uplift your moods. I know how you feel, when im stressed or depressed the last thing I want to do is exercise, but then last week I went for a swim and felt soo much better. Swimming is great, I find for burning calories swimming is a winner and its also good for your joints, were as running although burns a lot of calories can put pressure onto your joints and organs.  Start implementing healthy eating and exercise.. but not only that be good to yourself .. have a balanced life.. its not all about work work work and you mustn't let stress run you down because stress causes so many health problems.. diabetes etc etc   Hope you feel better soon xx|`|07vq1Y8iaa	Losing weight is all about calories. The human body is only capable of losing 2lbs a week of body-fat. When trying to lose weight you must try to eat between 300-600 calories below your maintenance levels. For example... Im a big guy and my Maintenance calorie levels are 2600 now in order for me to lose weight i have to eat 2100 calories. Now that i know how many calories i need to eat to lose weight slowly and safely i have to choose a diet with types of food that will all add up to 2100 calories...    But first you will need to calculate your Maintenance calories which is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body weight. You can easily do that in the following link http://yoursuperbody.com/A-Nutrition-die... and scroll down to the Calorie Counter and then click "Settings" then fill in your Weight and Age etc. Once you have completed that subtract somewhere between 300-500 calories from your Maintenance Calories and then begin using the Calorie Counter to work out what food and how much of it you can eat.    Good-luck  Any questions feel free to email me  Anthony|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Go to your local gym and ask a personal advisor to put you on a plan.  You will need to start eating healthy too as a way to get your metabolism working and to rid those toxins from the unhealthy foods you will need to drink tons of water and hearbal teas.  Whilst at work I eat 4-5 small meals today as I train hard on a night time.  So you may be advised to eat a few smaller healthy meals to speed up weight loss. A lot of people do the mistake of eating less and nothing at all  to lose weight, this is the wrong thing to do as it shocks the body.  When u go home from work, try gentle skipping or jogging around the block you live, you will see results within a month. Good luck!|`|ofOVjNJRaa	Eating a small amount of food cannot help you lose weight; it is eating the right food, no matter how less it is, that can keep you on excellent weight. Exercise may not help you as it depends on how your body reacts to extraneous activities. Eat on time. Your meal should be planned. And avoid junk foods all the time.|`|kXq90b09aa	My guess is you need to burn the extra fat with a work out plan that is very interesting which boosts up your mood and motivation. Here is the best available method to lose fat, "Interval Training" or "High Intense Interval Training" (HIIT),     jog for 2 mins, brisk walk for 2 mins and sprint for 2 mins or less..this is an interesting workout and better for your health in every way! Another effective way of doing interval training is sprint (as fast as you can) for 15 secs to 1 min, rest for 3-5 mins and do it again, repeat this 4 times in one session. OR do any exercise in this manner and get the best results!   Note that interval training should be done only 3-4 times a week (3 sessions the best) and you will lose fat drastically.    watch these for more info    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIupxbukU...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym7d2MzZ9...

We have been miss led for some time about the "honor" of going to war. We as a nation do not go to war for family , of honor , or even freedom. We go to war so that the wealthy can further line there pockets with the profits of war. Think about it , someone has got to be making a bundle off of the guns, k-rations, camouflage clothes, tents... the list goes on like the energizer bunny. Isn't it funny that you never hear of politicians children going off to fight in a war? I will not send my son to die so that Halaburton can line its pocket . Maybe if we lined there pockets with the spilled blood or limbs that have been shot off.|`|AA12118274	Everybody who is in the millatary in Iraq is 18 years old at least. They are adults and make their own decitions. Nobodys parents send them.     It is young men and women that have made us free. It is young men and women that we sent to France and on to Germany that keeped the rest of the world free. I dont know where you live but I where ever it is you should thank those young American men that were sent to keep the world free from Nazi Germany.     "There is not life (victory) in death" Tell that to the people in the consentration camps in ww2, tell that to the french under nazi occupation in ww2.     Do you think you would be where you are at unless young men had taken up guns. Think about it. You are a coward.|`|8ba6a1763e2363f6da5d202d62fc504aaa	Because people who join the military are adults not children who need their parents permission to do stupid and immoral things.|`|AA11168618	my daughter lost her brother in iraq it was a suicide bomber  she is still so proud of him and talks about him all the time he was going to his base to sign out but he joined up again we all pray for our boys in iraq  but nobody  forces them too join  up|`|7137a1579b7f1f3c8f1bbd563e224ae2aa	if they are in the military they already knew they would have to go to war that is what its for right|`|9a1927052af3cfe75c499b9dae20cabfaa	War is truly human kinds most horrible disease. War is the breeding ground for death and chaos which will untimately lead to revenge which in turn leads to war again. People join the army out of pride for their nation. They are fighting for what they believe in and you may be able to speak sermons on a moutain but that will in no way change their minds. Just like you are strong willed in your opinions, so are they and may be even more so. You can not change the minds of the entire world.   I never truly believe that parents send their children off to war on purpose. Of course, I am looking at this from an american perspective (amercan kids joining up in the army and watnot). Although, I do acknowledge that there may be some cases that have shown that the parents have forced their children into the military. But in all fairness, most recruits have joined the military because they want to fight for their country and what they believe in, they need a way to pay for college or graduate school, or they haven't found a purpose in life and see the military as there only way to survive. There are also the few that have grown up in military homes and thus admire their parents or uncles or brothers and sister that have worked for the military.  The military shouldn't be blamed for war. The military was created out of the chaos of mankinds greed and wickedness. Look to your politics for the roots of this evil. For from politics and greed came forth the military and thus war as we know it.    Keep in mind also that freedom is never given. Freedom is never free and must be sought for and only those that work hard to obtain it receive it. I don't condone wars of any kind, but freedom is something worthwhile.|`|AA11381771	you may be right, but if there is a military background then they would be obliged to send there children.  sending your children to the army is doing a favour to the country.  your giving back to your country, and helping defending it from foreign oppression and defending all that you hold dear.    Death is inevitable.

Just prey to lord that the head of the country is not a war mongeryou can retire in peace and not killed by an enemy bullet|`|AA11326784	Please read:    I wonder if we agree about what freedom is.  It may be that we have different pictures what freedom is, which would make this argument void because we do not agree on a precept (one of the basic facts of the argument).  In order for you to understand why I support the effort you have to see what I see.    You said, "Im not saying dont fight for YOUR freedom if you have to but what about the little girl in the Middle East what about her freedom?"    Indeed, what about her freedom?  I suppose that you don't think 'freedom' includes freedom from the fear of being stoned to death based only on a man's word (Taliban ruled Afghanistan, Pakistan etc...).  I suppose you don't think 'freedom' entails the ability to say whatever you want about the government without fear of being improsoned, tortured and killed (like Iraq:  1 or the muslim brotherhood in Egypt).  Does 'freedom' include the ability to search your heart for the word of G-d without fear of being executed or discriminated against if you pick anything but the particular sect that is in the majority (Sadam's Baath party)?  Does freedom include having a publicly disclosed government agency running and editing all news outlets and information sharing websites (Bahrain:  2, Iran, Saddam's Iraq).  Does freedom include brainwahing (Palestine:  3)?    I imagine that you think of freedom as a lack of war.    We went to war to free the people of Iraq.  Since then the power-hungry forces displaced during the fighting in Afghanistan have coalesced in Iraq joined by new desperados from nearby countries also brainwashed in believing that the west has 'stolen' something from them (the glory the of greater Middle East in centuries of old was lost by them, not stolen by us)    According to the 'Iraqi Body Count' (an antiwar group) 40% of Iraqi dead were killed by the self proclaimed 'freedom fighters' (i.e. Al-Quaida in Iraq), does that make any sense?  There are no freedom fighters in Iraq, because there is no occupying force in Iraq.  The people killing Iraqi's are the insurgents (imported from local countries by Jihadiist extremists).  These people are trying to oppress the people of Iraq (and other places) by creating in them fear, and then offering to take that fear away in exchange for safety, just like the the mobsters in Sicily, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Nazis in Germany or the fascists of Italy.    These murderers offer to prevent the death and carnage that they themselves bring on the Iraqi people if the Iraqi people enact Sharia law.  They ask the Iraqi's to exchange the 'freedom of choice' (the freedom of who to be, where to go, how to worship and love G-d)  for the 'freedom from fear.'    As an American who enjoys every freedom imaginable I felt that we had a duty to help our brothers and sisters in mankind to be free from an evil dictator (go ahead, defend Saddam's regime) because I believe that the great I am created every single human being, and that we are all deserving of freedom.  I do not believe that 'freedom fighters' who want to tell everyone in the country exactly how to act upon threat  of death should be given power.     Now as I reflect on the tremendous  on the tremendous hardship that has meant for us, on the toll that we have paid so that they can be free, I wonder if giving freedom to people who don't want it desperately for themselves is worth all that cost.  Then I remember, we are all made by G-d, in his image, and we (all of us) deserve respect, freedom, and honor.      No, war is not a good answer, but sometimes it is the only answer.  We should not have beeen so callous in our decision to go to war, and I am sorry.  I am sorry that I didn't demand more proof, but I believe what we did can benefit mankind if we only finish the mission and bring a self governing body to power in Iraq.  It is difficult, but we need YOUR support.  Please help us.  We want to give the power to the Iraqi's but we need help...          I don't think you'll read this.  I belive that you have written this question somply to incite.  If you do read it, and you would like to challenge anything, just contact me.

2sycPf8Daa	If distress caused by a traumatic( having been molested)event affects your life, seeing your health care professional is an important first step. But you can take actions to help yourself cope as you continue with treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.    Often perpetrators will control the person they are abusing with threats. It is normal for someone who has been molested to be very afraid of retaliation against him/herself or worse, against his/her family or friends. This is why it is so very important to report this to police. In some cases, it may be best for the person being abused to stay in a shelter or with someone to mind them, at least for a while.       You sound like a great person who's losing themselves in their life. Find some defiance in you. After all, the world runs according to survival of the fittest. By not standing up and making your decisions, you're saying that you're not strong enough to deal with the challenges that thousands of people deal with every day. I'm sure this isn't true. Don't prove it to others, prove it to yourself.  Take care as always!

If you've had a pelvic exam, where the gynecologist used a speculum, that doesn't mean your hymen is broken.  I had pelvic exams before I got married, my hymen was still in tact.  The bleeding can be from getting the pap smear.  But to answer your question, it depends on a lot of things.  It might hurt, it might not.  Just use lots of lubricant, astroglide is good, and relax.  Your husband's size will be a factor, and there are other conditions that can cause painful intercourse.  If pain is extreme or doesn't subside after having intercourse a few times, you should consult a doctor.|`|qsv4NmbDaa	The reason sex hurts is not because of your cherry, but because of your vagina stretching.

Make sure that you and your partner engage in lots of foreplay including stimulation of the clitoris as most women cannot climax from penetration alone.

Remember, sex is not just for men ie penetration!

ExSTxiBWaa	If you're nervous about it, tell your doctors and they can prescribe something to help you relax before and during the procedure. Tell them all of your concerns, they want you to be comfortable.. if you have the right sedatives before your surgery, you won't care a thing about a little needle and probably won't even remember the procedure once its overwith. totally worth it to be rid of pain :]|`|x0J8S5sWaa	I'm not not expert on surgery and frankly don't even know what a ganglion is, but from what you said about it causing you immense pain I would definately suggest that if it can be treated, get it treated.

Tell your doctor your fears and they can probably work something out that both you and they can work with :) Goodluck!|`|x4PIT0fRaa	i had sugery and its not that bad. you go to sleep. wake up and its all fixed. i never felt a thing. i felt soo much better i wished i did it sooner to avoid pain. so its ok go get that thing removed!!!    ps im only 14 so dont be scared|`|xFTAeLtcaa	I am never scared of needles and nor should you be..what is a few seconds that it takes for them to use the needle,,nothing.

I think you should not be worried about a needle.
RvXwjC7Yaa	the one thing you've got to remember is that the older you are when you shave the better, even shaving when you are sixteen with be loads worse then shaving a year after as a year would mean shaving atlease twice as often, and having to cope with incredibly thick hairs (each time you shave, your hair becomes much thicker when it grows back, and grows much faster) So along the lines of how old you are, i salute you for not shaving when i did (13) im in a really bad state with my mustach now, it sticks out at all ends and is very thick, so one up for u!  It's always an akward feeling for when you start shaving, you feel you want to tell somebody you have, but you also feel slightly shy and embaressed. this is normal behaviour, puberty teaches this, trust me it happens to EVERYBODY but ull eventually get over it:)    the advice that i can give is, the first time you shave, dont look into the mirror the next day searching for more hairs to shave off, a first time shaver should wait atleast 2-3 weeks before his next shave, doing it 3 days later will alter the process and you hair will come back at an astonishly bigger rate then it should do. u used a razor to shave, that's fine, but personally i think the first time you shave, since your hair is nice and soft, you should use a trimmer, this will prove very useful as it will take as much hair off as the razor (your hair is soft) but your hair will grow back a lot softer than with a razor, and you have less chance off injuring yourself with a trimmer, AND sometimes with a razor your skin where you shaved goes really pale, this will not happen witha trimmer, so i suggest you use a trimmer for some months, when the hair starts getting really thick and the trimmer does'nt get all hairs off properly, start useing your razor again.  doin your shaving incorrectly is no big deal, cutting yourself or whatever is normal, even shaving wrong is normal, just do it again when the hair grows back and do it proplerly!  all the steps uve shown are perfect, you could'nt shave any better, well done on that. but personally, after a but, i would shave against the growth of the hairs.  just the main thing to remember is...dont shave too often, try shaving as less as often if you can help it, trust me, it may seem alright now, but in later life your hairs gonna be incredibly thick if you shve too often.  shaving every 2 weeks is fine, after about a year of shaving you can switch to every 1 and a half weeks, and then the next year switch to every5-6 days and so on...  hope this helps!|`|8PS1ubX6aa	step by step|`|9vmnr0iQaa	I'm also 17 and iv been shaving since i was 16, but i only had a tash back then. i dont rly have massive stubble or anything but it just anoys me to have gay facial hair on my chin and lower cheeks lol    You're shaving fine and i don't know why you feel awkward about telling your dad, when mine taught me how to shave it was quite cool feeling like an adult.     People develope at different speeds and i know people who are 18 and havnt shaved ever, and people who are 16 with full on beards (ahhhhh!!) lmao.

AA12266052	Warts (verrucae vulgaris) are common, benign epidermal lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection. They can appear anywhere on the body in a variety of morphologies. Diagnosis is by examination. Warts are usually self limited but may be treated by excision, cautery, cryotherapy, liquid nitrogen, and topical or injected agents.  Over-the-counter (OTC) medications containing salicylic acid are often effective in removing warts. Keeping a wart loosely covered with duct tape for many weeks may also help it to disappear. However, any wart that does not respond to OTC treatments should be examined by a dermatologist.|`|AA10174754	Better to go to expert doctor

AA12206399	Congrats on becoming vegetarian. You are on your way to a healthier lifestyle.    The average person needs approximately 60 grams of protein per day.  If you are an athlete or someone who is extremely active, you could need more (up to 1 gram per pound).      There are some excellent, vegetarian sources of protein. If you go to your health food store, you'll find a plethora of soy-based protein foods that taste good.  Soy milk, dairy products, eggs, tofu, beans, veggie burgers, chillis, etc are all excellent sources of protein.    I recommend that you take a multi-vitamin every day -- one that includes iron / minerals. Most newbie vegetarians often don't eat enough minerals and wind up deficient.  Consider using a free web site such as http://www.fitday.com to monitor your protein and mineral / vitamin intake.    Good luck.|`|AA12308795	College textbooks on nutrition say that protein deficiency is rare in the world and does not exist in this part of the world. Americans get too much protein. There is a lot in beans, nuts and seeds.    Many vegans eat over 80% fruit. BUT there are things that vegetarians get too little of. See site below. I checked UK veg site above and it says that EXCESS dietary protein is bad and vegetarian may be better since it provides enough but not excess.|`|AA10310496	This is the link to the Vegetarian Society UK's food fact information.

It is very easy to disrupt the pH level in the vagina and get an infection. Your vagina also has a way of naturally keeping itself clean. I know the odor tells a different story but it is true. Douching too much can cause the vagina not to cleanse itself, therefore, requiring one to douche more often. The best thing to do is wash the outer area with a rag,soap and water and leave the inside alone and let nature do it's job.|`|AA12086369	nuetrogena makes a clear face bar with no color or any type of scent.  you can use it to wash down there anytime you feel that you need to, but once a week is the most i would do if you aren't having sex regularly.    ABSOLUTELY NO DOUCHING.  NONE!!!!!!!!! that will change the ph levels down there and...  well, to put it simply you would only be pushing anything you were trying to wash out in further.  you only need to wash the outer moust area.  and rinse well afterwards.  try to avoid any scented body washes when you take a shower.  i use the neutrogena acne free body wash--it's a little strong for washing down there, but i don't have any problems with it...  without, i tend to get yeast infections.      but, start out with the bar, as it is soap, with no perfumes or color.

8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	Results from studies are mixed on the effect that the hormone estrogen has on a woman's risk of lupus or of having lupus flares. For example, while most women do not have symptom flares during pregnancy, when a woman has a high level of estrogen, a few women do have flares during pregnancy. And although most women develop lupus when they are age 15 to 45, when estrogen levels are higher, a number of women develop lupus after menopause, when estrogen levels are low.    Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and birth control pills (oral contraceptives) do not appear to affect a woman's risk of lupus. Birth control pills also do not appear to increase the chance of symptom flares in women with moderate lupus that is inactive or under control.3    Some research suggests smoking may increase the risk of getting lupus.|`|992f4ed91495448a70fe8e6c36df9007aa	Estrogen MAY cause lupus to flare. The jury is still out.    Lupus does not cause estrogen to increase.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Only eating 2 meals a day is horrible for your health. You should be having at least 3 to 5. (Obviously not massive meals.)    Check this site out,    www.sparkpeople.com     It might be able to help you. ??|`|pNiqqVsYaa	You probably have never heard of this before but it's true and has been PROVEN in psychology.  Basically the hypothalamus uses leptin to try and put you at the weight you were genetically designed to be at IN A FOOD ABUNDANT environment like the U.S..  When you go bellow your set point weight your body does many things-I know this because I use to be a chronic dieter, and I had an eating disorder which started with anorexia to a small degree then bullimia and then binge eating so here is the truth in a nut shell.    Things that happen to you when you go bellow your set point:    -it increases your thinking about food so you think about it more often than you would if you were at your set point weight.    -When you start to eat it takes way more than normal to become full and you binge eat i.e. increased appetite.  This is why a lot of people become anorexic they are afraid when they start to eat they won't be able to stop or they start purging and get bulimia.    -You get what is called "extensive taste RESPONSIVENESS to SWEET FOOD and sugar.  It happens in rats too.  Basically when you are at a normal weight shortly AFTER you eat some sweet food it starts to taste sickeningly sweet i.e. this is your bodies way of keeping you from going ABOVE your set point.  When you are not of a normal weight your body doesn't get taste responsiveness and you can keep eating sugary foods which turn to fat quickly.      This is what happens when you go above your set point.    -your appetite falls    -you don't think about food     -metabolism speeds and kills the extra calories      Think about it most skinny people eat the same crap fat people do.  Some fat people eat a lot, some don't.  Some skinny people eat a lot, some don't.    _____________________________    This is probably a lot for you to take in but it is TRUE DEAR.      Proof of set point is written in all kinds of MEDICAL journals and by psychologists.  You won't find it on the diet channel though.  However there is one BOOK YOU MUST READ WHICH WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THIS AND HELP YOU WITH YOUR PROBLEM.          The book is called "Making Peace With Food By: Susan Kano.  She talks all about set point A LOT in there and what you can do if you have problems with weight diet, binge eat or have anorexia.     __________________________     What is my set point?    Your set point is probably *close* to the weight you were at before you were even worrying about your weight, having anorexia, or thinking about calories at all.      ______________________________________...      What should I do now to get over this problem?    Don't think about calories, BMI, worry about weight, or start weighing yourself all the time.    This sounds hard at first but it's truly the best thing to do hun.    Conclusion    Dieting and a weight obessed culture is a very bad thing.  Now that you are wiser about this from understand set point hopefully you realize how destructive it is when people put on diet commercials, crazy magazines emphasizing being thin, and worse yet people who make fun of people for their weight.  We all need to learn to love one and other and treat each other with respect no matter what our weight is.  If society learned to love and respect one and other not based on things like weight, the world we be a better place for everyone....oh! except for the diet industry because they would finally be out of business.       Peace, love and *hugs*       A good site to look at as well as get the book I stated is bellow.    http://www.mirror-mirror.org/set.htm
zFPn7OJTaa	Well, I'm assuming since you're one of the first to get your period, you're like 12?    So, I know what you mean. I know where you're coming from. Is your teacher a male or female?    A 12 or so year old isn't expected, or shouldn't be expected, to wear a tampon.     Just say to your dad "Dad, I'm only 12, I can't use a tampon yet. I'm too young. I'm scared." - Dad's always try to protect their daughters.  Your dad should talk to your teacher. Ask your dad to point out the embarrassment of blood trickling down your leg infront of everybody, or taking off your underwear infront of them and they see your pad.     It shouldn't leak too much, if you put the pad on right, and it is stuck correctly to your underwear then it might leak a little bit, but not too much. I think you'll be fine for the most part.    I know it's frustrating, it will get easier. Don't be too scared and don't constantly think about your period, it makes it harder. Try tampons every few cycles and see if you can put one in. Find the SMALLEST tampon you can (you may have to try different places) and just try. If you're not successful for a while, don't worry too much about it. Your young, your vagina is tight.|`|GPNF7Ds7aa	let me tell you wearing a tampon is not a big deal, its easy and you dont even notice its there, dont be afraid to talk to ya dad, just say hey dad we have swimming and i need tampons can you get me some, he wont care, he wont even want to got further into the discussion|`|1ykzSRtKaa	Dont worry sweetie, beign the first in your group to have your period may seem like a big thing now but in a year or two it will be nothing !    The best thing you can try and do is relax, talk to your dad about getting some tampons and maybe talk to your teacher.     Dont be afraid to tell your friends, if they are girls, they will be going through what you are very soon so just relax.
Dy11NInPaa	It is not clear in your question if you are vomiting blood or if when you just "spit", it is bloody, like from your mouth. If you are vomiting blood, you need to see a physician to figure out why; you could have an ulcer in your stomach which would need attention. If it is just bleeding from your mouth, determine if you have pain in your mouth; it could be a sore in your mouth causing the bleeding.  The stress could have indeed caused a stomach ulcer which could cause you to vomit blood. I do not know the amount; you haven't made that clear. But either way, if you are vomiting blood, you should see a MD whether you want to or not. Vomiting blood does not mean death is immediately occurring, so stop stressing about that; don't let that add to your anxiety that you already have. Go to the doctor, figure out what is wrong, and that should help lower the anxiety you do have. The doctor could also probably help you figure out why you are so stressed and maybe prescribe you some medication to alleviate your anxiety.  So, unfortunately, I do feel that you should go to the hospital. But I do not think that you are dying.  Hope you feel better.

AA11565057	I know you're upset, but why are you saying you've been through more stuff then your schoolmates will experience in their life time? I don't think it's true at all.    Let me tell you a story about a friend of mine. She once told me that I'd be a terrible Psychologist because I'd never been through anything. She assumed that her own bad experiences in life would make her a good Psychologist and that I hadn't experienced things. She was completely and utterly wrong. I'd been through things that no person should ever have to go through, the types of things that people are meant to fall apart over, the types of things that you see women crying about on Oprah saying 20 years later and they still haven't dealt with it. Unlike her though, I didn't constantly talk about how hard I had things because I was stronger than that. She had absolutely no idea that I'd been through such things - no one did, because I didn't feel the need to tell them. I told her many years later about the things that had happened to me growing up that she didn't know about because she never stopped to think that maybe she wasn't the only one with problems. She begged for my forgiveness. She had that a long, long time ago though.     Seriously, you're saying you can't make friends but then you're making quite negative assumptions about the people around you. Maybe you're treating these people like they don't know anything. Certainly that's coming through in your attitude here. People can sense if you approach them with a negative attitude, and if you do, it's hard to befriend them, and it's hard for them to want to be friends with you!     You need to talk to your parents about it. If you really can't cope, it's not the end of the world if you change schools, even in year 12. You can always do year 12 over two years at different schools. It's not the end of the world if you do. A new city with new people may help and it may not, who knows? Moving has helped people before and it can teach good skills about making friends. But it's not a decision that anyone can make for you.|`|NO43XYA2aa	GO TO STROMWIND, IRONFORGE, OR DARNASSUS.

ijduNTgyaa	Its not going to matter what anyone else thinks, it only matters what you think and if your happy with your body.    If you think something needs to change, here are some tips.    Ok for eating, dont eat junk...duh, thats easy a lot of people know that. Try to not eat a lot of salty things, it traps water in you and it doesnt help you lose weight. Drink lots and lots of water, stay away from slim fast/vitamin water/energy drinks, some might be good the energy drinks are horrible for you and water beats them all out for quality and its FREE! Water is the bodies oil. Drink more and youll feel great. Try to eat small but more portions of good food throughout the day, it speeds up your matabolism.     To burn fat, you need cardio and lots of it. Go running, biking, swimming, jump rope is pretty good and fun sometimes and rowing.     But if your serious about losing FAT you need to forget about your scale and just look at your body. Muscle weighs a lot more than fat so if you start working out and get discouraged because your gaining weight its because your getting toner, and thats a good thing!     Ok then, some good work outs for ya...These are gonna be good for ya because you dont even need a gym or any real equipment, just mostly dead weight exercises.    For the buns  Plie  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, arms at sides, toes turned out.  Tuck tailbone under and contract glutes.  Lower body into a plie squat as low as you can go without allowing knees to creep past toes.  Simultaneously raise arms to shoulder height in front of body, palms down. Hold for 2 seconds, then return to starting position.  After 20 reps, pulse at the bottom for 20 seconds.    Hip-Lift Progression  This is an awesome way to relieve tension in your lower back and work your butt at the same time. (A cushy mat will keep your tailbone from crying afterward.)  Lie on your back with your arms at your sides with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.  Lift your hips toward the ceiling. Hold for 1 count, and then lower back down.  Repeat the lifts for 60 seconds, squeezing your glutes and hamstrings at the top of the range of motion. Be careful not to overarch your spine.  To make this exercise more difficult, extend one leg at the top of the lift. Keep your thighs parallel and hold the lifted position for about 5 seconds.  Keeping your hips up, place your foot back on the floor and then lower your hips.  Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds; switch sides and do the move for another 30 seconds on the other     Dumbbell Squats  A simple way to kick off even a quickie workout, these squats are powerful little moves. Over time, increase reps and dumbbell weight to amp them up.  Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and 8- to 10-pound dumbbells by your thighs.  Squat down as if you were going to sit in a chair, keeping your weight over your heels.  Squeeze your glutes as you return to the start position.  Do 15-20 reps.  As you continue, keep the weight in your heels, making sure your knees do not past forward of your toes.  For a bigger challenge, try it without the weights, jump explosively, and land in the squat position.    Legs  do lots of squats. also do leg lifts on your side and your back (lay on your back and SLOWLY lift you legs up and down, if it doesnt hurt, do it a lot slower. shoot for 25 lifts, if it doesnt hurt, go to 50)    arms  Bicep Exercises  Standing Barbell Curls   1. grab your weight with an underhand grip with feet shoulder width apart  2 . allow the weight to hang in front of you, keeping your elbows close to you at all times.   3. moving only your forearms bring the weight into your shoulders.  4. hold for about 5 seconds and then repeat.   Dumbbell Concentration Curls  1. sit on the end of a bench with your legs spread  2. reach down in between your legs and pick up a light weight with one hand.  3. place your elbow on your knee and make sure your arm is fully straight.  4. place your other hand on your other knee so the upper body has some support.  5. using your forearm only bring the weight to your shoulder and hold for a few seconds.   6. repeat and then switch arms  Triceps exercises  Lying Barbell Extentions  1. lie on a workout bench with feet shoulder length apart on each side.  2. grab the weight and hold it above your head with your arms straight.  3. using your forearms only, lower the weigh until it is about one inch above your forehead.  4.then push the weight back to starting position and then repeat.  Tricep Dumbbell Extensions  1. grab a light weight with one hand with feet shoulder length apart  2. lift the weight so your arms are straight above your head  3. slowly lower the weight behind your head  4. then slowing lift the weight again above your head until your in the starting position.  5. repeat for one set of 10 times and then do the same for the other arm.  Forearm exercises  Barbell Wrist Curls  1. grab a weight with your wrists facing down.   2. sit on a wor

5f5bdda9f22a52bc94cd6a38f328275daa	A stone probably lodged itself in the muscle tissue at the bottom of your bladder that controls urination... there is a lot of blood flow in that area, and if the stone broke a blood vessel inside your bladder that's exactly what would happen.  You can't really do anything on your own to "fix it"... if you're lucky it might just clot over on its own and go away, but if you're still peeing blood after 2 or 3 more bathroom trips, then you really need to see a doctor because something could be causing permanent damage.|`|F0gqCh2waa	Mostly due to kidney stone.|`|Y6UvevPGaa	mostly it is stone passed to your u.b. &stayed there

mG2lZRrXaa	You need to go to a doctor to get your ear cleaned out. It can be done at home, but requires a syringe and proper  instruction.|`|K28Qo2ZVaa	you are an idiot.  you probably damaged your eardrum with the pen.
zSkC7hsGaa	You can't really spot reduce fat. what you can do is exercise these areas to tighten up the muscle which will give you a smaller appearance.   Some good exercises are squats, and walking lunges.  Squats place your feet about shoulder with apart squat down til your upper leg is almost at a 90% bend, try not to bend forward to much keep a nice straight back, using your butt and thigh muscles rise back to the starting position. Repeat about 10 times if this is easy hold a hand weight or large full bottle of water for more resistance,you can also add more reps, For the walking lunges you need some space, start standing tall feet together, start with either leg and take a lunging step forward. Bring your other leg up to meet it. The with the leg you just brought forward take a lunging step forward, bring the other leg forward to meet it. Do as many as you are able to do.   Both of the exercises will make your legs and butt very sore, that means it's working. Do the exercises every other day, if you are extremely sore do them every 3rd day.    This plan and good nutrition will have you looking better soon.|`|QCTy1iaEaa	Most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles. Also, you can have the strongest gluts in the world, but if they're hidden under a layer of fat (and cellulite), nobody will see them. So you need to get rid of fat too (which takes care of cellulite as well). Look for specific butt workouts, i.e. http://www.firmbuttexercises.com/workout... and others.|`|kXbpzGRraa	well the best way is to do enough sports and maintain a good diet.

AA11614449	GOOD GRIEF...if 21 is old then that makes me ancient for being 25...gee thanks...lol    Seriously though do you have bad posture? Are you keeping up with the exercises the doctor gave you? Are you working out too hard? I think the best thing is to continue the exercises from your doctor but to also see a masseuse.  Some work with insurances which is helpful so you should look into that.  It really helps to relieve pain.    Also to expand on what Luke said. Some massage therapist work with chiropractors and some chiropractors could refer you to a masseuse.  I'd honestly prefer the massage than to having my back cracked and such, my friends who have been in car accidents go see chiropractors and it doesn't sound comfortable. But what ever works for you =)    lol...i know the age thing was a joke.  I have a similar problem with my back my doctor said i have a slight bend in my spine and it doesn't help that i slouch a lot.  I may be tall but standing next to my friends i look shorter.  The massage therpy really helps when my back starts to hurt.  Your pain is probably from both your age and posture.  If you look kids younger than us dinosaurs lol...like elementary children lol...they stand up straight but as we get older we either get lazy or tired or whatever and start slouching.|`|Me6WL4dSaa	MAN...UR 21....AND U SAY U R OLD??? R U F**KIN CRAZY...          first get  your head checked dude...coz u r the first person who says"im 21 and im old" and im at a "advancing age"|`|BhNBRSwYaa	Hey Luke, sorry about your troubles. Maybe I can help. I've had all kinds of issues with my back, so my advice to you would be to try the exercises the doctor gave you. If it's atrophy (the wasting away of muscles) then you'll need those exercises to rebuild the muscle in your shoulder. Also try to place a hot water bottle on the point of pain each night. That generally helps. I would however consult a physical therapist. I did that and it turns out that I have over a hundred knots in my back, due to bad posture. She used acupunture on me, which had amazing results. But till then, I'd recommend some stretching exercises and the hot water bottle.  Good luck!|`|vsQBW5jaaa	Oi Mazza I'd shut up, this is a serious problem and if hes had it for over 5 years then its serious.    Don't Listen to him buddy, Have you considered a Chiropractor? They will be able to tell you whether its due to growing pains or bad posture, what height are you and what weight? Height and Weight may have something to do with it aswell? Click on my 360 and email me what height you are, if your a private person dont worry about weight but the best bet is a chiropractor.
HosRSAnVaa	hey it depends on when you wanna take it.Your suppose to take it the first day you got your period..I have taken it after it and didn't affect me at all.. So if you don't want to wait just start at a day that's good for you...Make sure you take the pill everyday at the same time or it generally will mess up.|`|hvCDrY3eaa	im on the patch and it says the same time except i have to change the patch every sunday. but i would wait until sunday and take it. but i would definatly make sure to take it on sunday. makes things easier. if you have any trouble i would contact your dr.

WkcPWmR9aa	of course it is bad, because of its nicotine content that causes blood vessel constriction that causes high blood pressure and its contribution to lung diseases. Read this article to know info's for smoking related diseases. http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/lung...|`|8WP9Gu1saa	Old folks who take tobacco raw claimed their lungs are healthy and it also helps with their digestion.  They either chew the tobacco or smoke them wrapped in a bigger tobacco leaf. We therefore conclude that what makes smoking bad for the body is not in the tobacco but something else added to the tobacco, like the rolling paper and filters. The chemical reaction of burning this two components, produce a by product which is bad for the lungs. You can research on this to verify.

Dy11NInPaa	External hemorrhoids are usually not that large, so usually will resolve on their own without much trouble; they usually reduce on their own. The one you are describing is really large, and I cannot imaging you even being able to walk normally let alone sit; it must be very painful! I do think you should see a doctor soon, if you can, to see what he/she would recommend. It could rupture and cause a lot of bleeding, which would probably stop on it's own and be done + over. But if it doesn't, maybe a doctor could recommend some treatment to shrink it to a more bearable size so it does not feel so horrendous that it is interfering with your life!|`|PtqN5WM3aa	At that size, you are in danger of it rupturing.

What many people don't realize is that this cannot just be done overnight! If you try to make drastic changes in your diet too quickly, chances are that you will only be frustrated and disappointed with your loosing that belly fat.    Also, there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise. In this article I will give two great Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat.     1. Avoid self-sabotaging train of thoughts: Self-sabotaging thoughts will do you more harm than think. Just imagine, if you always think that you cannot do the things you need to do in order to lose weight, how can you ever loose that belly fat? If you think that you cannot do sit-ups and push-ups, you are probably jumping to conclusions and being too overly self-crital even before you have tried any exercises! If you think that doing thirty push-ups is too much for you, then start small. Start with 10-15 push-ups, and thank yourself once you have done it successfully! Then try to add one or two extra push-ups every day to your routine until you reach your target of thirty.     You see, when you start small, it becomes much easier to reach your goals! Instead of thinking too much about it, just take action and DO it! The amount of time you spend on thinking and criticizing yourself, you may as well as spend it on some exercise. While the former will do you no good, the latter will help you burn fat and loose that belly fat fast!     2. Get help & support: Proper support is important in order to keep you on point and motivated. Without support, you won't be able to lose weight successfully. That is why it is essential that you enlist the support of your friends and family who understand you and support your goals. It is also essential that you choose a weight loss program which offers support to its members in the form of a support group or forum. In a forum, you will get support and tips from your peers and experts alike! Surround yourself with supportive people and stay away from the negative people who can only find faults with you!     If you follow these Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat there is no reason why you won't be able to lose that belly fat! Remember that you can achieve whatever you believe or think in your mind. If you believe you can loose belly fat fast, then you WILL! I know that this sounds very much like The Secret and The Law of Attraction but it is very true!         http://www.newadvice4u.com/howto/loosebe...|`|zHYro8rnaa	Weight Watchers is great, I have lost alot of weight doing their diet. I was never hungry on this either which I loved.    Good Luck!|`|Ipnnj07uaa	losing weight simple math.......burn more than u consume but difficult to do. here are some tips i use all the time to lose weight.........whenever i put on back.....other than the usual knowledge of no sweets fried etc cut out carbs-carbohydrates completely for a month and u'll have drastic weight loss this is tough to do. the finish dinner by 7pm no cooked food after 7. rest start some exercise look up youtube for free exercising vedios they are helpful. hope this helps|`|AWm2zhyLaa	For a diet you could try keeping like a food journal of everything you eat and the number of calories. Dont let your calorie intake exceed 1500. It sounds kinda hard but its really not, i did this for 3 months and lost 30 pounds with minimal exercise. And for exercise at the office you could buy one of those large balancing exercise balls and sit on that instead of your office chair. This will force you to balance yourself and it will work your whole core without actually feeling like your exexercising|`|jfhP8PCIaa	I know how you feel, I work as a dispatcher and go through the same thing. Here are some tips to help you out.     1.) First thing you can do to help you out is stretch often between periods and whenever you feel like you muscles are getting stiff.    2.) I have carried dumbells to work and done some curls when no one was around but you can always get by with some heavy books.     3.) You always have time to workout your legs. Lunges and squats can always be done in the office and will get your legs and butt in shape. Another good one is calf raise ( done my standing on the tips of your toes and causing yourself to go up and down several times.)    4.) And last you can alter your yoga workouts to do them from the chair like a half sun position and various other position.     I hope a few of these help.

hvCDrY3eaa	It just depends. my sister got hpv and she had a miscarriage. she hasnt tried again. but it just depends what your dr says. and everything ive heard and read you can get rid of hpv. take vitamin c and try to eat healthy etc. and eventually ur immune system will fight it off. depending what kind of hpv you have though u have to be very careful. like if you have genital warts it useually is a mild case of hpv if that makes sense basically you are less likely to get cancer from it. but if you dont have the genital warts and do have hpv you have a higher chance of getting cervical cancer. just make sure you go to the dr. and you get your check ups regularly. it can be very serious. and it is possible you can have children but the best way to know for sure is ask your dr. they should no whats going on with your body. i wish you the best of luck with it. i hope this helped.|`|whKNYi4waa	stippers with hpv shouldn't get pregnate.
PtqN5WM3aa	You can try St Johns Wort tablets, which are plant based. You must still use them with caution and only the recommended dose suggested.    If you are suffering from clinical depression, you need to get antidepressants. Why don't you want to see a doctor? Only someone qualified in mental health issues can tell you if you actually need antidepressants. You can't just take them because you feel a bit fed up. Depression is accompanied by specific symptoms. You can't just take a pill and expect to feel great. The treatment of depression requires that the patient be closely monitored, sometimes counselling in necessary, sometimes lifestyle changes are indicated and a doctor MUST see the patient on a regular basis.    Antidepressants arent something to take lightly, they alter your brain chemistry and behaviours. If you take them when you dont need them, you can cause yourself mental health problems.    There are a HUGE amount of different pills on the market. Some work on some people and not on others. All have side effects. All must be monitored.    Go to a doctor.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	I think in all countries you need a prescription for anti-depressant drugs because it should not be taken abruptly due to its many side effects  http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/anti...|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Not legal.  There is good reason that you need a prescriptions to get them.

Have you ever tried  self hypnosis for relaxation. or meditation, even Yoga.  Theirs not much you can do about what's going on in your head..  but you can try to control it.  I sure after March.or April The grinding will slow or stop.  In the mean time work on the stress. and ask your Dentist about a tooth Gard.  Good luck.|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	Everybody handles excess stress differently. Some people develop an ulcer, some people develop high blood pressure, and some people grind or clench their teeth.    Stress, it's now believed, is the major cause of grinding and clenching your teeth, say dental researchers. In the past, a malocclusion (the way your teeth fit together) got the blame, and dentists would grind the teeth down, trying to readjust the bite.    In a small percentage of cases, sleep patterns are responsible. The reasons children grind remain unclear.    The problem with bruxism, as the habit of grinding and clenching is called, is the wear and tear on your teeth. When you grind your teeth, you can wear away tooth enamel. This can lead to sensitive teeth and tooth decay, and it can also cause damage to expensive dental work. Finally, grinding taxes the muscles and joints of the temporomandibular (jaw). Prolonged grinding may damage the jaw joint enough to cause osteoarthritis as well as bone loss in periodontal (gum) disease, although it does not actually cause gum disease.    Teeth-grinding is thought to be hereditary. It's also related to gender: Three times as many women as men grind their teeth. Bruxism is most common in those between 20 and 40 years of age.    Ironically, the regular grinder may do less harm than the intermittent grinder--sort of like the weekend athlete who's not in shape for intense activity. The regular grinder can wear down teeth, but his or her muscles get stronger from the habit.    Clenching may do more harm than grinding because, although your jaw is designed for chewing, it is not designed for clenching. As a result, clenching can cause degeneration in the joint.    People who grind are usually aware of their habit, too. They wake up with a stiff or tired jaw, or their spouse hears the noise during the night. Clenchers, on the other hand, may be ignorant of their problem. Some people clench all day and don't realize it, although they do find that they have jaw pain that increases throughout the day.    TIPS FOR TEETH GRINDERS!    Here's what you can do to try to stop bruxing and to cope with discomfort until you do:    Wear a night guard. Your dentist can make a plastic or acrylic appliance for you to wear at night. Although it may not stop you from grinding, it will redistribute the forces from grinding and protect your teeth from damage. Your dentist will want to see you regularly to check for any tooth movement or cavities that might result from wearing such an appliance. Keep in mind, however, that in order for the night guard to do any good, you must remember to put it in.    Keep your lips sealed, but your teeth apart. Your teeth should be touching only when you're chewing or swallowing. Drop your jaw and feel the muscles relax -- then try to maintain that feeling.    Take a warm bath before bedtime. The warmth of the water may temporarily relax your jaw muscles.
D0hxU89Laa	I've had similar problems before! First of all, I wouldn't put salty water in your belly button! It may be too harsh and dry it out. Does it itch at all? If if itches it could be infected or if it's red or burning. Don't pick at it and rinse it out gently with warm soapy water and then rinse it completly with clear water to make sure there is no residue left in there and pat it dry gently with a soft cloth and try to keep it aired out and dry. It may be from an infection or a build up in there or something sharp and scratchy got in there like a potato chip peice (i've had that happen) lol..or it could be that you have a certain pair of pants with a rough spot that rubs that area. If it doesn't go away I would go see a doctor! Take Care! :)|`|EsVjwKPAaa	must see a doctor!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Yeah, but it would be unhealthy and you wouldn't feel good about yourself. If you want to lose weight, you need to make it a part of your lifestyle. You can't define it as a diet, but as a change of lifestyle. Getting healthy means eating health. www.sparkpeople.com gives you healthy meal plans, and many support groups. Good Luck. ??|`|5UJSX3vJaa	nope   you'll gain weight   your metabolism will slow down and you'll get sluggish   the body will start conserving fat cause it thinks its in famine times   you want to eat 5 small meals a day to keep that metabolism fired up too lose weight|`|JsffWlnEaa	no.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Well, try this one hope it helps.Get rid of excess weight American dieticians recommend using the "water" diet, which is becoming increasingly popular in the West.

Breakfast -oatmeal etc, snack -apple ,  lunch- a sandwich,snack-apple yogurt or banana, dinner- a salad etc. This method boosts your metabolism and therefore burns more calories which leads to healthy long lasting weight loss. Good Luck|`|x0J8S5sWaa	Techically, yes, for a short time (unless its a HUGE three course meal). But you will be starving in between which sends your body into a mode where it starts to hold on to any calories that you do consume...so it's more likely that if you gain any of the weight back, it will come back as pure fat. Why don't you eat several healthy small meals everyday? A yoghurt for breakfast, a salad and sandwich for lunch, a yoghurt for a snack and some fish fillet for dinner?     Don't start a diet you can't imagine yourself doing the rest of your life. Because a diet is supposed to be a lifestyle change if you want to keep the pounds off. And quite frankly can you imagine eating only one meal a day? Not unless you eat other things too....So instead eat more often and you will lose weight slower, but keep it off. Goodluck :)|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	for the first week maybe, but youll gain the weight back really fast when you start eating properly.     your body needs a certain no. of calories a day. you can compare it to a car needing fuel. if a car had to run for 24 hours, it would need a certain amount of fuel, depending on its fuel mileage right?   your body needs approximately 13 times your body weight in pounds in calories.   so if you weigh 100lbs you need 100 x 13 -> 1300 calories a day.  if you eat less calories than that your body will burn muscles, fat, tissue, and protein to make up for the calorie deficiency, causing you to lose weight.   if your eating 1 small cube of cheese with 50 calories for your one meal, your body will burn 1250 calories worth of your body tissue to make up. 3500 calories = 1 lbs, so if you burn 1250 calories a day x 7 days a week youll lose a bit more than 2lbs a week. the x13 is pretty rough, and the amount of calories you really need depends a lot on your age/sex/height/average heart rate/ medical condition/ physical condition.     if you eat only once a day, your body will think your starving, and theres not enough food, and start decreasing the amount of calories it burns, saving more for the future by slowing down your metabolism. so if you eat a cube of cheese a day for two weeks, youll lose less weight the 2nd week.   having a slow metabolism also means, when you do start eating normally again youll put on weight very fast.     Eat 2-3 hours, instead of once every 24 hours.   eat small portions  try to avoid anything you think falls under the category "junk food"  dont drink energy drinks and any liquid with over 0 calories.   try to eat little high starch/carbohydrate things like rice or pasta.   exercise(walk/jog or join a gym) otherwise youll get loose skin and saggy flab  Eat lean meats with protein like tuna.   Eat cheese! not lots, but cheese is good.   Calcium/vitamins/iron, dont count as calories. eat enough of these.   Eat green leafy vegetables.  try eating fruits and vegetables with every eating.   dont starve yourself.   dont stuff yourself.

ovi4hOpiaa	your Systolic number is pretty low (thats your top number) and your Diastolic number kinda low. Normal blood pressure is usually in the range of 120/80 (systolic/diastolic). Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure (less than 90/60).Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But health problems occur when blood pressure drops suddenly, and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. I would say go to you doctor and have them monitor that.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	you are hypotensive.|`|JbXUtNYvaa	The higher (systolic) number represents the pressure while the heart contracts to pump blood to the body.      The lower (diastolic) number represents the pressure when the heart relaxes between beats.     The systolic pressure is always stated first. For example: 118/76 (118 over 76); systolic = 118, diastolic = 76.     Blood pressure below 120 over 80 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) is considered optimal for adults. A systolic pressure of 120 to 139 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 89 mmHg is considered "prehypertension" and needs to be watched carefully. A blood pressure reading of 140 over 90 or higher is considered elevated (high).|`|AA11589437	It is low, which is good because it is dangerous to have a high blood pressure, but it is possible that sometimes you may feel dizzy or exhausted.  If so, drink an orange juice, some coffee or add some salt to your food.|`|bf3d5b101e23e11f80c328b6cdb9ec93aa	Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure (less than 90/60) with no symptoms.    A blood pressure reading appears as two numbers. The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood. The second number measures diastolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats.    Normal blood pressure is usually in the range of 120/80 (systolic/diastolic). In healthy people, especially athletes, low blood pressure is a sign of good cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) health. But low blood pressure can be a sign of an underlying problem -- especially in the elderly -- where it may cause inadequate blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs.    Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But health problems occur when blood pressure drops suddenly, and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness. Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone who's rising from a prone or sitting position to standing. This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, or neurally mediated orthostatic hypotension.    The cause of low blood pressure isn't always clear. It may be associated with the following:    Pregnancy   Hormonal problems such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)   Over-the-counter medications   Overdose of high blood pressure drugs   Heart failure   Heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)   Widening, or dilation, of the blood vessels   Heat exhaustion or heat stroke   Liver disease|`|ZB0393Kkaa	Means your blood pressure is too low.     The 80 (systolic blood pressure) is the force the blood is exerting on your blood vessels when your heart contracts, and the 60 (diastolic) is when the heart relaxes.     Your bottom number is OK. Ideally, that top number should be between 100 and 120. How much salt do you consume? Consider upping your intake. Having low blood pressure can cause dizziness and fainting.

7RFRGDL6aa	4 months with lots of cardio, maybe even 3|`|kXq90b09aa	You need seriuos fat burning to lose 4 pant sizes,   The best way to lose fat is doing interval training! like jogging for 2 mins and brisk walking for 2 mins and you can also sprint for 2 mins or less..this is an interesting workout and better for your health in every way! Another effective way of doing interval training is sprint for 30 secs to 1 min, rest for 3-5 mins and do it again, repeat this 4 times in one session. Note that interval training should be done only 3-4 times a week (3 sessions the best) and you will lose fat drastically.    watch these for more info    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIupxbukU...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym7d2MzZ9...

Height of person depends on many factors and "hereditary" is important feature which means you inherit some features of your parents and i think you inherit height from your parents.Masturbation has nothing to do with your growth, it is a healthy activity.Your hair start growing means you r now able to reproduce i.e u got sexual maturity, some people have less hairs and some have more (even on shoulders or back), it is also normal.Diet also play good role in growth.Calculate your BMI.  Many of my good friends r of your height, it is normal.  (I'm 25 now and i am masturbating from the age of 15-16 and i hav'nt find any negative effect of masturbation on my height (5'8").

A diet rich in vitamin A & minerals is a better treatment for sinus drainage. Vitamins condition the mucus membranes in your head & throat for greater immunity.
AA11614449	Between the two months it's not a large change.  However in some cases HIV can't be ruled out completely if in the past 3 months you have had any hiv risk behavior.  Your body can take several months after your are infected to make hiv antibodies.  if you became infected only recently there may not have been enough time to develop antibodies that can be detected.  You should consider getting tested again in 3 to 6 months to be sure you are not infected.      If you had not been in hiv risk behavior in the three months before your test than a negative test means you weren't infected.      If you have any questions, ask your health care provider or you can call the National AIDS hotline at 1-800-342-AIDS to talk with an HIV specialist.  They can give you quick and private answers any time day or night.

QY7GVVLzaa	You need to make a paste by mixing up Sandalwood with a few drops of Rosewater. Note that Sandalwood and rosewater blend can be used as facial mask and cab can be instantly applied on the acne areas of skin. Yes, lets continue with the paste of Sandalwood and rosewater. When the paste is done leave it for some hours. Then apply it during the night before going to bed. The next morning when you wake up just wash thoroughly your face with warm water (which help to open pores). You will be amazed by the softness of your skin and feel a sort of cool and comfort on your acne areas. Repeating the same action frequently in a week will bring positive results to your acne condition.

If you have sex regularly with your wife or a single partner the only danger is her becoming pregnant and   B. If you have it regularly with unknown women as an addict, there is every possibility of your suffering with AIDs and other STDs, appart from loosing your morale.     Otherwise it has innumerable benefits if you have regularly as under -     1. According to British Medical Journal, chemicals released during intercourse enhance the skin texture.   2. Couples who do sex at least thrice a week are at 50% less risk of getting heart attack. Romantic hormones like testosterone reduce heart attack risk by strengthening heart muscles.   3. Oxytocin which is released during intercourse reduces stress levels in the body. Oxytocin is a trust hormone which strengthens bond between couples.   4. According to one research, speakers who had good sex session at previous night delivered good speeches in the following day. Sex may enhance ones confidence levels.   5. Endorphins released during sex have the capacity to reduce pain in the body.   6. Regular sex increases Immunoglobulin-A levels by 30 times which raises immunity, according to Wilkes University researchers in Pennsylvania.   7. Old couples should do sex or kissing to enhance some hormone levels in the body.   8. During sex, heart beats 80-150 times which is a good exercise to strengthen muscles.   9. One sex session is equal to running for 1 kilometre. Bedroom is the best gym. Burn calories.  10. Prolactin released during sex increases the capacity of smell.   11. Sex reduces breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men.   12. Couples who have good sex life will achieve anything in professional life.

AA11614449	As you ascend and descend there's a build-up of pressure in the inner ear by swallowing the jaw bone pulls and releases that pressure    Found this on wikipedia...EAR  Normally, the Eustachian tube is collapsed, but it gapes open both with swallowing and with positive pressure. When taking off in an airplane, the surrounding air pressure goes from higher (on the ground) to lower (in the sky). The air in the middle ear expands as the plane gains altitude, and pushes its way into the back of the nose and mouth. On the way down, the volume of air in the middle ear shrinks, and a slight vacuum is produced. Active opening of the Eustachian tube is required to equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the surrounding atmosphere as the plane descends. The diver also experiences this change in pressure, but with greater rates of pressure change; active opening of the Eustachian tube is required more frequently as the diver goes deeper into higher pressure.|`|m5aenb6qaa	the swallowing gesture is technically a movement of your tongue and jaw joints at the same time that affects the small joints of your ears. That's why the pressure from the rapid ascent or descent of the airplane is being relieved from this movement. That's what i think.
RFi3w8AIaa	I had similar condition to you. I was extremely weak and short of breath. This got worse & worse over a 3 months. I had gone to doctor several times, and each time they tried me out on different antibiotics. Eventually, they put me through to a consultant. I had an X-ray, which showed shadows on the lung. I then had to have a minor surgery remove and a small part of my lung. The up-shot, was that I was allergic to the pet bird, which I'd been living with for 3 years.

AA12266052	Early treatment often improves the chance of a good outcome. Treatment, however, depends on the size and type of tumor and the general health of the patient. The goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or the person's comfort.  Gliomas are primary tumors that originate in brain parenchyma. Symptoms and diagnosis are similar to those of other brain tumors. Treatment involves surgical excision, radiation therapy, and, for some tumors, chemotherapy. Excision rarely cures.  Meningiomas are benign tumors of the meninges that can compress adjacent brain tissue. Symptoms depend on the tumor's location. Diagnosis is by MRI with contrast agent. Treatment may include excision, stereotactic radiosurgery, and sometimes radiation therapy.  Most pineal region tumors are germ cell tumors.  Most pituitary tumors are adenomas. Symptoms include headache and endocrinopathies; endocrinopathies result when the tumor produces hormones or destroys hormone-producing tissue. Diagnosis is by MRI. Treatment includes correction of any endocrinopathy and surgery, radiation therapy, or dopaminergic agonists.  Primary brain lymphomas originate in neural tissue and are usually B-cell tumors. Diagnosis requires neuroimaging and sometimes CSF analysis (including Epstein-Barr titers,) or brain biopsy. Treatment includes corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.  Spinal cord tumors may develop within the spinal cord parenchyma, directly destroying tissue, or outside the cord parenchyma, often compressing the cord or nerve roots. Symptoms include progressive back pain and neurologic deficits referable to the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots. Diagnosis is by MRI. Treatment may include corticosteroids, surgical excision, and radiation therapy.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Malignent means cancer and if the same is in the initial stage it can be cured or if it is in advanced stage only god can help.|`|QLLAMoZKaa	sure its a long time, the people after surgery must do therapy and many more to be normal they maybe need more than one year to doing all of that things|`|AA12212523	Meningioma patients tend do do well after surgery.

Even thought your LDL is higher it's also within "normal" range as with the rest of your results.      I say "normal" because in different regions "normal" ranges can vary but usally only slightly.  Where I work the TG range is 35 to 200.  All labs will establish a "normal values" for its area.

It does not have to be contracted through sex but sharing a wet towel with some one that has it will be infected as well  ========  TRICHOMONIASIS - This infection is caused by a one-celled protozoan organism. Trichomoniasis is almost always spread through sexual contact. However, the protozoan organism can survive for up to twenty-four hours in a moist environment, making wet towels or bathing suits possible instruments of transmission from someone with the infection.    Signs and Symptoms  Most men and some women don't display any symptoms, which may include:    Yellow/green, frothy, discharge   Foul odor with discharge   Increased amount of discharge   Inflammation of vulva/vagina   Increased frequency of urination   Itching   Treatment: The treatment used is the oral antibiotic, metronidazole. Remember - no alcohol consumption when taking the medication and for 48 hours after treatment! It is recommended that both partners be treated at the same time to avoid recurrent infections. Partners should be treated even if they aren't displaying any symptoms.

There's a lot of people that don't "love" working out, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't do it. I'm assuming at 14, she's probably fairly active at school and such so it's probably not a big deal. Unless she's severely overweight, or has a health issue, she should be okay with normal teenage activity.|`|yVAzOBARaa	it all depends on the amount she gets in her day. if she gets plenty of walking around done and isnt aiming for an athletes physique than its not really necassary, if she is someone who is TV or computer bound then at least a 20 minute workout would be a good idea, pr else there will be a fat build up and strain in the heart, making the problem even worse.      might i reccomend a vibration platform,  you basically stand on them and they shake your body, flexiung the muscles as it does so. 10 minutes on one of these things is the equal of a lot longer running with significantley less drain. They are also benificial for blood circulation.
Pmb0MeB8aa	Well, let me start of by saying the blood pressure change is not enough to be significant. That level of change could happen over the span of seconds and change right back. It's too close to your baseline to be worried about. Even though the diastolic is low, it's still fine. The reason for the diastolic being low is likely because of your heart rate being low. Bradycardia causes a widened pulse pressure. But that's nothing to worry about in and of itself.    My questions to you are:    A) Have you been exercising / are you in good shape? That could explain the decrease in pulse. People who are in good shape have a lower pulse than those who do not.  B) Are you from a place of altitude and are now in a place without altitude? If you are normally from a place of altitude, being at sea level will slow your heart rate just because of the amount of oxygen available in the air.    But even then, a drop of 13 points in heart rate isn't a problem. If you are symptomatic, then worry. But you are probably fine.
MEZ9hoRTaa	That's a Great question actually. I'm glad you brought that up because I always wondered the same myself. I have the same experience you get. After I watch violent hbo series or movies, I get numb to these things. I can be in a subway train, and people are fist fighting next to me and I see it as normal and amusing. Or I can get into a phase of watching lovey dovey romantic movies, and I get very sensitive to others. It's a temporary condition that changes depending on what I've been watching.

Everything you do in life you become a little more "used" to it in order to deal with it whether its your parents fighting or some bully or news crises or even in sports and the likes. The answer is simply yes but unless you have a sheltered life and the movies are something of a major aspect in them then its not going to affect your day to day life much at all.|`|AA10817491	spending time on the computer probably does the same.|`|OUtYUT8daa	Good question.

I cried in Hancock twice... and I also cried in Bolt.  That's horrible. I'm such a sook.|`|Q5KvjRreaa	seriously yes,|`|wSPBwKxHaa	IMO it depends on how a persons brain works.  E.g. - if a person is strong minded then what that person watches wouldn't affect him/her whereas a physical experience might.   But a person who is more open minded and believes in just about anything or believes that just about anything is possible is more likely to be influenced by TV and end up thinking (and maybe even believing) that he/she is stronger    i hope that didn't sound confused and pls note its simply imo (which is not perfect :P )
aIzKbpQGaa	preferably 8hrs sleep is required  8-10 glasses of water  2-3 glasses of milk  any sport would be enough    if u want self protection choose taekwondo, volleyball & hockey are fun.. best of luck|`|615358a36cb2843bd4f068472dcb2e96aa	Hey there:)    Honestly, I think you should learn how to "listen" to your inner voice. Averagely, specialists recommend 7-8 hours of sleep, about 1-1.5 liters  of water daily, a glass of milk will do and about an hour of exercises a day, but when it comes to individual, that may vary greatly, depending on your health condition, habits etc. For example, if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer, you need more exercises, on the other hand, some exercises can harm you if you overdo them. Likewise, if your lifestyle makes you feel tired, you need more sleep, etc.    My suggestion is just do some antropological measurements (take a centimetre and measure your waist, chest, leg), weight and keep doing that monthly, take notes on how you feel after doing certain exercises (increase or decrease their amount and types, correspondingly), stay a bit hungry after meals and move a bit more than you think you can, and you'll be fine :))|`|b8e2bc9f3753405233ebcc96825942cdaa	As long as your not over or under weight then a normal balanced diet should be the required amount of food each day.

xhjSPd0uaa	im so scared of the dentist i hate it,    i went to get my braces yesterday!  i was crying before id even walked in the surgery, i sat in the seat an just thought ive got to do it! grippin hold of my hands n holdin tight waitin for the pain that people have been tellin me about n scarin me with, before i knew it he told me 2 rinse my mouth an handed me a mirror! it took about 10minutes (for my top teeth) so if you were having all your teeth bottom and top it would take about 20 minutes.    i honestly felt NO pain atall, a little pressure just pressing on each tooth as he glued the brackets on, but nothing else. if you think about what he's actually doing, u relise that none of the steps he goes through could actually cause you pain, like if u imagin doin this stuff 2 urself u wouldnt be scared to death! its just the fact hes a dentist that it freaks us out, all he does is slot these metal rings over your back teeth, glue brackets on each tooth, use a type of airblowing machine to set the glue, thread wire through the brackets, and its done.    dont worry seriously it doesnt hurt!    also the pain after which people have been saying is bad, take a painkiller AS SOON AS u can after you've had them fitted, or JUST before. i havent actually needed to take any painkillers!! i havent felt any bad pain atall, although biting down/closing your teeth together does feel kinda weird and can be painful if u do it to hard, but aslong as u make sure your teeth are apart as much as possible then u'll be fine. stick to foods like mash potato, soup, icecream, yogurt etc.      good colours are bright obvious colours which can't be mistaken for food in your teeth eg. baby pink, baby blue, aqua etc.  its probably best to just stick to one colour instead of having a combination, unless ur quite young! and dont go for colours like black, green, yellow.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Only for the first week or so and when you have to go to the dentists and tighten them.|`|xqOWI8VUaa	For the first week or so its kinda hard to eat bcuz it feels really weird to chew and stuff and u will also feel a lil bit of pain.

PUTTING them on certainly isn't, just a bit of pressure on your teeth awhile. For the first few days (less if you're lucky) it'll be rather hard to bite food properly, so stick to food like porridge, or if you're eating anything hard, cut them into bite-size so it'll be easier. After a while it gets better and suddenly you feel like you've been wearing braces all along. :D    The only thing that hurts is if you have to extract teeth, like me. The injection they give really hurts, but after a few minutes it suddenly becomes numb and you don't feel much when they extract your teeth. The numbness lasts a few hours and it's a really weird feeling touching your cheek because you can't feel it. xD But after awhile it'll be okay. =)|`|8UEvryP3aa	People say it does hurt but everyone has different pain tollerance.

They stay pretty sore for 3-7 days then they start to get better. Most people start to like braces when they stop hurting. So if you can bear the pain for 3-7 days you are set!       However, sometimes it feels like your teeth are lose, because they're moving. This goes away too. But I wouldn't say that the pain ever completely *stops* hurting, until your braces are completely off. But the first week is the worst. And getting them tightened.|`|WIurOBbDaa	Putting braces on hurts your teeth for awhile. They ache and you proably won't want to eat anything for awhile...

They did hurt a bit, yes --- and not just in the first week either.  Presumably, braces will hurt a little more when I finally get them, but I regret not getting them for so long.  You can get low-tension braces now, which should hurt a little less (but may not be as good).  Either way, the pain isn't crippling or anything; more like an annoyance.  If you don't get braces, your teeth will probably annoy you at LEAST that much.  Just do it -- you'll get used to them soon enough, and be glad you did.|`|9b2ofseUaa	easy as pie.  uncomfortable but bearable. for the first week your teeth feel as if they are going to fall out but everybody exaggerates when they tell you it hurts heaps|`|7b7kCkbdaa	They hurt for like 5 days.

What I do know is:  You have a 12-hour window with the Cerazette pill (most mini pills are 3 hours) so in theory it will only take 12 hours after your last missed pill before you can possibly get pregnant.  If you are trying to get preganant or combat side effects, simply stop taking the pill.    It could take longer for them to come completely out of your system, as you put it, and it may also depend on how long you've been taking them for.  But as they contain only VERY small amounts of hormones (this is why you need to take one every single day) their effects will wear off very quickly.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Cerezette will be out of your system completely just a couple of days after you take the last pill.

It could be the colon, rectum, or anus commonly, but bright red usually means its closer to the anus.    Hate to break this to you on Yahoo honey but most likely you have hemorrhoids.     So you can breathe, thank goodness its not something worse associated with bloody stool.    BUT! There is always a but...

Bright red color indicates that blood source is very close to your exit, which can happen if you had to strain a little (or even if you had ongoing diarrhea).  Just a tiny tear of one of those vessels could produce blood on your stool.    It should clear itself within a few days if it was just a tiny tear like that.   If it does not, I would go to a physician just to be sure.

They've tested you and you are fine, so you've got nothing to worry about.    I worry sometimes aswell like when I find I can't breathe, it's made worse because I end up thinking something bad but then it's just the worry that is making it worse.

It's true that when you sweat you lose more weight, that weight is not fat, it is water weight, so you're not being healthy by sweating more. It is necessary to keep yourself hydrated.    For some reason people have been conned into thinking fat comes out in sweat or heat helps melt fat away.|`|smA22aNHaa	Cut down on your calorie intake and do the treadmill and you will get the same results.You will have no skin excess, only really big people get that.

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You'd need to drink a lot of full-fat milk to get fat!    Most adults are much better off with low-fat or skim milk, and then only in small amounts.     Remember that fat and carbs in food are sources of energy as well as proteins and vitamins. Eating pasta every day is just as likely to make you fat, particularly if you have a big plateful and use rich, creamy sauces. However, if that pasta is a small portion and served with a little pesto and some tomato sauce, then you will not gain significantly.     The key is moderation. You can have a little of everything that rich, creamy, supposedly fattening, but not every day - save the cakes and sweets and creamy things for special occasions, and fill up on fruit and vegetables, and you should be fine with regular exercise.|`|spXPpyP0aa	CALICIUM|`|V3UsTvUsaa	Calcium, it makes your bones strong, and provides you with protein.|`|x0flaLfUaa	Calcium|`|cLGVSuFqaa	contains calcium  makes bones stornger  helping prevent brittle bones when your old|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	full fat or 2% milk has fat and will make you fat, but its healthy fat, and its better than drinking the same amount of cola. theres aroung 680calories every 1 litre of milk, so unless you binge on milk you wont get obese.     milk contains calcium which makes your bones stronger, and proteins which build muscles. it also contains vitamins, useful amts of A, B and C are in milk .   there are also some useful minerals in milk.     there are indian bodybuilders who drink milk all the time, they drink milk when they wake up, before the work out, after they work out, for lunch, for dinner, and throughout the day. and these guys look like the average bodybuilder, super toned, slim and muscular.|`|kTah0zr8aa	milk itself doesn't make you fat.  You can buy skim or 2% milk which has all the vitamins you need and drink a glass a day. 2% obviously has a little more fat and calories, but some people prefer the taste to skim.  Full milk has a lot more fat and calories and is less healthy.  they all have essential vitamins the body needs.  it is also good for your bones and teeth.  Of course, adding chocolate syrup and sugar makes it more fattening.    like with all foods, moderation is important|`|fDCY1iX7aa	you don't need milk... where do you think cows get their calcium from?

BG8vMyZjaa	Acute urticaria - if it develops suddenly and lasts less than six weeks. Most cases last 24-48 hours. About 1 in 6 people will have at least one bout of urticaria in their life. It can affect anyone at any age. Some people have recurring bouts of acute urticaria.  Often no treatment is necessary as the rash commonly goes within 24-48 hours.   A cool bath or shower may ease the itch.  Antihistamine tablets can ease symptoms. Antihistamines block the action of histamine which is involved in causing urticaria. You can get antihistamines on prescription. You can also buy them from pharmacies. There are several brands.

AA10046040	An alternate birth control method that does not use hormones is called the ParaGard IUD.  Instead of hormones, ParaGard contains copper, which kills sperm.  It  provides protection for 10 years.  ParaGard may lower your risk of developing, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancers, though experts aren't sure why.  Also, ParaGard may be used if you're breast feeding or if you can't tolerate side effects from hormonal methods.  The cost is $362.50 plus about $150 for insertion; covered by most insurance.  If you're paying cash, that works out to $51.25 a year.|`|AA12331419	Change your Doctor there is no reason why you should have went through three different pills.  there are a lot of low harmone pills that you could try

They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.If you still havent got your surgery done,you are better off getting it done in India.      my cousin got a surgery for gallbladder through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company.She is more than very happy with the results.she just paid 30% of the amoun she was quoted in USA.hope this helps.     http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com|`|058fccad806b9d6b038ff96ff622962faa	I had my gall bladder removed about 10 years ago.

AA10046040	NorQD is a progesterone only contraceptive pill, also known as the "Mini-Pill".  It is usually prescribed for women who want a birth control method while breast feeding.  These pills are taken continuously with no gaps in between packs.  You may have irregular bleeding in the first few months of starting, but things should settle into a regular pattern over time.  The way the progesterone only pill works is that it thins out the lining of the uterus, and thickens mucus, theoretically preventing a fertilized egg from implanting.   No birth control method is 100% effective, except for something called Implanon, that is not yet available, but should be later on this year.   It was found to be  100% effective in clinical trials.  It is an implant inserted into your upper arm (it is only a single matchsticklike implant) and is good for up to 3 years.|`|AA12196059	see this web site its a .pdf file need adobe reader its free download it you don't have
AA10046040	The Doubling Rule.  Doctors can also perform quantitative serum beta hCG levels. The measurement is done in mIU/ml, and a level above 25 mIU/ml usually indicates the presence of a pregnancy. Two tests are usually necessary to verify a normal increase, usually 2-3 days apart. The increase in serum hCG can be interactively monitored. Below an hCG level of 1,200 mIU/ml the hCG usually doubles every 48-72 hours, though a rise of 50-60% is still considered normal. Between 1,200 and 6,000 mIU/ml serum the hCG usually takes 72-96 hours to double, and above 6,000 mIU/ml, the hCG often takes more than four days to double. Failure to increase normally may indicate that the pregnancy is not developing well and can be an early sign for a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.

AA10046040	Contrary to what 2LTgrl51 says, it is possible for ovulation to take place more than once a month.  I have worked in the OB/GYN field for more than 18 years, and I can tell you of many instances where this has happened, such as, fraternal twins, etc.  Every woman does not have "textbook" periods and ovulation, and if she did, there would be no use for any birth control method because you could accurately predict when ovulation was occurring.  Whether it is "normal" or not, I would say that it can be "normal" if it is normal for that person.|`|AA10231661	Women only can ovulate for 7 days out of the 28 days of every month.

If those were the answer, then I don't think we would still be the fattest country in the world...    I would suggest about an hour or more of aerobic exercise every day.  whether it is walking, jogging, biking, jumping rope, anything that gets your heart beating and burns some good ol' calories.    For diet, I would say take smaller portions, and stay away from high fat foods and sweets.

He went to the doctor, and they told him that if he would come a week later, they wouldnt be able to save his foot. They put him on some kind of meds. The infection went away after about a month.

AA12371941	So I calculated your BMI using 6'0" and 250 lbs and you're actually obese (unless you've got bodybuilder muscles and really big bones). Your body mass index (which is a height-weight ratio to determine if you're at the right weight) is 33.9. A healthy BMI is that from 19-25. You're at the 94th percentile which means you weigh more than almost every female that is your age and height. According to http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht... you should be around 140-184 lbs.    If you're looking to lose weight, I suggest this routine (which I just posted awhile ago) which helped my brother tone up for his many sport activities.  - wake up at 7 am  - eat fruit for breakfast  - lift weights (just little dumbells)  - go bicycling  - eat a TLC sandwich for lunch (that's tomato lettuce cheese between 2 slices of whole-wheat bread)  - go swim laps  - eat a salad (lots of vegetables and fruits plus fish and olive oil) for dinner  - sleep at 9pm (don't stay up past 11pm)|`|AA12234666	Absolute weight gives no indication about your health, fitness or body composition.

AA11371841	Actually, the only way to know is to ask. There are no foolproof ways to tell if someone is cheating. Even an "eyewitness" might have the situation all wrong!    Some people in similar situations find that confronting the person and being upfront with their feelings is the best way to sort things out. You may want to explain how you feel and ask him how he feels about the situation. One thing to keep in mind when talking about cheating  especially when you're not sure if it's true  is to avoid sounding like you're making an accusation. For instance, instead of saying "You're cheating on me, aren't you?" you can say something like, "I've got this funny feeling. I hope it's not true."    Remember, any time you confront or discuss your feelings with somebody you are taking a risk. You may feel vulnerable or may get hurt in the process, so you need to decide whether knowing the truth is worth the risk.    Hope this information helps!|`|AA12261175	If you have been around men enough, they are easy to read- this is a benefit and a detriment.

Also watch body language...all of this will tell you more than what he says with his actual words.  ps.  If you think he's cheating, he probably is.

Vielleicht Kontrollzwang. berintensives erfassen und bestimmen der Umgebung durch, fr die Umwelt, kaum nachvollziehbare Aktionen und Gewohnheiten. Das Umfeld so faszinieren mit Eigenart, da? nahezu jeder darauf aufmerksam wird.  Die sanfteste Basisform dazu w?re der Husten, der die Umgebung anbellt "Sieh mich an".  Andere Zw?nge wie z.B. ein Kontrollzwang, der sich auf Dinge bezieht ("ist der Herd ausgestellt, ich sehe lieber noch mal nach" und das 400x) sind eher auf die darunter leidende Person selbst bezogen.  Tourette richtet sich zumeist an das Umfeld und kann auch pl?tzlich ganz wegbleiben, wenn die Person in einer Verantwortung ist (Auto lenken z.B.)  Allerdings , und das ist dann die k?rperlich schmerzhafte Seite des Tourette, gibt es Menschen die sich mit diesem Syndrom krankhaft selbst sehr schwer verletzen.  Anders als beim Borderline-Syndrom ist der Betroffene sehr erschrocken und betroffen von seinem Tun, da er meint keine Kontrolle ber sein Handeln zu haben.  Ich sage "meint", weil ich denke da? auch hier die Seele der Grund fr das Dilemma ist und Tourette durchaus heilbar ist. Was eine Tourette-Betroffene/r tats?chlich sagen will ist leider bislang unbekannt.

Adn best ways to fix those are to mentally just damn fix them, personally. It's hard though. And from what I can see, not many people seem to have an intelligent enough brain to solve their own problems. But on the other hand, some sleep problems are health problems. Sure, we can fix those, (seriously we ****** can people!), but takin a drug to subside it so sleeping is possible in order to relax and rejuvinate, is good.

Not that there is anything wrong with thinking and dreaming.  Too much t.v. and distractions are killing imagination and innovation in America.

The pharmaceutical company or distributor providing your therapy[not the pharmacy] should be having a specialized nurse calling you every week or so especially considering your recent diagnosis, to see how you are tolerating and to help you learn coping methods while waiting for your next neuro. appt..  Do you take the inj. right before going to bed?  That may help by letting you sleep through the most yucky feeling part.  Also try to take acetamenephin[Tylenol] or ibuprofen[Advil] 30 minutes before dosing.  Keep your dr. appts. and tell them everything you find disturbing about this, even keep a list of '??'s you want to ask.  Doc may be able to try a different scrip if this one doesn't work out.

7b767b31cd85296c1287f76336242fdeaa	Retrograde bleeding is the backward flow of menstrual discharge through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis, which occasionally occurs during a woman's period     Retrograde blood flow in menstruating women has been described recently. The acute event seems to be asymptomatic. Reported here is a case of an acute abdominal condition due to cervical obstruction and retrograde bleeding in a postmenopausal patient treated with estrogen-progestogen therapy.|`|AA10046040	I believe what you mean is "retrograde" bleeding.  The definition of retrograde is: Movement opposite of intended motion; directed backwards.  So if you apply that definition to bleeding, then it could pertain to an artery or vein.  There are many examples of retrograde bleeding, too numerous to mention here.

AA11533792	Can't say how long if we don't know the other essential parts of your routine.      The most abdominal muscle groups that need to be targeted that I've heard is five: lower, upper, obliques, back (they connect to your frontal abs too), and transverse abdominis.   Are you working them all, if not most?      Also, to prevent plateaus, are you keeping your muscles challenged by increasing the intensity of the ab workouts (beginner, intermediate, advanced) everytime you feel that the workouts are too easy to do?       I've heard that triathlete/expert Lokelani McMichael believes that a person may not being doing enough or intense enough cardio to burn the fat that covers the muscle to show definition.. Sure, your abs are getting stronger and overall better  as time passes by and your heart rate increases, but you could do vigorous cardio at 85-86 percent of your max heart rate: 220 minus your age. OR, do interval training.    Also, watch your calories and alcohol intake (as this can attract fat to your abs).|`|AA12371334	it really depends on how strenuous your workouts are, what your diet is, and how your weight was before you started. i recommend doing 50 crunches every day, and throwing in some side crunches while your at it.|`|35f86cb5036a6b629894faae24a053e2aa	Two weeks, maybe even a week if you combine it with healthy eating style like macrobiotics or whatever works for you, and does not involve 'white deaths'.

In three years you will be wondering how to keep off weight. Look around at your family if everyone is thin, then that is how you are going to be. If they  are overweight...you are going to put on weight soon.   Mastrubation doesn't stunt growth in anyone, neither does it reduce weight.   Eat healthy and excercise. Eat more proteins, less carbohydrate. Never miss meals. And you should be fine.|`|AA11048093	Being 19 and having a high sex drive is normal.  You can't get sick because you masturbate too much.    To gain weight you need to eat plenty of fruit and veg as well as protein and carbohydrate.  Junk food doesn't help.  Eating sugary food when you are hungry is bad too as it can depress your appetite.    Try to get into a routine of eating good healthy meals.  They don't have to be complicated, just make sure you have protein (meat, fish, beans) carbohydrate (potatoes, bread, pasta, rice) and vegetables with every meal.  Start the day with a good breakfast: cereal with whole milk or toast and peanut butter.    Try to cut out sugary food and have healthy snacks when you are hungry (toast, cereal, bread and cheese).|`|f0c2248ad25ec076c98d48144c7d0789aa	I believe 50 kg is like, 80 pounds? augh, I can't remember.  :: bangs head on desk ::  if your worried about weight, eat steak three times a week, and tacos, burritos, treat yourself to fast food once a month. start working out, build muscle, go to a gym.  and the only masturbation is going to effect will be your soldier count and your forearm muscles. so if that doesn't sound so bad, cheer up and enjoy.|`|7684a7ed9de7f8216af5dd5ef8524cffaa	Find a moderate protein, moderate low glycemic carb, moderate good fat diet and stay on it for about 1 month.  If you don't see your weight increasing, then your body is happy with your current weight, given your exercise level.    Then, after the month, if the weight does not change, start weight training, exercising or participation in an active sport.  Muscle weighs more than regular tissue and the above activities will help increase muscle mass.     Regarding masturbation, the only side effect is that it takes time away from the other activities noted above which are more likely to assist with your weight situation.  At your height and age 50 kg is close to normal.  Please don't worry about it, if you are otherwise feeling healthy.|`|AA12008870	It sounds like a problem with your diet versus masterbating.
AA11478267	Adults need a minimum of 1 gram of protein for every kilogram (1kg = 2.2 pound) of body weight per day to keep from slowly breaking down their own tissues. That's about 9 grams of protein for every 20 pounds. Cereal with milk for breakfast, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch, and a piece of fish with a side of beans for dinner adds up to about 70 grams of protein, plenty for the average adult.  Some of the protein you eat contains all the amino acids needed to build new proteins. This kind is called complete protein. Animal sources (meat, fish, poultry, eggs,  dairy products) of protein tend to be complete. Other protein sources lack one or more amino acids that the body can't make from scratch or create by modifying another amino acid. Called incomplete proteins, these usually come from fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts.  A calorie is a unit of energy. One calorie is equal to 4.184 joules, a common unit of energy used in the physical sciences. Food calories are actually kilocalories (1,000 calories = 1 kilocalorie). A food calorie contains 4,184 joules.|`|795001c399742e086f214455f52a18deaa	Buy Pure Protein protein bars.

The most common symptoms of PCOS are an irregular period, infertility, increased hair growth and unusual weight gain, even with dieting or increased exercise. Women with PCOS will often go for months without a period and then start bleeding heavily for days. This occurs when the uterine lining has gotten too thick and the body must naturally shed it. Because PCOS disrupts ovulation it can be very difficult to become pregnant.     Other signs of PCOS include acne, high blood pressure, obesity, and abnormal facial and body hair growth (due to too much testosterone). One of the less recognizable symptoms of PCOS is depression, which can be misread as a bipolar illness. While depression stems from many factors, we think it is always a good idea to consider PCOS if patients have other symptoms. In some medical practices antidepressants are prescribed which do not alleviate the underlying issues and therefore are not very helpful.|`|AA10852907	Water (bottled).  Water with fresh lemon.

I've also heard it eats holes in the brain as well.

If you are two weeks late and you are positive you cannot be pregnant then it could be several things.

Are u anemic? Lack of blood in the body can lead to such a situation when ur body is not willing to loose more blood.    Did u have sex recently?If u hv ovulated on or near that date, then the egg gets fertilized with 3 dayz. of having sex and stops the body from eliminating it in through periods.    Is ur diet rich in Iron? Iron or Fe helps Heamoglobin to build up in the body and it is a very important content of a lady's diet who is menstruating!    Eat healthy and live healthy..

You don't give a lot of details, so a lot of the answers are based on assumptions and reading between the lines. I'm not sure if you're upset with a friend because you had a conversation about a male and she went along with your perspective, saying she'd never tolerate any crap from him, then did nothing when he acted the way you said he would. There is a perception sometimes among young people, that if they do anything to negatively affect someone's perception of them, i.e. a certain boy, then, because he's "popular" or "cute" or any one of 10 other things, no one will believe he was a "jerk". If this is a friend of yours, help her be strong, and let her know that you'll support her if she is strong, and be there for her if she's weak. If a crime was committed, (rape, assault, etc..) you absolutely must tell someone. Guys who act that way need not to be able to do it to anyone else. (Ask her how she'd feel if her sister was next because no one spoke up about him).    Good Luck|`|AA10239861	talk is big and everything is easier said than done.

Since premenopausal women make their own estrogen, there is no evidence at this time that use of fertility medications increases the risk of cancer or other medical illnesses. As the medications used for fertility treatments have been FDA approved since approximately 1970, it is possible that more years of use are required to see long-term problems arise.
AA12351386	Obviously, you are not as fertile as you were in the past. The fact that you have a child means that your system has worked before and it can work again.  Are you with the same partner? Are you physically healthy? Not on any long term medication?    Well, if you are OK in all the above and you have been trying for more than a year then you probably need to chat with your doctors.    It helps to know which days you are most likely to conceive. This is to increase your chances. This depends on the length of your cycle etc but I have found a website to save you the calculation.

6efcd3feb62dbf6347e785c39044c68eaa	Dee is right. The "Abs" are really one elastic muscle that runs from under the rib cage to the hip area. It is banded by other tendons that cross over it--giving the "six pack" look, but it's really one muscle. But there are supporting muscles on the sides and bottom that help define the mid-section, and that is probably what you are asking about. The best exercise by far is hanging leg lifts, preferable performed while hanging from a pull up bar.  Don't swing your legs, just start by lifting your knees toward your chest. When that becomes easy, start to extend your legs--again, no swinging--and keep the head and shoulders upright and in line with your spine.  To "see" the abs, for guys at least, takes a body fat percentage of 10% or less, so it's possible to have a strong core and not see it since a normal athletic male will still have a body fat percentage of over 10%. Check men's health magazine's website for some good tips--they are trying to sell the mag, but they have good exercise advice.|`|AA11678018	Making luv|`|AA12248108	Standard Crunch:  Lie on back with knees bent. Lift your shoulders off the floor, concentrating on moving your ribs towards your hips. Pretend a grapefruit is under your chin so you don't move your head. Easier: hands on chest. Harder: Hands on sides of head, but don't pull on head. Hardest: Hands straight out above head. Go slow and keep breathing. Try 2 seconds up, hold for 2 seconds, then 2 seconds going down.      Reverse Curl:  This targets the lower fibers of the front abdominal muscle and also the side abdominals. Lie on your back and bend your knees toward your chest as far as is comfortable, keeping hips on the floor. Contract your abdominal muscles to lift hips off the floor and bring knees toward chest. Don't swing your legs! Concentrate on using your abs to lift your pelvis toward your lower rib cage. Go slow and keep breathing. Easier: Hands on floor. Harder: Elbows on floor, hands in air.     Combination Crunch:  Do the standard crunch and the reverse curl at the same time. If you need a challenging ab exercise, this will work great.     Ab Exercises on the Ball  There are some legitimate ab products like the exercise ball (aka swiss, gym, stability ball, Fitball), which has been used by physical therapists for decades. It's one of the safest and most effective training devices for the abs and low back. Lying on the exercise ball, your hips curve down so you start your exercise at a greater range of motion than you would lying flat on the floor. This means more of the abdominal muscle gets trained.        Also visit www.bodybuildingforyou.com  It suggests leg raises as exercise for building the lower abdomen|`|abf0f466fca5c66464902ea086a242ccaa	Lay down, put your hands underneath your butt, and lift your legs together to about 30 degrees.

AA12159734	Since 14 year olds are still growing and in the proccess of puberty, it is very hard to tell what the "ideal weight" is. Although, there is something called Body Mass Index (BMI) that is very useful in determining if you are underweight, overweight, obese, or normal weight. A great place to find out your BMI is at the CDC website. The link for the calculator is http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/ . You just have to enter your height, weight, date that you measured this, and your birthday. It comes out with a chart that shows where you stand with your BMI.

It would seem to me that yawning is the   streching of the neck and head muscles in order for the veins to constrict   and move blood more rapidly to the brain.  So hypoxia of the brain or carbon   dioxide would trigger it.    For further information, study about the veins and how blood is transported   through them.|`|2e8d019a0f62f45102d5c83582de8b0eaa	We yawn in order to increase the intake of air into the lungs - thereby, hopefully wakening us up a bit.

AA11552950	I agree with WickedMagnet. What is "normally"? I don't ever recall reading a book, or hear a hard and fast rule that said, "Women all get these boobs at this age. If you don't, you are not normal." Due to genetics, we all get different sizes and develop at different rates and times in our lives. All ranges are normal. No one ever likes what they have been given, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Women with big ones wish they had smaller ones, and women without boobs wish they had them. There are problems with all sizes. Just be glad they are your own, and they are part of what makes you uniquely you.|`|AA10966809	What is "normally"??

This will really help curb your munchies.  Also, replace the junk you eat with better things (nuts, fruit, veggies)  Motivation - First, you need to set realistic goals. No you won't lose 20 lbs in a week!  Try 1 or 2 pounds a week.  Think how much better you will feel, reward yourself when you reach a monthly goal with a new outfit for example, go on a hot date, get ready for your next class reunion, or set a goal to run a marathon in 6 months, etc.  Why not ask a friend to be your diet buddy.

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	The following healthy living recommendations will help you if your trying to lose weight, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then your consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily  calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and log your physical activities.    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water.     Do not try fad diets. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training For Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness For Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues. A good free publication is  Dietary Guidelines For Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter.    *6) Make a life long commitment to good health. A great test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com Look at other areas where you can improve your health. For example, make improvements on the quality of the air you breath. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier. Email me if you want a good air purifier recommendation and if you have other questions.     *Click on all the source links below to get the full benefit of the recommendations.

7e32c9882702d23372d5256c6891043daa	Don't over excercise, you'll wear yourself out-  try changing it up- go swimming or just walk or if you have some friends that like to excercise ask them to join you or a parent- it can be good bonding time- if you are part of a gym- try some yoga, it's toning and strengthening.  If you are still tired, see if maybe certain foods are getting to you, sugary foods and bread can make your system go into a slump making you too tired- try more fruit or vegetables.  If your mom can ask her to get you some Iron - like geritol- personally I take HemaPlex that I get from a natural store- it has alot of other useful vitamins in it.  Also try to have more protein- if you are a vegetarian then have the tofu ...  If you go to the library you can ask the librarian where to find the health books, you can read all about Omega acids and stuff like that that can be useful to you and your family...  Also, sometimes when your tired you just need a quick small walk.    Since you say you are very tired I also urge you to watch out what tim of day you exercise, if it's the middle of the day in very hot weather the sun could just be too much for your body.    Drink plenty of water, sometimes tiredness can stem from not enough water inthe body.  Don't have soda or coffee, the caffiene in those will make you more dehydrated.  Plus thing containing CornSyrup are not really made for the body to break down.  Stay away from diet/fatfree or fake sugar stuff- those are full of harmful chemicals that can also wreak havoc on your body  no matter your age!    Teas like White tea or Green tea can help you with energy as well.      Try going to bed at a regular time and waking up at a regular time.  "Every half an hour before midnight is more important than any hour after midnight".  Trust me.  But also because there are scientific reasons for it.  The human body actually "repairs" itself at night- I think PBS or anyother medical/health journal at the library or on the net can help you read more about that.  I believe they said your blood and cells are "cleansed" at these crucial hours, especially since you are still young.    Limit the time you spend on the computer to an hour.  Your brain needs real nourishment not just entertainment.    Also- a book called "eat right for your type" if you know your blood type can point you in the direction of some healthy food for you- if you are eating the right foods then you will notice that your body will not be as tired either.    Talk to your parents.  If this tiredness persists you may want to see a doctor.  Notice the food you are or have been eating when you feel tired- and let your doctor know about it.    Also if you must sleep during the day limit it to 20-30 minutes any more than that and it will be harder to sleep at a decent hour at night.    I do wish you the best of luck in this,  sorry I wrote soooo much.|`|de13b14b2555f2781b9388d5aa6c007daa	You dont have to exercise like everyday.

Ossia:  BMI = peso/altezza^2    Quindi, considerando che esistono delle tabelle specifiche per cui a certi valori di BMI corrispondono diverse situazioni fisiche (obesit, sovrappeso, sottopeso, ecc), dovresti pesare tra i 55 e i 60 kg al massimo, in quanto il BMI indica una situazione di normalit, essendo i suoi valori compresi tra 18,5 e 23.|`|b2269c795b05f42a2139222832b26509aa	55-60kg|`|92c2588752cf75e4abce825e6086bde0aa	55 a 62|`|30d55ac4d410ad58b0daf6b2934c7517aa	se vuoi dire il peso " consigliato" io direi 60/63 kg, ma il peso giusto  quello che ti vedi bene e confortabile, solo te lo puoi dire.

The thing you need to work on, is not the stress (cos you said you can't change what happens), only your response to the situation.

So I think it's simple, you're spending way too much time in front of the computer. It's hurting your eyes and causing headaches.     If you can put a screen up on the monitor that reduces the radiation hitting your eyes.  Or better yet switch to working on a laptop.  When I graduated from college and began working full time I began to get severe headaches. So severe that I thought my career would be over. But other people in my office were having problems with the monitors and so I switched to a laptop and 4 years later I haven't had any problems.  Also my eye doctor confirmed that the glare from the monitor was likely causing my headaches. I hope this helps.

AA10048719	I guess this could be true. My husband says when he has that problem, it helps to go slower, and to think about something else.|`|AA12228671	Yes that could have an effect. My boyfriend had the same problem. Try jacking off and when you get close to c*mming stop untill the sensation goes away. Keep doing that a few times and then c*m. Do that however often you jack off. Then when you have sex do the same thing have sex untill you get close enough that you can stop and maybe change positions. This helped alot with my boyfriend he used last like 40 sec to a min and now he lasts like 45-1 hour. Good luck!

They both have good programs and give you little tips on different ways of doing exercises. Diet is a big consideration as well you want to limit your bad carbs and fat but get plenty of protein. Do cardio to help get your waist small.
AA12008538	Perhaps the simplest and most profound mantra is "Om," and many traditional Sanskrit mantras include it. Each one produces a specific experience of vibration that corresponds to its meaning. For example, "Om shanti", which refers to the supreme peace of the universal Spirit, creates a subtle yet powerful vibration of peace; "Hari Om" refers to the Spirit that removes the obstacles to awakening; and "Om namah sivaya" means salutations to auspiciousness, the transformative aspect of Spirit.     But you don't have to limit yourself to Sanskrit. You may use "Amen," "Shalom," or "Peace"any word that's meaningful to you. Choose something uplifting, a word that inspires you and engages your heart. Avoid words that stir up thoughts or disturb your mind. Experiment to see what feels right. But eventually, you'll want to stick with one mantra and use it regularly to help you experience the full benefits of a deep meditation practice.|`|71bffc0b506b1d0c35da4caf71b1816eaa	Yogic mantras are usually in Sanskrit.  The mantras are usually used for peace, healing and spiritual illumination.    But what mantras are, are usually words that we repeat to ourselves over and over, as affirmations.  As a yoga instructor who teaches in a gym, where my students are from many denominations, I usually ask them to repeat the mantra, "Let go" As they inhale, they say "Let" and, as they exhale, they say "go".  In letting go, they let go of those things which hold them (and those around them) back - the things of the ego, such as expectation, judgement and competition.  This is a simple mantra and one that is in English.  The reason why some yogis/inis ask that we repeat mantras in Sansrkit is because Sanskrit is a holy language and contains many powerful sounds.  Among the most powerful of the sounds is actually pure silence - followed by "OM" - the sound that underlies Creation.    And if you're looking for a mantra, one of the most powerful and widely heard mantras is "Om Nama Sivaya."  If you're looking for a book on mantras, go to www.karunamayi.org and look for the book called Vedic Mantras for Peace and Spiritual Illumination.

(reference-- 135 lbs. running 30 min. level ground= 225 calories) but what you eat matters much more than calories.    Good carbs like celery and carrots will never make you fat. Bad carbs like cake will, but you don't need to know the whole science of glycemic index and load. It is mostly NOT your fault, if you need to lose weight. The way we have been taught to eat is responsible for making obesity the number one health problem in the world (according to Atlantic Monthly magazine) replacing hunger and infectious disease. You need to re-learn how to eat so you can become thin. Not a diet, but diet lifestyle.    Find out about fastest way to lose weight, gradual ways to lose weight, most effective exercise, good and bad carbs and anti-water.

61f1330b59a7cb4fe3ffdbfaeb4db7ffaa	When was the onset of your vertigo?  Sometimes vertigo can occur if you've had dental work done, i.e. braces.  When your jaw is misaligned it can affect your inner ear.  This happened to me & it's only on my left side.  I sometimes experience being dizzy when turning to my left side lying down or doing yoga.  This is called positional Vertigo.  There are different reasons why people get or have vertigo.  Have you had your ears checked, accupunture or an herbalist would help to.  Check out  other alternatives besides drugs.    The Epley or Semont Maneuver    Recently, researchers have found that a simple and well-tolerated physical therapy technique performed in the office can relieve the vertigo in a high percentage of patients. The Otolith Repositioning Procedure of Semont and Epley has become well accepted and is based on using gravity to move the crystals away from the nerve endings into an area of the inner ear that wont cause any problems. Sometimes, a vibrator is placed on the mastoid to "liberate" the particles and improve the procedure's success.     The patient is moved into the various positions, the posterior semicircular canal is rotated in such a way as to deposit the displaced otoconia back into the vestibule where they can do no further harm.    In our experience, approximately 75% of patients are cured with one maneuver. This percentage increases with repeated treatments. Following the maneuver, patients must not lie flat for 48 hours, meaning they should sleep in a recliner or propped up on pillows. Also, after 48 hours, patients should not lay down on the affected ear for at least one week following the treatment. Even tying shoes or bending over should be avoided during this week. These instructions help prevent the crystals from falling back into the balance chamber.  Hopes this helps some.|`|d0f6ce19b1145dd15ff3b5447ac7086baa	Both my parents and an Aunt had this...it's an inner ear infection and has to be cured with the medication...while waiting to get better, all you can do to feel the best possible, is to just LAY DOWN AND STAY STILL!!!

It will take half the time of trying to jog for 45-60 minutes, and it works good try it.  You better have some stamina though.  "Walk or jog (for 2 minutes) to get warmed up, then sprint for as long as you can take it, (2-5 minutes) then walk till you catch your breath, then repeat. You only need to do this for 12-18 minutes.  It is not meant to burn calories, it is meant to jack up your metabolism for 5-7 hours.   You can use this technique with an exercise bike too, or any machine or non-machine, be creative, it really works.

8a69beda4b55c272990be670ae23be1baa	Its not a matter of IF you lift everyday, its matter of intensity and what your working out. A general rule of thumb is to not work out a muscle group until the soreness from the previous training session has gone away. I find one thing I always try to keep in mind is to try and finish my training cycle with arms and then legs at the end. When you do arms at the beginning of a cycle, growth can be inhibited because biceps and triceps are secondary muscles in almost every upper body exercise. So by doing them second to last in a cycle, it gives your arms a good rest so they can grow as fast as the rest of your muscles. But yeah, you can train everyday, just try and not train a muscle group until the soreness has gone away.|`|4b564bb3ab575624291b9bf6798b56bdaa	I find if I don't lift every 4th or 5th day My muscles grow more and my lifting is better.|`|AA10232591	you need to let your muscles rest.If you want to work out everyday,work out a different muscle group.|`|49b1007366f32e26f4d2adc4b636710faa	it depends how old you are and how much your body is still growing/developing. they say younger guys (under 15) shouldn't lift because that can interfere with natural muscle growth. the older you are, the safer it is to lift.|`|AA11408260	you can lift every day if you want, but what's more important is to give a weak rest between training the same muscle,  that means that if u trained your biceps on sunday, dont train it again for the next sunday  that is so important for your muscle to take time for growth, and building up new muscle fibres,   less than a week rest then you will be overtraining.|`|d487a333a16a3d1fa155f1b6ad4f8853aa	When you life everyday and do the same body parts you will get stronger but not bigger. When you life weights your muscles will tear which along with the enzyme creatine kinase you feel the burn. You need to have intervels or rests between body groups for good muscle and strengh development. As well as letting the enzymes decrease which could lead to endocrine problems. Think of it this way when you lift your muscle rips or tears and needs to heal. When muscles heal "with a good protein diet" they fill in the rips and tears with more muscle. Which of course enlarges them. If you keep lifting then they keep re-tearing or ripping in the same spot over and over again and never really filling in and getting stronger. Waiting a day is good but if you develop a 7 day plan such as this you will see better results:  1. Chest and Arms  2. Legs  3. Rest  4. Abs  5. Back  6. Rest  7. Cardio     If your looking to look like th emen and women on muscle fitness well most if not all got there with Steroids at one point, which in the long run adds more problems.

Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper.

It'll be more fun and it'll get you excited about running. Start off with maybe a 1 mile run, then do that for a few days, then do a 1.5 mile run, then 2 mile etc. etc. You can also go to the gym and run on a machine.   Also, remember to keep encouraging yourself and don't give up. You have to have good self control if you want to be able to go on a diet, or start a fitness program.

I don't know if one tablet could do it.|`|AA11820208	If the antidepressant is the only medication this person is on then it could possibly (unlikely) trigger a manic episode.  Hypomanic is more likely.  If this person takes no mood stabilizers at all then the manic episode can just simply occur.  It needs no trigger.  I would consider someone who is bipolar and only taking antidepressants to be unmedicated because you are only taking medicine for one side of the disorder.  I'm bipolar I which means I am more prone to mania.  I take no antidepressants because, well, I'm not depressed.  I have been warned about them though, and strongly advised against them as they can trigger mania.  It is not likely that one pill would unravel a whole episode though.|`|AA12361453	Ido not think so.

309086754ea46556b7f9a39adc35b045aa	I usually masturbate to a orgasm. It will relax you and cause you forget about your cramps. A good way to do this is to lie in your tub naked and ajust your shower head to hard spray and aim for your clit.You will most likly enjoy the water sensation.For some women, it makes cramps worse becase the uterus contracts during orgasm. If that dosent work, use a heating pad and drink herbal tea.

0dfdfd17b826007a3b32c45333fd36c3aa	There is a physiological dependence - it is neurophysiological. As for the etymology of the word addiction, it is derived from the second declension masculine Latin noun 'addictus', which means 'debt slave', and the 1st/2nd declension adjective 'addictus', which means, unsurprisingly, 'addicted'.|`|AA12096119	An addiction can be classified as anything a person abuses on a regular basis.  An excessive gambler for example, will have the addiction to over spend his or her money just to get the "high" from winning a pot.  Highs of any kind, whether it is a physical high or psychological high can become dangerous. Many people that experience "highs" from doing gambling, sex, drugs, relationships etc. aren't always considered addicts.  The addicts are the ones that continue to do these activities to make them feel "high" or "powerful".  In the beginning the people may say that is their "vice", but later on down the road, the vice can be an addiction that they find difficult to stop or control.

74f6e9c781f075922b7cd21447a9fab7aa	Has your friend also been tested for Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome?    However, MTHFR in itself can cause miscarriage.  I highly suggest that you friend be followed by a hematologist and when she is ready to become pregnant again by a perinatologist.|`|AA11478267	MTHFR - methylene tetra hydro folate reductase   MTHFR is a gene that is responsible for making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. This enzyme plays a role in processing amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and for a chemical reaction involving forms of the vitamin folate, which is also called folic acid or vitamin B9. Specifically, this enzyme converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This reaction is required for the multistep process that converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine.  When MTHFR gene is defective ( 1defect or 2 defective genes) the levels of homocysteine in the body goes up (homocystinuria). It may also play a role in the risk of high blood pressure in pregnancy (preeclampsia) and may be a risk factor for birth defects that occur during the development of the brain and spinal cord (neural tube defects). High homocysteine levels  is  toxic causing  damage to the developing placenta tissues resulting in spontaneous miscarriages  and somehow caustic to the endothelium tissue lining blood vessels. (that is why your friend had miscarriage).

b5a09481e51315cad10306e18ab1ac53aa	If U R FEELING SELF CONSCIOUS....don't !!!! That is your body and u should love what u have, but do not wear clothes that accentuate your breast. I.E. tank tops, strapless blouses, bustier, bikini tops etc.  If  they continue to grow, u will grow and adjust to them.  Don't worry about them unless they give u problems, like if it is difficult to compete in sports, or running. or just everyday activities.  Then u should talk with your parent.

847bf395ccbbf5f1f95b98f6600a0886aa	hey girl,     i have my belly button periced and from my experince and others that have had thers done i would say that it didnt hurt me, it was a quick pinch and it was all over, it goes very fast and you get all worked up for a quick pinch. Trust me i was very nervous and then after that second i was like why was i gettin so worked up for that? on the other hand people have told me it hurt them. It may also be how you deal with pain.|`|AA12261175	It's MUCH more painful than ears.  They use a clamp and pull the skin away from your body, then push a needle thru.  I found it very painful and pleasurable simultaneously.  Mine is pierced thru the side instead of the top and I have always liked it.  It has been there about 8 years or so.  The worst part is the healing- you must clean it by turning it with soap on it in the shower.  It is very very sore for a few weeks, especially the first week.  You won't want to touch/bother it, but you must to clean it.|`|592a2c645b7aa41b6037147a986889d5aa	i got mine for $30. It was painful, but you don't really remember the pain later. if you get pregnant you can wear a longer barbell. allows stretching.|`|3fffb3c47d94202d310d49065b1d3efbaa	I had mine pierced when i was 19.  it didn't hurt terribly, but wasn't comfortable either.  a lot of people are sensitive to the "nickel' that most piercings are done with and have a hard time "healing" as i did.  i kept mine in for a little over a year before giving it up.  i got pregnant about 2 months later, and now 6 years later i have a scar.  not only do i have a scar, but the skin between the holes of the piercing is hangy and loose.  i'm not sure there's anything to prevent that.  good luck, if you want my honest advice, it's "cute" but i'm sure your bare belly button is too.  no need to obviously draw attention to the obviously already cuteness:)|`|72cebc72556ed0618d6acc866009d8b9aa	I got mine done just a month ago and it wasn't that bad. The bad part is healing. It takes up nine or twelve months to completely heal. You have to clean it up to four times a day to avoid infection which is easy. It is sore after wards believe me|`|c932c4ae2301538042177f22beee43d9aa	Its so quick before you know it its over.  I dont know about the pregnant scar?  Never have had kids|`|ce249c720f81f8a7728b3fa224eb1b4aaa	i got mine done almost four years ago, and from what i remember it didn't hurt much at all.  the only thing you'll really feel is when they put the clamp on.  they shove the needle through and get the jewelry in so quick that you hardly feel it.  i can't imagine the scar would be too bad, just a little indentation where the hole once was... i've had my ears pierced altogether thirteen times and if you can survive getting your ears pierced, you'll be fine with this.  your nerves are what will get you most.  if you want to get it done, i recommend it.  good luck!
AA10068271	Yes Romance is an important part of a relationship, but people have to work at it.

I would like to think I'm romantic, but my GF would best answer that. I guess its just a human nature to feel wanted and to feel that someone you love can go the extra effort for you. Its also kind of sad because these days its more often than it being romantic is taken for granted. People don't realize how much good it can do for a relationship.    As for morning or night, I'm not really sure... I prefer a bit of both but it depends on what I'm up to...night is good for romancing naturally but romance doesn't have time...its just a moment.|`|2e6d650e3810c725f8162a731f6eeb5daa	to me romance is being always in a jolly mood with one u love. ya it is an important part of a healthy relationship. it always keep one on heels n the other person feels appreciated.every action has equal n opposite reaction. so here i would say Evey romantic gesture has equal impression on u'r opposite partner.|`|c1e129348bf5e9e1ec5bb015504b6771aa	Is not.|`|eb6c526d3f0ae2da79fc29957b11fc14aa	romance is important , without that theres nothing , I am an all day romantic I send flowers to my husband , tell him all the time that I love him, stair into his beauty full brown eyes tell him he is handsome , all that mushy stuff like that ,,,,,,,
AA11229176	Check out www.centerwatch.com and https://www.acurian.com/nws_home_page.js... to locate trials in your area and medical discipline.  Good luck.|`|415fc4b59e89a95acf4cac97823d4179aa	Clinical trials for what specifically?
AA11394576	Iyengar recommends the following poses for diabetes:  janu-sirsasana, paschimottanasana, virasana, supta virasana, akarna dhanurasana, salabhasana, dhanurasana, paripoorna navasana, ardha navasana, jatara parivartanasana, uttanasana, marichyasana, ardha matsyendrasana, pasasana, paripoorna matseyndrasana, urdhva danurasana, dwipada viparita dandasana, mayurasana, hamsasana, bhujangasana, and savasana    There is no way to guarantee that these poses will produce insulin, but the are all recommended by one of the living masters of yoga for people who suffer from diabetes.    Namaste!|`|394d76ab4f2435dc0f4f3f6b86a90e56aa	There isn't any yoga that will produce insulin.  don't believe the snake oil salesmen.
AA11394576	Yes, wrist injuries can be common in yoga, particularly in the more "agressive" styles.  My best guess is that you're having some sort of alignment problem in poses like down dog, plank, etc-- poses that ask you to support a lot of your weight on your wrists.      Probably the safest thing to do is to find a yoga class that is called something like classical, hatha, or Iyengar and start using those to supplement your power yoga practice.  A slower paced class with a heavy emphasis on alignment will help you avoid all sorts of injuries.    You could also try spending some time at home working on down dog and plank to find the right alignment in your arms.  Make sure your hands are roughly parallel to each other and push down into the part of your hand between the thumb and  the pointer finger-- there should be no space for someone to insert a finger under your hand in that area.   Look at your arms and notice where the "pits" of your elbows face.  Be sure that your arm is rotated in the shoulder socket so the insides of your elbows face each other.  If your arms are rotated correctly in the shoulder sockets you will feel no discomfort in your wrists and you will feel great strength in the pose.  Be sure your shoulders are moving down your back and not hunched up around your ears.  Be very careful!!!  If you choose to work on this at home use extreme caution so that you do not hurt your wrists.  Give your wrists a chance to heal before you begin working them too much.    Good luck and namaste!|`|7f6c76ee84954355bfe03997b817e53caa	Nope. Yer pushing yourself too much.|`|88d06fbec376aa728c65be28911b5cf3aa	only if your doing it wrong

AA10040769	As far as medically, green stool means that food is moving through the large intestine too quickly, such as due to diarrhea- this can be the case of an infection. As a result, bile doesn't have time to break down completely. As far as foods, green leafy vegetables, and green food coloring, such as in Kool-Aid or popsicles can cause a stool to be green so can certain vitamins and medications. If it is not diet, he should see his doctor to determine the exact cause.|`|AA10738882	i dont know|`|AA12249653	Does your Husband drink a lot of purple colored drinks such as grape juice,grape sodas,grape kool-aid, gatorade or powerade?  I dont think you have anything to worry about,it is just the food color dyes changing the color of the stool. In the color spectrum if you mix purple with brown,the end result color will be green. I have kidded with co-workers and friends that drink purple colored drinks and told them: Dont you know that too much of that purple stuff will turn your "sh-t" green. It's true!|`|0b51f039152fd98055ac6df9f7c8ba2baa	He's eating too fast. Take small bites.
AA10121986	Most of the vitamins we take are not totally absorbed in our body tissues and cells. Unabsorbed part goes out with urine. And urine  gets the color if any colored vitamin is taken. Once you stop taking that colored vitamin, color of urine turns back to its original shade (clear & straw color).  In your case, the multivitamin you are taking contains, I think, yellow colored vitamin B-2 (Riboflavin) and/or red colored Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamine). Your urine will have the color of these vitamins which remained unabsorbed in your body. Vitamin-C again, may cause some change in color for oxidation of these vitamins,  but it will disappear while you stop taking that multivitamin.   So, nothing to be tensed, its just normal.|`|AA12063527	That's normal.  Your body is getting rid of the extra vitamins it doesn't need.|`|AA12261175	(Hey, here I am busting in on men's health.  Since men do it to us,  I figured why not?)    Neon yellow pee is normal when you take vitamins.  Mine always is neon yellow for a little while afterward.  Bye guys!|`|307aea61e787ef65a984420386094816aa	Working out can cause a lot of things to change in your body.  I hope you are going at it slow. As far as the Vitamins be careful  You should go to the doctor before starting anything, If you go to the doc just ask for a simple UA they aren't painful. A lot of times people don't need all those Vitamins if you are eating right. Good Luck I wouldn't worry to much just see the doc for a simple  check up.|`|3566f23d286239af5ce0727ca1c327deaa	don't take the vitamin for a while to see if your urine goes back to its normal color. be aware that in many cases excess vitamins especilally vitamin C is harmful. we call it hypervitaminose C. if you use fresh fruits you don't need to take a pill. good luck|`|1d896ecc34e34f5664aa51a74342c451aa	The body excretes the B complex vitamins that it does not use, in the urine. These are called water soluble vitamins. This is normal. It will continue. Working out will also contribute to the yellowness of urine, both from dehydration and from muscle breakdown (if you work out hard.) Keep drinking lots of watter during and after workouts.|`|4d429f16bbd3e04aed0063c1f4ab6735aa	The color change is from the vitamin, and as long as you take it, it will stay the new color. Harmless side effect.|`|AA10508820	yes it's fine, you pee out what your body does not use or need..|`|AA12114328	you should check with car lover 42020|`|aac170281e9d31d889a11d361efd87f8aa	It is caused by vitamin B which is included in multivitamins. It's normal, no cause for alarm.|`|b6f407c5aa9bf36fe7e2bcc31049092aaa	I take a lot of vitamins and a yellow urine just means that you are peeing out the vitamins.   Vitamin C will not do that but the multivitamins will cause your urine to be yellow. It is not great that you and most of us taking vitamins often are just peeing out the vitamins.
52201e72bba06b49174869467ffdcf6baa	well, as a side effect, it is natural to feel pain, depending on the size of your parteners penis. it is very much natural, it could also be something. depending on what pain your feeling. if its vaginal, it can be natural because, the vaginal tissues may even tear during intercourse, so that brings the pain, but if theres pain somewhere else, probable you need to check a doctor, it could be serious.|`|43b6df734057d87ef5d75372959620beaa	No, not as far as I know.

47a05b4d525fd09167deed9e74273685aa	It depends on the type of ear infection. If you have swimmers ear, that affects the external ear canal and would be in contact with the water and could then lead to additional problems. If you have a middle ear infection (most common with kids, refered to as fluid behind the ear drum), swimming wouldn't cause the infection to worsen unless the ear drum has ruptured. However, if you have a middle ear infection and go under water, the pressure on the ear drum will hurt badly secondary to increased pressure internally and externally. If it is an inner ear infection, you probably would feel too sick to swim anyway. As a whole, unless, it is otitis externa (swimmers ear) or a ruptured/perforated eardrum, swimming is not contraindicated but may cause some discomfort. Have fun!|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Yes, because you can swim without using your ear.  Nevertheless, it will hurt but try it if it does not.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	No, because the water from the pool could make it worse.  I know I've had swimmer's ear before and had to stay out for about a week.  Now, if you could go in and not get your head wet, I'd say go for it.|`|AA11172694	Only if you have very good ear plugs!!|`|86aeba562dcc96305b7759f4714b5c51aa	You can make sure you got some really good ear plugs and a water hat where the water doesn't get inside your ears.|`|AA10356839	Absolutely not.|`|AA11121299	Should not.|`|AA10020220	Not a good idea, but if you put cotton in the infected ear, and don't go underwater, you should be ok.|`|AA12261175	come on|`|AA11438875	No I don't think so, esp cuz of the chlorine. I'd wait til the infection cleared up. It might do more harm than good to swim w/ an ear infection. Or maybe you should ask your dr.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	after you are on antibiotics for 3 or more days I would say it would be ok. just don't get too much sun.  you could ask your doctor to be on the safe side|`|a00e4ed330427fcc4bd356a46cabc646aa	Chlorine....will make it better if it is in the pool..Hydrogen Peroxide does wonders....|`|AA11882074	Chlorine, will make it better if your in a pool!

Se ti piacciono pasta e pizza mangiale a pranzo e non a cena, possibilmente condite in maniera salutare (es. sugo non troppo soffritto, evitando panna e maionese nell'insalata di riso. Se vai in pizzeria prendi una pizza semplice)  A cena cerca di consumare proteine e verdure cotte ed evita pane e farinacei in genere.  Bevi acqua naturale preferibilmente lontano dai pasti. Mangia la frutta peferibilmente al mattino e lontano dai pasti.  Se sei golosa consuma piccole porzioni di un dolce e non ti lasciar andare finch non raggiungi il peso che desideri. Se sei tanto golosa puoi anche mangiare SOLO un bel gelato (visto che siamo in estate) a pranzo. Poi cerca almeno di camminare tanto.

AA11102769	Its a diuretic and you will have to pee more often, thats normal.     But I have never suffered constipation from drinking green tea, and I never heard of that being a side effect of it. Stop drinking it for a little while and see if your stomach feels better. If not, then something else is causing your stomach problems.|`|224f397ad57ab0c443a40bbcf4a224d4aa	If you have a sensitive stomach, Green Tea may cause acid stomach, stomach irritation, and poor appetite. Intake of large quantities can lead to constipation or diarrhea. Adding milk to the tea will usually eliminate these side effects by reducing the potency of the tannins.     Doses of 300 milligrams of caffeine (about 5 cups of tea) can cause restlessness, tremors, and exaggerated reflexes. The first signs of outright poisoning are vomiting and abdominal spasms.      It's impossible to drink enough tea to be fatal. However, regular daily intake of excessive doses (1,500 milligrams of caffeine, or 25 cups of tea) will result in irritability, sleeplessness, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and headache.     I would cut back to one cup a day or even one cup every other day or until your bowl movements are more regular.|`|ad707cbe5ea6812a1ebd06b2fdc764cbaa	well not sure but never happened to me|`|932dcbe9f45e92a954d04c50be3d2e9eaa	Are you taking green tea as a therapudic?

Credo che se qualcuno ti fa davvero del male, desiderandolo e con la consapevolezza di farlo, sia inevitabile desiderare che soffra. Per continuo a pensare che sarebbe meglio riuscire a perdonare, ma non per finto moralismo, ma perch vorrebbe proprio dire mettersi alle spalle un episodio negativo e smettere di soffrire.

Eat slowly because then your brain will have more time to recognize when you are full. Stop eating when you get full. Cut back on the snacks, and eat smaller portions (esp at restaurants, get a box to take home leftovers).     The problem with counting pounds is that muscle mass is heavier than fat. I used to dance but haven't for a few months. None of my clothes fit any more and my family noticed I'm a little bigger. BUT I haven't gained any weight.     Also, your screen name looks Indian.

If you didn't see a counselor after you were sexually abused to help you deal, understand, and get control back over your mind, you should definitely see one. There may be problems or concerns there that you cant even recognize or identify.  Even if you are not sure this problem has to do with your past experience, see the counselor anyway to rule it out.  There are a number of things that COULD be the cause of not being in the mood. But i would start there, for you and for your relationship with your boyfriend.|`|8a8b02c8c35bd0b4a51b47f7cf1d6d97aa	Have you had counselling or talked to anyone about it? You were violated in the most vicious way a woman could be violated, so you are feeling repercussions of a past experience. You really need to speak to a doctor and a counselor as soon as possible.|`|0dfe281e79bce2a959f6fbb298117653aa	Rape is a serious violation particularly when the perpetrator is someone you loved/trusted. You don't say if you had counselling afterwards but if you haven't I would say start there. Contact your local rape crisis centre if you have one or talk to your doctor so that you can get specialist help. If your current boyfriend is aware of what occurred I'm sure he will understand and be as patient as you need him to be He may at times feel frustrated as sex in a loving relationship is often more about intimacy and strengthening the connection between you two but that's okay, you can be patient with him also and find other ways (non-sexual) to reassure him that the love is there but you need to take baby steps. Maybe if you feel counselling is the right way to go for you, then at a later date he could also join you so that you can work on dealing with the effect that rape can have on future relationships. I wish you all the luck with this, be strong and don't blame yourself instead focus on loving yourself and allowing others to love you too!    UPDATE based on your update:-: If you do not want therapy, then maybe you and your boyfriend can talk about how you both feel right now, what you want to happen in the future and ways to get there that can meet the needs of you both! I would definitely take sex out of the equation for now though and look at touch that feels less intrusive to you, again this is something that you can work out!

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	Read this excerpt from the book "Dieting for Dummies" by Jane Kirby: "Don't cut your calorie level drastically when trying to lose weight; this strategy will backfire. Your body is programmed to defend your usual weight, so when calories are cut severely - to fewer than 800 to 1,000 a day - your metabolic rate adjusts to conserve the few calories you do give your body.    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...    Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter. An excellent free online resource is at http://www.exrx.net/    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter. A reputable test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com    Look at all areas where you can enhance your health. For example, make improvements in the quality of the air you breathe. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier.

Please don't diet yourself to a wrecked metabolism.    How many calories you need a day depends on your age and activity level. Assuming that you are at an adult or teen, and obviously not sedentary, you aren't eating nearly enough. In fact, your intake is beneath the levels the Geneva Conventions say must be provided to prisoners of war by their captors.    Your body is going to go into famine mode, if it isn't already there. You won't be able to lose more weight easily, or will be burning muscle.

Starving yourself is a bad way to loose weight. It will work initially, but as your metabolism slows, due to a lack of caloric intake, you'll eventually gain the weight back, then some. Now, with a slower metabolism, you'll have even more trouble trying to loose weight.    The only healthy way to loose weight and keep it off is to consume your needed caloric intake (healthy foods of course, probably around 2000/day), and exercise regularly.|`|8c9d225dad2c0d82d38d3b55fce773e9aa	Are you starving yourself intentionally?If your overweight  it will make you lose weight , but it sure doesn't sound healthy.|`|e35e9f28e808cb8da332ed68485367f4aa	Always check with your doctor before beginning any exercise and nutrition plan.  You need a good combination of aerobic activity and resistance training combined with a healthy diet.  It is not recommended to lose more than 1-3 lbs a week. If you want to lose weight the correct and safe way that will stay off for the long-term, you need a good comprehensive exercise and nutrition plan.    A good program looks like this:    Always warm up and cool down    Muscular Strength & Endurance-you need a good resistance training program that includes exercises for all muscle groups (hips, chest, upper and mid back, legs (quads and hamstrings), shoulders, lower back, upper arms (biceps and triceps), calves, forearms, abdomen, and the gluteus maximus).  For muscular strength you need high weight and low reps. For muscular endurance you need high reps and low weight.  Both are very important to a workout program and I would suggest you to change it out every couple of weeks or so.  For a beginner, your intensity should be 70-80% 1-RM or 8-12-RM, 8-12 reps, 1 or more sets, 3 times a week for 6 weeks or more when you begin a resistance program. You should begin with 1 exercise for each major muscle group and make sure the days you do resistance training are not consecutive meaning you don't exercise the same muscle group two days in a row. As you continue your program you can add more exercises, add weight, and change up your program to include more days or just work specific muscle groups on specific days. As your muscles grow stronger you will be able to reduce the rest time between each set. You should rest for about 30 seconds between sets.   As you begin to learn more about weight lifting and gain more strength you can begin to change your program to either target muscular strength or endurance.  For muscular strength you would decrease your reps and increase your weight.  Start out trying 2 sets of 8 reps each and see how it works out. You can always add more reps but dont go over 10 reps.   You should fatigue your muscles by the 8th rep, especially on the 2nd set. If you are not getting to the point of fatigue this means you need to increase the weight. If you are not able to correctly perform 2 sets of 8 reps then that means you need to decrease the weight.  For muscular endurance you would increase your reps and decrease your weight.  You should try to do 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps.    Muscle is metabolically active and therefore when you gain muscle it burns more calories and helps to raise your metabolism.  If you do not have money for a gym membership or do not have access to one, here is a great website to create a work out plan only using your body weight.  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercise...  You can also search for all kinds of exercises that use weight.  Here is another great website for finding some good exercises for different parts of the body.  http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/St...  Here is a great link to a comprehensive musculoskeletal atlas of the body to help you understand what exactly you are working  http://www.preventdisease.com/home/muscl...  Also, if you are having trouble deciding what type of program you should be doing, here is a website that may help you to better understand the different forms of strength.  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kelly2.h...          Cardiovascular Endurance-This part is extremely important for fat burning and enhancing your overall cardiovascular performance.  You need to include a warm-up and cool-down.  In order to have an effective cardio plan you must first make sure you remain in your target heart rate zone for at least 30 minutes a day (you can start out doing this for 3 days a week and build up) and then you can build up to 45-60 minutes a day.  This will seriously help to burn fat as well as raise your VO2Max which is basically a number that represents the capacity of your cardiorespiratory system.  The higher the number the more efficient your cardio system is.  You can learn more about VO2 at the following website.  http://www.preventdisease.com/news/artic...  In order to determine your target heart rate, do the following:  know these numbers:  maximum heart rate= (220-age)  resting heart rate=(get this by counting your pulse for a minute when you first wake up in the morning)  heart rate reserve=(maximum heart rate-resting heart rate)  then calculate training intensity:  TI= Heart rate reserve x percentage(use 70%-85%) + resting heart rate  Now your training intensity number is important because this is the number you want to reach for a particular training intensity.  This is the number your heart rate has to get to in order to be in the optimum cardio training zone.  You can perform the TI equation for 70% and then another for 85% to get a good range for your heart rate.  This is your own personal target heart rate zone.  You can either count your pulse yourself or use a heart rate monitor while you are exercising.  You can buy one at most electronic stores.  I recommend the heart rate monitor because you don't have to do anything and it lets you know where you are.    Some even beep when you reach your zone or when you go above it.  Mine has a strap you put on under your clothes and a watch that shows you your heart rate as well as other things.  Now of course, any type of heart rate monitor wil

Alot of people for whatever reason form the opinion that sex is bad, dirty, etc, and that touching oneself is wrong. Thoughts like that could stop the completion of your sexual experience. Have you ever had a negative experience with sex or been violated sexually? Perhaps you might talk to your doctor or maybe a county health practitioner. There could be any number of things going on and you should have it taken care of so you can fully enjoy life.   I just got to thinking, are you saying you don't ejaculate?

d3211c4dc14b329044e2375d70655dd4aa	yes, it is very possible for a woman to ejaculate. G-spot orgasms can cause a gush. It is not as thick. Some females say that the first time they ejaculated they wondered if they had peed.  Here are a couple snippets i found.    A clear or milky fluid which emerges from the vagina (sometimes with force), has a composition similar to the fluid generated in males by the prostate gland, and is generated by Skene's glands.     Currently, the nature of female ejaculation is rather unclear. There are only a few articles published in medical journals dealing with this topic and most have no serious data about the origin or composition of the fluid expelled. To complicate matters further, the little data available is inconsistent.    Cool, huh?|`|8e1f140936dd7a827f6f2be48b9a9545aa	Since ancient times, sensualists have known about the role of the G-spot, or female prostate gland, in bringing women to intense arousal and giving her intense pleasure.

AA10276469	The most common side effects that may occur with Risperdal, in the treatment of bipolar mania either alone or in combination with a mood stabilizer (Valproate or Lithium) are: sleepiness, muscle stiffness, restlessness, tremor, indigestion, nausea, abnormal vision, muscle aches, dizziness, runny nose, diarrhea, increased saliva, stomach pain, and urinary incontinence. Common side effects that may occur with Risperdal treatment of schizophrenia are: anxiety, sleepiness, restlessness, tremors, muscle stiffness, dizziness, constipation, nausea, indigestion, runny nose, rash, and rapid heart beat.    In addition to the less serious Risperdal side effects experts have found that Risperdal may also include serious side effects including:    Diabetes   Diabetic Coma   Hyperglycemia   Ketoacidosis   Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome  Pancreatitis   Stroke   Tardive Diskinesia *   Weight Gain   Death    * Tardive dyskinesia is a lifelong condition with no known effective treatment that has been shown to occur among atypical antipsychotic medication users. Only if identified in early stages can tardive dyskinesia sometimes be reversed. Older patients and women are at an especially high risk for suffering Risperdal side effects like tardive dyskinesia.|`|61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	RISPERDAL?     ~Orthostatic Hypotension ~  RISPERDAL? (risperidone) may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.2% (6/2607) of RISPERDAL?-treated patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies. The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 2 mg total (either QD or 1 mg BID) in normal adults and 0.5 mg BID in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. A dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. RISPERDAL? should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of RISPERDAL? and antihypertensive medication.    ~Seizures~  During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.3% (9/2607) of RISPERDAL?-treated patients, two in association with hyponatremia. RISPERDAL? should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures. Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. RISPERDAL? and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.    ~Hyperprolactinemia ~  As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia and/or neoplasia was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats (see PRECAUTIONS  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility). However, neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.    ~Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment ~Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event associated with RISPERDAL? treatment, especially when ascertained by direct questioning of patients. This adverse event is dose-related, and in a study utilizing a checklist to detect adverse events, 41% of the high-dose patients (RISPERDAL? 16 mg/day) reported somnolence compared to 16% of placebo patients. Direct questioning is more sensitive for detecting adverse events than spontaneous reporting, by which 8% of RISPERDAL? 16 mg/day patients and 1% of placebo patients reported somnolence as an adverse event. Since RISPERDAL? has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that RISPERDAL? therapy does not affect them adversely.     ~Priapism ~  Rare cases of priapism have been reported. While the relationship of the events to RISPERDAL? use has not been established, other drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that RISPERDAL? may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.    ~Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) ~A single case of TTP was reported in a 28 year-old female patient receiving RISPERDAL? in a large, open premarketing experience (approximately 1300 patients). She experienced jaundice, fever, and bruising, but eventually recovered after receiving plasmapheresis. The relationship to RISPERDAL? therapy is unknown.    ~Antiemetic Effect ~  Risperidone has an antiemetic effect in animals; this effect may also occur in humans, and may mask signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain drugs or of conditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye's syndrome, and brain tumor.    ~Body Temperature Regulation~  Disruption of body temperature regulation has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with oral RISPERDAL? use. Caution is advised when prescribing for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes.    ~Suicide ~  The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for RISPERDAL? should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets, consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with RISPERDAL? in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using RISPERDAL? in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.    RISPERDAL? has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with |`|AA10231289	Go on line and look it up.

AA11118338	Usually when you first get your period it is very irregular. I'm 15, got mine when I was 11 and it still isn't completely regular. It is normal to go several months without seeing it. Don't worry it will be back soon enough!|`|AA12236672	Why Isn't My Period Regular?  It can take up to 3 years from the time a girl starts menstruating for her body to develop a regular cycle. Even then, what's regular varies from person to person. Girls' cycles can range from 21 to 45 days.    Changing hormone levels might make your period short one month (such as 2 or 3 days) and more drawn out (such as 7 days) the next. You might skip a few months, get two periods almost right after each other, have a really heavy period, or one so light you almost don't notice it. (If you're sexually active and you skip a period, though, you should visit your doctor or a women's clinic to make sure you're not pregnant.)    All this irregularity can make planning for your period a real hassle. Try to keep track of when your last period started, and guess that about 4 weeks from that day you could be due for another. If you're worried about wearing that cute dress and suddenly starting your period at school, just make sure you pack protection. Carry a pad or tampon in your backpack, and wear a pantiliner to handle the first wave.    When it comes to periods, every girl's body has a unique (and unpredictable) timeline for getting on track. If your period still has not settled into a relatively predictable pattern after 3 years, or if you have four or five regular periods and then skip your periods for a couple of months, make an appointment with your doctor to check for possible problems.|`|dab4a4c0b899b05d28423d65701502a1aa	there is no problem, it wont be regular until 2-3 yrs after yuv started it, thats how it was for me but now its normal, I got my first one in october and didnt get the 2nd one until january.|`|AA10754448	At your age (of 13), it is normal for you to have irregular menstrual cycles.

95566d317e6d9f7b0308b7d48bf25a12aa	Of all drugs, cocaine creates the greatest psychological dependence. It stimulates key pleasure centers within the brain and causes extremely heightened euphoria. However, an individual quickly develops a tolerance to the drug, requiring higher dosages and more frequent use in order to get the same effect. Cocaine cravings can be so strong that just the memory of the euphoria associated with use of the drug can trigger the desire to use it again, even after long periods of abstinence.|`|54f79decfe6f7f317c647500943eff47aa	stick with coca leafs instead. make tea or just chew on them with mineral lime.|`|5c9dab7742e64475a5ccf7dd3dc968c8aa	" Dopamine makes it addictive."-(nate p)    Dopamine is a chemical naturally produced in the body. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter, activating dopamine receptors. Dopamine is also a neurohormone released by the hypothalamus. Its main function as a hormone is to inhibit the release of prolactin from the anterior lobe of the pituitary.    Dopamine can be supplied as a medication that acts on the sympathetic nervous system, producing effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. However, since dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, dopamine given as a drug does not directly affect the central nervous system. To increase the amount of dopamine in the brains of patients with diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Dopa-Responsive Dystonia, a synthetic precursor to dopamine such as L-DOPA can be given, since this will cross the blood-brain barrier.|`|8aadccea34a9c91e1becc33803abf54caa	Without getting too technical, this is what we learned in The Psychology of Alcohol and Drug addiction.  Cocaine targets a pleasure center in the brain causing euphoria (you feel like you can do anything).  Unfortunately, it also replaces a neurotransmitter in the brain (substances that control activity).  When you use cocaine, and it replaces this substance, the brain begins to produce less of it.  Then when you're not using cocaine you get withdrawals from lack of the neurotransmitter, and you need more cocaine to make the brain function again.  It's two fold.  You like the high (euphoria) plus you have to use it to keep from getting withdrawals.  Same goes for heroine, etc..|`|f6ce5e73b9eb8d1e21fccb4a7f844bceaa	I cant answer that question because its different for every single human...however, if you want to know about cocaine specifically and everything contributing to this mysterious substance, I recommend a book by Dominic Stratifeild called Cocaine - An Unauthorized Biography.

It's because of the intense "rush" people get from snorting it. Snorting the drug makes it enter your bloodstream directly, which affects the hormones produced in the brain by stimulating the central nervous system. It is usually snorted due to the fact that if it were swallowed, the effects would only gradually  take place.. wihch results in no intense "rush".  When the central nervous system is stimulated.. the person feels euphoria and a general sense of well-being. This is the reason it is so addicting.. people remember the times they used the drug.. and felt its effects.. and want to feel those effects again.  It is also one of those drugs that only take one use to be addictive.|`|AA10867743	Ask Jeeves.|`|AA10787247	the things in it make it addictive?|`|3443f687ea0792edf6d09d10c73f2737aa	sure
bf83b2dae9552e3005617934e18f45b7aa	Its always hard to say how one medication will effect each individual person. There are side effects to almost every medication on the market.I think asking people their opinion can be dangerous. The majority of people don't really know what they are talking about and that is how misinformation is past along. You need to make sure that you are being prescribed any psychiatric medication from a specialist not a general practitioner this could avoid much wasted time. Antidepressants fall into various classifications SSRI,SSNRITricylic, MAOI's.....etc. Lexapro is a newer generation of Paxil., and is prescribed for depression with anxiety. I am imagining the Effexor (for depression) gave you a much more stimulating effect. You really need to understand your depression, what type, its severity, and when accompanied by anxiety you really need to understand where the anxiety stems from. Anxiety can be a symptom  of depression as well depression can be caused by anxiety. Sometimes there is no one pill for the cure.I have been working in this field for 15 years and I have dealt with both for many years and have learned that medication  alone is not always the cure but a tool to aid in the cure while working with a mental health proffessional.   Currently I have been trying a new medication Cymbalta and  it    is awsome! (keep my fingers crossed ) I take a benzodiazapine for my anxiety as needed. My anxiety is situational and I dont allways need medication.   Unfortunately, its hit and miss with medication and there are so many out there. Just remember before you give up on any one medication to try it at least 1 to 2 months and never stop taking it without letting your Dr. know. I wish you all the best!|`|AA12097242	Lexapro is like Celexa, and the side effects are normal. after about one month you will feel better and not be as tired and the headaches are unrelenting, horrible, won't go away!  the first few weeks are really tough to get through.  There are other side effects, like sweating, change in taste, diarrhea and what not, but if they dont subside then see your doc again as you may need to adjust your dosage. Good luck.|`|AA11978907	Main thing for me - I refuse to take anything with the side effect of weight gain.  Not only being depressed, but being depressed also over being overweight.    I have been on many many medications|`|22c523f032b607cd3680b1a500c1d982aa	I was put on about 20mg of Lexapro a while back, and it worked (and still does) wonderfully. Though not all pills work the same for everyone. Though I cannot say the same for Effexor; everyone I knew, who was on it, got worse and it's symptoms where just as bad. Good luck on your search.|`|16f205d3bb18f0a92e3b264ad8614cdfaa	Lexapro is a anti depression medication, classified as a SELECTIVE SSRI this means less side effects and better than Zoloft, the side effects will subside shortly. Good Luck|`|c90eb233b7ca57f0b86baed6e95d486caa	Yeah-Zoloft did that to me too. I took lexapro once and it was okay. i did not have side effects but it really did not help that much. My drug of choice(lol) is Prozac. I have been taking it since 1987 on and off. Its the only thing that helps without all the side effects. My husband takes Cymbalta He says it really helps him, but i have never tried it.|`|8963a1e982fc70801b854c147dff31b6aa	I would talk to your doctor.  I don't think that is normal.  I was on Lexapro for a month for depression and it helped me.   But it doesn't sound like it's helping you.  Maybe ask if you can try Paxil or something.  It is a more generic brand.  Good luck!|`|6df4097400362ee8bfc71e8546d6d8b1aa	I don't know about Laxapro but my friend is on Geodon and she doing very well.|`|AA10488592	I started a pan of meat on the stove...then walked away.

Whenever I took it, I was at an all time high, but as soon as it started fading away, I went lower than before... The effects are too extreme and sudden.

e61d9614bc5b03f216f18c28ecde0afbaa	I have a few suggestions for you.     With any serious illness, I think  if possible patients should read everything about their disorder and make sure that they agree that the descriptions match their situation. Also read everything about the available medications.     My opinion is that there are many practitioners who can treat cases that are fairly routine, but there are very few who can treat stubborn cases. I seem to recall that there is a facility, perhaps in New Jersey, that treats the 15% or so of the cases that do not respond easily to medication. Unfortunately I do not recall specific information, but I think it is important for you to locate the big wigs in the area of mood disorders and seek their assistance.|`|AA10746836	IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO FIND THE RIGHT MEDICATION OR COMBINATIONS OF.

07b6caecedf6b4b2efd9f912a690752caa	Hello, interesting question you got there.    Okay, as a martial arts practitioner myself, i can only say that yes, it does help to a certain extent, however, it also depends on your opponent.     Most fights i've seen outside, even jackie chan can't handle, because most fights would turn into a hair grabbing, ramming, crazy swings, wild punches, and trying-my-luck kicking. The only thing your boxing lessons will teach is the appropriate method to block and strike if your opponent is either wide open, or sane enough to stand there and fight with you.     Other than that, i would say your boxing lessons, would be mainly for just the very basic of self defence. Try fighting a drunk, you can throw everything you got at him, he will just stand up and keep coming at you like a zombie.     If you really want a martial arts that would be useful and helpful in fighting, practice something which is purely defensive, e.g Aikido, Judo, or if you'll be the one starting all the fights, then go all the way aggressive, like the traditional kick-boxing of thailand, muay thai, however, in sg, i haven't seen any real muay thai schools yet.|`|39e140f03634fd53b30a11007af6e9cfaa	Not entirely, you're assuming that the fight will be set up exactly like your boxing lesson.  However, it might give you extra confidence since you know that you are able to defend yourself.|`|1ed6375beb5e8d962bce480e6040bc0caa	Well let see... learning to box ... boxing is the art of fighting.   hmm ...  if you learn the style of boxing and you gain control over your swinging action.  Learning to be in control of your jabs... maybe boxing can help you in a fight.   Make sense to me.   How about you?    Besides that you will gain muscles, control of your emotions, you will learn to jab, swing and upper cut.  Understand the actions of your opponent.   How to counter swing his swinging action.    Is this making any sense to you?    Go learn to box.  Have fun and work hard.|`|AA10438186	Yes... They are very hepful............  for the othe guy...

First, if the other guy is an expert in Shotokan Karate, then you'll probably be fu.cked.    Anyway, boxing will help you become tougher (if you actually box other people), and it will help you become quicker by throwing punch combinations, but the thing you have to remember is that a real fight is a STREET fight, not a boxing match, so anything goes.    So basically, if you're looking for a style that will help you on the street, boxing might help, but it's not your best bet.|`|AA11244170	It will all depend on who you are fighting.  If you are looking for a well rounded style go with Jujitsu or some form of submission type approach

Patients currently cannot and probably never will simply be able to take a pill that will make them stop smoking. Smokers must want to stop smoking and must be willing to work hard to achieve the goal of smoking abstinence    It is important for clinicians to moderate some of the potential enthusiasm that is likely to occur as the result of the publication of these trials, FDA approval of the drug, and promotion by this manufacturer. On the one hand, these studies demonstrate that varenicline is associated with higher smoking cessation rates than placebo and may produce better cessation rates than bupropion(wellbutrin), a first-lineapproved smoking cessation drug. Importantly, varenicline represents a third class of drug with probably a different mechanism of action than either nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion. On the other hand, varenicline definitely is not a panacea for smoking cessation. Many participants in these trials experienced adverse events, stopped taking their study medication before they should have, and discontinued participation in the studies.

It's currently in the phase III of testing, the last step before applying to the FDA.     Zyban, originally designed to treat depression is the current latest anti-smoking pill available now. You probably saw the story about Varenicline on Fox. I found a link with the story they ran. I hope this helps.  Here's an article outlining Pfizer's take on the new pill.

AA10046040	The contraceptive sponge, marketed in the U.S. under the brand "Today," combines barrier and spermicidal techniques to prevent conception.    The sponges are inserted vaginally prior to intercourse, and must be placed over the cervix to be effective. An elastic band across the sponge is present to facilitate removal.    Effectiveness for prevention of pregnancy when used correctly is about 89% to 91%, but can be used in conjunction with a condom making the contraceptive sponge as effective as any other reversible method of contraception. When improperly applied without the use of a condom its effectiveness is somewhere around 84% to 89%.

f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Start by eating smaller portions...you can still have what your parents make but do this:  Half the food on your plate should be veggies...always...cut back and eat just half of the fatty stuff...c'mon you know what's not good for you!    Do not drink sugary drinks...no juice (just a bit of OJ in the morning!) drink milk with meals (1 percent if you can) and water the rest of the time...no junk foods in between meals...if you must snack it's a fruit, a banana is good, an apple, celery and carrots as much as you want.    Now get up and do something...put music on and dance at least 20 minutes every day...try to walk a good 20 minutes every day too...and then add more activity and don't just sit around...you will lose weight really fast the more you keep moving and doing stuff...but cut back your portions and stick to eating less potatoes, bread, pasta, no gravies if you can avoid them they are really fattening...and you will do good.    Look up "Children's Nutrition" or "Daily Food Intake for Children" in google and get more info too.

Cuando se usa un sustituto de nicotina, disminuyen los sintomas de abstinencia.    Aunque un gran numero de fumadores es capaz de abandonar el habito sin el reemplazo de nicotina, la mayoria de los fumadores no tienen exito en el primer intento. De hecho, los fumadores por lo general necesitan hacer varios intentos (algunas veces tantos como 8 a 10) antes de que puedan  dejar el habito por siempre.    La falta de exito esta a menudo relacionada con la aparicion de los sintomas de abstinencia. Los fumadores que quieren dejar de fumar tienen mejores posibilidades de lograrlo cuando se reducen estos sintomas con el uso de la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina.    Metodos para obtener el maximo resultado con el reemplazo de nicotina    Debido a que la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina trata unicamente los aspectos fisicos de la adiccion, no se espera que se use como unico motodo para ayudar al fumador. Esta debe combinarse con otros metodos que traten el componente psicologico, por ejemplo, un programa para dejar de fumar. Los estudios han demostrado que, cuando se combina el reemplazo de nicotina con asistencia psicologica para cambiar el comportamiento, se pueden duplicar sus probabilidades de abandonar el habito.    La US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Practice Guideline on Smoking Cessation recomienda la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina para todos los fumadores, excepto para las embarazadas y las personas que padecen de enfermedades del corazn o del sistema circulatorio. Si un mdico recomienda el reemplazo de nicotina bajo estas circunstancias, los beneficios de abandonar el habito deben sobrepasar el riesgo potencial para la salud. Las fumadoras que estn embarazadas y los fumadores que padezcan del corazn deben consultar a su mdico antes de usar el tratamiento de reemplazo de nicotina de venta sin receta.      El momento ms adecuado para iniciar la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina es al empezar a tratar de abandonar el cigarrillo. No obstante, a menudo los fumadores intentan dejar de fumar primero por s mismos, y luego deciden probar la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina.       Esta terapia no debe usarse si usted piensa continuar fumando o consumir otro producto derivado del tabaco. La dosis de nicotina combinada pudiera ser perjudicial para su salud.    Tipos de sustitutos de nicotina    La Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ha aprobado cinco tipos de terapias de reemplazo de nicotina.    Los parches de nicotina (sistema transdermico de nicotina): los parches proveen una dosis medida de nicotina a travs de la piel. A medida que se disminuyen las dosis de nicotina al cambiar los parches en el transcurso de varias semanas, usted va dependiendo menos de la nicotina. Los parches pueden comprarse sin receta. Existen varios tipos de parches de diferentes concentraciones en el mercado. En el paquete se ofrecen instrucciones sobre como usar el producto, asi como consideraciones especiales y la descripcin de los posibles efectos secundarios.        * El parche de 16 horas funciona bien para las personas que fuman poco y para el fumador promedio. Ademas, este parche tiende a causar menos efectos secundarios, tales como irritacion de la piel, palpitaciones aceleradas, dificultades para dormir y dolor de cabeza. Sin embargo, no provee nicotina durante la noche, por lo que no es util para tratar los sintomas de la abstinencia que se presentan temprano en la ma?ana.        * El parche de 24 horas provee una dosis constante de nicotina, lo que evita las altas y bajas. Este tipo de parche alivia los sintomas de abstinencia que ocurren temprano en la ma?ana. Sin embargo, puede producir mas efectos secundarios, tales como interrupciones del patrn de sue?o e irritacin de la piel.      Segn la corpulencia de la persona, la mayora de los fumadores debe empezar usando un parche de maxima concentracion (15-22 mg de nicotina) diariamente durante cuatro semanas, y despues un parche de menor concentracion (5-14 mg de nicotina) por otras cuatro semanas. El parche debe  aplicarse por la ma?ana en un area limpia y seca de la piel que no tenga mucho vello. Debe colocarse entre el cuello y la cintura, por ejemplo, en el brazo. La Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recomienda usar el parche por un total de tres a cinco meses. Sin embargo, algunos estudios han demostrado que el uso del parche durante ocho semanas o menos es tan eficaz como usarlo por mas tiempo.    Los efectos secundarios estan relacionados con:        * La dosis de nicotina.      * La marca del parche.      * Las caracteristicas individuales de la piel (tales como la tendencia de la persona de padecer de una reaccion de la piel a causa del parche).      * El tiempo que se use el parche.      * La forma de aplicar el parche.      Algunos efectos secundarios que pudieran ocurrir con el parche de nicotina:        * Irritaciones de la piel, tales como enrojecimiento y picazn.      * Mareos.      * Palpitaciones aceleradas.      * Dificultades para dormir o sue?os inusuales.      * Dolor de cabeza.      * Nausea.      * Vomitos.      * Rigidez y dolor muscular.

AA11349803	Digital is great! Expensive but great. No more waiting for developing, no more messy and dangerous chemicals, no more mislabeled films falling out of charts. Instant view, great diagnostic quality and easy sharing with insurance companies and other providers.    Scanners are fine, but there is still extra labor involved and the scanners need to be replaced often.    With digital, every person in the office can see the x-ray at the same time from any workstation. You can't do that with film.    Yes, the sensors are hard plastic and some patients complain about comfort, but it is something most technicians get good at eventually. Once the patient understands they are receiving far less radiation than with film, they are usually OK with the slight discomfort of a hard sensor.    Sensors cost between $1500 and $6000 each, along with software and technical support. It can cost a dental practice between $20,000 - $50,000+ to convert. I believe there is a return on investment fairly soon without the developer, duplication equipment, chemicals, film, darkroom space and TIME.    Cost is the biggest "con" along with patient comfort. I believe both can be recovered.|`|da8e88d85950b84af3692cd67ce32dbaaa	We use the Gendex DenOptix cordless system in our office. The sensors are the same size as traditional films. They fit in normal XCP holders. Once exposed, they need to be scanned. A darkroom is not required, but a room where you can turn the lights down is necessary for transferring them into the scanner. The sensors scan for about 1 to 4 minutes depending on how many and what size sensors you use. The diagnostic quality is great and theres many tools to use. Magnification, thermo-imaging, adjust the density, the computer even calculates any measurements you may need. Once all sensors have been scanned, you remove them from the scanner and leave them out in the light for at least 4 minutes to clear the previous image. Very easy to use. The only con is not getting as instant of an image as the wired system. Other than that, we love it!|`|2919d242ac98cdc983f9377a292ea310aa	Personally don't use it, but I have asked Dentists that I know about it and they use it when the are performing root canals.  They say it is good as you can adjust the image and it is fast to use.  But they also say that for diagnosing small carious lesions they prefer the old system as they get better contrast.|`|d0b7fc7d57763e6200ff5e46906ef8d5aa	I have used the digital x-rays, and I can say it is GREAt in the aspect of you see your picture on the screen about 5 seconds after you push the button, rather than waiting 4 minutes for it to be developed.  But they are harder to manuver the sensor and keep it in place.  I also did not like the fact that you have to cover the sensor every time with the balloon. Compared to just grabing a mount or snap a ray.  Also sometimes you cannot see little detail as well.|`|AA10896144	I've had digital x-rays taken recently and for the most part they're a lot better than the traditional x-rays.  It's a little tough to keep perfectly still for a few seconds--but the result is so clear.  Also, and maybe it was just my imagination, but it seemed to take a bit longer (meaning I had to take more) x-rays... again the clarity of the x-rays and the lack of radiation exposure were well worth it.
AA12206399	Yes, celery is one of the few foods where it takes more energy to digest it than what you get. So theoretically, you could starve to death sitting next to a mountain of celery.    I recently read that watermelon may also be in the same category.    But don't expect to lose massive amounts of weight by going on a "celery" only a diet. You'll only feel deprived and wind up with severe vitamin / mineral deficencies.|`|AA11124885	If you are alive then you are constantly burning calories.  Celery supposedly does take more calories to digest than it provides though.|`|AA11620170	Celery is made of mostly insoluble fibre (cellulose), digesting cellery and disposing of the insoluble fibre is supposed to burn more calories than the celery provides.

Just be careful if the unit gets hot or the steam is hot that it's far enough away from the baby and in a spot where baby can't get burned on it.  I also liked the baby bath products like Johnson's soothing vapor bath.  Unfortunately, there's not much you can do but wait it out...If it lasts more than a few days, see a doctor.

If the infant's skin is not too sensitive, use some warm rub, such as Vicks    Depending on how old the infant is, you may want to administer de-congestion. However, please get proper advise.|`|ad6de655f8f3731155cf09a60038f47aaa	Vicks Vaporizer (the humidifier, not the Vapor rub) or Humidifier. Check out this one: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...  You can also combine with the use of Little Noses Saline Drops for Infants. Just put a few drops in the nose, and get your blue bulb suction thingy and try to suction out baby's nasal passage a bit. They don't like it, but it does clear them up for a while.    Lot's of TLC really goes a long way, too!
AA11052252	Your doctor is the one taking you off the meds, correct? Because you shouldn't remove yourself from them on your own. Usually there is a  weaning period where they will slowly bring you off of them. If they think you are o.k. to be without them you should be fine. The problem with not taking them anymore for some people is because they quit taking them on their own when they're aren't ready and all those old feelings come creeping back. Your personality shouldn't change though...maybe your moods a bit while you adjust, but you should be fine.|`|419e0c9d89b7280d29d893d8fb1dd4e8aa	Depends on what  tablets..your taking.. !!!|`|AA10026791	I believe you have to slowly be weened off of antidepressants because they are highly addictive.

e6f1de5544fee8deac05b3eed1aa1567aa	This is a good thing.  As long as you listen to your body and don't overdo the workouts.  Make sure you give yourself a day off each week to rest and let your body recover.  If you feel you must do something, then walk! It's great that you are enjoying working out and that will benefit you in ways that you could never imagine.  If you enjoy it and really put the effort into it, your results will be 100% better than if you workout half heartedly.  Watch for signs of overtraining:  restlessness at night, exhaustion, moodiness, headaches, lack of appetite, etc.  If you start experiencing these, back off a bit, take a few days off to rest.  Overtraining can result in illness and injury.  Good luck and take care!|`|46465463e9a9114f6aea1c68a978589daa	When you exercise you body releases endorphins which give your brain pleasure - a feeling of well being that makes you want to repeat whatever caused it, in your case, exercise.|`|AA11124885	That's great!

If you find that you are taking them everynight, talk to your doctor.    As for being obsessed with exercise, well... I think that anyone who actually gives it a try for any length of time will be. Exercise releases endorphines into your blood, basically giving you a "high" and who doesn't love looking hotter? As long as you are eating healthy, too, not being some anorexic treadmill junky, keep it up! Exercise is good for you!!|`|AA10639444	In response to the pain reliever for muscle soreness:    You must remember that your body knows best. I don't take pain relievers for muscle soreness so that I'm aware of how much recuperation is needed. Your body also lets you know what you should be limited to as far as physical activity while you are sore.     Since building mass is ever so important to men who weight lift, I recommend not using pain killers unless it's an important event that you can't be distracted for. But if it's a night out anywhere it's good to know what activities might be damaging some of that tissue beyond the point where you lose the benefits of lifting - since the muscle needs to be repaired before it can grow.    As far as being obsessed - I'd use different phrasing and say that you're really motivated by the successes you've made so far. There's no greater inspiration than seeing the fruits of your labor like that.    Good luck with everything.|`|2e99ce653a8f4ec486412ef169b3ac59aa	at one time i worked out a whole month straight without a day off to me thats not an obsession. i just like ok i love working out, i feel great after. if you feel good after than go for it, however if you feel pain you may be overdoing it thats why they say check with your physicianb4 starting any program.  you can take advil or motrin for muscle pain, follow the instructions. i have an urge to work out and i do, i do 6 days a week.now if it takes over the rest of your life and all you do is think eat and breathe working out then youre obsessed. you have to have balance.|`|b5c8b2d12684c5b6b1a3a708377050fcaa	its ok you just dont want to burn yourself out or get dicouraged when you plateau|`|004ede6b7f7907a095fe37ac75a458cfaa	Good for you...go for it.

If you were really obsessed or addicted you wouldn't be online asking this question...you'd be at the gym :o)    With the pain relievers, I don't think you're doing yourself justice.   If you sprain yourself & don't give yourself rest, in the long run you'll injure yourself permanently.  Get a personal trainer and ask him or her to show you a high-intensity workout designed specifically for your body and your fitness level. That way you'll feel like you've gotten your work out for the day.

Are you sexually active, or are you still a virgin? Also, do you use a tampon during the first couple of days of your period? I quit using them and just let the blood flow freely and it seemed to help somewhat.  I have no medical basis to back up what I am telling you, or am I telling you to lose your virginity if you are a virgin. All I can think of is that the penis being thrust into me may have done something to the position of my uterus,  and may have helped lessen my pain during menstruation. This may gross you out, but I would get the most relief if I had intercourse during the first couple of days of my period, it hurt me but, it also helped me a lot. Your partner may be disgusted by the idea, but maybe he would be willing to try to see if you get any relief.  As I said, I have no medical basis as to why this helped me, all I know is that it did, so take it for what it is worth.

If you want lower, just add green leafys and cut out the starchies.    I got this mainly from the Zone diet book, but the library link at www.hufa.org gives info on other diet books.

Thats not very many.  So make sure that when you deside to eat something starchy...that its what you really want.    Sugars and Starches are NO NOs.        Get you carbs from veggies and fruit if you can.  Limit your fruit, even if its fresh...Increase your protein....with meat(non processed like lunchmeat or hotdogs), eggs and cheese.      The body burns carbs and if you dont burn it....it gets stored.  so the less you take in...the more fat reserve you will have to burn because the body cant find ingested carbs to burn.  If you will introduce exercise...even walking....you will lose the weight.    Also remember...that if you reduce your carb intake you will be hungry more often.  EAT!....just dont eat carbs....protein...and more protein.

AA10498711	Try Tricep extensions.  Get a dumbbell (8, 10, or whatever you can handle), reach over your head, raise and lower the weight behind your head.  Try to keep your elbows close to your ears to work the muscle more.|`|AA11096432	My ideas? Try to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. Work hard, but don't over 60 minutes at a time. Do planks and other abs exercises on alternate days.    On training days, do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.    The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!    Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.

335d764fe76277d504f6d6e8dfb580a2aa	Getting rid of fat in general, building lean muscle, and defining your physique is 60% diet, 30% exercise, and 10% mental thought. You must eat the right foods, exercise more often than you don't, burn more calories than you consume, think and speak positively about yourself, try making life as stress free as possible, and get rest so that your body can repair itself.    Portion control is key to reaching your goal. You don't want to over-eat. A portion should be the size of your fist. Meals should consist of one portion of carbohydrates and protein, and a portion of fat (is: a handful).     Carbohydrates:   Apples, Bananas, Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Mangos, Pineapple, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Celery, Carrots, Broccoli, Asparagus, Green Beans, Sweet Potatoes, Corn, Steel Cut Oatmeal, Whole "Grain" Bread.    Protein: Egg Whites, Salmon, Tuna, Halibut, Chicken Breasts, Lean Ground Turkey, Turkey Breasts, Protein Powder, Protein Bars (Power Crunch Bar, Cliff Builder Bar) You don't want a high calorie, high fat, high sugar bar. The two I listed are good ones, and they taste great too!    Fat: Organic Peanut Butter, "Raw" Almonds or Walnuts, Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing. (Only consume a handful of nuts, with your breakfast, lunch, and dinner.) Fats help with digestion.    You want to have 4-5 small meals per day. 2-3 hours apart. You will never go hungry and your metabolism will not slow down!Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed. If possible get 8 hours of sleep, this plays a major role in losing belly fat.    Meal Planning: (Preparation is key.)    Meal 1: Protein, Carb, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)  Meal 2: Protein shake or bar (A glass of WATER)  Meal 3: Protein, Carb, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)  Meal 4: Protein shake or bar (A glass of WATER)  Meal 5: Protein, Carb, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)    Drink half of your weight (or more) in oz. of water per day.  (ex: 120lbs = drink 60oz. of water per day.)    Exercise: (Arrange this plan to fit your schedule).    Mon- light weights upper body, 30-60 min cardio, and abs  Tue- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)  Wed- light weights lower body, 20-30 min cardio, and abs  Thu- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)  Fri- light weights upper body, 30-60 min cardio, and abs  Sat- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)    Its important to sign up to a gym, perhaps get a workout partner/personal trainer it offers motivation.     This is my plan that I have made after doing research.It has worked for me, and I've helped friends lose weight this way! If you stick with it, it eventually becomes a lifestyle. If you are going to eat junk food, do it in moderation. Eventually you won't even crave it.I like to keep my diet as natural and organic as possible. Multivitamins are also a good idea, just to help strengthen your immune system.

It will pump up your heart rate which will then speed up your fat burning process and kick start your metabolism. Also changing your eating habits while your on a diet. For example days you do higher protein do more weight training and days you do more carbs do more cardio. Drink plenty of water at least 64oz. Shock your body try a internal cleanser for a few days. Don't stress. Get plenty of sleep. And stop using the word diet. it's a mental thing just take your time and make small changes daily and you will notice results. Most important...Have Fun

AA11188770	Your heart is pumping faster from the workout pushing the blood up to your face where it feels it is needed. The heart is trying to feed the part that seems to be lacking: the brain.

When you work out your blood is pumped around a lot more than if you are just sitting around. To make room for this you vessels open up more, and also are pushed closer to the surface of your skin, this contributes to the redness. Pale skin tend to be more transluscent, compared to darker skin. I've also been told that people with Scottish backgrounds will tend to turn red easier. I have some Scottish in me, so maybe so.

That heat can really promote muscle relaxation.  (We are talking muscle spasm here.)  In labor they keep telling you to breathe...it gives oxygen to the uterus muscle....so try breathing deeply?  Any pressure on the uterus is really painful so an empty colon can be important.  Try stool softeners early on and some sort of big laxative during pain like x-lax or glycerine suppositories or those fleets enemas?   Couldn't hurt to try once, anyway.  The big medicine you get from your doctor..muscle relaxants, valium, and anything with codeine in it.  Why not?  What are you paying him for?  If he cannot give you real help  for real pain then he must refer you to a pain doctor.  Trust me that those guys are not afraid to give you what helps, but you got to have a referal.  Mention suicidal thoughts during peak pain periods to get attention.  Good luck?|`|AA12342090	I think you need to see the doctor and see what he / she can suggest.

Maybe you will tolerate those better than the oral form.  There is not much else that can be done if it truly is just the dysmenorrhea.

Ask your doctor.|`|994e533f9f9f88637b2a581b4317468daa	Heating pads. Exercise. I was just DX with PCOS not too long ago (that sounds alot like some symptoms of it)and the specialist told me that pretty much the only way to control it is with birth control, and that if you cannot tolerate pills, that the IUD is the next best thing because it is inserted into your uterus, and delivers very small amounts of hormone continuously without any systemic reactions (it only puts hormones in the uterus, not the rest of the body). I would try that if I were you. The only other thing that worked for me was 800mg Motrin, but, if the side effects of it are more bothersome than the problem than they aren't worth the pain. Good luck|`|AA11420267	Drink more water. Some time exercise help. The thermocare that get hot and can wear them for eight hours. Help me a lot! You can get them at Wal-Mart.

It's hard to tell someone you had to miss work because of cramps. But I know where you are coming from. I spend at least one day a month in bed wishing I'd die.     I have heard that acupunture can help (though I haven't tried it myself). Also, regular exercise and a good diet are supposed to help along with plenty of rest. I haven't found those things to be very helpful - but everyone is different.    Have you tried different oral contraceptives? I know that there are several different types and they all have different features and benefits, so to speak.    The only thing that helps me is heat. If I absolutely have to be at work I wrap myself in a heating pad and try not to move. This sounds strange, but you know those sticky heat pads (that stick to your body and stay warm for several hours)? I have bought the ones that you are supposed to stick on your back and stuck them to my abdomen - and it helped quite a bit.    I don't know of any remedies to prevent the onset of dysmenorrhea. Good luck to you.|`|AA10276550	I used to have serious problems with my period. My doctor gave me heavy-duty pain killers and a pill so I'd only have my cycle every 4 months. That seemed to do the trick. Only problem now is that I can't drive while menstruating. How funny is that?|`|AA11420628	If you tell me the following, I will be better able to advise:   - how old you are   - is your period very heavy when you are NOT on birth control pills?  - how long did you stay on the birth control pills when you took them?    I agree with the person who said it might be endometriosis. This is when the lining of the uterus pops up in places where it cannot be flushed out of the body when your period happens. Therefore, it can be very painful.    The reason I ask if you have had kids is there is another option called Mirena. It is a hormone-containing IUD. It is like birth control pills in that it stops your endometrium from thickening and resulting in a large menstrual flow (thus solving your blood clot problem.) The good part about Mirena is that it is only "local effect," i.e. it only affects your uterus (which sounds like the focus of your problems) and the area around it with very, very low dose of hormones. Therefore, you won't have the illness you had with birth control pills (although if you stick with birth control pills more than 3 months, you probably would find that the illness goes away). You might try what the other respondent mentioned - birth control pills straight through for 3 months to reduce the painful periods to once every 3 months (or even longer - there is now a "yearly" pill where you have one period a year.) However, you still have to go through the acclimatization period when you start. You are the best one to decide whether 3 months of "morning sickness" type illness is worth it to remove your monthly pain.    One other good thing: some women end up not having ANY bleeding after inserting Mirena, so that is an added bonus.    Anyway, it is something to discuss with your old doc or your new doc. IUD's got a bad rap a long time ago with the Dalkon Shield problems, but there has been a lot of improvement since then, and if you ask European women what they use after having kids it is mostly IUD's.    Hope that helps.

AA11423523	Could be lots of reasons.  Vasectomy's are only 90% accurate, and although it's not likely, the best way to rule out pregnancy is to take a home pregnancy test.      Other reasons could be:               * early menopause (I'm not sure how old you are),               * other hormonal problems              * stress              * something more serious - a viral infection or disease              * cramps, nausea & lack of periods could all be totally                        unrelated.              * cysts on your ovaries - my friend had this and had all                        these symptoms and had to have them surgically                       removed immediately.    I suggest you consult a doctor urgently who can do more tests, because absence of periods is definately not normal & you don't want to go on having cramps & nausea.  It could be something more serious, and it's really important that you find out as soon as possible.|`|AA10995540	well, for under five dollars, the pregnant question can be answered. so I say go get a etp|`|AA12135982	go to the doc, and there is still a change a man can get a women pregnant with a vastectomy. go to planned parenthood.|`|b584a6f3653eb76ef53e6f96aa0398b1aa	Definately go to a doctor.

There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges all types of medical treatment and surgery for foreigners in India. They are called the Forerunners Healthcare. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. I have also read that they arrange financing for American and Canadian patients, as some of the surgery including ivf treatment is not covered by insurance.    They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. The cost savings are incredible. As a doctor I personally believe that your treatment and surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world. The doctors are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star. I recently also read about a Chinese couple facilitated by forerunners healthcare were able to get their baby by IVF and a surrogate mother.    My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full treatment for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.I strongly recommend this company to you as they can be of great help to you. Hope this helps.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com

You must eat the right foods, exercise more often than you don't, burn more calories than you consume, think and speak positively about yourself, try making life as stress free as possible, and get rest so that your body can repair itself.    Portion control is the key to reaching your goal. You don't want to over-eat. A portion should be the size of your fist. Meals should consist of one portion of carbohydrates and protein, and a portion of fat (is: a handful).     Carbohydrates: Apples, Bananas, Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Mangos, Pineapple, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Celery, Carrots, Broccoli, Asparagus, Green Beans, Sweet Potatoes, Corn, Steel Cut Oatmeal, Whole "Grain" Bread.    Protein: Egg Whites, Salmon, Tuna, Halibut, Chicken Breasts, Lean Ground Turkey, Turkey Breasts, Protein Powder, Protein Bars (Power Crunch Bar, Cliff Builder Bar) You don't want a high calorie, high fat, high sugar bar. The two I listed are good ones, and they taste great too!    Fat: Organic Peanut Butter, "Raw" Almonds or Walnuts, Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing. (Only consume a handful of nuts, with your breakfast, lunch, and dinner.) Fats help with digestion.    You want to have 4-5 small meals per day. 2-3 hours apart. You will never go hungry and your metabolism will not slow down. Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed. If possible get 8 hours of sleep, this plays a major role in losing belly fat.    Meal Planning: (Preparation is key.)    Meal 1: Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)  Meal 2: Protein shake or bar (A glass of WATER)  Meal 3: Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)  Meal 4: Protein shake or bar (A glass of WATER)  Meal 5: Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat (1 bottle of WATER)    Drink half of your weight (or more) in oz. of water per day.  (ex: 120lbs = drink 60oz. of water per day-or more.)    Exercise: (Arrange this plan to fit your schedule).    Mon- light weights upper body, 30-60 min cardio, and abs  Tue- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)  Wed- light weights lower body, 20-30 min cardio, and abs  Thu- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)  Fri- light weights upper body, 30-60 min cardio, and abs  Sat- cardio 60 minutes (power walk, run, elliptical, etc.)    Its important to sign up to a gym, perhaps get a workout partner/personal trainer it offers motivation.     This is my plan that I have made after doing research. It has worked for me, and I've helped friends lose weight this way! If you stick with it, it eventually becomes a lifestyle. If you are going to eat junk food, do it in moderation. Eventually you won't even crave it.I like to keep my diet as natural and organic as possible. Multivitamins are also a good idea, just to help strengthen your immune system.    If you are looking for a health book that offers more information on food, fitness, meal planning, and motivation; I am a big fan of the "Body-for-LIFE" book as well as the "Eating-for-LIFE" cookbook both written by, Bill Phillips. It is what got me where I am today, living a healthy and satisfying life.     There is also a great website: http://www.fitday.com  FitDay is a free online diet and weight-loss journal.

You didn't say how much weight you wanted to lose five pounds or less.  You could try fasting one day and than eat smaller portions plus exercise.

50bd83ba59089225b824d8637c543f41aa	A muscle fiber (AE) or muscle fibre (BE) (also technically known as a myocyte) is a single cell of a muscle. Muscle fibers contain many myofibrils, the contractile unit of muscles. Muscle fibers are very long; a single fiber can reach a length of 30cm.    Muscle fibres can be grouped according to what kind of tissue they are found in -- skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle fibers can be further divided into two basic types, type I (slow-twitch fibers) and type II (fast-twitch fibers). The muscle cells of heart muscle tissue are called cardiomyocytes.    Type I    Type I muscle fibers (slow-oxidative fibers) use primarily cellular respiration and, as a result, have relatively high endurance. To support their high-oxidative metabolism, these muscle fibers typically have lots of mitochondria and myoglobin, and thus appear red or what is typically termed "dark" meat in poultry. Type I muscle fibers are typically found in muscles of animals that require endurance, such as chicken leg muscles or the wing muscles of migrating birds (e.g., geese).  [edit]    Type II    Type II muscle fibers use primarily anaerobic metabolism and have relatively low endurance. Due to their low-oxidative demand, these muscle fibers have low levels of mitochondria and myoglobin, and thus appear white. These muscle fibers are typically used during tasks requiring short bursts of strength, such as sprints or weightlifting. Type II muscle fibers cannot sustain contractions for significant lengths of time, and are typically found in the white meat (e.g., the breast) of chicken.    There are two sub-classes of type II muscle fibers, type IIa (Fast-Oxidative) and IIb (Fast-Glycolytic). Type IIb (Fast-Glycolytic) tire the fastest, and are the prevalent type in sedentary individuals. Some research suggests that these subtypes can switch with training to some degree.    The biochemical difference between the three types of muscle fibers is their myosin heavy chains.|`|61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	cardiomyocytes~a single cell of a muscle. muscle fibers contain many myofibrils, the contracting unit of muscles. muscle fibers can reach a length of 30cm.  muscle fibers can be classified according to what kind of tissue they are found in~the muscle cells of heart muscle tissue are called "cardiomyocytes"~the muscular tissue of the heart~the myocardium is composed of special cardiac muscle cells with an ability unlike any muscle tissue elsewhere in the body. cardiac muscle, like other muscles, can contract, but it can also conduct electricity, like nerves.|`|6c2984cc31b7ebcccbe68db53a6ee56faa	Heart muscle cells.|`|bbdf501a16cf75dd35decd3830fc25ccaa	Cardiac myocyte : striated muscle cells found in the heart; derived from cardiac myoblasts and function in contracting the heart.|`|b52cbe3234e21b4b22c9b8e990318dfeaa	they sound like cells that are found in the heart

Then as others have said keep fresh fruit and vegtables that he likes around.  If you'll cut them up, peel and slice the way he likes it he'll eat more of the good stuff, which won't hurt him.|`|AA10299042	No. By figuring out what's really eating him.  Sit him down, pay attention to what's going on in his life.  Listen when he talks to friends and thinks you aren't listening.  Food + Love to some kids. Where is his dad??  tell your son how awesome he is, and how you can't imagine life without him.   Point out his great qualities.  Say "Good Morning" every day, and kiss his head goodnight.  Let him know that you feel his pain, and you are always there or him.  Just when you think you can't love anymore than you do, love more.  My son has this problem. I have him playing Frisbee with me and my daughter at night.  He is also in gymnastics once a week. He is now  the age where he is becoming more concerned about his appearance. (I never thought it would happen!)  How does he feel about his weight?  Let him express without interrupting.  It can not hurt to let him know you care.|`|61a08eb8e5ac2510f4be0be70f94cbf8aa	A shrink, quick.|`|2d3072fbc26175ae61d63747fbd882cfaa	Only store healthy food at home.

SOmething is bothering him and maybe you should talk to him or if you can get him inot counseling. Just tell him you want him to talk to someone who can help him enjoy life better. I would just keep all healthy food in the house so when he does binge it will be good for him  good luck|`|AA10558237	Tell him not to be ashamed, to eat what he wants, when he wants. BUT he must not go over a certain amount of calories per day (eg 1500, you'll need to figure out what is normal for someone his age etc)    This should make him realise he can have what he wants but he needs to space it out a bit, and not go overboard.    Try and also make sure he has at least one decent meal, with veg in it.  If he's doing that he will be okay for now and it should settle down. If not, see a doc of course. He could be having emotional problems which he's trying to supress, or treat with eating. Either that or he's just got into a bad habit/ being greedy.    Has he got hobbies? Try to get him more active and interested in things    edit: from your added info, have you considered night eating sydrome? With this the person sometimes isn't even aware that they've eaten. They eat mostly late at night and "sleep eat" , that is get up, sleepwalk all the way to the kitchen and chow down. Then go right back to their bed. Mention it to his counsellor, there's a good chance his eating habits are related to his problems and they can work on that. Best of luck|`|aa8d207b8420ee744a946436ec3e0fb5aa	Why would you put him in a situation where he has to sneak around?  I believe anytime you limit food they will  focus on it.  I suggest getting rid of all high cal processed food.  No snacks, treats, hot dogs, processed meat like ham, and chips.  Fill the fridge with apples, oranges, healthy  low cal treats and let him eat his fill.  Take him to a Dr. and make sure his weight isn't the product of a medical condition.  If not, work with him in kindness.  Fix healthy nutricious meals for him.  If he doesn't like them, eventually he will, he'll get tired of being hungry and he'll start eating the healthy food.

However, these are very popular and people continue to use them without considering the adverse side effects. Prescription diet pills are useful for severe obesity problems. These pills are regulated and their side effects are monitored. Some of these pills are Meridia (Sibutramine), Xenical (Orlistat), Adipex, Bontril, Didrex, Phentermine and Tenuate. Xenical is a lipase inhibitor, decreasing fat absorption by 30% resulting in a lower calorie intake. These pills will not be effective for losing weight , if  a conventional weight loss plan is also not followed. More information on weight loss pills at http://www.toloseweight.org/weightlosspi...
AA11968070	I have no idea what you mean by "weakens".

AA10326029	YES, you're exactly right !!!    MUSCLE WEIGHS MORE THAN FAT BECAUSE IT HAS A DENSER MASS.    Therefore you may gain mass & you'll have the added benefit of looking better in (OR OUT OF) clothes & your clothes will even fit better.    I gave you a thumbs-up for a great question & GETTING FIT !!!    Replacing Fat With Lean Muscle By Exercising - How To Increase ...  Free articles and free reports archive.

Keep it up.|`|b61fcef0dd04e357302e226128fe052baa	You should never judge yourself by the scale, only by how your clothes fit.  If your clothes are getting loser but your are weighing the same that means you are losing body fat and gaining muscle.  Muscle weighs more than fat.  And something to keep in mind is that muscle does not take the place of fat.  What is really happening is that your fat cells are getting smaller and your muscle fibers are getting bigger.  Muscle is also leaner and more dense than fat which is why you could weigh more with muscle but look smaller.|`|0c30495e69f87261ccc305cb7be7b158aa	muscle weighs more than fat. so yes you have replaced it. but that is a healthier weight and a stronger weight. if you are that concerned about numbers then stay with strictly jogging, running...high cardio. do not do muscle toning or weight lifting. the cardio will tone you of course but will slim you better.|`|a3656635a6df5df98b8235d14f94a9c2aa	When you work out, you gain muscle....you may actually gain some lbs because muscle weighs more than fat, but it also burns fat...so you lose inches.....don't worry if the scale doesn't move though....as long as people are seeing the change...that means that what you're doing is working...and you probably feel better physically and mentally....so let go of the scale!!!!|`|AA10269450	Sure is, keep up the good work.|`|d89458e8db3edb0413f8bd3cbf1807c6aa	could be depends on your work out to lose pounds and build muscle at the same time you have to watch your diet and what you eat

Are you telling me if Carmen Electra knocked on your door, you couldn't have a nice night with her? Of course not. Engage in light, regular exercise, get enough sleep, and take a break from trying for a bit.|`|AA11880127	Stress can be a b*tch when it comes to your sex drive. But once the stressors are removed it can kick in just as quickly as it died down. So, take some time to relax and have some fun. Excercise in general is a good idea like these people said, but try to make it something you really enjoy, something exciting if possible. Instead of stressing in an office etc., get your adrenaline flowing in an environment in which you can act on it...adventure sports or something. Get off the couch and do things that make you feel aliiiive - virility tends to go hand in hand with that feeling. Get yourself some erotica, masturbate, fantasize...I'm sure you;ll find the fun in it again. I find that the more you get the more you want, so start off slow and I'm sure you'll build up steam in no time as long as you concentrate on the fun/pleasure, instead of getting depressed about the whole thing. And if none of that does it for you perhaps Viagra isn;t such a bad idea. Could help you get a taste for it again... ;-)|`|d6949fb8382f6d613675fa8d83093590aa	Around 35 to 40 your metabolism slows way down and you do not produce near the amount of testosterone as you did in your teens and twenty's.

Go to the Dr if you're concerned, sometimes a bit of depression can cause a low sex drive, esp if you have been working long hard hours for a while in a stressful job.  Try not to let it affect your socialising.....that will probably have a negative effect.  And remember, everyone probably has times in their life when their sex life is not how they would like it.  Good luck.

The first week that I started trying to be healthier I lost 10lbs, due mostly to water weight.  Drop out all sodas, period.

You could starve yourself, but you don't want to look sick on the day, do you?    If you cut out all starchy foods, you may not lose the entire 5 pounds but you will look as if you've lost more than you really have, because your stomach will go much flatter and you will tend to lose excess fluid in your system.      So the following diet will make you lose some weight, but will also make the best of your appearance:     - Drink lots of water, which will take the edge off your appetite, and will also counteract any dehydration from the diet.    - Have eggs for breakfast - no breads, no cereals.  You'll find the eggs fill you up.    - Have salads or steamed vegetables with meat, fish or seafood for lunch and dinner.  Have a big enough helping that you don't feel hungry - don't starve yourself.    - Have fruit for dessert.    - Coffee and tea with milk and sugar are OK.  No diet drinks containing phenylalanine, because they've been proven to make you feel hungry so you're more likely to break the diet.  No bread, cereals, nothing with sugar in it except the tea and coffee.      - try not to snack.    - take a multivitamin supplement.|`|AA11093708	just don't eat food. u might eat an apple, tomato, cucumber, smth like that, drink water or tea with no sugar. u might also try some  herbal teas for losing weight - they make u urinate and defecate too often. just rememebr - after this tea u should stay at home, close to loo.u may buy them in some nature shops and pharmacies.  im not sure how will u feel at a wedding, but who cares? at least u will look thin|`|7289007e2ed3c9bad8038db8ae08ea0aaa	try maximum liquid things Avoid milky food  do exercise regularly   eat smaller quantity after some times.take breakfast daily do yoga it is useful for maintain Ur weight at night walk 30 min. after eating dinner|`|d6e778ac0fddc2824e3d3ca6e76193a7aa	1.

Remember there are three different types of body type Endo, Ecto, Mesomorph. do some research and find out which one you are this will enable you to better reach your goal in adding lean muscle mass. good luck|`|AA10471526	To gain muscle:  -You need to eat at least 1 gram of protein for every pound you weigh each day (no more than 40 grams at a time). Drink lots of water to help your body process the protein better.  -You need to consistently work out with heavy weights and low reps to stimulate muscle growth (if you can do it more than 8 times, it's too light).   -You need to let your body totally recover before working out a particular muscle again (less is more when gaining).  -Take L-Glutamine at night to help keep your body from burning muscle.    To see abs:  -Eat less fat and sugar.  -Drink green tea every day (recent scientific research shows that green tea has potent fat burning properties).  -Do various stomach exercises including stomach vacuums (google it if you don't know) every other day (try to get them sore and give them a day to recover).    Good luck!|`|2c7d2811d6d972aab2fe02675e4fb916aa	At that body fat % you shouldnt have to lose any more weight to get the abs you want. I suggest doing weighted crunchs and weighted leg lifts.   You can add the mass you want if you can eat enough protein. Eating a diet high in protein very low in carbs and fat. This should help you to not gain much fat. Should you seem to put on fat that you dont want just try do some cardio.    Id suggest eating around 1-1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight.    For more info go to www.bodybuilding.com.

The definition of diet is eating right for weight training.  Do low impact cardio workout and light weights to start.  Eat 6 small meals a day.  alternate the meals from a carb meal to a protien meal.  do not mix the two.  Eat only good carbs, fruit, oatmeal or brown rice and eat greens with your protien.  Allow yourself 1 cheat day and dont over do it, this will help keep the temptation away and if you trianed  hard all week, you can treat yourself with an indulgence.  The six meals will keep your metabolism working all day, the low impact workout wll keep you burning fat all day.    You cannot spot loose fat, so excersice all you rmuscle groups.  Concentrating on your chest will not accelerate the program, but you may want to train chest an extra day a week.|`|179c1bb908324ff275fe30f56a1d7f4faa	Its fat around the breast tissue.

AA11465093	Diet pills, I don't really feel are going to work for you.  They either suppress appetite or increase metabolism.  You seem to have a very balanced and healthy diet and didn't mention any snacking problems, so an appetite suppressant isn't going to be your best bet.  You have done so much already to increase your metabolism already, that I doubt a pill is going to do much more.  If anything, maybe just drink a bit of green tea eith EGCG.  It'll increase metabolism, but it won't be much, so it's going to be safe.    A few suggestions/questions:  1. are you lifting weights on all the areas of your body, every work out?  To give your muscles a chance to grow, you need to let them rest at least one day, so you should alternate days or muscle groups each time for it to be effective.  Increased muscle can help speed up your metabolism.    2.  What is your body fat %?  If it is already low, losing more fat is going to be difficult, and you don't want to lose muscle.  Muscle is good!    3.  How do you feel?  Do you like your size and diet?  Is this 10 pound loss more about the number or a size that you are striving for?  If you are happy with your diet and your current size, there is no biggie about these vanity pounds.      4.  Is this a lifestyle you enjoy?  If you don't already enjoy it very much, limiting yourself more may help you lose the weight, but once you get back to an eating plan that you truly enjoy, you'll just put those 10 pounds right back on.    5.  How varied are your workouts?  If you are doing elliptical for an hour everyday, 6 days a week, your body is going to get used to the repetition and get bored and your workout won't be as affective.    6.  How much are you limiting your calories?  Do not, under any circumstances, consume less than 1200 calories per day.  Since you are so active, I might even say no less than 1500 cals.  Low calories and high activity level could make your body go into shock or survival mode, and it is going to hold on to each pound of fat that you have for dear life.    Play with your diet a little - try increasing it a little, try 6 meals instead of 5, don't eat after 7 pm, etc.  See if the weight loss changes.     In the end, if you have tried everything you can, it might be safe to assume that those pounds just aren't meant to come off. :)  Your body knows best, listen to it.    Good luck!|`|9b4c1f229e1c1f242f38ba2095758af5aa	maybe that's just how your body is supposed to be, not everyone has the same metabolism.     there are no right easy answers. diet pills do not ever help|`|806f8f193778accdbc6ab0c2b0cdf92faa	There are no diet pills that WORK WELL and AREN'T DAMAGING.

41eb1c7cd656169b509f23467450eb53aa	I did and stopped when I got pregnant, slowly the weight has come back. After my son stopped breastfeeding so much I started gaining and then started eating more sugar, flour, etc, now I'm back to where I was. It is the only diet that has ever worked for me that was pretty easy and I wasn't starving all the time. I hadn't been that thin since I was a teenager and I felt full of energy, clearheaded, amazing - and I conceived my son that way, remained on a low carb diet (NOT Atkins though) and he was my only full term baby after two preterm births, my weight gain was 28 lbs and he weighed 9 lbs at birth. My cholesterol went down and my glucose tests were improved over my prior pregnancies.    I'm starting it again this week, the first two weeks is so hard, especially the first week. I lost 14 lbs in two weeks, 22 lbs in 6 weeks before I had to stop. How much weight you lose dependson how much you have to lose, your gender, your metabolism, how much you exercise, etc.    However, I really only follow the Atkins diet during the first two weeks to break the sugar addiction, and I tend to eat more lean meat, fish and chicken instead of all that fat. I would say I follow a low carb plan rather than the Atkins diet.    Also, people are vehemently against Atkins, so I learned not to say that word. Say you are cutting out white flour, sugar and soda, everyone agrees with that. Or, just say you are following South Beach, that diet is so trendy even though it's basically the same plan except a low fat version where weight loss is a little slower, but same principle.|`|f6cbe48a48c200b731470d0d2dd118f1aa	Yes it is true But !!!....Low carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet typically exceed the safe limits set by the National Academy of Sciences for the consumption of cholesterol, fat, saturated fat and protein while being low in fibre and other dietary constituents. People who follow this diet increase their risk of potential cardiac, bone and liver abnormalities. There are no published studies on the long term effects of the Atkins diet. However there have been long term studies of similar diets or diets which are also high in animal protein and short term studies on the effects of low carbohydrate diets raised a number of issues.  In some studies 30% of people on low carbohydrate diets had an increase in cholesterol levels despite losing weight.  Long term daily consumption of meat is associated with a 3 times increase in colon cancer. From studies of the general population it has been shown that diets which are high in animal fats, over time, leads to a reduction in the function of the kidneys also diets which are high in animal protein are known to significantly increase urinary calcium loss even over a short period of time and as a result increase the risk of fractures. In the maintenance phase of the diet urinary calcium losses were 55% higher than normal. Good Luck.|`|60b0e01c20e84fcb6c62d2b59e3099ecaa	I have.

AA11542491	YES!|`|68e51ddfd810d6caeb656eff80706649aa	Actually you need more carbs than protein to help sustain your workouts. Protein helps to rebuild and repair the micro tears in the muscles from the weight training. Carbs are used as the major source of energy for your workouts. Protein needs can be meet with one gram per pound of body weight. So, your calorie % should look something like this, 50% carbs, 30% protein and 20% fats. May change that up a few percentage points in each cater gory, but stick close to those numbers. And be sure to chose healthy foods for all macro nutrients. I would avoid the circuit training, that's mainly for a higher heart rate workout. Stick with lifts that are multi-joint (involves more than one joint when doing a lift, i.e., squat) or another to look at it, lifts that use the most muscle mass. Be sure to work your entire body equally, especially your front and back. Good luck!!

It is 1 ml sterile isotonic solution containing 10 mg Dexpanthenol and 250 mg sea water.  It has to be taken according to doctor's instructions, who will explain how you should hold the bottle to spray both the nasal passages.     A puff before sleeping and a puff after you wake up, should  control your nose drip and help you sleep better.    If it is not easily available, you doctor can prescribe an alternative nasal spray. You should stop using it as soon as you feel better. I think it is cortisone and may have mild side effects like drowsiness. That is a risk if you are driving.    You might feel better in two weeks.

AA11382344	OK, I'm not wild about either of them.  I find step aerobics too hard on my knees (but I have a bad knee) and spinning bores me silly (but that's just me).    Positives:  Aerobics is more of a total-body workout while spinning is mostly lower-body.    Spinning likely burns more calories - but it will depend on the class.    Spinning is easier on your joints.    Negatives:  Aerobics requires more co-ordination    Spinning can be hard on your lower back if you don't get the bike adjusted just right.    If you're going to do an hour-long class every other day, why not alternate and do both (step on Monday, spin on Wednesday, step on Friday...)

You attempt to remove inner incompletion through indulgence. You feel different sensations would give you completion. But the greed for sensations increases incompletion. The desire for more makes you want more rather than feel complete.     During sleep there is no wanting, as you are complete. This does not mean condemning your sense organs. Keep them alive and pure. Sensations are fine as long as you do not get addicted to them. An addiction happens in ignorance.     How should I relax?   Learn the art of balancing life. Do not put all your eggs into one basket. Learn to open your body centre through exercise, yoga, deep breathing... learn to open your mind. There is joy when you learn and when you keep your mind open to new possibilities. Learn to open up your bliss centre.     A prince met Lord Buddha whose presence and being inspired him to be a monk. The prince was a great musician and led a luxurious life. After initiation, he went to the other extreme. He renounced everything. He started fasting vigorously and walked on thorns.Buddha inquired, If the strands of the guitar are very loose, can you play good music? No, replied the prince. If the strands of the guitar are very tight, can you still play good music? No, replied the prince.     Dont go to extremes, it is only through right tuning of the strands that you can play good music. Similarly, balance your life well and automatically music would flow into your life, advised Lord Buddha.     What steps should I take in order to relax? >>   What steps should I take in order to relax?   Mostly, tensions emerge from the way your mind transcribes your experience. For example, a student might enjoy running but when it is made a punishment, running creates tension. The stronger the waves, the more a surfer enjoys it. He is totally present in the moment. There are no interfering thoughts in him. In such space something in him makes him very alive to the life around him.     Be in the present, it is joyful. Live from the higher self, not from the lower self. The higher self encourages you, as it is filled with positiveness. The lower self is an interfering self. It discourages you. It acts more like an obstacle.     Relax your body and mind. When thoughts emerge, see them as a wonder. See the beauty of your thoughts. Do not fight with them. See them like a play. Slowly, you create a synergy with your thoughts. But whenever possible, be without thoughts. Learn the art of being empty. Do not verbalise an experience. Then your mind relaxes.     What is the difference between an ambitious and a meditative attitude ?   It is like darkness and light. Ambitions keep us in a whirlpool of tensions in the hope that we will be happy. They want us to be like others or better than others and in the process you become bitter.     Meditation awakens your awareness. Once your awareness is of a high order, you realise the foolishness of comparison. You would not allow others success to define your failure. You would see the beauty of what is and not get lost in 'what should be'.     Everyone is unique. Everyone is incomparable. You would learn the art of seeing beauty even in imperfection. You would participate in the miracle of life than being busy in judging life. You would listen to the mantra of life or the song of life. Your listening would be with your heart. You will hear music. With this, your perception awakens to newer heights.       Managing Stress    Swami Sukhabodhananda  RSS Feeds| SMS ASTRO to 8888 for latest updates       One youngster comes to me very depressed and asks this question "Why is God creating so many difficulties for us? How to handle stress?" I tell this youngster to reflect on this beautiful story:     A man goes to a shop, picks up a beautiful cup and says "my god this cup is so beautiful" and suddenly the cup starts talking to the man. The cup starts saying "O man, I am beautiful right now, but what was the state of my being before the pot-maker made me a beautiful pot?     Before I was sheer mud and the pot-maker pulled me out of the mud from the mother earth and I felt why that pot-maker is so cruel, he has separated me from mother earth. I felt a tremendous pain. And the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me and churned me, when I was churned I felt so giddy, so painful, so stressful, I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me into a oven and heated me up, I felt completely burnt. There was tremendous pain and I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait."     Then he poured hot paint on me and I felt the fume and the pain, I again asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then again he put me into an oven and heated it to make me more strong, I felt life is so painful hence pleaded the pot-maker and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." And after that the pot-maker took me to the mirror and said, "Now look at yourself". And surprisingly I found myself so beautiful.     When god gives us lot of trouble, it appears god is very cruel but we need patience and we have to wait. When bad things happen to good people, they become better and not bitter.     So all difficulties are part of a cosmic design to make us really beautiful. We need patience, we need understanding, we need the commitment to go through in a very calm and wise way. So all difficulties are not to tumble us but to humble us.     With this understanding, let us not be against difficulty. Understand difficulty is a part of a purifying process. A purifying process at present which we cannot understand and hence we need faith and we need trust.     Let us

6ca4b6f47d2c226b88b9297463881c79aa	in my whole career so far i m hearing abt this syndrome(candida syn.)for the 1st time.............i dont think there is anything like it.....just calm urself down:)be happy and keep smiling as if there is anything like this then this is the only treatment;)|`|5e014ffa73ef50e252f66399d55aec20aa	i found alot of cures but no one really saying what it is   P.S.  one site calls it a yeast infection:   it's an allergy ???and is not supported by orthodox medicine    Candida albicans is a yeast-like fungus which inhabits almost all humans. It lives on the moist dark mucous membranes which line the mouth, vagina and intestinal tract. Ordinarily it exists only in small colonies, prevented from growing too rapidly by the human host's immune system, and by competition from other microorganisms in and on the body's mucous membranes. When something  happens to upset this delicate natural balance, candida can grow rapidly and aggressively, causing many unpleasant symptoms to the host. Some of the symptoms are widely known and acknowledged. Vaginal yeast infections, primarily caused by candida, present the most common case in point. Thrush, the white yeast infection of the mouth and tongue which is common in infants,  is another well-known example of candida overgrowth.     well if the anti-depressant didn't work another should have been prescribed..did you tell your doctor they weren't working ? ....and always ask if they have samples of this drug you can try first, before getting the prescription filled...some times it takes trying several different ones till one works right..i know from experience.....  and i bet alot of this is stress related.....you have lost ,in your mind ,everything you ever knew and the mind is very powerful ...  but nowadays with internet you can still keep in contact with loved ones thousands of miles away...you can even see and hear them everyday if you want for free over the internet....    it's hard being ripped away from loved ones, i know i live near no family, but you just need to get out there make friends, participate in your community....go help the elderly or children at the schools. if you are religious get involved with things through your church...  Take Care...LIVE LIFE ONE DAY AT A TIME and try to laugh everyday|`|cef4dff290498c2218f0f800a6e5b415aa	To answer your question, the candida system has no basis in science.  With no scientific basis, it's a lie.  Treatment for it will make you feel no better than placebo.  So, that tree is not worth barking up.    Your depression, on the other hand, is serious and not a lie.  I'm glad you're seeing people for it, but I wouldn't necessarily skip from one psychiatrist to the next.  Stick with one psychiatrist or change to a psychologist.  If anti-depressants don't help, you can try talk therapy, which is actually better than anti-depressants, or shock therapy, which works well for treatment-resistant depression.    As far as your reactions to different types of food, you'd have to state what that reaction is.  More depressed?  Bad gas?  Diarrhea?  Nausea/Vomiting?|`|AA10324123	Good morning,    To thoroughly answer your question, I must cover quite a bit of ground.  As such, this answer will be a bit long.  Please bear with me.      At the end of my answer I have provided several links to URL's that discuss different aspects of the link between diet & depression.  It is my hope that these few links may lead you down the road to discovery, which will hopefully allow you to your return to your optimal mental & physical health.      Yes, Candidiasis is real!  And yes, there are direct links between depression and nutritional deficiencies!  Further, nutritional deficiencies can occur because of poor intestinal health.  Please read on for further details.    Allopathic medicine (i.e. Western medicine or A.M.A. medicine) has traditionally been painfully slow to recognize the links between diet and dis-ease.       Just like an engine needs quality fuel to run optimally, so do our bodies & particularly our brains.  Certain nutrients are vital to correct brain functions.  Rob the brain of the vital nutrients and the synapses won't fire.    Having said that, I will also point out that virtually all nutritional absorption occurs in the intestinal lining.  And, the cilia of the intestinal walls can develop build up, which inhibits or prevents proper nutritional absorption, much in the same way that food particulate builds up on your teeth if it isn't brushed away. If the 'gunk' stays on your teeth too long, it begins to putrify, causing damage and eventual tooth decay.        Insufficient fiber, hydration, and exercise (to stimulate peristalsis) can impede proper elimination, thereby resulting in build-up on the intestinal cilia.  If the cilia has a build-up or blockage, this represents the optimal environment (i.e. warm moist, protected) for pathogens to feed and multiply.  By pathogens, I mean bacteria and parasites, including Candida Albicans.     What makes Candida Albicans particularly problematic is that this fungus type parasite can, if left unchecked, create lesions in the intestinal lining.  The candida anchors itself as it feeds & multiplies, resulting in the lesions.  The tiny lesions can become small tears or holes in the lining, thereby allowing undigested food particulate & toxins to re-enter the body (Leaky Gut Syndrome), and travel unimpeded to virtually any part of the body.  One's natural immune system will fight the foreign matter, causing immuno reaction.  So now, not only is the absorption of certain nutrients being hampered by cilial build-up, and parasitic anchoring, but the body also finds itself in a constant state of immuno reaction, leaving the body drained and ill-equipped to handle other immuno challenges.    The above referenced lesions, and resulting tears can also occur if one consumes foods that he or she is allergic to.  For example:  protein allergies; gluten and dairy proteins.  If one is allergic to the proteins contained in these foods, then the immune system begins it's fight inside the intestines.  Long-term exposure to allergens can result in permanent damage to the cilia, and intestinal lining.  Incidentally, many persons of Northern European descent have a genetic pre-dispostion to gluten allergies, where once the damage to the cilia is quantifiable by medical testing is known as Celiac Disease.     Candida Albicans is present in every body, to some degree.  And, is not problematic if kept in check by: proper/complete elimination, and consumption of the necessary components to prevent colonization of the Candida, which includes lactic flora or pro-biotics (acidophilis, bifidus, bulgaircus, etc...).      So, now to your specifics:  You indicated that you had bowel issues, and several of the symptoms of Candidiasis: spaciness, depression, immuno challenges, and finally reactions to foods.  These are classic symptoms of Candidiasis, by the way.      You indicated that you took Threelac.  For how long?   And, did you also make the necessary dietary changes, including bombardment with high quality pro-biotics?      I have not taken Three-Lac personally, though I know many other who have.  I found it to be far too expensive, and aggressive.  The candida die-off is very rapid with Three-lac.  Candida die-off symptoms can make you feel worse than you did before beginning the erradication process.  The reason for this is: as the Candida are erradicated, their cellular structure dies, releasing toxins, and leaving mass which must be processed through the elimination process.  Remember that candida anchors itself to the cilia, and burrows itself to the intesinal lining in more severe cases.  So, the dead and dying pathogens are attached to the intestine, releasing toxins.  And, elimination of them difficult.  Think of how difficult it can be to remove a cactus needle or a splinter.  Incidentally, this toxin release is also going on continuously as the candida colonizes.  They are parasites.  So, they are eating your nutrition before you can absorb it.  And, when something eats, it must eliminate.      I have successfully used, and recommend "ParaGone II" for parasitic erradication.  It is manufactured by Renew Life Formulas, out of Clearwater, Fl.  And, is available in many health food stores.  I like this product because it is not too expensive, and works a bit more slowly, to limit the symptoms of Candida Die-Off.      However, if you wish to recieve long-term relief from the symptoms of Candidiaisis, you will need to make a commitment to:  limiting the foods that candida uses to colonize (i.e. sugars & particularly refined carbs), supplementing with quality pro-biotics, eating healthy, and including, at least some, regular exercise.    As for the depression:  Perhaps it is an underlying symptom of the Candidiasis.  Or perhaps, it is the result of long-term insufficient supplies of the necessary nutrients.  In eit

bf22bebea9c61dd723eaa74047da06b1aa	Most condoms made by major manufacturers are good quality, and breakage/leakage rates are carefully monitored in manufacturing.  The latex CAN degrade by age---which is why they have expiration dates---and excessive heat/temperatures can also ruin the rubber, which is why keeping them in the glove compartment of your car is a Real Bad Idea.      From what I understand, the fastest way known to ruin a condom is to use a non-compatible lubricant with it.  If you use anything with a petroleum base, like Vaseline, it will literally MELT.      Also, I checked a general reference (Guide to Getting it On, by Paul Joannides, 4th edition; Goofy Foot Press---probably the best, and certainly funniest, general sexuality book)---he mentioned a researcher (p. 578: Paul Voeller; no other citation listed) found that hand creams of ALL types and body powders will seriously weaken and destroy condoms.  "Almost any type of hand cream will weaken a latex rubber by 90% in less than 60 seconds, especially those that contain mineral oil."      Moral of the story:  USE ONLY lubricants that are marked as LATEX-COMPATIBLE.    There's also a reference that condoms may burst if you don't squeeze the air out of the tip before rolling it into place down the penile shaft.  I've only had one condom break during intercourse (very horrifying experience; thank goodness for the morning-after pill!)---no idea why it broke, BUT if I was having prolonged intercourse, I'd pause and check to make sure the rubber was still intact.    I've heard that condom failure rates are based upon use for conventional vaginal intercourse, and there are anecdotal stories that **they may be slightly more likely to break** during anal intercourse, but have no hard data concerning this.  (You're on your own for the chances in general; maybe check the Planned Parenthood site?)    From what I understand, most "contraceptive failures" on condom usage are associated not with breakage, but with failing to put the thing on early enough (before ANY penetration occurs), or with not hanging onto it during withdrawal, and the condom slipping off.      In summary:  Buy nationally-known brands; check expiration dates; keep them at room temperature; use only LATEX-COMPATABLE lubricants; check the condom if you're having prolonged or really energetic sex.  And always use a fresh new condom, each time, every time, whenever you're having penetrative intercourse, to reduce the chances of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.    Hope this helps.|`|a5896403bb300ff149c54fa0caa72e6eaa	A condom could break if there is not enough lubrication or if the condom is latex and you use vaseline as a lubricant it could break.

In these three situations, your chances are high if you don't follow the "rules".  To be more safe, try lambskin condoms.  They are more expensive, but worth the extra for safety and pregnancy prevention.|`|1303b5dd4ca633e7664ee837f0fd6ad8aa	When you put them on wrong or use them pass their expiration date.

In worse cases, you can also have trouble swallowing, problems with gagging, and sleep apnea.    Currently the only treatment is surgery to increase the opening in the skull that is compressing the nerves in the brain. Different neurosurgeons have various different techniques for doing this, and results vary quite a bit, but it may improve symptoms of the compression.

Prolonged deficiency results in drying of the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that lines the inner surface of the eyelids and extends over the forepart of the eyeball). With continued vitamin A deficiency, the drying extends to the cornea (xerophthalamia). The cornea eventually shrivels up and becomes ulcerated (keratinomalacia). Superficial, foamy gray triangular spots may appear in the white of the eye (Bitot's spots).

Original Article:http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/erectil...      Erectile dysfunction  Introduction  Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects the lives of many middle-aged men and their partners to one degree or another. The term erectile dysfunction covers a range of disorders, but usually refers to the inability to obtain an adequate erection for satisfactory sexual activity.  Although erectile dysfunction, formerly called impotence, is more common in men older than 65, it can occur at any age. An occasional episode of erectile dysfunction happens to most men and is normal. As men age, it's also normal to experience changes in erectile function. Erections may take longer to develop, may not be as rigid or may require more direct stimulation to be achieved. Men may also notice that orgasms are less intense, the volume of ejaculate is reduced and recovery time increases between erections.  When erectile dysfunction proves to be a pattern or a persistent problem, it can interfere with a man's self-image as well as his and his partner's sexual life. Erectile dysfunction may also be a sign of a physical or emotional problem that requires treatment.  Erectile dysfunction was once a taboo subject, but more men are seeking help. Doctors are gaining a better understanding of what causes erectile dysfunction and are finding new and better treatments.

If I were you, I'd put him up for some difficult physical activity that keeps him busy and teaches him stuff too.    It's good that you have pets. But more than kittens, your son should have a big dog, that cannot be easily taken for granted. When he sees that even others can "accidentally" hurt him, he'll learn to show some empathy. A little show of strength from you too can teach him a lesson in taking others in consideration.    yes, you can go the easy way, drug him. Never talk to him, treat him like a diseased patient who can get away with anything because "it's a chemical imbalance in his head" etc. You can do all that and give him an excuse to never improve on the pretext of having a disease. Or you can work to make your kid all that he is capable of doing and being the man he deserves to be and the kid you wanted to have. But it requires hard work, on your part and his and there is no such thing as free lunch.     If you keep giving excuses for his bad behavior, he'll learn to pretend that it's all because of a disease. And please don't tell me that it's a mental illness and can't be cured; people can heal of cancer if they put their minds to it. Yes, look it up.

Make sure you speak very clearly.     If you don't know what the person needs or wants, simply ask him/her.     If you give directions to a person with a cognitive disability, try to make them easy and clear. Use shorter instructions and simple, direct sentences.      Help the person remember directions by providing picture clues or other visual images.     If the person has trouble understanding you, repeat the information using different wording. You may also suggest that the person take notes to help himself/herself remember.     If you don't understand the person, don't pretend that you do. Ask him/her to repeat what they said.     Rehearse, role-play, or model important information with the person.     Use gestures or diagrams to explain things.     When you are sharing information, speak slowly and give the person time to think the information over before continuing.     Make things as concrete (less abstract) as you can.       Don't use humor that the person may not understand.  If you do use humor, and the person doesn't laugh, don't think the person's rude.  They just didn't understand the joke.     Don't expect everyone to be a good reader.  Some people might not read at all.      When you are traveling with a person with a cognitive disability, add cues like, "We'll be leaving for Madison, Wisconsin in half an hour".

She may also have some mental hangups or ways of relating or dealing with things that may be helped by therapy but not be a diagnosable "mental disorder"      I would tell her that you love her very much and you are worried about her....you are concerned about what ever....try to get her to talk about it or ask her opinion about how she views it.  These behaviors may seem normal to her or she may have an idea that there is something wrong.  Tell her that you are there for her and will support her if she wants to get help for it or just go see someone and talk to a professional to get their advice.  talking to a therapist doesn't mean there is something wrong with you.  Unfortunately seeking mental help is sometimes like recovering from addiction or many other similar things.  it may not work unless she makes the decision for herself that she needs help with this.  if she is going to see someone to make you happy she may not be completely honest or may resent going.    i would let you know you love her and it is only concern and not judgment.  let her know you are there for her and if there is something wrong you will support her thought it.  the rest is up to her|`|AA10758710	your concern and care for her justifys ur means and so u should bring it up and discuss it and if it is the ur speculations are tru help her to help herel ie get help.|`|31be09486f02a372471f34e8ccb07584aa	Honesty is very important in a relationship--so is communication.

If you want to experience one, you just need to masturbate. Sometime when your all alone, take off your pants, and panties, lie down on your bed and begin to gently rub your vagina, and the are around it. Pretty soon you will get aroused and starting get wet, this is normal, so don't worry about it. The more you rub, the wetter you will get. When you have an orgasm you will know it. You will want to scream with pleasure, that is why it's best if your all alone, then you don't have to worry about making a lot noise. I orgasm much better if I don't have to be quite.    After you've done this a few times, experiment a little bit with your rubbing, You may want to start inserting your finger in to your vagina, this feels really, really, really good. You can also find so objects that you can use instead of your finger. Just make sure that they are clean, and that they won't break. Also make sure that they don't get lost or stuck inside you. Then you would have to explain to your mom what you were doing, and go to the hospital to have it removed.

Eat high friber foods like bread that has a minimum of 3 grams of fiber per slice. Eat fruits specially apples. Eat lean meats and vegetables. Forget about the scale for 6 months. Only weigh yourself if u think you are gaining weight. Also remember that white bread and rice are a no no. Do this for next few months and let me know how you are doing through yahoo answers.

AA10639053	You question is kind of confusing...1st of all to tone your abs you need to do tons of crunches/sit ups, v kicks (laying on the floor w/ feet directly in front of you pull your legs up into a V and at the same time pull your upper body up as you would a sit up and DO NOT let your legs touch the floor do that a/b 25 to 50 x's a night and you will be on your way to a successful abodomin! And as you are pulling up w/ these stretches/excersises exhale so you don't form a pooch in your lower belly!!
AA10639053	Like I had told a previous girl, you NEED to eat healthy. If you eat a lot then eat multiple small meals throughout the day (I know that's harder if you are still in school) rather than 3 large meals of junk and fatty stuff! If you have a member ship at a gym go to the gym and run the tredmill, do crunches, (check the web for body toning excersises) etc. OR you can even do little workouts at home. Granted it is more expensive to be healthy than it is to be overweight, it's worth it! But as you are working out you are building muscle and eliminating fat! That's what you want b/c muscle weighs more than fat anyhow and looks soo much better! Good luck on the weight gain/loss!|`|AA10006792	The best way to maintain your weight and  enjoy your food. You   should make it a life time  commitment. You can eat what ever     you like as long as you are eating a small portion and walk at least 30 to 45 minutes a day every other day. In alternate date lift weights and do a simple aerobic exercise which you enjoy like dancing or brisk walking . Stop worrying about your weight that will cause you to get depressed. I suggest to consult  your Dr and dietitian who can tailor a proper diet for you. Stay away from pork and beef. If you can not stay away from eating fatty food just do it once in a while. If you can eat a hand full of almonds or walnut( only a hand full a day no more or less) you get the good fat.  Make sure you resolve the issues that bother you and make you lose weight, you should seek some counseling. Swimming,  cycling are good exercises. The best life time exercise you can do at any age is walking and you can incorporate it with your daily routine.

This other person will experience the very same rejection from someone else, that is a guarantee!  Personally, I feel that this person valued you enough to tell you straight from their heart.  So many people we admire take advantage of our vulnerability and use us.  Now imagine the fallout from being left after being used!  This person has honorable intentions.  Your choices are evident.  Either abide by this person's commital of friendship, or make YOUR CHOICE to abandon them due to the fact that, "it just makes you feel better."   That is something YOU have complete control over.  YOURSELF and NO ONE should Ever take a front seat over your very precious emotional feelings.  Fix yourself by realizing there are too many others and so little time.  Get busy.  You will also be much more attractive by staying busy.  YOU do have a life of your own.  YOU work people in when you want to! Do not give up the power of you to anyone!

Everybody has periods where they feel low, or down. These are normal emotions, and appropriate after bad news, bereavement and so forth.   However, depression  the illness, is persistent, and help is required to recover. The difference with depression is when the unhappiness is without cause, or lasts much longer and is out of proportion to circumstances, or seems beyond the sufferers personal control to manage.    Depression affects people differently.  Some are mildly affected  often known as dysthymia,  and manage to function despite their condition.  Others may be severely depressed and find it very difficult to carry out even the most basic tasks., such as washing and dressing.    There are also different types of depression, such as the episodes of depression, followed by elation in manic depression  (bipolar affective disorder, SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and PND (post natal depression).    Spike Milligan and Winston Churchill were two famous manic depressives.  Depression is not selective of class, status or upbringing.    SYMPTOMS    Symptoms are many, varied and not all sufferers will exhibit the same problems. They may include:    Continual low mood  Feeling of inadequacy  Feeling tearful and emotional  Irritability  Anger / aggression  Anxiety  Lack of motivation  Lack of social interest  Poor personal care  Irrational / guilty thoughts  Feeling of hopelessness  Suicidal thoughts  Tired all the time  Loss of appetite / weight  Comfort eating  Inability to sleep  Disturbed sleep  Loss of concentration  Sleeping too much / not waking refreshed  Loss of libido  Avoiding people / social situations  Lack of energy  Feeling physically ill  Extreme lethargy  Bleak and pessimistic view of the future    N.B. Anxiety and depression are closely linked. Anxiety can cause depression, and depression can cause anxiety.        SO WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS?    Depression is a complex illness, and can occur for several reasons.    In a person suffering from depression, levels of neuro-transmitters are lowered. One of these is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5HT).    It can be triggered as a result of a number of causes:    Social Circumstances  Unemployment, divorce or break down of relationship, bereavement, redundancy, sudden/dramatic change to personal circumstances    Physical Conditions    Glandular fever, influenza, anaemia, diseases such as multiple sclerosis, severe arthritis,  and treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy    Hormonal Changes  Pregnancy, resulting in PND  about 10% of all women experience significant PND.  Depression presents more commonly in women (this may also be because men are more reluctant to visit their doctor)    Psychological Conditions  Sufferers of anxiety may also find they develop depression. Unresolved psychological issues also contribute. About 60% of people suffering chronically with anxiety and panic will also develop associated depression.    Drug and Alcohol Abuse    WHAT TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE?    Each sufferer is an individual, and treatments vary.  Many people combine treatments for optimum effect, i.e. medication and counselling. The preferred choice at present is SSRIs along with CBT. The medication is to lift the mood enough to be able to take on board and learn skills needed to overcome the condition long term.    The first step is to visit your GP. They can confirm your diagnosis and ensure your depression does not have a physical cause.  You must be prepared to be honest with yourself and your GP. If you have some unresolved issues, medication alone will not provide a cure, and your GP can recommend you for  some form of therapy.    Therapy  This may include Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or counselling.  All health authorities have a Community Mental Health Team, who will be able to select and provide appropriate treatment upon your referral by your GP. If you really feel you need it, do not be afraid to request a referral.   Medication  There are several different types of anti-depressants. You are likely to be offered one of the following types:    SSRI  (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), the most known household brand name being Prozac (fluoxetine) but now include a whole stable of closely related medicines   Tricyclic antidepressants   MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)   Moclobemide   Different people respond better to different drugs, and different categories of depression respond better to different drugs to, so there may be a degree of trial and error before you find the right one for you.  There is no universal wonder drug, and what worked for your friend may not be beneficial to you.    Before you go to your GP, you may like to make a list of lifestyle considerations to discuss the most suitable medication.  For example, if you lead a busy life, or drive for a living, a drug which makes you drowsy may not suit, where if you have problems sleeping at night it may be beneficial.    There are several sites on the internet which explain in detail each type of medication, and their possible side effects.    Anti-depressants are not addictive. However, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly. Any withdrawal should be gradual and under medical supervision.    Alternative Medicine  St Johns Wort is a herbal remedy, which has a similar effect to SSRIs and is commonly used in the treatment of depression. Do research this carefully before starting yourself on this. It can be very effective|`|de6567b62b84e0dadb518bee868dab36aa	forget about it/just forget about him /he would only do harm to u|`|50ed9bc1f09e9bf21aeb1e69570175b8aa	try to wish good positive things for this person and soon they will start to come to you  be sincere|`|e4d6df4ab773a8e142caf742211772b2aa	This is a very good blog, a beginners guide to abnormal psychology.

751ac226ee8964ee39f00b34d1a423b9aa	Maybe it's what some people refer to as your "calling".  Would I be right at guessing that you are also bright, articulate, creative, and insightful?      Maybe you're a budding artist or a future novelist?  A lot of people who are gifted in this area can easily tune into other people and display a deep sense of empathy and compassion for other living things.  Maybe try to find a creative outlet like writing or acting.  Perhaps you could volunteer for a good cause.  Rather than seeing a therapist, maybe you could become one.    Carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders is a tough gig for one person.  As hard is it may be, try to accept that there are some things in this world that you cannot help or change....That's life.  You'd be amazed though at how many lives you touch and change without even realizing you're doing it.... That's beautiful :-)    Good luck to you!|`|AA12346961	This is from the HitchHiker's Guide -- my favourite book by the way -- I quote from it all the time ;)    (paraphrase)    There was once a girl who had a picture with her. It had all sorts of cute little cuddly animals dressed in jackets and stuff and all of them were in a boat. There were atleast nine or ten of them in the boat. The boat was attached to a rope in the front that was tied to an otter who was swimming before the boat.     The little girl worried how was such a little otter to pull the boat and all the animals in it, I mean he'd be very tired now, wouldn't he?    She wondered and wondered and then one day she saw that there was a sail at the back -- the wind was working the boat -- the otter was alright. He didn't have to pull the big heavy boat -- he was just having some fun in the water.    (End of story)    Take care of yourself. The world is big enough to take care of itself. it's all alright -- that "boat" has a sail attached to it. It will go on it's own.    The otter (aka you) should stop worrying and have some serious fun. When we are happy, we unconciously spread it around and make the world better on its own.    Stop worrying. Start living.|`|5925c58172b12347becc3bc7e265bfb2aa	id say its pretty normal, but im not any kind of doctor. im sensitive and emotional too, but not to that extent. who says you cant do anything about some of these things? volunteer at places like the salvation army, or united way. u know that saying "to the world you may only be one person, but to one person you may be the world"? well if u can only help one person, then at least you helped one...there are a lot of people out there that just dont care what happens to other people and animals.      but dont let yourself stress over these things.|`|0ef8f4f37ce110adf60194336b7885eaaa	It's a good thing to be sensitive but you also want to be able to separate from it.  I am guessing that age will take care of that better than anything else.     As a child, we stopped eating veal because I saw a documentary on how it came to us.  As an adult, I still care about the homeless, the helpless, the sick, the starving.  But I am able to keep it in perspective and not have it overwhelm me at night.  I realize that if I do my small part, that is doing plenty.|`|71f591c3a3f4cf9378ed45df912872e7aa	It's not normal.  In fact, I think the compassion and sensitivity that you have is quite rare unfortunately.  I sure wish your attitude was more normal, because then the world would be a better place.  I also look out in the rain and save bugs from drowning in swimming pools and all that stuff.  I know it's really hard going through life with being so sensitive to other peoples pain, but feel lucky to have that sensitivity, because you make the world a better place to live and bless other peoples lives, and animals lives as well, with this gift/curse.  You're a very special, compassionate young lady.

I think it's wonderful your such a warm and caring person!!  Has your parents or other loving adults voiced any concerns about your feelings or that you worry to much? Just try and keep things in perspective and don't get upset over things you can't change..Try to get out there and help people within your reach..Do you know any elderly people that don't have family around?  The elderly have a need for many things and usually the biggest is human companionship..there is so much they can teach you about life, and in return you can give them a few hours of feeling cared about and not forgotten..If you don't know of any contact a local nursing home and tell them what your interested in doing..I'll bet they will welcome you with open arms!   This world can depress even the happiest person..Try not to watch the news to much..Believe it or not a-lot of the things the media talks about have been going on for years it's just we have better technology and in turn hear about things that years ago we never would of!  Please take care and think happy thoughts when you go to sleep at night..Your only 15 and believe me you'll have plenty of time to try and save the world when your older(I will need some help with it by then!)LOL  You are what my Granny would call an old soul!  And that is a blessing!|`|AA12227191	I think you are a very caring and considerate person. But you have to be grateful and thankful for what you have been given and not feel guilty for others not as fortunate. When you can help someone with some change or volunteer. One day you might make a huge difference. But like me you must learn you can't take all the homeless home. You can't feed all the hungry. But you can buy an extra sandwich when you eat out and give it to someone homeless. There are a lot of places in this world where one young girl can make a difference. This may be one of them. Some adult who can help may read this  and take some action. Congratulations! You are a wonderful person. Before you go to sleep say a prayer to God to care for them, He can you can't. But prayer and speaking out does help.

Your body needs the nourishment to have a period. One way to predict your period however, take BC pills, that way you can always plan around it.

The original ointment contains three different antibiotics: bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin B. Other brand names for this mixture include Mycitracin and Topisporin.  Neomycin and polymyxin are effective in killing gram-negative bacteria, while bacitracin targets gram-positive bacteria; hence, this 'triple antibiotic' ointment covers for a wide range of bacteria which may infect wounds.

73d5ba18994a20c60c9c3499c1bbf233aa	Douche is a French word meaning "shower".  Doucher is the French verb: "to shower".    The word was taken by the feminine products industry to explain the process of cleaning the vagina with an enema-like system, when one felt "not so fresh" (ie., when a woman didn't like the natural smells of her genital area).    It now is very much so out of favor because the beneficial bacteria in the vagina is removed and opportunistic infections can get in. Along with the irritant deodorant sprays (they now tell you to spray it on undergarments instead of directly on the area), douching just isn't done any more because of the health risks associated with female genital deodorants (aka. "feminine products").    Currrently, the best suggestion is to clean the area thoroughly (but not inside the vagina!) with soap or shampoo, and water.  If there are still unpleasant or sour odors, a woman needs to contact a physician to see if she has an infection or STD.    I hope this explained it completely to you!  :-)|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	Woman  will douche if they are expecting to recieve oral sex.

Last year I did go to a chiropractor who did do an x-ray and it turns out one of my hips was setting higher than the other due to some vertebrae being misaligned.  I recommend you get an x-ray.  Most chiro's will do the first one for free to try to earn your biz.|`|3f037ba3611f54cbfcf0a2239dba58f1aa	Chiro will put your hip back in the right angle so this will not happen and you will not have a numb leg during and after lying on it. I have a strange hip too and when this occurs I go see my chiro and he makes it better. Sometimes I do not have to see him till months later.|`|AA11156094	visit your local chiropractor(after researching), and your "click" will disappear. you should not need an xray for this small problem......i had the same "click" at age 17. my hip was slightly dislocated from athletics.......its a memory now.....good luck!!!

Martial arts can help you with most of the problems you just listed and I can explain exactly why:    Stress' in school: You can relieve alot of your stress in the dojo on the punching bags. You will also eventually learn how to not entertain stressful ideas, if you are persistent.    Teasings: A bully will not continue to pick on you if he has an excellent reason not to. The development of your martial arts technique will give a bully a reason to stop picking on you.    Community issues: A good school will teach you how to interact with others on a number of different levels, which will make you feel more connected to your community.    Emotions and destructiveness: You can learn how to bring forward these upsetting emotions that give you extremely intense feelings that make you want to destroy something. Bring forward these emotions in the dojo, and learn how to honestly express yourself completely and destructively on a punching bag or a sparring partner. Your negative emotions will eventually deplete.    Feeling real tensed up all the time is obviously rooted in the fact that you are uncomfortable with yourself or your environment(or those who are in your environment). You need to learn how to relax your mind and the body because when your muscles are contracted like this, you are constantly wasting energy. You may also have trapped, very instense energy that you need to get rid of.    Profuse sweating is probably linked with nervousness.     Ultimately what you need to start doing more often is exercising daily. Start tommorrow.|`|AA12346961	Stop being a hypochondriac and learn to laugh at your problems.    In two-thousand years, it won't matter if the community was supportive or not or the people teased you or not.    What would matter would be if you had a good time being alive. Are you happy throwing tantrums? If not, just give it up.    Every time you feel like telling someone off or screaming, just say instead "Ahhh! It's just not worth the effort. Nothing's gonna change anyway."     Yep. Life is unfair. But you don't have to notice it all that much, do you now? If people don't care about your feelings, you shouldn't waste time trying to get them to notice that you are hurt either. It won't work. Give it up. Instead, do something that makes you happy. You only got this life -- live it in a healthy, happy way. I added the "healthy" bit because I don't want you to accidentally think of "addictions" and stuff. BTW a life well lived is an addiction by itself and the best one too. ;)|`|2f31b4d39ae1b04efdb601126bd63100aa	You might need antidepressents.  However, the best idea is to start going to a therapist.  They can help you find constructive ways to vent your anger.  Sometimes it just helps having someone to talk to like that.  If you cannot do that, then start keeping a journal.  In a journal you can say and do anything you want.  Write about what you would like to do...what you would like to say...everything!  It is a great way to vent and then regain composure without actually hurting anyone.  If you use a computer, then you can even delete it and then there is no record of you having your tantrum.  Also, we got my son a punching bag for him to vent his frustrations on.  It has worked wonders.  When he gets fed up, he just runs to his rooms, goes a few rounds and then he is fine.|`|AA11095838	you have a chemical imbalance. The brain is designed to control the release of chemicals to keep us sane. There are many drugs that aid in the release of chemicals that your brain is not releasing. I have seen countless individuals move from being depressed losers into happy, successful people. I highly suggest seeing a shrink. It's a hard thing to do at first but once you start, you will be a different person. A much happier, less aggressive and less emotional person.  Good luck.|`|084dc0ee3974f79d0f2d672bd695a1dbaa	You are going to have to learn to like yourself and quit worrying about what others think about you or your decisions. Everything that happened in your past cannot be changed so forget about the past and try not to let yourself dwell on bad things that happened to you. You become short tempered with people especially those you don't like because you don't want them to get the upper hand, when actually they get it every time you become angry. Smile at them instead and they will wonder if they are not the ones who are losing. It's not about being right always, make mistakes, fall down get back up and learn what made you fall in the first place. You need to go around people and talk to them, it seems to me you may not have learned to deal with people at a young age so now you have anxiety attacks from this situation. The only recourse you have is to quit being afraid and give it your all. You only live once and you are wasting time being afraid of the things that have no solidity to them. Those fears can be controlled, break each situation down as it comes and don't try to plan or preconceive every thing that is going to happen or be said.

You attempt to remove inner incompletion through indulgence. You feel different sensations would give you completion. But the greed for sensations increases incompletion. The desire for more makes you want more rather than feel complete.     During sleep there is no wanting, as you are complete. This does not mean condemning your sense organs. Keep them alive and pure. Sensations are fine as long as you do not get addicted to them. An addiction happens in ignorance.     How should I relax?   Learn the art of balancing life. Do not put all your eggs into one basket. Learn to open your body centre through exercise, yoga, deep breathing... learn to open your mind. There is joy when you learn and when you keep your mind open to new possibilities. Learn to open up your bliss centre.     A prince met Lord Buddha whose presence and being inspired him to be a monk. The prince was a great musician and led a luxurious life. After initiation, he went to the other extreme. He renounced everything. He started fasting vigorously and walked on thorns.Buddha inquired, If the strands of the guitar are very loose, can you play good music? No, replied the prince. If the strands of the guitar are very tight, can you still play good music? No, replied the prince.     Dont go to extremes, it is only through right tuning of the strands that you can play good music. Similarly, balance your life well and automatically music would flow into your life, advised Lord Buddha.     What steps should I take in order to relax? >>   What steps should I take in order to relax?   Mostly, tensions emerge from the way your mind transcribes your experience. For example, a student might enjoy running but when it is made a punishment, running creates tension. The stronger the waves, the more a surfer enjoys it. He is totally present in the moment. There are no interfering thoughts in him. In such space something in him makes him very alive to the life around him.     Be in the present, it is joyful. Live from the higher self, not from the lower self. The higher self encourages you, as it is filled with positiveness. The lower self is an interfering self. It discourages you. It acts more like an obstacle.     Relax your body and mind. When thoughts emerge, see them as a wonder. See the beauty of your thoughts. Do not fight with them. See them like a play. Slowly, you create a synergy with your thoughts. But whenever possible, be without thoughts. Learn the art of being empty. Do not verbalise an experience. Then your mind relaxes.     What is the difference between an ambitious and a meditative attitude ?   It is like darkness and light. Ambitions keep us in a whirlpool of tensions in the hope that we will be happy. They want us to be like others or better than others and in the process you become bitter.     Meditation awakens your awareness. Once your awareness is of a high order, you realise the foolishness of comparison. You would not allow others success to define your failure. You would see the beauty of what is and not get lost in 'what should be'.     Everyone is unique. Everyone is incomparable. You would learn the art of seeing beauty even in imperfection. You would participate in the miracle of life than being busy in judging life. You would listen to the mantra of life or the song of life. Your listening would be with your heart. You will hear music. With this, your perception awakens to newer heights.       Managing Stress    Swami Sukhabodhananda  RSS Feeds| SMS ASTRO to 8888 for latest updates       One youngster comes to me very depressed and asks this question "Why is God creating so many difficulties for us? How to handle stress?" I tell this youngster to reflect on this beautiful story:     A man goes to a shop, picks up a beautiful cup and says "my god this cup is so beautiful" and suddenly the cup starts talking to the man. The cup starts saying "O man, I am beautiful right now, but what was the state of my being before the pot-maker made me a beautiful pot?     Before I was sheer mud and the pot-maker pulled me out of the mud from the mother earth and I felt why that pot-maker is so cruel, he has separated me from mother earth. I felt a tremendous pain. And the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me and churned me, when I was churned I felt so giddy, so painful, so stressful, I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me into a oven and heated me up, I felt completely burnt. There was tremendous pain and I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait."     Then he poured hot paint on me and I felt the fume and the pain, I again asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then again he put me into an oven and heated it to make me more strong, I felt life is so painful hence pleaded the pot-maker and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." And after that the pot-maker took me to the mirror and said, "Now look at yourself". And surprisingly I found myself so beautiful.     When god gives us lot of trouble, it appears god is very cruel but we need patience and we have to wait. When bad things happen to good people, they become better and not bitter.     So all difficulties are part of a cosmic design to make us really beautiful. We need patience, we need understanding, we need the commitment to go through in a very calm and wise way. So all difficulties are not to tumble us but to humble us.     With this understanding, let us not be against difficulty. Understand difficulty is a part of a purifying process. A purifying process at present which we cannot understand and hence we need faith and we need trust.     Let us|`|b30ebd51a705432ff85d083b2d05aea7aa	Try and go for a run before dinner,do your thing and try some Valerian herbal tea 1/2 hour before bed.
