Classiic does not reply and the new version of Yahoo will scan forever attachments. As a business I can not allow such down time.      What has happened to your site apart from drunken people who work for Yahoo and  I meet on flights they openly joke about the poor quality and the disruptions they creat for others.      Very poor and I shall change my mail address as there is nothing but disruptions with yahoo. Why can you not get it right, I was very happy with your service in the past.

20090304143420AA6IysZ	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Other - Yahoo! Messenger	How do I contact Sabrina Ellis, Yahoo Messenger Manager?	Sabrina Ellis is the manager at Yahoo who oversaw the migration of Yahoo Voice services to Jajah which was a complete clusterf*ck.        I would like her to know that my voice account was fine with Yahoo but once Jajah took over, it has never been inactive and I just lost my phone # which I am unable to get again.      While I am not aware that Yahoo is directly responsible for the failures of Jajah, they did have a fiduciary commitment to their customer base to ensure that the company taking over Yahoo Voice was competent and capable which is clearly not the case.      I have gathered lots of documentation demonstrating how miserably Jajah handled this transfer and would like to provide at least a summary to Sabrina Ellis or someone at Yahoo.      Can anyone provide me with her email address?

20090304134126AAnXuP6	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What prompts the deletion of my question?	I saw a question from somebody else that read: "Why does this section attract so many fascists and lunatics?" or something like that. I noticed it got deleted so quickly, I didn't have time to respond to it, so I think I've got that one figured out, but I've had a number of deletions that the administrator email described as a 'complaint' or something of that nature. Is that a response to a complaint from another user and if so, is that all it takes to delete a question? (Note: so far, every question deleted was restored after I contested it, so ultimately Y/A found the questions in question acceptable.)

20090304134234AAvlWS6	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	Please help!! 10 Points!! .......?	I work in Sales at a Cell Phone Company and we are trying to figure out a game to play on a dry erase board. (there are 5 of us) We played "Yellow Brick Road" where we got points and moved ahead and the one that made it to the end first wins. We also played "Chutes and Ladders" where we move ahead spaces and if there is a ladder you climb to get ahead if there is a chute you fall down and lose spots. Now we are on our 3rd month of playing and cant think of a game to play! I need a game where we can use our point system to move ahead and there is one winner at the end. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

20090227073803AA1TfLU	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What's the big deal with all the grammar and spellcheckers?	Everytime someone misspells a word or uses slightly bad grammar in a Q&A on Yahoo Answers; automatically receives a lecture. People saying things like "how do you expect us to take you seriously if you can't even spell properly"      It is not the point of the questions at all; especially if the question is not related to grammar and spelling. Most of the time you CAN understand what the person is saying and asking or answering; so what's the big deal here. You're not in school you are on a Q&A board on the internet.       To be honest it comes off as really obnoxious when people do it. I mean where not sitting a spelling test or even an english examination. Why can't you just answer the questions being asked to the best of you're understanding. And you have to acknowledge that since Yahoo is a global service you are going to be getting people from all over the world posting and answering questions and they have an issue with spelling certain words correctly; you have to take that into account.      What's your opinion!
