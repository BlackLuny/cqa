For tactics, get GM Kotov's how to think like a gm. to study opening theory, try to understand an opening's main ideas before memorizing lines (you don't need to memorize lines if you get the gist of an opening). also play the openings you want to learn a lot, preferably in skittles (non-rated games). also make sure you do a post mortem of EVERY game you play (w/ ur chessmaster). this last one really helped and still helps me steadily improve.|`|mxNH9tyCaa	the only mark against you is you had to ask, self doubt is you opponent in any game. don't check yourself before the game starts|`|AA10566329	sure you can

GUM10RYGaa	It is not a scam. They seem to be focusing on trying to make the games fairer, but it is a legitimate  as any other website. But i would wait while they add the new features, it seems there is some big changes coming and they will be then opening up to allow hundreds of players. Some people won some great items on launch, and they are doing a re launch soon, at the moment they are doing a few one of auction days. But they should be up and running in full force by the end of February.

Many people have taken a major in school and have a career that has nothing to do with it.  Do what you love.

43zXRpLYaa	Yes, it's true. I went on my birthday and got in for free. What they do is give you a ticket for either Disneyland or California Adventure, but not both. If you want to go to both you have to pay $25. If you live in Southern California they give you a 2-fer pass right now. So you can go to Disneyland on your birthday and then come back within 30 days and go to Disneyland again or California Adventure. If you're over 18 you need a picture ID, if you are younger than 18 you just need a birth certificate. If you sign up online and print out the paper with the barcode they email to you it will speed up the process at the ticket booth.<br>  <a href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyparks/en_US/WhatWillYouCelebrate/disneyland/index?name=CelebrationsDLRFreeOnYourBirthdayPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyp...</a><br>  <br>  Another cool thing is if you want to buy an annual pass, they will give you the value of the ticket off your annual pass. So you get in free, give them your ticket and they will give you $69 off your annual pass. Since I paid an extra $25 to go to both parks in one day. They took off $94 dollars. I got the Southern California pass and only pay like $6 a month.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	yes its true. its disney's promotion for 2009. <br>  here is where you need to sign up. it will tell you what you need to do. <br>  <a href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyparks/en_US/WhatWillYouCelebrate/index?name=WDWCelebrationsOverviewPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyp...</a><br>  <br>  and here is the FAQ section of the website to answer all your questions:<br>  <a href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyparks/en_US/WhatWillYouCelebrate/index?name=WDWCelebrationFAQsPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyp...</a>|`|ajnGHNr8aa	YES IT IS!!<br>  <br>    You get into any one theme park for free on the day of your birthday.

PQy6if0Waa	Act 5    Chapter - Train Wreck    28 - Once you get on the train, the first tag is inside the very first car you   enter.  As soon as the door opens, it will be on the floor to the left. This is  the same door jack had to rip while you fought the berzerker.    29 - You will then proceed through one passenger car and one car outside in   which a small battle takes place.  The very next car is a passenger car, the   tag is on the right before you exit the car.  If you exit the car without   picking the tag up, you will have to restart the chapter to get it because   the door locks behind you.    30 - The last tag is in the fourth car before the locomotive.    Locomotive > Lightmass Bomb > RAAM > Ammo Car > Tag.    You will press a button to have 4 fuel tanks jettisoned off the car and just   before you enter the ammo car, turn completely around and head straight back.  Once you enter the ammo car, the door will lock behind you and you will have  to restart the entire chapter from the front of the train if you miss it.

szR20p73aa	I play sims 2 on my vista and it works fine for me.   But I don't think there is anything you can do :(.   Such a sad sad sad loss, sims is one of gods greatest creation.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	I don't think so, but you could try to ask the techs at EA directly.  I am only saying I don't think so because I have seen so many questions here at Y!A where people were trying to get the older, original version of the sims (Just called The Sims) to run on a computer that has Vista, that it makes me assume that it is just too old of a game and simply won't work.    Sorry, I am sure this isn't the answer you were hoping for, but I can't lie to you and tell you it will work when I don't believe that it will.  :-(    **mishmish -- I think the person asking the question is talking about the old sims game, not the sims 2.  You are right about it if the person DOES mean the sims 2 though, it will play on Vista without any problems.  But the old, original game that was simply called The Sims won't.
YSmYkc5Yaa	Nope, just start it on the last level, and you have to do the entire final level.    I did it and I hated it personally. Haha.

And near the end when the floor starts collapsing on that final run to the end, everybody I played with kept dying. We must've replayed that part 100 times.    Here's a video that shows you where to start, and where the ghosts are.    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=3PQKOPjcPx...|`|e5RBM1xMaa	No You Have To Start On The Finale Level Named Halo And Have The Iron Skull On And The Game On Legendary And Do The Finale Like Escape Thing On The Four Ghosts That Are Under One Of The Ramps On The Right When Your On Your Way Out From Killing The Stupid Floating robot thing And Im Trying To Get This Achievment too But All My Friends Already Have It And Say Theyll Never Do It Again|`|83LBBuhZaa	no you have to complete a little chapter in a mission all on ghosts ( or whatever you have to drive )

If you don't have them already, try:  Call of Duty 4  Gears of War 2  Halo 3    GTA IV is pretty fun, but don't know if your parents would buy it for you.

FEAR 2: Project Origin (comes out next week)    Happy gaming and Happy Birthday!|`|KXl1t1QBaa	I would choose either Call of Duty 4 or Call of Duty:World at War......while World at War doesn't have the diversity of 4, I think it is more fun just simply because you need more skill to play.....plus: it has Nazi Zombies.    Halo 3 is fun, but can get boring quite quick.....Gears 2 is the same way.    Left 4 Dead is fun, but it is less fun once you beat it.    GTA IV isn't much of a challenge once you get used to playing the other games.    Happy Birthday/Gaming|`|Zb9ddY9oaa	CoD 4 is great not as good as CoD WaW  Gears of war 1&2 Halo 3 my favorite Saints Row 2. If ur a guy you should like those games.

Runescape isn't bad but WoW is better and worth the money.  Guild Wars is incredible value, the games can now be bought for 6.99 each, no online fees, the game+3 expansions at a similar price. There's only 20 levels and you level fast, there's lots of classes to choose from.|`|ZsK7vpOjaa	tales of pirates is also me and u lvl rely fast join im on sun set isles and ill help u lvl up and by the way Saturdays are the fast way to lvl 3x exp and Double drops lol hope u join my name is tigercloud NO spaces

IUQjiNRmaa	This is all the cool tricks:    Backflip = Sit + Jump  Breakdance = Lie on back + Spin  Handstand = Lie Down + Beg  Dance = Beg, and pull the paw upwards.  Sneeze = Click nose  Bunny hop = Dance + Jump  Turn Around = Beg + Spin  Half Flip=Roll over+ Jump  Ninja Jump = Lie on side + Beg  kick = When your dog is facing away from you, tap one of its hind legs  skratch = Grab one of your dog's ears while it's sitting, but don't pull on it!  ~ Special Trick ~    There is one special trick that is customizable, and that is sing. To perform sing, you must play a tune on your keyboard while your dog barks along. Make sure to zoom into the dog you want to learn it. After playing the song (with a maximum of 15 notes), wait for a second until the usual "Learn Trick" icon appears. Poke it and say the command. Do this a few times and you'll have a dog that can bark a tune on cue!    SING  Recommened Commands: (Various)  Appearance: Your dog sits down and barks a tune!  To Perform: See above paragraph.  Notes: It's difficult to perfect your tune, but this is easily the most  interesting trick in the game.    ?Hope this helps|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use.

M3T4bosnaa	Keeping it clean and letting it cool down are good ways to keep the red ring of death away. But sometimes that does not work, I bought a X Box 360 and two weeks after having it I got the RROD, when I sent it back to Microsoft they told me that it is an Internal problem, a bug, some X Boxes just malfunction. Nice huh, got it back and the new X Box they sent me less then 2 months later had to be sent back because of RROD. I only play 2 to 3 hours a day on the weekend. So I don't think overheating was it.

l6lh6fT8aa	The three main deck archetypes are Aggro, Control, and Combo. Aggro tries to beat up the opponent as quickly as possible, Control tries to gain control of the board and then finish the opponent off, and Combo tries to create a situation where the opponent loses automatically.<br>  <br>  The 5 colors each have certain strategies inherent in them as well.<br>  <br>  Red is dominated by Aggro decks. Though there are red-based combo decks, they are few and far between. Some control decks do splash red for removal, however.<br>  <br>  Green is mostly Aggro as well, but it has a decent showing in Control and Combo. Especially Combo, since green is the color of mana-fixing and combos often need tricky color requirements.<br>  <br>  White can go two ways. It's a decent Aggro color by itself, but it is also decent at Control. Combos are rarely seen in white.<br>  <br>  Blue is predominantly Control. Combo, too, is seen often in blue. Aggro is rarely, if ever, seen in blue.<br>  <br>  Black mostly prefers Control over Aggro, but it can do both. Combo appears often in black as well.<br>  <br>  A good theme deck...is really any of the 10th Edition ones - I find Molimo's Might especially good for new players, as it is fairly straightforward.|`|RFESIAsnaa	Well, it depends on what you want to play.<br>  <br>  How new are you to trading card games? If you've played Yu-Gi-Oh or others, you might be able to jump right into a block theme, but if you're totally new, i would suggest playing around with some friends who know the game.<br>  <br>  Here's a download from Wizards, it's a tutorial on how to play:<br>  <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/products/LearnToPlayMagic.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/magic/products/Le...</a><br>  <br>  Once you know the basics, you can start Deck Building<br>  <br>  When and if you want to jump into 'expert level' block decks, you'll want to get in on the most current cycle to ensure your cards are standard legal. The current cycle is called Shards of Alara, and it's on it's second block, called Conflux. The focus of Shards of Alara so far has been three color decks, and Conflux introduces five color decks.<br>  <br>  As a player with a deck for each Shard, i suggest Bant or Naya to new players, as you'll get out creatures and not have to focus much on your graveyard. Decks like Esper, Jund, and Grixis require a LOT of thinking and strategy based on whats all in your deck and in your graveyard. <br>  <br>  Bant's main mechanic is called "Exalted", which boosts up your creatures +1/+1 when they attack alone. This means if you had four 1/1 creatures all with Exalted, and you only attacked with one, that one would become a 5/5 until the end of your turn. <br>  <br>  Naya simply focuses on big creatures, usually 5 power or more. They cost a lot of mana, but you can get out your supporting creatures fast enough to make up for it. Naya is overall pretty simple, you just get benefits for having big creatures; no tricky keywords.<br>  <br>  Esper is all about Artifacts and rewarding you for having lots of them. It has a lot of varying effects based on card types. My Esper deck is by far my best deck; it's focused on what we call a 'control' strategy, so it just makes sure that i get the upper hand, and keep it, through a long game full of really elaborate effects and strategies.<br>  <br>  Grixis makes use of a keyword called "unearth". This means you can use board clearing cards to kill off everything, including your own creatures at times, and bring back creatures with unearth for one more turn to do some damage when your opponent's stuff is all gone. It has a lot of discard effects for you and your opponent, and requires you to think a lot about whats in your graveyard and how you can use it to your advantage.<br>  <br>  Jund, like Grixis, doesn't care about your small creatures. Instead of killing them and reviving them though, you feed them to larger creatures with an effect called 'devour', which ads +x/+X to your larger creatures based on how much it ate. You end up making a lot of 1/1 creatures and feeding them to a big dragon to boost his power. In both Jund and Grixis, you'll end up taking damage a lot in order to do damage, so it's not a very defensive deck strategy and new players won't be good at it at first.<br>  <br>  There's definitely some complicated strategies in these types of decks, but if you can handle it, i would suggest it. If you want to start a bit simpler, look into the Lorwyn Cycle (Previous cycle). It's the last cycle before Shards, so it's still Standard Legal. It had a lot of two color decks and some single colored decks. It's also a bit complicated with all of it's split mana costs, but it's easy enough to understand.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do would be to talk to friends who play Magic and find out what they suggest. Every Magic player plays a different way, and the people you're going to be playing with will influence how you play the most.

440d4a17aefc552ef492e82a97f3ffefaa	he could very well have a problem. <br>  1 when he is playing online at your house he is probably playing a tournament which could take anywhere from an hour to 9 hours so really if he is three hours in he wouldnt want to be disturbed too much. because one mistake and he cold lose and be out.<br>  \]<br>  I would tel him he cant play at your house anymore whether he likes it or not. I can tell you i do play poker for a living and i have supported myself for years doing this, but along the way i have seen many many people keep shelling out money they dont really have to try and get even.<br>  <br>  You saying that he stays at the casino late even though he has to go to work in a few hours, this just makes me think of those type guys. Losing a 1000$ to them is the same as losing 300$ because once they get past a certain point their judgement is impaired all they think about is staying in the game and trying to get even. which happens but not very often<br>  <br>  So really you have to make a decision for yourself. either u can be with someone like that or not. YOu seem to be the only one working on this relationship, and if he taakes poker over yo thats his loss and your gain. You might like him  but if you cant change him its time to kick him to the curb lol thats so mean isnt it.<br>  this doesnt really mean he has  problem but i have a hunch he does. <br>  One other thing you could bring up to him is this.<br>  Most poker players play with a bankroll, Try to have him save up for a few weeks say like a thousand $ he can then use that money say he buys in for 100$ at a game. he will have ten chances to make money. If he loses all that and wants to keep playing he has to get a side job or something to that extent to make his extra gambling money that way he doesnt lose his paycheck just his spending cash. If he doesnt have a problem gambling he shouldnt have a problem with this idea,<br>  If he tell you to mind your won business wht he does with his money then its time to pack it in|`|d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	It sounds like it.  From a non-money point of view, it sounds like he is spending most of his free time gambling, and ignoring you and everything else other than absolute necessities.  I think it is a bad sign that he is visiting you but instead of spending time with you, he is ignoring you and going online to gamble.<br>  <br>  As far as money, it really depends on how much he is losing overall, how much he makes from his job, and how much available money he has.  You can't really look at how much he loses in any one night, because maybe he has won on other nights.  I would want to know his results from a long term point of view rather than for one night,  Losing $150 per day (about $54,000/year) would be disastrous for most people, but losing $150 (or even $1000) on any one day may not mean a whole lot in the long run if he makes up for all or most of his losses when things are going well.  But if he is really losing his paychecks, then it sounds like he mostly loses and he is losing money he needs for other things.  Also the drinking makes it worse, because if he is playing games of skill (like poker or blackjack) it will affect his judgment and he won't play as well.|`|rIMA15PLaa	If he's to the point of lying about it, then there's either a problem with his gambling, his relationship with you, or both.

8s1qiWMZaa	Hi.<br>  If you like fighting game then i suggest you Street Fighter 4. It a must.This game has a great in-depth combos and great visual.<br>  But if you like shooter games i suggest you to wait for Killzone2.It has really great graphics and the online play is AWESOME!!<br>  I played the Demo and was very impressed.<br>  So it's up to you to make the choice.|`|972OdSIJaa	i would get street fighter 4 but i dont know why your even bother getting killzone 2. i got a ps3 but i aint getting killzone 2 cuz i know its crap.
9prBDg9Zaa	This is from an archer guide.<br>  <br>  Level 10-20: Mushroom garden<br>               The Hill East of Henesys<br>  <br>  Mushroom garden is located two maps west of Henesys. It's a secret area at the<br>  top of the map. There are some mushroom houses, press Up on the entrance of one<br>  of them and you will be sent to mushroom garden. In that map, there are orange<br>  mushrooms, small orange mushrooms and snails. It's not as crowded as Henesys<br>  hunting grounds, and the experience is as good.<br>  <br>  The hill east of Henesys is one area at the bottom right of the town. There is<br>  a slime platform there, and you can snipe them without being hit. I don't<br>  recommend slime tree, since the area is not flat, and that's bad for an archer.|`|4pwnNGvWaa	Pig beach. Pigs have 120 hp each. about half the map is flat.

J9RIyBDxaa	Dhalsim is a slow character in Street Fighter.  He uses the body stretches and teleportation to make up for his lack of speed.  Your cousine could still use this character to fight but he can't just rush in the fight.  He have to take his time and time his hits and use the teleportation skill to dodge and surprise his opponents.  I have this game for the PS3.  Its pretty good I hope you enjoy.|`|VP8TiqEmaa	They all fight slowly the game sucks, its terrible <br>  <br>  I have never been so angry over a purchase before
TtuSkz39aa	Yea it is quite fun if you want to just talk to people... if you want to talk to people and do quests and other activities then i suggests Runescape.<br>  <br>  www.runescape.com<br>  <br>  This is a very good online game and you dont have to download it like IMVU. Also, once downloaded, IMVU can slow down your computer because thats what it did to mine.<br>  <br>  Runescape is alot better and more enjoyable...it will keep you much more amused and you wont get bored of it after 10 minutes like you would with IMVU.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|yyIVrngcaa	its for adults! its a 3d chat environment...stick to your video games on tv!

mOAY4FbJaa	I think it's called motion-capture technology.  It's hard telling whether they will use it in producing future video games since computer graphics have become so much more realistic.  I doubt if we will see it much unless a game publisher simply wants to have a specific actor play a role in a particular game.

mesqZ1mUaa	So you don't have to spend a lot of time waiting for people to arrive, it's absolutely best if you can get the first rainbow completed by the end of Spring so newcomers can start arriving. The next 2 rainbows then can't be completed until fall.<br>  <br>  As far as personal relationships, I'd have figured out who you want to marry and make sure you have at least 3-4 hearts. If the person you want to marry hasn't arrived yet, then I'd work on getting the villagers hearts up.<br>  <br>  You should also be shipping as much as possible, so that Brownie Ranch, Souffle Farm and the general store expand their inventories. You also want to be working on your tool skill level and going into the mine so you can upgrade your tools, so they use less energy.<br>  <br>  There are 2 power berries that you can get rather easily as well - 1 on the bottom of the Ganache Mine and one when you increase your fishing rod up to level 3.

The animation/graphics are excellent and there's a lot more to do.  Your Sim kids aren't kids forever and stuck at the house with you.  Of course, this aging also means that adult Sims get old and die.  <br>  <br>  I too, miss parts of Sims 1.  I had Career Creator, so I had made lots of interesting careers for my Sims.  I had a Jedi Career for my Jedi sims.  It was great!  I also miss the expansions.  Sims 1 had great expansions.  They could have pets, go on vacation, become stars and make magic.  It was sweet.<br>  <br>  All in all though, I prefer Sims2.  Hopefully Maxis will listen to the fans soon and make Sims able to have pets and do magic and other stuff.  Oh, and make nannies competent.  I hate the nannies!

The mother asks the oldest boy what he’d like to eat. "I’ll have some fuckin’ French toast," he says. The mother is outraged at his language, hits him, and sends him upstairs. She asks the middle child what he wants. "Well, I guess that leaves more fuckin’ French toast for me," he says. She is livid, smacks him, and sends him away. Finally she asks the youngest son what he wants for breakfast. "I don’t know," he says meekly, "but I definitely don’t want the fuckin’ French toast."<br>  <br>  2<br>  <br>  <br>  My grandfather always said, "Don't watch your money; watch your health." So one day while I was watching my health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather. (Jackie Mason)<br>  <br>  3<br>  <br>  <br>  Last night I went to a 24-hour grocery. When I got there, the guy was locking the front door. I said, "Hey, the sign says you're open 24 hours." He goes: "Not in a row!" (Steven Wright)<br>  <br>  4<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul is working in his store when he hears a booming voice from above: "Saul, sell your business." He ignores it. It goes on for days. "Saul, sell your business for $3 million." After weeks of this, he relents, sells his store. The voice says ‘Saul, go to Las Vegas." He asks why. "Saul, take the $3 million to Las Vegas." He obeys, goes to a casino. Voice says, "Saul , go to the blackjack table and put it down all on one hand." He hesitates but knows he must. He’s dealt an 18. The dealer has a six showing. "Saul, take a card." What? The dealer has -- "Take a card!" He tells the dealer to hit him. Saul gets an ace. Nineteen. He breathes easy. "Saul, take another card." What? "TAKE ANOTHER CARD!" He asks for another card. It’s another ace. He has twenty. "Saul, take another card," the voice commands. I have twenty! Saul shouts. "TAKE ANOTHER CARD!!" booms the voice. Hit me,Saul says. He gets another ace. Twenty one. The booming voice goes: "un-*******-believable!"<br>  <br>  5<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy joins a monastery and takes a vow of silence: he’s allowed to say two words every seven years. After the first seven years, the elders bring him in and ask for his two words. "Cold floors," he says. They nod and send him away. Seven more years pass. They bring him back in and ask for his two words. He clears his throats and says, "Bad food." They nod and send him away. Seven more years pass. They bring him in for his two words. "I quit," he says. "That’s not surprising," the elders say. "You’ve done nothing but complain since you got here."<br>  <br>  6<br>  <br>  <br>  I was making love to this girl and she started crying. I said, "Are you going to hate yourself in the morning?" She said. "No. I hate myself now." (Rodney Dangerfield)<br>  <br>  7<br>  <br>  <br>  A Jewish grandmother is watching her grandchild playing on the beach when a huge wave comes and takes him out to sea. She pleads, "please God, save my only grandson. I beg of you, bring him back." And a big wave comes and washes the boy back onto the beach, good as new. She looks up to heaven and says: "He had a hat!" (Myron Cohen)<br>  <br>  8<br>  <br>  <br>  Two guys are walking down the street when a mugger approaches them and demands their money. They both grudgingly pull out their wallets and begin taking out their cash. Just then one guy turns to the other and hands him a bill. "Here’s that $20 I owe you," he says.<br>  <br>  9<br>  <br>  <br>  I went to my doctor and told him "my penis is burning." He said, "That means somebody is talking about it."

(Henny Youngman)<br>  <br>  11<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus and Saint Peter are golfing. St. Peter steps up to the tee on a par three and hits one long and straight. It reaches the green. Jesus is up next. He slices it. It heads over the fence into traffic on an adjacent street. Bounces off a truck, onto the roof of a nearby shack and into the rain gutter, down the drain spout and onto a lilly pad at the edge of a lake. A frog jumps up and snatches the ball in his mouth. An eagle swoops down, grabs the frog. As the eagle flies over the green, the frog croaks and drops the ball. It’s in the hole. Saint Peter looks at Jesus, exasperated. "Are you gonna play golf?" he asks "Or are you just gonna **** around?"<br>  <br>  12<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy enters bar carrying an alligator. Says to the patrons, "Here’s a deal. I'll open this alligator's mouth and place my genitals inside. The gator will close his mouth for one minute, then open it, and I'll remove my unit unscathed. If it works, everyone buys me drinks." The crowd agrees. The guy drops his pants and puts his privates in the gator's mouth. Gator closes mouth. After a minute, the guy grabs a beer bottle and bangs the gator on the top of its head. The gator opens wide, and he removes his genitals unscathed. Everyone buys him drinks. Then he says: "I'll pay anyone $100 who's willing to give it a try." After a while, a hand goes up in the back of the bar. It's a woman. "I'll give it a try," she says, "but you have to promise not to hit me on the head with the beer bottle."<br>  <br>  13<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy meets a hooker in a bar. She says, "This is your lucky night. I’ve got a special game for you. I’ll do absolutely anything you want for $300, as long as you can say it in three words." The guy replies, "Hey, why not?" He pull his wallet out of his pocket, and one at a time lays three hundred-dollar bills on the bar, and says, slowly: "Paint…my…house."<br>  <br>  14<br>  <br>  <br>  At a White House party, a woman approached Calvin Coolidge, famed for his silence, and said "Mr. President, I made a bet I can get more than two words out of you." He replied: "You lose."<br>  <br>  15<br>  <br>  <br>  L.A. is so celebrity-conscious, there's a restaurant that only serves Jack Nicholson -- and when he shows up, they tell him there'll be a ten-minute wait.

The guy says, "We would. But we need the eggs."<br>  <br>  18<br>  <br>  <br>  I was raised half Jewish and half Catholic. When I'd go to confession, I'd say "Bless me, father, for I have sinned -- and you know my attorney, Mr.Cohen." (Bill Maher)<br>  <br>  19<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy dies and is sent to Hell. Satan meets him, shows him doors to three rooms, and says he must choose one spend eternity in. In the first room, people are standing in **** up to their necks. The guy says "no, let me see the next room." In the second room, people are standing with **** up to their noses. Guy says no again. Finally, Satan opens the door to the third room. People are standing with **** up to their knees, drinking coffee and eating danish pastries. The guy says, "I pick this room." Satan says okay and starts to leave, and the guy wades in and starts pouring some coffee. On the way out Satan yells, "O.K., coffee break's over. Everyone back on your heads!"<br>  <br>  20<br>  <br>  <br>  Jack Benny is walking down the street, when a stick-up man pulls out a gun and says "Your money or your life!"

Finally Benny says "I’m thinking!"<br>  <br>  21<br>  <br>  <br>  A man is driving his five year old to a friend’s house when another car races in front and cuts them off, nearly causing an accident. "Douchebag!" the father yells. A moment later he realizes the indiscretion, pulls over, and turns to face his son. "Your father just said a bad word," he says. "I was angry at that driver, but that was no excuse for what I said. It was wrong. But just because I said it, it doesn’t make it right, and I don’t ever want to hear you saying it. Is that clear?" His son looks at him and says: "Too late, douchebag."<br>  <br>  22<br>  <br>  <br>  On a passenger flight, the pilot comes over the public address system as usual and to greet the passengers. He tells them at what altitude they’ll be flying, the expected arrival time, and a bit about the weather, and advises them to relax and have a good flight.. Then, forgetting to turn off the microphone, he says to his co-pilot, "What would relax me right now is a cup of coffee and a *******." All the passengers hear it. As a stewardess immediately begins to run toward the cockpit to tell the pilot of his slip-up, one of the passengers stops her and says "Don’t forget the coffee!"<br>  <br>  23<br>  <br>  <br>  I was so ugly when I was born, the doctor slapped my mother. (Henny Youngman)<br>  <br>  24<br>  <br>  <br>  Two campers are walking through the woods when a huge brown bear suddenly appears in the clearing about 50 feet in front of them. The bear sees the campers and begins to head toward them. The first guys drops his backpack, digs out a pair of sneakers, and frantically begins to put them on. The second guys says, "What are you doing? Sneakers won’t help you outrun that bear." "I don't need to outrun the bear," the first guy says. "I just need to outrun you."<br>  <br>  25<br>  <br>  <br>  TV commercials now show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you've got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem. (Jerry Seinfeld)<br>  <br>  26<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy has a talking dog. He brings it to a talent scount. "This dog can speak English," he claims to the unimpressed agent. "Okay, Sport," the guys says to the dog, "what’s on the top of a house?" "Roof!" the dog replies. "Oh, come on..." the talent agent responds. "All dogs go ‘roof’." "No, wait," the guy says. He asks the dog "what does sandpaper feel like?" "Rough!" the dog answers. The talent agent gives a condescending blank stare. He is losing his patience. "No, hang on," the guy says. "This one will amaze you. " He turns and asks the dog: "Who, in your opinion, was the greatest baseball player of all time?" "Ruth!" goes the dog. And the talent scount, having seen enough, boots them out of his office onto the street. And the dog turns to the guy and says "Maybe I shoulda said DiMaggio?"<br>  <br>  27<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy shows up late for work. The boss yells "You should have been here at 8:30!" he replies: "Why? What happened at 8:30?"<br>  <br>  28<br>  <br>  <br>  When I went to college, my parents threw a going away party for me, according to the letter. (Emo Philips)<br>  <br>  29<br>  <br>  <br>  A lady at a party goes up to Winston Churchill and tells him, "Sir, you are drunk." Churchill replies, "Madam, you are ugly. In the morning, I shall be sober."<br>  <br>  30<br>  <br>  <br>  I was born a suspect. I can walk down any street in America and women will clutch their purses tighter, hold onto their Mace, lock their car doors. If I look up into the windows of the apartments I pass I can see old ladies on the phone. They’ve already dialed 9-1- and are just waiting for me to do something wrong. (Chris Rock)<br>  <br>  31<br>  <br>  <br>  I worked some gigs in the Deep South…Alabama…You talk about Darwin’s waiting room. There are guys in Alabama who are their own father. (Dennis Miller)<br>  <br>  32<br>  <br>  <br>  In football you wear a helmet; in baseball you wear a cap. Football is concerned with downs; baseball is concerned with ups. In football you receive a penalty; in baseball you make an error. In football the specialist comes in to kick; in baseball the specialist comes in to relieve somebody. (George Carlin)<br>  <br>  33<br>  <br>  <br>  I want to have children, but my friends scare me. One of my friends told me she was in labor for thirty six hours. I don’t even want to do anything that feels good for thirty-six hours. (Rita Rudner)<br>  <br>  34<br>  <br>  <br>  A guy has a parrot that can sing and speak beautifully. He takes it to the synagogue on Rosh Hashonah and makes a wager that the bird can conduct the High Holiday service better than the temple’s cantor. When the big moment comes, though, the parrot is silent. The guy is outraged. He takes the bird home and is about to kill it when the bird finally speaks: "Schmuck! Think of the odds we’ll get on Yom Kippur!"<br>  <br>  35<br>  <br>  <br>  At the airport they asked me if anybody I didn’t know gave me anything. Even the people I know don’t give me anything. (George Wallace)<br>  <br>  36<br>  <br>  <br>  I always look for a woman who has a tattoo. I see a woman with a tattoo, and I’m thinking, okay, here’s a gal who’s capable of making a decision she’ll regret in the future. (Richard Jeni)<br>  <br>  37<br>  <br>  <br>  If this is coffee, please bring me some tea. If this is tea, please bring me some coffee. (Abraham Lincoln)<br>  <br>  38<br>  <br>  <br>  I celebrated Thanksgiving in an old-fashioned way. I invited everyone in my neighborhood to my house, we had an enormous feast, and then I killed them and took their land. (Jon Stewart)<br>  <br>  39<br>  <br>  <br>  This greasy spoon restaurant was so bad, on the menu there were even flies in the pictures. (Richard Lewis)<br>  <br>  40<br>  <br>  <br>  There’s always one of my uncles who watches a boxing match with me and says "Sure. Ten million dollars. You know, for that kind of money, I’d fight him." As if someone is going to pay $200 a ticket to see a 57-year-old carpet salesman get hit in the face once and cry. (Larry Miller)<br>  <br>  41<br>  <br>  <br>  Three guys, stranded on a desert island, find a magic lantern containing a genie, who grants them each one wish. The first guy wishes he was off the island and back home. The second guy wishes the same. The third guy says "I’m lonely. I wish my friends were back here."<br>  <br>  42<br>  <br>  <br>  I was thrown out of NYU. On my metaphysics final, they caught me cheating. I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me. (Woody Allen)<br>  <br>  43<br>  <br>  <br>  I know a guy who called up the Home Shopping Network. They said "Can I help you?" and he said "No, I'm just looking." (George Miller)<br>  <br>  44<br>  <br>  <br>  Three comedians are shooting the breeze at the back of a nightclub after a late gig. They’ve heard one another’s material so much, they’ve reached the point where they don’t need to say the jokes anymore to amuse each other – they just need to refer to each joke by a number. "Number 37!" cracks the first comic, and the others break up. ""Number 53!" says the second guy, and they howl. Finally, it’s the third comic’s turn. "44!" he quips. He gets nothing. Crickets. "What?" he asks, "Isn’t 44 funny?" "Sure, it’s usually hilarious," they answer. "But the way you tell it…"<br>  <br>  45<br>  <br>  <br>  A Jewish guy goes into a confession box. "Father O’Malley," he says, "my name is Emil Cohen. I’m seventy eight years old. Believe it or not, I’m currently involved with a 28 year old girl, and also, on the side, her 19 year old sister. We engage in all manner of pleasure, and in my entire life I’ve never felt better." "My good man," says the priest, "I think you’ve come to the wrong place. Why are you telling me?" And the guy goes: "I’m telling everybody!"<br>  <br>  46<br>  <br>  <br>  Contrary to what most people would say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It’s a shark riding on an elephant’s back, just trampling and eating everything they see. (Jack Handey)<br>  <br>  47<br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing I know about Africa is that it's far, far away. About a thirty-five hour flight. The boat ride's so long, there are still slaves on their way here. (Chris Rock)<br>  <br>  48<br>  <br>  <br>  Last year, I deducted 10, 697 cartons of cigarettes as a business expense. The tax man said, "Don’t ever let us catch you without a cigarette in your hand." (Dick Gregory)<br>  <br>  49<br>  <br>  <br>  Animals may be our friends. But they won’t pick you up at the airport. (Bobcat Goldthwait)<br>  <br>  50<br>  <br>  <br>  Sid and Irv are business partners. They make a deal that whichever one dies first will contact the living one from the afterlife. So Irv dies. Sid doesn't hear from him for about a year, figures there is no afterlife. Then one day he gets a call. It's Irv. "So there is an afterlife! What's it like?" Sid asks. 'Well, I sleep very late.

So now<br>  head straight to the last room of this area (which has the hole and the<br>  well). Enter the hole.  This takes you back to alternate room 302 an you need to dump the key in your inventory box.

Get Clash of Ninja 2.  Previously know an Taijutsu Battle Taisen (I think) for the Japanese version.  Much better ^_^|`|911ae33d49524c3ec0bfcce678aebb97aa	it depends on what you like, but Naruto clash of the ninja 2 just came out (i think because my friend has it) and i read that you can battle with 3 other people, so it's like a 2 on 2 sometimes but not all the time, if you were to ask me I'm a Naruto fan so i would go with Naruto.|`|c3f6cdcf68eea864a077ab16f2e9e377aa	I read a review on Clash of Ninja. It has some cool stuff in it, but it doesn't match up to the previous arcade style games. Dragonball Z would probably be your best bet (unless your a Narutard like me). But Clash of Ninja 2 is out, and it's a lot better than Clash of Ninja 1. so if your a Naruto fan, get Clash of Ninja 2 instead (unless it's sold out).

WU7wpxe7aa	yeah much better i hav all the final fantasy games and the best 1 for me is final fantasy 7|`|DkVofG9paa	what final fantasy are your talking about? my favorite was FF8|`|d2FJBJ8baa	hard to say because a lot of people say 7 was the best one. Having not played 7, i think 10 was the best one<br>  <br>  the game graphics and battle system definitely have gotten better as technology improves but if you are asking for the sake of the storyline then i would say older FF are better.<br>  <br>  overall i would say the game has improved, but i still think FFX had the best story line... i almost cried every time i play trough it|`|NJ25E4AZaa	Final Fantasy has gotten better. It did loose it's classic feel and battle system after 10, but I really liked 12. I thought the new battle system was great. I'm really looking forward to 13 having the same.|`|YK9eGkoiaa	i haven't played many series but yes it was better especialy  the battle style  FF X-I any one know when FF XIII realese date is OR VII REMAKE ??????|`|7Lmdrxicaa	yeah, I think FF VII is far better than FF XII, also the battle system. I hope they could have a battle system like the one in Crisis Core. thats the best they ever had :D|`|233V4qcsaa	Its hard to say it seems since squaresoft teamed up with enix they have went a bit downhill i mean look at ff 10 part 2 that was the first ff they done together.<br>  <br>  And all the over rpgs they are doing seem to be more action based not the traditonal turn based system i prefer the old ones eg; ff6/ff7<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and 13 isnt the same as 12 its turn based but very fast paced

w4qS66aqaa	The Action Replay DS (abbreviated ARDS, AR) is one of a line of products manufactured by Datel, specifically designed for use with the Nintendo DS. It is used to apply cheat codes to alter a game, usually by giving the player extreme advantages not normally obtainable. While earlier versions of the software forced users to input codes manually via the DS itself, versions 1.52 and later allows users to enter codes through a PC application, which are copied to the software via USB. [1][2]<br>  <br>  In addition to functioning as a cheat device, with recent firmware versions, Action Replay DS can be used as a NoPass device by holding Select when powering on the system. However, this feature is not officially documented. It was added in version 1.02.[3]<br>  <br>  Action Replay DS is sold in stores all around the world with a suggested retail price of $24.99 USD[citation needed], but at "big box" stores like Target and Wal-Mart, the price is often reduced to $19.99. In Australia, it is $49.99 AUD. In Britain, it is ￡14.99<br>  <br>  YES IM GONNA GET PLATINUM!!|`|j7P5QAt7aa	lol you can buy it at places like target, walmart, and even gamestop i think.

154dzJ1Faa	There is no rhyme nor reason why people buy what they do.  I belong to a weaver's guild and we have an annual pre-Christmas sale.  Every year, we try to guess what they will want... and are wrong every time!  One year, we sell massive amounts of tea towels, and the next year, it's scarves, and some years it could be rugs.  We can never predict it!<br>  <br>  If you have an item that is quite unique, very special, really cute and wonderful to touch, unlike anything they can find at WM, then they will sell really well.  You have to make something that says quality all the way through it, is something totally unique and not duplicated anywhere else by anyone other than you.  And it can be anything.<br>  <br>  If you are going to make those acrylic embroidered plastic canvas things... well, that probably won't sell that well.  Or maybe in your area, they do!  There's no accounting for taste.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	It is amazing what people will buy. It is equally amazing what people consider as art.

9prBDg9Zaa	It's not against the law, since it states in the sites, such as www.basilmarket.com, which is a site where you could sell items or accounts for US $, that they are certified of approval of legal promotion in overseeing other users selling their game accounts.<br>  <br>  In other words, it's not illegal.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Well, while technically its possible, I doubt the company would go that far unless you were an account company selling 100s of accounts.  1 account they won't go after.  But yes, its illegal, and technically you could get in big trouble.<br>  <br>  The problem is that it isn't yours.  According to the T&S of the contract you agree to, you are esentially RENTING it, and the rights to the account stay with the company that runs the game.  So basically, you are selling what isn't yours.  Thats why its illegal.|`|fOTRTMPsaa	LEGAL trouble? i don't think you can be in too much legal trouble but you can be ip blocked and/or get your account deleted from the game.|`|JdmwlvSRaa	oh yes|`|2oc6TDiGaa	whats the problem with selling your acount?

TlgCPFhSaa	If you want to make mills and have no trouble doing it i have a few suggestions...<br>  One great way to gain money is to do aviances, it takes at least 70 range and 70 defence. To do this you will need a zamorak, armadyl, and a saradomin item.<br>  I advice that if you are short on money to use...<br>  Some short of helm with defence such as barrows <br>  Armadyl pendant <br>  Blk d'hide body<br>  Legs with defence such as barrows, rune, dragon<br>  Snakeskin, rune, or dragon boots<br>  Zamorak, or Saradomin book<br>  Zamorak or Saradomin cape<br>  Broad or mithril bolts<br>  rune c'bow<br>  Ring of life<br>  <br>  What you should have in your inventory is<br>  Bones to peace tabs<br>  Nature runes<br>  Fire staff<br>  Teleport tab<br>  Some ranging and super defence pot<br>  <br>  What you need to do is walk or teleport to godwars dungeon (bring a rope if its your first time)<br>  Once you get to God wars climb down the rope head south. Once you head south you should run into flying bird like creatures called aviances, the range from lvl 69-131. <br>  Start killing these and they will drop noted addy bars which you pick up<br>  They also drop rune daggers alot which you alch<br>  <br>  So keep picking up the bars and alching the daggers and you will be rich!<br>  Once you run out of food start picking up the bones, get a full inventory and use a tab. <br>  <br>  You will be able to stay here for days without banking as long as you use your b2p tabs.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions mesage me on the game<br>  sn0 0 0py|`|zrj8jhssaa	stop playing runescape and get a job|`|YdQOpsHCaa	kill cows (lvl 2) and collect items from them and sell them.

But, for $160 you can pick up a brand new arcade console from Dell so why would you pay $100 for a used Pro???<br>  <br>  Peace!<br>  The Reverend|`|GNxhkuXIaa	The XBox itself is the exact same, the only difference is the fact that one has a hard drive and the other doesn't.  The Arcade doesn't have internal memory, it comes with a 256MB external memory card.  If you have a memory card, you're fine.  If not, just save up and buy a hard drive for it.  You won't be able to save your games unless you have an external memory card or hard drive.

y02PZj22aa	Make the outside layers first.  Just take the ribbon you are using, cut the lengths you want, double them over, and string the number you want on a thread (I recommend nylon monofilament).  <br>  <br>  My distance/spacial perception isn't the greatest, but I'd start with 2" wide ribbon, cut 6" long, and I'd cut 12 of them and cut a point on the cut end.  You may see that as a different width, different length, and different number; give it a try with what you interpret the size to be.<br>  <br>  Then make the rose with the ribbon you want and the number of points you want.  Add it to the other ribbons on the thread.  Arrange them to duplicate the picture and adjust the length of the outside layers if necessary.  When you have them like you want them, stitch them into place with the monofilament thread and attach the resulting rose to a hair clip.

3a1975c1d3efc66ea03bee3d9eac475eaa	NO! Sony took a huge hit when they released the ps3 Tons of 60gb machines sold and almost no 20gb ps3 sold they sold over 22,000 al together but they wound up loosing 143million dollars. If you dont know what this means i will tell you "THE PS4 WILL NOT COME OUT FOR A LONG TIME" or atleast untill they sell enough to make up for  the lost profits. Also little tip it will not be called the PS4 they are still deliberating on the name. And another inside tip if you connect your PSP to the ps3 vis the usb witha special optical cord (best buy.com) you will get message (Bypass enitiated Ps3 centeral graphics overide) in other words you just killed your ps3... SOO DO NOT DO IT! if some one tells you to they are just tryin to piss you off.|`|614134358d03a1c6e2c8f43577f05879aa	Right now Im more focused in the fact if sony will even go out of business before 08' than thinking if or even there is going to be a ps4 .|`|71e19744d3786ab2cdd8669910c561c8aa	Ahh... ps3 just came out.

But, I think it probably will.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No.  The PS4 will not make a 2010 launch.  Why?  Because it's only 4 years down the road, and the PS3 will most definitely last longer than 4 years.  It might make a 2011 or 2012 launch.  <br>  <br>  The Playstation brand is not going away anytime soon.  There is no way that the PS3 will be the last home console from Sony.  The Playstation brand is a cash cow.  And there's no way that Sony is going to go the way of Sega.  Sega had to go from hardware to software because the Dreamcast was a huge failure.  Sega lost a huge amount of money.  The only way for Sega to be profitable was to ditch the hardware business and go into the software business.  Sega only has the game console and software to keep it afloat.  Sony has other things besides the PS brand to keep it afloat.|`|b44f42e86833b7eed016c290e03c1254aa	sure and it'll prolly cost 1200 bucks|`|1bd507cc93264e2fb0ad686a592a8c3daa	sure...after everyone runs sony outta business, thre is gonna be holographic telephone conversations, and pigs will fly...jk... maybe|`|44de744a4479adacc73b356aa292432faa	Welllll....rumors are hitting the net that there may not be a ps4. Ken Kutaragi has been named President of Sony and he is a "software guy" so some "experts" have said Sony may do what Sega did a few years back and just make games and software. Go to G4tv.com and they have a few articles about it.  ;)|`|89f1ef4e5b6aba28a7bfdad98b67d43caa	Maybe they won't make a ps4 since nobody has ever gone that far. maybe they'll make a psp2 or call it something else. Like the game-cube instead of making a game-cube 2 they made a wii.

AA12165015	When you try getting in lounge or room and it doesn't work. click on pop up blocker. always allow tab it will say recent pop ups blocked. high light yahoo.com then click allow. This is the proper way to use the pop up blocker, and in past 5 months I have never had a problem or had to hold any keys down to get in.1st thing you do when you get in lounge is check small windows in options box. once in room make sure you  expand it to see chat area.  this also gets rid of the big ads. <br>  Here is an easy fast way into games.

The first thing that I would do is to check and make sure the game is not still installed on your computer.  If you check in your Start Menu, select Programs and look for anything marked "EA" or "Sims", if you find something, make sure the folder is empty.  If it's not, select the Uninstall option.  Once the program is uninstalled (assuming it was still on your system), you may want to run a virus checking program (Norton Anti-Virus or McAfee Anti-Virus).  Try installing the game again and checking if it will work.<br>  <br>  Another thing to check is the DirectX tool.  It will show you all of your system information.  Press and hold the "Windows" key (it's located between the Ctrl and Alt keys on the bottom-left side of your keyboard) and press R.  This will bring up the RUN dialog box.  Type in dxdiag and press Enter.  This will bring up the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.  The first thing you should see is a tab showing your Processor speed, RAM memory, Video card, etc.  Make sure your computer can run the game.  If it can, you may want to update your video card drivers.  Outdated video card drivers can cause alot of crashes.  Look at the Video Card information, go on Yahoo or another search engine site and type in that card name, it should bring up the site for the company that makes it.  Go to the site and find the Driver download area and update your drivers.  Updating your Audio drivers would probably be a good idea too.  Audio driver information should be in the DirectX Diagnostic tool too.  Just search the name in Yahoo and you should be able to find it.<br>  <br>  Once that is done, if you try to install the game again and it still locks up, find the area on your hard drive where the game was originally installed and delete the folder and remaining files.  Probably the same with the Makin' Magic EP.  You will probably lose all your previous save information and have to start over, but it's better to do that than not be able to play the game anymore, right?  If you delete the old files and it STILL wont reinstall, you may have a more serious problem on your hands.  It might be in your best interest to have your computer looked at by a professional at this point.<br>  <br>  If the game DOES meet the system requirements AND you are able to reinstall it, but it still crashes alot, find the executable file (you should have a shortcut to it on your desktop, that'll work too), right-click on the icon, select Properties.  When the Properties box appears, select the Compatibility tab, click on the first check box that you see marked "Run in Compatibility Mode for:" and select Windows 98.  If that doesnt work, you may want to try contacting EA again.  I know it's a pain, but you might actually get someone that can help you this time around.<br>  <br>  I hope that all helps!  Good luck!

A search of the forums will reveal mixed results. Some people with high spec machines are getting lower frame rates than people with lesser spec machines.<br>  <br>  And remember, frame rates aren't everything. You could get lower frame rates than someone else, but possibly have a "smoother" sim, which is more important.<br>  <br>  Try some of the tweaks on the forums to improve things.<br>  <br>  One thing - if you only have a 20gb drive, you may want to look at an upgrade.

Upon entering the tunnels go straight ahead and keep going until you reach a place where you have to turn either left or right. There will be a small rock on the wall that is clickable. That will let you into the 2nd hidden chamber.<br>  <br>  #3. Follow the directions to chamber #2 but turn left when you reach the left or right choice. Go straight until you reach a point where you must turn right. Turn right and the wall in front of you will again have a clickable rock.

92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	Haha but great games also have some horrible sequels.<br>  <br>  I'm sure they ended it like that to see how it was going to take off, it was a completely different type of game and it could have gone either way. More than likely I can see them making another one but I doubt anytime soon, especialy with Halo 3 and Halo Wars about to be out. I could see them waiting for those two games to get a lot of money pulled in and to cool off, and then bust out with GoW 2.<br>  <br>  P.S. And with the way Microsoft is run, GoW 2 would no doubt be released in Nov. ^.^ If you think about it anyways, all Halo series are released then, Halo Wars will be. All consoles are practically released in that month. And Gears was released that month. It's like a trend.<br>  <br>  Edit- Alexmojo, my 360 went out too at the beginning of Dec. I refused to pay the $140, I filed a BBB complaint like many others. And recently just before Christmas they were fixing 360's for free and they are fixing mine right now for free. You should call them and ask them about it, if they refuse it then write a BBB complaint and i'm sure you will get it. They surprisingly called my house for my address to send the box, etc. They will fix ALL 360'S you just sometimes have to fight for it, and right before the holidays it took me 6 times before I could speak to anyone that wasn't a complete ********.|`|eceb3733dac41acb2209ee932703be3eaa	Of course there will be a sequel.

Desejava algo lógico que n?o dependesse de sorte para ganhar, mas sim de raciocínio. <br>  <br>  Foi ent?o que o bramane Sissa encantou o rei, apresentando e explicando o nome das pe?as, seus movimentos e o que cada uma representava no reino onde viviam. <br>  <br>  Após toda a explica??o e de terem, inclusive, jogado uma partida, o rei agraciado com o sábio lhe perguntou o que queria em troca do t?o criativa inven??o. <br>  <br>  - Nada quero - respondeu Sissa demonstrando além de muita sabedoria bastante humildade. <br>  <br>  Entretanto, depois de insistentes pedidos o sábio disse que n?o queria ouro, palácio, nem terras, deixando bem claro que o objetivo dele era deixar o rei satisfeito e que somente a alegria transmitida era seu pagamento, mas visto que o nobre rei sentia-se ofendido em n?o recompensá-lo, Sissa respondeu que queria seu pagamento em gr?os de trigo. <br>  <br>  Explicou que os gr?os de trigo deviam ser colocados sobre o tabuleiro de xadrez (que tem 64 casas), sendo que na primeira seria posto 1 gr?o, na segunda 2, na terceira 4, 8, 16, e assim dobrando sucessivamente... <br>  <br>  A principio o rei e todos que estavam à sua volta riram dizendo ser ridículo o pedido dele e que estava desperdi?ando a concess?o dada. <br>  <br>  O sábio reafimou sua decis?o e continuou insistindo no pedido, até que o rei ordenou para que um de seus empregados trouxesse alguns sacos de trigo para que pudesse pagar os servi?os oferecidos por Sissa. <br>  <br>  Foi ent?o que come?ou a distribui??o dos gr?os. Porém, quando estavam chegando nas trinta e duas casas do tabuleiro concluíram após alguns cálculos que se juntasse todo o trigo do mundo n?o daria para pagá-lo e precisaria de toda produ??o de trigo da época na índia cultivada por mais de 60.000 anos, sendo que o total corresponderia a 2.305 montanhas (o número exato é 18.446.744.073.709.551.616 gr?os)! <br>  <br>  Diante disso, surpreso, o rei n?o soube diferenciar o que foi mais inteligente: o jogo ou o pedido que o sábio fez? <br>  <br>  Naturalmente, Sissa já sabia que seria impossível pagá-lo daquela maneira e liberou o rei de cumprir seu pedido! <br>  <br>  Conta ainda a lenda que o rei, percebendo a grande sabedoria de Sissa, pediu com insistência para que ele permanecesse trabalhando como primeiro ministro e pudesse com seus conhecimentos aconselhá-lo, beneficiando o povo e auxiliando estrategicamente na seguran?a de seu reino... <br>  <br>  <br>  Defini??o<br>  <br>  O xadrez é apontado como o jogo mais intelectual dos praticados no mundo, gra?as ao seu aspecto artístico, científico e competitivo. <br>  <br>  é um jogo que se assemelha à guerra, onde um exército luta contra outro dispondo do mesmo número de elementos no início da partida. <br>  <br>  O tabuleiro representa o campo de batalha e as pe?as s?o de aparência e movimentos diferentes, sendo elas rei, dama (ou rainha), torre, bispo, cavalo e pe?o, cada pe?a representando em seus movimentos uma figura de antigamente. <br>  <br>  <br>  Regras e no??es elementares<br>  <br>  Elementos do jogo de xadrez <br>  <br>  Tabuleiro: o jogo é disputado em um tabuleiro de 64 casas (8x8) de cores alternadas. <br>  <br>  O tabuleiro se divide em casas, colunas, fileiras e diagonais. <br>  <br>  Casa - menor parte do tabuleiro, sendo em seu total 64. <br>  <br>  Colunas - conjunto de casas dispostas em uma mesma linha vertical. <br>  <br>  Fileiras - conjunto de casas dispostas em uma mesma horizontal. <br>  <br>  Diagonais - conjunto de casas da mesma cor em dire??o inclinada. Ao todo s?o 26 diagonais, sendo a menor duas casas e a maior oito. <br>  <br>  Objetivo do jogo <br>  <br>  Antigamente, ou até hoje em alguns países, o rei é a figura mais importante. Como o propósito do invento era proporcionar alegria ao rei, n?o poderia ser diferente: seu objetivo único é a morte do rei adversário!<br>  <br>  <br>  Rei - Já que o objetivo do jogo é prendê-lo, n?o seria coerente ele ficar movimentando com freqüência. Por isso seus movimentos s?o t?o limitados. <br>  <br>  Por ele ser o rei, tem o livre-arbítrio de mover para todos os lados, com a seguinte limita??o: apenas de uma em uma casa de cada vez.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dama - Também conhecida pelos amadores por rainha, é a pe?a mais poderosa do jogo de xadrez. Por ter um raio de a??o muito grande, com ela você pode mover nas horizontais, verticais ou diagonais, semelhante aos movimentos do rei, com a diferen?a de poder mover quantas casas desejar!<br>  ica: a dama tem os mesmos movimentos da torre e bispo em uma só pe?a. <br>  <br>  Torre - Antigamente era usada como arma de guerra. Subiam nela soldados armados para poder observar com seguran?a quando houvesse aproxima??o de tropas inimigas. Essas torres eram móveis, porém muito pesadas, tendo que ser movimentadas somente em linha reta, pois possuía rodas que poderiam ser quebradas se empurrada em diagonal, além da facilidade de tombá-la.<br>  <br>  Por tudo isso a torre anda somente pelas horizontais e verticais quantas casa tiver à disposi??o.<br>  <br>  Bispo - Representa a religi?o do reino. Alguns historiadores contam que antigamente ao invés de bispo, curiosamente, essa figura era representada no "jogo dos reis" através do elefante, que na índia é sagrado e aclamado com venera??o religiosa.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Obs: no jogo de xadrez existem dois bispos no início de cada partida, um fica na casa branca (mais clara) e o outro na casa preta (mais escura); podendo cada um andar quantas casa dispuser, contando que n?o saia da diagonal de sua cor e n?o utilize duas diagonais em um só movimento. <br>  <br>  Dica: os bispos fazem o movimento contrário ao das torres.<br>  <br>  Cavalo - Representa os cavaleiros do rei, que conseqüentemente eram os mais bem treinados soldados da guarda real. O cavalo anda somente em "L" de quatro casas. Contando a casa em que está como 1, a seguinte 2, a outra como 3, forma-se uma reta e ent?o é só virar para a direita ou esquerda completando a 4a casa e automaticamente o lance estará completo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dica: o cavalo é a única pe?a que salta sobre as outras. <br>  <br>  Pe?o - O pe?o nada mais é que um soldado do rei. Tendo por objetivo a promo??o e a defesa de seu superior. <br>  <br>  O pe?o movimenta-se de uma em uma casa sempre para frente, sendo que se estiver em sua casa inicial poderá andar duas casas de uma só vez. <br>  <br>  Dica: o pe?o é a única pe?a que captura de maneira diferente da qual se move, ou seja, anda para frente, mas captura na diagonal no raio de uma casa.         <br>  <br>  Pronto, agora que já sabemos todos os movimentos das pe?as, vamos para a coloca??o inicial do tabuleiro e das pe?as. <br>  <br>  <br>  O tabuleiro e as pe?as<br>  <br>   Dica: o tabuleiro de xadrez n?o pode ser colocado de qualquer maneira. A regra diz o seguinte: a casa de cor branca (a mais clara) deve ficar sempre do lado direito. <br>  <br>  Você que está aprendendo, agora vamos montar as pe?as no tabuleiro. Utilizando a primeira fileira do tabuleiro, fa?a o seguinte: <br>  <br>  1o passo - Pegue as duas torres de mesma cor e coloque uma em cada canto do tabuleiro. <br>  <br>  2o passo - Pegue os dois cavalos de mesma cor e coloque um do lado de uma torre e o outro da outra torre. <br>  <br>  3o passo - Pegue os dois bispos de mesma cor e coloque uma do lado de um cavalo e o outro do outro cavalo. <br>  <br>  4o passo - Agora que sobrarm duas casas, é fácil. Se a dama for de cor branca ficará na casa branca e se for de cor preta ficará na casa preta.<br>  <br>  5o passo - Já o rei, será colocado na casa que sobrar dessa fileira.<br>  <br>  6o e último passo - Os pe?es visam a defesa das pe?as maiores, portanto existe em maior quantidade sendo que cada um fica na frente de cada pe?a, completando a segunda fileira do tabuleiro.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pronto, agora que já conhece todos movimentos precisa fixar bem o objetivo do jogo. <br>  <br>  Xeque: é quando o rei encontra-se amea?ado, mas existe a possibilidade de defender-se. <br>  <br>  Existem três op??es para defender o rei no caso de xeque. S?o elas:<br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  Xeque-mate: é quando o rei está amea?ado e n?o existe nenhuma das três defesas acima. Ocasionando o término da partida! <br>  <br>  <br>  Movimentos excepcionais<br>  <br>  Promo??o: é quando o pe?o atinge a 8a horizontal, visto que ele n?o pode voltar e cumpriu seu objetivo que era chegar ao fim da linha (conhecendo, invadindo, atacando e mapeando o terrritório inimigo!), ent?o ele automaticamente será promovido a outra pe?a para poder voltar. A pe?a a ser escolhida fica a seu critério: dama, torre, bispo ou cavalo. <br>  <br>  Roque : é um movimento combinado de rei e torre, que vale por uma só jogada que tem por objetivo a seguran?a do rei e uma maior mobilidade para a torre pelas colunas centrais. <br>  <br>  Quando n?o se pode fazer o roque:<br>  <br>  1. Se já tiver movimentado o rei ou a torre do lado em que deseja fazer o roque.<br>  2. Se tiver em xeque ou for ficar depois de completar o movimento "roque".<br>  3. Se passar com o rei por casa atacada no momento do movimento.<br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  En passant: acontece quando um pe?o está na 5a casa e o pe?o adversário em sua casa inicial. Quando este avan?ar duas casas e ficar ao lado dará a oportunidade ao adversário de tomar este pe?o, como se ele tivesse caminhado apenas uma. <br>  <br>  Tente acompanhar pelo exemplo do diagrama ao lado: <br>  <br>  Observe que o pe?o branco encontra- se na 5a casa. O pe?o que estava na casa inicial andou duas. Ent?o o condutor das brancas optou em tomar "en passant". Nesse caso pode tomar o pe?o como se ele tivesse caminhado apenas uma. <br>  <br>  Dica: esse movimento pode ser feito por qualquer dos pe?es, mas é somente válido no instante do lance. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Afogamento<br>  <br>  Esse tipo de posi??o que requer bastante aten??o em virtude de seu aparecimento com freqüência em partidas de iniciantes, gerando dúvida comum sobre situa??o. <br>  <br>  Afogamento é aquela posi??o que o rei n?o está em xeque e n?o tem casa para mover ou qualquer outro movimento possível para fazer. Quando esse fato acontece de n?o ter nenhum movimento possível, sendo a vez de jogar, a partida é declarada empatada. <br>  <br>  Veja esses dois exemplos:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Observe que em ambos os casos o rei preto n?o tem lugar para mover, mas n?o está obrigado a jogar, pois n?o se encontra em xeque.

Computer-controlled opponents and allies tend to run headlong into gunfire, wander off ledges, and walk into walls (Particularly evident in the Kamino level, where enemies tend to wander off the sides of the platforms during combat). IGN felt that this, along with redundant use of planets featured in previous Star Wars settings, were problems carried over from the original Battlefront.[4]<br>  <br>  IGN also noted that the complex controls and graphics of space battles and all-hero battles can make online multiplayer games virtually unplayable. Moreover, IGN felt that Lag times and high ping rates can cause the action to become choppy, objects and players to disappear, and weapons to become ineffective. [5] A related criticism from Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) is the longer load time needed between boards, which is also caused by more detailed graphics and larger maps than the original Battlefront.[6]<br>  <br>  Official criticism of the PSP version revolves mainly around the platform's ability to handle the game, rather than the game itself. Although the graphics were slightly stripped down to improve load times, EGM found Battlefront's controls to be too complex for the PSP's simple controls. EGM cited further problems with the game's slowdown in multiplayer mode
