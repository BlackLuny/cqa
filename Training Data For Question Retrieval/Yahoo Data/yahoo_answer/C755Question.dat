I like to drink when I get together with friends but I end up saying a lot of things I regret - secrets, conspiracy theories, private things, just way too much 411. I did it again the other day and am too embarassed to face some of the people. How can I stop myself when I'm in that situation, from speaking too much? I don't want to cut the drinking because it's fun and it's only once in a while, but I want to cut the chattter that comes out of my big mouth! help!!

If so will they do more harm than good?  And f.y.i. for those of you who want to know I say alcohol and tobacco are in the sin industry because of the large number of deaths that they cause when compared side by side and daily to street drugs.

I bought 2  cases of glass bottled Martinelli's from my store when they were on sale and put one in my room and one in my (cooler) garage. Tonight I open one of the Martinelli's in my room and it tasted really flat! I look at the expiration date and it says "Best By 09:31 02OCT 2011 W" Huh? What's that mean?  The Martinelli website says their products in glass should last for three years,  but the taste... is it just from the heat of my room or have all my bottles including the ones in the garage gone bad because I didn' t read the expiration properly? A little help...

I try not to generalize people but the bar I used to work at in college constantly had skirmishes between women.  There were the occasional men who would throw down but the overwhelming amount of trouble seemed to come from women.  I used to think it was in reverse and sort of do, but my work experience has caused me to rethink this.  I think it might just be the type of women our bar caters too.  Single 21-40 working women.  Seriously it is not fun breaking up cat fights.

20090203122417AAzRMYD	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What are your healthy breakfast, lunch, or dinner recipes?	Everyone, what are your favorite low cal and nutritional meals? This should be some good inspiration and resources for everyone on this board. :-)      I'll share one of mine:      Dinner:    steamed pesto chicken breasts (serves 2)      In your steamer, assemble 2 6-oz chicken breasts, 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth, 4 Tablespoons fresh basil, minced fine, 4 cloves minced garlic, dash each of salt and pepper, 1/4 cup white wine, and 2 Tablespoons toasted pine nuts. Steam for 20 min., or until chicken is all the way cooked.       Serve with brown rice pilaf (serves 2)      Saute 1 cup shiitakes, sliced (or other mushrooms), one med. onion, minced, and 1 clove of garlic, minced, in 1/2 cup of low-sodium chicken broth. When onions are translucent, add 1 C. of cooked brown rice, and season with Spike. Heat rice through and serve.      Awesome green beans:      1 lb green beans   2 Tablespoons toasted sesame seeds   2 oz prosciutto, cut in tiny pieces   1 Tablespoon olive oil      Brown prosciutto pieces in pan, and toast sesame seeds. Set aside. In skillet, heat olive oil and cook green beans until tender. Toss with sesame seeds and prosciutto.       One of my 'hints' is to use chicken or beef broth when sauteeing anything, instead of olive oil or butter - serves the same function, while adding NO fat, and almost no calories (only 10 cals. for 1 cup of this stuff.)

My motto is that if the food is to be eaten with a fork, the shrimp should have no shells or tails. I've eaten tons of dishes where I've had to set my fork down, peel the shrimp, and take the tails off before I could even eat it.      What's the deal? Are the cooks just being lazy?

I have chicken broth, not beef. Would that be ok? And I bought them with no insight as to how I would marinate them. I have the basics, garlic, cayenne pepper, habenero peppers, bbq, A1, worcestire, Umm IDK various things. So, I dont eat meat and dont know what would work best. Also, if stove top alone or browned than crock pot would be better.

However, I think my nutrition is suffering as I just realized I haven't had anything to eat in the past 2 days except for 3 yogurts and some cashews.  It just seems I eat less food than before, and I also notice that I haven't been keeping up with my proteins.      I think I want to go back to eating meat for the nutrition, but just the idea of it is unappealing to me.  What can you do to get over this hump?
