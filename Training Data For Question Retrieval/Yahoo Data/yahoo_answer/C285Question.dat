Im a 28 yr old cappy girl,I like a 26 yr old cappy guy,we used to work together and we talked sometimes but other times we were shy around eachother,were friends on myspace but havent seen each other in almost 4 months,we have so much in common and I like him so much,I started telling him on myspace messages that I think hes really cool and stuff but my question is how can I tell if he likes me or not? I know us capricorns take love very serious and like to take things slow,should I tell him I think hes the hottest guy I know and that I like him or will it scare him off? Should I wait for him to come to me,he has problems with depression and social anxiety so I dont think it would be easy for him to approach me!

20090223113115AAqiTrZ	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	[?] Anime/Manga Survey [?]?	[?] Anime/Manga Survey [?]       Alrighty then, this is the first survey I've ever made, so don't yell at me too loudly if it fails horribly.    Best answer goes to whosever answer that stands out the most; be it the funniest, or the most interesting or whatever. You don't have to copy & paste if you don't want to, but atleast number your answers, please.    Also, I'm going to completely ignore any answers that fall along the lines of "I don't know, I have a life!", to anything akin to that.      [1] Who are your top three favourite anime or manga characters. Give one reason why. (If you don't know why you like a character, then it's fine to put "I don't know")      [2] Pick any character from an anime or manga: if they were to take a job in today's society, what would it most likely be? If they already have a job, put down what job they do hold, what job they want to hold or what job you could see them in.      [3] If you knew them in real life, which anime/manga character would be most likely to be your best friend?      [4] Have you ever been motivated to watched/read an anime/manga for a reason other then actually liking what you're reading/watching? (I don't know if I made much sense on that, but for example, you watched an anime just because your favourite band did the opening theme, instead of actually being interested in what the anime is about.)      [5] Favourite character who's ever worn an eyepatch or bandage over an eye? Doesn't have to be permanent; they could've just worn it for one episode or something.      [6] Remember those guys you picked for the first question? Pick one and tell me your favourite quote from them.      [BONUS]      Here are some lyrics from an anime/anime movie/OVA/ONA/whatever; What song is it, what band sings it, and what's it from:      Run and run!   Run and run!   Kaze ni nari hashire   Sa kinou no omae wo koeteyukunda   Tachimukae jibun yori ookina mono ni   Sou sa wakasa wa moetsukinai ryuusei da

Seriously though, I'm curious to see if this has ever happened to anyone else.  For the first oh, half-dozen or so years that I studied piano, I had a stutter.  Not vocally, but musically.  I would play the same note or chord over and over again.  It's like my brain would just stop functioning and the little record player inside my head would start skipping.  I eventually got rid of it, although it was not easy.      When speaking, I was not a stutterer at all.  Maybe occasionally, but it definitely wasn't a problem like it was with the piano.      Did any of you ever stutter on the piano?  (Or whatever instrument you may have been playing.)  And did you ever stutter when speaking?  I'm incredibly curious to see if there is any sort of relation, or if I'm just weird.  (Of course, I already know that I'm fairly weird, but you get the point!)      Thanks      -Ryan K

20090223114655AAt4hTt	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	What do you think about this song I wrote? (lyrics)?	This is like a slow R&B/Hip Hop song, The verses are to be rapped on and the chorus is sung.      Dew      Verse: It all started in the damp driveway.   Your word pulled up and didn't let me pull away.   Stiff fingers on the clutch, as such, hearing a lil too much.   Time to shift it and put a new gear.   Glancing down at the letters, cue the fear,   that never again will I see a word that sincere.   Somehow my nikes still applied pressure,   even though popping letters seem to let ya,   almost seem I just met ya.      Ripples on top of my kissed coffee cup.   Maybe if I opened my car window,   it'll look like it was caused by the delight of the duck.   Goin 27 miles per in the streets,   but speedin like hell was the heartbeat..   What am I doin? Have I lost it?   End of the show yet the curtain won't start fallin.   Already my salty pride is tossin,   another jacket of love away in my life,   Thru the foggy glass I thought inside...      Chorus: I am gone.   I am gone.   It was after the morning you came, to say your last complaint.    That everything went wrong.   You see the dew from the rain, gives me something to relate.   Cuz I am a soaking tree that is now saying it's too late.   I am gone.      Verse: Pink striped, navy-iced, ones all nice and dotted,   you can name any kind of skirt, and I thought about it.   How it used to glow thru my fingers,   as if it were sequins of a Saudi.   Damn, Ima miss having keys to that 'Maserati'.    But I doubt it.   That I can stand the unpredictability of the ride one more time.   You knew what could have been done, and I'm so sick of what it outta be.   Cuz no matter what,   I'm gonna long for all of the sparkling glee,   of being with my one and only L-O-V-E.      Roaring and fading are the wheels passing by.   It reminds me of what our relationship was like.   From us having nothin between our eyes, to us starting fights.   ****, it was like we were just rolling dice.   I had to pull over and turn the ignition key.   When I started seeing memories of you kissin me.   And although my face was all wet, drippin blue.   I knew it'll be neglect to my heart if I stay with you.   So what I gotta do, is follow through,   on something that was long overdue.      Chorus: I am gone.   I am gone.   It was after the morning you came, to say your last complaint.    That everything went wrong.   You see the dew from the rain, gives me something to relate.   Cuz I am a soaking tree that is now saying it's too late.   I am gone.      Bridge: You left me with no choice, but to stop all the noise.    I gotta start all over again.   The chances I know were few,   but you didn't leave me with no clue.   Now instead of saying 'I do',   you got me saying good-bye boo..      Chorus: I am gone.   I am gone.   It was after the morning you came, to say your last complaint.    That everything went wrong.   You see the dew from the rain, gives me something to relate.   Cuz I am a soaking tree that is now saying it's too late.   I am gone.      ? L.C. aka "Izteca Soul" 2009

20090223071245AAbpxab	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Here are the differences Between Man and Women! Are you ready to read patiently?! What is your opinion?	Well! Please read fully! I swear you people will surely enjoy!       Names:      If Mary, Susan, Claire and Barbara go out for lunch, they will call each other Mary, Susan, Claire and Barbara.      If John, Brad, Tony and Daniel go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bruno, Scrappy, Peanut-Head and Godzilla.      Eating Out:      When the bill arrives, John, Brad, Tony and Daniel will each throw in $20, even though the total is only $34.25. None of them will have any smaller bills and none will admit they want change back.      When Mary, Susan, Claire and Barbara get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.      Money:      A man will pay $10 for a $5 item he needs.      A woman will pay $5 for a $10 item that she doesn't need, because it's on sale.      Bathrooms:      A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, razor, shaving cream, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Motel 6.      The average number of items in a woman's bathroom is 328. The average man would not be able to identify most of them.      Arguments:      Women always have the last word in an argument. Anything a man adds after that is the beginning of a new argument.      Cats:      Women love cats.      Men may say they love cats, but when women are not looking, will men kick cats.      Future:      A woman worries about the future -- until she gets a husband.      A man never worries about the future -- until he gets a wife.      Success:      A successful man is one who makes more money than can be spent by his wife.      A successful woman is one who can find that a man.      Marriage:      A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't.      A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change, and she does.      Dressing Up:      A woman will dress up when she goes shopping, empties the garbage, answers the phone, waters the plants, gets the mail and reads a book.      A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.      Natural:      Men wake up looking as good as when they went to bed.      Women will somehow deteriorate during the night.      Children:      A woman knows all about her children. She knows about their best friends, romances, secret hopes and dreams, favorite foods, fears and dental appointments.      A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.      Thought for the Day:      Married men should forget their mistakes. There is no need for two people to remember the same thing.      Thanks for your time!!      Disclaimer: 0% serious and 100% fun! hehe      Star and rate if you like! OK? :o)

20090223121053AATdInC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Do you think this is BS?	You may have remembered me asking about the talent show and what I should do. Well i tried out last week and it seemed i didnt do my best but I had talent. Two days later, we were all called out to see who made it, and I didn't but thats not why I got angry. A group of kids did a group act about the mcdonalds rap and the school said they had serious talent and put in a lot of thought into it. even though I am not mad about it now, isn't that just crap? Anybody can rap because it takes NO talent, but not everyone can play guitar which was what I did.   WHAT DO U THINK

I know at concerts you are allowed, but on the other hand, you aren't allowed when seeing broadway shows. So I'm a bit confused.      Any experience/knowledge would be very much appreciated.

20090223120805AADQ23d	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Have the Oscar Awards become a butt of a joke?	I think it has.  The worst thing about this year's Oscars has to be Heath Ledger getting an Oscar.  Now don't get me wrong; I think it's terrible that this young actor died so prematurily in such a tragic maner, but that should not be THE reason to give him an Oscar! Lets face it, if he hadn't died, not only DN would not have become a blockbuster (it would have done no better than the last Batman movie) but it would not even have been mentioned at the Oscars!   This "awards" show is nowadays inseparable from politics and lobyists!  It is no longer a show where THE BEST are awarded, and it is no longer fun.  Even the post-oscars reviews (EG: L. A. Times Oscars best & worst) are ridiculous and laughable.

20090223114358AAO63Uw	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What do you think about this song I wrote? (lyrics)?	This is like a slow R&B/Hip Hop song, The verses are to be rapped on and the chorus is sung.      Dew       Verse:    It all started in the damp driveway.                Your word pulled up and didn't let me pull away.                Stiff fingers on the clutch, as such, hearing a lil too much.                Time to shift it and put a new gear.                Glancing down at the letters, cue the fear,                that never again will I see a word that sincere.                Somehow my nikes still applied pressure,                even though popping letters seem to let ya,                almost seem I just met ya.                    Ripples on top of my kissed coffee cup.                Maybe if I opened my car window,                it'll look like it was caused by the delight of the duck.                Goin 27 miles per in the streets,                but speedin like hell was the heartbeat..                What am I doin? Have I lost it?                End of the show yet the curtain won't start fallin.                Already my salty pride is tossin,                another jacket of love away in my life,                Thru the foggy glass I thought inside...       Chorus:    I am gone.                  I am gone.                  It was after the morning you came, to say your last complaint.                   That everything went wrong.                  You see the dew from the rain, gives me something to relate.                  Cuz I am a soaking tree that is now saying it's too late.                  I am gone.       Verse:   Pink striped, navy-iced, ones all nice and dotted,               you can name any kind of skirt, and I thought about it.               How it used to glow thru my fingers,               as if it were sequins of a Saudi.               Damn, Ima miss having keys to that 'Maserati'.                 But I doubt it.               That I can stand the unpredictability of the ride one more time.               You knew what could have been done, and I'm so sick of what it outta be.               Cuz no matter what,               I'm gonna long for all of the sparkling glee,               of being with my one and only L-O-V-E.                   Roaring and fading are the wheels passing by.               It reminds me of what our relationship was like.               From us having nothin between our eyes, to us starting fights.               ****, it was like we were just rolling dice.               I had to pull over and turn the ignition key.               When I started seeing memories of you kissin me.               And although my face was all wet, drippin blue.               I knew it'll be neglect to my heart if I stay with you.               So what I gotta do, is follow through,               on something that was long overdue.       Chorus:    I am gone.                  I am gone.                  It was after the morning you came, to say your last complaint.                   That everything went wrong.                  You see the dew from the rain, gives me something to relate.                  Cuz I am a soaking tree that is now saying it's too late.                  I am gone.       Bridge:    You left me with no choice, but to stop all the noise.                  I gotta start all over again.                 The chances I know were few,                 but you didn't leave me with no clue.                 Now instead of saying 'I do',                 you got me saying good-bye boo..       Chorus:    I am gone.                  I am gone.                  It was after the morning you came, to say your last complaint.                   That everything went wrong.                  You see the dew from the rain, gives me something to relate.                  Cuz I am a soaking tree that is now saying it's too late.                  I am gone.       ? L.C. aka "Izteca Soul" 2009

We always hear       'the rules'    From the female side       Now here are the rules from the male side                  These are our rules!       Please note... they are all numbered '1' ON PURPOSE!           1.   Men are NOT mind readers.-----neither are women, if we act like something's wrong, then there usually is something wrong! lol      1.    Learn to work the toilet seat.   You're a big girl.   If it's up, put it down.   We need it up, you need it down.   You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.----learn how to put it down! you zip it then you flip it!! if you can put it up, surely you can put it down.      1.    Sunday sports It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.   Let it be.---my reality shows/soaps/favorite shows, either watch them with me or get lost lol      1.    Crying is blackmail.--crying is how we express our emotions, it's just how we are deal with it! :) i      1.    Ask for what you want.   Let us be clear on this one!  Subtle hints do not work!  Strong hints do not work!  Obvious hints do not work!   Just say it!--very true, i can't dispute this one.      1.    Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.----so is "i'm not in the mood" lol      1.   Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it.   That's what we do.   Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.--i don't agree, sympathy shouldn't be one sided. if you don't have any, you're heartless anyway      1.    Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.   In fact, all comments become Null and void after 7 Days. ---wrong again, if you didn't mean it you shouldn't have said it, fyi, we may forgive but we never forget what you said      1.    If you think you're fat, you probably are.---haha, no comment! i'm not fat      1.    If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one. ---lol..cute!      1.   You can either ask us to do something Or tell us how you want it done.   Not both.   If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself. ---lol, that sounds like something i would say..no argument there      1.

20090223122427AAQRuoU	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	How do you overcome fear of playing in public?	I feel that my fear really hinders my playing. My hands start to shake and I can't concentrate. This is not a very good combination because I cannot sight read for beans, and have to memorize everything I play. Trembling hands aren't great for accuracy and sometimes my mind blanks even on really easy passages that I never had trouble playing at home.      At home I can practice perfectly fine, play for my friends, or sometimes when I'm at school I play during break and there are a couple of people in the room and I'm still okay. It's once I'm up there performing for an actual grade and ears are on me I feel totally helpless.       My teacher says performing gets easier once you are used to it, but I don't really think so. He also said that I need more confidence in my playing, but that's easier said than done.       So do you guys get extremely nervous performing infront of others? Did you overcome your fear? And how did you do it.

They couldn't do it while he waited, so he said he didn't live far and would just walk home.      On the way home he stopped at the hardware store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. He then stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, struggling outside the store he now had a problem - how to carry his entire purchases home.      While he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. She asked, 'Can you tell me how to get to   1603 Mockingbird Lane ?'      The farmer said, 'Well, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house I would walk you there but I can't carry this lot.'      The old lady suggested, 'Why don't you put the can of paint in the bucket. Carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?'      'Why thank you very much,' he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home      On the way he says 'Let's take my short cut and go down this alley. We'll be there in no time.'      The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me.. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?'       The farmer said, 'Holy smokes lady! I'm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?'      The old lady replied, 'Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens.'

20090223131837AAscHmN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Haha funny jokee...easy points!?	Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, " He is such a sweet and gentleman, he would never go for this carrying on." So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand.Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans.All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, "Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight." He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife,the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone. The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a "Happy Birthday"!!!

20090223124933AApyxZ5	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Schumann's Papillon Finale and Carnaval Finale... Any connections?	So, we all know that the Carnaval was an expansion of sorts off of the Papillons. And also in the Carnaval in the Florestan, Schumann "quotes" the Papillons, in the 19 measure...      So with all these connections, I Was thinking of both of the finales. The begining melody of the papillons finale and the despairing melody starting at Molto pui vivace in the carnaval are rather similar. Do you think this is a coincidence or did Schumann use the melody in the papillons and mutate it into a despairing minor key with some variants?       You're opinion?

20090223122650AALMjer	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why are people so crazy about Robert Pattinson? He isn't Edward Cullen?	I understand that Edward is supposedly like the most beautiful and perfect specimen on the planet Earth, but seriously I think that some people have the hardest time differentiating fantasy from reality and are projecting all their obsessions and personal fantasies onto Robert.  I read an interview that was done with him and he is completely baffled by all the sudden attention he has been getting since having the role of Edward in the movie. There was a girl that even asked him to bite her and she was devastated when he told her no! Did she really think he was going to turn her into a vampire? It's just mind-boggling to me. If I saw Robert on the street I probably wouldn't even bother him. I would be a little pleased, sure but he is a person too. Just because he happens to have this profession and is on tv all the time doesn't make him anymore glamorous than any of us. He doesn't seem like the 'diva' type. I personally don't get why all these fan girls are throwing themselves all over him all the sudden. I watched a Twilight special a couple months ago on The Tyra Show that featured him and Taylor Lautner and the show had his name as 'Edward Pattinson'.. how embarrassing is that? I wonder how Rob is handling all of this pressure. I almost feel bad for him for having all these people hording him everywhere. I do believe he has some genuine fans out there that aren't delusional, but apart from them hopefully all the craziness will die out. But that aside, what is with them?

20090223124422AANYyis	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Why does everyone talk about the economic/environmental/lack of attention  problems with Duggars?	I think the real problem that I have with the Duggars is the fact that their home is more like a prison camp then a home. The older kids take care of the younger kids and the 13 and 14 year old make breakfast lunch and dinner for what is now? 20 people? And the fact that they have no freedom, or true aspirations or goals, make me hate them even more. The kids are literally brainwashed and you can expect all of them to be popping out as many puppies as Mommy and Daddy because that's all they know. The closest thing they have come to the real world is their "mission trip" during which Jim Bob carted the family to a poor country where he didn't speak the language, give REAL aid, and only proceeded to suck up more resources to keep his family comfortable on the trip. Transportation, food, beds, water, all being wasted on showing his 17 kids the "real world". A third world country is all those kids have seen (no tv or internet) of course they would think that sex and tv would cause such hardships as those in a third world country. I think the brainwashing and the kids not even getting a chance to live their lives is the true problem with these people. Anyone else?

On the lighter side of life…………                   One year, a husband decided to buy his mother-in-law a cemetery plot    as a Christmas gift.      The next year, he didn't buy her a gift.      When she asked him why, he replied, "Well, you still haven't used the       gift I bought you last year!"      And that's how the fight started.....      **************************************...       My wife walked into the den & asked "Whats on the tv?"      I replied "Dust".       And that's how the fight started.....      **************************************...       A woman is standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror.       She is not happy with what she sees and says to her husband, 'I feel       horrible; I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to pay me a       compliment.'       The husband replies, 'Your eyesight's damn near perfect.'       And that's how the fight started.....       **************************************...       My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming       anniversary. She said, 'I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 200          in about 3 seconds.       I bought her a scale.       And that's how the fight started.....       **************************************...       I asked my wife, 'Where do you want to go for our anniversary?'       It warmed my heart to see her face melt in sweet appreciation..       'Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!' she said.       So I suggested, 'How about the kitchen?'       And that's when the fight started....       **************************************...       My wife and I are watching Who Wants To Be A Millionaire while we were          in bed. I turned to her and said, 'Do you want to have sex?'       'No,' she answered.       I then said, 'Is that your final answer?'       She didn't even look at me this time, simply saying 'Yes.'       So I said, 'Then I'd like to phone a friend.'       And that's when the fight started....                  **************************************...       I tried to talk my wife into buying a case of Miller Light for $14.95.          Instead, she bought a jar of cold cream for $7.95. I told her the beer          would make her look better at night than the cold cream.       And that's when the fight started.....         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...   I took my wife to a restaurant. The waiter, for some reason, took my       order first.       'I'll have the strip steak, medium rare, please.'       He said, 'Aren't you worried about the mad cow?'       'Nah, she can order for herself.'       And that's when the fight started.....

20090223133349AAOhWHk	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Are hip-hop artist/fans too politically correct these days?	Q1: We all know there's garbage out there but it seems like a lot of artists and fans won't name, names today, because they're afraid of being called a hater. If you think about it any hip-hop artist who came out and said another was wack in the past few years, everyone makes a big deal out of it and everything is blown out of proportion and it's all over youtube, hip-hop sites ect and they're labeled a "jealous hater" or something along those lines. You used to be able to say this guy is wack, this guy is garbage, and the ones who truly sucked would be weeded out and quit, the ones who really had something would try harder to prove you wrong. I'm sure at one point all the emcees and producers we love have been told their rhymes are wack, their beats are wack, and it just made them work harder. So do you think because of this politically correct attitude that there is today, that is why there is such a loose concept of what a dope rhyme/ beat is, who's a dope emcee and who's a dope producer?      Q2: When a legend starts to fall off, why are people so reluctant to say so? Is it out of respect for their past accomplishments, or are they again afraid of being called a hater or is it a combination of the two?

20090223142226AAt8WyP	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P...Peepssssss Lyrics...?	What do you thinkkkkkkkkkk            There's a baby on the 7th floor and the fire keeps growing,   Her Mother's on the ground shouting 'Save her".   But it's amazing in her greatest desperation she still has time,   To think inside her mind 'Where's God when you need him'.      I want to grow into a Bee so I can fly away from humanity,   Cause right now it's looking as though it's going to fall through.   People stop to stare at the sun but they never do see,   The stars at night as the form shapes in the sky.      Beauty is more then skin deep when your walking alone,   The heart inside you chest just keeps beating down roads.   You've lived your life by the book that you have read,   Now your looking back thinking to yourself 'When have I lived".      As trees burn in the summer sky the smoke rises,   Humanity doesn't believe that all good things come to an end.   So they keep pushing to keep the perfection steady,   Not knowing there tearing down the foundation.      As I bee I will sting and then go and die,   Cause I've had enough of this dead feeling that's inside.   God if you can hear me oh wont you send me a memory,   Of a world that's better then this hole that we live in.

SOMETHING there is that doesn't love a wall,      That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,      And spills the upper boulders in the sun;      And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.      The work of hunters is another thing:          5    I have come after them and made repair      Where they have left not one stone on stone,      But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,      To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,      No one has seen them made or heard them made,   10    But at spring mending-time we find them there.      I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;      And on a day we meet to walk the line      And set the wall between us once again.      We keep the wall between us as we go.   15    To each the boulders that have fallen to each.      And some are loaves and some so nearly balls      We have to use a spell to make them balance:      "Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"      We wear our fingers rough with handling them.   20    Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,      One on a side. It comes to little more:      He is all pine and I am apple-orchard.      My apple trees will never get across      And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.   25    He only says, "Good fences make good neighbors."      Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder      If I could put a notion in his head:      "Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it      Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.   30    Before I built a wall I'd ask to know      What I was walling in or walling out,      And to whom I was like to give offence.      Something there is that doesn't love a wall,      That wants it down!" I could say "Elves" to him,   35    But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather      He said it for himself. I see him there,      Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top      In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.      He moves in darkness as it seems to me,   40    Not of woods only and the shade of trees.      He will not go behind his father's saying,      And he likes having thought of it so well      He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."

20090223133151AAjlqrv	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I miss my Taurus (Guy A) friend so much?	I don't know what else i can do ..i've tried emailing him and texting him and nothing..he and i had some thing going on for the last time and basically it went kinda pear shaped and i feel he's embarrassed and felt guilty of me. I don't want to feel that way but i spoke to him like last few wks ago but that's it. I feel so depressed and out of control of my emotions and yes I think i am in love with him but can't say that i am to him because i don't want my heart broken and it would definately hurt me more as we're friends and i don't think i'd bear to see him with another girl in his arms or kissing him..I know i am jealous even for little things he does in myspace, but i've also been told that he likes me too but needs time to work out what he wants and need in a relationship before he set his heart. I emailed him several times and reads it but doesn't reply back..i dont know if he is seeing someone but if he does, it's okay because i'd like to see him happy and when you love someone a lot you learn to let them go for their happiness..      As for Guy C yes i saw him in Uni today in lecture and looked at me twice but i don't wanna lead him on and hurt him as i've been told that he used to like someone too but the girl has someone else. (Poor guy C) I'd like to be his friend though, nothing more yet until i feel ready to move on.       ...what should i do?

I was just wondering what the hip hop community thought about who has had it worse historically speaking. Who would you say as a WHOLE has gone through the worse?      I know this is a bit weird topic...but I am just curious I have always thought about it. Both races have been through a lot...but who has had it worse?   and I know some might say..you cant compare human suffering...well thats what I am doing.      so i recently asked this same question and most people said things like    "i would say blacks... moe racists moe shooting moe violence"      "I would say Blacks, do to the fact that Latino community still has there historical culture & idenity. They can find out about there roots and have a history to be proud off."      and I am just wondering do these people know what the **** they are talking about? I mean...read a history book   Am I right or what?      Read where Latinos ( I know I use that term loosely....sue me? ) come from...and you'll see what we have to be "proud" of.   and more blacks community in the US have more violence than south america ( South america is the place with the highest crime rate on the planet)...are you joking me?....

It was by Erin something and she was singing about how little boys weren't taught how to treat little girls and little girls weren't taught how to do something and it was apparently after the day she had a one night stand or "gave it up" or something on those lines. I know it's really vague, but can anyone tell me what song it is?

20090223133427AAcL0uv	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What would is a good joke?	Here is an excerpt from my book. I'm 13. Be as harsh as you want to. Lille clutched at the wall with her sweaty, clammy hands, trying not to pass out. She didn't know where she was.               "I must be hallucinating," she though. But she wasn't. This was real. Her mom was walking toward her, her arms open and tears streaming down her face. Except, except this wasn't the mom she remembered. Her mom had a warm demeanor like a crackling fire on a chilly day. This woman was cold and awful. She was whiter than a snowflake falling on the ground.            Lille started shouting, except no words came out. She had gone deaf and mute at the same time. All she could hear was a familiar sound, so distant that it was barely recognizable. It would have been all for the better if this song was indistinguishable. For, at that moment, Lille knew what that tune was as her mom clutched her with her thin hands.          "Why are you doing this to me?!" Lille shouted as she realized that her voice had come back to her.
