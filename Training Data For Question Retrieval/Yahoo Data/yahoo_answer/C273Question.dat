Imagine today is Thursday February 19th.  Which is correct, argument "A" or "B".  To keep it fair I won't even tell you which side I was on!      Argument A-  The this in "This Tuesday" refers to the week.  Since it is Thursday this week's Tuesday already happened.   Therefore this Tuesday was 2/17/09 and next Tuesday is 2/24/09.      Argument B-  Since it's Thursday "this Tuesday" refers to 2/24/09.  Next Tuesday wouldn't be until March 3rd.      The best answer will cite your source.  Good luck!!

20090219211141AAWzUpZ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Can a guy hit a girl if she hits him first?	I want your opinions on this! Girls are always seen hitting guys. It's all over the movies and tv and I've even seen it in real life a few times and most people don't think anything of it! However, when a guy hits a girl he's in BIG trouble! You can't hit a girl! Do you think that if a guy is...lets say, punched by a lady does he have the right to punch her back?       Personally, I don't think physical abuse is correct at all. Whether it be a guy doing it or a girl. How many of you would slap a woman back if she slapped you?

I accidentally watched it the other day and I actually watched it, I then watched the next three episode deliberately. I'm watching it right now! The weird thing is, it's not my sort of programme I would normally hate it. I used to hate it! But now I'm enjoying it, I'm laughing at the occasional joke, I'm identifying with the characters in a meaningful way. I'm thinking bloody hell that is one small baby...Sorry got sidetracked there for a second.      What's wrong with me?! Have I changed? Am I becoming more feminine?! I'm a bloke, for the record!      Is it ok for me to like it? I think it's a crime of nature that I do, for the record. Should I feel wrong? What?!
20090219212402AA8M4VW	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Dating help! Gemini Male/Taurus Female?	He is so tall and funny and smart but I am a firm believer in astrology. He is a Gemini and I am a Taurus. I tried to turn astrology out the window but its hard. I am very straight forward and he is always beating around the bush.      He says he likes me "as a friend" but yet he flirts around with me.      I told him I had a crush on him and that I would "kiss him" and says he wouldn't mind.      We were even suppose to exchange Christmas gifts. I got him a Ralph Lauren track jacket. He told me none of his friends have ever done something so nice for him and he seemed really elated.      I even said he could help me with my squats at the gym (in a flirting way he said when)      I just don't understand. Astrology says to take it slow and keep things interesting but this is my first REAL crush and I'm in college--This is ridiculous. Am I doing too much. Should I contact him less? I really like him and wouldn't mind him being in my corner hes cute, intelligent, and we are in the same major (different minors).      I feel over the top when I'm with him, I find myself getting ready in the morning with him in mind. What am I supposed to do guys? I am so confused.

20090219211455AAlTPri	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Why not more honest "reality shows"? 1/2 the guys on the dating shows  have seemed gay to me, why pretend not?	Who devises those shows, anyway?   From the shows that I have seen:   Most of the women seem either loose, desperate, or like gold diggers, & most of the men seem like they're gay, and on the shows to convince people (perhaps themselves, more than anyone else), that they're not. 'Some of the guys shows have been built around, as well.      Do you get the same impressions, when you see them?   What's up with that?      When when they focus the shows on women, they seem to recruit some of the creepiest and/or most violent characters they can find as potential suitors. ...Causing me to wonder: Do they want us to enjoy the shows, or worry about what happens, when they end?      Get a chuckle out of this, and, share your thoughts.      Oh, and to be clear, I'm cool with gay people. I wonder if these shows thinks it's better to make a show where someone seems to be pretending to be someone they're not, for acceptance, and risks emotionally hurting someone who may genuinely grow to care about them, or could it be better, in advancing the process of acceptance of alternative lifestyles, to just have a show where guys date other guys?

They've been together for 30 years, and continue to produce great music.  And the song writing is ingenious.  Their music has changed over the years, but they've never lost "their sound."  I can't think of another band that has produced so many great albums over such a long span of time.  U2 is washed up and sold out years ago.  Same with Metallica.  They tried to change their sound to adjust to the musical times, but failed.  Yet DM continues to come up with new, original material that doesn't sound like it's been dug out of the recycle bin.

Rihanna, poor girl.?	 http://perezhilton.com/    This is Rihanna by the way, and supposedly Chris Brown hit her and beat her obviously. I never  thought of him as this kind of man, or should I say boy, but I guess we really never know. On a recent article I read, it stated that Chris Brown actually choked Rihanna out, and I know its none of my Business or anything, but it is really starting to bother me that young teen girls and some boys idolize this man, and this is who he really is.       It is disturbing and sad. What do you think about this whole ordeal? I think I find it so close to home because as I was at a young age my father constantly beat my mother, so bad you would not be able to recognize her. It was a scary thing, and luckily my mother stayed strong and left him. I hope she does the same and turns her back on him, because so many woman actually don't turn there backs and end up losing there life's because of it. So what do you think about all of this?

Do people who claim they hate Robert, he say is ugly, he cant act, he is overrated and "they are SO sick of hearing about this guy" waste their time not ONLY: reading the preview of the question, but clicking on it, reading the details, scrolling down to read others response, opting in to answer, preview answer then save the answer?? If you dont like him why are you spending so much time answering questions about him? If you are so sick of hearing about him why are you even clicking on anything remotely attached to him? DOES ANYONE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT!?? Whats more pathetic... people who love Robert and like to talk about him to others who love him OR people who claim to hate the man but spend all their time stalking him on questions so they can waste time typing hateful foolishness about him??

Please explain WHY you would chose something.      1) Suppose there is a burning building with a bunch of people inside- would you rather save 100 innocent children (ages 5-7) or one elderly man who if he survives, will go on to find the cure for Cancer?      2)If you were granted a vital piece of information necessary for the salvation of the human race, but you were going to die 24 hours after recieving it, would you rather give it to the dumbest person on earth (no, not mentally retarted, just incredibly stupid in general) or an evil dictator the likes of Hitler? Which option would increase the chance of survival for mankind, and which would be better for the WELFARE of the human race. Or are they the same?      told you they were hard. haha. thanks.      thanks.

I like them because they're hard enough for me, but they don't just scream into the microphone, the guy can actually sing.  I don't mean to offend by that, it's just my preference to listen for lyrics and rhythm and I like Disturbed's style when it comes to that.        Can anyone recommend any bands that are similar to them?      Thanks!

And others...         I know they probaby get permission, but why the hell can't they come up with their own Shiit?   instead of taking other more talented musicians songs.   Can they not make up a beat on their own?         My personal opinion is, rappers have no talent,    They just sample off good songs to sell their record.      Im trying to find the song ''the way it is'' to download but all i get is fuckiiing tupac.

20090219220419AAS5l7t	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Can I get your point of view on cancer woman?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. She is cancer sign. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. I live pretty far away for work. I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her why I didn't write back before cos I was busy, i love her and that I want to keep seeing her but now she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? (to see my reaction?), I can't focus on work because I always think of her,
20090219221407AArGdLq	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How would you get your revenge?	After you helped him get out of a tight spot with the IRS, your friend Guillermo cooks you dinner to thank you. It’s a decent meal, but (and this is just your luck) he undercooked the chicken and you die of salmonella poisoning. Naturally, you are displeased with this fact and decide to come back as a poltergeist to haunt Guillermo for his fatal culinary error. As a poltergeist, you are invisible and have the ability to move objects. Due to IPL (International Poltergeist Law), you can’t kill him. How do you exact your revenge on Guillermo?

20080324230058AAVmtHp	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	?Hay alguna cancion que te haya cambiado la vida, tu forma de pensar o de ver el mundo?	Pues eso, alguna o algunas canciones que te hayan cambiado la vida para siempre, que hayan cambiado tu forma de pensar o de ver el mundo y en que.       Por ejemplo, hay varias que me han marcado mucho, como por ejemplo, "Dandote Vida" de Vico-C, me a hecho pensar que siempre Dios esta ahi conmigo.       Otra "Chico Problematico" de Nach, me ha hecho ver que es mejor ganarme el respeto en ves de que me tengan miedo, de no andar actuando con violencia, drogas y al final arrepentirme cuando todo ya esta perdido.       Otra "Victoria y Derrota" de Vicky MC y El Elote, me han mostrado que no hay que rendirse ante nada.       "Changes" de 2pac tambien, cuando supe que significaba la letra, tambien a cambiado mi forma de ver las cosas y tratar de unirnos mas.       Asi como esas me han cambiado, hay muchas otra que tambien lo han hecho por eso escucho este genero, el Rap, porque siempre me a ayudado y ma hecho reflexionar, ahora ustedes, que cancion los a cambiado o ayudado de una forma u otra y en que. Saludos

I started playing bass around 2 years ago, just learning the positions of notes on the fretboard and playing for my middle school jazz band. Since I've graduated and left the band, I've kind of been wandering around aimlessly... I just play the root notes of the chords in most songs, and a couple of other notes. I've never taken lessons before, but now I really want to improve... without going through all the boring beginner stuff again! Any suggestions on where to go? I play bass for the worship team at my church, so knowing how to create basslines would be helpful... and lately I've been kind of interested in jazz basslines, too.

Anything.      I play on a Bach trombone that I just finished paying off last November. Another question I had is if dents in an instrument can affect its sound.

20070828061550AAIccDV	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What's this or where do I find this song from Kodomo no Omocha/Kodocha/Child's Toy? First episode 15:34	Hi all. Any fans of Kodomo no Omocha/Kodocha/Child's Toy out there? I've been trying to find a song....or tune....(whichever fits) from this show (which I personally think is brilliant). Much to my chagrin, it seems that all 3 OSTs from the show as well as the Best Collection album do not have this song and I've spent ages trying to find a name or just the song itself, with no success.      It's an instrumental song and I'm not sure if it's a xylophone or a piano that's being played but it's rather quiet-ish.      Fortunately, it was already played in the first episode of the anime at around 15:34 when Rei accompanies Sana to sleep so it shouldn't be too hard to identify it. Or on episode 2 at around 4:30 when Hayama's dad comes in to check on his fever. Anyone have any idea what it's called or where I can find this song?

20081013043140AAupnR9	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Old age smoking jokery?	Jane and Arlene are outside their  nursing home, having a drink and a smoke, when it starts to  rain. Jane pulls out a condom, cuts off the end, puts it over  her cigarette, and continues smoking.        Arlene: What in the hell is  that?       Jane: A condom. This way my  cigarette doesn't get wet.       Arlene: Where  did you get it?       Jane: You can get them at  any pharmacy.       The next day, Arlene hobbles  herself into the local pharmacy and announces to the  pharmacist that she wants a box of condoms.        The pharmacist, obviously embarrassed,  looks at her kind of strangely (she is after all, over 80  years of age), but very delicately asks what brand of condom  she prefers.       'Doesn't matter Sonny, as  long as it fits on a Camel.'       The  pharmacist fainted.

No one ever talks about adult alternative artists on R&P so I'm not sure about what you guys think of it, lol.       It's basically toned-down pop and/or rock music.

I used to listen to the adult alt. radio station in my area ALL the time, when The Fray was my favorite band about 3 years ago. Now? Not at all. I think I grew out of it or something, lol.      So R&P, what do you guys think of the genre?      BQ: Favorite adult alternative bands/singers   BQ2: Favorite adult alt. songs

She made this lame excuse, but she asked me, if i want to be a manager of the team (basically helping her out with certain stuff and training with the team, ) Should i accept this offer or not?       Here is the pros and cons:      Pro:   I will get community service hours for it.   I get to play volleyball for free.      Con:   I have to stay after school for 2 hours.   I cant play at games or tournaments.   I am dealing with bossy and stupid people (1/4 of the team)   I feel no pride in training with the team, and it will make me angry ever single time, if i see the volleyball team. (because i did not make the team)      Should i accept this offer or not?

20081104161830AAYyQtM	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Anyone know these 2 movies?	The first one is about a girl and boy, or something.

Well the white horse stopped right before they ran into this creek and he fell in. She thought he was just joking, and started laughing. But then she realized that he was dead, the mother got really upset of course and tried to shoot the horse. But thats all I remember about that one. It is a Hallmark movie.       The other one is about this lady who was either married to or wants to be married to this one guy, but she has an arranged marriage i think. So she has to go and live with that guy, they dont like each other at first. She finds out she's pregnant but I think that she thought it was the other guys baby, and I cant remember if it was or not lol. I dont remember much about that one, but it is a hallmark channel movie too.

20081114174442AAHB5Xy	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	What vocal part am I?	Alright, this is confusing me.  I sing bass 2 in choir, and that requires me to get down to about of E2, which is very difficult but I can do it, I just can't project it as loud as I want to which doesn't matter because most of the times it is piano.  I can really project an F2 though.  Anyways, today at Les Miserables practice Javert and Valjean weren't here so my friend and I took their parts.  I figured out I was able to go up to an A#4 which was one of the notes in the song.  I may be able to go higher, but it is pretty hard getting up to that A# in the first place.  It gets difficult for me around G.  And I'm not going flat or anything, I can project these in full voice with vibrato.  So my vocal range is about E2-A#4...what am I, a bass baritone?  I'm 15 years old btw.

20090219200236AAvpHDe	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The Last Dragon Remake?	Ok Im a huge fan of The Last Dragon. I have been watching this movie since I was 7 and im 19 right now. I found out like a few months ago that they are doin a remake for this movie. The Last Dragon is a cult classic movie produced by Berry Gordy in (1985). I really don't know if doin a remake for the movie a good idea or not, but either way its not goin to be easy to find the characters especially (Leroy Green) or even putting together the remake. But anyways I have come up with a few characters who would be really good for the roles of The Last Dragon Remake.      Leroy Green-I really don't have a clue who could play this guy. Im goin to really have to think about this because nobody really comes to mind when I think of Leroy Green.      Laura Charles-Megan Good, Keisha Cole, Christina Milian is a possibility, Beyonce wouldn't be a bad fit...      Eddie Arkadian-Danny Devito      Sho'nuff-Busta Rhymes or Samuel L. Jackson      Angela Viracco-I have no idea who could play for this character.      Richie Green-Bow Wow      Mama Green-Vivica A. Fox      Daddy Green-Maybe Laurence Fishburne      What do you think?      You can come up with your own list of characters for this movie.

20090219204349AAk0ib2	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What makes you unique?	( reading is optional )      If you own a cell phone -- then you are the same as a billion other people.   A laptop -- same as a billion other people.   A vehicle -- same!   live in a house -- same!   In or looking for love -- same!      Chances are, you are thinking about the same thing as someone else this very moment.   We all own the exact phone someone else owns.   We all own a device that someone else owns.   We all live, or have lived in a house that looks like someone else's.      Come to think of it..... that doesn't leave any room to brag about being unique.      That makes us more like every other creature, like birds who all build nest's that are similar, or spiders that all make similar webs, or beavers that all make similar dams.      Our social behaviors make us seem more like animals than our self conscious minds would like us to believe.      In fact, the likelihood of there being someone else just like you is higher than your comfort level can tolerate :P

Like, say there is a guy that responds to a question with a funny remark, he has three thumbs up.   The remark made you giggle slightly but it wasn't all that great, do you thumb up for the slight giggle or skip it knowing it got the funny-approval rating it deserved.   Conversely (or inversely?) There could be an answer that's not rude but doesn't really answer the question, it has two thumbs down. Do you thumb down or acknowledge he got the disapproval he should have and leave it at that?      Suggested category: Cultures & Groups > Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered

20090219193133AAHG5q2	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Have you seen the movie "The Wackness"?	Okay, I was always interested in it since I saw the trailer for it.   I thaught I would be able to relate with the main character (Josh Peck), a white kid who listens to rap music and has a hard time "getting laid". lol, (not funny).      So I'm watching this movie thinking I'd be impressed with the way the Hip-Hop music would be portreyed, but no. This kid claimed to be a Hip-Hop Head and he said, unlike the kids at school, he was loyal to he music giving his only evidence, "Man, I still listen to cassettes". Keep in mind that this movie took place in '94, WHEN THAT SAME OLDSCHOOL MUSIC WAS POPULAR and WHEN EVERYONE STILL LISTENED TO CASSETTES. He went to his classmates' parties,and everyone there was blasting Wu-Tang. The time and setting was really only applicable when Josh Peck went to see his "Jamacian" drug dealer Method Man, and he had some new tunes blasting in the room, and Josh says "Who's this?" and Method Man says "It's new sh-t. They call him Biggie." I was only impressed by Method Man's part.      As for the movie itself, it was about Josh Peck's troubles in life so he deals his drugs to a psychaitrist, who became his friend, in exchange for therapy sessions. So they always got high together and Josh ends up falling in love with the psycaitrist's step daughter, but she doesn't love him, she's just bored in the summer.      Then sh-t gets flipped a little bit and the movie just ends.      --I hope you've seen it, otherwise it just seems like I'm ranting.      But, the end of this movie kinda messed up my evening. It wasn't anything exciting, it just left questions in my head, and none of the characters were really "happy".      And what's the most dissapointing part of the movie, is that Josh Peck's character, the kid I thought I would be able to identify with, is a friggin' moron. He kinda just goes thru life. And as the audience member, we should able to see him acting more impulsively when he's not in public, like when he's in his room, he should be looking in a mirror or talking to himself to relect on his thoughts or his emotions. But, no, he just sits around in public, and lays around in private.      This was, without-a-doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Edward James Olmos as a childhood friend of Catherine(Marg Helgenberger), who was until recently a deputy director of the Nevada Department of  Public Safety(Division of Criminal INnestigation), who then gets named by evil LVMPD-Internal Affairs boss Conrad Ecklie to be the NEW head of the CSI lab...the rest of the CSIs don't appreciate Ecklie's interference, but quickly warm up to a calming "Grissom"-like influence of the new guy...teh ratings for "CSI:" then skyrocket, leading to more "CSI" spinoffs, like maybe set in Pasadena or Washington, DC...      Well, what do you think?...      Thanks!      P.S.:I'm not saying that Lawrence Fishburne is a bad actor(he's absolutely terrific, but in a more likable role as the Undersheriff of LVMPD), but we need a more familiar face, one who(like William Petersen) can easily transfer his experience from TV to movies and back in a wink of an eye!...and I think EJO fits the role perfectly!

20090219201514AAjxdJp	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Do you agree with me?! On the worst and best bands of all time?	Here's how my list looks (Just like probaly everyone else's)      Worst:   1. Pink Floyd   2. Nirvana    3. Led Zeppelin (Well their okay sometimes)      Best   1. Green Day!    2. Nickelback   3. Oasis         I believe Green Day is the best band of all time and it's an opinion that most people would agree on. "The American Idiot" CD is far THE BEST CD album of all time. "Wish You Were Here" was terrible and "The Wall" was bad too. And some songs by Zeppelin were overrated. Nirvana, I think most people would agree that their not great.          Now when we talk Nickelback we talk about the second best band of all time next to Green Day. Nickelback shows how they became a rockstar. Good song too. Let's face it, Zeppelin, Floyd and Nirvana just can't keep up with Nickelback and Green Day.       Sorry but this is my opinion and I know it's not a fact (Wish it was), but I just wish bands like Floyd can sound professional and classy like Green Day. "American Idiot" rules, best selling album ever!          Alright now. Who's with me on this one?!

Monday we went to lunch and then afterward went to his house and watched a movie and then he took me home. Nothing happened while we were at his house...we were just hanging out. Anyway, tonight we went to the movies and then he brought me home and walked me to my door. We kissed for a minute and then he said he'd call me later. Is it rude that I didn't invite him in?

Sometimes I get really stressed out about how I look, and I get really upset when I break out with acne. It's something I've been struggling with since I was fifteen years old, and it's begun to persist me to this day. I am 21 years old, and I seriously think I should have outgrown this by now. Ugh.       Anyway, I was looking at my natal chart and I have Venus in my first house under Aries, barely on a cusp between Pisces. They say that people born with Venus in the first house are generally good looking. I have the self-conscious of my apperance part, and I'm pretty charming and witty too; I was just wondering if it would say anything about my facial acne?       I mean, it's not like I have ALOT of acne. I've seen many people with far worse and i feel a little better about it sometimes, but still. This REALLY upsets me.       And no, I'm not a superficial person. I'm just concerned about my own looks and how I appear. I don't think it's a bad thing.

20090219223706AAq0huW	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Who did you vote for on American Idol Tuesday night?	Because the people that were picked, I am totally baffled about.   Danny I did think deserved to be up there. However, Michael and Alexis did not. Did you not hear them FLAT OUT say that they wanted the MONEY to give their families a better life? They don't care about singing or music. They are going to make one album to make enough money so they never have to work again and they will never make music again after that. Michael has a damn good job already so I don't know why he even brought up a money issue anyway.      Anoop and miss Tatiana should have been the other two in 3.   Yes, Tatiana is quite a mess, but look at how passionate she is about singing? She will do whatever it takes to be the best.   My point is American Idol is about someone who has strived so hard to get to the point of getting on american idol. This is their dream! It isn't fair that a person decides oh I can sing pretty good..hmmm...I think I should try out for American Idol so I can be rich and famous and get to sit on my lazy *** the rest of my life.
