Our current government is far too involved in everything, need a very open interpretation of the Constitution to make it fit.|`|534b588aabc2f9470b492f99f7d98b2baa	They certainly seem like bast ards to me.|`|tkoCbRfjaa	The countries are not illegitimate but US,UK and the EU are Zionist controlled non-democracies.    http://jewishracism.blogspot.com/
JufaTgT9aa	The economic collapse was caused primarily by four things:  1.  There was a natural recession beginning that made the economy vulerable to ...  2. people who were loaned money for houses when they really didn't have the means to pay off the loans.  Congress was responsible for this because they forced banks to loan the money despite their knowing it was not in anyone's best interest.  This was similar to the error congress made in the 1980's when they....  3.  Deregulating the banking industry which allowed them to operate with minimal oversight.  With regulation out the window, they....  4. Sold derivatives (which is the reason for the magnitude of the collapse).  The derivatives turned a drop in the housing market into a huge economic collapse because of what amounts to betting on people paying their loans.      I agree with a lot of what you're saying above.  Primarily, the president needs to stop talking about how much the economy is going to continue to implode.  A huge percentage of the health of an economy is what people believe will happen.  Continue to preach about a looming catatrophe only holds it down.  and yes, we hired a bunch of loons who can't get things done.  The nutty bill you're talking about has very little in it that will stimulate the economy.  It's mostly pork and entitlements with some job creation but only government jobs.|`|564611842b49f5e66f48b5de01e3b249aa	When it is the government that tells the banks who to loan to. The banks were mandated to make the sub prime loans by Federal judges and acts of congress. One should note Obama your president himself was involved in such cases which has broke the banks and all that bought stock in them and countries that loaned to them. The banks knew who to make loans to as they had their point systems, but were told to make these sub prime loans. The promoters of these ideas hoped to off set the losses from these loans from higher interest on the good loans in other words make prudent society pay for imprudent life styles of others. So it appears that savings of the prudent of the world over has been squandered on the life styles of the imprudent in this country. The fact is the life styles of the imprudent is greater at this point than the ability of the prudent to save so till we go back to good laws of banking and stop this redistribution of wealth we are all going to be broke and headed toward homelessness.|`|lr74sHPLaa	agreed, but alot of them still have their jobs, just look at congress' pathetic a$$es with their 9% and falling approval rating.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	yes its been going on since 1933|`|AA10329269	Uh oh - you missed the point. It is very confusing, since they are calling the bill a "stimulus" package. You have to catch up on your NewSpeak - "stimulus" now means welfare. "Fixing the economy" now refers to creating economic fairness.|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Dems take both Houses, gas prices jump, transportation costs jump, gas prices rise, food prices rise, people eat, gas prices spike, food prices rise dramtically, people forgo paying on loans they could barely afford, Dems tighten bankruptcy laws, people default on loans, banks pay the price for being forced by Dems to give sub-prime loans, economy fails, businesses fail, housing market fails, Dems blame Bush, Obama is elected, economy gets markedly worse, unemployment rises (to 500 million a month,evidently) ... Dems blame Bush    I think I see a pattern here...|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The current crisis is a direct result of political interference in the residential mortgage market.  Politicians told mortgage lenders they had to make more money available to lower-income people.  And those instructions stayed in place during a bubble that saw housing prices rise dramatically.  The only way many of the borrowers could repay their loans was to wait for prices to rise further, sell their houses, and then buy a less expensive home.    For all the whining about the speculators who drove oil prices through the roof last summer, our politicians turned many of our economically disadvantaged citizens into real estate speculators.      Barney Frank and his colleagues dont know the difference between a mortgage and a mountain.  Yet they were charged with regulating and overseeing the mortgage industry.  Now we are expecting them to fix the problem!  Those idiots fixed us, big time.    How can we have any confidence in our government and its institutions?  The heads of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were cooking the books and paying themselves millions, but Barney Frank and others blocked stricter regulation of those companies. The SEC was warned several times about the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme, but ignored it.      Our mortgage lenders were pushed into making zero-down loans to sub-prime borrowers, and many of them had negative amortization loans so they didnt even have to pay the full interest on their loans.  Now our politicians are talking about predatory lenders as they condemn mortgage lenders who only did what they were ordered to do.    Call your bank, or any bank, and ask to speak to someone in their Sub-Prime Mortgage Division.  They dont have such divisions!  Banks do not deliberately make potentially bad loans.      Our politicians created this mess and their solution is going to make it worse.  Many of them are telling mortgage holders to write down their loans, reduce their interest rates, and extend the mortgages to 40 years so people can keep their homes.  But those are not their homes.  Theyre the banks homes, and they will be until the mortgage loans are paid off.      Many liberals are still talking about the cost of the war in Iraq.  They dont seem to have anything to say about the $12 trillion dollars people have lost in their home values, IRAs and 401k accounts.  Our politicians are corrupt and stupid.  They steal our money to buy our votes.  Allowing them to regulate or legislate for the good of the people is like allowing a fox to guard a chicken coop.      Whats next?  Is the government going to try to reduce Social Security benefits so they dont have to reduce welfare benefits for young, healthy people who are quite capable of working but choose not to?    With more than 40 million baby boomers on the brink of retirement, do they think they are going to get away with that?  NO!!!!!|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	i agree 100%! The media is totally ignoring that 'little fact".    The same politicians who failed to monitor the banks finances DURING the housing debackal, are the ones demanding more "stimulus" spending!|`|YbXSNgUOaa	When gas cos. raised the price of gasoline, that started the mess.|`|45u7BzCUaa	They're not ding dongs.

It's a disease affecting Washington which ALL Americans are the doctors, the only one's who can provide a cure.  Even Obama is showing some shady-ness.  It's quite disgusting to see all of this corruption all at once.  It was bound to come out but ALL at once will hopefully upset the American people enough to maybe make some changes.  Or it could be more of the same.    Gas prices started the snow ball affect.  The housing market collapse was the icing on the cake.|`|vLIVOxhGaa	Because our country is run by liberals - and even most Republicans now are liberal enough to be Democrats - we are in a huge mess.  And because these liberals have the power to grow government, etc., the mess isn't going to get any bigger anytime soon.    The problem is that they ARE trying to grow government, and they know exactly how to do it.      I want to know why banks or any other businesses are too big to fail?  If I start a business and I make poor decisions and I lose all my money - that's all on ME.  That's my fault - not yours, not the government's, and not anyone else's.  So, this may sound mean and I'm sorry, but let them fail.  They made mistakes, they made poor decisions, whatever...there are consequences for any decision you make or action you take.      And, like you said, if the businesses that are "too big to fail" failed, that would provide opportunities for other people, or even for those in that business, to start over and do even better.  That's the beauty of capitalism.    But because the U.S. is swiftly becoming socialist, the government has to control ever little aspect of our lives and tell us what we can and cannot do and how to spend our money, etc. etc. etc.      Lovely, isn't it?

Their politicizing and impeding the passage of stimulus plan will destroy this great country.    Government need to spend on public projects to restart the dying economy. The economy will not "correct" itself, as a whacko called Friedman said. Look at Iceland, which modelled its economy after Friedman's ideology. Did it correct itself? Their economy collapsed folks!    This is not just an ordinary recession, as many prominent economists like Bernanke and Krugman already pointed out. A lot of the once established banks are in trouble and one, the Lehman Brothers, is history. We are on uncharted waters, and like it or not, the economy will not correct itself. Like a person who is in ER, you think about the life of your loved one.

In 1991 I used to go from the outskirts of Moscow to the city centre to buy some milk for my son. It was a collapse of domestic industry and growing imports. Nobody expected that. Some people in the highest administration of the communist party got mad or committed suicide because they couldn't admit that socialism had failed.     But on the other hand Gorbachev and some other modernized commies were interested in those changes because without private property law they couldn't secure considerable assets, that they controlled. In the classical soviet regime there were competing clans and no private property.|`|8TZzjGsnaa	We are the Soviet Union now.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Everything in the Soviet Economy was subsidized and/or produced by the state. That is the short simple answer. The transition economy allowed for goods to rise to the actual value of them based on supply and demand.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	Gorbachev was moving the soviet union through a smooth transition towards openness and an effective market economy.

Just like Nazi germany|`|78viUyfdaa	they tried to solve there money problem by printing more money decresing its value and rising inflation.|`|elfwfHAWaa	I would disagree that they printed money after collapse. The inflation was caused by more than half century of regulated centralistic economy. Price was set not by supply/demand, not by manufacturer, but by central planning bureau. Just, like if some office in Washington would say that price of i roll of toilet paper is 55c. And you must sell for this price, everywhere, from alaska to hawaii, in every shop. If the price is low, you end up with undersupply, with queues in front of shops. There is no competition, because you may not start your own toilet paper factory, and even if you would, you price would have to be 55c, and profit would go to state. It's like if taxes would be 100% and politicians would subsidy what they thing people want.

But are there other witnesses?  Also, kids of that age can rarely lie for long under pressure like that. Even if the boy sticks to his story, most likely one of his friends will give him up.  The police know how to get people to talk and it's very easy with kids.|`|om9PLGecaa	fuk him   they wont do ****   if that happened to my lil girl i would of beat the lil mouthy **** who threw it    even if they do have him charged with assault on the girl and harassment, there soon drop the charges|`|vl0HWTDJaa	If he cut her face then it's actually the most serious (non-sexual) assault you can commit - s18 Offences Against the Persons Act (GBH). If all you did is touch him, not injure him, then it's only enough to be common assault, which will usually get a v low sentence but in this case, because you did it directly after he hurt the girl, you can claim self-defence. It doesn't actually have to be SELF defence, you're allowed to be defending any other person, so there's realistically no chance that you're ever going to be charged and especially convicted.    Because there were witnesses he's got a good chance of being charged if you make a complaint about him but think about the consequences before you do anything - are his parents going to believe his side and get enraged that you're accusing their son, because that could lead to stronger charges against you.    Post update: Sorry about them charging you, I still think you could have rejected the caution and claimed self defense in court successfully but I can understand if you didn't want to let it go that far.    Now that the case against you has been settled, it makes it easier for you to press charges against him without it affecting your case. You could also speak to the police about getting restraining or non-harassment orders against the mother who has been threatening people but again, doing these things practically could aggravate the situation so you need to decide if it's worth it.|`|d0014395a247a4b257cc8f1d64dc701aaa	Newspapers like the Daily Mail really love stories like this.

I would also make a complaint to the police as at 13 he is criminally responsible and he assaulted the little one causing actual bodily harm.    A counter claim shout get his little brown hole twitching and he will be shaking like a shi**ing dog, he will soon come out with the truth.    you know what they say 'feed a bird enough TRILL (bird seed) and it will sing' translated 'grilled for long enough by the police and the truth will come out'

With food stamps the government helps create the largest possible market for American grown food.  That's why funding for the program is always done in the Farm bills.  That's why the program is governed by the USDA.  That's why the modern program was developed by people like Republican Bob Dole (from farm state Kansas).  And that's why it will never, ever go away.  The farm lobby supports it bigtime.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	We give people food because they need it.

In some places he would get 6 months, in other's life in prison, and in some countries, death.  and everywhere in between.|`|1khSdbWSaa	i would say if they could evidence to how badly he raped her he could be looking at 9-12 years|`|Zn7NNavKaa	it depends on a few things. number 1 look up the laws in your state, they vary. number two can he afford a paid laywer or will he use a public defender?  once he is arrainged they could offer him a plea aggreement where he will plead guilty to A LESSER CRIME THEREFOR GETTING A LESSER SENTENCE.  it also depends on the da and judge. hopefully in your state there is a mandatory sentence and they won't offer him a plea  good luck i hope he gets the max!
EOZ8OdK0aa	Like any third world/developing nation--horrible.  The "western" frontier is splintered with many groups pledging allegiance to Al Quaida.  While the rest of Pakistan is more liberal.  However, the government and military are split on what to do with that group.  They don't want the US or anyone else really helping in eliminating them thereby making it difficult for the US efforts in Afghanistan.  The government overall has been somewhat stable since Musharaff was booted from office.  The big scare however, is that Pakistan does have nuclear capabilities.  They DON'T like India.  It's really just a volitile situation.  The US walks carefully fully understanding they can neither lose the support of Pakistan, nor "piss" them off.|`|LckaooJpaa	see: FUBAR.|`|jbE1nWqzaa	Its becoming another Afghanistan.
rHwE5Rkbaa	You have a good base of THC in your system from your regular use of pot.  Your THC levels may well be high enough to be detected by the military tests.    If you pop positive - the Coast Guard won't let you sit back for six months and then test again... you are out.  You can wait six months and then try for one of the other services, because we won't take you.    If you are lucky enough to no pop positive, I have a recommendation for you.

t3A9qpQIaa	You have good answers here.  I would go with having them ready at the door.  Your sister needs a good attorney right now.  She needs a restraining order right now.  It can be done overnight and she can do it herself if her lawyer doesn't.  Go to clerk of the court and get the paper, fill it out and file.  Get the sheriff to serve.  She has police record to prove if necessary.  Do it ASAP as she IS in peril of social services intervening.  It's only going to get worse.  You get a restraining order for yourself too.  He is dangerous and not afraid of the law.  (legal term = scofflaw}  Both go together would be good.  If you have to go before the judge; do so.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	all i can say is you both need to contact the police when you have an encounter with this man. get a restraining order. get a security system installed for emergencies.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	If you refuse to give him his kids, you ARE guilty of kidnapping.  He has a legal right to pick his kids up for his legal visitation or custody.    You are going to get yourself AND your sister in a lot of trouble.  Stay out of it and mind your own business.  Your interference is causing a lot of stress that is NOT helping the kids.     If you don't want him coming to your house, you need to tell your sister to place the kids in a proper daycare.|`|AA10023092	Actually quizzard and the police are both right.  You can deny him access to your house but you still can't deny him access to his children.  Two seperate issues.  So yeah keep him in the house, and call the police when he comes.  Guess who the kids will be leaving with.
UoGFo3Dhaa	Do your own homework.    Democracy gives all the voice.  51% win.  49% loose.    It is called mob rule.  The mob vote and the majority wins.    If most of the mob were stoners.  They would vote 51% or more to sit around and smoke pot all day.  The 49% or less that knew you had to work all day or not eat would loose.  No work would get done.  Society would fail.

We DID liberate Iraq, whether we were greeted or not. And the Iraqi people are overwhelmingly grateful that we did so. These are uncontrovertable facts.    And, to be truthful, the reason we were not greeting quite so openly is because people feared greatly for their own safety if they did so, because they were aware of the violence their fellow Iraqis were capable of.|`|JCxE0mq9aa	No way.

It seems the only people who likely won't get a bailout are the everyday folks who lost jobs through no fault of their own?    Meanwhile those who maintain their jobs will have to pay more taxes to cover all the bailouts.
3MM64geHaa	IT would shrink the welfare roles. People are nto going to do charity work for govt funds.  They would cry slavery is back.|`|coFWlptOaa	I would prefer them to get a job.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	Please tell me the statistics on how many people are currently on welfare. And how difficult is it to get on it.|`|VIK4jt0Oaa	They are on welfare for a reason. They are either psychological unstable making them extremely irresponsible and unreliable. I think they would cause more problems than be any help.     I've been a position to hire some of these people and let me tell you, when you have deadlines and responsibilities to meet as a supervisor; these issues only get in your way.     Sorting Mail: They would probably send your mail to Alaska and Hawaii (assuming you live on the mainland)    Make Uniforms, cut grass: They would probably claim some injury then live off workers compensation ultimately end up costing you and I 4 fold of what welfare pays them now.    Looking at the logistics: Just pay them to stay home, it's cheaper for all of us tax payers (and I PAY alot of taxes,).    We could be just like Korea and let them all starve.|`|YTJ5Upneaa	This has been tried before, but the welfare recipients were upset because the jobs they were required to do were "demeaning". I'm sorry but I have done alot of "demeaning" jobs as a way of making a paycheck, so that I did not have to go on welfare. Why should they be allowed to sit home and collect a check for doing nothing? There is no job that is demeaning, if it gives you a paycheck.|`|LNFg5KMuaa	I'm a disabled vet.  Not 100% but a decent amount.  I didn't apply for it, they just evaluated my injury and came up with a percentage.  I said that I didn't want a handout and they told me they had to give me something for "vulnerability to lawsuit reasons".  They said it wasn't a handout program but a compensation program, just like when you get injured in a car accident.  I still work and am about to go to college.  I think anyone that accepts a handout from government should be subject to government rules and regulations, but we need to make sure people don't get labeled as getting welfare that really just have legitamate damage claims against the government.  Not saying the VA system is perfect but it is what it is.|`|fbf036d0bcf69547cc9d92e1f54de8d8aa	WHAT----WHAT---WHAT??? Are you suggesting SLAVERY!!!!???? How dare you! Look here, America STILL owes me for enslaving my forefathers. That debt will never be paid!    (Educated people will recognize the foregoing as sarcasm.)    Speaking of education, there's an old saying; "You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink". And so it goes with education. Those that do not want to learn, can't be made to learn.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	I think anyone that is a net "taker" and not a net "maker" should do whatever is required of them to keep taking. We don't require enough of the non-achievers in our society.|`|isbGvDRZaa	Yeah, especially the ones accepting trillion-dollar corporate welfare.|`|vLIVOxhGaa	No, we should kill welfare and have people support themselves rather than making hard-working citizens support them against our will.|`|d5RbVpnRaa	Good idea, however your asking them to work, the thing is they don't really want to work. Here's another thought, I work with some people who have a great job and do not want to work, and we are mostly Unionized (I'm not going to mention where I work but it has 10 letters and starts with the big "G"), and when they don't want to do something, they mess it up thoroughly, and believe me they waste more time and effort not working. We are better off not having them sorting mail, the uniforms would not fit, the grass would look terrible, and they would run over the landscaping, and in the end you will spend more fixing the screw ups. I know that this sounds dark, but I see it all the time.|`|CYN6eVTaaa	Absolutely not. I do not think this proposed resolution should be made mandatory to welfare recipients. I think there should be type of (possibly minute) benefit to those who do federal charity work, but it should not be made mandatory.     We either help them - no strings attached - or we don't, period.     What many people often times overlook is that most welfare recipients work ALOT. Many work horrendous hours and at multiple jobs, but it still is not enough to make ends meet; this is where the government steps in the form of welfare. And...It sounds to me, when reading this proposition presented before us, that the primary concern here is that welfare recipients don't work; they don't "get up off their asses". Well, if that is the motive of this proposition (re: charity work) you are not incorrect..., but dead wrong. As I just said, they do work. They work a lot, but with primitive education, usually bad background, etc. all they can get are minimum waged jobs. Why do you think there are SOOOO many ADULTS working minimum waged jobs? Minimum waged jobs, in the past, have always been worked by teenagers - the younger generation. This is not the case anymore adults have breached into this realm and they have done so because of the reasons I have listed above.     In conclusion, the last thing we want to do is give them **** to do, haha - come on. The undernoted indirect issue here is not charity work, it is: "How do we get these 'people' on welfare to provide some sort of compensation to the American taxpayers, etc." and, to a large extent, "how do we ultimately get them off of welfare"    Answer: Education;  Charity work is not the answer to this growing problem...its education and it's a healthy organized economy (but mostly a firm, healthy education). Now ...how we answer the question of education is an entirely different matter...but it must be done to solve the welfare crisis.|`|AA11166769	On the one hand, it doesn't sound like such a bad idea. On the other hand, when would they have time to look for a job or go to school?|`|4SLjJvcqaa	yes|`|FX4WhQtKaa	no...because then they would put people that want to work out of a job........it promotes laziness as a way to get a job......think about it ..all you have to do to get a job is be lazy?......there are not enough jobs out there let the lazy stay home and give the people that want to work go to work....it's the only solution.....until there are jobs ,.do not put the welfare to work.....|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	sounds fair enough    but please, not that welfar to work bs, we all saw the skills provided by this service providers... and all took the blame for a few slugs...|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Well, wouldn't that mean that people that get paid to do that work would become unemployed because the gov't is getting that labor for free?    I get your premise and it's not a bad one but if that was to be implemented, it would have to be for volunteer work that is already open.  Such as volunteering at a hospital or for Habitat for Humanity or something along those lines.|`|u23sBafTaa	Im not sure the ones around here could work it in with there court dates.  It's hard to evade the police when you show up to work too.  They would be waiting with the warrants!  They would never go for that !|`|AA11103371	Not a bad idea at all.  National service is a great thing.  Ask not what your country can do for you....
yvPA8FSsaa	What you do not understand is that the Democrats have been lying to you.  Most of America bought what was being sold in the campaign but now that they see it  they are running away in droves.  Sure, people want the Government do take action to stimulate the economy but now that they see what the Democrats actually intend to do, only 37% support it.    The Democrats and Obama do not need any Republicans to pass this bill.  So why are they so desperate to get them on board?  Because this is a disastrous waste of money and they know it!  If they are forced to be the only Party supporting it and the economy does not recover there will only be them to blame.    Trust me and your own common sense.  If it had any chance of improving the economy, they would not be seeking Republican support but anxiously passing it so they could get all the credit.    What are you going to believe?  What you are being told or your own eyes?  Do you know what the Republicans have threatened to do if they are not allowed to seriously modify this bill?  They have threatened to read it on the floor of the Senate.  The last thing the Democrats can afford to have happen is to have anyone hear what is actually in this bill rather than what they are telling you is in this bill.    *|`|AA11847612	CHANGE!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Who are these silly naive people who really thought there were would radical change?

Sorry you bought it. He is pandering to republicans because he wants bipartisan support for this stimulus package. All of the house republicans voted against it. Now it is in the senate and republicans are not going to support it as it originally was because it is a pork laden democratic wish list.  Republicans also want more tax cuts for you. He wants bipartisan support in case this stimulus turns out to be nothing but wasteful spending and causes a worsening of the economy. That way democrats are not the only ones to blame. Also,  the majority of the country is not in favor of this stimulus bill. Believe me, republicans are not going to vote for him. Although I did not vote for him, I was all about giving Obama a chance once he won. He lost me with the nominations of tax evaders, Tom Daschle and Tim Geithner and an executive order that funds abortions overseas while we are in economic crisis. Change, yey! Also, even before he won the election, Obama stated that he would appoint Republicans to cabinet positions and seek bipartisain support. So his actions should not be news to anyone.|`|45u7BzCUaa	To have too much of one side is dangerous.

Just so you don't think I'm picking on Democrats. Republicans aren't doing much better. Congress has an approval rating of less than 10%. But few of the people who ran for re-election were defeated, that includes both Republicans or Democrats.     Obama did run on change. But it's like hiring a new coach for a losing team. The best coach in the world can't make winners out of people with no talent.    Obama tried to hire more Democrats but he quickly found out they couldn't fill out a tax return.|`|kDxljPUnaa	The wheels are already stating to fall off of his administration and he's going to need all the help he can get.     Unfortunately the republicans will bend and sway to Obama. It's only natural to give a sitting president the benefit of the doubt. But despite the fact that the democrat majorities do not need the republicans to pass any legislation, the president will still need bipartisan support to at least appear to be in control.     Obama is first and foremost a politician. And he has to remember that nearly half of the people did NOT vote for him. Hard to get re-elected that way. Especially when he's losing so much support from his base as you have clearly vocalized.

There is nothing to stop him from saying "If you get any funding from the US government, you are capped at $500,000."    So all University professors should be capped.    Then, he can say "if you get tax breaks from the government, you are capped at $500,000."  Everybody is forced by law to pay taxes.  So, if you get a tax break, Obama can cap your salary.

Watch, we're gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy."    "I can give you at least four or five scenarios from where it might originate," Biden said to Emerald City supporters, mentioning the Middle East and Russia as possibilities. "And he's gonna need help. And the kind of help he's gonna need is, he's gonna need you - not financially to help him - we're gonna need you to use your influence, your influence within the community, to stand with him.

When the next terrorist attack hits this country during Obamas tenure....please try not to b***h and moan too much when we say:    We told you so.      Shortly after the first Gulf War in 1991, U.N. inspectors discovered the existence of a surprisingly advanced Iraqi nuclear weapons program. In addition, by Iraq's own admission and U.N. inspection efforts, Saddam's regime possessed thousands of chemical weapons and tons of chemical weapon agents. Were it not for the 1995 defection of senior Iraqi officials, the U.N. would never have made the further discovery that Iraq had manufactured and equipped weapons with the deadly chemical nerve agent VX and had an extensive biological warfare program.  Here is what was known by 1998 based on Iraq's own admissions:  * That in the years immediately prior to the first Gulf War, Iraq produced at least 3.9 tons of VX, a deadly nerve gas, and acquired 805 tons of precursor ingredients for the production of more VX.  * That Iraq had produced or imported some 4,000 tons of ingredients to produce other types of poison gas.  * That Iraq had produced 8,500 liters of anthrax.  * That Iraq had produced 500 bombs fitted with parachutes for the purpose of delivering poison gas or germ payloads.  * That Iraq had produced 550 artillery shells filled with mustard gas.  * That Iraq had produced or imported 107,500 casings for chemical weapons.  * That Iraq had produced at least 157 aerial bombs filled with germ agents.  * That Iraq had produced 25 missile warheads containing germ agents (anthrax, aflatoxin, and botulinum).  Again, this list of weapons of mass destruction is not what the Iraqi government was suspected of producing. (That would be a longer list, including an Iraqi nuclear program that the German intelligence service had concluded in 2001 might produce a bomb within three years.) It was what the Iraqis admitted producing. And it is this list of weapons--not any CIA analysis under either the Clinton or Bush administrations--that has been at the heart of the Iraq crisis.      What part of Kill The Infidels did you not understand?  Complacency invites terrorism to our country.|`|HFiQDtsPaa	NO, you IDIOTA!

Everyone else needs to pay attention, and demand a return to sane economic policies and the restoration of our civil rights
fUFf7GQ2aa	How about unfairly targeted American taxpayers who are FORCED to pay for these illegals education. I mean we have to pay for our kids, and then we should pay for theirs too, and they aren't even supposed to be here.     I'll have to remember that line "it's not the student committing the crime it's the employer" next time a traffic cop pulls me over.  I'll tell him "It's not me speeding, it's the car" and we'll see how fast I get ticketed.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Wow, the illegals are either lying or really are that ignorant!

Even with e-verify.  We abide by the law and fill out the I-9.  From that point it is "supposed" to be up to INS/ICE to follow up on the docs filed.  We know they do not.  We do not knowingly hire illegals either.  The illegals who come in and fill out the paperwork for the employment know full well, whether they are here illegally or not and whether their real name is Juan or Pepe.  Citizens are told, ignorance of the law is no excuse, why is it an excuse for the illegals?  If they are here illegally, deport them, end of story.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	that depends on how you interpret the law.  liberals interpret it as illegals are innocent.  in their world the system is flawed, the bad guy is oppressed!|`|G4TJ8nibaa	I say deport their sorry @sses back where they belong and we won't have to worry about it!

AA11963685	He is pro-choice.  He wants to work to reduce the number of abortions performed in this country through effective education instead of using the abysmal failure of abstinence only programs.  He believes that partial birth abortion should only be performed when the mother's physical life is in real danger.  He refused to sign the bill put forth in Illinois protecting fetuses born alive not because he thinks they should die but because there was already a bill protecting them and the new bill was nothing but an attempt by pro-lifers to get language put through that might lead to challenging Roe v Wade.  Smart guy not to fall for their obvious sneakiness.  But of course they ignore the real reason and try to claim he wants dead babies.  They are despicable people in my opinion.    EDIT:  I'm always bemused by people who object to the rare instance of a woman needing an abortion to save her life.  I often wonder if their sister was pregnant and the doctor's said she would die if they didn't terminate how they would really react.  She can have more children, but they can only bury their sister once.  What's up with people who would make a choice to let her die?  That's revolting.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Nobody is "for" abortions...its "PRO-CHOICE".  There is a HUGE difference...so, pick up a book and learn.|`|cR1M8ALyaa	He's for the woman's right to choose.

Not sure why I am getting thumbs down...that is a fact.|`|iNQK27Qqaa	Actually he is, and yes he is a big pusher of the Partial Birth Abortion which is pretty much murder. That what he want to do with part of his """"""stimulus""""""" package, and your money|`|AzwqJ6Hdaa	He's for abortion. Didn't you hear him say that if his daughter's were to get pregnant,he wouldn't want them "PUNISH" with a baby.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	I'm for mandatory abortion. Think about people! Who would want to end up having a deformed,disabled,disfigured,diseased ridden child and end up having to put that person on 70-80 years worth of life support. The last time i checked on it, we humans have 6.8 billion of us on this dear Earth as it stands today. And with both China & India each having over a billion people and are trying to increase the standard of living,makes u wonder whether we're headed for disaster or not!
G6yyceAxaa	there is a lot of truth in what your saying.    this crap started years ago with the Reagan "trickle down" economic theory.  then he "fixed" social security by doing the following:    increasing the retirement age from 65 to 72.  reducing the amount of money that future generations can collect  placing a cap on the amount that can be put into social security (so the rich don't have to put but a one time amount of 200,000 for the lifetime benefits)    along comes Dubbya, and he says "let the free market rule" and it has, right down the toilet.    then he says, cut the taxes of the wealthy, and they will re-invest in the market and everything will fix itself, It didn't    Republicans basically want to try the same stuff again.  problem is this    the definition of crazy is to try the same thing over and over and expect it to have a different result.    now we have a president that has been in office all of 3 weeks, and suddenly every since from the Civil War is his fault.  the Stimulus package is still in the senate, but naysayers are already saying that it won't work.  wake up people, let at least try something different, and if it doesn't work, let's try something else.|`|AA12089018	So the Republicans personally ran the mortgage industry, all the car companies, all the industrial jobs?    Wow, go to your local news channel and tell them because the american people want to know what facts you have.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Hey Paul.  How bout putting your money where your mouth is.

Seems to me that things were going great until the midterm elections when the Dems gained control.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Throwing money at problems is always the dems answer to everything. The economy will fix it self. Obama leave it alone! The mess we are in is a result of deadbeats and losers taking out mortgages they should of never received.

"  LOL...Sounds like you're looking for a good excuse and safe escape for Obama already, and he's only been in office 2 weeks. The economic mess that we're in , i.e the mortgage situation, started more than 8 years ago.  Bush surely didn't do much to improve the situation but the blame doesn't completely fall on him. Bill "i didn't inhale" Clinton did no regulating of the economy either...it just took awhile after Reagan to fall down.    But I'm guessing you wouldn't anything from remember that long ago.|`|e2bb5ba263e7ef55a1ceccb9a2d3bb96aa	First of all, John McCain is a RINO.  Secondly, we can thank the Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, administrations for starting us down the path of loaning money to people for houses who we knew, could not pay it back; to Chris Dodd and Barney Frank for putting this entire process into warp drive; and to a bunch of other spineless RINOs for standing by and allowing it all to happen.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Paul:    Stop getting your news from CNN and the Huffington Post! This country has already gone down the tubes and Obama and the Dem's are flushing it further down.    As to who is to blame, those who see the bigger picture know that social engineering by the liberals in this country has caused this mess. When the Fed's tell banks to lend to everyone who has a pulse and that the banks will be bailed out for any bad loans, the result is what we have now.    If all of you would just let the free market system work unfettered, we could return to a strong economy. But I have little hope that you will do so as it would result in an unequal result (some winners and some losers).    Get your hands off the controls and the plane will return to level flight - I promise!|`|fkWT0CS1aa	Please get your facts straight. It was in fact the Democrats, Dodd, Paulson, Pelosi and that loud mouth Barney Frank that caused the collapse of the housing market. They allowed those ridiculous sub prime loans to be given out to millions of home buyers who could in no way, shape or form purchase those homes with a conventional mortgage! These people did not belong buying such an expensive house just for satus quo! Allowing homebuyers to mortgage 105% on homes they had no business even looking at, non the the less purchasing.  As an experienced licensed Real Estate Agent, I saw many,many outrageous mortgages being approved during the housing boom.   These loans were allowed because of the kick backs given to the demorcats for pushing this type of financing on the American people. Then they decided to blame President Bush for laws he did not endorse or want, just because it was an election year and they wanted to make sure they had the majority party in the White House to create more debt for the Amercian people. Democrats at it's best..TAX AND SPEND with no regard for how we, the tax payers are going to be affected by all the pork and bull they are pushing on us!|`|N8BbxwrGaa	First off , What your referring to is really Clinton's mess- It takes about 8 years for the full impact of the former president to manifest- especially our financial mess- Ever heard the term Clintonomics, that's what we are going through now. If I do recall the direct actions of him and his wife and friends resulted in major banks collapse, wonder what else they did that we are enjoying now, seems they set a precedent and a rule book for banks and lending organizations to behave like fools.    I am disgusted that someone who we are supposed to trust with our taxpayer dollars has already hired 2 tax evaders, then we get an apology! "..... oh I am sorry I got caught.... I didn't inhale..."    History repeats itself over and over and over, basically Democrats are big talking, money grabing liars,(Clinton, Kennedy, and now obama)|`|AA11847612	Yeah, it's a shame that there were no Democrats in Congress the past eight years. In fact, I bet if they were in control for only the past TWO years, then things would really be different!|`|otYOxmnuaa	Wrong -- nice try though.      Follow the money -- I'll give you a hint.  Barney Frank and company.    Not to say the Repubs don't share some of the blame -- or the banks -- or the consumers.      But if we are to be objective -- democrats played a big role as well.    Attempted regulation by Repubs -    Directly from the Donkey's mouths:  2001/2002:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPSDnGMzI...    2004:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4A0RuXhn...  ======================================...  "Wow! Did you folks forget that it was the Republicans who passed the "Hedge Fund" acts that led to this mess when they controlled Congress? Or that it was the Republican Controlled Congress that rejected John McCains legislation that demanded some oversight in the home lending programs?????????"    First off -- Republicans did have the majority but not enough representative to shotgun legislation as Democrats do now in the House.  Democrats unanimously shot down regulation of Fannie/Freddy.  In addition, in order for Hedge Fund "derugulation" (as you call it) to pass, some democrats had to be on board.        Secondly, absent Fannie/Freddy allowing banks a market to securitize these loans, Hedge Funds wouldn't have access to as many "bundled securities" as they did.  Some would call this a Causal Relationship:    Cause -- CRA opened securitization market through Fannie/Freddy allowing millions of reckless loans and subsequent bundled/packaged loans for purchase.    Effect -- In an attempt to diversify their portfolios, Hedge Funds found refuge in bundled mortgages -- which at the time, offered a good return even though they were slightly risky.  Hedge Funds always found refuge in bundled mortgages -- but surely not in the volume between 2002-2007.  That doesn't mean they fueled the practice of loaning "failed" loans.  That was clearly at the hands of CRA and Fannie/Freddy's ability to buy these crappy loans.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Only the misinformed believe Bush 43 and the Republicans were the cause of our recession.|`|qq804CE8aa	Oh please, reread your history.

Is it the housing crisis which has its roots in the CRA of 1978? Who caused that problem?

And if Obama's stimulus plan passes and ends up being a disaster - what will you say to that? It goes both ways.|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	Tell it to Dems Barney Frank and Chris "Sweetheart of Countrywide Mortgage" Dodd.  They were told to put curbs in and ignored it.    The answer to being in a hole is not to spend your way out of it.    Let's say you have $10,000 in credit card debt.  Do you spend more to get out of that debt, or try to pay it off?
AA12181502	The Waffen SS had very strict guidelines on who joined, you had to be able to prove Aryan Lineage for at least 5 generations. There were strict height and weight requirements.  The criteria was so strict to begin with that you could not join if you had any of your teeth filled!    As germany began to occupy other countries in europe they decide that they would try to recruit men of fighting age.  Since the German constitution forbids non German nationals from joining the Wehrmacht it was decided to induct them into the SS.    This gave birth to hitlers "foreign legions"  the included units from scandanavia SS Wiking, France, Belgium,Croatia and of course the Infamous Britische Freikorps, to name but a few.  This is where both the Fuhrer and Himmler'sAryan ideal became somewhat diluted  You had the Handschar  Division made up of Bosnian muslims, (slavs were considered "untermensch" sub human and therefore not Aryan) There is even evidence of SS insignia that had been made for Indian units although this is generally regarded as a propaganda tool.    So to begin with yes in the end when manpower became a premium I'm afraid they couldn't be that picky!      Dear me wolfie so quick to judge, perhaps you should read more and i'm not on about the socialist worker either!  To give a quote from one of the above books "when asked why i joined the SS it was simple I wanted to be aprt of an elite formation"    So love them or hate them, from a soldiers perspective the were a formidable fighting force that engendered an excellent example of esprit de corps!|`|UAwyRPyyaa	Be carefull rb. You could be talking positive discrimination here, and we all know you don,t exactly favour that.|`|mrI8mfFpaa	WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE ARYANS???

Officers in the SS were supposed to be able to prove their bloodline was 'pure' right back to 1750. When the SS started it was very small and was only really Hitler's bodyguard, after the 1934 night of long knives was when it started to become more significant.|`|f1089850a846b23897ab7334750e8ad0aa	I had a friend who had been an SS guard at Auswitzch.  He was quite a nice guy - died in the late '80's  He told me stories that conflict a lot with the junk written by todays left wing, politically correct, semi educated and semi literate idiots.  i.e. so called journalists.  We have all been indoctrinated since the late '40's and the result is the watered down, weak, ineffective country we call England today.  Toadying up to the US, under the thrall of loud mouthed stupid mis guided women, Godless, disarmed, emasculated.  England has a hard time coming and all because English men would not stand up for their rights and freedoms.|`|902xLI8kaa	no it was not if you look at any photo of the ss most had black or brown hair|`|tkoCbRfjaa	Marc D is correct. Hitler himself had Jewish blood  and Adolf Eichmann and  Reinhard Heydrich, Himmler's second in command of the SS organization were both full blood Jewish.     As pointed out in  "Bryan Mark Riggs's: Book Hitler's Jewish Soldiers" there were many Jews and part Jews throughout the Nazi regime even at the highest levels including  field  marshal Erhard Milch a senior figure in the airforce...    Some have argued that Nazism was really a  form of Talmudic supremacist teaching  applied German Aryanism and a form of controlled opposition  to Bolshevikism which in itself is  Talmudic and was backed by bankers.    The vast majority of both Communism's and Nazism's victims were Christian including the German people themselves.  Churchill too was Jewish on his mother's side and it was he who escalated the bombing war on civilians after he took power.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	The SS started out as Hitler's personal bodyguard.  Hitler wanted a group of troops personally loyal him.  They were originally recruited from the ranks of the SA, and yes it was originally supposed to be all "Aryan".  (Several original members had to be "Grandfathered in" due to this "racial" requirement.)  Members did have to trace back their lineage to 1750 or so to show no Jewish family members.   Himmler's goal was to create a new aristocracy with the SS, having SS members administer the new lebensraum in Eastern Europe.  As the German Reich grew, with occupied territories and Himmler's obsession with creating a large organization, other nationalities were allowed to join: Dutch, Danes, Norwegians, Finns.  All suitably "Aryan".  Later, as losses mounted it was opened up to groups considered untermenschen:  Slavs (but not Poles or Russians), French, Italians, there were even a few Arabs, Indians, Brits, and Americans.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Since there is actually no such thing as "Aryan" I'm sure the criteria for joining were open to interpretation.    They were still terrible people though.|`|SS1VReF0aa	It was purely aryan|`|9f8XoDKJaa	It pretty much was.  All the way down to about 13-14 year olds.  That way they could corrupt everyone.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	Yeah, those scum were white supremacists. They talked of 'honour' and 'glory' while they were preying on some of the weakest and isolated people in society.

I'm also a Christian. Fanatics in the Christian faith forget the two most important rules in the Bible are to love God and love one another. Forcing my beliefs on anyone does not show love, it shows intolerance. Jesus did not force anyone to follow Him, He offered them the choice to follow Him.    I think a "Christofacist" is a mis-guided Christian. Should I force them to change....nope because then I would become a Christofacist.     If there are Christofacists, then there must also be atheofacists, those fanatics who try to force others into thinking there is no God. Most athiests do not fit in this category but there are a lot who do and most of them are in the religion forum on Yahoo Answers. Just my own opinion.... I have seen a new found faith in God help people to overcome drugs, alcohol, give up smoking, mend marriages. Can those things be accomplished without God...yes but God is the way these people have chosen and the atheofacists are unmerciful in their berating attacks.     It's not always easy to show the love for others that God calls me to.|`|4lINNvG5aa	If you are not allowed to say Islamofascist because of the political correct police you can't say Christofascist.

The Pacific theater was essentially all US.  While in WWI the bulk of the war was fought by the Allies without the fresh US troops it likely would have continued to drag on.    With US troops coming to the European theater there never would have been a D-Day invasion.  Britain did not have anywhere near enough troops.    Sure the US tries to take some undeserved credit, but hey that's the way we are.

So whoever said the Russians would be speaking German... What a laughable thing to say.  If it wasn't for the Russians YOU would probably be speaking German.  And the pacific theatre was not entirely yank; look at Burma for example.    MaryLou S - you are not very knowledgable about this it would seem.  The Royal Air Force was maintaining a good defence during the battle of Britain and the German planned offensive was named Operation Sealion.  If you did some research you would find out that after the war they played a wargame simulation of Sealion with the real German military chiefs to find out what would have happened.  The Germans lost.  Now a wargame is not usually good incentive for evidence, but seeing as the defences set up in Britain were nigh impenetrable and we had the Home Guard and this was an unbiased, well planned wargame it was very realistic.  And the Germans were not beating the Russians - the Russians kicked the Germans out of Stalingrad which was in the first place a stupid strategic maneuver - what the hell are you on about?  This is WWII we are talking about, I have no idea which war you're thinking of.|`|EOZ8OdK0aa	Because in fact without American intervention in both wars Europe would now be called the Democratic Republic of Germany.  In WWI the European allies were losing badly on the Eastern and Western fronts.  They basically were begging at that point for the US to help them out. With the influx of American forces it pushed the Germans back and finally ended the war.  In WWII the same scenario was playing out.  Hitler had pretty much conquered everything to the West and was at the English channel waiting to cross toward England.  He was crushing the Russians and pushing toward Moscow.  Had the Japanese not enticed the US into the war, you could be looking at a totally different Europe.  At that time the US was more concerned with climbing out of decade long depression than with getting into a large scale war.  In fact the US was ill-prepared for war at the time of Pearle.  It took almost a year of constant losses after they entered the war to really get on track with production of munitions, planes, ships etc.  But once the war machine was in full swing--game over.|`|p20g4z1Naa	Where the heck are you from?

Then Germany politically invaded near our turf with the proposal of the Zimmerman treaty to Mexico, which royally pissed us off.     We tipped the scales, period.     Plus during the first WW, you all had so many provices and territories. You all had INdia for one ( and others like Hong Kong). It's tough to maintain all these provinces and colonies throughout the world while fighting Super Germans. We just came to lend a hand.    We also saw that those nations, like Belgium, Russia, etc. that just stood around in neutrality at first ultimately got sucked into the war....the Nazi regime did not recognize neutrality, one was with Germany or against them. The U.S. knew this and realized that one oway or anthor, sooner or later, we too would be sucked into the war - - so we entered sooner.|`|NMRGGsTxaa	You need to read some books or watch the history channel or something.

Our lend Lease and our material Kept Britain alive, If we had chosen to remain out of the Europeon theater and just fought Japan, Britain would of capitulated in probably 6 months to a year because of starvation. Your forgetting we gave Britain alot of material before we actually started fighting. We gave them Tanks, guns, destroyers, etc. D-Day does not happen with out the U.S. Without our Liberty ships Britain's merchant fleet is destroyed. No merchant Fleet no munitions, attrition would start to take its toll and soon the Royal Air Force would be destroyed after constant attack. The Royal Navy would have to prevent an Invasion but without oil they are stuck in port. Russia would survive for a while but against the full force of the German army, Russia would sign a peace treaty after Moscow fell. All of Europe, Northern Africa, the Middle East would all be speaking German, oh one last thing the war started Sept. 1939 we came in Dec. 1941, the war ended April 1945 how did we come in at the end explain that to me. Oh and don't call us posers, the United States is a proud country with a proud History dating back the the Revolution. We are no more of a poser then you are. The United States has looked defeat in the eye and spit it in and fought back to Victory, We have never and will never Surrender. So before you bad mouth the United states read your History Books.
EnODJeIcaa	Obama is a civil rights attorney from the South Side of Chicago...He has spent most if not all of his entire adult life working for NON-PROFIT organizations fighting for the "little guy"    Obama lives in a bubble where people who are not wealthy are victims...And though it has been proven time and time again he refuses to look at the fact that when an employer is able to keep more of it's money and not give it to the fed...The employees benefit from that.    If my boss has to pay an extra 10% in taxes because the White House thinks he makes too much...It is less likely that I will get a raise this year, and instead of the company giving money to the employees...they give it to Washington...Makes perfect sense...That's how you stimulate the economy...You take all the money from the producers and you channel it through the bureaucratic nightmare called the US Government.    Obama is a civil rights attorney with no clue on how to stimulate the economy...Giving handouts to people does not stimulate anything...Letting everyone keep more of their money helps.    Obama's liberal Harvard perspective looks at businesses and the men who run them as the evil the corporations who are keeping a brother down...but if you handicap those companies with tax burdens...what do they do to their employees? Fire them....cut thier hours.    He has oodles and oodles of good intentions...But all the good intentions of the Democrat liberal ideology has thus far caused the sub prime lending meltdown and ultimately kick started the recession...    But this is the core difference between Democrats and Republicans...Democrats think that everyone should pay more so that the government can give more freebies, and Republicans believe EVERYONE should keep as much of their money is as absolutely possible.    This time the Democrats have no one to blame for their mess, so it better work for them.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	Probably knows just as much as Bush or even more.|`|3MM64geHaa	It is wealth envy.

Since they did not pare back the expenses (actually they increased them) then we have a deficit. the longer this is allowed to go on the greater the accumulated debt. With the top 5% representing more than half of the government's income, 1% drop from them means more dollars than a 1% drop for the remaining 95%. Consider that the top tax bracket is at 35% but the actual tax paid due to loopholes in the tax laws is only 11%. that's less % than I pay and I earned only $40,000 last year.  Anyway, the long and the short of it is that this debt will ultimately have to be paid back and it will be paid uniformly by all taxpayers per their tax brackets. So the short fall from the wealthy will and is shouldered by the rest of us.  BTW: I don't think Obama is an economic genius by any measure but he has surrounded himself with some of the best. add to that Senator McCain declared during the primaries that 'the economy wasn't his strong suit but he bought Alan Greenspan's book.'

t7KHxE2Iaa	It means both. He described it as a "wall" of separation. Religion on one side, government on the other and neither gets to cross the wall.    The government will not make a state religion. In return for the safety of not being subject to a state religion that may not be theirs, religions stay away from the government.    The government is not in the business of defining what a religion is or is not. That's why tax subsidies are a bad idea. Who's to say who gets them? A lot of non-traditional faiths could make a very convincing argument that they deserve those tax cuts as well. Are we really going to leave the decisions in the hands of politicians? They'll just give the tax cuts to whoever donated more money to their campaign!    Likewise, if we only have Christian prayer in schools, then the state has shown preference for that faith over any other. The fair thing to do is to give equal time to each. But, of course then we get into the problem of which religions are valid. By the time we've got that figured out, you've got 2 hours of class time to devote to a variety of prayers. Better to leave it out of the schools entirely.    The founding fathers saw all these problems (they had dealt with them in England and already in the colonies: many different faiths were competing to be the national religion). So, they made that wall of separation. The founders didn't even share the same religion! They were deists, as well puritans and Anglicans and a variety of others.    Its kind of like your kindergarten teacher telling you that if you don't bring a cupcake for everyone in the class, you can't bring them for your five friends. But then maybe one classmate is allergic to gluten. Another isn't allowed to have chocolate. Another hates icing. So you need 25 regular chocolate cupcakes, one gluten-free one, one vanilla one, and one without icing. Better to just have the cupcakes at home with your original five friends, don't you think?|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I have generally held the view that the Constitutional aspect was designed to allow freedom to practice religion free from state sponsored tyranny, or state created religious entities like the Church of England. Most of our modern day interpretations on the issue spring from Thomas Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists. It was this very letter which provided the "Wall of Separation" phrase. It was also cited in subsequent Supreme Court hearings on the matter. Honestly though the answer is that there is no answer. The idea is not as clearly defined as many would like it to be on both sides of the aisle. If you are really interested in the subject though, you can find some very interesting information by visiting the link posted below, including the draft text of the Jefferson's letter with text that was not included in the final version and some of his motivation regarding why the letter was written.|`|EOZ8OdK0aa	It literally means a separation between both parties. The writers of the constitution wanted in no way to be like England who was beholding to the church of England.  As history has told us the church was very influential in European politics.  The settlers who came to and founded America left because many were fleeing religious persecution.  That's why we included the freedom of religion clause in the constitution.  However, because the writers of that same document were religious men, they included language and references to god within that same document.    The overall consensus is that the founding fathers did want the church to play a powerful part in the governing of the new nation.  Nor did they want one singular unit to be the sole religious aspect of the country.  ie.  Solely a Catholic or Protestant nation.|`|5Ho518J9aa	"we" haven't...THEY have. Those of us who actually believe in something greater than ourselves have known all along. It was, however also meant to protect the Government from being controlled by the Catholic Church, as had happened throughout European history. Hence, the Spanish Inquisition, the Church of England, etc. Jefferson never intended for an Atheist society, he simply wanted to protect the Free Exercise of Religious beliefs, thereby ensuring a faithful, free society.|`|XwtmNIMOaa	The separation goes both ways. It means that in an ideal situation government and religion would have nothing to do with each other. Sure many of the founders were religious. That does not stop them from supporting the separation. In fact the earliest cases of separation being invoked involved catholics upset over protestant practices by the government.|`|AA11103371	Nope.      You can't have freedom for all if "god" is only for some.      Christians can't even agree on Christianity.   There are tons of different types of christianity from baptists to catholics and everything in between.  How could there be a national religion?      The Constitution does not mention god once.|`|ynt3LAX3aa	Actually, there is supposed to be no politicking in the church.  That means that God's laws reign supreme and that politicians should not be campaigning in the churches like Obama and others have done.  Secondly it means that the churches are not supposed to lobby or get involved in politics -- that's why they are tax exempt.  However, today, there is no separation of church and state except to the extent that the churches are permitted to harbor fugitives and ignore U.S. law.  I propose that every church that harbors fugitives or allows politicking in the church or any church that gets involved in politics in any way should have their tax exempt status revoked and be required to pay back taxes on every piece of property and every bit of income received.  That's the only way we are going to get this country back on track.
Cppi6kRFaa	I may be mistaken but I believe your R&R starts when you leave the base. If you were to get delayed in the airport for two days that goes against your R&R. It doesn't matter when you get home. For example I took leave from Germany and got delayed at Rammstein Airforce Base. Thats how I spent my first day leave.

I didn't get to germany until 0700 so they didn't count that day.  my leave actually started on the 16th and it ended on the 2nd of sep and then I flew out on the 3rd.  They're not gonna be that anal about your leave date they would just guarantee you that you get a full 18 days of leave, thus making it seem like you get an extra day.  From Aug 16 to Sep2 that's 18 days, there's 31days in Aug.  they didn't count the 15 aug although i came in really early, and the 3SEP because it wasn't a full day.

Odds are, the cost will be less than their deductible, so the money will come out of their pockets.    If they refuse to cover it, you'll have to sue in small claims.    All that said, it's a lot of hassle for $200, it'll cost you at least one day off work, etc...    On the other hand, I have to tell you that any vehicle with an exhaust system that low should not be driving on any roads, public or private, and that may make collecting almost impossible.

AA11101361	Paper money generally has a life of 8 months to a year.  A coin can concievably last 20 years, so it saves the government over a hundred million dollars a year.  Also, people won't use coinage when there's a paper alternative.  There were dollar coins in Canada before the loonie.  I remember when the loonie came out, it was a pretty big deal.
RkfIPD7Iaa	Just economics.  Coins are more expensive to make, but last much longer.      It was also partly at the urging of the vending machine companies.  Unlike the US, Canadian bills aren't suited for 'bill readers', so our vending machines only use coins, and feeding in $2 worth of coins is a pain and fills the machines too quickly.|`|CowgOqXTaa	To save money.    A coin costs about 5 times as much to make as a bill, but last a hundred times as long.    Richard|`|68HSmMgXaa	Like the others said, it saves on costs because they last way longer.  A bit of trivia for your project, 5$ coins are also being cosidered because of cigarette vending machines.  But the bills would still be printed and kept in circulaton  The 1$ coins we call "loonies" because of the loon on it, it was a nickname originally, but quickly because common usage, and when the 2$ coins came out, they quite naturally, became "toonies".  Also, the toonies are made of two different metals, silver coloured on the outside with a gold coloured circle in the middle, and when they first came out sometimes they came apart.  They quickly fixed the problem, but people would always try to break them apart.    Hope this all helps.

Don't forget, those vacuum seal bags are a roll, and fit rifles quite nicely. Plant a garden this spring, if we have that long. Kiss your kids, and enjoy every day as if it were your last. Be ready to fight for your very life, because this has happened before, and get in touch with God like you're ready to fall down at his feet and beg him for forgiveness. Never say nobody warned you ALL of what was coming, because you ALL laughed in our faces.|`|AA11847612	He put them through the same vetting process that the media used for him.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Nope. He's off to a great start.    ? Won approval of the second $350 billion in TARP funds *before* taking office.  ? VP Biden already made his first foreign trip *before* taking office.  ?

Mitchell is already on the scene.  ? Got most of his cabinet confirmed.   ? Made family planning advice more available to women in Africa.  ?

I'm a little suspicious of politicians of any party who start talking 'ethics' and 'cleaning up', I don't mean they always turn out 'dirty' but they can not control everything and everybody in their administration. But if they make promises they can't keep, it is not right.

Do3ZDvJwaa	Well I work as a Chaplain Assistant for the 55th Combat Camera Company at Fort Meade.  I go there almost every two weeks and visit them at thier workplace.  The company has over 100 25V and you may one day work there.  The company goes on deployment missions where they are attached to units and pretty much document via photograph and video thier missions, movements, etc.  Deployments isn't the only place that you go.  I have buddies there that have gone to Thailand, South America, Korea, Japan.  It's pretty much where the mission takes you.  When you are not overseas and you are doing daily operations you are fixing and preparing your equipment for upcoming missions.  Also the 55th COMCAM Company does photo of the month/year competitions to up thier skills.  But for the most part when they are not on mission they pretty much do nothing lol.  You will have a chance to work with alot of people and get your photographs out in the public.  I think  you picked a good job and I believe that you will love it.  If you want to look up one of the biggest operational 25V companies look up the 55th Combat Camera Comapany attached the 114th Signal Battalion, 21st Signal Brigade.  And if you ever get a chance to go there I advise to go.

Looking deeper at these offerings, there is an attempt to "equalize" the playing field as if to say, "they have a female or black candidate and so do we" without regard to reflection or critical comparison of each candidate's career history and subsequent relevance.  When these candidates adopt the same strategies, then they can be criticized for being fatuous and arbitrary, or worse, self-deluded. To drastically illustrate the point, because I figured out Euclids 4th theorem, does this put my accomplishments on a par with Einstein's? This is not to say they are incapable of doing something great or even just useful. It just means that they haven't yet, and shouldn't believe themselves to be equal to or better than those who have.

The only reason he has not, is he wants to share the blame with as many of them as he can.|`|AA11450062	No, I think the American people know that they can throw all the money they want at our Republican economy it will still hit bottom. Obama is just trying to make the crash smoother.

Therefore, if the prospect of delaying the stimulus package sounds like scare tactics then it may just be that you have something valid to fear unlike GWB's continual theme of 'fear' that he used from 9/11/2001 to 1/20/2009.

And if you've got this many disgruntled taxpayers venting their spleen on this idiotic pay-off, just imagine how many millions of people really feel about it that haven't been heard. I don't know how hard they intend on beating this dead horse, but the show is kinda entertaining and sure beats watching Leave It To Beaver (though I gotta admit that Eddie shoulda ran for political office with his schmoozing tactics). If Mr. President wants to really fix our economy, he should repeal NAFTA. Google that and see what you learn. None other than our illustrious former president Bill Clinton signed that peach into law and sent our jobs overseas. That's why we're in the big pile of dog doo-doo we're in right now. And that's why we owe China more money than this "stimulus" will ever fix. The only thing this congress can safely pass (and that's bordering on skeptical) is gas. We should all be on our phones right now, telling the bums to quit farting around with our money and tell all our companies to come back home where they belong. Call it protectionism if you want to. I call it putting America back to work. |`|fkWT0CS1aa	It is all ridiculous! We all know that the housing market is the core of our economy.

You want stimulous...have the governement take that so called stimulous package and pay off the American Citizens mortgages. Give us the checks pre written out to our mortgage companies so it does in fact go where it needs to. Let the friggin banks have it..and then let them crash and burn on their own. Once they have the billions of dollars in their pockets, I don't give a rats *** what they do with it! All I know is that we, the American people are suffering and no one cares!...too many out out of their homes because the Democrats allowed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to produce these crazy sub prime loans that they knew the home buyers could not afford. American people work hard for what they have and should not have to worry about how they we going to provide for our children and ourselves. This country is too great and powerful to be going through this. Give the American People back our money and let us pay off our own debt. We all know we can do a better job than the fat cats in washington anyway. This Government has too many hands in our pockets and could care less about what happens to us. They need to stop providing for the illegal immigrants as well and help their fellow Americans! It is time for all Americans to stand united and let them know we are tired of the same old bullshit and want results..NOW before we are all left in the cold with no where to go...Unless the messiah Obama wants to let us all live in the white house ..since afterall, our tax dollars are paying for it!|`|10gI6rFKaa	No but the government is not interested in our support on anything unless it involves voting and even then it is iffy....they couldn't care less about support and are far ,more interested in our compliance.|`|CM1dfztQaa	It's not workin on me.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Many Americans got scared when the Bush administration told us that our financial system was about to collapse.

First spouses of both parties in recent history have almost always been active advocates for various causes. Laura Bush helped shape policy on education and women's health, Hillary Clinton was a champion of human rights (especially those of women and children) around the world, and, as mentioned above, Nancy Reagan was an outspoken advocate of anti-drug education and legislation. This is a formal enough role that First Ladies have their own White House office and staff, and have for quite some time.    Michelle Obama's spokesperson said, "[o]ur job is to think through with the president and with the president's team and assist in dialogue about policy. But the president is the policymaker." This is exactly as it should be, and exactly how Mrs. Bush, Mrs. Reagan, and (arguably to a lesser extent) Mrs. Clinton handled their White House roles.

To keep the predators in check, and let more people take the harvest of the hunt, they allow hunting of wolves.     And in the wilderness of Alaska, the most efficient way is from the air.    As for the absurdly childish and irrational claim that opening the small portion of ANWR that was originally set aside for oil exploration and extraction will somehow "rape" the other 97% of the pristine WNWR land, well, only an uninformed leftist tweak would consider that a valid argument.

yh2hr3Vfaa	Your recruiter will ask you allot of preliminary qualifying questions first.  You would be surprised how many are not qualified to join.  If you pass all that he/she will give you a 45 min screening test to see if you can pass the asvab.  If you show a qualifying score they will schedule you for the asvab test and to go to meps for your physical and job classification. He will also schedule you to get together to do all your preliminary enlistment paperwork.    Because you are a high school graduate you are not eligible for the DEP. You will be shown jobs that you qualify for out to a maximum of 90 days from the date you are at meps. Either you pick a job and get a contract or you don't . You could leave for basic training in as little as 3 days up to 3 months depending on the job you picked.    When it's time to ship out for basic the recruiter will pick you up at home and take you to meps. Meps will  take all the shippers by bus to the airport and give you airplane tickets. Someone will meet you at your destination and take you to boot camp. You don't need to bring anything but yourself.    You will need your H.S. Diploma, Social Security card and birth certificatewhen you do paperwork. They will be returned to you after your processing at meps.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Mostly right.  At the recruiter's office I believe they're only allowed to give a practice ASVAB these days, so that the actual ASVAB for record is properly proctored by someone who would not be tempted to boost a candidates score.    DEP is now pretty much a given.  Unless you are going for something odd like Musician (they traditionally are in a MU only division that forms in mid summer) a June start date may be do-able,  although you might find that slots are starting to fill up.|`|yBuKIocraa	you need to get a physical and junk|`|FfZBJzpbaa	you got the process down right , you go to DEP if there is no open space for you at the time in boot camp or your "A" school.

When its time for you to get shipped off to great lakes ill. for your boot camp your recruiter will come pick you up and take you  to MEPS and they will put you on a plane or a bus to get there. You don't have to worry about that.    have fun, the NAVY is a great career and very rewarding.

That time is fast approaching and in my opinion, it can't come to soon.    EDIT - LittleBit    The fact that you don't seem all that concerned or angry about our Constitution being trampled bothers me!      You say, "Never for any kind of reason."  I can't believe that an American would ever have audacity to speak those words.  Are you appalled at the actions of the founders of our nation?  Do you think they shouldn't have revolted?  Remember the Revolutionary War started over unfair taxation.  Apparently you don't think it is right to fight for the future of our children?  Apparently you would be fine with them being slaves of the state?  Apparently you have the false notion in your head that everything can be solved peacefully.  In all honesty, I feel bad for people like you.

The ussr actually made it easy for the us to spread fear of the reds because of communism's mandate for expansion and the nations views that shocked american sensibilities.  you are correct though that in many ways it was flip sides of the same coin|`|axHyoVqGaa	Your mistaken.  Communism most certainly does exist, as an idea and it is responsible for many of the world's problems because as long as it exists as an idea, people will strive for it and in the process freedoms will be oppressed.  Granted, our form of government isn't perfect, but it is the best to date and as long as that is true, I will continue to support it.  If a better form comes along, then my opinion may change, but without a doubt, I can tell you that Communism is not it.  It can never work because it fails to take into account human nature.|`|JpvXhgmraa	scapegoating....................|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Fear.

Russia happened to be a superpower at that era that had expansionary goals of extending their quasigovernment/economic style on other nations...and you know how the US feels about rapid expansion of ideas not akin to ours,,,|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	because communism makes people go crazy!!!!!! even if it's not happening people think it's happening. and if they don't think it's happening then they get all scared that it's going to happen! then they start blaming everyone around them that communism is going to take over!!!! and then that lying son-o-***** johnson had to send us to war!!!|`|mY4m47WTaa	Capitalism in its pure form hasn't existed either. Neither has Democracy (except briefly in ancient Greece). So what is your point? Nice try, but you can't shut down the argument like that and say "we'll lets try it in its pure form and maybe the world will be a better place." It has been demonstrated as an utter failure to bring peace and prosperity to humanity.     Revolution in the _name_ of Communism has been responsible for the state murder of more civilians than all of the people killed in combat combined in the last century. Over 100 million civilians were slaughtered directly by murder or indirect murder by famine (USSR, China). It has been demonstrated as the most evil ideology to ever by embraced by human beings in their short history. Just as the Nazi party has been outlawed in Germany, so should Communism be outlawed by the UN. It fails to take into account the utter depravity and corruption that comes from absolute power. When the noted Socialist/Communist Emma Goldman traveled to the USSR to see the grand experiment in practice, she was utterly disillusioned by the mass murder and oppression she saw there. Upon returning to North America, she became a pariah to her former Communist buddies because they just couldn't believe what she was saying was true. Communism was good, it had to work! Sorry, no dice.     Btw- We didn't start Vietnam. Their Communist revolution was responsible for hundreds of thousands of murders (NOT counting people killed in combat) and the imprisonment and refugee status of a few million more, as well as building an oppressive police state. Talk to some Communist refugees sometime. All of the anti-Imperialist/American demonstrations by the masses in the streets were forced at gunpoint. If you didn't join in, you were either killed, or sent to a prison camp to be "re-educated".     Communism has been demonstrated as an utterly corrupt concept in practice on a large scale. It is _not_ about freedom and humanism. It is the ultimate evil statist ideology.|`|8091157cce079beb55128deba743200caa	You fail to mention the atrocities of the USSR. The gulag prisons, the mass graves, the berlin wall, the KGB, any of these are far worse than the examples you give. The problem that America had with Communism started with the cold war. With the US and USSR on the brink of nuclear war, the government took no chances when it came to Communists. As far as Socialism goes, it sounds good on paper but it doesn't really work. Socialist/Communist theories in economics take away any and all ambition to succeed. If each worker in a factory is guaranteed the same salary as the next guy no matter what, where is the motivation to work hard or be productive. Why work when you're guaranteed a pay check? This exact reason led to the eventual downfall of the USSR.     And don't bash the country that allows you so many freedoms that Communist countries wouldn't. (eg: North Korea, Russia, China, etc...)|`|AA11847612	And if you had been raised in the USSR, you would have been taught that capitalism was the problem. It's called propaganda. It's what governments do to control the people.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Propaganda, don't you recognize similarities between it and Bush's and it and the Nazi's, I do.|`|4Aauh87yaa	Capitalism has done more to better the situation of mankind than any other economic system that has ever existed.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	it did,and your probably about to find out.what do you think china and cuba are?|`|sLEdPDkHaa	Because  there is good and there is evil and Communists are evil|`|V7JVKApkaa	True Communism (as you claim), on a national level, can never exist. It can only exist in small groups, or communes, of volunteers. The reason it can't exist in large groups or nations, is because it violates normal human behavior.     Communism, practiced on a national level, requires fascism or dictatorships, to keep the people in-line.        It is the undemocratic nature of communism that was the issue, not the economic injustice it inspires.|`|AA11304025	It was politics for simple people.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	According to the Karl Marx, communism rules, and he had an argument against every other type of government.  Communism is his baby, after all.    His idea that democracy would collapse and give way to communism is the trick, this theory was planted as part of his transformation, in the hope that some future generation would become dissatisfied with democracy and would want to launch a revolution to change over to communism.    Karl Marx was a smart economist, but his proposed solution, communism, is often abused by the governments that implement it.  Marx did not desire this outcome, his failure to consider human nature is a primary flaw of communism.    Communism in its true unadulterated form does exist, you can find it right here in the US, and I'm not talking about Democrats, I'm talking about groups like the Hooterites or the Amish.  They practice communism, and it exists within a country with a capitalist framework.  It's not so bad on the small scale, but I wouldn't want to live like that, lack of choices.|`|wbIEau0qaa	communism, the theory is not that bad at all. it pretty much states everyone is the same. the americans were afraid it was too good, and it could kill the rich folks and they fought against it. it wasnt like communisn was coming to the US, it was the US was afraid and they attack comminism.|`|POJNnWhDaa	Because we knew all along it would make you ask this question. That is the one and only reason for the cold war. It all led up to this question on yahoo answers. We can all move on now.|`|DibFrwxlaa	Well the USSR strove to establish a communist state.  Whether it actually existed or not is immaterial.      The USSR was an aggressive, imperialist nation hell bent on ideological domination of the world.     Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire and he was exactly right.    The US may have done some not so great things in our efforts to fend of communist advances but this was certainly a case of the ends justifying the means as far as I'm concerned.|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	Could it be the millions killed or enslaved by the leaders of the USSR, North Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea, Cuba? Or the killing and enslaving of millions of people in the neighboring countries of eastern Europe, and Asia by those nations? Call it what you will, Those nations and the system of government they used were not good for anyone but the few in charge.
qOw6IFZwaa	My first thought is.. wherever they need to see. Most I have seen have them pointing forward|`|RvVvaVsAaa	when they stop you, they aim it at your car. if they are driving around in the neighborhood for curfews and stuff like that they shine it to the side..|`|iNQK27Qqaa	during a traffic stop? when they are driving? need a bit more info/stuff|`|P4Jc76GPaa	Your question is very vague. Basically a police officer will point it in the direction they need to see. An ex would be if he was shining his light at a person, he would be able to see them, but it would be hard for them to see him. It enables the police officer to have an advantage. Hope this helps.
vFvI16P7aa	Reserves are not full time and their cars don't need to be replaced as often.  Dept's won't spend that kind of money on a reserve.

Our reserved must ride with a commissioned officer at all times.|`|AAoQzU7oaa	the reserves are part time and not needed as much as full time so therefore they get what ever is left behind......like the 04's......also there is this thing like who is going to pay for these 08's?  you?|`|DsEEATKSaa	They should all be driving '61 Corvairs.    ~M~|`|AA12255473	they should be all glad they're not getting a 1975 Ford Pinto..   people here are so incredibly spoiled.

I gave birth on my bin day last yr and funnily enough I didn't get chance to put the bin out! I called the council and explained that I would have extra rubbish the following week and wouldn't get it all in the bin, and they told me I would be charged 30 for every extra bag! Thankfully I have great neighbours whom all took a bag each and squished it in theirs.    So on the weekend when the snow has thawed and im taking my own rubbish to the dump as the bin men didn't arrive on tuesday when it wasn't even snowing, can I charge them 30 a bag!    oh I hope so....|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	Buddha is right but I understand where your coming from.

I have this problem often. I mean that's why we pay our tax's. So go for it.
FKJaQXQLaa	You will get very basic combat training.  All Marines do, regardless of MOS.  The actual chances of you seeing combat are virtually nil.  You will be most likely assigned a job far away from the front lines.  If you were ever to see combat, it would be because the enemy has completely broken through the lines and has advanced all the way to the rear.  In this day and age, that will most likely never happen.  The idea that every Marine is a rifleman first is in reality an outdated concept.  This was born of the Vietnam war.  Back then, the enemy was everywhere, and no one was safe.  Even in a rear area.  Today, there are non-combat troops deployed with the combat troops.  Look at the Green Zone in Iraq.  There are civilians and lots of non-combat troops there.  They are surrounded by lots of combat troops who do their jobs to protect them so that they may do their jobs.  Everything we do in war have been lessons learned in previous wars.  Being a Machingunner in the Corps, I have had occasion to help cross train cooks, radiomen, truck drivers, and mechanics in the use of the machinegun.  We fired live rounds over the heads of my buddies during live exercises.  Believe me when I tell you this, I would never want to go into combat with someone other than a real infantryman.  What it all boils down to is everyone has a job in the Corps that they are good at.  I wouldnt make a very good cook or radioman, and they dont make very good infantrymen either.  You will get crosstraining in infantry weapons and tactics but will in all likelihood, never get to put it to use.|`|lrsLI2JGaa	There's no clear answer for this.  At any moment in the field you could be attacked and have to fight.  If you're placed in a job with computers, then there may be less of a chance you'd be put in a situation where you'd have to shoot someone.  But think about it, if you're joining an organization whose job it is is to fight other people (especially the Marines), then maybe you should look into working with computers somewhere else.|`|Xa11cmVNaa	Marines are trained for combat first then everything else is second... I know Female Marines who have seen combat (although the gov't won't admit it) Cooks, Supply even admin. are all trained to be combat ready. Your fist job is that of a basic rifleman, after boot camp you go to MCT (combat school) then you go to your job school. you won't be thrown in to a combat situation unless you're needed or you get ambushed but make no mistake you can end up under fire|`|EOZ8OdK0aa	UHH YES.  Just because you want to do a particular job does not mean after basic you will get that posting.  Your first job as marine is to be fighting machine--PERIOD.  IF you want to join and be away from the action join the Air Force.|`|enFe2aD0aa	Yes, you can be in combat with a non-combat MOS. I was a public affairs officer in Iraq in 2003 and lo and behold, I was thrusted into combat. The Marines are very adamant that every Marine learns to fight, because in teh end, we are all thee to serve our country and do what has to be done, whether it be as a cook, admin, infantry or supply guy. We are all issued the standard M16A2 service rifle and all are given teh same training. Obviously, the infantry Marines get more training and are out in the front lines, but you have to be realistic in teh sense that if you sign up for the Marines (or Army, Navy, etc.), you may one day be in combat. No, you're not going to be a cook and be in a line unit, BUT you can be attached to an infantry unit, and if push comes to shove while you're in a combat zone, then be glad you got that training in how to defend yourself or fire the rifle.|`|z42u6Tbkaa	Yea of course you could get ambushed and see combat. But, thats unlikely, one of the platoon fobs in my company had a cook with them and he didn't patrol. He cooked and did other stuff. Our comm guys stayed at the nice big company fob and only left if we forced them to because our radios wouldn't work and they couldn't talk us through fixing it. Iraq has come a long way since 2003.

It's a British territory but Argentina claim it's theirs. The funny thing is that it was British territory before Argentina formed as a country.    Argentina tried to take the islands (the Falklands and South Georgia) in 1982. Britain declared war on Argentina and took back the islands. And Argentina still want it.    Yes, there was air combat between the two but it was largely a naval battle. A few thousand Argentines surrendered when the British forces charged towards them while outnumbered.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	The above answers are basically true, some facts are a bit off. The Green Howerds didn't go to the Falklands and whilst the SAS did take part the elite Paratroopers and Marines did the majority of the work.     The SAS allegedly took part in an attempt to blow up Argentinian Air Force planes but the attempt failed because of a helicopter crash and the troops had to escape to Chile.    The unasked question is "Why are Britain interested in an island 8000 miles away?" Could it actually be something to do with territorial claims to Antartic oil???? Who knows.|`|p20g4z1Naa	The Falkland Islands are a small group of islands about 300 miles of the coast of Argentina and have been under the control of the British government since the early 1830's.  The Argentine junta was under severe financial crisis and needed to to distract ther population from the financial problems.  What better way to getan up swing in national pride than to start a war with the UK.  Initially things went well, I believe there was a small contigent of Royal Marines that were ovecome easily.  The Brits sent a naval task force which was promptly attacked by Argentine Skyhawks carrying French Exocet anti ship milles and sank a number of british ships.  The Brits quickly regained the initiative and crushed the Argentines.  I think there were a few dog fights.  The Brits sank the Bel Grano which was a battleship that went down with a tremendous loss of life. The battle of Goose Green is something of a legend.  The Gurkas, RM, Paras and Green Howards were there I believe too.  I think the Brits also sank an Argentine sub as well.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	The Falkland Islands are a British territory, but Argentina claims that they actually belong to them.    Most probably they were won by the British a long time ago when that sort of thing happened.    Both countries have been arguing over sovereignty for years and eventually the Argentinean government decided to take them back by force.    It's probably fair to say that they did so at the time more to distract the population of Argentina away from pressing domestic issues and there's nothing like a good war to get people waving the flag.    Unfortunately the Brits like a good war themselves...hence the fact we are here now speaking English.    So the British fought for what they claimed was their territory and they won.    And yes, there were air battles...the Argentinean had French Mirage aircraft and the Brits has Harriers because they of course were operating from carriers.    As an observor and a pupil of military history who is neither British or Argentinean I don't think it was ever in any doubt who would win.  The British army was always going to get the better of the Argentinean defenders and the Royal Navy was always going to have the edge at sea.  The only possible way the Argentineans could have controlled things was to use their air force since clearly that had an advantage being able to use land based aircraft from airfields in Argentina.    It just didn't quite work out that way, the Brits managed to gain air superiority and the Argentineans got a little worried and grounded their planes to avoid direct conflict and losses....so the Brits used their SAS special forces and blew the planes up on the ground.    In the end the Argentinean forces on the island surrendered and the Brits left a garrison there and that's where we stand at this point in time.|`|HRCFViataa	the falkland islands are british territory with a british population. Because they are off the coast of argentina, they believe the islands belong to them, so invaded.  The british sent a task force to reclaim them, britain lost several ships due to the french (our so called allies) selling argentina exocet anti ship missiles.  there was air combat, in which the british shot down a large number of aircraft for very little lost in return.  The real fighting came on the ground, with the Argentine's fighting bravely, but were no real match for the british, in some battles they out number the british as much as 5 to 1.        Ref: below    The S.A.S  asulted  argentine airfields on the falkland themselves before the main landings, blewing up pucara ground attack plane, which could of destroyed the british landings.    The chopper that landed in chillie was part of a mission to take out the super E that were using exocets against the british ships|`|HOdisPCWaa	I know this is politics however If Thatcher had listened to her Military advisers many of our service men would not have been killed she was advised a year prior to the invasion she should increase RN patrols in the waters and also increase land forces on the Island many believe if she had done so the invasion would never have happened.  I have read her reasons were down to her failing popularity and she felt a war and victory would rally the people round her? In much the same way as the British people rallied round Churchill.|`|orn3Z7loaa	The falkland islands is an island group off the coast of Argentina. Argentina invaded and took over the islands. The UK responded with and invasion force of its own. Yes there was air combat Argentina, sank i believe 2 British destroyers with anti ship missiles launched from A-4 skyhawks. The British army reclaimed the island chain and they still control it today.|`|Q8neCpquaa	Everyone here has answered this pretty good. However, an interesting note:  The Falkland Islands war was the first and only time a "Nuclear" Submarine ever sank an enemy warship in combat. The HMS Conqueror torpedoed and sank the ARA Belgrano ( a light armored cruiser formerly the USS Phoenix of the U.S. Navy)
1jUGukznaa	Your husband can quite likely receive word about the baby directly from you.  This will depend on his and his flights standing.  The better they are, the more privileges he/they will have (including telephone time).  I know this, as I was at Lackland AFB in the same capacity as he will be in.    His unit at Basic will have a telephone number and you can call the commanding officer who will relay the information to him (probably through his TI - In the Air Force they are called Training Instructors, or TIs, not Drill Instructors, or DIs, like the Army and Marines call them) as soon as you deliver.  Red Cross only gets involved if there are problems and your husband has to travel home (and he can't travel home for a "healthy" birth).  Also, he WILL NOT be allowed to have a cell phone.    Have your husband either send you this information via a letter or give it to you during one of his phone calls.  Given your timeline, he should wait until he has been there for three or four weeks before doing this.  If there are any complications before then you should contact the Red Cross to reach him.  But if things are going well, just wait until sometime in May and let him get you the information.  Usually by then, the training flights are into more of a routine and the TIs are a bit more like a stern father.  I'm not saying they still can't be mean, but they are more interested in helping you rather than hurting you, especially the closer you get to graduation.    Congratulations to both you and your husband on the (soon to be) birth of your child and his joining the service.  I, for one, think it's a rewarding career.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	The red cross will be able to contact him by then.    Actually, he may be able to give you the number to his Squadron by then.    He can ask his TI for it, of course telling the reason why.    By that point of Basic, ( almost done )     Yes they will give him a chance to call you.|`|qyjXWCA0aa	Nonya is dead on.  It'll be up to the TI but most likely they would let him call home.    A recruiter may say different (and be fibbing) but he could wait until after the baby is born then go through basic.  Problem with that though is you wouldnt have the medical benefits at the time of the birth...and that could be costly.    Good luck|`|juG7X5gyaa	sure - does he have a cell phone? Congratulations!|`|dYuK4JPEaa	You will have to do it through the red cross!    Make sure he lets his TI know so that MAYBE he will be able to call home and check on you that day. But they arent going to let him call all the time so if you are over due or early he probably wont get the message on time. Sorry but it just is part of the military life. You are not the only one dealing with this type of situation!|`|Xa11cmVNaa	It really depends... DI's might let him call or you may have to let the Red Cross know, the military is usually really cool to fathers when their children are born|`|zYQf6y0uaa	If you are married...he will get to come home to be with you..the "MIlitary Way."  Make sure and have the number to reach him .  "Emergency"  No problem honey...HUGS!!|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	You will have to call the Red Cross and they will pass the info to him.  He might be able to call depends on the DI's.|`|Ojk7tMdxaa	It is difficult to say,  make sure that your husband lets his Recruiter, MTI (Drill Sagrent), SNCOIC (highest Ranking Sargent in his Squadron) of his BMT Squadron, and the American Red Cross know, of your situation.  At the very least they will make sure that he gets a message that you have given birth and he will be able to call as soon as possible.  Basic can be difficult at times, but no matter how bad it gets they will not withhold family information about you and the baby from your husband.      Good Luck|`|QTQTdPO1aa	Yes, they will.      As someone else said you'll have to contact the Red Cross, but it's not too hard especially when you're just relaying a message.|`|31bbb49b04434d6657df3ce54e85d85aaa	Congratulations on the new baby.. I am not 100% sure about their rules but... If you contact the Red Cross and have them contact him.. you should be able to at least get him a message.. BUT... the good thing is that most first time moms go over due.. you may just go a week over and he could be there.. pray.. and keep those leggies crossed girly.. lol.. GOOD LUCK.. hope all goes as planned.. I am due May 11th.. I understand how badly you want him there.. I just moved 3500 miles away from all of my family and wish so badly they could be there.. all will work out..

This country is currently in a recession to an extent not seen for 30 years and companies are running on extremely tight marjins.  They can't afford to follow the idealism that is 'British jobs for British workers'.  If someone can do just as good a job (or even better) for a lower price then they have to give them preference.  It's the way business works.  What's the alternative?  They take on British workers who cost them more and aren't as skilled, their overheads go up whilst production goes down, they lose money, they go bust and all of the British workers that do have jobs (not to mention those that are affected by the factory's production, such as delivery drivers) get laid off.|`|QkrfciiAaa	Hey Yo:    Do you remind the Britsh Empire???

NFiiIQcxaa	Minor in possession and consumption by a minor in TX are both class C misdemeanors.  A Class C is punishable by a fine up to $500, and no jail time.  You should see if they will dismiss 3 charges for a guilty or no contest plea on one of them and ask if they will let you do community service in lieu of paying a portion of the fine.  You will also be required to go to alcohol abuse counseling (mandated by the statute).

XRYAfxpTaa	If she entered with a visa, you can file a petition for her and she can file to adjust status. If she entered without a visa, it may be possible, but very difficult. You will still have to meet all financial requirements to sponsor her. She may be required to leave the US and interview in Mexico. She might need a waiver to be able to obtain status.     Your first step would be to file an I-130 petition for alien relative. Upon approval, she would need to file a I-601 for the waiver process and be interviewed in Mexico.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	well, you forgot to say, that your wife has entered the US illegally?   other question from you...  you will not be able to give her any status here in the US ,  to do right? she would have to go back to Mexico and try to enter the legal way,  is she willing to go back to try to do it the legal way?|`|ZqA7qDWAaa	Move to Mexico.

You will be able to get her a green card. If you follow this link you will find a lot of useful information about applying for a green card doing it yourself: http://forums.immigration.com/showthread...    I would suggest to get a lawyer because usually people apply for the green card right after they got married, they do not wait two years. So there might be some sticky things, and even if she was here illegally before you guys got married, she will be fine once you change her immigration status    The fact that you dont have a job right now , its not a HUGE problem, but is a problem: you will need to show that there is somebody else that can guarantee that will be able to take care of your wife if you cannot economically support her. This person can be ANYBODy:relatives,friends, anybody that is willing to guarantee that in case you cannot support her, she will not become a burden on society. This 3rd person will not be involved in the immigration process or pay any money, but they USCIS will want to see their tax returns of the past 2 years.  Also: make sure that your tax are all in order!    Youll be fine. Try to get a lawyer, there are cheap ones out there and generally you can pay them in monthly rates.    Good luck!!|`|vIw3Caibaa	did she enter the country legally? if she did, she can "readjust her status" you will need to file form I130 (petition of immediate relative), I485 (application for Legal Permanent Status) I765(employment doc) , I131 (travel document).   ($1365.00 in total PLUS medical check up) You can do all these only if she entered the country legally, otherwise you need to seek legal counsel.  This process will take approximately 6 monts; again, this is only if she entered the country legally and her visitor's visa is still current.  unemployed? yeah, that is a problem, you need to show that you are 110% above the poverty level, you might want to talk to some one who can "sponsor your wife" (form I864) go to www.USCIS.GOV and you can look for more info.  you can also google "immigration clinics, laywers etc) in your town, they can help you with this process.
AA11206283	Not going to happen. You need a job, the ability to support yourself financially and socially, a place to live, a plan for the court for conducting your life, usually your parents permission, and a court order.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	That's not being emancipated.

2irnNpMeaa	First of all, when a person becomes a criminal there are many factors involved in determining his rehabilitation.  But when a criminal is thrown into a cell and then learns survival of the fittest through other criminals then his odds of rehab back to society are extremely against him.  If one makes a "mistake" like many humans do then he should be given the opportunity for rehab and merger back to society.  Unfortunately the system has been designed for corporate greed and what's another criminal to them, just one more person who they can control and lock up!!|`|DBuXLzjLaa	i think most polititans,police,judges are criminals,ive been to prison lots of time and im a better person than all the above|`|AA10045620	It would depend on why/how they became a criminal.

AA10123414	To get emancipated, you will need to prove:  1. You are mature enough to manage your own affairs. This is demonstrated by things like a clean criminal record, good grades etc.  2. You can support yourself financially. You will need to show income and anticipated expenses.It is HIGHLY unlikely you have the income to rent an apartment, pay all utilities and put food on your table. You can NOT draw any public assistance if emancipated. The judge can rescind your emancipation if you go on public assistance after being emancipated.  3. That your welfare is better served by not being with your parents. Hating mom's rules will not meet this criteria.  4. That there are no other reasonable solutions to the issues at home.    In the states that actually allow emancipation you will need to be at least 16.    You will need to hire a lawyer to get you though the process.    You would need to file in a court that has jurisdiction over your parents or custodial parent if you do not live with both.     Only about 1 percent of emancipation petitions nationwide are granted.|`|AA11206283	First you need to live in a state that permits emancipation; not all do. You need a job, the ability to support yourself financially and socially, a place to live, a plan for the court for conducting your life, usually your parents permission, and a court order.    Can take a year and cost hundreds or more.

You change the diapers, of 2 or 3 years old boy and you see the nature is always there and reacting .do you know what that means? Is the    blueprint of our existence .how can you stop the natural instinct now how can I rate that is where Ill visit that we inherited, and   ignoring our urge. Is not possible? So the 21st century world we are smarter we are more advanced in everything plus sexuality and we do all that is essentially to satisfy our needs, and continue happier life. The female is no different   that the man. She will start wondering of what is all about. And eventually she  come to the point that shes missing something out of her life, and she star doing of what is born to  do .Oral sex is nothing moor than an Idea of a sexual prefers ,and  safe sex has nothing to do with the a joy men  or Germs  be   all over? That how I look at it.  But again is my opinion.|`|AA11702773	We think it is family business and not government business how children are taught this.|`|THRtsl83aa	So?

Look at Bristol Palin; she probably was a product of abstinence-only education.  It didn't stop her from having intercourse, but it surely stopped her from using contraception.  Even worse, some kids will engage in other sexual activity besides intercourse so they can claim they're still virgins.       Seeing as you have a link from "The Stranger," you may want to check Dan Savage's alternate definition for "saddleback."|`|senICpbVaa	Yes. I don't see the point in trying to force abstinence on kids. They're not have sex to rebel or say "take that, conservative weirdos", they're having sex because they're horny. So wouldn't it be more logical to teach them to, if they so choose and feel ready, to have sex using effective contraception methods. Generally, these "abstinence only" conservatives don't teach kids contraception at all (I had to sit through one in high school).

Leading people to believe that homo sapiens first evolved in Africa and then spread out from there.  Whether these people were black is hard to say.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	The first homo sapiens may have originated in west Africa, but that doesn't make them black.  The characteristics that make up race evolved in time after the dispersion of the early humans.  In all likelihood, they probably looked more like a cross between Arab and Kenyan than anything.  Skin was probably bronze colored, hair was probably dark, but not kinky.      But you're right, race should be irrelevant, but it's not to most people.  And many of those who proclaim the loudest that they are not racists actually do so because of their insulated lives and lack of contact with other groups.  The real non-racists are those who do have regular interaction with other races and can treat all based on merit or worthiness, not appearance.|`|2M9WZufyaa	I don't support New Zealand in rugby...

Think of all the people who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, all the Americans who are unemployed and losing their homes, all the added debt in the last 8 years because GW Bush simply was unable to admit he'd made a mistake.  Bush still can't admit his failure, even to himself.  I'm glad this is not a problem we'll have with Obama.  I think so far he's doing a good job.      And you probably wouldn't have liked him no matter what he did.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	You have been brain washed by the Bush administration. Arab's and Muslim's are not responsible for 9/11 and don't owe anyone an apology.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	It's not Arabs that caused increased security, it is terrorists, some of whom happen to be Muslim.|`|8Kmp90JDaa	He was apologizing to the Muslims in the Arab world who are NOT terrorists. He was apologizing to the Muslims in the Arab world who work hard and try to be good citizens, just like most of us here in America He was aplogizing to the over 6 million Muslims in OUR country, who have lived in fear of their house being randomly searched or their phone calls being listend to by government officials as a result of the Patriot Act, just because they're Arab or Muslim. Why was he apologizing? Because for the past 8 years the Bush administration treated them like dirt and created fear and paranoia of Muslims and Arabs.     The effects of Bush's fear mongering is still evident today. Just a few months ago, a Muslim family was taken off an Air Tran flight in Atlanta. Why? Because the Muslim woman asked where the safest seat is on the plane. A paranoid passenger told the flight crew it scared them, and they took them off the plane. A few months before that, a man was taken off a Jet Blue flight because he was wearing a shirt with Arabic writing on it. Bush's fear mongering has created paranoia and discrimination. Muslims from other parts of the world are afraid to visit this country, because they're afraid of how people will treat them here.|`|XoYaFgkyaa	Because his apology only means something to those who will accept it.    The type of change Obama wants in the middle east, won't come from him or any other American.  It will come from them.  They will have to decide to shun those particular groups of people whom you are talking about.    I personally don't think it will happen, but Obama apologizing, imo, doesn't hurt or help the situation.    Think about it this way.  Yeah, we went into Iraq for all the wrong reasons, but we are there now.  I don't see those people rising up and squelching these militant groups with our help.    So now Obama wants to go to Afghanistan.  It will be the same situation there.  They only want our help to help KILL the other people, they aren't interested in joining hands and "coming together" as a nation.  Thats American Culture, not theirs.  So it boils down to two choices.  Do you pick sides and help ethnically cleanse one group, or do you not have ANY part in it.    Its a different culture over there.  To ascribe the same philosophies of liberalism and individual freedom over there is to impose your culture on theirs.  Whether it be a republican philosophy, or a democratic philosophy.  We need to butt out of all that stuff, and let their people bring about their own freedom.    For an example, imagine if in America, there was a group of Baptists, who decided they wanted to cleanse the United States of all non-Baptist people.  We would never stand for that.  Those people would either be detained by our government or they would be met with aggression from other Americans.  Neither situation is occurring over there.  Their government allows them to kill each other and THEY take part in it as citizens.  They are doing it to themselves.    It would be like if the republicans took the side of the baptist and the democrats too the side of those who wanted to capture the baptists and restore the freedom.  Imagine the civil unrest that would cause.  That is essentially what has been happening over there for centuries.  The roots of hate are so deep, that no one from outside their culture is going to change that.  That change will only happen from within.    Did we let the tyranny of England hold us back?  No, and we only got help when WE decided to gain our freedom for ourselves.  That is the rule everywhere.  You can't BRING freedom to people, they have to fight for it.|`|mHdKANPNaa	He's a liberal appeaser. They run and embrace anyone who can be looked at as purged and apologizes for any harm done by the supposed "idiot" Americans. The only idiots are the ones that appease terrorists.|`|AA11963685	Obama knows that not all Muslims are extremists and not all Arabs are malcontents planning our demise.  God bless his intellectual well-educated little heart.  It does my own heart good to see an American stand up and declare that most Americans can tell the difference and are not their enemies.  It's the only way to begin to gain real help from both quarters to squash extremist terrorism.  They don't make any real effort to stop it because they don't feel they can trust us anymore than you are willing to trust any of them.  That has to change, and it seems Obama is the man to make that change happen.  There's that word again.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	I would rather strip at the airport than have my country invaded by another and have mine or my neighbours children blown up if I had the choice that is.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	because if you look at every country that has problems youll usually find that the US has been involved there at some point in the last 60 years|`|mmFz64MFaa	He prob mad a few sand people happy but the rest said shove it up your a@@|`|64SObnr5aa	He did not.

A tiny tiny minority of muslims are attacking america, but the arab world sometimes think that all of america hates them, i think he was apologizing to the ones which get caught up as "collateral damage" or whatever the euphemism is, so that they DON'T BECOME the next generation of attackers? I like this new tactic, it might just work.    That said i'm not really in favour of public apologies on behalf of the nation.

Our world trade center had been attacked once before 9-11 when the twin towers were finally demolished by al-qaeda operatives. Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas have been behind or involved in the majority of attacks against the USA, here at home or on foreign soil, since the early 1980's. The US Embassy Bombing in Beirut (1983, killed 80), the suicide truck bombing at the Marine barracks near the Beirut airport ( 1983, killed 241 marines ), the targeting of us troops in Yemen, Somalia,Spain, South America, not to mention the attack on the USS Cole and our pentagon. Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are talking about closing US bases and borders, posing a huge security burden on our troops in Afghanistan. These are just a few of the offenses perpetrated against America, and though we are not angels, neither are we devils. We, as a country, have done more to help secure the borders and work hand in hand with muslim countries to attain peace for their people than anyone in the world. True, muslims are not our enemies. Radical islam, producing dangerous terrorist groups supported by hierarchies and governments unfriendly to the USA, are. We have absolutely no reason to apologize to muslims. Like americans, muslims know the truth about where the trouble comes from and who their allies are. We don't want our weak-kneed politicians paying lip service to countries with no truth in their tounges. Lets take care of our securities, so that we have the resources once again to help other countries, like we always have.
nE95Hnn5aa	A proponent of "New Federalism," President Reagan wanted to adjust the roles of Federal and State governments to give the States greater authority. His State of the Union Address in 1982 proposed to turn back most of the Federal-aid highway program, except the Interstate System, and all transit programs to the States. However, the final bill, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982, continued strong Federal involvement in both programs. Responding to the growing infrastructure crisis, the legislation increased the gasoline tax by a nickel, the first increase since 1959.

Oh1Hi8iMaa	Wells Fargo never needed the money.  If they really are giving it back it's just because they took so much crap lately over their "Vegas Vacation".|`|dJnRFpWWaa	But this is what companies do with capital. They don't lend it all, particularly not in this economic environment. They don't spend it all on bonuses or jets either. They acquire other companies that add value to their company because they fit their business strategy. Then they pretty much fire everyone who had been employed in the just acquired company whose position has now become redundant, which is counterproductive activity in a recession from the government's point of view.    But this is how companies grow, or position themselves for future growth, in this kind of market environment. They scavenge for growth opportunities among the weakened, who have no such access to government capital, because it makes good sense to do so from their perspective.    I think the Wells Fargo repayment is directly related to the negative publicity from the corporate outing in Las Vegas. If I was the CEO, I don't think I would have done something in a city as notorious for pleasures of the flesh as Las Vegas. But businesses have always used these sorts of select events to reward employees and will continue to do so. Companies that received TARP money probably shouldn't sponsor Girls Gone Wild-type events with those funds, but we can't go all Queen Victoria on them either.|`|493063d6139840a25805427e0c89ce9aaa	Wells Fargo has just acquired Wachovia Securities.

And that guy was the quintessential Conservative.  He pressed for lower taxes, and succeeded in getting them.  And when California could not afford its spending on those taxes, he cut spending.  And when it ran into trouble again, he cut spending again.    And when it ran into trouble again, he cut spending even further.  He finally started cutting into things like education and police, things that even Republicans like to spend on.  And still they couldn't take in enough because taxes were too low and they couldn't cover even the necessities.  And so Schwarzenegger cut the necessities.    And they still couldn't make it.  The budget collapsed and the state governement of California went into severe debt.  What was once one of the richest states in the nation had fallen into immense trouble.  Finally Schwarzenegger accepted that cutting taxes doesn't work if you can't cut spending, and he had to turn into a "liberal fraud" overnight.      Which means he had to do what it takes to save the budget, and raise taxes because tax cuts don't work.  So if being a "fraud" is the only way to keep the economy afloat, then thank God Arnold is smart enough to see that.  Just wish he saw it sooner.              You want Liberal?  Try Sarah Palin.

The only difference is that we expect other countries, China, to loan us the money.  With the size of our National Debt, we have become a "High Risk" borrower.  That means that the interest rate will probably increase in order for investors to carry our paper.  Same as you if you borrow too much and may have trouble repaying, your interest increases.    If our interest increases on our debt, then you will see all interest rates increase.  The next step, assuming that the economy begins to recover, will be increased taxes.  Believe it, it's around the corner.  Also, with so much money in the market, inflation is sure to follow.  This is what happened with housing.  The gov. pushed lenders to loan money.  The demand caused housing to inflate, unrealistically.  With default of so many loans, the bubble burst.

The key is your question "If no wealth is added as total dollars in circulation double or triple, can the currency crash?"    Yes, adding Wealth to the system will stimulate the economy. But the "package" only adds funny money to the system. (Pay to play bribes and payback time, here.)    This will lead to hyper-inflation.    Re:FDR --- Raising taxes --- like many States are doing, and protectionism --- are a sure fire way to keep this crisis going for years to come. Both these are ploys to keep the unions happy and well fed with the confiscated earnings of little guys in the private sector.

In order for the government to pay for all of this, The Fed must print millions and millions of dollars of new money. This weakens the dollar significantly. The already weak dollar will become even weaker and could plummet. Think hyperinflation. Also, the U.S. will be forced to continue to borrow billions of dollars from countries overseas. The whole things spells disaster if you really think about it deeply. But our financial system was severely flawed even before this economic slide. Our whole system is based on debt as money and fractional lending. In other words, our system is based on the idea of imaginary money that never even existed in the first place.

Continental currency was a paper currency issued by the Continental Congress, after the Revolutionary War began in 1775. Eric P. Newman, a leading authority on the early paper money of America, distinguishes between Continental Currency, issued by the authority of the Continental Congress, Colonial currency, issued by the colonies before the revolution, and state currency, issued after the Declaration [though many collectors lump together state and colonial issues and refer to both as Colonial Currency]. [Continental currency was denominated in dollars [from 1/6 of a dollar to $80, including many odd denominations in between], while Colonial currency was denominated in pounds, shillings, and pence, as well as in dollars.] With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving voice to the phrase "not worth a continental".    The painful experience of the runaway inflation and collapse of the Continental dollar prompted the delegates to the Constitutional Convention to include the gold and silver clause into the United States Constitution so that the individual states could not issue bills of credit.|`|DibFrwxlaa	If the government gets carried away with itself and simply injects currency willy-nilly, than inflation can increase.

But the bailouts are a huge mistake. The financial 'wizards' and corporate 'geniuses' have made a lot of bad decisions. Giving them more money to play with isn't the answer. They have already wrecked several companies and severely damaged many more with their actions.     Your teenage son wrecks the car doing things he shouldn't have been doing. What do you do? Do you give him another car? Do you give him another car but put a lot of restrictions on him until he proves he's responsible? OR, do you say you can keep your drivers liscense, but you aren't going to let him drive your car?     Increasing money in circulation with out adding backing is what causes inflation. Look at what happened during Carter's time.    The big thing that made the crash of '29 so bad was Hoover and Congress said they needed to balance the budget and increased taxes to pay for government programs and keep the budget balanced.    Most of FDR's WPA, CCC, and other programs really accomplished little. But it did give people a sense of worth. WW2 did more to get us out of the Depression than anything else did. OBTW WW2 almost broke this country financially which is one reason Truman dropped the Bomb.     My hope is that Congress fianlly realizes that excessive spending of money that couldn't be afforded caused the problems we have today. Spending more won't solve the problem. When you have dug yourself into a hole and you want to dig your way out? The first thing you have to do is stop digging deeper.    But agree with you. Bush should have not asked for the bailout and Congress should have never approved it. It is proving bad for the economy and for everyone else.|`|VfBaveaJaa	I believe that we will all pay dearly for all these bailouts and the dollar will shrink.

What's more, the most influential economist of the last century, John Maynard Keynes, hated the gold standard with astonishing intensity, and he considered it his great accomplishment in life to have assisted in its destruction. Even to this day, his influence is immense, with most economists accepting the broad framework that he laid out in his work, and sharing his conviction that the worst thing that could befall any society is for the government to lose its power to manage economic life.    Why do the government and its partisans dislike the gold standard? It removes the discretionary power of the Fed by placing severe limits on the ability of the central bank to inflate the money supply. Without that discretionary power, the government has far fewer tools of central planning at its disposal. Government can regulate, which is a function of the police power. It can tax, which involves taking people's property. And it can spend, which means redistributing other people's property. But its activities in the financial area are radically curbed.     Think of your local and state governments. They tax and spend. They manipulate and intervene. As with all governments from the beginning of the time, they generally retard social progress and muck things up as much as possible. What they do not do, however, is run huge deficits, accumulate trillions in debt, reduce the value of money, bail out foreign governments, provide endless credits to failing enterprises, administer hugely expensive and destructive social insurance schemes, or bring about immense swings in business activity.    State and local governments are awful and they must be relentlessly checked, but they are not anything like the threat of the federal government. Neither are they as arrogant and convinced of their own infallibility and indispensability. They lack the aura of invincibility that the central government enjoys.    It is the central bank, and only the central bank, that works as the government's money machine, and this makes all the difference.    Once you begin to understand the role of the monetary regime in the building of the modern statist enterprise  in providing the means of funding for the entire welfare-warfare state, in generating financial instability, in destroying savings and undermining living standards  you realize that there is far too little interest in the subject in the mainstream press. You begin to realize that the 19th century focus on the money issue was entirely appropriate.     Once having read Mises or Rothbard or any number of great monetary theorists, you begin to realize that understanding the monetary regime is the key that unlocks the mysteries of political control in our time. The Fed was created not to scientifically manage the economy  as the journals claimed at the time  but because it met the institutional needs of both the government and the banking industry. The government sought a means of finance that didn't depend on taxation, and the banking industry sought what Rothbard called a cartelization device. That is to say, the banking industry was seeking some way to prevent competitive pressures between banks from limiting their ability to expand credit.     Well, the central bank fit the bill. A central bank managing a currency that is not tied to anything real fits the bill even better. If a little power to inflate is good for the government and its connected banking and financial interests, a lot of power to inflate is even better. For this reason, it was very likely that the gold standard could not have survived the creation of a central bank, and, for the same reason, the creation of a new gold standard will have to do away with the central bank that would always threaten to bring it down.     The power to create money is the most ominous power ever bestowed on any human being. This power is rightly criminalized when it is exercised by private individuals, and even today, everyone knows why counterfeiting is wrong and knavish. Far fewer are aware of the role of the federal government, the Fed, and the fiat dollar in making possible the largest counterfeiting operation in human history, which is called the world dollar standard. Fewer still understand the connection between this officially sanctioned criminality and the business cycle, the rise and collapse of the stock market, and the continued erosion of the value of the dollar.    In fact, I would venture to guess that a sizeable percentage of even educated adults would be astounded to discover that the Federal Reserve does more than manage the nation's money accounts, that, in fact, its main activity consists in actually creating money that distorts production and creates inflation and the business cycle. In fact, I would go further to suggest that many educated adults believe that gold continues to serve as the ultimate backing of our monetary system, and would be astonished to discover that o|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	Our money is going to be ruined not alone by the bailouts,  but by the rampant corruption and collusion of the filth we call our government.  And unless we rein them in hard in a big rush, we will have no real alternative than to watch our country go down the tubes.  He//, our dollar is worth less than a quarter now, thanks to the Federal Reserve and our greedy politicians, and they have no plans to give us any kind of breaks any time soon.  Our problem is not just the bailouts, it is the arrant inflation of the government itself, and their plan for the subjugation of the American people..  Doubt it?  The best way to get us under the thumb is to slam us with a major economic failure, wreck our ability to support ourselves, and then offer to step in and save us all.  With our own freaking money, if it needs to be said!  Sound familiar?  If it doesn't, you must have slept through the last half of 2008 and the first two months of 2009.  Pay no attention to the fact that said money is not going to the working people who are being asked to pay it, but to the people who helped elect Obama, and who helped to make the economic problems we are now suffering.  Some save, huh?  Won't do any of us a bit of good, except those who already aren't paying taxes, and in fact, it won't do them any good, either.  If you're smart, but not smart enough to oust those crooks you elected, put those few bucks they leave you in land--buying low.  And that way, you'll at least have a plot to be buried in.  Do any of you remember when Nikita Kruschev promised to bury us?  Obama's working on it, in just his first two weeks of his unConstitutional presidency.  So, be smart and buy land upon which you can grow your own food, that you can hold and resell, if anyone can afford to buy it in the future.  Nothing but gold, silver or land will be worth squat within two years, unless Obama and the Dems are quelled, and with extreme prejudice, before 2010.

Rarely do I consider the CEO's compensation package.  Whether he or she keeps large bonuses for the top brass only, or has a more profit sharing approach among the employees is really not in my consideration.  Basic economics show that the best quality product at the best value will produce the best results.  If that means the CEO earns a $20 trillion dollar bonus then I'm cool with that.  But when the government goes into my paycheck (that I work VERY hard for) and takes money to support businesses under the assumption that this is required to keep these companies, thus the US economy afloat, then it becomes my prerogative.  If you claim that you cannot survive without government intervention, then award massive bonuses (despite the fact that your business is failing), then you are a fraud and should be regulated.  If your company is succeeding OR you are surviving the rough economy like everybody else because you anticipated needing a financial cushion...then you can pay your CEOs whatever you want.  I'm all for capitalism....and I'm all for helping out those in need.

It is a huge catch 22, really.  I think that the government is right in demanding that the money given to the failing banks be used to save the bank, not pay out bonuses for failing.  Most get bonuses for success.  Where did they earn their bonus?    I know they are contractual, but the reason for that is taxes.  They pay a different tax on it if it is a bonus than if it is payroll.  THAT is why they do it.  For a tax break.

Look it up, I did.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	Nope, Barney Frank and Chris Dodd are doing just fine....|`|XuLVfj1caa	They are not poor at all.  But the sad thing is this idea that these folks are using Bailout Money for bonuses.  These folks don't get regular salaries like the average person does.  They make the bulk of their money on bonuses and they have contracts.  I sympathize the the taxpayers who see these guys making millions of dollars while many of us struggle, but this is how they are paid.  Many of them work on commissions, many work on smaller salaries with heavy bonuses.  They get their bonuses when they make their numbers.  Just because a company loses money doesn't mean that employees missed their contractual obligations and budget numbers which are rewarded with bonuses.      But again, I do understand the mindset of the taxpayer.  But the fact is, these people signed contracts, and they did what was asked of them and they deserve to be paid their salaries (which include bonuses.)      However, these companies should have some sense of public responsibility and tone down some of these practices or at least defer some of these practices so that they would not draw the public scrutiny they've incurred.      I see both sides of the issue.  The President has handled this so it will no longer be a distraction from the business at hand.

They have sharp shooters go out and shoot bear, deer, mountain lions etc etc etc.     1 is to control the population.    2 is so the animals do no interact with the humans  3 to control disease.

They're vicious.  They kill for sport and they aren't afraid of anything.  The gov't "reintroduced" the wolf to our state.  Not even the wolves that were native here, but the bigger, badder breed.

This effect was shown in Yellowstone after wolf re-introduction.    Predators are indicators of healthy ecosystems

Democrats are also, too big to fail, I guess.    He is not serious about terrorists or terrorism.  Liberals do not see it as a National Security issue.  They see it as a Criminal Justice issue.  That is a dangerous flaw.    The Criminal Justice System is designed to prosecute criminals after the fact and under the assumption that fear of imprisonment is a deterrent.  They did not learn otherwise on 9/11.  This approach will cost us, dearly.    *
9ZnllFB8aa	I imagine Israel striking or blasting Iran's nuclear facilities thus upsetting Muslim's all over the the middle east.

u23sBafTaa	Well the electric and hybrid cars are not practical in many areas of America, we don't all life in an urban setting !  If you don't live in the city in the heartland they just aren't going to save any money.  I have talked to my car dealer about it.  They told me that they weren't practical for the way we use our vehicles.  They are going to have to come up with something different.  One of the problems here is the deer population if you are driving these  little cars and hit a big deer which we have an abundance of in Illinois, the death rate from traffic accidents will sky rocket !  They can total a SUV or a full size truck!    Well you basically told me what I was tellling you we do hunt deer here on a regular basis all fall and into the winter.  But it is rural America we have corn fields along the interstates, we also have coyotes the size of large dogs that we hunt as well. They still aren't practical for the distance that rural amercians drive to work !  I drive a jeep my husband drives a full size truck, americans in the heratland won;t give up their pickups and suvs.|`|U50orfPhaa	We aren't waiting - there is no global warming- its a myth- Al Gore made it up to make his 10million!    Notice he flies jets and has a HUGE boat etc. HUGE house that uses more energy than over 200 small homes use combined! The guy is a con-artist!   The ice is THICKER in the Artic- his photos were FAKES- said this is what the future holds-BS!  We have more oil here than the ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST has!    The only bad thing is gas will probably be about 10-15.00 a gallon with the Democrats in charge now.    Thats why I would buy an electric car.      Right though about one thing- a bail-out to auto industry won't last very long, especially when inflation comes soon and TAX HIKES!  We will be lucky to have food on our tables..|`|sVym9MjFaa	I just bought a 2009 Toyota Camry sooooooo it will be about 20 more years before I buy another new car|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	That must be why the top 2 best selling vehicles last year were full size pickups.  Also, zero of the top 10 were hybrids or any other high efficiency vehicle.     I don't want an all electric vehicle, because there's no way to charge it in the same time that you can refill a tank of gas.  Hydrogren has potential, but the auto industry is involved with that.  GM has been working on hydrogen vehicles. There's just no market because there are almost no locations in the US to fill up at if you drive a hydrogen vehicle.    Give me an all electric car that has a range of maybe 800-1000 miles on a charge and I'd think about it. But you'd still need to make sure that hotels have charging outlets to charge overnight. Even then I'd be concerned about batteries losing their charge capacity over time or simply during very cold weather.|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	And who is going to build these electric or hydrogen vehicles whenever the technology becomes available if all the auto manufacturers go out of business?    Edit  1:   Okay, if these cars exist, where are they?  I don't doubt there are a few prototypes around, but why aren't they being mass produced right now if the demand is anywhere near what you think it is?  I'll tell you, it's either because they're too damned expensive or they have no access to a mass production facility like the Big 3 do.  The Big 3 can solve the mass production problem if we keep 'em alive long enough, but deep down, I'm afraid the expense is what's really killing these things.  I couldn't afford a $50,000 car before the economy went to hell.    Edit  2:  While I agree there's no guarantee GM and Chrysler will survive with the bailout, it's a given that they'll fail without it.  Do you really want Ford to be the last man standing, so to speak?  Try getting a deal on a hybrid, or anything else for that matter, then!  We need the competetion if we're going to have a chance of getting affordable cars in the future, no matter what they run on.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Do you think electric cars will not cause harm to the environment?|`|p8ahZa8iaa	Well who's going to make these new cars?     You want to let the Europeans and Asians completely dominate that market?    We have to keep the American companies afloat with the condition that they use some of this bailout money on researching and developing alternative technology.|`|TtVMlVkbaa	Bail them out with the condition they break away from gasoline and change over to the new hybrids within a time line.  2 birds, 1 stone.
TFdKrkP2aa	It is time to stop trying to police the world.|`|84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	I doubt if there is anything like 'global terrorism'.  Terrorism tend to be mostly local and tribal.  In the case of the west vs. 'Islam' there are several moving parts that are rarely discussed.  For over a hundred years western interests have involved themselves in the middle east....mainly because that's where the oil is.  Though trillions of dollars have been transfered from the west to various middle east thugocracies, little of that wealth has gone to enhance the welfare of the people that live there.  In addition, the west has installed and abetted these thugocracies, thugs that have used or attempted to use the power of their secret police and the influence of religion to keep their people in line.  The thugs of course have never used the income from their oil to better the lives of the people they rule.  As in Mexico, a few families own pretty much everything.  These days, some of these thugocracies, to maintain their hold over their ever expanding and ever poorer subjects, have allowed private groups to attack western institutions using oil money to finance these acts of violence....classic 'blame the other guy for your problems BS'.  Other groups simply want an end of western influence in their affairs and some groups are simply wedded to violence as a way of life.      The US, to get out from under all this mess needs to exit the middle east ASAP, stop importing middle east oil and thereby stop financing these terrorist organization.  The second half of this is to treat these groups as criminal organizations and go after them as we would any other mafia.  Worst case, any thug government that supports these organizations should pay a price,  terrorism can cut both ways, though more than likely they would roll over for a bribe.  The concept of going to war to teach these characters the thrill of 'democracy', a foreign concept to the middle east, has proven to be the wrong thing to do.  Totally changing the equation by exiting the middle east and cutting off their cash flow is the right thing to do.  The Oil Mafia hates that idea....so it probably won't happen!|`|mmFz64MFaa	terrorist wont be in the future but our role in world politics who knows ima live in space|`|PnmvsKqBaa	With Obama as are president, we will most likely invite Muslim kids to are Universities.

I'm rather hoping that BHO's background in moderate Islam - living in Indonesia for a hwile, having some Muslim family background on his dad's side - will help him quit your failing Crusiad.

It was never there before and was put in during our more darker, less-enlightened days when there was a communist around every corner.

ATCodK2vaa	The mortgage companies/banks lobbied Congress to make it easier to give out loans and mortgages to people who couldn't afford it--not the other way around.    "Sub-prime lending is a fancy financial term for high-interest loans to people who would otherwise be considered too risky for a conventional loan. These include middle-class families who have accumulated too much debt and low-income working families who want to buy a home in the inflated housing market. To cover their risk, lenders charge such borrowers higher-than-conventional interest rates. Or they make "adjustable rate" loans, which offer low initial interest rates that jump sharply after a few years. Only a decade ago, sub-prime loans were rare. But starting in the mid-1990s, sub-prime lending began surging; these loans comprised 8.6 percent of all mortgages in 2001, soaring to 20.1 percent by 2006. Since 2004, more than 90 percent of the sub-prime mortgages came with exploding adjustable rates.     With interest rates low, housing prices on a steady rise, and practically no government regulation, mortgage finance companies devised high-interest, high-fee schemes to entice families to take out loans that traditional savings banks would not make. Many of the lenders were legitimate operations providing a market for credit-risky people. But there also were huge corporations, such as Household Finance, that sought extraordinary profits through unsavory means, called predatory loans. Not subject to government regulation, they bent the rules, lowering normal banking standards.     Mortgage brokers, the street hustlers of the lending world, often used mail solicitations and ads that shouted, "Bad Credit? No Problem!" "Zero Percent Down Payment!" to find people who were closed out of homeownership, or homeowners who could be talked into refinancing. They seduced millions of people into signing on the dotted line. Although sub-prime lending has been concentrated in minority and low-income urban areas, it has spread to the middle-class suburbs.     The sub-prime lenders didn't hold on to these loans. Instead, they sold them -- and the risk -- to investment banks and investors who considered these high interest rate, sub-prime loans a goldmine. By 2007, the sub-prime business had become a $1.5 trillion global market for investors seeking high returns.    Who Benefited and Who Got Hurt?     Mortgage brokers, who occupy an unregulated niche of the lending world, made a commission for every borrower they handed over to a mortgage lender. These brokers are like the drug dealers on the street corner. They are the smallest link in a lending chain that includes some of the largest and most respectable Wall Street firms.     Large mortgage finance companies and banks made big bucks on sub-prime loans. Last year, 10 lenders -- Countywide, New Century, Option One, Fremont, Washington Mutual, First Franklin, RFC, Lehman Brothers, WMC Mortgage, and Ameriquest -- accounted for 59 percent of all sub-prime loans, totaling $284 billion.     Wall Street investment firms set up special investment units, bought the sub-prime mortgages from the lenders, bundled them into "mortgage-backed securities," and for a fat fee sold them to wealthy investors around the world. According to The New York Times, China's second-largest bank, Bank of China Ltd, held almost $9.7 billion of securities backed by U.S. sub-prime loans. These investors, who bought the collateralized securities, were happy as long as they got paid their higher interest on the bonds or other investments."|`|oVmGcRVtaa	The government does not mandate to private business, other than regulations, and there is no regulation that tells banks they have to lend money to anyone.|`|m0muVAXfaa	well, I was going to answer this but I can not improve on dumdum's answer.

AA12212403	All presidents have had certain privileges, but none quite so public as our present oval office occupant (not my president).  Yet, what hurts is that he is having those lavish events and steak dinners while so many of us are hurting.  In a good economy, it wouldn't bother me, but right now I'm not happy at all.  He should have made a point of serving chicken and no frills to try to sell his pork bill, or more appropriate, perhaps, a pork dinner?  : )  I get resentful about things like private jets, but any president should have one, I guess.  But, not Pelosi.  I was very upset to think she had one and she is the least deserving of all.  I find her very offensive and giving her perks is so bothersome to me.  Like Prince Charles, I think lots of our officials should be flying on commercial jet liners who already have destinations and schedules.  His position is that he doesn't want to increase greenhouse gasses.  One would think liberals would have that kind of interest and concern.  Practice what you preach!  I'll bet if there was a survey of who had more private jets, democrats would probably have more.    Obama's Super Bowl party really ticked me off as well.  How dare he spend our money of frivolous things.  It's not the time.  So, as he puts caps on salaries of CEOs who got bail out money, as should he be capping his own party boy star studded events.  To think, he's only been in office days vs. even a month and he's hosted all these events.  I'm disgusted.|`|AA11103371	The president controls the Nukes.

L'immigrazione  una grande opportunit e risorsa per il paese che va sfruttata ricorrendo a tolleranza e giustizia.  Se l'impero romano avesse trattato i barbari emigrati all'interno dell'impero con rispetto, sarebbe oggi ancora in piedi. I Goti ad esempio chiesero ospitalit ai Romani nel 271, i romani la concessero, i Goti valicarono il Danubio e si stanziarono al confine dell'impero come foederati, ovvero alleati che dovevano proteggere il confine. Senonch i Romani non diedero ai Goti i viveri necessari e li lasciarono morire di fame, cos i Goti si rivoltarono e batterono ad Adrianopoli i romani, che per la prima volta vennero sconfitti in una battaglia difensiva all'interno dei confini dell'impero.  Un secolo pi tardi i goti arrivarono a saccheggiare roma e due secoli dopo, caduto l'impero, distrussero completamente la civilt Romana.   Morale della storia? se ci comportiamo con intolleranza oggi in difesa della nostra cultura, domani la nostra cultura sar paradossalmente cancellata.

Magari dovremmo anche sfavorire il crimine creando posti di lavoro, naturalmente non bisogna nemmeno trattare gli immigrati con riguardi maggiori altrimenti verranno commesse ingiustizie. Naturalmente, come in tutte le cose, non bisogna eccedere nemmeno in tolleranza,poi dire che che gli indiani si sono fatti assoggettare dagli Americani e i Tedeschi da Hitler perch troppo tolleranti  come dire Luigi XVI ha posto il collo sulla ghigliottina perch tollerante nei confronti dei rivoluzionari.|`|96322b5daef4d5572d05b6858f10251daa	io penso che i giapponesi stiano "dimorto" bene a casa loro...    per il resto non ti rispondo neanche!|`|4585339e99b904401b6e4d52b08fe147aa	l'ho gi detto  pi volte che se le persone che vengono in italia lavorano e non delinquono non ci sono problemi  qualunque sia la loro nazionalit e la loro religione.  per quanto riguarda gli afroamericani sono cittadini degli stati uniti che provengono (non da adesso) dall'africa, quello che non capisco  se ti danno noia anche gli americani  o solo gli americani di colore.|`|0ac1e3ab432697e349379ac8dbd20464aa	senti bello il mondo cm l'hai descritto nn lo avrai mai!xk la gente ke vienne cerca solo di vivere e nn morire affamata da dov vengono ,ti appoggio se dicevi magari clandestini,nn regolari,ma detto cos ti riferisce a tutti anke ai onesti lavoratori e cio nn va bene....!almeno i buonisti sn + intelligenti almeno sanno ke nn si puo avere un paese senza immigrazione e quindi invece di stare a dire cazzate dle tipo:negri sparite.stranieri pezzi di .m.e.r.d.a.(nn mi riferisco a te ma ai razzisti di questo answer)pensano una soluzione x l'immigrazione clandestina,,ecc,,,|`|gFgbzux4aa	In effetti i "buonisti" sono irritanti: sembra che non si rendano conto della spiacevolissima realt con la quale dobbiamo fare i conti tutti i giorni.|`|mo7fDjpuaa	Allora se vuoi solo italiani chiama i nostri connazionali sparsi in giro per il mondo ma dai sveglia qst caxxate andavano bene 50 anni fa qnd noi italiani eravamo considerati gente di merda, mafiosa che portava malattie, puzzoni da evitare.Magari qlk tuo parente ha dovuto subire le stronzate che adesso tu scrivi sugli immigrati in Italia.

La morale della favola e' bella, ma non avete capito che va tutto bene il multi culti , e tutto ci, ma non il multi crimi, e non che alla fine tollerare l' intollerante, ti islamizzi senza neanche capirlo.  Perche allora puoi prendere tanti esempi di tolleranza che sono finiti male come appunto gli indiani d' America, che tollerando e credendo alla " pace" che gli era arrivata sul collo, era diventato schiavo ed eliminato come cultura.  La tolleranza bisogna sapere dove rivolgerla, perche se tolleri Hitler, caro, e' tardi poi,  per dire come hanno detto " noi, non sapevamo".  Non si tratta di razzismo ma di studiare certi fatti.  Stanno islamizzando , e stano appoggiando il crimine -donne torturate destinate alla prostituzione, - e quindi lasciate perdere, si allo straniero, no al manicomio.  Se questo per voi e' tollerare.....  contenti voi.........  io vi direi di prendere qualche esempio dagli arabi allora. Perche non lo fate?Visto che volete imparare qualcosa? Guardate come gestiscono l' immigrazione, e trovatemi uno sbaglio. Quindi sincerit, e non propaganda con falsit.  Ma perche parlate di tolleranza mentre si tratta del contrario?  Chi sa distinguere sa anche tollerare.  Chi non sa distinguere distrugge tutto, pensando di fare ordine.  Per il suo interesse di potere.  Bisogna sapere dare uno stop, per fino a questa sette. Di avere la poltrona.  Si a tutto, ma tutto, ha un limite. Quale e' il limite della sinistra?  Che fa venire qui tutti quelli che vogliono farvi un harem?

The answer therefore is yes, and yes it could be a republican government that does that, or a democratic one, or some other party in the future.

Politicians always want to spend money to improve their chances of getting reelected and to pay off any favors that they owe to the people that got them elected. Any excess money is always spent. Almost all government projects go overbudget and the government is so innefficient that the new capitol that would be raised would either go to paying interest or doing some other pet project to raise more money. If the current "stimulus bill" gets passed then we will see a dramamtic increase in government spending with a resulting increase in taxes, which will hurt the economy, which leads to more spending etc. The government is always trying to add new positions and take over new sectors of the economy so that people will become dependent on them for their livelihood and it will ensure they are reelected and the people can't live without the government.      A good quote with reference to an increasing government size is "The bureaucracy is expanding, to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy."|`|AA11757826	not any time soon, even Australia which has had a surplus for a while is heading "into the red" in this current mess.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	There is only one way.

She showed the whole country that she is a smart capable running mate during the VP debate. We seen her stand up against Biden, and she really knew what she was talking about. No one is perfect. And I am sorry, but maybe you should look a little more into Obama's past. I don't trust a man who for 20 years sat under a pastor that openly was anti-american, saying, and I quote, "God damn America", and instead of fighting for race equality, he supported race separation. Now that Obama has distanced himself from Jeremiah Wright it does not erase the previous 20 years of influence. Reverse racism is just as bad as the traditional racism. We need to be a united country. Obama is inexperienced and all he does is talk about hope and change because he doesn't really have anything else to say. He is preying on the voters who are desperate for a change during this difficult time. Sounds a lot like Hitler if you ask me. He has no solid issues or important things to talk about so instead he just points the finger to other people and mocks our troops. His supporters are like a cult....So yes I would be much more comfortable with Palin running this country than Obama-300%. |`|KAKXZw0Qaa	HEAVEN FORBID  NO PALIN NO HOW.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Oh, you mean Miss Liar of the Decade.

If I'm loaning you $100, most of the time I'm not going to care how you spend it.    If I'm loaning you $1,000, I'm going to be concerned if you're thinking about spending it all on a drinking binge at the local bar.    If I'm loaning you $1,000,000, I will be going with you to the bank, watching you spend the money, and if you try to waste it on some trip to Bora Bora, I will knock you out.    The taxpayers are loaning this money to the companies--it is not for the CEO's to throw some weekend kegger with hookers and all that. The government is loaning the money, so it has **every right** to say how its spent.    You don't want policies controlling wages?

Where do you come up with peanuts?    PS: You don't have to live in New York City. There is a lot of open country in this United States. I've lived in 5 different states and a lot of the moves were economic ones.    Why shouldn't the President make 400,000? The CEO's are limited to 500,000 - more than he makes but he does a much more important job. In my opinion he should have insisted on them being fired. Are they able to move from running the company in the ground to making a profit. Are they going to use the same tactics to run the company? How much can they change or better yet, will they change?|`|BKCLMSbNaa	Honestly, I care less.  There are millions of people who don't have jobs, and many others who do but aren't getting the pay they deserve.  Wall Street has taken the money we need, and spent it on their CEO's and employees on luxurious things.....they are not helping American citizens. And I highly doubt they will ever step up to the plate and give money out to people who need it most.     The first bailout didn't do much to help this economy, and was spent by the greedy morons. Why should we help Wall Street when it hasn't done a thing to help those who are in need? That's something to really think about.|`|1jNHDyaIaa	How about we just not give them a bail out. Then they will not have to worry!|`|lTyjk2Jpaa	The worst thing is that if a company takes the bail out money now the clause that is in the agreement that said the Government is now chief stock holder scares me .The Government can't run the Government, let alone a large corporation!|`|QJmc9jQpaa	you asked wrong question why does he make 400 thousand and cabint close to 100 thousand each and than put pay freeze he;'s a hypocryte.    to anwser question want to look good and tough while geitner got money from bailout is in his administration|`|axHyoVqGaa	Geithner and Frank are on record as saying this is something that should be applied to all CEO's regardless of whither their companies take bailout dollars or not.  I can't believe that Obama's thinking would be radically different.  Time will tell though.  However, I do think that this will hurt any company who takes bail out dollars.  Any CEO's worth their salt will avoid these companies like they were the plague.  Therefore these companies will only get the CEO's that no one else wants.  I don't see how that is conductive to saving the company.  The bottom line is that the government shouldn't have started bailing out these companies, period.  It's just an all around bad idea.

Este pas tiene mas personas que  son solidarios en su vida cotidiana, mas de lo que uno puede pensar (afortunadamente, yo he crecido, aprendido e imitado su proceder, de muchos de ellos), con sus vecinos.  Los polticos de verdad ni como ayudarlos, son la escoria de esta sociedad y un psimo ejemplo para las nuevas generaciones. Simplemente son parte de sociedades (por no decir pandillas), que buscan el poder y lo de que el emana, para su provecho personal y de grupo; el pas como tal es visto desde tiempos inmemorables como un gran botn que buscan afanosamente acabarselo en un lapso no mayor de seis a?os (medida de tiempo mgica de solapamiento, encubrimiento y impunidad total), ya que ahora con eso de la  democracia , puede que no vuelvan a quedar (para eso esta el plan  B , o sea; hacerse de una curul para tener fuero por si las dudas UFF!!!), la madurez poltica de la sociedad tambin tiene su lado malo, a su entender.  Un saludo|`|l5pImp8iaa	Indudablemente los polticos representan a la perfeccin al pueblo que gobiernan, as como los hay buenos los hay malos, y todos sabemos de qu hay ms. En fin, el da en que Mxico deje de ser tercermundista es el da en que puedas dejar tu cartera con dinero olvidada en tu escuela, en tu oficina o en tu propia casa y la encuentres donde la dejaste y no le falte nada. Basta de acusaciones al exterior, primero lo primero, uno mismo, luego su entorno cercano y luego nos preocupamos por quin nos gobierna.  Saludos.|`|MUROgWtWaa	Solo ve cuando vas en la calle manejando o caminando cauntas personas respetan las se?ales de transito como altos lugares de estasionamieno o cruzar caminando por las ezquinas o esperar a que el semafor este en verde cuntos tiran basura en la calle y cuantos realmente dan el asiento a una mujer o a una ansiana. Yo pienso que este pais cambiara cuando todos seamos mas educados y consientes con nuestros progimos y respetar como queremos que nos respeten. Solo piensa si algien llega y tira basura en tu casa como lo vas criticar pero tu si lo tira en la calle cuantas veses te levantas buscando la forma de faltar a trabajar asi somos y cuando cambiemos este pais sera mejor el mejor del mundo tenemo para eso y mucho mas|`|yAdHc9FLaa	estoy de acuerdo, es una cultura que se ha formado desde hace mucho tiempo|`|KwTCg4uBaa	Si claro, los polticos tambin son ciudadanos, y reflejan muchos patrones culturales, lamentablemente la mayora negativos, de los mexicanos; pero esto es en todo los sistemas de tipo representativo, lo deseable es que se preocuparan mas en lo que los electores necesitan y no de lucrar con la representacin de la gente, pero la realidad nos indica que por el momento, y la estructura de los poderes en Mxico, esto es una utopa, porque los servidores pblicos de mas alto nivel creen ser reyes electos, y no servidores de la nacin, y nada mas basta ver sus elevados sueldos y prestaciones para confirmar que no corresponden a la realidad del pas, y me atrvera a decir que tampoco a la historia de sus polticos, hay muy pocos de ellos que se merecen en realidad las grandes ventajas, rentas y comisiones de sus cargos, y no de ahora, sino desde hace mucho.|`|R6TUe0O4aa	Sin duda asi es.    Obviamente no se puede generalizar para todos, porque hay gente que siempre ve primero por el pais, no compran nada importado, ayudan muchisimo a cuidar el medio ambiente, etc. Pero el grueso de la poblacion si piensa lo que mencionaste del que no tranza no avanza, tan simple como que no vivimos en un pais de primer mundo; ya que si la gente no pensara asi no viviriamos en nuestras actuales condiciones, ya que no nos podemos quejar de falta de cerebros, recursos economicos o naturales.     Si la gente es corrupta y no le interesa en general el bien social, como los politicos podrian ser diferentes, ya que sin duda son parte de esta sociedad y comparten la misma cultura. Cada pueblo tiene el gobierno que se merece.    Saludos.

Aqu en Venezuela tenemos el precio de gasolina ms barato del mundo 0,8$cent.    As que cualquier incremento de precio en los alimentos solo se justifica por la especulacin y la avaricia del sector empresarial privado, solo les impoprta llenarse los bolsillos a costa del hambre del pueblo.    A toda costa estos tipos tratan de desestabilizar la gestin del presidente.

En parte se debe a que en nuestro pas hay muy poca produccin agrcola y pecuaria, y la que hay no es manejada de manera eficiente.     Por otro lado, la cadena de comercializacin es larga, compleja y llena de roscas. Desde el momento en que la leche es orde?ada hasta que llega envasada a nuestros hogares ha pasado por tantas manos y cada una busca su ganancia. Eso sin contar con los altos costos de seguridad que deben incurrir nuestros ganaderos y comerciantes para que no los maten.    Si hablemos de los alimentos importados, debemos tener en cuenta el control de cambio desde hace 5 a?os. Los cupos de CADIVI son solo para las empresas inscritas en EMPREVEN.

En Venezuela  se ha destruido el aparato productivo, persiguiendo  toda empresa  que funcione, invadiendo las fincas , destruyendo las plantaciones y persiguiendo a los peque?os  hacendados, ganaderos o agricultores a travs de los brazos  delicuenciales de la robolucin ( guerrillas bolivarianas), porque la idea es que  todos  ( excepto la banda militar que gobierna) seamos  miserables para que dependiendo  del gobierno nos puedan colocar un BOZAL de arepas.  ?Por que estamos QUEMANDO  divisas?, porque al comprar  alimentos ( que antes producamos) en el exterior estamos cambiando un recurso natural no renovable , como es el petrleo por  recursos que cada da crecen y se multiplican, como el ganado, o el arroz, el maz o los granos.

Todo lo hacen para generar malestar en la gente. Es otra manera de implementar sus Guarimbas, pero la gente lo sabe y no les para.     Adems, la principal empresa productora de alimentos para animales, una empresa privada del grupo Polar, escasea la distribucin a nivel nacional, desde hace ms de seis meses, lo cual genera prdidas y baja produccin de esos rubros. Los productos del mar, siempre han sido caros y la distribucin limitada porque prefieren vender a otros pases que pagan en euros o dlares.    LA INMMENSA MAYORA, SI COME COMPLETO y no como el forista informa, PORQUE ASISTE A MERCAL Y A PEDEVAL. Tienen paciencia para hacer sus colas y comprar alimentos subsidiados por el Estado..... No les queda otra.    Mientras los inversores polticos-privados dominen el mercado y se presten para molestar, ms hambre pasaremos, no slo en Venezuela sino en otros pases.

En este orden ha dilapidado millones de dolares, que si hubiesen sido invertidos en el pas en la produccin de bienes y servicios, y en fortalecimiento de la economa nacional, (otra seria la situacin) sin embargo ha actuado como el mejor de los gobiernos capitalistas, ha puesto en practica el  control de cambio desde hace mas de 5 a?os y a la economa de puerto ( como tiene dolares compra todo en el exterior) que ya se ejecuto en el gobierno de Carlos Andrs Perez, as que ahora le compran a pases a los cuales les estn ayudando a salir avante en sus economas, mientras en Venezuela, no hay trabajo formal, sino por que hay cada da mas buhoneros, por que se va la gente joven a otros lugares y por que las ciudades estn invadidas por la inseguridad, la basura y la mendicidad y el desaliento de una poblacin a quien el gobierno revolucionario le ha fallado estrepitosamente.|`|Ad365PlAaa	Dejando de lado las tonteras sobre la especulacin, el acaparamiento y esas paparruchas pienso que el problema se debe al poco fomento de la produccin por parte de los gobiernos y especialmente del que sufrimos desde hace 10 a?os que no quiere que los particulares produzcan nada y quiere importarlo todo...    Sin embargo, no pienso que la comida est mucho ms cara que en otros pases. Tal vez en Caracas s sea cara y se consigue poco, pero en el interior hay mayor surtido, incluso de productos industriales, y a un precio ms asequible... Una vez hace poco estaba almorzando con dos personas en el mercado de un pueblo del interior, comimos de todo, y al pedir la cuenta me asombr al ver lo barato que haba salido el condumio y le pregunt a la mujer si no estaba equivocada, sta se asust y me repregunt ?Porqu, le parece muy caro? Yo me sonre, pagu y le dej una buena propina...     Ms que de sueldos mnimos se necesita mas bien un aumento general de sueldos y salarios, pero para evitar la inflacin depredadora se necesita tambin producir ms, mucho y mejor...    Por otra parte, y sin nimo de polmica ?Dime en qu parte del mundo que no sea USA o Europa una maestra jubilada puede comer carne todos los das?

US intervention anywhere leads to worse living conditions and more poverty. castro is a great man and cubans love him. as much as the US makes him out to be evil i find it hard to find a man whos given his people free education, free health care (ranked higher than the US) etc. was funny though. he was pro west at first and the US just shunted him. he only comes down hard on those who are sent by the US to destroy him and Cuba. capitalist pigs in other words. viva castro and viva la revolution|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Well, given the growing levels of corruption, gambling and prostitution in Cuba under Batista, I'd say yes.  If Castro had never led the uprising, then Las Vegas wouldn't exist. It's only because of Cuba closing its many casinos that lead to an alternative being needed.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	I think that's a good point. Well we'll never know will we because the Cuban people resisted against the imperial USA but I think giving the proximity of Haiti to the US and Cuba to the US there is a strong argument that if the US had managed to meddle in Cuban affairs Cuba would certainly be in a worse state than it is.|`|64SObnr5aa	The problem in Cuba was the capitalists had free rein and left the economy and people in economic ruin with a vast poor class, no middle class and a few very rich people.  That is the problem with uncontrolled capitalism (totally free market system), it invites revolutions.    Castro delivered, the rich Cubans fled and set up their hate groups in Florida living off the Cuban treasury that they emptied leaving Cuba destitute.  They single handed turned our country against Castro, after Castro made overtures to Washington.    Cuba turned socialistic with an authoritarian government.    The rest is history.    Today Cuba is slowly turning capitalistic, but is largely socialistic today.  Time will tell how far they will go.    Capitalism can be a very good thing, but it needs very strong controls to work in poor countries like Haiti.  Obviously that is not happening and why, if I had a choice of living in Haiti or Cuba, there is no question in my mind I would prefer Cuba.    Peace  Jim    .|`|nfZHMuxlaa	I always said , "its better to run your own Damn business " , Timmy .|`|mmFz64MFaa	cuba gets help from our enemies haiti dont     and cuba has a shi load of american junk|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	Of course, You have to enforce freedon.  The Cuban peopl have good lives, education, and food becuase they are forced to live good lives.
bc5jGZ0uaa	Hollywood didn't take tax payer money.  And those rich americans can earn as much as they want as long as they don't take bail out money.  Seriously, what is so hard about this?  There are already 100 questions on this same subject, do a little reading first.  And, once again it is PRESIDENT OBAMA to you.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	never really thought of it that way - the only thing is hollywood isn't asking for a bailout that i know of anyway.    How about capping some senators, and congress's wages and maybe he can donate some of his own to this mess.  We can start with Pelosi first.|`|i2M7lyPgaa	I generally would agree 100%,, however in this case, since these individuals are bumming money from the tax payers, I can let it slide.  Once its paid back, they should be able to earn what every their companies are willing to pay them.|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	He is capping the wages of the people who took our tax money.... Corporate welfare...... if you want welfare you need to qualify..... in coruporate welfare the maxium an individual can make is 500,000... now if a hard working white American Businessmen's company is not on welfare then he is not capped for Uncle Sam....If the Media elites and hollywood needed welfare too then they would be capped.....|`|VV7zNqQbaa	"It's only white American businessmen that he wants to cap the wages of."    Apparently you believe that every single top-5 executive in every single American business is a white male.      Moreover, if you read the proposal, it says that those five people MAY be paid MORE if the Board of the business approves it by a resolution.  So if business owners really want executives to have higher pay, they can authorize it.    You're incredibly stupid, you know that?|`|VR7JfxM4aa	Think of it as a welfare-to-work program.|`|9npIzlHKaa	Becasue they aren't being laid off.  They are performing the lay offs.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	He is capping the wages of over paid business men who, yes, happen to be mostly white.   Socialism is what the best countries in the world do.|`|73kknl3Qaa	are you kidding me? this is a joke of a question. go away|`|AA10546011	He's a socialist and this is one of the steps towards nationalization of the banks.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Are The Hollywood types and media elites, getting a government bail out ?|`|tvNkizDraa	These companies are receiving OUR money for a bailout. As the lenders, it's fair that WE get some concessions from them for the PRIVILEGE of using OUR money. What about Paulson saying that the financial institutions receiving bailouts needed to be allowed to pay dividends as an incentive to borrow the money? I was very angry! That's our money, they do not need 'incentives' to borrow it!|`|FX4WhQtKaa	I;ll bet he's not going to cap the salary of rev. wright....even though he gets funding from the government...|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Last I checked neither Hollywood nor the media has received government bailout funding.    Is it socialism or responsibility to restrict how businesses can use taxpayer money?    Are you really Hudson Limbaugh in disguise?  Or do you really think you speak for the States of America (I don't really get leaving the first word off names, but if it's what you want to do, I can comply)|`|9lDqqQ8Iaa	It only applies to the "hard working white American businessmen" who are benefiting from the government bailout.

5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	cynical?      You bet he is.      Every single one of us should be cynical about the salaries being paid to the CEO's of companies that are being bailed out.      If these companies were spending their money wisely in the first place, they wouldn't need bailing out, now would they?|`|rttm1SLaaa	Wow, you're missing the entire point.  Yeah, people overspend, that's going to happen with politicians.  Your point is to say that since he's doing that, he's being hypocritical when he caps salaries for CEOs.  When you stop there, you're ignoring the most important part - these CEOs all had their companies bailed out by taxpayer dollars.  When you leave that out, sure, it sounds terrible that Obama spends so much.  I'd rather that he didn't.  But it's a political thing, that's not going to change.  What can change is how we handle companies that we give money to.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Obama wasnt asking for money to bail him out either.    Dont you think that is different?|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	That wasn't tax money, but money people GAVE him, so he could become president.    All members of his party? That's hundreds of millions of people. Why shouldn't Republicans have to pay THEIR taxes.    Out of the hundreds of people he's put in government, THREE owed taxes (which they've since paid) -- get a grip; get a clue.    Uh, if he sounds like a dictator to YOU, that's a fact about YOU (that you're completely cle-challenged), not about HIM.
U2qRvH2laa	I think it should be legal, but most pot smokers I've known have been typically less productive and do tend to let things slide. But again I'm not against it being legal.  Not quite sure what your comment is in regards to, other than opinions vary and if it differs from yours doesn't make it wrong or yours anymore right.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Give me a break. He is a world class swimmer. If he smoke dope regularly he wouldn't be. next question|`|EPqnB7Epaa	I don't.

If he was a regular user, he wouldn't even qualify for the Olympics.    I can see it now, down at the pool.  "Wow man, water's like ... wet".    ***    " 'Regular user' or not is irrelevant".    Of course it's relevant.  Being stoned a few times a year is vastly different from being stoned every day, as are many people I know who don't function as well as they would otherwise.|`|zftm6qkKaa	And while we're on the subject about being green and all natural, how about we start with our own bodies?  Because by in large, pot makes people stupid and stupid people even more so.|`|RAyIfLcWaa	We're right about that and everything else|`|hMLmrPbgaa	No, but they do think that 95% of all pot smokers are black...    ...and to them that's just as bad.|`|3uH441n3aa	Only when they're high|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	Not all conservatives think that way, just as I am sure not all liberals think pot enhances performance.|`|4MxCAm6gaa	I personally don't know for sure but I'll lay around and think about it for a couple of days and then maybe get back with you.|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	Why are you addressing this question to conservatives?    Conservatives didn't outlaw marijuana alone, nor are they the only ones that agree with enforcing laws against drugs such as marijuana .|`|sI3kqp7xaa	No...my husband is one of the productive ones.  Why do you think Conservatives think that?    Nice stereotyping though.

Yes, that includes my own.    It's my personal opinion it will not work. Borrowing money to get us out of a borrowing based problem doesn't seem logical. Nor does raising corporate taxes when business already can't afford to pay employees. Nor does taking US tax dollars, that's money out of OUR pockets, to "redistribute" in pork projects, like sodding the DC mall lawn, stimulate the economy. Simply put, the government doesn't have ability to stimulate the economy. Only we, the consumers, do.|`|wig4qCeJaa	To a certain degree, it will work. Bush's plan was too small to even have a chance.|`|mBt5VgtHaa	Tax cuts will not work in this environment because the private sector is too timid and hoarding cash. Also, the remaining tools to fight the recession have been used. The FED has cut the rates to zero. Government spending will fill in until private sector spending returns. If we wait too long, it will never return.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	I love this quote, but it's so true,  "The stimulus bill" is a rotting corpse and the longer it's left in the sun, the worse it will smell".|`|AA11424005	He is using your tax dollars to pay off his election supporters.  There is no stimulus in his so-called plan.|`|CBx6qHztaa	Hey Mike J...you won't get any money either.

This plan may not be the best but, nobody else is offering any alternate reasonable ideas.    All the republicans say is cut taxes. Which is the same that they have been saying for 30 years.  Why not spend money to create jobs for a change.
AA10709853	you are required to pass a BASIC swim test in boot camp.. very basic.  jump off a platform, tread water for 5 minutes and swim one length of the pool, any stroke.      certain jobs will require much stronger skills.. so Aircrew is probably right out of you cannot swim.      after that.. truly, you will have little need for the skill..because if it should come to pass that your ship is so damaged that you must abandon ship, swimming is the least of worries.....|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	You can still join  my hubby joined and actually failed the swimming test, but wasnt paying attention to which line was the failed line and so he just went and stood in a line, well it was the passed line.

The murder of the innocent is never justified, even if they are liberals.  And just because they had liberal parents does not necessarily mean they'll end up liberals themselves, so calling them liberals in the womb is a bit pre-mature (and an unjustified insult).  But if they do become liberals they have the right to be idiots just like anyone else.  That's America.

I do know one thing though. The government is holding me hostage, blackmailing me so that I can't work, can't vote, can't draw unemployment, nor enroll in any type of school until I finish my VA medical claims due to an ordeal in Iraq involving some sensitive information-- I never signed a waiver for any type of clearance, and neither was I forced to. Instead, I was charged for things that never happened, to cover it all up--- and instead of a court marshal, it was downgraded to Non judicial punishment to censor the news from the media and general public.    I've tried to get a job-- but I've been fired twice for it. The second time it happened, I got a letter that advised me I'd lose my disability compensation check each month if I did it again.    I have done it again-- because I can't live without money. So, I just keep pushing. It just so happens that the government is supporting illegals all the while-- which pees me off even more. All these retired people-- that have done nothing but respect this country and give give give to the community is left with nothing-- but illegals did you say? Oh, they take priority!    Well, that ain't gonna fly. I already have beef with the U.S. government, and will continue till they are arrested and tried. So, this immigration stuff gives me a chance to shove the Mexican flag up their ***!!!    -------    Just keep pushing-- and yell in court if you have to. Make them understand! And if they don't, create something-- and get a petition that's signed by your supporters. I'd support you in a heartbeat!    I wish you luck-- and my best advice to you is to never give up; when you feel you can do no more-- you can do the most!    --Rob :)

I have wanted to catch them too... but usually just curse them out.. if u can please do|`|Ztkz5uG2aa	Forward a complete copy of their scam message including the full headers to the appropriate abuse department:  i.e. abuse@yahoo.com; abuse@hotmail.com, etc.  Don't get involved with them in any way.  Doing so can be personally dangerous for you. That's the same advice the companies will give you.  I've reported dozens of the "scammers" and all that can be done is for the appropriate service to invalidate their email address which is only a minor inconvenience for them since they have to start a new phony email address.  But at least they know they are being watched.  I received one the other day that said I had just won a 2.5 million dollar Yahoo lottery - the sender was a hotmail address and he had a myway.com reply address in the text.  These scammers are so dumb but some people still fall for them.  Like they say "Even a blind pig finds an acorn now and then."  Also, I recommend you get your computer checked for any malware that could have been inserted into your computer when you opened their messages.  That's now the coming thing - if they can't con you then at least they can try to leave "key counters" on your computer so they can steal any personal data you have on your computer - i.e. pin numbers, bank account data, credit card data, etc.
w0EshhFdaa	Esatto!  L'arroganza e la malavita in genere dilagano perch in Italia non c' pi certezza di pena e chi non ha nulla da perdere non si fa troppi scrupoli perch non rischia neanche la libert (visto che la galera ormai non la fa pi nessuno!).  L'inasprimento della pena sarebbe (anzi ) l'unico deterrente contro tutto lo schifo che ci sta attorno!  Ovviamente questo vale per i malviventi (italiani e non).  Ma non nego che mi incaz*o doppiamnete quando vedo e sento di marocchini,tunisini ecc. di religione musulmana che commettono reati UBRIACHI MARCI quando si sa che la loro "fede"  contro l'uso di alcool!!!!  O quando non posso camminare per la strada che questi mi importunano (magari sempre ubriachi) e devo avere paura di essere padrona a casa mia!!  Questo non lo ammetto perch nei loro paesi non possono farlo!!!Se rischiassero le stesse pene starebbero pi attenti a rispettare le regole!!

0a626459b83f90b906870aa255d39c4caa	The Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division was an element of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) formed during World War II. The Women's Division was originally called the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force, which formed in 1941. Women's Division personnel were commonly known as WDs.    WDs supported the war effort by taking over more mundane wartime responsibilities from men, who were made available for combat duties and to instruct in British Commonwealth Air Training Plan schools across Canada. The original 1941 order-in-council authorized "the formation of a component of the Royal Canadian Air Force to be known as the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force, it's function being to release to heavier duties those members of the RCAF employed in administrative, clerical and other comparable types of service employment.". Duties, however, expanded as the war progressed. Among the many jobs performed by WDs, they served as parachute riggers, clerks, photographers, and wireless operators. Approximately 17,000 women served with the Women's Division before it was discontinued in December 1946. The WD motto was We Serve That Men May Fly.|`|5bf97bac7b26dd960b93eade0e3325a4aa	Last I heard, they had two cruisers, a batallion sized ground-element, and a bomber.

It's interesting that Canada doesn't acknowledge my US citizenship after being naturalized 20+ years ago. Canada is like the US 50 years ago, but that depends where you go and what you want.

If you merely replace rupee with a dollar, it will spur an enormous inflation in a matter of weeks and the results will be devastating.    No, equalizing Rupee with a dollar or printing more Rupees will not eliminate poverty, but only create bigger chaos. If you do that, the demand curve will shift immediately and it will create unbelievable inflation. The result will be an immediate devaluation of Rupee and the market will crash. If the solution for poverty was as easy as printing more money or equalizing the currency with a dollar by single policy, then every government would have done exactly that long time ago.|`|uBaKOoU6aa	India's "infrastructure and its poor-ness" is an issue raised by rich people, its not an issue raised by ordinary citizens.

However Bare in mind that a political party will have policies on a Local Government Level and the National Level.

1bb8d470f82f8d3bf45bc0813b126c7faa	you've been granted asylum =) congratulations... you are under the protection for the U.S. government. if you wish you can apply and for 6 months you will receive certain benefits like health insurance, job replacement and until then you can receive food stamps.   immigration is behind processing the applications due to an extra 3 million applications that were filed in 2008 alone, but they are trying to keep up by hiring more staff so just be patient and wait in the mail. within 30 days or more realistically 2 weeks you will receive the notice for taking biometrics. Although you don't really need that card, because if you have received your final grant that comes with an I-94 arrival/departure card, it should have a stamp on it that states work authorization permitted. Even if for some reason that stamp is missing the stamp that states Asylum status granted indefinitely is enough for any employer.   you can apply exactly one year from the date of your granted asylum to become a permanent resident. although it might take a while to get the actual green card, once you do, it will be dated on the date that they have received the application so no worries about that. once you do get the card you no longer will be an asylee but a permanent resident. green cards come in 2 types, temporary ones that are 2 years valid and on your case you will get the permanent one which is valid for 10 years. which only means in 10 years you just have to apply and get a new one, BUT, 5 years from the issue date of your green card you will be eligible to become a U.S. citizen. Long story short, in 6 years you will be a citizen.   people try to go around it and make it shorter some times, because people who are granted refugee status can apply for citizenship 5 year from the date their refugee was granted. this does not apply for people who are granted asylum, however i personally know of someone who took it to the court and was able to get her citizenship approved 5 years from the date of the grant of her asylum.  whatever country you are from, i advise you against using your national passport, only when you get the green card it is ok to use that. until then you have a better option, you can apply for a U.S. refugee travel document which in your case it will be valid for 1 year and every year you have to renew it, which is basically just ripping you off every year. it is not a U.S. passport but worldly recognized and in many places treated like a U.S. passport as well for example Germany doesn't require visa for the holders of that passport.   good luck my friend =)

6b94dfce3b6a1a024d75f1761eee2644aa	Italiano nao pode falar de brasileiro, nao!Eu tb morei no sul da Italia perto de Roma. Sei bem o que vc ta passando e aprendi a lidar com eles quando comecei a conhecer os podres que eles fazem.   Pra comecar: Eles sao famosos por serem traficantes de mulheres. Especialmente por iludir e traficar mulheres do leste europeu. Ora, pergunte para eles como funciona o esquema de 'sequestro' e vc ira entender. Primeiro eles vao de carro para a Romenia (por exemplo) oferecem emprego para as mulheres com idade em 18 - 26 anos. Transportam elas ate a Italia e roubam o passaporte delas. Dao drogas e para inicia-las na prostituicao eles muitas vezes as meninas tem que se submeter a 10-15 homens em UMA noite!!!! Sao violentadas e estupradas e nao recebm nenhum tostao!. So recebem comida e agua ( malmente). Muitas vezes esses criminosos sabem os enderecos das familias delas e ameacam constantemente. As ameacas variam: Tipo ' Se vc tentar fugir, sua familia pode sofrer uma cidente terrivel'. Afim de confundir a policias, eles viiciam as meninas em drogas forte. Geralmente injetaveis. Assim, se elas denunciarem, eles podem alegar que elas estao sob efeito de drogas etc... Passando essa fase que elas se revoltam e ficam com o coracao endurecido. Ai eles passam a colocar as meninas nas ruas( especialmente nas auto-estradas para se prostituirem. Esse ciclo que eles fazem e deprimente. Quando elas conseguem ajuda, ja estao comprometidas demais ( aids ou hepatite) sem falar na dependencia total das drogas.Outra coisa sobre os italianos: Eles adoram prostitutas, por isso nao tem moral nenhuma para falar de ninguem. Se vc tiver a oportnidade de ir a Tailandia, vai entender o que eu to falando. E o paraiso dos italianos. E o pior e que la os travestis sao ' mulheres perfeitas' se vc nao tiver olho clinico especializado no assunto, chega ate a confundir. Os italianos sao os principais clientes delas.  Outra coisa sobre os italianos: No sul sao pobres e criminosos. Se vc for a Napoles, cuidado com a bolsa. Eu quase fui assaltada ( nao por imigrantes e sim por italiano mesmo!!!!)  Sao mal-vistos pelos outros europeus por viverem cacando as mulheres alemas, holandesas, belgas, etc...por dinheiro pois, eles acham que os europeus no norte da europa sao mais ricos. Na Suica , em Zurich e cheio deles que vao para la traballhar limpando aviao, ou em construcao, entre outras profissao que os suicos nao querem fazer.  Enfim, quando algum italiano vem falar de brasileiro pra mim, tem que ta pronto para ouvir sobre os podres dos contarraneos deles tb. Comigo , nao violao!!!!|`|f5beb2ca07dcc72c723a1d48b19f6addaa	Meu caro, o brasileiro, na sua maioria, infelizmente,  igualzinho o papel, ACEITA TUDO, submissamente.|`|6ae7934814a7914fedcd548c4fa4ecefaa	stella,infelizmente,os italianos.s S?o apenas,uns dos demais estrangeiros.ate,na sia.onde me encontro,que falam mal de brasileiras,e brasileiras,e eles S?o tal canalhas.e bandidos.como S?o no brasil.Agora.essa onda de ter "sexo turismo" no brasil,deveria acabar-se se as autoridades brasileiras fossem "competentes" eu lembro,me que quando casei-me em 83,com um asitico.tiver quer "casar'se primeiro,e minha m?e e irm?s,tiveram que assinar o passaporte para mim.,antes de deixar o brasil,.se n?o n?o deixariam eu sair,lembro me,que em S?o paulo.em algumas partes de S?o paulo,.mulheres,e meninas,n?o tinha muita liberdade,em perambular pelas ruas.,a noite naquela tempo.Entao,.cade as leis rgidas,que outrora havia,ai no brasil?cad nossas  autoridades "competentes"e se essa fmeas,S?o obrigadas a se prostituir,,porque  culpar-las? a n?o ser,se for grtis? se essas meninas or mulheres fazem isto,e porque precisam! culpe os sistema.n?o os subjugados.por tal sistemas.

96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	Iran could build Nuclear power plants with very little problem, the problem they have is the plants they are trying to build use ultra rich uranium (inefficient for power production but necessary for nuclear weapons) so their motives are suspect.

848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	Absolutely. Many would argue that Iraq DID lose the war with Iran even with the US backing of Iraq.    To truthist: Edna is right, Although the US supported the Shah for many years, even killing Iranians in 1953 during Operation Ajax to keep him in power, it was indeed the US who betrayed the Shah in the end. Just as we supported Saddam all those years and then poof.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Didnt they even get some "WMD" from us?

The US was in about the same spot on the list of Iraq's military suppliers as that noted arms-dealing country, Denmark.  That includes funding from loans that the US facilitated through the IMF too, that actual direct sales of US materiel to Iraq was almost nothing.  None of the chemical weapons Iraq used against either Iran or the Kurds had anything at all supplied by the US.  Those weapons were made from Russian obtained hardware with engineering support from Germany.  Some hardware was also purchased from Italy and Spain.  The sources of the chemicals were from Russia, France, Singapore, Brazil, Britain, and a few other countries.  There is exactly one purchase from the US, for a few barrels of an industrial solvent that is also widely used as a fire-fighting agent in oil fields that could possibly have been used in the manufacture of mustard gas, but that connection was never made.    Anyone who makes the claim that the US played any role at all in the development of the weapons used in either instance is misinformed at best, a complete idiot at worst.    The only real support during the Iran war that the US gave Iraq was some satellite photo intelligence that helped the Iraqis keep tabs on Iranian troop movements.  What significance that played in the overall scheme of things is probably minimal, since the Iraqi army was bigger and much better equipped than the Iranians.
5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	If the members of the mainstream media disclosed their affiliations and RECUSED themselves in the SAME way that they themselves DEMAND that government officials do, there would be NOBODY left to cover the news.    Gwen Ifell saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with moderating that debate even though she has a great deal to gain financially if Obama wins.  She even got pissed off that people found something objectionable about it - and other media supported that.    Tom Brokaw's wife is chairman of a major environmental lobby yet he has done supposedly "objective" specials on the environment without any disclaimers or disclosures.    It is never mentioned that many of the anchors used to work as STAFF for former Democratic White Houses or Members of Congress. Or they are married to them. Or that their SOs work for the DNC or Democratic campaigns or operatives.  Their SOs are their sources and they get their information from the parties they go to and the friends they hang out with.

My opinion for the best is which ever one you want to serve in.|`|hqbd94Otaa	I agree with the others. If you are hard core about fighting and not wanting much in return go Marines. If your up for the fight, but want to go to college, go Army. Air Force is more relaxed but unless you want to fly, you would have to do your research. The AF always has better accomodations than the Army and isn't so rough. If you want to be stuck on a boat for months at a time, go Navy. I dont' know much about the Coast Guard so I won't comment about it.    I say the Army is the best b/c I am bias towards the Army. But a Navy guy will tell you the Navy is the best and so on.|`|B3uch2eNaa	If you look at everything between bonuses and quality of living it is without a doubt the Army. The marines ask for to much and give you nothing in return. If you dont fly a plane there is no need to be in the airforce and unless you want to be stuck on a boat or submarine with all guys then the navy isnt for you either.|`|LVPNuEsLaa	You need to EXPLAIN your question.  The best for what?|`|Ojk7tMdxaa	All branches have there pluses and minuses.    I enjoyed my time in the Air Force, I got to go to a lot of cool places.  I also received top notch training in electronics and aircraft maintance.  I stayed in pretty nice accommodations compared the the Army and USMC.  I did however work rotating shifts, weekend, holidays, but my time was pretty much my own after duty hours.    I will tell you that the USMC and Army is the best fighting forces in the world, if that is you kind of thing.  That is not my cup of tea but I am sure appreciative if all the soldiers and Marines that do that kind of work.    I do not know much about the Navy, besides they see alot of the world at port calls, but the idea of being stuck on a ship, and not seeing land, was a killer for me.    The Coast Guard has some neat jobs but funding and training can be an issue sometimes compared to the other 4.    Hope this gives you some guidance.|`|cvU3MOqMaa	That all depends on what you are looking for. I am biased towards the Marine Corps because that was the choice that I had made. They have a reputation for being the toughest and the most cohesive. Air Force is good if you want to work with air planes and they are known for being a little more relaxed. If you want to travel a lot and experience life on the open water, then the Navy is for you. The Army is the largest branch and they get all the newest "toys".  Talk to recruiters and do a lot of homework and make the choice that best suits your needs and desires.|`|Ty1GklOEaa	Navy is great if you like tech, traveling around the world, stay away from combat but still help out a lot.    Marines no enlistment bonus no bs your there cause you wanna be there, first to fight, every marine is a rifleman, has the toughest bootcamp and a strong brotherhood. semper fi    Air Force awesome tech, housing, girls but unless if your going in as a pilot not many exciting mos. sf watches planes. para seems real cool    Coast Guard your saving lives and keeping drugs out of America. In my eyes most helpful to America    Army well I know a lot of people are going to hate me for this but it seems like half of them are dumbasses. Just joined to escape their problems, shoot a gun, get an enlistment bonus and then complain when they get deployed. But the other half is outstanding they joined because the army has mos other branches dont have, bases all over, and with the right mos superb training Rangers, SF, medical field    When it comes down to it its up to you what branch is best for you whether you enjoy kicking down doors or sailing the seas. Were all here for the same reason to serve our mighty fine country

I kept the generic avatar because it was harder for a stalker to spot.  I liked being anonymous.    I figured if a person liked my answer then they'd pick me.

Rather, they keep these missiles to keep Iran in check. Clearly Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has an interest in annihilating Israel, army bases and civilian areas together. Israel is worried because they know Iran knows that their nuclear weaponry is a false threat. Besides, the Iranian government gives their weapons to terrorist organisations so they can see to harming Israel without being directly liable.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	Iran has repeatedly threatened to wipe Israel off the map.  Until recently, Iran had no way of doing this.  Israel is afraid that Iran would launch a first strike if they ever acquired nuclear weapons.

Iran wouldn't use the nukes if they got them.  They want them simply for the prestige.  The real worry is that the Iranians will not take good care of the nukes, allowing them to fall into the wrong hands.|`|AA11511852	One thing you seem to forget is that Iran wants to completely destroy all of the Jews and that they have been caught time and again giving weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas.  If Iran gets them do you really think that they would not sell or even give them to those two terrorist groups?  Secondly the two terrorist groups continue to shoot rockets into Israel and do not think that it is wrong to do so.  Next Israel has not said nor do they wish to destroy anyone but wish to live in peace which is something that none of the three want for Israel.|`|sO9SpUo4aa	MAD only works on sane people with sane behavior. Iran would not hesitate to use the bomb on Israel, even if it meant their own destruction. Similarly a terrorist, or suicide bomber can not be detoured from going into a police station because the police have guns.  Terrorist states are not rational, besides one nuke could destroy Israel but it would take the destruction of the world to destroy radical Islam since it is not located in one area.

Du hast jedoch die M?glichkeit, vorzeitig aus dem Mietvertrag entlassen zu werden, wenn du einen Nachmieter stellst, der,  in diesem Fall, deine Wohnung ab sofort bernimmt, vorausgesetzt  dein Vermieter ist mit dem neuen Mieter einverstanden. Lehnt er ihn aus relevanten Grnden ( kann er die Miete dauerhaft und pnktlichzahlen!..) ab, pr?sentierst du ihm zwei weitere Mietinteressenten.  Sind alle Mietbewerber solvent, so  muss er sich fr einen entscheiden und du kannst vorzeitig aus dem Mietvertrag entlassen werden. Dann g?be es noch eine weitere Variante,  hast du eine Kaution/Mietsicherheit hinterlegt, so kann sie mit  der Miete verrechnet werden. Die Mietsicherheit dient u.a.dazu, das sich der Vermieter, beim Ausbleiben der laufenden Mietzahlungen, aus der Mietsicherheit bedienen kann. Insofern  solltest du mit deinem Vermieter ganz offen ber deine Problematik sprechen und gemeinsam eine L?sung finden.  Wnsche dir viel Erfolg. Gr?e

Russia has done a mass genocide of the population of Grozny and the whole country.  The Russians or should I say U.S.S.R have even invented the 75 caliber machine gun only in use in Chechniya.  The Russian people do not support the Russian occupation of Chechiniya by about 80% because they know that now dictator Putin (former head of the communist KGB), in order to get elected blew up buildings and killed many Russians and blamed it on the Chechiyans so that they would support his war.  The Russian people realize they have no business being there, will Russia allow Chechniya independance?  Only if Putin is dead.|`|afvpQHOAaa	There is no such place as the Islamic Caucasian republics to start with.

b6f0b4f3951291e57c3a094abaae9984aa	China is ahead of India--and as a historian/sociologist I see two main reasons.    The first is cultural.  Notwithstanding the period of the "Cultural Revolution" Chinese culture is highly compatible with entrepreneurship and commerce.  The Chinese commercial sector--and culture--was well developed even before Western contact became a factor.  The current growth in China thus has a deep resevoir of cultural values--including the Chinese version of the European "work ethic" to draw on.  India's culture, on the other hand, was oriented much more toward an analogue of western feudalism--a sociatal mindset that is not as conducive to capitalism.    2) Although China is nominally "communist" and definately not a free country in the modern sense, the political leaders have given relatively free rein to the business sector.  In dia, however, a well-entrenched socialist bureaucracy continues to have a negative influenceon growth in some economic sectors.    However--India has some real advantages-if it can take advantage of them.  One is that India is much closer to being a full-fledged democracy than China.  And if China does not "clean up their act" on that score--it will hurt them in the long run.  No country can be effective with a mix of dictatorship and a free economy.  If you look at history,  you will see tha tsooner or later one will destroy the other.  Further, Indian socialism has strong interests in some industries.  If they can get the bureaucracy out of the way, it can become an asset--a body of public servants who have a much better knowledge of market economics than the regime in China does.    The cheif mistake both cuntries are making from a technical standpoint is not moving directly to alternative (non-fossil fuel) energy production.  Quite aside from environmental concerns, these technologies are rapidly being made obsolete.  Once the cheap way to produce energy, they are on the verge of becoming relative expensive compared to the new technologies beginning to come on line.  Continuing down that roadd will place them at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the industrial world.|`|hCdCxaVcaa	It's pretty much a race between India and China. China is at an advantage in that they do not have a caste system and they have a far greater resource of dollar reserves. India is at an advantage in that they have the English language and better communications.     Both countries have some of the same very serious problems:  - huge gap between rich and poor  - hopeless social welfare and health situations  - lack of infrastructure, especially in rural areas  - property rights all over the shop  - endemic and terrible corruption  - aggressive foreign policy interests  - spread of AIDS    Personally I think India may have more of an advantage than people often predict, but that's just my opinion... I've invested in both economies :)|`|IDkINhBHaa	Because China's cap on FDI (foreign direct investment) is 10 times India's ($65BN versus $6.5BN).|`|AeVrn2CHaa	Short answer now, but interesting ?, so will check for stats.  We went to China first under Nixon, and China infrastructure/roads made it more suitable for consumer goods. Start of info age and noteable internet made commerce with India possible in service industries where infrastructure/roads not as important. Recently, India man rec'd Peace Prize for micro loan projects, and since India largest Democracy, expect in many creative, entrepreneurial ways, India will overtake China. They will invest in infrastructure and social advancement. Expect more medical progress from them, as well as organic farming and energy innovation. Very educated group of people in India, and I believe that they still value teaching of Ghandi.  My opinion and not based on stats is that inner turmoil can only bubble if China continues same path.

b830fa5e6f4964c73000ae9d526c3881aa	Ol Luciana!  Fiz intercambio na Alemanha em 1999, e vou contar pra voc, no geral, sobre essa minha experincia. Durante o tempo que morei l, um ano, viajei muito, passeei bastante, conheci muitas pessoas e lugares diferentes. Adorei a experincia!  para mim, um lugar mgico e as pessoas, s?o reservadas, mas s?o muito receptivas. Passei um ano l estudando, na cidade de Col?nia. Gostava muito da seguran?a que tem l. Uma vez fui a uma boite, e quando eram, mais ou menos, duas horas eu fiquei afim de ir pra casa. Meus amigos queriam ficar mais um pouco, ent?o decidi ir sozinha. E, fui! Em plena madrugada eu andando pelas ruas da cidade pra pegar o trem e ir pra casa, bem tranqila.  Outra coisa maravilhosa que me encantou, foram as 4 esta??es do ano bem definidas. Um dia vc vai dormir com a cidade repleta de flores, e acorda com uma surpresa. vc olha pela janela, e cad o colorido das flores? Est tudo branquinho com a neve cando l fora.  E tem mais! Tive a oportunidade fantstica de ver o "sol da meia noite". Tem um perodo q o sol come?a a se p?r somente s 10:30, 11 horas da noite, ent?o em plena meia noite vc ainda pode ver pequenos raios de sol.  s vezes gostava de sair s pra ficar andando pela cidade. Sem motivo nenhum! Adorava andar pelas ruas, tanto no centro da cidade como nos vales, onde a neve era ainda mais bonita e, de vez em quando, encontrava um esquilinho.   E a comida? Huumm! Sehr Lecker! como dizem em alem?o! deliciosa!  :-) Na escola foram muito receptivos, mas a dificuldade na comnpreens?o era grande. Fazia somente provas de ingls.  Minha famlia era bastante acolhedora e tinham grande interesse em me falar sobre seus costumes. Desde que voltei ao Brasil, n?o tive ainda a oportunidade de voltar para visit-la e matar a saudade, mas ainda hoje nos correspondemos e espero voltar no prximo ano.  Olha, acredito mesmo que valeria a pena vocs morarem na Alemanha. Os alem?es valorizam muito a cultura e conhecimentos no geral. Os colgios s?o bons e os professores s?o bem atenciosos, sempre incentivando para que o aluno expresse seus conhecimentos dentro da sala de aula.  Espero que d tudo certo pra vocs.

ec1919e887dd77e46f86ed5fe92702a6aa	Berisha mi hanno appena detto che tu sei 1 clone della Camilla Viola!! E' vero questo fatto???    Per chi non ha ancora capito bene cosa sta succedendo intorno a noi e che genere di mafia ci circonda,  NON MI STANCHERO MAI  DI  RIPETERLO:     Qui non si tratta solo dellcriminale ordinario da 2 soldi ma di ORGANIZAZZIONI  MAFIOSE TRANSNAZIONALI  A LIVELLO MONDIALE!!!   Questi 3 elementi con questo colpo erano in una specie di banco di prova, il superamento e/o non del quale determinava la loro entrata e/o non dentro 1 grupetto mafioso ancora pi grande!!   Faccio richiamo allordine della ragione a certi utenti che superficialmente pensano di aver risolto il problema della criminalita in italia con il semplice gesto di limitare limmigrazione e di buttare gli immigrati fuori dallitalia : Signore e signori vi state sbagliando alla grande!   1-Vi siete mai chiesti come  possibile che sul territorio italiano dove esiste gi una mafia autoctona (con forti radici e ben inserita dentro laministrazione e lo stato italiano a tutti i livelli) ne entrano altre straniere (?) senza trovare resistenza! La verita  che le cosi dette mafie straniere sono solo delle appendici e fanno parte della stessa mafia italiana (Cosa Nostra, 'Ndrangheta, Camorra etc)  le quali hanno dato in appalto da gestire agli delinquenti stranieri il lavoro + sporco: droga, prostituzione, traffici di ogni genere, !!! Chiunque che conosce anche 1 po la potenza e il potere nascosto della mafia italiana si rende conto benissimo quanto  stupido e ridicolo insinuare che litalia  invasa dalle mafie straniere!!!    2- Allo stato italiano non interessa dare di dosso a questa gente x il semplice motivo poiche loro creano soldi che vengono riciclati  entrando nel giro degli investimenti puliti davanti alla legge!!! In poche parole allo stato, la mafia , gli fa aumentare il PIL annuale e rigonfiare le casse !!!      Nello specifico la mafia albanese  una mafia transnazionale tanto che negli  Usa  domina il narcotraffico  di cocaina ed eroina ,  hanno creato con i colombiani, con la sacra corona unita in puglia, con la mafia russa e con le cosche turche 1 rete cosi fitta di affari  di miliardi e miliardi di dollari che riempiono le tasche di politici a livello internazionale, finiscono nella alta finanza e perfino in Borsa (gestendo azioni e aziende  multinazionali) ..dio santo quanto mi fa rabbia la vostra ignoranza!!!

Ma in questa mia risposta colgo l'occasione per ribadire una cosa che spesso viene ignorato perch ormai siamo abituati a crescere ed essere allevati come polli. Il termine  sta rasentano quello degli animali tra prede e predatori. Il fenomeno si accentuer sempre di pi sulla spinta dell' aumento demografico che vedr sparire i nostri gi precari confini della nostra privacy. Eppure le leggi ci sono, anzi in Italia abbondano per una maniacale attivit parlamentare che sforna leggi e decreti come la moltiplicazione dei pesci.   Allora visto che siamo in un contesto provocatorio io proporrei un numero di abitanti, per km quadrato fisso, cio un incremento demografico dovrebbe essere corretto con la soppressione degli eccedenti. Oppure, un' altra soluzione sarebbe quella di confinare tutti gli indesiderati, che trasgrediscono le leggi, in un sito geografico dove tutti i malavitosi e pervertiti possono fare tutto quello che vogliono senza tutele di legalit.

f36994cace4ab50dadffe8d684b956acaa	Pearl Harbor foi sempre retratado como um ataque surpresa de uma na??o insuspeita. E isso era em grande medida verdade. A aten??o do povo americano estava centrada na guerra na Europa, receoso de ser arrastado para ela. Nessa altura j Roosevelt apoiava a Gr?-Bretanha contra Hitler fornecendo ao Reino Unido armas sob o acordo (Lend-Lease Act) de Mar?o de 1941. Os carregamentos americanos por barco estavam em perigo devido aos ataques dos submarinos alem?es. Poucos americanos estavam preocupados com a guerra Sino-Japonesa que j lavrava desde 1937.    Agora se a administra??o Americana ficou surpreendida pelo ataque a Pearl Harbor, isso j  um assunto completamente diferente. Existem fortes indcios de que o governo americano sabia dos planos japoneses, ou deveria saber. Existiam claras indica??es nesse sentido.    A 27 de Janeiro de 1941, o enviado peruano em Tquio disse ao terceiro secretrio na embaixada dos Estados Unidos que ele tivera conhecimento atravs de fontes dos servi?os secretos que os japoneses tinham um plano de guerra que inclua um ataque a Pearl Harbor. A 10 de Julho, o adido militar americano em Tquio reportou que a marinha japonesa estava a praticar ataques areos com torpedos em alvos estacionados na baa de Ariake  uma baa que fazia lembrar Pearl Harbor. O adido militar americano no Mxico reportou igualmente que os japoneses estavam a construir submarinos minsculos que seriam levados para o Havai para um ataque a Pearl Harbor.        .........|`|72a13bb42cbcb77e32947d6e846f8711aa	De novo essa pergunta.|`|807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	porque os americanos soltaram uma bomba sobre hiroshima e nagazaki|`|2axs0FVmaa	Brsil-3... respondeu muito bem a quest?o.  Tm mais, o ataque n?o foi trai?oeiro como divulga a histria contada pelos americanos.   Primeiro, o Jap?o atacou uma base militar, onde n?o havia civis, n?o tinha hospitais, creches e nem escolas.   Segundo, a base de Pearl Harbor praticamente vazia (porque os americanos sabiam que ocorreria o ataque), de forma que a baixa de soldados foi muito pequena, tendo basicamente destrui??o material.

Ent?o o jap?o passa ater duas sadas ou deixava tudo que j havia conquistado na china e ficava desmoralizado perante o mundo ou atacava a indochina, ilhas do pacifico, birmania, cingapura e apertava cada vez mais a china e atacava seu principal inimigo, a esquadra do pacfico que ficava fundeada na base naval de pearl harbor, no hava.

Isso deu ao jap?o o dominio do mar por seis meses, mas n?o deu para enfraquecer os EUA de maneira que permitisse a desistencia de uma guerra.|`|x4n0Gu5taa	Pelas respostas que li tem muita gente  que v os filmes ao contrrio! At p?em Hiroshima e Nagasaki antes! Desculpem o desabafo: e ainda falam que portugus  que  burro! Ou tem muito portugus respondendo antes de mim ou s?o todos descendentes!   Quando os Japoneses come?aram a amea?ar o Sudoeste Asitico, Roosevelt congelou todos os fundos japoneses em bancos americanos, resultando num corte nos seus abastecimentos de petrleo. Isto foi considerado um acto de guerra pelo Jap?o, e a retalia??o j era esperada pelos planeadores americanos. Enquanto a frota japonesa se aproximava de Pearl Harbor, os servi?os secretos ingleses e americanos j sabiam dessa aproxima??o. O primeiro ministro Winston Churchill notificou o seu comandante no Pacfico que os japoneses se dirigiam para Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt, por outro lado, n?o notificou os seus comandantes, enviou os seus navios mais estratgicos (os porta- avi?es) para o alto mar onde estariam a salvo e avisou os postos de observa??o da ilha de Kauai que se mantivessem inactivos.    Parece que Roosevelt intencionalmente preparou o palco para um ataque surpresa- chocando a na??o e instantaneamente mudando a opini?o pblica do n?o-intervencionismo para o fervor da guerra.

u0skPBEZaa	I REALLY hope no one says it was an inside job.    What is the sound that Loose Change makes?  It is disappointingly hollow.    There is not that much confusion surrounding 9/11.  It has been widely understood why it was done and by whom.    Listen, It is logistically impossible to maintain blanket secrecy in a plot as massive as the one this film suggests. Successful conspiracies depend on the commitment of ALL who conspire. Let us consider that if 9/11 was, in fact, a governmental conspiracy, it would require the involvement of literally THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS in planning, execution, and cover-up. All would have to keep quiet about it...FOREVER.     Conspirators would have to come from all levels of government, not only federal, but also state and city levels, including Mayor Giuliani, also the DOD, NORAD, all military branches, the FAA, Wall Street, WTC owners, the security firms overseeing the WTC, the insurance industry, the airline industry, flight schools, Pentagon staff, demolition teams, the FDNY, the scientific community, the relatives of the victims and terrorists, the list goes on.

Lo que pasa es que este tratado se firmo en 1994 y no se tomo en cuenta ni las necesidades de Mxico ni su futuro. Se dio el acuerdo por intereses personales de los que estaban en el poder en aquel entonces.    Es cierto que Mxico necesita un tratado de libre comercio con Estados Unidos, porque es su vecino y un potencial consumidor de productos. Sin embargo Mxico necesita un tratado que lo ayude a crecer, que apoye al campo y las empresas mexicanas, que impulse la generacion de empleos y que establesca una serie de regulaciones comerciales justas.    El actual TLC tiende a dar preferencias a los productos de Estados Unidos y se les dan ventajas de competencia, no se les cobra tanto arancel y no existen restricciones sobre la calidad de los productos.    A Mxico entran productos estadounidenses de muy mala calidad y sin ningun problema y a Estados Unidos no pueden entrar productos mexicanos de buena calidad porque generan competencia en el mercado (un simple ejemplo es el caso del aguacate o el atun).    A todo lo anterior hay que sumarle que a la clase poltica de Mxico lo ltimo que le importa es el desarrollo prospero de Mxico para los mexicanos.    Es una pena que una gran idea, como lo es un tratado de libre comercio, no sea bien aprovechada por los negociadores mexicanos!!!!!!|`|ZyiesnBGaa	A favor te has imaginado cuantos empleos si se hiciera bien estarian en Mxico, slo que no hay buen manejo de esto y no es por el gobierno federal es en todos los estados del pas por razones partidistas no hay un buen empleo del TLC.|`|190iyHc1aa	En contra, por supuesto.|`|ZIHBxbtUaa	a favor, el balance final nos favorece, afortunadamente los gringos no le toman la palabra a la runfla pejista.

9QBlKlFmaa	The tone of the "details" gives away the asker's bias.  Guess what that bias just might be.    This fellow has dragged up another myth!    During the Six Day War in 1967, the USS Liberty was sailing in Israeli territorial waters and was UNMARKED.      It refused to identify itself to the Israelis  They considered that this ship might be a warship belonging to the armed forces of one to the countries at which it was at war.  So, not knowing that this was an American ship, the Israelis attacked it.  Right after the attack, the Liberty identified itself, but by then it was late.  The Israelis offered all possible help in treating the injured, and they even compensated the families of those who were unfortunately killed and wounded.    This was a very sad story in the relations between the two allies, the United States and Israel.    But the attack was in error, the ship was not marked and refused to identify itself, and the Americans understood and accepted the Israeli apology and compensation.    To claim anything else is just to stir up animosity and to falsify the facts.    And that is a plot to cover up the dastardly terror being waged around the world by radical Islamic terror groups, like Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hisb'Allah and El Aqsa Brigades.           .|`|825df5adf6b3a70e8df648249cb811f7aa	why nobody find bin ladin yet ?|`|owQwgGY8aa	You need to be more specific so those who don't subscribe to...

Don't want to alienate the jewish voter here in the US|`|DZjiEH2Paa	Because even a cursory investigation would have led to the public discovering that Israel possessed nuclear weapons. That's the only secret that would cause Israel to attack what it knew to be a US Navy ship.    Our own government assisted in the cover up by surreptitiously repairing Liberty in a foreign port and swearing the crew to silence.    De Shallit, you're full of it. Liberty carried regulation US Navy markings and had her name painted in 6 ft. High letters on the fantail. She was flying the US flag when attacked and broke out the larger holiday ensign once the attack started.    Before the attack, Israeli jets overflew the ship at a low enough altitude that sailors could see the pilots wave back to them.    No one believed that Liberty was anything other than a US Navy vessel. The only logical conclusion is that they overheard something Israel didn't want them reporting on.    The attack only broke off when emergency repairs were made to the ship's antenna and Liberty got a distress call off in clear. There WOULD have been an investigation if the Israelis had continued the attack at that point and the US Navy failed to respond.    The collusion by the US government in the coverup following the attack can only mean that vital Israeli interests were perceived to be at stake.|`|aGPlV135aa	Because mature people recognize that accidents do happen in wartime.|`|zqaFZfxbaa	Well, if we were to declare war on another country, the libs would go for Bush's throat, literally.

9911a7f370fda3dbe5e3fe7c06612c9faa	Brassey's Encyclopedia of Land Forces and Warfareby Franklin D. Margiotta - Technology - 1996 -   These grenades are used mainly for control of civil disturbances. Rifle Grenades   Antipersonnel rifle grenades come in two types,     You are asking about "dual purpose" rife grenades which are  as you noted.    They have been around since say 1915, all of WWII and were rather finsihed by the Korean War.  WWII rifle grenades needed to be shot via a blank in the rifle, later they could use a ball round...    But the grenade launcher changed all that -the "plinger" of Vietnam, which was the same principle.
9HSRRtnXaa	I am against this idea    We have a problem with prison overcrowding as it is.

AA10998168	I think Malcom Turnbull is playing games,  because I think he knows that there will not be a recovery and this is the collapse of capitalism. (Sorry!)  I think Kevin Rudd knows this too and is giving hand-outs now so that people have got something before the whole system disintegrates. Malcolm Turnbull wants to be able to say "I told you so" when this happens, if Kevin Rudd gets his way, but in fact it won't make any difference to the world money system either way because NO money is going to be worth much soon, and Malcolm is just seizing his opportunity to make some political capital out of it if he can.  This whole mess is caused by rampant capitalism. Capitalism is not a bad thing if it is controlled and people are not allowed to indulge in total greed, but the American philosophy being "Grab all you can get, and to hell with the hindmost" has plunged us all into disaster. (Not that the rest of us were slow to catch on to this idea!)  If the $42 billion dollar stimulus package is blocked the money will vanish anyway and we will have nothing to show for it. It's a desperate scenario but I think it's true, Kevin Rudd is just trying to do SOMETHING to save the situation, however futile it may all be in the long run. (We've had so many warnings in recent times with various economies collapsing in Asia, we should have taken note of them, but we all follow the USA like a flock of sheep, instead of thinking for ourselves.)  Maybe the collapse will be a good thing in the end and will cause us to look at better ways to organise our societies so that they are fairer to all and we don't have some people who are obscenely rich and some who can't pay their household bills!  We will need to change our ways of thinking too, so that we don't consider that people who can't pay their bills are just feckless or stupid, when in fact many are not paid enough to live. That's classism and it exists everywhere in the world, including Australia.  One of the things about this disaster that gets to me, is that the enormous amounts of money that have been lost didn't really exist at all, they were just numbers in the ledgers. Fantasies.   Maybe we will gain new and caring and co-operative relationships and all pull together for the common good instead of the "cult" of the self that predominates now. That would be true riches!|`|73c720ce57f97a7805475b7e5715a809aa	I think they're right. Most of the stimulus won't be implemented for years. They're trying to fix the economy and further gov'ment in the same bill, which cannot end well.|`|OeJ1D1cCaa	To be honest,open and direct I think Turnbull is doing is really off the beam.The stimulus is badly needed to push the economy forward by injecting funds into most sectors that generate work,improvement to our schools and all the things that are being proposed in the package.Its typical of the High Rollers of the Liberal Party to object to any benefits that are given to ordinary working Australians.Howard tried to do it ( his only friend is Bush) .Nelson failed ( where is he now,?) and now Turnbull is up.up and away....Tax cuts are proposed by him,they take years top filter through the economy .cash benefits are immediate..Get it Turnbull..??

Candide, I have no problem with funding education. The thing you need to realize is that A. education spending is a State issue as outlined in our Constitution and B. they are putting this things in a stimulus bill that does not address the issues...they are trying to sneak a bunch of other stuff in there and push it through with things that must get done now.

The stimulus plan won't work.  It is alot of debt for pork projects Democrats like.  It won't do a damn thing except make us poorer.

Many values have fallen 4-5 fold = One I know of - House sold for 1.3 million, bank repoed with paper over 1 mil. tried to sell for 480 thou. still no buyers - finally sold for 230 thousand.

L8QR8EJraa	Most state laws say that if you must file federal income taxes then you must file state income taxes.     But if you are not required to pay a federal income tax then you don't have to file state income tax.    Taxing labor is illegal.  All direct taxation must be apportioned according to census.  Income is profits from corporate activity.    I want to see the law as well.|`|3u69epc0aa	How about this, refuse to pay your taxes and the law will come to you.|`|Xn0Lh8T3aa	The first income tax imposed by the federal government was during the War Between the States.    You see, most of the money received by the government came through tariffs that for the most part were paid by the South.    When the South seceded, so did the money.    At the time, the Federal government ignored the Constitution and its provisions for direct taxes necessarily being apportioned.    Imagine that.    At least the government responsible for our current income tax was deft enough to realize an amendment to the Constitution was necessary (16th) to make it legal, although remaining unjust, it did pass the law.    The question regarding the 16th is whether or not it was properly ratified.    Regardless, of whether the law was properly passed, ratified or upheld in the courts, the people retain the final say on it through juries in tax cases.    Innocent should therefore be the rightful and just verdict in all cases regarding the income tax as a free and knowledgeable people should not sanction theft by law.    The government knows it cannot rely on people to voluntarily hand over their money under an unjust law come April 15th of every year. That's the primary reason they require employers to take it from you and forward the plunder before you get it via withholding provisions in the law.    Remember, just because a law exists does not automatically make the law just.|`|697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	Re: Is there a law that states you must pay an income tax?  Yes, there is.  The income tax laws are codified as Title 26 of the U.S. Code.  You can read it at http://uscode.house.gov/download/title_2... or at http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/  The sections that apply to most people are Sections 1, 61, 62, 63, 3402, 6001, 6011, 6012, and 6151 along with several others.    Title 26 is prima facie law or evidence of the actual laws passed by Congress.  To read the actual laws passed by Congress, you have to read the U.S. Statutes at Large.  The U.S. Statutes at Large are where all the federal laws are published.  For the most part, the Statutes at Large are not available online.  You can read them in most law libraries and most Federal Depository Libraries.  You can do a search for Federal Depository Libraries to find one in your state.    Our current tax laws get their basic structure from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Several acts of Congress have amended that law over the years since.  To read the 1986 law, go to the Statutes at Large and look in Volume 100 beginning on page 2085.    Re: Is there a law that states you must file?  Yes, section 6012 requires a tax return for people with taxable income greater than the standard deduction.    Re: 16th amendment was never passed by Congress.  Wrong. The 16th amendment was passed by Congress on July 12, 1909.  It was sent to the states for ratification.  The required number of states ratified the amendment by February 25, 1913. Arguments proclaiming the amendment was never ratified have never won a single court case.    Re: Section 861  Section 861 refers to income from a foreign source.  It has nothing to do with people who earn money from sources within the U.S. and it does not negate the fact that money earned in the U.S. is taxable.  The '861 argument' has been used many times in court and it has never been successful.  Here is a quote from just one court case on the issue.  "Bell's main rationale for avoiding the income tax is known as the 'U.S. Sources argument' or the 'Section 861 argument.' This method has been universally discredited."   United States v. Bell, 414 F.3d 474 (3d Cir. 2005).  You can read it at http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3...    Re: Paperwork Reduction Act  Irrelevant.  Courts have unanimously agreed that the IRS has complied with the PRA. See United States v. Denny R. Patridge, 507 F.3d 1092, 1094-95, 2007 TNT 221-11, Nos. 06-3635 and 06-3785 (7th  Cir. 11/14/2007)    Re: Full Paycheck Law  All the information on the Internet about this 'law' is complete conspiracy theory B.S.  Most of it comes from a total lack of reading comprehension.  For example, one site refers to 31 CFR 215.2 as proof that federal income tax withholding is voluntary.  That is wrong.  What that section of the CFR does say is that in the instance where a civilian federal employee can voluntarily request withholding from their pay for state, county, or city income taxes from their federal pay.  That section is irrelevant in regards to withholding of federal income taxes from a person's paycheck.    I am fairly certain that you are completely delusional, but maybe you will surprise me.  If you follow what you stated in your question, you will only hurt yourself in the long run.|`|AA10389562	The courts and prisons are full of people who have tried to take your stand.

You pay the phone co to not give it out sure, but then you gave it out yourself to people under no such obligation.

xRbL1xJ7aa	I think after the 100% no vote by the Republicans the other day to Obama's stimulus package, in spite of Obama meeting with them, and compromising with them, is a sign of things to come. I don't think the Republicans have any interest in bipartisanship and will be fighting Obama for the next 4 years on everything. They're getting their party ready for the next Congressional vote and have every intention in doing what they think they have to, in order to get their lost seats back.     This only shows they haven't changed, have no interest in changing and will remain the GOP. Although they should rename it the GOWEP. The Grand Old White Elite Party. Sure, they picked a black man to head the party, but all for show, which is pretty much what the Republican party has been for decades. As if that will bring black voters to them.    I don't think the Democrats are playing the Machismo game. I believe 100% that Obama, by including Republicans in his cabinet, even though I don't agree with some of his choices, is truly wanting to change the divide America has faced in 8 years, but the Republicans will continue to play games, be deceiptful, as they were when they voted 100% no on the stimulus plan and are going to try and work Obama as much as they can. Luckily, he has shown he can't be thrown off balance.    When Cheney said yesterday, that closing Gitmo will make us targets for more attacks he is still trying to scare the American people, as he and Bush did for 7 years. Of course he failed to include that Obama is going to do it slowly over a years time and in such a way to use his adviser's to make it safe. Cheney was trying to plant the seed in American's minds that if we are attacked again, that will be the reason why, even though the Bush administration did nothing, or very little to find Bin Laden, which in turn allowed Al Queda to become stronger than they were before and Bush did nothing to make us safer. He only put us in more danger.     Obama will realize this in time, if he hasn't already and it will get to the point, where he'll stop trying to get them involved.     I think the American people, if they don't understand yet, wil and the Republican party will continue to bury themselves until they can no longer be seen. Only time will tell. The Republicans remain spiteful and evil as ever. They will never learn.|`|0ixBWT6Xaa	Yes, my party is better than your party crap.Not saying I agree with everything in it but come on you people, it's called compromise for the betterment of America!|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	Republicans are doing their jobs...the reason they have voted against it is because the people who elected them told them too...|`|SLSX6QQsaa	No, they are just going along with what the people of their party want.  Republicans tend to be financially stable more so than democrats and this is why they are picking apart the handouts aspect of the package.  I totally want my stimulus check and can't wait to get it, although I know its only a temporary fix and is really going to do more harm than good. Theres no way even a $2000 check per single person is going to pull us out of enough debt and financial issues when these people are unemployed and running on empty.  But whatever Mr. Obama wants to do, I could really use a couple k right now.|`|zH0h0Tr0aa	Yes and they do not care how badly the taxpayers are being damaged while they play games.!~!|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Yes, especially the Republicans I think.   However, it makes sense to discuss the proposed expenditures in some detail for cost/benefits/priorities before deciding on a total expenditure and program.   Decisions made under the whip are rarely wise.   I'm disappointed in Obama's urgency (as with our own Oz PM Rudd's).  The sky won't fall down if a decision takes a week or ten days of discussion.   The problem is whether it's a matter of collective wisdom or Party Games.  I suspect it's more the latter.

BLMh0dG6aa	Corruption is there, it isn't created by such regulations.|`|bc1202e9aa15ed85d573b1219c69b9cdaa	Indeed. That's a very valid point. When avoiding regulations can save a significant amount of money, that temptation is there.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	ABSOLUTELY. Get the government out of our lives!|`|gE03TUtQaa	It always lead to more corruption that is why they make them.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I watched the Markopolos hearing, it was fascinating.  He did mention that creating more regulations is not the end all solution, it's a step in the right direction, but members of the SEC can be made to overlook violaters (bribes work great for this purpose), members of the SEC can become bankers and ensure the SEC isn't after them, and some people will find ways to scheme and con people legally even with regulations in place.  It is a never ending game of cat and mouse.    Perhaps Markopolos' best suggestion was to give ordinary citizens the ability to sue companies or individuals that they thought were violating regulations.  If this were the case, Markopolos would not have to pester the SEC for 9 years, he could do it himself, he had all the info he needed.  He also suggested providing incentives to SEC employees for looking into and uncovering regulations violations.  As it stands, their is no incentive for the SEC to investigate a company, but their is incentive for SEC employees to take bribes to NOT investigate a company or individual.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	You are........      wise.    It's called "unintended consequences" by the regulators.|`|EjCaTfq0aa	Short simple answer. No it will not lead to more corruption.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	Not particularly.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	Do more laws lead to more crimes...yes.    [The principle of legality is the legal ideal that requires all law to be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law. It is closely related to legal formalism and the rule of law and can be traced from the writings of Feuerbach, Dicey and Montesquieu.]    [The principle can be varyingly expressed in Latin phrases such as Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali (No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a pre-existing penal law), nulla poena sine lege (no penalty without law) and nullum crimen sine lege (no crime without law).]    Less regulation does not improve ethical behavior, it only make unethical behavior legal.
LxVWTrnBaa	The problem with the American manufacturers is of their own making.    European and Japanese ARE higher quality (no matter how hi-qual the Americans are).    Korean are qual and cheaper than comparible American products.    Chinese (not speaking of cars) are just plane cheap.  _________    The reason why their sales are up in China and Latin America - NO UNION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Same for Europe probably.    The reason for American inferiority:    Overpriced  Union  Conglomerated Companies (TOO LARGE)    The Sollution of American Motor industry.    Reduce tariffs to imports  Demonopolise the Big Three (GM makes chasses/frames, Pontiac - not owned by GM - builds off those frames to make their products they sell, and the same with Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile (Yeah, I'll buy it), Saturn, Holden, GMC, Chevrolet, etc.) - GM, Daimler-Chrysler, Ford sells off  all its companies to other owners.  Get rid of National and Industry-wide Unions reduce them to company wide and job specific - GMC Welders Union of Midwest City, OK (not in business any more but I remember it) instead UAW-GM.    Why this will work?    Tariffs - competition  Demonopolise - competition, and reduce of Job loss - If Pontiac goes out of business only Pontiac employees and buyers are affected instead of Pontiac leading to all of GM going out of business.  The reason American cars are so expensive is because the cost of production (their employees) are far more than they are worth.  The Unions are FAR TOO BIG and really don't represent their constituents very well - They won't budge even though it will cost them all their jobs.    BUYING AMERICAN PRODUCTS IS NOT THE ANSWER ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS MORE EFFICIENT FOR OTHERS TO MAKE IT.  THE REAL AMERICAN PRODUCT IS REALLY ONLY INGENUITY AND ENTERPRISE AND IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT PRODUCTS WE HAVE WE CAN PRODUCE THEM AND SELL THEM.  IF OUR NATION RUNS DRY OF ALL NATURAL RESOURCES WE COULD STILL BE THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE WORLD.|`|4nmLPk44aa	No unions are!!!|`|wz9szz3Gaa	This is not G.M first bail out in the 80's they beg and got it but landed up laying off many people and the unions used the money for there needs and retirees. So I believe they did it to themselves by not restructuring the company and making cars that are efficient I believe they need to claim bankruptcy and start all over.|`|JthubNIsaa	No. The auto makers are. The all knew over 10 years ago they had to retool their factories but chose not to. Fat cats rolling in the truck/SUV dollars. They failed to read the tea leaves and they pay good money to those that are supposed to do just that. Greed is what brought them down. And the labor unions. They should file BK which will force a restructure.|`|de711i5Vaa	no, the Do Nothing unions and the Executives that got rich are to blame. Unions are useless and waste money.|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	I just bought a car in November and had x number of dollars to spend.  When I went to the GM lot, I could not buy a car for x, I had to spend x + $5,000.      If the vehicle that I looked at was worth the money I would have spent it on the car, but after reviewing on-line reviews, consumer reports and talking to people who owned them, I decided to buy a Honda CRV instead.      I bought the car for x - $500 and I am happy with the purchase.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Unions are a big deal - the labor rates are astronomical and in many cases they hold back technology.    For instance, if a machine is built that replaces human labor they install the machine but continue to pay people who's jobs were eliminated - that's just stupid.    The hold on the unions caused a slow emergence into quality that standardizes cars.  Today the quality is very good but they arrived at the quality point way too late.  Japan's quality was brought to them by an american who spent years in Detroit and was rejected so he left for Japan who listened, caught up, and we've been playing catchup ever since.    The other issues were dumb marketing.  They continued to build these massive SUVs and staked the entire industry on it.  Personally I like SUVs and trucks but they clearly saw that at some point the gas would make them almost impossible to sell; yet the went full steam forward knowing the coming doom.    I think that there problems remain with them, not the public.  The public will buy what they will buy, that should influence the markets to produce what they want to buy and 10 mpg vehicles was the wrong choice for this decade.|`|AA11713693	No because you can not help what happens.|`|fPMVuB87aa	well with cars like a hummer...|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	Because, many years ago the Big 3 made a crappy product.

It is no wonder that the Rich drive European made cars, only the upper middle-class drive US made cars and everybody else drives what they can afford (Asian-made new cars or used cars).|`|EOhxXxM9aa	Actually it's the republicans who are most at fault.Back in the late 70's early 80's when autoworkers started asking for limits on imports the republicans cried "protectionism" and "unfair "competition.    Also look where all the foreign assembly plants are located.....in red states.Then look at how the senators from those states were ready to filibuster to keep the government from making the loans to those companies.    The collapse of the big 3 would mean an immediate market gain of millions of units per year for those companies building vehicles being made in their states.|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	Because I prefer a car that gives me less problems.|`|AA10581499	Because they make a crappy product.

The same quality worker costs GM 3 times what the market dictates.    Why not just have honest supply and demand dictate what people are paid, and what auto's should cost? Why support some above all others who you make poorer as a result of the meddling and bring down the whole economy with the stupid situation created just so democrats can buy voting blocks?    No company can work out with such an idiotic government as Michigan keeps electing. Lets do some Darwin here and stop supporting losers! The whole economy will win if we do.    Why am I going to buy from a company who charges me to much so they can pay some lazy chump 3 times more to do 3 times less than the average worker in the US, for a job a chimp could almost take care of?|`|sR9ik5J6aa	Latte Liberals facination with over priced foreign cars.|`|n0pt3w5Laa	Well obviously it would be more enticing if the American cars were better quality.

Worse in value, parts, and stability.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	A combination of several factors are to blame.  I buy American cars, just not new ones.  Can't seem to swallow loosing 10% of the value of a vehicle just because I drive it off the lot.  Some imports certainly hold their value better in our market.

I've said this for years and it's come to pass.  When a country produces **** vehicles they will outsold by competitors who make quality vehicles.    I've owned Toyotas since 1984 and will continue to buy Toyotas until I'm put in the ground.  Why?  Because I won't spend the same amount of hard-earned money on a piece of garbage from Detroit that will rack up God knows how many dollars in needed repairs and eventually die on the side of the road.|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	The US auto industry committed suicide:      While American market took a sharp turn towards smaller, economical, reliable, fuel efficient vehicles, all that American car makers had to offer were overpriced, unreliable, fuel-guzzling vehicles with every bell and whistle imaginable.    This is the age of the Fit, Civic and Prius.   Detroit is still operating in the age of the Hummer.    The downfall of the US auto industry has NOTHING to do with unions, liberalism, or even going "green."     It was FAILURE TO RESPOND TO MARKET TRENDS AND CUSTOMER DEMANDS.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	I agree with shweebe. Unions drive up the cost of everything and do a piss poor job.

M3maZgdyaa	With the raise in taxes NONE it will be more expensive to give thousands of wall st. guys millions of dollars each or cap them and collect maybe 5 thousand less.    Between 2001 and 2004 (the most recent data), the percentage of federal income taxes paid by those with $200,000 incomes and above has risen to 46.6% from 40.5%. In other words, out of every 100 Americans, the wealthiest three are now paying close to the same amount in taxes as the other 97 combined. The richest income group pays a larger share of the tax burden than at anytime in the last 30 years with the exception of the late 1990s -- right before the artificially inflated high tech bubble burst.  Millionaires paid more, too. The tax share paid by Americans with an income above $1 million a year rose to 17.8% in 2003 from 16.9% in 2002, the year before the capital gains and dividend tax cuts.    The most astounding result from the IRS data is the deluge of revenues from the very taxes that were cut in 2003: capital gains and dividends. As shown in the nearby chart, capital gains receipts from 2002-04 have climbed by 79% after the reduction in the tax rate from 20% to 15%. Dividend tax receipts are up 35% from 2002 to 2004, even though the taxable rate fell from 39.6% to 15%. This is as clear evidence of a Laffer Curve effect as one will find: Lower rates produced increased revenues.    What explains this surge in tax revenues, especially at the high end of the income scale? The main factor at play here is the robust economic expansion, which has led to real income gains for most tax filers. Higher incomes mean higher tax payments. Between 2001 and 2004, the percentage of Americans with an income of more than $200,000 rose from 12.0% to 14.2%. The percentage of Americans earning more than $50,000 a year rose from 40.8% to 44.2% -- and that's just in two years. While these statistics are not inflation-adjusted by the IRS, price rises were relatively modest during these years, so adjusting wouldn't alter much.    We can already hear the left objecting that the rich are paying more taxes simply because they have hoarded all the income gains, while the middle class and poor wallow in economic quicksand. But, again, the IRS data tell a more upbeat story of widespread financial gains for American families. The slice of the total income pie captured by the richest 1%, 5% and 10% of Americans is lower today than in the last years of the Clinton administration.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	they'll get it back in corporate taxes that come from higher profits due to lower payroll...|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Not as much as the combined incomes of those service men and women that have lost their lives for a lie in Iraq, or no where near the cost to cover the amount of money being spent on the disabled troops that will continue for the rest of their lives.

The salary caps apply to companies that are receiving OUR money for a bailout. As the lenders, it's fair that WE get some concessions from them for the PRIVILEGE of using OUR money.     Now the kicker... since these institutions are receiving bailout money, the taxpayer is essentially subsidizing the operating costs (salary, etc.) of these businesses.  As a 'reward' for reducing the operating costs of these 'broke banks', taxpayers across the US should subsidize NYC?  So let me get this straight... the 'spread the wealth=socialism" crowd is suddenly OK with spreading the extra costs and for the rest of the US to spread the wealth to NYC??  That's just too silly and illogical!!  Please tell me how this is looking out for the 'average American'??|`|4ErIxkhyaa	This is all based on the premise that Wall St Elite actually pay Taxes.

May I suggest that the biggest mistake that Obama has/is making is putting to much trust in his col-cation, white, advisers.  I honestly believe that there are plans to watch him screw up.       On the other hand there is the possibility that there are politics involved in the appointment in any case I have every confidence that given time and God's Grace and Mercy Obama will prove to be, one of America's better presidential choices.|`|goHKCuyraa	What hasn't he done that wasn't on the dumb side?

So instead of helping they have actually made the warter problem worst.    I suggest we create a new government department that can deal with this.  If you notice when a witch doctor prescribes a pill, new or old that only have the same size.  Well does a 6' 2", 295 lb.,  ex Marine captain need to take the same amount as a 5' 2" lady?  I don't thin so.  So this new government department could make the industry make toilets in different sizes.    I believe if you went to ashington and had the Marine drin a six pack of beer the the petite young lady also, they would see that the young lady might get a little snockered and understand.    You can also tell them that the Merrill Lynch CEO that renovated his office with $1.22 million in that bailout money allowed the decorator to spend $843.000 on antiques of which the guy spend $34,000 for an antiqued legged toilet.  maybe he knew something and knew the old ones uesed a gallon.  So you can tell them that.    I suggest you invent a "toilet side bucket" in different colors. This bucket will be able to hold two gallons of water and you can pur it in and do the same job.  Also have it made in America!    One last thing you can do if they don't want to help you is invite them to a big dinner and make them stay overnite and they will then have to use that little toilet and find out first hand.  Do you really think our elected officials use them, no they have the big ones.    YOu know you may think this is funny but I know tons of people that are just as mad about as you and it is a waste of time, you think about all the time it takes just to stand there and wait to flush it again, you could bring this up and i bet some Congress people might no get reelected, I am serious as many poeple are mad about this    Also you can buy the new toilets with the jet flush and there's one on tv that the guy sees a good looking lady plumber and she goes next door so he goes in and drops all kinds of stuff in and it works everytime.  They also make one that you can put like 20 golf balls in and it works.  Only problem is they cost over $300, but the o ring is still 99 cents.  Hang in there.|`|45u7BzCUaa	It saves water, what are you complaining about?  *Sarcasm*  Most of the time you have to flush twice, so how you're saving water I don't know.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Well, not mine.  Bought it less than a year ago and paid an incredibly high price to get a modern one that actually works.  It does work, though, flushes every time no matter how large the movement.    Sometimes a higher priced item is worth every penny.|`|axHyoVqGaa	These new toilets are a joke. I specifically went out and looked for an older hi flow toilet to install in my home. I love it. One flush does the trick every time. When trying to flush solid waste, you end up having to flush the low flow toilets three of four times and it defeats the purpose. Sometimes, they even clog and nothing is more embarrassing than when it is a guest who has clogged it. I have wondered though about those toilets that have the tank separate from the bowl. I have seen pictures of them where the tank is mounted up at the ceiling and it has a pipe that runs down the wall where it connects to the bowl. I have never used one, but I was thinking that it might work with a lower capacity tank, because the water would have time to pick up much more speed and in the end I would think that it would result in a much more powerful flush. I wish I knew someone that had one. I would like to see it in action. If it worked well, I would put one in my home, simply because they are so different looking.

The cancer in Ginsberg was detected during an annual screening, that she has been undergoing since her battle with colon cancer shortly after she was placed on the Supreme Court by the Clinton Administration.  I don't think that Obama's choice to take Ginsberg's place, will pass the confirmation hearings if he picks one of his crooked friends from the Chicago political machine, that has been crooked since the days of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, where a bag of cash was delivered and favors were expected in return. Including upcoming raids or indictments on individuals.   Obama will have to select a list of people that he wants, and whittle down the list until he comes up with a candidate that he thinks will pass Senate confirmation hearings, so far, Obama's picks have all had skeletons in their closets that they wish would have remained there.  So, if he wants his choice to make it he will have to select those whom have untarnished reputations.
AA12103453	Well first this isn't the really the right section, however I will answer just a you'd probably get more answers in some other sections.   Tibet should be free. No Country should be forced under another's rule anymore. However there isn't too much that can be done. I don't see any armies trying to march in to China to free Tibet. China is too big to expect someone to try and take them on. Perhaps if the World teamed up they could go after China. The problem with that thought is that there aren't likely enough Countries that would take Tibet's side. Some would call this hypocritical of the U.S. anyway, after all we put Native Americans on reservations. We tried to eradicate their culture. Well our Govt was just as wrong then. Just because we were wrong doesn't mean it is right if someone else wants to do it. The shame is that China will take over Tibet, the Dali Lama can't live forever and the Chinese Govt has already forced it's way in to be able to name the new reincarnation of the Dali Lama. In other words they will lead Tibet and it will fall.|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	It should be but who wants to take on China?

The Immigration Dept. may not have gotten the "memo" that Obama will not interfere even should they kick her to the curb.  Maybe they are afraid he will retaliate in some way despite his statements.  They need to get off their duffs, get some guts, and do what they should.

RermzbWgaa	By requiring churches to hire homosexuals the only thing that will accomplish is to remove those churches from receiving government money (since the majority will not bend to that) and charitable programs that are working will be ceased.

However, that was said in July and what he does now might change so I will leave it at that.

HJaVcUGwaa	Gaza is the Stalingrad of the Palestinians.  It will be the start of the fall of the racist Zionists as Stalingrad caused the fall of the racist Nazis.    Listen to this Michael Heart song:  http://www.michaelheart.com/Song_for_Gaz...|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	The audience applauses,the ladies put handkerchieves to the eyes,the orchestra plays something solemn...There are only some details that throw the shadow of ignorance on your touching narration.  The battle of Stalingrad occured  between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943,so what has the initial phrase about how "1941 to 1942 were indeed one of the darkest days of the WW2" to do with the Stalingrad battle remains somewhat of a  mistery.  With al my respect,only someone who knows nothing about the balance of powers between the Stalins USSR and Hitlers Germany can call the Nazi Army   " one of the most advanced and fearless army of darkness the world has ever seen". As a matter of fact,on the 22nd of June of 1941 USSR had 24000 tanks against 3350 german ones(besides,the Soviet tanks were of much better technical characteristics).  In military planes,the balance was 21000 Soviet planes against 3200 German ones.  In artillery,the advantage of Russians was absolutely overwhelming.  Its not surprising,after we cleared the REAL balance of powers out,that the Soviet troops after recovering from the first blow broke the backbone of Hitlerism and eneded the war in Berlin;the technological advantage and the industrial potential of the Soviet Union did not leave to Germans any chances to win in the long war,and only a fool can dream of conquering such an immense country as Russia in a "blietzkreig".  Getting back to your analogy,this is what expects Hamas.The technological advantage of Israel and her industrial potential do not leave to Hamas, Hezbollah,Syria and any other combination of arab forces any chances to win in the  war against Israel.  For Arabs,Gaza is not Stalingrad of 1942,its Berlin of May,1945.And they are in the role of Germans.|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	The similarity is that by the time of Stalingrad, Hitler was deranged.    His generals begged him to let his soldiers leave before they were trapped.    General Paulus was offered terms of surrender twice, the first of which were generous, but he could not let the Fuehrer down. The result was that they were decimated.    Similarly, Hamas wants all their people to die fighting Jews.|`|vddPsXzIaa	I can't accept the point of view that Hamas is heroic. They killed lots of Palestinians themselves. By the way Israel doesn't attack the West bank where FATAH rules. They are peaceful and have good relationship with Israel.     Though your description is beautiful.|`|AA10690306	I hope now you understand that the lies and half truths Hamas has been trying to spread don't work for any person who thinks things through.  Clearly Hamas wants the Palestinians to die for them, when they clearly would not die for the Palestinians.  Israel started the cease fire alone because Hamas wanted to see more Palestinians dead and wounded.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The German Air force was not only bombing London pal, but Birmingham, bristol, Coventry, Cardiff. Coventry suffered more bomb damage than London,and Birmingham as well This is where the Arms factories were or as they were known, Royal ordinance Factories. You also had BSA in birmingham (british small arms factories) they took a real hammering.Bristol Docks, Cardiff docks were all nearly smashed by bombing raids as well as the Cities themselves. These were embarkation points for british and American troops. We also had more supplies in Britai from Canada than America. Virtually all the food supplies into Britain came from Canada via the North Atlantic convoys. America supplied war material.  Compared to the Battle for Stalingrad, Gaza was a little foray.The Russiand suffered over 2,000,0000 casualties of troops and civilians. The German army that surrendered totalled 375,000 troops, and that is not counting the casualties the German Army suffered which is about 150,000. You don't need a nuclear bomb to settle the gaza dispute, you need to finish Hamas off. Have you heard on the news that Hamas is stealing all the food sent into gaza for their own troops. There will never be peace in Palestine whilst Hamas are there.|`|goHKCuyraa	hard to answer such a flawed question.  Hate Israel much?|`|p9qf9gz0aa	No, the paralell is not the same.   why?  BECAUSE ISRAEL IS NOT A BUNCH OF RACIST PSYCHO ETHNIC CLEANSERS.  They are defended themselves from ROCKETS.  the nazi's killed because they hated anyone not like themselves.

Isreal is basically saying, we will remove the blockaid if you like, stop sending sucide bombers our way and attacking us, k?     Hamas is the reason for Palestine's misery, Isreal is only defending itself.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	The difference between Palestinians and Israeli in this conflict, is that the Palestinians want to destroy Israel, while Israel does not seek to destroy Palestine. Had it wanted to do so, it would have been done a long time ago.  It would rather be the other way around I think. Stalingrad stood fast in front of the most formidable war machine to that day, intent on a drive to the heart of the motherland: Moscow.  It is the Palestinians who will find their Stalingrad against the Israelis. Let them call a "victory" the outcome of the last conflict. Let the muslim countries supply them with arms and ammunition. Basically, the rest of the world will not let a new Holocaust happen, so that Israel has the support of the free world. And well-wishers who dream of the nuclear bomb, think about this: look-up the map. Nuke Israel and wipe it out. Then Egypt, Syria, Lebanon get the fallout. The land will be inhabitable for centuries to come. And everyone lose.|`|OhrysGKIaa	Gaza like Stalingrad?  That's funny.

If Israel were conquered, there would be such a mass genocide that the holocaust would just look like a rehearsal. Jewish people & other Israelites have been brought close to extermination long enough & deserve peace. Those of Hamas must stop sending rockets into Israel if they want the bombing to stop.

You blow every thing out of proportion and want to say it's racist if you disagree with a black president. I don't oppose obama cause he's black, I oppose him because he's a member of the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) which is just an organization that owns most of the main media outlets and who's only goal is to merge all the countries into one single tyrannical nation. And fyi, he's just as much white as he his black, but somehow ppl just want to label him as ONLY being African American...To me, that's as just as racist as Obama getting 95% of the black vote. If McCain got 95% of the white vote and only 5% of whites voted for Obama it would def. be considered racist, but no one cares once it becomes a double standard.  If you ask me, anything that's good for the goose and not the gander is more of a racist perspective than what whitey gets accused of. Maybe your the racist.

wig4qCeJaa	You have touch on a subject that escapes most people. The purpose of economic regulation is to enforce fair-trade, just like the purpose of laws is to enforce fair behavior.    But so many people have been brainwashed by their business heroes that they feel free trade is the only way to go.    It's kind of ironic that these people have no problem with laws that protect us from murderers, but are against laws that protect us from "economic murder".|`|KX1R4OQfaa	We don't have free trade with China,  see how well that is working out for us..

Or the government...?    Keep in mind that the government has already deemed it "fair" for a burglar injured while robbing a homeowner to sue that homeowner for damages...Keep in mind that the government has already deemed it "fair" for a good samaritan who comes to the aid of a heart attack victim to be sued by that victim for cracking a rib while performing life-saving CPR...

296b3ddd20aa6b7c48fb40d2c187aedfaa	Capitalism is deception about ownership of companies.    There are all new companies, stores, restaurants, and banks every 4 years and an average employment duration of 1 year within false economics capitalism, (that is possibly a secret homelessness-without-health insurance death camp). Remaining solvent does not actually exist within false economics capitalism.    Get rich quick schemes in the capitalist business world, (buyouts, IPOs, conglomerates, acquisitions, mergers, and the stock market), do not actually work. Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).    Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.    Capitalism is the psychology of imaginary parents, false economics, and the criminal deception of employees that are paying the bills (including the stocks and bonds, or shares) of companies.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Everyone has equal opportunities to succeed or fail.

I dunno....|`|6t76bgS3aa	First of all, I'm actually from Alaska and I don't want them here.  Second, you cannot be sure they won't escape or kill another prisoner or prison guard.  The only way you can be sure they don't murder someone else is to use capital punishment.  And finally and most importantly is the concept of justice.  Their victim is gone, but even in your situation the prisoner still will be able to enjoy eating food, feeling the water against their body in the shower ... that isn't right because the victim is dead.|`|rVnTnuU1aa	Nice thought, but bear in mind that the american people have to pay out each year to take care of these inmates and their upkeep in the prisons. I think the death penalty alone should be a good deterrent. If someone wants to still commit a crime that they could lose their life for, and they know this before hand, why not use the death penalty? If the potential convict  didn't care enough about the consequences, why should the american people? Why should we the people foot the bill to care for this inmate for the rest of their life?|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Neither serves as a deterent. If you want a deterent, make it so the death penatly actually happens within a year of the sentence. No one is afraid of the death penalty now because they know you will still have 12 to 25 years after your sentenced. You make it happen within 12 months of the sentence, things will change.|`|LU7WB6Poaa	It's a decent idea, but the only problem with doing away with the death penalty, is that tax payers will have to pay for housing, food, etc that the inmates receive.  Less inmates = less amt. of money tax payers have to contribute.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Someone still has to pay for that tundra prison.  And it would be us taxpayers. Personally, I don't want to pay for a murderer or child rapist or some other such inmate to be housed in the tundra any more than I want to pay for them to be housed in ANY prison.  And it certainly wouldn't be fair to the guards and other workers who would have to man the tundra prison, would it?   I am still all for the death penalty.  I just disagree with how the U.S. handles the death penalty.  If it were utilized in a more efficient and better way, it would be more of a crime deterrent than it is.|`|cbf5ef436bd348af732ccc7f87e069b9aa	Sorry, Guantanamo Bay is closing.|`|SiaWY5n2aa	i fully believe in the death penalty. if someone raped a little kid or murdered someone they should get killed in return. the lethal injection is too nice. electrical chair and firing squad are better. it sounds mean but someone needs to take a stand and give real punishment. what about the victims family? they should put a child molester in a room with the child's father for five minutes alone. give the father a bat and tie the guy to a chair. walk away and whatever the father does.......he does. we have too many people in prison that deserve to die for what they have done. but i also believe that everyone has the right to trial and a fair one at that. even if we out them in jail we still have to feed them and cloth them and let them bathe.|`|OP7lLIitaa	id rather cut off their arm for stealing their head for murder their penis for rape and if they escape cut their tendon in their heal and put all their asses to work on farms and highways with hand tools

AA12191521	I guess those other 7 states include China, India and Indonesia. Throw in Russia, the European Union, the entire continent of Africa, And I guess Australia. Maybe in all of those combined 500 million could lose their jobs in a year. But at the rate she implied the entire population of the Earth would be unemployed within 12 months. Some how I think she overestimated the problem.    Obama said during the campaign that he'd been to all 57 states except Alaska and Hawaii. For the record, the United States has 50 states and 5 territories. And yes he's an idiot too.    She was actually given the opportunity to amend her statement during an interview.

Not a verbal flub or a mixed up wire in her word dictionary........the FACTS are what is important here, and that is scary.    500,000 jobs lost a month is the legacy of Bush and the effect of Republican policy.     Argue semantics and misspellings and punctuation all you want.....I'm concerned with the facts, just like Obama and the current leadership of this country.

There are things in the "stimulous package" that some Republicans and Democrats don't really care for. This is why we have a Senate to begin with. They need to weed out the packages that aren't going to help make jobs and help the ecomony grow. Obama would just like the whole thing to pass, but that isn't going to happen. The Rep & Dem negative response to some of the package is actually supporting the President. The fact that both Dem and Rep don't completely agree on the package is actually a good thing. It means both parties are seeing eye-to-eye for the first time in decades. Obama know there has to be compromise on this. They'll get it fixed. Even when this launches the ecomony isn;t going to be fixed in a few days. It took Bush 8yrs to screw the economy up. Do people think Obama can fix it in a few days?

It's a cultural institution isn't it? Doesn't it get money each year from the local and state government(Or federal since it's in D.C.) anyways? I'm Ok with them not cutting funding for the Smithsonian, but why do they need more money and how is it going to help the economy?  -$1 billion for the 2010 Census, which has a projected cost overrun of $3 billion. It takes years to setup a Census, so isn't the money for the 2010 census already set? Plus, shouldn't the census be a low priority?  -A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion picture film. Last time I checked the movie industry was doing just fine. Why do they need money?  -$100 million for reducing the hazard of lead-based paint. What does "reducing hazard of lead-based paint" even mean?    That is just a small sample of the waste. Plus, the stimulus package doesn't address how all of this money is going to be accounted for.

They are earned benefits, not a form of social services that are universally available from the government.    I had a similar experience 20 years ago at about your point in life when I did not apply for Unemployment benefits when I was temporarily laid off from a job do to a work slowdown - I didn't want a "handout" either.  It had to be explained to me that unemployment insurance was paid for by my employer and were benefits which I had earned.    No need to feel guilty for making use of any benefit which you worked for and earned honestly.    Best of luck to you and your college experience.

And what's pathetically ironic is that they're the ones who feel entitled.|`|noo8vpvzaa	VA Compensation = Job perk, work benefit    Welfare = Free money for sitting on your @ss, NOT working    Definitely not the same thing|`|uithGZOwaa	No,  it's not the same thing.    VA benefits are compensation for services rendered.    Welfare is suppose to be temorary help until someone can get back on their feet.    Two totally different things.    Thank you for your service to our country.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I see VA compensation is more like a benefit of being in the military, so compensation for a job or career just like your paycheck.  I would consider it a handout or welfare if you had done nothing to earn it or if it was like unemployment benefits where it's available to everyone, but I think VA compensation is more along the lines of the health coverage, pensions and other benefits being in the military gets you.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	Heck no, they aren't the same.  You served your country and were injured in the line of duty.  The VA payments you receive are for services rendered.|`|wig4qCeJaa	Consider the compensation as an award for your service to our country.    Thank you, by the way.|`|2b3ihDVuaa	You have some real valid points; but if you truly don't need the money send it back to the treasury.  I, on the other hand, certainly need what I'm getting.|`|TfZBBOovaa	Not at all. VA compensation is not welfare. Welfare is for lazy people that just want to rip off the government and waste billions of tax payers dollars
AA11305474	The reason Americans are entitled to receive social security and medicare is because they have paid into them.  Can you imagine if we relied only on pensions from companies (many no longer offer them and many are bankrupt) or IRAs or 401k plans?  No one would be able to retire and no one would have health care in their old age.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Social Security should go back to being for retirement purposes only and not the gravy grab for every leech who can fake an illness or injury.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, increase taxes on the rich, both income and capital gains. Stop spending on war, police, drug interdiction and the military, nationalize the banks, and spend more money on the needy, including on health prevention which pays for itself eventually. Also limit the use of lights and other combustibles.|`|AA11524578	Because they are entitlements.    Exactly what else are we supposed to call them?|`|R0NdLzynaa	OK, what are they then?  I can't find that specific unalienable right.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	They're not only entitlements, but a Ponzi scheme.  What we're paying in now goes to those who are already retired.  Maddoff looks like a Boy Scout next to the SS and Medicare programs.    Doing away with them would be a huge huge HUGE help.    And yes, this comes from someone eating PBJ sandwiches, but I know a handout when I see one and I'll manage without.|`|AA11537248	Because they are.    Where in The Constitution does it say that you are guaranteed a pension and health care?
kMYE3vV8aa	My opinion, it is just another brainwash tactic to make you all think he is doing something great!    First of all, I do not want my government interfering in private business and telling them what to do.  Don't you people see that as wrong?  It is socialist leaning towards communism!    Second, before he goes after private business why doesn't he first clean up his own dirty backyard?  Our government stinks of highly overpaid people who do nothing all day but steal our tax dollars.  For Gods sake, I care a lot more about cleaning up Washington then I do about private business.      It just amazes me how people can sit around saying Obama is doing great things when he really isn't.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	My problem with this is that it ONLY applies to companies in the bailout.    I'd like a system where ALL CEO's could ONLY get bonuses through job creation.   Give them an incentive to find a business model that creates GOOD jobs.      Right now we have a system where CEO's benefit from trashing the employees.   Firing 10,000 means the stock goes up...and they are doing good.    Cutting benefits for employees means the CEO gets rewarded.    We need to reverse their incentives here, cause the system is working against the greater good.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	People that are saying this are 99% lost losers who doped off in school and are now jealous of those that made it in the world of business. Maybe if you folks had studied more than social bs classes you might have been at the top and making the big bucks right now. But then maybe not.  Mostpeople that are agreeing with Obama over this would want the hard work to get there.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Unfortunately, most of these CEOs have contracts which pay them the bonuses and stock options even if they do a lousy job!!!  When the Board of Directors fires one of them, he still gets his bonus and stock options because of the contract he made with the company when he came on board.  Same deal even if the corporation goes bankrupt.    I don't see any deals like that for the company's employees!!!    I think it is great that Obama is making the salary cap a condition for receiving federal funds.   It's about time somebody started making some rules regarding bailouts!|`|9w9UHyCNaa	He has already put a $500k cap on all of the CEO''s executive-pay for those receiving funds from the stimulus.|`|AA11828439	"About time"? He has only been in office two weeks!|`|dfo8gSaraa	Yes.  I'm all for free market. But, when they're using OUR TAX DOLLARS to line their pockets then YES we SHOULD have a say in what happens.    IMO, it's more incentive for them to get back on their feet quicker. Otherwise, they'll bleed us dry (like Iraq is doing).|`|2Hlctljgaa	I don't like ANY government involvement limiting salaries.  It's too communist.  I think it's up to the board of directors to limit the salaries and not the government.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Why doesn't he do something about Congress?|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I'd like to point out that it's possible that a CEO can do a good job, yet the company might still not make a profit in a given quarter or a year.  Looking at the entire company's performance is not the best way to evaluate a CEO.  It's more complicated than that.    I agree that limiting pay for companies that are being funded by taxpayers is a good way to send a message to those companies that this is not a free ride.|`|13fDE4nGaa	Change has come to a nation that has been run by Thief's for a very long time.    Mc donald employee they feel are over paid.    But it is totally ok for them to steal billions from the     American people|`|V0qWtXOtaa	they will still make the same amount of money they just won't be reporting it in the same way|`|V44ARW4maa	good for him|`|ZvfUQ4Ifaa	na i disagree. he shouldnt have any say about how much a company pays its employees. thats not fair. i bet when the company tells the ceo they gotta take a pay cuy, they just quit and go work for someone else. then that company is really going under
59iSPST0aa	You will still have to pay your credit card and mortgage, but I really don't know where the money will go.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	We'll be in big trouble !|`|2si53dCRaa	Im not sure, but definately know you will not be getting anything free.|`|BqXSymxjaa	The money will still go to B of A. It definitely won't be wiped away, but you might be able to re-negotiate your loan.
AA10118655	No, the next round is suppose to be tax cuts. You probably will see about $40 more in your paycheck when/if it passes.|`|jar8EIelaa	Working class = $0  High level CEO's and Obama friends  =  1Trillion, and a free ride for tax evasion.    There's the Hope and the Change.|`|RjUhISEIaa	nothing for us except tax cuts...no check in 2009...sorry|`|9twZdl6laa	Sorry, Amber...you're not getting a check.|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	Not going to happen this year.|`|VyLXMBtcaa	working man $0  Pork millions to billions

When the economy starts to improve, Gordon will want to try to take credit for it.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	because they  would, from browns position, make the wrong choice. but to be honest i don't think any politician will solve our present problems until the public feels confidence return.|`|YHPYg7pWaa	Unfortunately for Gordon Clueless Brown and indeed the country  there is a dark sinister figure who is leading Gordon by the nose and that person is Peter Mandelson.  Since his return to mainsteam British politics. a dark sinister shadow has appeared over the Labour Party at Westminster.So much so that the Labour Members of Parliament can be compared to some frightened timid children who are frightened to have a flu jab.  To my way of thinking,Gordon 'Crash' Brown will call a General Election when the Emperor Ming of British politics Peter Mandelson tells him.|`|61YfPllfaa	Ha ha Croxx you got that about right mate. ave a star.|`|NnY1wG11aa	Because its not Labour policy to do what they say.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	Labour may not 'support' it but they did nothing to stop renditions and illegal transportations as well as torture.|`|HIkXnqfzaa	He wont call an election until later in the year  when everyone is really about to string him up.    he knows he will loose, he came in through the back door and was never elected in the first place and i don't think  he would of won on place of blair    labour have done it again the same as last time, it was the tories who sorted out the mess last time.

And there not stealing americans jobs anyways because Americans would not do war illegals do for work. Pepole needs face reality. Ohhh but reality hurts at time!? LOL but they can keep moanin and groaning illegals are going to come and keep coMing! And criminals? Do you no how many african Americans and white pepole are in jail? Let alone rapist, child moestors,scammers,cheat on their taxes,drive with no insurance or drivers l , neglect their children, and many more things?      TO MAMOUR- ME ILLEGAL?

That used to be the biggest joke. But in fair to your question. It is not being competitive, it is being greedy.  If one gets hurt, just get another. who is going to complain. Welcome back to the 1900'S. Sweatshops.|`|Ubb9HuApaa	I own a costruction company.  1. illegals are lazy as can be, they don't understand you and they don't take pride in their work.    2. They often can't find rides to work and often go days without showing up, that's when we fired them.    3. They have no desire to better themselves by learning english thus have terrible work ethics.    4.They cost less, but do shoddy work so in the end, it costs us more.    Needless to say, We do not hire illegals anymore, just no worth it.|`|AA11327039	I wouldn't even say they work for low wages.  Most employers are descent people and want to pay fair wages.  The working world (American citizens) starting suffering when the unions took over.  I understand fair pay and getting breaks and not working endless hours.  In that aspect the union is a good idea, but when they started talking more and more and more pay, that's when it got ridiculous.  Seriously now, I know a guy (who does have a college degree) but works at GM putting the little decal stickers on the cars and gets paid around $40 an hour.  Half the time he's drunk as are his workmates.      Personally I think they have priced themselves out of jobs.  If you're asking for $40 to do something that simple, you're a crook.  If the illigeal down the street will do the same job for just $10 cash per hour, then that's fair in my book.  At least a few jobs are kept on American soil.|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	I don't think it's very smart of the worker to work for no benefits, weekends and holidays or breaks (which workers are allowed by law).  The employer is living in a big expensive house, buying new cars every 3 years, taking vacations and has no cash problems and he's working his employees like slaves. Something is wrong with that picture, on both sides.  You keep talking about how on time they are and their strong work ethic. I believe that has little to do with why they are hired. They are hired because they work weekends (without overtime pay), holidays, and no benefits. It saves the employers thousands of dollars every year per worker.      I can't believe you would think this is a good think for your illegal friends. You are basically committing them to slavery.|`|AA11966821	No, it is not fair, honest or accurate.  There are only two reasons for hiring illegal aliens: the employer wants cheap, untaxed, under-the-counter labor, or the employer has been deceived by an illegal alien identity thief.|`|AA12365543	1. They don't demand anything, they usualy are not long term workers anyways, just 1 day to a few months.    2. Not always.  Lots of times they sleep at work    3. Some do, some don't.     4. Depends on which industry you work in. Demolition you will never hire an illegal, construction you probably will.    They are usualy paid the same wage, the issue is you can basically treat them like garbage and they take it. Also you can cheat them out of there money after they did the job.    And the big issue(in construction atleast) is if they get hurt on the job you can dump them at the hospital and the tax payer deals with the bill, while with an American worker you need to pay workmans comp. And for female illegals, they accept sexual harassment more often.    One time some aluminum fell into the ocean and our boss had the illegals go fish it out.  At Dunkin Donuts the manager was having sex with lots of the illegal females.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	Greasy tony....  that is a joke !   no, they do not show up on time,   not all have transportation,therefore miss work.  work ethics? how so? first of all? you would need to understand English in order to do a job ?  competitive? OMG !!!!!the market is screwed up,thanks to illegals!  low wages? just by the fact they do NOT pay taxes? they live better than the minimum wages in the US!  and to   AntiObam     who in the world are you to talk to US citizen as you do ? you are probably ILLEGAL ! just read your English ...pffft    i have never needed Welfare, food stamps or any help from the   Gov.i have worked all my life, paid taxes,   finished college, and had a Gov. job,  but  what have you done in the US and for the US ? NADA .....!  want to go look at the lines at welfare? and all US freebies? who do you see there? bingo!|`|VyU2d8Ohaa	No it's not fair. i think they rely on illegal immigrants because they will work hard and don't have to pay much. whatever they're paying the them their not being taxed.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	I think its true for some industries and in some regions.  To what extent, I have no idea.  Its probably more than some claims and less than others.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	No it's not fair but it does show your contempt for your fellow Americans that you place below your criminal friends.|`|vRY2vExRaa	Yes it is fair to say that, except that your points 1-4 are true because the illegal has no choice BUT to do that.  When I lived in Southern Colorado  there were huge agribusiness firms that imported illegals for farm work.  They were kept in dorms, worked long hours, were paid below  minimum wage and had their "costs of living" deducted from their pay.  Some folks in the valley objected to the treatment of the illegals and were harassed out of the valley.  A sad but TRUE tale.|`|vet4adaYaa	1-4 are all lies, unless you can prove me wrong.  We all know defending your criminal friends is hard Tony, stooping to the level of outright lies really makes you lose any/little creditability you might have had before.|`|Vpq8CZQHaa	Far from it because they are both US law breakers.  It is fair to say it is all about the money for both, the illegals and the companies that skirt our laws.  It is also fair to say, any business whose very existence/survival is based upon these flawed notions, particularly the use of the illegal alien also has a flawed business plan.  If these companies would go under without the illegal alien invader working for them, then so it should be.  Perhaps the CEO's should not rake in the big bucks at the expense of the US citizen worker/consumer/taxpayer!    The job market is going to become much more fierce and one can expect those here illegaly to become further targets for removal, as it should be.|`|BgExwcvMaa	Back before the housing slow down, I was working 10-12 hr days, sometimes till 10:00 at night, most times after 6:00 PM I was the only one working in the subdivision. With the amount of illegals working construction, and the work ethics you say they have, you would think I would have seen, or heard someone. I lost count of the times I was stopped from doing my job because an immigrant crew failed a building code inspection due to their job wasn't done right,or done on time.  Anyway,  1) Borders on communistic slavery.  2) I, and most people I know show up on time, and everyday.  3) No better, or doesn't equal mine or most I know.  4) Creates unfair advantage, What your talking about is called cut throat bidding, not staying competitive, and they get hired because they will work under slave conditions.
62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	Do you mean before getting a Canadian passport?     When you become a citizen, you can change your name at that time so that the new Canadian passport will be issued in the new name. There is a section on the application forns that allows you to write in a new name if you so choose.      BUT you must have lived in Canada for 3 years as a PR before you can apply. Citizenship is currently taking anywhere up to 2 years to be processed.

I voted for him, I support him.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	Honestly, I didn't vote for him.  I am a moderate conservative, so my personal views and values are more in line with Senator McCain's views.  I campaigned on behalf of Senator McCain, so I was disappointed when he lost.    However, President Obama is now the President of all Americans, and I hope that he makes good decisions and leads us well, and I will judge his actions with an open mind.  I will always give him the respect that I feel should be afforded to any President of the United States.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	i am ecstatic. time will tell if he is able to accomplish what he wants to.

Others will adore him no matter what he does/doesn't do. These people are called loyalists. And finally, there are those that will give him time (he needs it) to undo the mess made by the previous administration, and judge him on his preformance (good or bad). These people are called historians.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	I think he is doing alright and it is amusing to see all the right-wingers here attack him knowing that they have so very little power to actually do anything about it.|`|EJVKqFiHaa	You must be a sheep.

A black guy! and he hasn't changed anything!'|`|AA11106831	That is why it is critical that this get done asap.  Or the ratings will be even lower for the bill and Obama.  And we know this is not allowed.|`|rnNoD1braa	No, not that surprising.    The Republican Party is doing everything it can to prevent progress within the U.S.    After spending 8 years investing in other countries, you'd think they'd wake up and smell the goddamn coffee, and realize it's time to invest in our own country for once, before it implodes.    Bush-a Republican-tried a stimulus bill before he left. And as expected, the Republican's attempt was crap. No regulations, etc. CEOs took tropical vacations. And everybody acted surprised.  It was hardly discussed what was in that bill. And McCain, of course, approved of it.    And now, oh so ironically, the Republicans want to tear this one apart, acting the part of the moral crusaders. Give me a goddamn break.    With intellectually-challenged people like Rush Limbaugh, praying our government fails, to John McCain playing the "I told you so" card, I don't think we're going to see much progress for a while.    People, rooted in fear and worry, are again letting these dimwitted neo-cons into their homes and allowing them to shove their half-assed criticism and distorted perception down our throats and into our brains.    I laugh it all, really. I know what needs to be done, I just wish more politicians were willing to take a risk. Put a foot forward and test the waters. We're not going to get anywhere if we just ***** about every little move Obama's administration makes. Sure, there are flaws, and we're going to make mistakes. We have to be willing to act and learn from the aftereffect, no matter the outcome.     This isn't meant as an angry diatribe towards the person asking this question...just commenting.    Oh, and thanks Bush, for one hell of a mess.  Hope you enjoy Texas and those ten gallon hats.  ~Kane|`|vtafeEIJaa	I understand your idea, the shakers have a similar one|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Obama started to plead his case of not being effective even before he was sworn in.

See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.    9 Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. 10 And then many will fall away [1] and betray one another and hate one another. 11 And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.|`|KMcUHkpgaa	i dont know, lets pray!|`|ad3ORARNaa	Yes, the last star is expected to go cold in 100 trillion years.

SaxjkMbSaa	I am more concerned about the 19  masochistic states that were stupid enough to pay Franken money to be " entertained " by him ?|`|cZypvAK8aa	Frankenstein doesn't have the decency to drop out.

D'oh.|`|AA10264185	Still in the running? Al Franken is the elected Senator from Minnesota.  This article from May 2008 says that Franken overpaid his taxes in the states that he was a resident of and still owed taxes in other states. He said he would pay what he owes and by now he has. Sounds like someone who hired the wrong accountants not a tax cheat.|`|pM81f5tnaa	He's still in the running because people voted for him.|`|esgR6ayzaa	1.     The Republican (Fake) Version    Al Franken evaded taxes in 17 states and then lied about it. He's getting rich by cheating on his taxes while the rest of us have to pay our fair share. How can Minnesotans trust someone who doesn't even pay his taxes?       2.    The Non-Fake Version    Al Franken paid state and federal income tax on every cent he ever earned, right down to the 11-cent residual checks for re-runs of "SNL." Due to an accounting error, he overpaid his state taxes in some states and underpaid them in others  but he didn't benefit financially. As soon as he found out about the mistake, he immediately resolved it  even though none of the states where he underpaid ever asked for the money.    And Al showed some serious leadership. His team found out about the error before the GOP did, he corrected it right away  then he offered immediate disclosure. And DFL delegates found out about it before they read it in the paper because this campaign put together a 100 person phone bank in an hour to tell them.    This is how a candidate should behave.    Al Franken has never shied away from taking on the Republican smear machine, and we're not going to start now. We will fight this and every other battle tooth and nail between now and November.    If you ever hear, read, or see the Fake Version of this story, we need you to help us do what Al does best: tell the truth.|`|1NO10YfPaa	Because he got the votes.|`|FbOsO0WEaa	Oh get a life.

KUnDQfBGaa	Ever heard of the 'Neutron Bomb'? It's a nuclear weapon where it releases a small explosion,but still spreads out its radiation just like a regular nuclear weapon,resulting in millions of deaths from radiation fallout.but somehow keeps the infrastructure intact somehow.  As for ending wars, I feel that's about the only war wars can end nowadays,besides keep on fighting until everyone is exhausted from it. It is said wars aren't won or lost. It's what ever side that exhaustes themselves the fastest loses.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	the alternative to ending war, is keep fighting the war. I think you might wish to rewrite this question.  email me and I will gladly help.|`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	the alternatives were blockade the Japanese until they surrendered. In short starve them to death. Invade the country with literally millions of casualties. bomb them conventionally with fire bombs until nothing is left above ground. Next allow the emperor to retain his position for the countries surrender something the folks back home wouldn't have supported. The Bomb on the other hand had no real draw backs except the radiation poisoning that really wasn't understood yet. Even if it had I doubt that would have stopped the president from dropping it. You have to realize that firebombing was racking up as many casualties as the A-bomb the difference being that the A-bomb only needed 1 plane the other way 100's of planes and 1,000's of bombs.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	Atomic bombs kill innocent people, including women and children.|`|F3Bzs9CLaa	The problem with atomic bombs is that its use may be portrayed as an excuse for a nation to retaliate with the same amount of force.|`|Bkl0515eaa	An alternative to ending the war would have been a simple blockade.  Japan is an island nation and its strategic offensive capability is based on naval power projection.  By 1945 the Japanese Navy was destroyed.  We had 30 heavy aircraft carriers (Essex class and similar) to their none.  We had 10 new battleships (Iowa, North Carolina, South Dakota classes) and 12 older battleships (Colorado and Pennsylvania classes) to their none.  We had hundreds of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines to their less than fifty.  We had 30,000 aircraft to their 5,000, with 30,000 more in Europe.  We had 30 million tons of merchant ships to their less than 1 million tons.  The US Navy had Japan completely surrounded, and nothing was getting in or out.  We could have maintained this straglehold for year or decades with no trouble.  But we wanted revenge for Pearl Harbor, and a prolonged blockade just woudn't give us that satisfaction.    Using any type of weapon in deliberate, indiscriminate attacks against civilians was and is against the rules, customs, and laws of war, as described in the Geneva Conventions, Hague Conventions, a 1938 League of Nations Resolution, and the Just War tradition of the Roman Catholic Church dating back hundreds of years. The purpose and effect of the bombs was to cause as much civilian death and devastation as possible in order to intimidate the Japanese government into surrender. This fits the following definition of terrorism: the use or threat of use of violence against noncombatants in order to intimidate or coerce their government into making political concessions.    Some may argue that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were in fact military targets, containing manufacturing facilities, and in the case of Nagasaki a naval base. But then, why were the bombardier aiming points the exact centers of both cities? It would be the functional equivalent of aiming for Staples Center in Los Angeles to take out Raytheon 10 miles to the west and JPL 10 miles to the Northeast, along with hundreds of thousands of civilians in between. Or aiming for downtown Norfolk to take out Norfolk Naval Base 5 miles to the north.|`|f02r2IGraa	The bomb will put an end to the prior.

XTDeAfTqaa	Obama should have been aborted.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	I've never heard him give a speech in which he "promotes" abortion.  What's up with that???|`|AA11963685	Nobody "promotes" abortion.  He is pro-choice. He wants to work to reduce the number of abortions performed in this country through effective education instead of using the abysmal failure of abstinence only programs. He believes that partial birth abortion should only be performed when the mother's physical life is in real danger. He refused to sign the bill put forth in Illinois protecting fetuses born alive not because he thinks they should die but because there was already a bill protecting them and the new bill was nothing but an attempt by pro-lifers to get language put through that might lead to challenging Roe v Wade. Smart guy not to fall for their obvious sneakiness. But of course they ignore the real reason and try to claim he wants dead babies. They are despicable people in my opinion.    I'm always bemused by people who object to the rare instance of a woman needing an abortion to save her life. I often wonder if their sister was pregnant and the doctor's said she would die if they didn't terminate how they would really react. She can have more children, but they can only bury their sister once. What's up with people who would make a choice to let her die? That's revolting.|`|9FI7zaKraa	he is already killing our economy, and freedoms. why not our children? why stop at 9months? lets make it ok to kill until 18yrs.|`|ODDmWvn5aa	Whoo hoooo!

He loves killing babies what is so hard to understand about that?|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I think abortion is a terrible thing but sometimes necessary.  I certainly wouldn't want to see it outlawed.

He isnt promoting it though|`|DbuGVrWUaa	I think men should shut the hell up about abortion to start with! Once they understand the real emotional strain a woman is put through they may think twice about it!  For some females abortion is the only answer  Birth control is never completely affective! What if you are that person that ends up pregnant after using all protection, why then can you not have the chance to abort!  A baby is only a baby when it is born! Before then it is a fetus, nothing more nothing less.     If someones life is at risk from a child are you going to say they must have the child who may also die, and die them selves or are you going to give them the chance?    If a rape victim is pregnant are you going to make them have a constant reminder of it crying, puking and pooping everyday of their life??    Obama can think what he likes who are you to try and tell people what to do and think!|`|eGsNFUeiaa	I don't know how he would be "with" abortion    You need hooked on phonics...

There are pet projects in the stimulus package for infrastructure and other things that create jobs.

Now Obama is stimulating only big labor unions, and trial lawyers, while expanding the government with federal jobs, which will ensure liberalism will triumph for decades.|`|V44ARW4maa	perhaps it's you that is mistaken and not everyone else?

We've got to trust someone to figure this mess out and the American people made their choice.  I for one am inclined to see how well this works before getting hysterical about it.  What was our other choice?  A man who admitted he knew next to nothing about the economy and told us all that our economy was fundamentally sound literally just hours before Wall Street imploded.  No thank you.  Obama may be wet behind the ears but he has the best minds in this country working with him.|`|UzRijICuaa	NOOOOOOOOOOO|`|6dd5d27e0f45ba1c5b9fcec4b0576716aa	This 'bailout' is a complete and utter joke and waste of money. If you look at all the things on which they plan to spend money, about 12 cents of every dollar will actually stimulate the economy. The rest is just pork and a waste of taxpayers money.     I would like to see which bright Democratic minds were working on this one. Not enough brightness in their bulbs to light up a closet.    To answer your question, the bailout needs to have a complete overhaul. If it doesn't get that, then I don't want it to pass.

Now FEMA has been building these underground "compounds" all throughout the northwest, about 800 at last count.  They say, "for disaster recovery",others say prison camps. Now, the US has the largest prison population in the world right now, and with all the new "arrestable offenses" the "patriot act" has brought us, It won't be long before those compounds are full.  Back, a few hundred years ago, traders were doing there thing in Africa, when they noticed the slave market, ya see, they didn't have big fancy prisons for there "bad" people, so they made slaves out of them. the traders thought "hey that would be a big hit back in the states". Today, China is the trader, only we're in hock up to our eye balls, but we have a bunch of "labor" we can give them.  Sound familiar?  And, don't tell me, "we can't do that". The government has done far worse, and gotten away with it, and, hey, the Amerikan people want the debt payed, so, it's either your land, or those criminal's, then they're gonna say " boy we really don't want to do this, but, we see no other choice". So, we'll just give them a few, and see how it goes, and we'll turn complete control over to the court's. Just to be sure it's fair, and constitutional, you understand.

fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	a opening to explain his case is necessary and some facts to why the child will be best with him also for when he ask but all that other stuff is really unnecessary he will ask questions aboutt things he wants to know about but he hears cases like this all day he just wants to get it over and done with.  i really think you need to let your fiance handle it your not married to him and the judge will look at you like your a idiot if you start talking for him.  if the mother doesn't show up to the court they will not put a warrant out for arrest this is not a criminal case she doesn't have to show up... but your fiance will automatically get a ruling in his favor unless the judge reschedules the case date.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Opening and closing statements are needed for formal hearings and trials.    You make an opening saying what the case is about and what the evidence you provide will prove.  Your closing statement is your argument - what the evidence HAS proven and why you are therefore entitled to have your legal request granted.    "judge and he likes courtesy and preparation"  ...which means that he doesn't want a legal show and tell.  He wants both sides to present organized, coherent and substantive statements from both sides.  He's looking for sincerity.  If your presentation is too slick, it's going to backfire.  He's going to want to pay attention to what people say.  If you spend more time on how it's said, he may lean to the side that sounds most orally disadvantage and handicap it.    "' well he ain't been around my baby so he ain't my baby daddy' (literally that's what she would say...)"  But what does that mean and why is it important?  Do you even know?  This could be an example of what I said, judging people on how they sound rather than what they say.    "So I would assume that it would go a long way with this judge for my fiance to introduce his case in a formal opening"  If that were the best way to go, the judge would have probably required that you have attorneys.  It sounds like he's trying to simplify the way that each side gets its points across.  he will probably give each side the opportunity to respond to what the other side says.    "Isn't it true that if she does not then there will be a warrant for her arrest?"  This typically happens in criminal cases.  If you fail to appear, a warrant is issued.  Since family court is a civil venue, a wrrant is unlikely - he could enter default judgement in your fiance's favor - however since the underlying rule is side in the best interests of the child, he'd probably adjourn the case for the mother to show up.

AA11163314	How do you explain the (literally) hundreds of eyewitnesses who watched the plane hit the Pentagon?    1) The video of the first plane hitting the WTC was taken by pure chance.  Because of the first plane hitting there was massive media coverage of the buildings when the second plane hit.  Now what you need to do is explain why there should have been news media cameras on the Pentagon when all the news was in New York.    2)  The video was off of a security camera that was covering the outside wall of the building.  There is no reasonable reason for the Pentagon security department to have had their security cameras pointing at the sky.    3)  The site was a plane crash/crime scene.  In either case the quick collection of possible evidence is necessary before it can be disturbed by other emergency responders.    4)  There were plenty of pictures of plane parts.

I thought every U.S. citizen 18 and older would get $2000-$3000 a piece. Maybe I heard it wrong on the news.     The main problem with the stimulus package is there is money going to businesses and people who don't need it. This is why the Senate are very relunctant on passing it. Not sure what the hell Pelosi was doing, but the package really needs to be fixed and cost should be below 700 billion. The U.S. is already trillions of dollars in debt thanks to Bush.

You only THINK it's stupid because you don't understand.    Uh, putting people to work reduces unemployment, and puts cash circulating throughout the economy, keeping businesses in business, so fewer people lose their jobs.    Since most of the money will go toward improving and repairing infrastructure, it will also save individuals, businesses, and the government piles of money over time.    It's not Obama's fault that 28 years of Republican rule have nearly destroyed the country.    Yes, if we don't hire lots of people, and spend lots of money, more businesses will go under, and more people loose their jobs, continuing a downward spiral.    Since the Republicans are determined to prevent our recovery, so they can blame the Democrats and thereby win elections in 2010, people need to be made to understand the seriousness of the problem, and what needs to happen to avoid complete melt-down, so they'll scream loud enough even the deaf, dumb, blind, and completely stupid Republicans know they'll pay the price for preventing recovery.|`|V7JVKApkaa	I never had any question of that.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Bush was not an idiot.

When you have a party so controlled by so many special interests you often get in trouble trying to appease them all and show some gratitude for their support.

One of the reasons the economy is tanking is because Americans are not spending.    Our economy is based on spending, when the people do not have the money to spend (because of unemployment and inappropriate salary) who else will take it on if not the state. The corporations and capitalists don't do it.  The package is the best we have.

iT4OO8Gsaa	The problem in America is greed.  A good start would be as follows:    1.  We need strict regulations for the banking industry and Wall Street.    2..  All mortgages should be 6% fixed year mortgages.  Banks cannot be allowed to screw over the working man by charging high interest on home loans to cover up for the bad management now running the industry.    3.  Credit cards should also have a cap of 10% interest period.  No more variable rates and no changing the terms of the agreement.    4.  For Wall Street strict regulations need to be put in place to control hedge funds and speculators.

Those of us who played by the rules, put 25-30% down on our homes, didn't speculate and borrow against it's value during the boom times, saved for college and retirement, didn't live beyond our means and build up huge debts, should not be the ones who pay for the financial meltdown.  But as the states run out of money, contend with huge deficits, and snoot around for who is going to bail them out of their wild spending, it is the taxpayer who still has a job and played by the rules because we are the only ones with real money left even if we have to work an additional 10 years to make up for what we lost in our investment accounts during the meltdown THEY caused.|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	http://www.halturnershow.blogspot.com/20...|`|vtafeEIJaa	$35 billions arms trade on the way....|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	The economy does cycle on its own.

You see,democracy is the essence of the majority to determine what and how; and to advocate for their needs. Without the concept of the majority a state is empty.And for India,democracy is has made it good. It has made it for the people

z2mpC5NDaa	regardless of what you steal... it is wrong and you broke the law  if your brave enough to brake the law.....  then....  you should be brave enough to take the consequence.....    don't start running away from problems....  go back to the store... aplogize to the owner, pay for the gatorade.... you will feel much better.....|`|zmmP52P3aa	Too bad you aren't a Congressional Democrat, the DNC would go to bat for you, hiring lawyers and impeding any investigations in Congress and finally refusing to punish you despite obvious guilt (like they did with Bubba).|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Yes you will probably be caught. However, a 1.50 gatorade will not get you arrested. Hopefully you learn a lesson from all of this so as to not get into real trouble another time.|`|goHKCuyraa	You broke the law.  Do your self a big favor and go back to the store and give the owner an apology and pay for the gatoraide whether you actually took it or not.

Sometimes doing what is right seems hard-but show some character and do it.    doesn't matter if the owner knows what you look like-you have to look at yourself in the mirror everyday.  Do what is right and you will be a much better man.|`|8t2f3W2Yaa	at worst you will get banned from the shop , dont worry about it,  mean it was only a bottle of gatorade.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	There's a pretty big chance that you'll get caught.

This is supposed to be a 700,000,000,000.00 (seven hundred billion dollar bail out.) More if you choose to calculate some add-ons and interest. And this does not count the 1st bail out in September.    In economic theory it should provide for 7 million Jobs. The US currently has about 3.5 million unemployed.     Of course this is the point where you realize the economic stimulus package isn't really for a mass creation of Jobs, its for Pet projects across various states and other countries by the way and to pay back those who put Obama in office.
42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	Your mother had a contract with the seller which the buyer was obviously aware of. The new owner of the house has to fulfill the rest of the lease, or if there is no written lease they have to give her 30 days notice.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Yes, they have to give her at least 30 days notice. This happened to the tenant of the house we bought. She claimed 30 days wasn't enough time for her to find a new place and move. It set us back so the owner had to pay our rent until we were able to buy the house and take up occupancy.|`|FxAD44Moaa	no, they have to tell you..

You can also call the court house and the child support agency in your area and see what they can recommend. Just call around and don't be afraid to be persistent. Don't be rude, because you will need all the help that you can get in the court toom, but don't just take no or I don't know for an answer.

I've done a serious study of this and it may surprise you that TODAY'S largest opponent of Bilingual Education is the 70's largest Supporter!!      He was smart enough to CHANGE HIS MIND after seeing the MOUNTAIN of evidence.      The IDEA is that non-English speaking kids LEARN "schoolwork" while at the same time, LEARN "English".    AT SOME POINT in time, the 2 converge and the "foreign" kids are at an equal point as English-speaking students.    IT DOESN'T WORK    Kids who are taught in Spanish, REMAIN in Spanish-speaking lifestyles, some for their entire lives.     Bilingual teachers are also some of the least-qualified teachers, and therefore offer a LESSER quality education than their English-speaking counterparts.    There is MUCH more on this (too much to put on Y/A), but the position you hold is TERRIBLY FLAWED.       Please rethink your position.|`|oLDeOuIWaa	NOPE, if you can't speak english, we don't want you|`|DY9NOh4taa	Definitely not, if children want to learn a foreign language they can do so in high school, where there are several choices available for them to choose from.  When our ancestors came through Ellis Island they had no choice but to learn English, the official language of the United States, and it didn't matter what part of the world that they were from, if they wanted to survive and prosper they had to learn English or there family wouldn't get ahead.  It is bad enough that when you call some locations or a business they say press 2 for English, why should English be treated like a second language, it is the official language of the United States and has been since the Revolutionary War, when America separated their ties with England and France.  If I want to visit a country, I have to learn at the very least a small part of their language if I want to find a motel and a meal. So, why should it be different here, our ancestors learned the language, because they wanted to prosper and secure the American dream of the ability to live freely without oppression.  There is no way that the federal government should ever mandate that children are taught bilingual in school. Let the immigrants and those that snick across the borders to learn the language or go home.  There are plenty of programs that will teach a person the English language for a small fee, I say learn or leave.
XIZKNNuhaa	I will just post up the USASOCOM main ones. This info can be readily found on the web and in books. I hope this helps. Others posters might add more from their experiences.    US Navy  The United States Navy Sea, Air and Land (SEAL) forces are the elite Special Operations Forces of the U.S. Navy, employed in unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, Counter-Terrorism, and special reconnaissance operations.    Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewman ( or SWCC, pronounced "swick"). Special Operations is characterized by the use of small units with unique ability to conduct military actions that are beyond the capability of conventional military forces. SWCC units are superbly trained in all environments, and are the masters of maritime Special Operations.     US Army  The United States Army Special Forces also known by the nickname Green Berets or simply Special Forces (capitalized) is a Special Operations Force of the US Army trained for unconventional warfare and special operations.   Primary Missions  -Counter Terrorism - Special Forces are often deployed to preclude, preempt and resolve terrorist incidents abroad. They prevent, deter and respond to terrorist activities and train other nations' military in the basics of fighting terrorism.   -Direct Action - Direct Action missions are short duration strikes that are used when Special Forces want to seize, capture, recover or destroy enemy weapons and information or recover designated personnel or material. In many instances, Green Berets are in and out before the enemy has time to know what hit them. Many of these actions are quick-strike missions, usually involving a raid or ambush of an enemy camp.   -Foreign Internal Defense - When a nation needs to purge lawlessness or protect itself from rogue nations, Special Forces Foreign Internal Defense (FID) tactics are put to use. But FID campaigns are also employed during times of peace to help nations prepare for unwanted or unwarranted attacks by enemies. Green Berets organize, assist and train the military and national defense forces of foreign nations. Those governments can use the tactics to protect their citizens from aggressors.  -Special Reconnaissance - Oftentimes, before the U.S. Army makes a strategic strike against an adversary, Special Forces are sent behind enemy lines to run Special Reconnaissance (SR) missionscovert, fact-finding operations to uncover information about the enemy.    -Unconventional Warfare - Special Forces have long employed the use of Unconventional Warfare (UW), a.k.a. guerilla warfare, to train forces in enemy-held or controlled territory. Unlike Direct Action, which is generally a quick campaign, UW can last months, even years.     The 75th Ranger Regiment -also known as the United States Army Rangers is a special operations force of the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC); with headquarters in Fort Benning, Georgia. The Regiment is a flexible, highly-trained, and a rapidly deployable force with specialized skills that enables it to be employed against a variety of conventional and special operations targets.  The 75th specializes in airborne, air assault, light-infantry, direct action operations, conducting raids and ambushes, infiltration and exfiltration (by air, land, or sea), airfield seizures, recovery of personnel and special equipment, and support of general purpose forces (GPF) among others. Each Ranger Battalion can deploy anywhere in the world with 18 hours' notice.    The 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), commonly known as Delta within the US Army or as Delta Force by the general public and officially recognized by the Pentagon as the Combat Applications Group, is a Special Operations Force (SOF) and an element of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The force's main task is counter-terrorism, although it is extremely versatile. Delta Force is believed to conduct missions similar to those regularly attributed to the British Special Air Service (SAS), after which it was modeled.    The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (160th SOAR (A)) is a special operations force of the United States Army that provides helicopter aviation support to general purpose forces and Special Operations Forces. Its missions include attack, assault, and reconnaissance, and are usually conducted at night, at high speeds and low altitudes, on short notice, and in secret. The force is headquartered at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.    The 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) (4th PSYOP Group (A) or 4th POG) is based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, home of the United States Army Special Operations Command. The purpose of United States psychological operations (PSYOP) is to induce or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to U.S. objectives. In the United States Department of Defense, Psychological Operations units exist in the Army and Air Force. The United States Navy also plans and executes limited PSYOP missions.     USMC  The Marine Special Operations Advisor Group (MSOAG) provides tailored military combat-skills training and advisor support for identified foreign forces in order to enhance their tactical capabilities and to prepare the environment as directed by USSOCOM.    The 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion (1st MSOB) activated October 26, 2006 and is headquartered at Camp Pendleton, CA.  Like its East Coast counterpart, the 1st MSOB drew upon the ranks of Force Recon Marines to form Marine Special Operations Companies that deploy with MEUs and ESGs as a forward presence and maritime SOF capability to enhance the efforts of Theater Combatant Commanders in the Global War on Terrorism.    The 2d Marine Special Operations Battalion (2d MSOB) activated May 15, 2006 and is headquartered at Camp Lejeune, N.C.  Many of its Mari|`|Ojk7tMdxaa	The Air Force has Combat Controllers and Pareses.    Combat Controllers- "Aquire" and set up flightlines in remote and hostile areas. They set up communications, direct, and secure landing for inbound aircraft.    ParaResuce- Provide Search and Recovery and Medical Assistace to downed aircrew.      Both require Jumpschool Training.    The Air Force has numerous Operation Special Ops squadrons, for AC-130 gunships and discreet Cargo Drops.      The Air Force also has Special Ops Squadrons for very high level Intelligence Surveillance.|`|KLK4pKSFaa	well BTW u really should get ur info straight since u say ur uncle did all that..    Rangers-just  highly skilled infantry  and SFOD-D is still in use (or did ur superman uncle tell u otherwise)  and DEVGRU is a SEAL team buddy, its the new name for the former SEAL Team six, basically they are the elite counterterrorist SEAL unit.    if u join based off our info...then dont do it.  these guys that are on these teams knew what they wanted to do..read the book Lone Survivor the guy in there knew he was going to be a SEAL since he was 12.its wats in ur heart man not what we tell you.    P.S. u better start getting into shape now.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Ok here we go (I'm not covering all of them, just some).    Air Force:   Combat controllers, Pararescue. Pararescue guys are insane. I had an uncle who was one and then became a Ranger and he said Pararescue was just as hard if not harder.    Army:  Rangers, SF (Green Berets) Delta Force (not their actual name, just what they're known as. I heard they were disbanded however..).  Rangers do counter-terrorism stuff (like all special ops do). They are good at raids and taking out small targets.  SF (Green Berets) do the same sort of stuff just differently. I know one that said they're like the big brothers of the Rangers.  Delta Force did raids, kidnappings, rescues, that sort of thing (and all that secret stuff).    Navy:  SEALs, DEVGRU both are kinda the same. SEALs do the same job as Rangers, and DEVGRU is like a step up from SEALs.    Marines:  Force Recon, MARSOC, Scout/Snipers.  Force Recon does the same sort of stuff as SF and SEALs, MARSOC is MARine Special Operations Command.. so that explains itself. And Scout/Snipers well.. I'll let you take a guess at what they do.    My uncle (Pararescue, Ranger, Green Beret, and trained with SEALs and Force Recon) said that they can all do the same job, nobody is for real better than the other, although he said that the craziest of them all are the Scout/Snipers.    That isn't all of them, there's some Army stuff still (160th and a bunch of others that do special ops too) but that's a gist of it.  They for real aren't better than each other, and my uncle did say that almost every operation he was apart of had all of them in on it doing different jobs. Of course he couldn't go into particulars.. but still it seems they work together and don't have any competition at the special ops level.

If you don't know what law is being broken, why do you think it's illegal to name the names of people who owe them money?      Your question in general doesn't make much sense - if the debt is owed to the group, then the only people for whom this information has any value is the group.  If the group told me that you owed them money, how are you injured.  You owe them money - there's nothing I can get using that information.    "now threatening to expose them unless they pay what they owe."  There is no duty of confidentiality between debtor and creditor.    "But shouldn't they just take them to court instead?"  Civil courts are public - if there were some secrecy requirement, your suggestion forces the creditor to break it.  Also, since litigation can be expensive and slow, it's unfair to force the creditor to rely only on going to court.|`|qvl3PjdEaa	That would be considered blackmail. However since it is the internet there isn't all that much you could do. The only thing you could is contact facebook.    If these people randomly invited you and decided to do such a thing and you don't actually owe them money, again contact facebook or you can infact ring the police. Provided the person who started the group is based in your country.    EDIT: You didn't say if it were a bank or just a bunch of losers making crap up, but the only way they can announce your debt is if you willingly declare bankrupcy. (UK)    FX
PE6Gb8B6aa	Those stimulus checks are a scam.  Right now, there is no stimulus check to be provided to tax payers.  Right now....    But Obama doesn't seem to know what he's doing, so we may get one anyway....    For example, he is blaming Congress (the same term he was a member of) for causing the economic downfall while forgetting to put any blame on the war in Iraq...  Right now, Congress doesn't seem to want to give out any more stimulus payments b/c they seem to be under the impression if you give out stimulus checks, people will just save it or pay bills rather than spend it to stimulate the economy -- Congress wants any payments to appear over time as tax cuts, reasoning people with an extra $50 in their paycheck will spend money more (e.g., extra night at movies, extra night at restaurants, etc...) than someone getting one lump sum.  But Obama likes to go against Congress....    He also nominated 4 people for high power positions in the capital that Congress instructed him to investigate before nominating: Richardson (Commerce Sect'y), Killefer (WO perf. officer), Daschle (HHS), Geithner (Treasury).  Well, he didn't listen to Congress and now he has egg on his face.    He also wants the state dep.t to get $524 million to create 388 jobs that pay $30K a year.  Congress is trying to reduce those costs which is causing Obama to go on TV and, Rev. Sharpton style, fight to have his stimulus remain in-tact.    NOTE: During his 3 years as senator, Obama sponsored 272 bills and cosponsored 834.  16 became law.      COMPARE: In her 5 years, Hillary Clinton sponsored 635 bills, cosponsored 2441 bills. 54 have become law.    So you never know.  Obama might still do it just to piss off Congress.  Apparently he has magical powers that the 535 members of Congress don't so they ought to follow his lead as not only the head of executive power, but also apparently the head legislator of America despite a thing called the Constitution, separation of power and the checks and balances system.|`|3CSPfJu3aa	No.  There is no money in it for Joe six pack in this porkulus bill.

If you don't, then go to college and get your degree. You will have a few years to prove your self, and hopefully they will realize how committed you are.    If that is not enough for them, then you just need to know that it is your life, and you are entitled do what makes you happy.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	You have to go to seminary school and have your own civilian parish for 2 years before you can join the military as a chaplain. Otherwise, it's a great career. If that is your ultimate goal, and you have yet to go to college, you're looking at a long road, but a worthwhile one. My husband is a chaplain assistant in the Air Force. It's not anywhere near the same job, but he works with chaplains (obviously), and has considered becoming a chaplain as well. It's difficult to go from enlisted to chaplain though. You have to take that 2 year break in service to have your own parish (and going through seminary would probably be nearly impossible too while enlisted).   You should follow your heart. If you have a lot of determination, and are SURE that leading a congregation is what you want to do, then go for it. Otherwise, this choice is not for the faint of heart :o).

AA11644291	Change your majors my friend. Criminal Justice degrees are hardly accepted and a psychology degree isn't an accepted degree unless you plan on qualifying under their Diversified Program, which is even more limited in opportunities than criminal justice. The most sought after degrees are in computer science and foreign language, specifically Arabic, dialects of Chinese, and numerous others. Also, law degrees are a big plus, and advanced degrees, especially accounting, finance, and international relations.    Maintain decent grades as well, but I don't exactly think you are required to graduate summa *** laude. After graduation, you need to work for at least three years, probably longer. Usually new agents will start around their late 20s, or early 30s. Suggested work experience can be in law enforcement, your degree fields, intelligence, military, law, and a few others.    Stay away from all drugs, and closely limit your alcohol consumption. Stop downloading anything illegal, i.e. music, movies, and the like. Avoid any kind of illegal activities in order to prove your moral and ethical character.    Also, beginning a good physical fitness regiment and nutrition program is a great idea. The FBI will conduct physical tests to determine how well adapted you are to physical stresses.    Then, first you will apply online. If they like what they see in the application, you will be invited to take a battery of tests. If you are competitive enough, you will be offered a conditional letter of employment. A physical test will be administered following that.     Then, you will submit papers detailing your background so the Bureau can determine your character, morals, and ethics. The bureau will contact your past neighbors, former employers and colleagues, college professors, high school teachers, and several references that you list. They will check your credit and any debt you owe, your arrest record, your civil record, and your employment history. If you are married, your spouse will be checked for criminal matters as well as for citizenship. You will be checked for foreign allegiance, foreign interests (i.e. investments), sexual issues that may skew your judgement, and several other things. You will have to submit to a polygraph test as well, in order to determine your truthfulness.    If you make it this far, you will have to submit medical records and allow the FBI's physicians to test you for any conditions that could interfere with your duties as a Special Agent. The Chief Medical Officer will approve or disapprove you after that.    If you pass all of that, you will be offered a position as a Special Agent.    The best advice is to focus and work hard in order to make yourself the most ideal candidate for the job. You have to prove that they are better off hiring you. It's crucial you can convince them of it. An incredible amount of responsibility is put on FBI Special Agents, so it is a very competitive career to gain entry to.    You should also call your local FBI Regional Office and tell them you are interested in a career there, and if there is a recruitment agent in. They are nice and helpful people who can answer all your questions and give you sound advice.    (I was assuming you were referring to Special Agent positions, not civilian positions. You can find a lot of information on civilian jobs on FBI.com, through the "Apply for a job" link on the lower left side.)    Good luck.|`|2Hlctljgaa	Get good grades, keep your nose clean, and apply.  If they have an opening that you are qualified for, they will hire you.|`|cNnTgm7maa	They get boku applicants. I worked Law enforcement for ten years and this what I have heard through the grape vine. First thing is, due to the number of applicants they get they can be extremely choosey. Second just because they do list something as an official disquilifyer does not mean it won't keep you from getting hired.  0 Drug use. You will polygraph to this so don't bother lying. (and no you can't beat a polygraph unless you have extensive training in doing so, even then the results will not show you are telling the truth. It will show what is known as inconclusive)  I have also heard your grades ahve to be in the ball park of a 4.0. when you fill out your application, it has to be inpeccablly perfect or they will trash it.   Lastly the application process is like a year long. So I would get started early. Their website is pretty informative if I recall correctly, They also send representives to most big job fairs. So go down and talk to them. Dress formally!|`|HG5ih7Mgaa	try not to start by posting a question on yahoo answers|`|YDjoAKROaa	The FBI has a summer internship progrram.  Go to their website and find out when the application deadline is.  At this point, you'll have to wait for the internship for 2010 because the deadline is sometime in the Fall.  Anyway, if you can get into their internship program, it makes it much easier to get a job after graduation.  While you're in school, get good grades and stay out of any/all trouble.  Don't use any drugs or even try them.      If you don't get into the program, you will need 3 years of work experience after college before you're even eligible to apply.  For most people, applying this way takes 18 months to 2 years before they are hired.  If you get the internship, they waive the work experience requirement.    GOOD LUCK!|`|EMk4iBEOaa	You can go to there website under the careers section and they should have all the info.

XRYAfxpTaa	Sponsoring a sibling is 4th preference at USCIS and takes much longer than other family-based petitions, however you can file to petition her and she can file to adjust status (takes both when already in US). If he gets his green card and sponsors her, it would be a 2nd preference as a permanent resident sponsoring a spouse.     If your relatives are already in the United States and  entered legally, then they may be able to file an I-485  application to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident  at the same time as you file the I-130 relative petition.  Petitions filed at the same time with permanent residence  applications (I-485) must be filed at a location that is different  from where you would file an I-130 petition by itself. Please  read the instructions for the two addresses where concurrent  filings can be mailed.    http://www.uscis.gov/files/article/A1eng...    http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...

(frankfurt & munich and Berlin)    If no then do so NOW so they can get US passports.     since their father is NOT a german, the children are NOT entitled to german citizenship. German citizenship is ONLY passed down by blood, NOT by residency.    The sooner you get passports for your kids, the sooner you can get on a plane and fly home.     since you are not married to the father you cannot petition him to immigrate UNTIL you do get married.   USA rules do not recognize gay marriage or common-law relationships.  If you do plan to get married, then you can also apply for a fiance visa.    Otherwise he can apply for the USA visa lottery but that will not open until august or september.|`|AA11966821	You cannot sponsor your bf for a visa.  There is no such thing as a bf/gf visa.  Your children have no right to German citizenship since neither parent is a German citizen.  They have a right to citizenship in Bosnia-Herz. through their father -- he has register their births and obtain passports for them.    They may have rights to US citizenship through you if you were born in the US and lived in the US long enough, including living in the US after age 14.  So if, for example, your parents were not US citizens and took you back home after you were born, you might not be able to pass on citizenship, even if you have a right to US citizenship.  Did you register your children's births at the nearest US consulate when they were born?  Did you get them passports?  If not, you've got major problems.    To bring in your kids if they are not entitled to citizenship, you will have to petition for their immigration.  You will need to prove you have sufficient income and assets to support them and guarantee a $30,000 bond -- each.  You will need to produce your last 3 years of US income tax returns, proof of income and employment, financial statements from your bank, brokerage, and other investments, etc.    If you were married, you would have to prove you have sufficient income and assets to support your husband and guarantee the $30,000 bond as above.

Then they can be issued US passports as citizens.     As for your boyfriend, you can file for a K1 visa prior to marriage, but would have to marry within 90 days of entering the US. Or you can marry, then file a petition to sponsor him which would probably be the simplest way.

As stated earlier you need to file for a consular report of birth abroad for your children. NOW! Right now they have no real citizenship if you haven't. Germany does not give citizenship based on place of birth so they could not get a German passport and the US doesn't know about the children so no US passport.  You have a number of options:  1) check with the US embassy or consulate to see if you qualify for a direct consular filing. (you would have to get married)  2) file for a K-1 visa (affidavit of support might be a problem) and get married in the states  3) Get married there and file for a K-3 visa      1 might be best but not knowing all the facts...|`|6iI4xhFbaa	To stay in the United States on a more permanent basis (not a tourist visa or temporary permit) you can file for a fiance visa.  This can be done at the nearest US embassy or consulate.  From there you can bring him to the United States after approval and progress toward obtaining lawful permanent residency for him.    As long as you meet basic residency requirements in the United States, your children are automatically citizens but you must register their birth at the US embassy or consulate.  This is because a child born outside the US to at least one US citizen parent is automatically eligible for citizenship.  However, the US citizen parent must have lived in the United States continuously for a number of years within the preceding five years, or something like that.|`|1bb8d470f82f8d3bf45bc0813b126c7faa	if he hold a German passports he can come to the U.S. without needing a visa and stay here for 3 months.

If your boyfriend doesn't hold a german passport that is fine too and for a faster process it is better to seek help at the u.s. embassy there instead of coming here and starting the work here. either way he wont have any problems, he can in the worst scenario get an L visa which is a fiance visa and it could be valid for a long time.     bonne chance|`|I5mNvqGoaa	I think the fact that you have children together helps.  I don't know if you necessarily have to get married, but I think that also helps.  My mom married a man from England, and it took a long time for him to get a green card (like 6 months), but he was able to live here while they were waiting on immigrations.  I think you can both go to the USA as long as you all have passports, and then I'm pretty sure you can get everything else straightened out once you get here.  The kids will probably end up having dual citizenship.    The other guy might be right, you might want to get started at the US embassy there in case things take too long over here.   When you get to the US, they ask you a lot of questions in separate rooms to make sure you guys really know each other (like what is his favorite color etc).

You have already proven that you can't  be trusted or depended upon !    That OTH Discharge will haunt you  all of your adult life...it is like a police  Felony Record...never goes away...|`|TItRpckpaa	Yes it has a reinlistment code of I think JKK which is barred from ever re-enlisting, this is why they rarely give OTH's except for seriouse crimes because it really messes you up.    You can after a period of six months try to get an upgrade of your discharge, however with an OTH it is near impossible unles you can bring new evidence as to why you were given an OTH was not correct. The trial went wrong etc.   It basicly will not happen because to get an OTH at any type of special courtmarshial is a very lengthy process which involves them looking at the situation very carefully so i is unlikely that they missed something.
vFvI16P7aa	The answer for this can vary greatly from state to state, but child support non payment is a serious issue.  If she is not letting him see the child, that is no excuse for him not to pay child support, the child still has to eat and have a roof over his head!  He can take her to court and file that she must let him have his visitation (you don't mention if there is a custody agreement) or she can go to jail and pay fines, etc.  As soon as you are delinquent on child support payments, the prosecuting attorney's office can issue a warrant if they want to.  He'd go away for a very long time if he doesn't pay for those 18 years and he would STILL be responsible for paying back child support when he got out.  Oh, and by the way, it takes TWO to make a baby and decide not to use protection, so how could she possibly "USE" him to get a baby.  Maybe he can ask to sign away his parental rights so he doesn't pay child support and he'll never see his child again.  Sounds like he doesn't care anyway since he hasn't fought for his child.
9twZdl6laa	You have to go before a judge to terminate your parental rights.  But, be aware.  If you think that by terminating your rights, it releases you from having to pay child support, you are wrong!  Normally rights are terminated, when being with that person is detrimental to the child.  So, if you're just doing this to get out of child support, it won't work.  Don't be a deadbeat dad.  Support your children!|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Parental rights can be terminated for reasons of adoption of the child or substantiated abuse.  Parents cannot request termination of parental rights unless they are giving the child up for adoption, in most states.  When a parent abandons a child, they can be arrested, and are responsible for financial support and health insurance.  Children are not puppies that can be returned to the pound.
AA10118655	Sure you can demand it. They can also refuse to meet your demands. What is you plan if this happens?     Instead of demanding, just sit down with the manager and explain your concerns, and see if there is something he is will ing to do to compensate you for the extra work. Demands can lead to you being fired. And with the economy the way it is right now, I don't think you want to be rocking the boat too much.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	you can demand whatever you want but that doesnt mean they will give it to you.

Right now in this bad economy you should be thankful to have a job. My work has laid off over 150 people and I too have to take on more responsibility and hours due to this, and Im not paid by the hour. I haven't asked for a raise and because of that I still have my job. Always remember you are replacable. There are so many people looking for jobs now and you arent the only qualified person to do it. Work with the company and they will give you a raise when they can afford to. You will be more appreciated by the supervisor. If in 6 months they havent given you a raise then you should request one.

DY9NOh4taa	The best thing you could do at this point is to contact your attorney and explain to him the situation and get his advise on how to proceed.  There is no doubt that he will seek a hearing in which the Ex, will be required to attend and let the judge explain to him that if he doesn't start taking his responsibilities and orders of the Court, he may wind up in the county jail for contempt.  The attorney may also sens a letter to the Ex, explaining that if he doesn't start living up to his court ordered obligations that he may wind up back in court or in county jail.  The best thing to do is to contact the attorney and say nothing to the Ex, either the attorney or Clerk of Courts will contact the Ex, to advise him of the court date.|`|agpYSoobaa	GO ON JERRY SPRINGER|`|MIyMPgC4aa	contact a lawyer i think is your best bet|`|mz3EuHktaa	Don't know about the alimony thing but you should have taken your name off of all the possessions.

Tell them they must stop contacting you.  If they do after that, they can be sued.|`|7eWHGWYVaa	sure you can file a motion seeking an order of contempt of court.  Contact a local attorney for real help.  Also remember that just because the divorce says he pays, that does nothing about the creditors calling you.  If you were responsible for the original debt, then you still are.      Talk to your lawyer.|`|c773a6d9618f1549ce3fc0daab46330daa	He should have taken out new loans to get your name off of all debts. Yes he is in contempt unless there are no court orders. If he agreed to this in court and there you have records then drag his butt back to family court.    (added)  The best thing I did was get a divorce. She kept bouncing checks and not paying bills. Within a year after I got my divorce final my credit went up to the 700's. Keep at it and just pay your bills on time as you can and your credit will go up. My best advise is stay away from credit cards as they tend to get you into trouble.  Good luck and I am sure you will get it to work out fine. :-)|`|MS6IzOPLaa	Credit card companies don't care who was "awarded" the debt in a divorce- they just want their money.  If you were both responsible for the debt at one time, then you are both responsible for it now.  They will not remove your name, and court papers will not make a difference in this.  The same situation happened to us and we ended up having to make a settlement with the credit companies.  I would definitely go after him though if he owes alimony!
C7wjR42Daa	If the article says you have to be a CPL then that is what is needed.    The military is not like any civilian job. Just because you can do it in the civilian world does not mean you can do it in the military.

Presently the Corps needs shooters, drivers, divers, and translators the most. Court reporting skills are certainly something to mention in your fitness report (*are they called fitness reports for enlistedmen?). If you apply for that position, experience and certification will definitely put you a leg up above your competition. Keep in mind though, that if you are a man you are at a slight disadvantage when applying for jobs outside of combat arms.        If I am correct you do not earn a degree in court reporting, but a certificate. So no, the Marines will not reimburse you before, during, or after your study. The Corps does offer limited tuition reimbursement for active Marines seeking a four-year degree or a graduate-level degree(and some kind of thing for reservists too), but not for certificates and not until you are a Marine. I say limited because although they tell you its up to full tuition, its capped at $5K a year. The Marines do not have ROTC; they do take NROTC midshipmen. However, all NROTC midshipmen are expected to become Marine lieutenants or Navy ensigns. There is no reporter position for Marine officers.|`|d5a8e1d6c9cfa43700e10655d87c40deaa	For Sure...

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	It sounds like you are in school so I'll give an example using a classroom setting.    Let's say that you work really hard on this essay.  You do a lot of research and take the time to go over it again and again to get it "just right".  In your class, there will be other students who work on the essay just like you do.  Some students will put some effort into their essay but nowhere near as much as you do.  Others will only do enough to get by.  They have other interests and don't want to spend the time and effort on an essay.  A few don't bother writing anything except the title of the essay and their names.    In a week, your essays have been graded and are handed back.  The teacher has decided to give everyone a "C".  Granted, some people like you get a "C+" and the ones who only wrote down their names and a title only get a "C-".  If your teacher then told the class that's the way it would be from now on, how many people would strive to turn in excellent work and how many would be more likely to only do what is necessary to get by?    The fruits of your individual labor has been spread around for everyone.  The results of your labor are not yours but they belong to everyone.  Yes, the other students could have put forth the effort to do better but they chose not to make the extra effort to be successful.  Since you chose to put forth the extra effort, you should be forced to share your grade with others.  After all, your grade would have been higher than theirs.    Do you see why people who spend the money and time to go to college and work hard have a problem with others forcing them to share their fruits of their labor with others?  Many times, I've chosen to work overtime--60 hour a week instead of 40,  Under socialism, if I choose to do that, the government takes a much larger percent of my income away from me.  Just because I am earning more than a person who hasn't taken the time to go to college and who may only work 30 hours a week.    I have actually had a promotion once that I worked very hard for---and when I received my first check, my bring-home pay was LOWER than my previous pay.  The raise had put me into a higher tax bracket so the government was taking out more money every week.  I worked harder so the government penalized me by taking more away from me.|`|m6IZpNJLaa	If socialism is so great why didn't work in USSR.

They have enough pride, ability, and willingness to want to provide for *themselves*. There ARE people like that.  Many of them were our ancestors who came over here with nothing.    The people who think that the working class should support socialism are non-working class people who insist that everyone else should "help" the working class whether they want to be helped or not. These are people who want to feel morally superior to everyone else; that is their life quest. It doesn't matter to them whether such "help" stifles the incentive to work and fosters dependency - as long as liberals feel good about themselves, they don't care that their programs actually tend to KEEP people from prospering.|`|Q5NuDsgbaa	The fundamental problem with socialism, marxism, communism, etc. is that they all share a fundamental but erroneous premise: wealth is not created by people- it simply exists and the only issue is how to allocate it.  A great deal of our wealth and productivity IS created by the efforts, investment and ingenuity of people, and people generally require motivation to act.

When Jefferson was inaugurated as President in 1801, the Pasha of Tripoli 'Yussif Karamanli' demanded $225,000 tribute. When Jefferson refused, the Pasha declared war on the U.S., not by formal documentation, but by cutting down the flag outside the U.S. Consulate in Tripoli.    Jefferson responded by sending navy frigates to defend American interests in the Mediterranean, and informed Congress. Although Congress never voted on a formal declaration of war, they authorized the President to instruct the commanders of armed vessels of the United States to seize all vessels and goods of the Pasha of Tripoli "and also to cause to be done all such other acts of precaution or hostility as the state of war will justify."|`|BsQcplTQaa	Congress at the time was aware that sweet reasoning with Muslim terrorists would only result in American deaths.

AA11209233	Depends on what you believe.  There is no proof of anything in economics unless you jump out of the real world and make a model with unreal assumptions--in the real world you observe facts and then try to explain how it happened.    The New Deal had us on the road to recovery before WWII, but it took WWII to end the depression.  I'd say the New Deal worked--that even without WWII we would have had a booming economy by 1945.  Others say it didn't, that WWII saved the economy.  I've even heard an argument that the New Deal made the depression last longer, and that we would have been out of it before WWII if taxes weren't so high.      It's hard to prove that trickle-up or trickle-down is a better policy.  Increasing sales helps companies.  So does cutting costs.  Whether it helps more to raise costs and raise sales or to lower costs and lower sales is anybody's guess, and probably depends on how much change you make to each.    I was going to try to find you some evidence, but it looked like I'd have to do a mini research project to do it--it isn't easy to find what I was looking for.

q4EXFhV7aa	I don't think she should be barred from having children, but I also believe that part of being a parent is taking some responsibility for that child financially. What I will say is that we have FAR too many children in foster care in this country...awaiting homes. If your friend wants to be a parent, she should seek to adopt through foster care. There are 3 million children in foster care. It is free to adopt through foster care, and the children range from 0-18, all races, sexes, and abilities.   Further, the state will provide that child with basic necessities such as food stamps/WIC and Medicaid until the child is 18 years old. SOME states even provide a 4 year degree for all foster children in their state. My point is no, she shouldn't be barred, but bringing more children into this world and into poverty isn't a great idea.....when there are already so many children who are already in need of a good home.        EDIT: Lisa, I know for a FACT that they would absolutely be accepted. As long as they can show that they are able to care for a child, they would have no problems.|`|2Hlctljgaa	life isn't always fair.  She is doing what God intended her to do.  She should be grateful.  Why should I pay for her?|`|8SFoQvVLaa	Yes.  Poor people should have children.  Most poor people carry their own weight as best they can.  Your rant is silly.    Of course its irresponsible to have tons of children if you can't afford to care for them.  People do irresponsible things all the time.|`|59iSPST0aa	many people who are poor, didn't choose that kind of life, we don't know what their circumstances were. Just because they are poor, doesn't means they shouldn't have children. A lot of poor people have more morals than rich people. Just turn on your t.v. everyday, and see what our role models are doing to the U.S. It is disgusting.|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	Wow, that's all we need more wards of the state, I say if you can't pay for it, don't get it !     This may sound like a cruel answer, but the truth is with welfare reform she would not be able to get help after 5 years of assistance.     Now this would pose great hardship on a person who is caring for a paraplegic and the care of a child also.     What will she do to take care of this child after she had used up all of her assistance time ?     Will she be able to afford health-care for this child, along with all the other things kids need ?|`|D5A9JUDMaa	People who bring children into the world MUST be those who are responsible for them.    If THEY choose to bring kids into a POOR world.....  then who am I (or are you) to suggest that I have some obligation to NOT allow them to live "poorly"?|`|VSmQWuhEaa	She has a right to have children if she is physically able. I don't think we should restrict this based on economic condition, nor do I believe that we should have to support her children pay for their medical or pay for her to have them either.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	If you're not able to financially take care of your children, you shouldn't have any.......|`|x24ERLPSaa	If you cannot afford to feed your own child or to offer him/her a decent enough life, it's best not to act irresponsibly by having one.  Cruel punishment? Let's not exaggerate! Get a dog!|`|H9k65Ve0aa	Yes, foster care is a very good idea. She can even get a very young child too. Excellent idea to the one who first said it.    I have a friend who's Mom is a foster Mom, no husband, so she would still be able to be a foster Mom, and the extra income will be for the better to her and her husband. And they will not determine how much they will give them because of their income, it is what it is because of the child, food stamps, insurance and money.|`|LFYr9iH0aa	Many people have made it to the top from poor backgrounds.    Having a child is also a financial responsibility. I gladly receive Child Benefit but I fully understand from the start that I must afford to bring my children up at my own cost.    Her call.|`|eHjk9di0aa	I agree that she should be "allowed" to have children ... but I don't believe we should support fertility treatments that are already being over used as it is (unmarried woman with 6 children pregnant with 8 babies due to fertility treatments in california)     If she is infertile then perhaps that is what God intended.    I personally think that there needs to be limits set on this regardless of how much money you have, there is no reason in this day and age for anyone to have lots of children.|`|lcS4OmZxaa	You sound like a kind person.  But you aren't thinking this through.  Why should I pay for her mistakes, wants, and desires?  She doesn't need a kid.  The earth is overpopulated already.  Why should we pay her for something she simply wants?  I want a new car.  I'd like a boat.  I don't need them, but I want them.  Why can't I go to a public agency and get public assistance to buy what I want?  It has nothing to do with being poor.  It has everything to do with being a self-sufficient American.  Being poor means making concessions in your life.  You can't have everything you want.  She and her husband are already benefiting by taking money from others to pay for their survival.  Now they want to get additional assistance for something they don't need.  Perhaps you can get their church, neighbors, or friends to contribute.  How much are you willing to give them?|`|XNFvoIGxaa	Poor battlers as we call them in Australia have a way of pulling through. Children are a breath of fresh air to some people and they get pleasure out of having them. Unfortunately they way the kids are today, its not so easy bringing them up. Once you had matchbox cars and cupie dolls. Now you need to get the latest game machine and put up with the increasing drug dependancies, the graffiti, the gangs, adhd or what ever you call it. Rich kids are more likely to commit crime to act out. On the other hand China has proven that siblingless kids can grow up more self centred. Kids should never be too far apart. If they can make it work, great, good luck too them...But the world of today isnt old school. The final word from me on this? Kids are resilient.|`|bmsq005uaa	if poor people do not have children, who will cook and clean for the spoiled brats of the rich people?|`|s6b3RnsWaa	Okay I'm going to say something and I know some people won't agree but it makes sense to me.    Her husband has a disability, hes not dead so why didn't she have a kid years ago? Money? A woman who truly wants a child would not use such a lame excuse.   Anyway, she is now 35 and set in her ways........she would not more than likely make a good mother now.......sorry......I repeat.......she is set in HER ways.   If she really,really wants a child in the house, then she needs to look at fostering a child.......other than that, her situation isn't really a good situation to bring an infant into. Sorry for being so honest.........but if she wasn't with her husband I may of had a different answer for you.
xWSIIOpaaa	In Italy, mandatory military service has been put on hold since 2005, so your boyfriend can travel to his home country anytime he wants without any problems, as Italian men residing abroad didn't have to be drafted. Only if he settles in Italy and is younger than 35 he'll have to check with the local draft board. But even in this case it's very unlikely that he would be called up to serve.    However, if you two are planning to get married in Italy, he should check with the nearest Italian Embassy or Consulate (in Britain there are in London, Manchester and Edinburgh) in advance to get his paperwork done (he'll need to bring along his birth certificate legalized and translated into Italian, plus another paper stating that he is either single or divorced, and thus able to get married).|`|a66nvk0taa	He needs to check out with the Italian Embassy. He could still be on records for not doing national services there. This could be use against him getting permission to marry in Italy.

He will however continue to have his vacation time, just not at that specific time.|`|SdfDLsfLaa	yea what sucks is that he can actually fire you. umm. same thing happened to me, and its perfectly legal here in texas. but you might want to check into it in nevada|`|goHKCuyraa	Your boyfriend belong to a union?

zfueTHk2aa	A state soil is a soil that has special significance to a particular state. Each state in the United States has selected a state soil, twenty of which have been legislatively established.      Mississippi: Natchez.   Natchez soils are along the bluffs of the Mississippi Delta and are  throughout the full length of the state.  In 1988, the Professional Soil Classifiers Association of Mississippi  selected Natchez silt loam to represent the soil resources of the  state. Natchez soils occur on 171,559 acres in Mississippi.|`|59iSPST0aa	I am not sure what state soils means??|`|HcFHLGIaaa	sand?|`|abd8dd4fcfbbb00353f312ac986977fbaa	sorry if this is dumb...but what is "State Soil" exactly....?|`|goHKCuyraa	you talking like skid marks and stuff?
AA10206116	I don't expect it to be there. That's why I'm 23 and I already have a retirement fund going.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Of course it will stiull be there.    When they say, SS will be bankrupt,     It doesn't mean SS will have no money left.    It just means that if everything is kept the way it is today, then SS tax revenue, will not be enough to pay the current benefit levels to those who retire then.    So people would just get less SS.    But there are easy ways to extend the life of SS:    1.Increase the retirement age     When SS started, the retirement age was 62 yrs old, the average life span in the US was 55 years old.    Now the retirement age is just 65, but the average life span is 78 yrs old.    2. Increase the income level on which SS tax's must be paid.    Currently you only pay SS tax on the first $106,000 of income.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I know that as it stands, in ~2050, which is around when I am going to retire, that Social Security is projected to be bankrupt.|`|59iSPST0aa	It better!!!!!!! I have worked for a lot of years, and I want something in the end when I retire. Or maybe if all these CEO's stop with their millions of dollars in bonuses, there will be money for the hard working American.|`|AA10811674	Who says you are going to be able to retire?|`|AA10874247	In it's current form, no.

Obviously you better start planning now, otherwise it will be hard when you retire.    I don't plan to retire when i'm 65 though, i'll work well through and to 100. I don't really enjoy life when i'm not productive for long periods of time.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	I wish it would end now.  And whatever money they've been taking out every month would be in my paycheck so I can use it as I see fit.

WpxhXXKMaa	Basic Training has nothing to do with your MOS. Basic Training is the soldiering portion of Initial Entry Training i.e. weapons, fitness, obstacle courses, etc. Post for Basic Training are located at Fort Jackson, SC; Fort Benning, GA; Fort Leonard Wood, Mo; and Fort Sill, OK;    AIT for Chaplins Assistant is located at Fort Jackson, SC. To be a Chaplin you must be an Officer, so you will have to go to Officer Candidate School for that. I can't tell you if Basic Training is going to be hard or easy, it depends on the individual. When I went through Basic I enjoyed it, I was the Platoon Guide for my platoon. But, it's not for everyone!    I believe that the AIT for Chaplins Assistant is not hard...the schooling portion anyway! As far as promotions go, that totally depends on you. If you high-speed and a real go-getter than you should have no problem getting promoted fast. Otherwise, you will get promoted at the time prescribed by regulation unless you get in trouble and you are busted in rank or held up for promotion. Once again, it's all up to the individual|`|PG8iX61baa	I am actually leaving on March 10th for that MOS. You will go to Fort Jackson for 10 weeks and your AIT or Chaplain Assistant school will also be there for 6 more weeks right after.  Also, you need to have taken a writing class in school to be eligable for that mos.    Im not sure how easy it is to move up in the ranks, but I have 24 credits of college that moved me up to E-2 and then theres also a PT test that if you pass before leaving, you can get another rank up to E-3 before even going to basic training.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	Any and all MOS's go through the same basic training.  Their theory of a rifleman or soldier first still applies.  As for AIT and location, I'm not sure how they go about and where for training I've only met maybe 1 or 2 chaplains assistance in my career so far.  Your AIT shouldn't be to hard, I'm in administrations and mine was a breeze so I would say you should do fine.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Your Basic and AIT will be at Fort Jackson, South Carolina    You cannot be promoted to a Chaplin.    Chaplin's are Officers,     You need both a 4 year college degree and a Divinity Degree to be a Chaplin.|`|AA10709853	being a CA will NOT help you become a Chaplain.  you must have your Masters( at least) in Divinity, plus experience plus approval from your governing body before you can even apply.|`|TItRpckpaa	Chaplains rank up really quick, most of them on the battalion level are already majors. Not sure where their Basic or AIT is held.    Edit: Sorry didnt read the "assistant" part. No you will rank up slow as an assistant and it will not ever lead to you becoming a chaplain. You have to have a degree to become an officer which is what chaplains are.|`|7NfcM63waa	it shouldnt be very hard and the military need more chaps on the field

HpJ4wwC7aa	It's a highly litigious field so a lot of people have bad thoughts about them because they associate them with the negative memories they have of their particular situation. Lawyers have a lot of responsibility, and therefore people hold them highly accountable for every action they take. But lawyers are just human like everyone else. It's just when they do something wrong, it is considered even more atrocious, because they are held to a higher standard and should have known better. A lot of them also are in positions that give them more power than an average citizen, so sometimes a bad apple takes advantage of that position.<br>  <br>  But, in general, lawyers have to take more professional ethics classes, and pass more ethics tests, than any other profession other than maybe the medical profession. And most lawyers I know, and I know a lot, are very honest hardworking people who want to help people. Yea, they get paid for doing it, but its highly stressful, takes a lot of intelligence, and it is not for the faint of heart. <br>  <br>  Lawyers are the only profession that regularly work for free as part of tradition, and the high ethical standards of their profession. How many doctors do you know work for free? When someone is hurt and can't afford medical care, they will get treated at a hospital and the state will reimburse them. Not with lawyers. The state doesn't reimburse lawyers that work for free (pro bono). Pro bono is not a requirement, but almost, if not all, lawyers do at least 50 hrs of pro bono a year. <br>  <br>  I hope that shines a little positive light on the profession.|`|ucYwexwJaa	As with all professions, you will have your good ones and your bad ones.  Fortunately, I've had the opportunity to work with more "good ones" than "bad ones" though.|`|RjUhISEIaa	There's a joke that says...lawyers are buried 40' underground for deep down they're really nice guys.<br>  <br>  BUT...as the son of a deceased Federal judge I can tell you that I have met and gotten to know many wonderful attorneys. Additionally, I have also had the opportunity to work with many others who also are great and only a couple that could be described as unscrupulous. <br>  <br>  With that said it is my guess that the vast majority of them are wonderful people and the rest, well, they are the ones you hear of when bad news is arising.|`|RrmO1xkuaa	Why should I have anything against lawyers? I am pre-law myself and find the profession (esp. criminal law) fascinating. There are corrupt lawyers, just like corrupt doctors but for the most part I have great respect for their work.<br>  <br>  That said , here's a lawyers' joke: "Q: What's the difference between lawyers and vampires? A: Vampires work only at night." :)
6k6wofD2aa	I think that would be ideal but it's not gonna happen anytime soon.  That definition of a corporation differs from what this says...     "Corporation, noun. An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility." - Ambrose Bierce    Corporations have been turned into pseudo-individuals, so naturally, as most individuals want, they basically care for themselves foremost.     Good facts, ideas and alternatives by the way.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Whoever owns the company should decide how much they make.    We just should stop bailing them out.    If they win, they win. If they fail, they fail.    It's the free market you control freak.    A company does not exist to provide people with jobs. People do NOT have rights to a job. It's a contract between person A and company X to perform certain tasks and get compensated for it.    It's none of the Gobblements business, MARXIST FILTH!|`|8Mi15cTtaa	why don't we get our nose out of private businesses unless they get taxpayer money, which then makes it our business since technically we own part of the company.    If you think $100,000 is "comfortable" in most places you have no idea what you are talking about. $100,000 is low middle income in CA!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	There is no way I would take the risk of starting a business, do all the hard work involved to get it running, do the hard work to keep it solvent, obtain all of the skills needed, have all the stress from it, and get $100,000.  There are construction workers who make that.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	Why should "we" dictate the salary policies of any private company...?  I think it's ridiculous that wedding cakes cost $3K...does that mean "we" should get the government involved?|`|IUXriZQJaa	Fascism is where the Government dictates to companies what actions they will take and how much of what they will produce.    We are not a fascist country. Fascism did not build this country, Capitalism did. If you don't like what a company does, don't buy its products, but make sure you write to theor marketing department to explain why, or they will think it is just a failed marketing campaign (like the Chevy Nova in Mexico, where No Va means it doesn't go).        Here is an idea for you;    The average worker makes $7-10/hour.  Set the absolute maximum any CEO can receive as compensation of any kind at 100 times that of the averavge worker (not the average of paychecks, but the average pay of the largest group of their workers) in their company.    That is a reasonable thing to say, since attorneys can make about that much.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	For the simple fact,     A CEO's job is to increase profits for the owners of the company.    IE: The shareholders.    Company's are not there to create jobs, they are there to make the owners money.    Companies that do not make the owners money, go broke and out of business.    No one is gonna invest in a company that does not make them money.    You might as well put your money in your mattress.|`|sf7lOcIiaa	Why is the government involved AT ALL?|`|6AgnCKCPaa	No, I prefer to base all CEO compensation on what the owners or stockholders decide is appropriate..    You clearly have no idea what a corporation is.  It may be a publicly "traded" company or privately held but in eitehr case the owners are the shareholders not the public..|`|fjT0GoSqaa	CEO compensation is based on making money for the corporation, not creating jobs.

dJnRFpWWaa	I feel the same way about Obama's other Cabinet appointees, if he doesn't do his job effectively then he should be fired. This isn't the financial sector of the country where you can drive your company and the country into a ditch and still get a multimillion "performance" bonus. This is the public sector, and the public sector has the responsibility of picking up the pieces of this mess and devising an economic strategy for the future.    Ideology is an impediment to critical thinking. To the extent that a bipartisan Cabinet can stimulate pragmatic problem-solving among the political elite in Washington, D.C., that would be a good thing. I don't know that it will, but it would be a welcome outcome.    I look forward to hearing Senator Gregg articulate what he hopes to accomplish as Commerce Secretary, and how his performance should be evaluated during a sever recession.|`|U50orfPhaa	I think he only did that because his approval rating is falling so quickly.   Since his so called stimulus is full of PORK that the democrats have been trying to get for years- we ain't to pleased!  Plus the tax frauds he put into his cabinet- its his way of trying to shift away from that business.|`|6yQqtbiIaa	It's sickening. Obama nominates a phony Republican from a state with a Dem. governor who will no doubt appoint another Dem to fill the seat, thus giving the Dems a filibuster-proof majority in the senate (assuming Franken gets seated). That's not a coincidence, and it has nothing to do with "bipartisanship".  It is a VERY partisan move. Next thing you know he'll try to add 2 more justices to the Supreme Court, so that it will be in his pocket also.|`|8cd4e5f44ddf57a92d759bab9b6186d1aa	It's a hollow ploy. Obama just want's the appearance of a bipartisan spirit. The $ 819 billion dollar spending bill that recieved No republican support is an example.|`|A7qDWyTYaa	Very pleased with the bipartisan reach across the aisle. Obama has already extended his further to the other side that Bush did in 8 years, despite his line of bull about being a unifier.
PgFYPZg2aa	Yeah, that was gross on all levels, but saying what he said was as american as it gets, as much as I defended liberals blasting Bush I'll defend peoples right to blast Obama, albeit with retarded rhetoric.|`|a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	OK, now your saying stuff that is not factual. I've been listening to Rush for years and years. He did not say that he wants Obama to fail. If you'd pay attention, you would know by now that Obama has socialistic government policies & Obama's intentions are not the best for the country. Of course, any true, blue American would want these policies to fail!  It's not the man whom Rush wants to fail... it's his policies.    As to the other quote... I didn't hear that one, but what better way to say you think you've been had by the congress who is trying to pass the pork bill which only brings more debt and doesn't stimulate anything... the only thing Pelosi wanted to stimulate, was teenage sex.     Rush is an American citizen. He's not an elected official. He has the rights of an American citizen. Free speech has been a liberal mantra for decades. Now, when a conservative is using his liberties, you want to knock him down.     I would love to see entire towns get together for a group photo shop of bending over and grabbing their ankles... then sending their group photo to their senators. We the people need to speak up!|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	Rush does not want the USA to fail he wants Obama socialistic policies to fail.  If they don't fail you better be prepared to bend over and grab your ankles because you and all the rest of us will be getting royally screwed.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Of course he does, since he came out of the closet he has been doing it frequently. No its unamerican but you cant blame Limbaugh though he originally german (just think limburger cheese and arbeit macht frei)|`|f6OOxJQsaa	You will too once you get your tax bill.  BOHICA:  bend over here it comes again.    Obama will fail if he pushes his so called stimulus package.  It is anti progress.  Any economist will tell you that.|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	No.    He wants Obama's Socialist Agenda to fail.|`|DNaMIcomaa	The fat man cannot even see his ankles let alone grab them.|`|AA11593971	Actually, Limbaugh uses the phrase a lot when referring to how the Libs are constantly trying to "screw" America... and how they just expect the Right to accept it and "bend over and grab our ankles." A pretty accurate description of the situation in my mind.     As to the "wants Obama to fail" comment. I can't believe you still haven't heard the entire context of that phrase yet. You must only listen to MSNBC to have not yet got... "the rest of the story." Limbaugh said IF Obama continues to push his socialist agenda, he hopes he fails at that... because it's bad for America. On the other hand, he said that if Obama was indeed a Reagan Democrat... as he claims... he can support him.    So all in all, sounds pretty American to me.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	From what I have heard he does this quite frequently in the bahamas.    In saying that he hopes the President fails, Limbaugh is simultaneously saying two things. First, he hopes Obama fails to achieve the objectives that the President is pursuing on behalf of the American people. He hopes Obama will not start credit flowing. He hopes Obama will not reverse unemployment. He hopes Obama will not turn the stock market around. That's what failure would mean; that is what Limbaugh hopes for. Second, the suffering of the American people is an acceptable price for vindicating Rush Limbaugh as a seer of political truth. What else would we get by having the President fail?    To see this point, just ask yourself: If Obama succeeds, who will be made worse off? Not the homeowners who could now afford their mortgages. Not the drivers traveling renovated bridges or the rural residents who would now have Internet access over new broadband networks. Not workers who would see value returning to their retirement portfolios. Nope, the only ones who would suffer if President Obama succeeds are the "Limbaughs" -- those who have made a living pushing the ideological insanity that drove the Bush 43 Administration.|`|Ocyrox5baa	I don't know to your first question (gad what an image).  The second question has been answered a few times already.|`|jEYZkIrhaa	It looks like the left and right switched places.    Figures.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	If you liberals would only check out his website, you find out what he actually said.    Since he thinks Obama is a socialist, he wants Obama's socialist policies to fail.    For the last eight years we have been told by liberals that disagreement with the president is patriotic so Limbaugh's statement must be patriotic.|`|AA11409272	Call him and let him know you are interested...you'll never know if you don't try|`|yvPA8FSsaa	In case you do not understand what that means, it means we are getting screwed.  He wants Obama to fail in his attempt to expand the Federal Government.  He, I and a lot of other good people want Obama to fail just as much as most Liberal Democrats wanted George W. Bush to fail.      What is wrong with that?    *|`|2564ebc136b77a929f696fad679511c4aa	Rush can't do that. It's physically impossible for a man with a washing machine strapped to his waist to do what you described.|`|2aERh7hlaa	Actually what he said was he felt like they wanted him to bend over and grab his ankles and the Obama Fail quote has been taken out of context. Rush says alot of direct and controversial things and the media takes him out of context very often. If you want to know what he really say you should listen to him, He is very funny and informative at the same time. He also makes you think which is something that cannot be said about the main stream media.|`|GE9vpeZOaa	I bet Limbaugh WISHES he could bend over and grab his ankles...have you seen the guy?  And if he tried...he is probably so doped up he would fall over.    Well he is the voice of the republican party...exactly why they are the minority!|`|9hGKMt8jaa	I said that when Obama gave his election-night victory speech.  In about 6 months you'll realize I was right.|`|gRtmFa1maa	Rush has said this on more than one occasion and I only listen to him when I happen to be in the car when his show is on.    Rush isn't much into compromise. He feels his way is right..and that he shouldn't have to make concessions. probably why he is on the radio and not in politics.     Rush is first and foremost and radio entertainer. He knows his audience and he tells them what he wants to hear. Same as Ann Coulter, who goes on and on about the godless liberals and their lack of morals, yet commits adultery with a marrried man. I doubt either one of them truly believes everything they say. Do you really think these guys think GWB is great?  Of course not. They'll never say it though.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	I saw the interview and you must have ahearing aid problem..He didn't say either one of these ...    He said if Obama's welfare package passes--"Americans can bend over nad grab their ankles." Which I agree with.    AND--He said:' If obama's policies do what Rush and conservatives fear they will do--ruin our Country--then he hopes obama fails."    I agree there too. I hope obama's economic plans are thwarted because if they pass-we're sunk. I hope he fails in installing his welfare socialistic ideology!    Fail obama--45 million of us didn't want you to succeed anyway--we voted against you.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	This is america and Rush is right.   AMERICA HELD HOSTAGE DAY 13 OF 1460.!!! NOBAMA!!!|`|EPqnB7Epaa	No, he did not say that.  Some of you folks are so fascinated by a talk show host that you are losing focus on the real economic problems we face.  How sad that existence must be.|`|i6d582PFaa	I'd believe it. Rush Limbaugh is kind of like Alex Jones, except Rush doesn't know what's really going on.|`|bmCInR5qaa	Yes and his solution was to give people like him, he makes around $80 million a year, a bigger tax cut than the paltry 15% they already pay.
PaLJ4pU8aa	Good spot for the fella.  He and Jeremiah Wright and William Ayers and all the others can play pinochle together.|`|Jq5WK8caaa	I would have to say this, only if the negativity spreads beyond FOX news, then he will not only throw him under the bus, he will make a u-turn and run him over to insure the American public   <br>  The real question is, is when Obama will provide the most ethical and transparent administration in history???|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	if he does I hope that coward holder holds on to him so they both go under!<br>  <br>  feelin super...yeah the way you think its okay to control the way Micheal Steele and other good Americans think.....Hypocrite!  Scold yourself!|`|BpcgaJd4aa	No, why would he do that? Eric Holder is just relaying what Obama thinks about America. They're making it about race again so they can win 2012 re-election|`|pcXMERnVaa	yep|`|w3wqFTZCaa	old goat... if he does...and frankly i dont care....i only care about geting rid of all of them as soon as is possible.....disgraceful they all are......i hope he slips and falls under that same bus....as his brains squeez out of his ears...and he screams in agonoy....and thats the way it was....and thats the way i like it, uh huh...uh huh|`|6W7SuuCsaa	That would be 1/2 racist because Obama is 1/2 white.|`|ueKeUZ6oaa	You are Another white person who wants to control how blacks think. Those days are over so accept that fact.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	The media would... the media would through anyone under the bus to make Obama look good.
u9g2Cl6Eaa	It is quite simple, it is war.  People die.  The LTTE deliberately target civilians and have murdered opposition amongst the Tamil people who have spoken out against them as well as have been involved in extortion against ex-pats.  A separate state run by the LTTE would be a brutal dictatorship.    As for the government, you are right, they are also scum.  They murder civilians on both sides silencing dissent.    The world should work to force both sides to the peace table so that all civilians in Sri Lanka and live together in peace.  The island is too small to be broken into two countries.|`|f598d30e60d0a8ecbb5bd782a442def6aa	One word answer.. Guantanamo.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	look at their support for saudi arabia and their shocking human rights record. look at all the leaders the CIA has helped overthrow. the US doesnt give two shits about human rights or democracy. thats how they can support sri lanka. the tamils are only a terrorist organisation because the US says so. the tamils are a group of people who have been discriminated by government after government in sri lanka. i wonder why they want independence|`|rVqFTqCdaa	all you have to ask is how many governments has america still supported or failed to denounce or act against even after they found out that those governments were committing genocide?  turkey, germany, cambodia, iran, rwanda, ukraine  need i say more|`|Atwofojtaa	there is no other country is bothered about LT TE people except one state in India. only India has to fight for it ,but it is also not fighting for the human rights of Tamil people because it has lost it!s primeminister by the cause of them.|`|SlFlOK4zaa	The US has a history of supporting nasty regimes, brutes who keep the people down while American business steals all it can get its hands on, paying off a few Generals and leaving the people destitute.    The bastards are good at it too, and if you think a change of President will alter matters, think again, for he, like all the rest, will soon be kissing the business ****.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	I was in Sri Lanka a couple of years ago and armed, pro government militia were responsible for a lot of political murders of opponents.    It's only relatively recently that the LTTE have been classed as a terrorist organisation.    The US has a long history of supporting oppressive regimes. Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia... The list is a long one!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Don't worry.

A shining example of "objective journalism".|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Yup.  It's only a month and I almost feel sorry for Obama, even though I didn't vote for him.<br>  <br>  Then again, Obama volunteered to ruin my country by signing that ridiculous spending bill.<br>  <br>  And I don't recall any Democrats saying Bush was being unfairly criticized.
T3k7gjBmaa	First, Doc:  I think you mean "hook, line, and sTinker"....      Here's some food for thought:  The only time anyone has really had to work to "sell" me something was when it was something I really didn't need in the first place and I knew it would cause me financial angst down the road.  You think maybe that's the case with this so-called stimulus plan?!|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	Yes, it requires a total rewrite.  As for selling it to the American people,  they bought it (hook, line and sinker) when they elected this motley crew.|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	No, I think the Republicans should just let it happen (don't block it in the Senate, but don't vote for it).  Let's see what happens, there must be some reason that Obama wants Republican support so I say don't get anywhere near it and let him (and the Democrats) own it.  (He doesn't really need their votes in Senate, he just needs them to not block it).|`|R5f4MjZcaa	No, it needs to be voted down in the Senate.      If this makes it through, start campaigning to have those who voted for it taken out of office.    It is time to take our country back.  Thanks to President Obama, we see that it takes community organization to start a grass roots campagin that will fix the mess this two party system has created for us.|`|AA10124897	What you fail to realize, is the Democrats are bowing down to Obama, in their finest Monica pose.  Problem is, we are the ones who are going to be left with the mess to clean up...     Go ahead and smoke em if you got em... They are putting it to us this time... More like rape if you ask me...|`|fLQSULeDaa	Ag:         Not really, it will only takes a few more Republicans KICKED  out of office. After all, they already received their stimulus, but are looking for all the rest of the money. The pigs that they are.|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	Screw giving money to those that caused this problem because of their greed, the money should go to every taxpayer (no welfare people) to get the economy going.  CEO's are getting bonuses how did that help America?  If every taxpayer gets $50,000 to $100,000 this would stimulate the economy and we would not need almost one trillion dollars to do it.  Think about what you would do with that kind of money, pay of your house that would help the mortgage companies and banks, but a new car or pay off your car that helps the Auto industry and banks, pay off all your credit cards that helps out the banks, no matter what you do it will help the economy not to mention it will help the Taxpayers who will eventually have to pay the bill anyway.
N1gd7juqaa	When doesn't he lie !?!?! His whole life story is a lie.. He is the perfect politician (used car salesman).|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	He attempted to appeal to as many people as possible during the election. Nobody thought he could do everything he promised. He went to Canada today to tell them he didn't mean buy American.|`|AU70o6wTaa	the guy lies about everything, still says he was born in US when his grandmother says he was born in Kenya and she saw it. (maybe she's a liar too ).|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I don't know. <br>  <br>  Why did Obama say he would bring fiscal responsibility back to Washington and then sign the stimulus bill?<br>  <br>  Why did Obama say he would impose strict rules on lobbyists and then immediately break them?<br>  <br>  Why did Obama say he would usher in an age of new ethical responsibility then promptly start not only nominating tax cheats, but also defending them once their transgressions were exposed.<br>  <br>  Frankly my question is. Why given his track record so far does anyone expect Obama to live up to any promise or principle he has championed?|`|kzNnMrMHaa	I assume this is a rhetorical question since Obama has not fulfilled 90% of what he promised during his campaign. When are his supporters going to start calling him out on this garbage?|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Why did the Republicans propose NAFTA in the first place - Reagan & Bush Senior thought it was a wonderful idea.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	The guy has been in office barely a MONTH.  Its also ridiculous to complain about his not wanting to take this on in the midst of the economic meltdown.|`|AA10958272	And here, I thought I was the ONLY person who remembered this -- as the media, Obama and his many CNN minions, etc. yapped away about the Stimulus Bill and every one of them FAILED to mention overseas manufacturing & distribution? I'm still angry about how GWB, too, first bailed out the Big 3 automakers as USA industries, when OUR TAX MONEY went straight to Ottawa, Canada (where US cars are made!) and to GB and Brazil and the many arms, of these companies which are MULTI-NATIONAL, and yet OUR tax money lined their pockets?|`|FKDv6ycbaa	Has he ever told the truth about anything? are you surprised than?|`|vSRhp7zxaa	See the word "now" at the very end of the story from Yahoo!?  <br>  <br>  What does the word "now" mean to you?

Protecting and enforcing the laws of your country is not racist.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Define racist.......maybe you're too easily ticked off.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	Ignorance|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Because certain people just won't let it go.|`|0DdwMHieaa	Some people can be very selfish, and to hurt others by showing their hate .... and put them down for whatever reason does make them feel superior...

There are always going to be those people. And whether you want to admitt it or not every person I don't care who you are is predjudice in some way, shape, or form.|`|AA12374498	everyone's a little bit racist, even you.

ToztjpAsaa	Yes.  There is no place in a democracy for unelected, unaccountable politicians whose only claim to their privileged place is because of the dubious honours system, as a reward for long service in the House of Commons, on the whim of the PM, or because of their religion.    Many members of the House of Lords do a conscientious and worthwhile job, but many don't.  We need an elected second chamber to weed out the wasters, the time servers and the corrupt, and replace them with people who are fit to do the job.|`|SLTlvqRlaa	YES! There is no such thing as a Labour Lord. They are all Conservative, just placing in the policies that will get them more money.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	No just kick out the bad ones.|`|AA11018269	Naah. It's good to have that second stage to keep the Commons in check. But what the actual peers do should be much more transparent and accountable to a higher independent committee that wouldn't stand to gain from their decisions. I can't believe some are getting off with a slap on the wrist for massive crimes. The average Joe from a housing estate would probably go to prison for the same thing.|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	think we should get rid of it and also the Royals at the same time.    They are two anachronistic institutions in the 21st century.|`|dn4z7grYaa	Not abolished- demolished! and make sure all the loonies and doddering old fools are inside when the charges go off!|`|yb4FbFiSaa	No.  The purpose of the House of Lords and the Judiciary is to provide checks and balances to ensure there is no abuse of power by Parliament. The Government have become increasingly authoritarian, already decimating whole swathes of the foundation principles of English Law.  The Government listens to nobody; the reaction to the strikes shows this clearly.  We need the check on their power more than ever.    Before anyone bleats about unelected as opposed to elected houses, may I remind you that Gordon & Co. were not elected by a majority, and only got a mere 33 per cent in the last General Election.|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	The House of Frauds --- is an apt description if they do not clean their membership of Crooked characters & the Inherited Ticket to membership.|`|61YfPllfaa	the problem is that the lords and the commons are full of criminals. its as simple as that. and it has to be addressed. MPs and lords should not be allowed to wheal and deal with companies, do second and third jobs while taking taxpayers money. either they work for the people or they don't.....the whole system is an embezzlers paradise. how would it be if i turned up for a job in a factory. and told them to hire some one to cover for me because i have two more jobs. but demand full pay. with a guaranteed pension and i can give myself rises as and when i see fit?????|`|gYThMID8aa	Yes and the other lot! We need a system of government run by real honest people like me.|`|fea43ac2956bf41fab5f1df268f71f15aa	I used to think yes to this question. It is debatable about how you get a lordship and why you get one. But they do stop governments from dictating out right and the lords can vote against anything the government wants or at least block it for a while while they talk about the subject.    It would be better to just get rid of the sytems we are forced to live in and start again.

9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Good question!  There was a slight budget surplus in one or two years, the first since the late 60s.  But the overall national debt kept growing - because there were deficits other years, and because the interest keeps accruing.<br>  <br>  PS  The Clinton administration also "projected" urpluses out for several years after he left office, but these projections were extremely unrealistic.|`|LJYGchCqaa	Because the national debt has been ever increasing regardless of who is president.

Although by the end of his presidency, Clinton was encouraging the new government to pay off the national debt.|`|AU70o6wTaa	the 90's were good years, but it was all debt and the Dem's still say Clinton was a good President. the guy did absolutely nothing except chase women and destroy some aspirin factory and a camel or two.<br>  what a war hero.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	They dismantled the debt clock during the Clinton administration.

Now the Chinese government has relaxed the stranglehold on their own economy, and is making huge economic strides.    Who ever thought that we would see Chinese billionaires?    China is a great country, with a rich cultural history and they have only begun to redevelop their economic and social structure.    Personally, I think that a lot more shoes should be thrown at a lot more of the corrupt, inept and incompetent politicians, like the infamous Bush.    I applaud the courage of these individuals who show the disapproval of us all.|`|bibIAhN9aa	I think the interesting thing here is the reaction of the Chinese people. Ignorance and Extreme arrogance. China will never be a great country while its finest minds leave to live in the West. The stupidity of the communist party leaders is profound. It's gonna blow up in their face eventually.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	More to the point what would have happened if he had aimed straight|`|AA12050428	Seems to be the thing to do right now, he maybe wanted to get in the news and couldn't think of any other way.|`|AA12121752	A bit of an idiot really.|`|2564ebc136b77a929f696fad679511c4aa	I think this expands our understanding of other cultures.

Interesting, really.|`|A2M6sAklaa	believe it or not,i know the man who did it, his name is,HU FLUNG SHU, he did it in protest of a  chinese farmer who had sprayed horse manure over his property,police say they are looking for a man called,HU FLUNG DUNG.|`|wCCqsLIQaa	Who knew that the new international action for once oppressed free men is to throw shoes at men with power.|`|b409edba77e465cd9aa19f0aa2cda017aa	His shoes gave him bunions and as they were made in China he thought he would return them and save on the postage.

I believe that single-handedly GWB has destroyed the Republican party and created a climate where young people have lost faith in conservative ideals.  Suddenly, socialism is a solution to our problems because these new energetic voters where told that Bush was a conservative, therefore, conservatism must be something bad.  He was so far from being a conservative, and the few peanuts that he threw out for the Christian Right did not make him one.    He will go down as one of the worst of all time.  I couldn't even watch him speak to his boys in Texas when he got off the plane.|`|HJGgVvkvaa	They are both great Americans,41 and 43.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Very sweet, and even sweeter would be the words:    "Bush and Cheney indicted and convicted for crimes during their administration."|`|AA12191521	we've had a former president Bush for 16 years.

I may not have much affinity for it yet, but I'm willing to say "President Obama."  I'd think if I'm willing to swallow what I have to swallow to say that, the least you can do is just move forward with the rest of us.|`|MtweOtuLaa	They're certainly sweeter than "President Obama", which makes me want to vomit, by the way.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	Ahhh. Like the sound of angels singing!    Seriously--this should be a lesson to all of us. Neer again should we allow ourselves to be suckered into voting in a regime as un-American and corrupt as the Bush administration.  We have a serious situation to deal with because of our own failure to exercise good citizenship. And we are going to pay a ery high price in the next few years while we clean up the mess.    I'm not shifting the blame--it belongs squarely on the shoulders of Bush and his anti-American "neoconservatives" and religious right.    But it is still our duty as citizens to exercise better judgment in our choices of elected officialsthan we did.    Nevertheless--Thank God we are finally rid of that b**tard!|`|aVEVchFxaa	Sounding like  Tony The Tiger :  Itsssssssssss GREAT ! ! !

I wish George W. Bush the best of luck and success for the future.    I hope that in 2012, his brother John Ellis Bush (also known as Jeb Bush) will run for President of the United States of America against Barack Obama and wins, that way America can be blessed once again with another "President Bush." The Bush family is very respectable and play like Champions who always Win because They Play By The Rules.|`|JwPa7yxiaa	actually i am very sad about it and Bush was a great president. What is everyones problem with bush, i mean he did nothing to personally hurt you, and if he did i'd like to hear about it!!! anyway i am sad that obama was elected and bush is gone, but i'll pray for you Obama!

True, the words out of the priests are positive and supposed to be helping, but in the end, you can't find more intolerance anywhere than in church.

If marijuana was legal , It could be sold in packages of 20 joints (like cigarettes ) and cartons . It would be sold only in package stores to people over 21. It would be taxed (like cigarettes ), Which would make it a valuable commodity for the government. We would make huge amounts of tax revenue from marijuana .       As it stands we are losing money daily housing people we have made criminals for not following antiquated ignorant laws . Law enforcement wastes resources on a war on drugs which has been proven unwinable .       In the meantime the illegal drug trade gets bigger and bigger when it could easily be destroyed . There is no reason to buy drugs from a drug dealer when you can go to your corner package store and buy marijuana which has been processed by the government . This makes it clean and safer to use .      So if it was legal , there would be no more marijuana criminals in prison .The illegal market for marijuana would be gone . The drug would be safer . The government would make huge amounts of money on the taxes and save money by not using prison space for marijuana users . The police would be able to fight real crime and not waste  resources trying to clean up the marijuana problem which would no longer exist .  Since we are in a recession , this would ceate jobs for honest people in the marijuana industry .  Sorry I get carried away sometimes . lol.      No ,  I don't use marijuana ...

Bush started with nearly $400 Billion to his friends who were big CEO's before he left office, read the facts. They paid themselves first and Obama is trying to get that money back to fix our problems. The republicans are fighting the stimulus bill because they can not continue to pay these guys under the Obama administration.

(its what my uncle did) if everybody payed 15% of their yearly income. then there would be no need for complaining about rich people paying more in taxes then the rest of the world. it is a shame that two people in the obama cabenant had to duck out due to not paying taxes. i believe that they deserve prison time for spending taxes without paying them.|`|dVQdswtTaa	Wealthy Senators who don't pay in taxes more than most people earn in three years, ($128,000 in Daschle's case) are only guilty of "errors".|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	I wouldn't say that all Democrats don't pay taxes (I know a few misguided individuals who are hard-working people with good morals who have been suckered by the "party of the working man" rhetoric that the Dems spew).

DXXpHKupaa	When you answered my question yesterday, you hit it spot on.<br>  <br>  I knew everyone would just say "Yourself" or a similar answer.  This is the easy way. But people often don't think about what that truly means.<br>  <br>  They answered that and the majority of them went on to ask or answer some blatantly bias political topic.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to say you'll work together, but an entirely different creature to actually overcome yourself-your unnecessary hatred that is mirrored back at you.<br>  <br>  We must change our very system-we must shake it to it's core.<br>  <br>  This core is us, you and I and everyone we know.  But not just build on our own ideologies, but to fully understand opposing ideologies and see things from their perspectives.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, we become hateful, uncooperative shells of people.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter right now who set the house on fire, what matters is that we work together to put it out.<br>  <br>  Can we do this?  Can we overcome our hatred of each other and our loyalty toward the artifice of party?<br>  <br>  Can we be true patriots?<br>  <br>  Do we even know what a patriot is anymore?<br>  <br>  Well I'll tell you what I believe a patriot is.<br>  <br>  Perhaps I'm a little odd for the way I view our duty to our nation-<br>  <br>  The United States is OUR project, and the old notion of it being a "parent" and us being it's metaphorical "children" is a flawed notion that lures us into the trap of complacency.  The United States is not to take care of us, we are to take care of it.<br>  <br>  We elect officials and must hold them to set rules and guidelines.  Blind loyalty to a party is like ignoring the fact that the child is playing with matches because you are too afraid to scold him.<br>  <br>  WE are the parents of this nation.  We must treat it like a child we intend to raise right.  We must not be afraid to scold a child when the child deserves it right?  How much more so of a nation?<br>  <br>  There is no love in complacent apathy towards a child or a nation.  This is our project, our child-and we all have a part.<br>  <br>  The two party system is blatantly flawed and destined to continue stagnating.  Now is a time for action-the longer we stagnate the more drastic and regrettable that action will have to be.<br>  <br>  Acting now will alienate people for a time, of course, but like our parents always said "This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it'll hurt you."<br>  <br>  Better to accept that we must make our nation a little uncomfortable now with action then to assure it's demise in the future with inaction.<br>  <br>  So to me, a patriot is more of a loving parent-ever watchful and caring and not afraid to do what is necessary for the best interest of their child.<br>  <br>  That's just my take on it though, take it as you will.|`|535812a50f219760f8422e72a97882abaa	well I think your assumption that the republicans are conservatives is way off base. bot the big parties are far left liberal parties and have been for over 50 years.

There are too many laws and rules that can not nor should not be legislated. Morality if it is to be a virtue at all must be by choice.  What good life have I lived if the only reason I never smoked pot was that it was illegal?<br>  <br>  That being said I do think that laws do serve some general good. They give a frame work to the social contract. <br>  <br>  Where as it might not be bad thing if I as an individual lie an my taxes, if collectively we all do it there is significant general social harm.  The system we have allows for a Representative democracy to decide which things should be regulated be they left or right on the spectrum.<br>  <br>  All laws are based on some belief system (such as I believe contacts should be enforced) some we agree to more readily than others. What I believe the genius of the Constitution is the framework it provides for protections from the tyranny of the majority.  Our government is set up to be ineffective to zealots on the left and right. It is deliberately slow moving for the precise concerns you voice.  Hope that helps.|`|YupMCYHlaa	To me this has more to do with political parties than with political philosophies. I mean the Democratic Party is no longer liberal, and the Republican Party is no longer conservative.  Those are just labels these days.<br>  <br>  Both parties exaggerate their complaints about the other.  This is because the parties are really so similar.  Any two almost identical products in a free marketplace will spend all their time and energy trying to differentiate themselves from one another, and it's the same with the political parties, trying mostly to appear mainstream and to make the other party appear radical and extreme.<br>  <br>  Libertarians (big L) have the advantage of being able to believe BOTH parties.  They believe the malicious things Democrats say about Republicans and the hype Republicans lavish on Democrats.  <br>  <br>  But I think it would be better for us if we took -all- this rhetoric with a liberal (no pun intended) grain of salt.  REAL social liberals and social conservatives have almost no voice in our society. I can't remember when I've heard TRUE liberals or conservatives on the major media.  The discussion these days is almost 100% partisan, not philosophical.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Flawed logic and wrong assumptions. I would suggest to start from the begining and ask yourself - what is freedom ?

Remember abolition? A liberal idea that was eventually enacted by a liberal Republican president under pressure from socially conservative Democrats. Plenty of people disagreed with it at the time, but that was the law, and they had no ability to change it afterward. Then public opinion changed, and now slavery is considered an abomination under any circumstances. That may be an old example, but it's true. It no longer was a conservative or liberal issue, the issue was human rights.<br>  <br>  If by private world, you're referring to the private sector or business, well, sometimes they act in violation of the people. This is human nature. Sometimes the government has to stop it, but then again, they also can act in violation of the people. When both of them are in cahoots, it is usually disastrous for everyone but them.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	Libertarians are Libertarians because REAL politics is too hard.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that Ron Paul types are perpetual victim types that seem okay with being down-trodden.<br>  <br>  I suspect that they are afraid to get into the real political mix and prefer to support a hopeless cause to avoid the possibility of having to accept the responsibility that comes with being either right or wrong...victor or the defeated.<br>  <br>  Supporting Ron Paul is a way of "playing politics" by supporting ideology, but never having to deal with the nuts and bolts of policy.|`|mCbChkKraa	Both parties are unable to solve any of the future problems coming up actually.

1oxBCtmZaa	I don't support the Catholic Church either (I grew up Catholic, so I know better) but let's put things in perspective, shall we?     The Muslims invaded, and set up caliphates in, Spain, lower Italy and Asia Minor and parts of Eastern Europe.   The Crusades were launched in response to these incursions.      Two wrongs don't make a right but there WERE two wrongs.<br>  <br>  The Spanish Inquisition in particular was initially founded on sound logic.   The Spaniards, with the backing of the Church, had just won their country back from the Muslims after 700 years under Muslim rule.   Usually in that circumstance the foreign occupiers are killed or exiled.   The Spanish LET THEIR FORMER OCCUPIERS STAY as long as they agreed to convert to Catholicism.   They didn't have to convert, they were free to go back to Morocco if they so chose.    Many of them agreed to stay and convert.    But many of those who did secretly planned to re-take the country, and they tried to contact the Ottoman Muslims to obtain their support in launching a counter-attack to re-take Spain.   The Ottomans had their hands full and said no thanks.   But the Spanish found out about it and decided to hold tribunals to get to the bottom of the treason.   The tribunals spiraled way out of hand and became the torture-circus we now remember with horror.    But the initial idea was completely legitimate.|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	Because they are conservative to reactionary.

It was a very just system where wealth was distributed and in fact the system was the first ever place on earth where the welfare state was established. Unfortunately corrupt monarchies and dicators and idiots now rule. The system was adopted by many christians and jews.

oBL3AtRfaa	Travis, I hear you. There is a lot of fault in the private sector.     But the truth was a casualty of the war to elect Obama.     I don't know what would be a better system, but I am growing increasingly attracted to Libertarianism, which seems to be closer to what Republicanism used to be. My only concern is getting enough like-minded citizens on the same page about limiting government involvement in our lives to divert this country from its current path toward totalitarianism.  A third party can be a spoiler.

Bush paid far too much attention to looking for a man that you can pay a couple of guys in Jersey City to find much faster.    Not only did the war effect the economy but Madoff did as well, and the sad thing is that there was a guy who pretty much gift wrapped the entire Madoff scandal and handed it to the government who didn't pay attention to it.

If we can get good, honest auditors to document the inefficiencies and downright theft which has been going on, then perhaps we can actually do some good by passing the stimulus bill.    Only problem is:  it is probably just as difficult to find an honest auditor in Washington as it is to find an honest lawyer or lobbyist!    And I agree 100% that Bush was not the reason why our economy has tanked.  Ever since 1970, our government has tried to answer the demands for a 'free market' and deregulation, but we only created a system which made it possible for rich people to get even richer by collecting taxpayers' money to line their own pockets.  We need a fair market, not a free market.    And yes, we do need a whole government make-over.  But I don't know how we are going to do it - the lobbyists are going to control the government no matter what the president says or does to stop it.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	People who have brains realize it WAS the Republicans -- who've run the country for most of the last 28 years.    Republicans are the ones who wanted deregulation, allowing the rich to steal everyone else's money. They didn't want anyone looking into the packaging and sale of bad debt -- which enriched a few, at everyone else's expense.    It's not just lack of credit, but the whole Republican agenda of concentrating most wealth in the hands of a few -- leaving less and less for the vast majority of us, and ultimately destroying the middle class. (Every year, more and more people are poorer and poorer than they were the previous year, in terms of buying power -- which is why so many businesses are going under, leading ot more unemployment, and more poverty.)    What we really need is an even bigger stimulus package -- buying stuff, to keep suppliers in business; hiring people, to lower unemployment and give people money to spend; improving infrastructure, to save huge piles of money in the long term.    Well, no, the president can't single-handedly set the budget or pass laws. That's why we need to pressure the Republicans to stop preventing our recovery.

We are NOT about to go through a Great Depression.  No one bought HD big screen TV's in the Great Depression and unemployment was high.

He IS the President but he is not infallible.  The so-called stimulus package that he is proposing will not do exactly what it is intended to do.

Bad news, to fix all of our infrastructure problems, it would cost approximately 2.2 trillion dollars.|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	I see at the bottom of your referenced article there is mention of Free Trade but that comes after the Mortgage issue.  To use your logic does that mean he wants houses moved to the Interstate routes?    The Interstate system was designed in the 50's and needs lots of attention especially bridges that were built before reasonable standards were established.      One good thing about Obama is he makes his intent very clear and invites any question involving intent or substance.  Did you post your question on his site?  I wouldn't think so.....  You probably haven't even take the time to find out how.  I did when I had what I thought was a reasonable question and got a real answer.      Feels so much better than YA answers because all you get here is people who agree with you because they also don't take the time to be relevant.  One thing he has said, you can complain but please do something positive to change things.  And you have......... done,,,,,,,,????    Look at your reference to the worlds largest trade flow.  Where's the documentation.  Just because some idiot says it where you can find it does not mean it's true.  DUH........  There is no North Trade Flow that can match cross Pacific Trade.

e80d865060201c6543892c88a41bba3caa	You must be covered by a valid TV Licence if you watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV. It makes no difference what equipment you use - whether its a laptop, PC, mobile phone, digital box, DVD recorder or a TV set - you still need a licence.    You do not need a TV Licence to view video clips on the internet, as long as what you are viewing is not being shown on TV at the same time as you are viewing it.    If you use a digital box with a hi-fi system, or another device that can only be used to produce sounds and can't display TV programmes, and you don't install or use any other TV receiving equipment, you don't need a TV Licence.          If you have none of the above and they are harassing you then write to your MP.  If they come around then tell them to go away and get a warrant.    I must admit, I take great delight in annoying the officious little Bug@@@@.|`|nW3iJkT5aa	If you have no TV .Tell them to go to hell  Much as the govt would like  This NOT yet a police state  It makes my blood boil when little hitlers demand this an that  My own case is slightly different from yours insofar that I do have a TV in the house which I don't use  I am against licence fee being used for the promotion of filth like Jonathon Ross & the huge salaries of presenters & managers  As a result I am conducting a one man protest by refusing to pay the fee & prepared to be gaoled if necessary  I could of course throw the TV out but why should I  Its my furniture that I paid for & NOBODY is going to tell me what to do with it  I am hoping that they will try & take it from me, They will have a fight on their hands  Most people are quite happy with the licence fee & what they get just as I used to &  Iv`e got no argument with that  When I am ordered to pay for something that I dont want, Then thats a different story|`|R534McNOaa	The T/V Licensing come under H.M Customs & Excise body of Government Office, who have more power than the Police, with the "Right" to search household premises without a Warrant, these days, in the UK, a T/V license is also required for Personal COMPUTER (PC/Laptop) as T/V companies as the BBC also transmit their programs on their Web Pages, so even though you don't have the conventional T/V you have a PC and therefor WILL require a License ....

Are there enough prisons to put us all in at once? NO, the back log of people waiting to go to court would be a nightmare and as a final thing they would have to prove who owned the TV in the first place and if you went to prison then the person in the house would be the new owner and the whole thing starts again.

4l0LIbl6aa	I don't hate her, and for the most part unless you've sat down and had a beer/cup of tea and a chat with her then it's difficult to judge her as a person. That's the same for the other candidates and for people in the world in general.     But as would be the case if you were hiring someone for a job, while you may not know them as a person, you can get a good inclination as to their knowledge, intelligence and ability to do a job. And unfortunately this is where Mrs Palin lets herself down as she has indicated that she is not knowledgeable enough about the things that really matter to be qualified to be a VP and potential President. This is not and should not be taken as an abuse to Reps, if she were a democrat I would say the same thing. I refuse to believe that she is the most qualified person the Republican party has to offer, there are some seriously intelligent and experienced Republicans out there, which begs the question why she was asked to be VP in the first place.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	WWJD?

That's fine, because of course that is your right but I think you should look at it from the overall view. Both sides are attacking each other, and they are being quite vicious about it. I also really hope that as you move further and further to the right, you are doing so because you identify with their platform and that they are the right candidate for you and not because you feel they are picking on someone.

Thus, we need a really big spending package, to buy stuff (keeping suppliers in business), and hire people (so they aren't unemployed, but have decent incomes) -- and do some productive stuff along the way, such as making government buildings energy-efficient, and preventing roads from disintegrating, which will save everyone piles of money down the line.    Who will lay off that many people? The idea is to STOP hemorrhaging jobs.    JUNK? Do you mean food and clothes? Do you mean things that manufacturers make, and others transport, and still others sell -- thereby earning their livings, and having income to pay taxes with?    You may want to see a 25% unemployment rate within a few years, but you're alone in that.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	Nothing good.  I think its amusing that the Right are so obsessed with Pelosi.

I know house prices were way to high.  The prices of homes should reflect the wages that americans make.  Before this last bubble, home prices were so high that you couldn't get much house for your buck. If banks, real estate agents, and appraisers wouldn't have kept jacking up the price of homes, they would have been affordable and less people would have defaulted on their loans.  Even so, that does not give people the right to get into a loan they can't afford and the government has no right to tax the rest of us for it.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	And the icing on the cake is ACORN has announced they are mounting another drive to make lending institutions make more bad loans to those that can't afford them and Obama's stimulus package has given ACORN 4 billion dollars to fuel their drive.|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	Welcome to Obamaland!!!|`|fPMVuB87aa	i feel like asking you, are you Warrior5062 from Dead Frontier?<br>  that avatar that you use looks awefully similar to his|`|AA10187742	I definitely hear you and feel the exact same way.

The high number of foreclosures is mostly why housing values are so low in the first place. If they weren't low, you can afford to sell your house or borrow against your home if need be.<br>  <br>  And nobody is dumping money on the fire here. All they they are doing is forcing banks to refinance mortgages for people who can't pay. And this will come out of all the money we already gave these banks in the first place.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you are obsessed with punishing people even if you get hurt in the process. The fact is, lots of people screwed up. Homeowners, banks and mortgage companies, Wall Street and government. Even though some people will get a second chance, the fact is that the days of loaning to people who can't afford it are over. <br>  <br>  The question you have to ask yourself, is do you want to punish people for past stupidity or do you want stop this recession from getting worse? I'll take the latter any day.|`|gau0w8LMaa	It was never designed to. I hear all these people who say your home value will go up. If you are making your payments and doing the right thing, your home value will go up anyway. Whether these people get bailed out or not  home prices will come back. Basically they are telling the responsible ones that they don't really matter as they must be one of those rich republicans.<br>  <br>  If judges are allowed to renegotiate principal the market will be flooded with foreclosures and we will be in worse trouble than we started out. Why would anyone sit on a devalued property and owe more that its worth while those who could  not make their payments get a better deal and will ultimately make a greater profit from it.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	The funny thing is that when I was in the buying market, I was offered a loan of 180K.

But yes the bottom line is that if you do not bail out your neighbor you stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars due to the property value of your home declining. This would lead to more people bailing from their properties because who in their right mind would pay off a $400,000 (plus interest )mortgage when the worth of the house is 150 grand or so and dropping? If you invest in raising the property values you will be rewarded handsomely if your property value goes back up.<br>  <br>  Also the dweeb has it wrong . If he borrowed 120,000 dollars with interest , over the life of the loan he is probably going to pay about 300,000 in total. Now if housing keeps sliding he will be paying 300,000 dollars for a house that is worth 80,000 if he is lucky. In this scenario his net worth is 0. He would be better off putting that money away every month in the bank or an investment  instead of throwing it down the drain every month.

Some people are good, honest, hard working Americans who are struggling to keep their house from going into foreclosure while they are pounding the pavement, to no avail, to find work.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I would also like to remind the republicans on here that this was McCain's plan all along.....to bail out homeowners in danger of being foreclosed on. It was one of his major talking points during the election process. You still voted for him. Now that Obama is taking steps to follow through on McCain's idea....all of a sudden you are all ticked off and disgusted? You guys crack me up.|`|HZy629kLaa	Quite simply, if your neighbors house forecloses, you lose money.  I knew it was bad with foreclosures but I saw on Nightline last night that in Phoenix houses that sold for $250,000 were now selling for $95,000 - $100,000.<br>  <br>  That is a hell of a hit to take not for the foreclosed people but for the people left behind.  Even if you can pay your mortgage and hold on, and many people can, if 2 or 3 of those is next to you your house isn't worth the $250,000 you paid for it when a realtor does comps, or the bank appraises.  So, even 5 years from now you have the most expensive house on the block and a really hard time making a sale.<br>  <br>  Get it?|`|AA10251268	While I don't know your specific situation or the specifics of his plan, Obama has stated that only responsible homeowners would get relief.

As lo anuncia la prensa extranjera y as lo afirm Cayo Calgula AMLO en entrevista radiofnica. Al or esto, millones de mexicanos dijeron al unsono: ?rale!; yo a?ado que ya podra haberlo anunciado antes del 2 de julio y nos hubiramos ahorrado las elecciones, el trabajo de un milln de mexicanos, la participacin de cuarenta y dos millones de votantes, los edulcorados discursos de Pericles Adams Ugalde y los enojosos trmites post-electorales que han creado un santo enredijo del cual ya no vemos cmo salir.      Tan sencillo que hubiera sido que AMLO se arreglase muy bien, se dirigiera al TRIFE y, ante el Tribunal, anunciara: Oigan, jueces, la mayora ya me dijo que yo soy el Presidente; ?dnde paso a recoger mi banda y a dnde mando por la silla?. Con estos sencillos pasos, Mxico sera ahora un pas terso, tranquilito y contento de tener un Presidente comprobadamente legtimo y nada espurio. Estaramos en la pura verbena popular. En verdad no entiendo por qu AMLO se tard tanto en decirnos lo que siempre ha sabido, lo que es su destino manifiesto y lo que le susurra el Ni?ito Jess. Tampoco entiendo por qu no nos dio tiempo de disfrutar tan magnfica noticia. En cuanto termin de darla, cay sobre su ser el velo de la ira y se arranc con unas declaraciones que en Espa?a calificaran de acojonantes. AMLO avis que era muy probable que esta noticia de su asuncin a la Presidencia cayera en los fros y duros corazones de los hombres de poca fe y menos madre quienes seguramente no lo aceptaran como el nuevo Mesas (exigirn un recuento neurona por neurona) y as, en el triste y molesto caso de que la gleba azul se pusiera chirrisca, l procedera a tomar carreteras y aeropuertos y muy probablemente enviara a su grupo de choque femenil a que clausurara simblicamente Wall Street y el Capitolio que les queda de camino.      Han de perdonar ustedes (Ma. De la Paz y Fernando), pero estas locuras y estas pblicas invitaciones a la subversin ya no caben en la bandera de "primero los pobres". Yo leyendo a Bretch aprend la nocin de "El hroe eficaz" y en el caso (clnico) que hoy nos ocupa no veo la eficacia de retar y amenazar frontalmente al Estado mexicano, a sus instituciones y a los millones de seres que todava creemos en las soluciones justas y pacficas. Burla burlando, lo que dijo Andrs Manuel constituye una declaracin de guerra. Supongo que al hacerla, AMLO, que ya aprendi la sabia leccin de los macheteros de Atenco, cuenta con la parlisis y la inaccin del Estado. Yo no estara tan seguro de eso, ni tampoco confiara tanto en que sean millones de discpulos los que le acompa?en a la hora de saltarse las trancas. Ni siquiera creo que los de su propio partido que tanto ganaron en estas elecciones se lleguen a adherir a las invitaciones de su candidato incmodo.|`|818bd32761d4c0208cbe57550f0b0d37aa	A que es un megalmano cretino, y que est mal de la cabeza.

La Educacin es uno de sus mejores logros, porque el email y la televisin ese es el nico medio por el que la gente bonita se informa(no vayan a leer periodicos y se den cuenta de otra realidad, que muchos que votaron por FECAL se enteren que son pobres, -en EEUU un pobre gana 15 mil dlares anuales promedio-, mejor as la dejamos, recordemos televisa siempre nos dir la verdad).

Souvent les fran?ais manquent de culture, ils sont gnreux mais n'ont pas conscience des ralits de certains populations! Vous en voulez des preuves :- "La France deviendra dans moins de 20 ans la colonie de ses anciennes colonies" (Vladimir Poutine, agence TASS en sept 1995)- "L'immigration est aussi un facteur de guerre civile, en l'absence de communaut ethnique tant que les citoyens n'en sont pas arrivs  respirer d'un mme souffle"...."

Mais comme nous sommes dans un pays libre, j'ai le droit de porter une arme. Et de flinguer ceux qui br?lent mon drapeau" (Johnny Cash)- " Un conciliateur c'est quelqu'un qui nourrit un crocodile en esprant qu'il sera le dernier  tre mang" Winston Churchill)- "Dans 20 ans, c'est s?r, la France sera une rpublique islamique" (Hussein Moussawi, chef du hezbollah 10/1988)- " Nous pensons tablir une rpublique islamiqe en France, o nous avons plus d e4 millions de musulmans" (Cheik Mahommed Fadlallah- guide spirituel du hezbollah, propos rapports par l'Associated Press 31.01.1990)Il y en a ainsi encore beaucoup de la mme veine!

Je pense notamment aux arbres. Bientot l'Afrique sera entierement defrichee. Les pays developpes ont tous des programmes de protection des forets: en France le parc forestier couvre 28% du territoire, au Japon 80%. Les forets sont necessaires pour un tas de raison, la plus importante etant d'empecher l'erosion du sol sur les surfaces agricoles.    Or les pays developpes refusent de reduire leur consommation de papier et de bois de construction. Le Japon surtout est responsable d'un tiers de la deforestation dans le monde. Donc il faut importer le bois de pays plus pauvres. Facile lorsqu'ils ont des bureaucrates corrompus comme au Cameroon ou en Indonesie, qui vendent des forets a des multinationales pour quelques bouchees de pain. Donc ce n'est pas uniquement la faute des multinationales occidentales, c'est aussi a cause de bureaucrates corrompus dans les pays en voie de developpement.    Mais les faits sont la, les pays du tiers monde auront pour beaucoup un environnement completement devaste d'ici 3 decennies. La deforestation est la cause majeure de la desertification en Afrique. Des centaines de millions de personnes seront ainsi deplacees.

Primo, quand tu parles d'indpendance, on suppose que tu parles de la fin de la colonisation. Je te dirais que ta question n'a pas lieu d'tre parce que la colonisation n'est pas termine. Malgr ton manque de culture apparente sur l'Afrique, je crois que tu as entendu parler de la NEO-COLONISATION.    --> Renseigne-toi sur ce site pour comprendre le pourquoi de la colonisation : http://temps.site.voila.fr/colonisation.... tu verras que les causes ont t :  - conomiques (bien sur)  - dmographiques (occuper les troupes militaire entre les guerres, contenir l'augmentation de la population entre 1870 et 1914)  - imprialistes (rivalits entre nations europennes)  - civilisatrices (ca te rappelle les idologies du djihad et des croisades ca non?)    Crois-tu que ces raisons soient compltement obsoltes? La dcolonisation en Afrique occidentale et du nord avait t prvue pour les annes 2010 et pas avant. Elle a t anticipe d'une 50aine d'annes et les europens ne se sont pas retirs sans s'tre assurs de la signature de pactes conomiques. Crois-tu vraiment que ces Africains qui pendant des dcennies ont subi la loi de la France, ont pu du jour au lendemain les faire partir sans faire de concessions?  Ces pactes avaient pour objectif non plus la mainmise territoriale sur les pays coloniss mais conomique et morale seulement. D'ou le terme no-colonisation. Hubert Vdrine ancien ministre fran?ais des affaires trangres dvoilait il n'y a pas longtemps les intentions de la France pour l'Afrique dans ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler ? Colonisation new-look ? en affirmant, je cite "Il faudrait actualiser, rendre lgitimes les formes modernes de protection ou de tutelle sous mandat du conseil de scurit rform": http://membres.lycos.fr/dieudosoutien/ar...     La colonisation n'est pas termine, elle a juste pris un autre visage, donc l'indpendance dont tu parles est inexistante.     2. Quand tu parles du pillage des richesses, lis ceci : http://www.africamaat.com/article.php3?i...  Tu y constateras que les multinationales europennes qui exploitent notre ptrole (TOTAL), notre bois (Rougier), ne participent pas au dveloppement de lAfrique Noire, elles entretiennent par contre une collusion trs marque avec les pouvoirs politiques en France et en Afrique Noire, pour les besoins dun type de dveloppement au profit de la France. Comment ne veux-tu donc pas que les prix soient les plus bas? En effet, les activits des multinationales en Afrique Noire ne sont ni un fait du hasard, ni une ncessit pour les conomies africaines. Elles rsultent de lessence intrinsque des fausses indpendances des annes 60. N'oublions pas que lors des indpendances, des restrictions et interdiction sont faites par la France  ses ? anciennes colonies ?, non seulement de transformer leurs matires premires, mais galement dutiliser dautres moyens pour leur vacuation, que les services maritimes ou ariens de la ? mtropole ? ; ce qui, de fait, installe un goulot dtranglement qui empche lAfrique Noire dite francophone de satteler aux taches de son dveloppement.  Avec ca tu vas me dire que les occidentaux paient pour nous alors que depuis des sicles, aprs la traite ngrire, aprs la colonisation et maintenant la no-colonisation nous travaillons pour l'Occident? Pour se redresser et parce que menotte financirement par l'Occident, l'Afrique, comble de l'ironie a contract des dettes vis--vis de celles-ci, dettes aujourd'hui encore prsentes et dont nous ne pouvons malheureusement que payer les intrts. Ne crois-tu pas que si nous avions eu le choix nous serions alls demander de l'aide aux pays arabes et musulmans qui eux n'appliquent pas de taux de location de dettes CAD d'intrt?    3. Il y a deux types d'migration des africains : la fuite des cerveaux, et la fuite pour la vie.  Le dpart des africains pour l'tranger est du a :    - A l'absence de libert dans des rgimes autoritaristes et dictatoriaux;  - A la prolifration de la corruption;  - A l'augmentation du ch?mage dont les causes sont l'attribution arbitraire des emplois, et la prfrence de main-d?uvre europenne a celle africaine pourtant tout autant sinon plus qualifie (ceci se constate bien videmment le plus souvent dans les multinationales implantes dans les pays);  - La famine, la guerre...    Mais lis ceci et tu comprendras que l'tat dplorable de nos pays malgr leurs richesses est encourag par l'Europe et plus prcisment la France. Lis ceci : http://membres.lycos.fr/dieudosoutien/ar...  Tu verras que le Cameroun, le plus corrompu de la plante, le Togo, champion du monde de vitesse en rvision de constitution (moins de 5 heures de temps ont t largement suffisant) dans l'ultime but d'installer le fils de l'ami personnel de Chirac, le Gabon o le snile et non moins tartuffe BONGO rgne depuis des lustres et si par la grace des dieux, a prostate ne vient pas l'y dloger, il passera toute sa vie au pouvoir au grand dam des gabonais et au grand plaisir de la mre patrie etc. Ces pays sont de "bons lves" de la France si ce n'est de Chirac pour paraphraser l'incomptent BIYA dont la prvarication est le symbole de sa gouvernance et dont la phrase  l'endroit |`|1263b9724a038cff617e4fb259696393aa	Voil une rponse bien tlguide :  "100 ans sous l'autorit fran?aise" : faux, c'est 132 ans...   "perte de leur culture, langue et identit" : faux, les habitants (peu nombreux dans les annes 1830)  de cette contre sans nom (le mot Algrie n'a t invent qu'aprs l'arrive des Europens) n'avaient pas d'identit particulire, puisqu'ils taient de plusieurs ethnies ... ...  "la france a fait venir ces immigrs pour faire le travail que les Fran?ais ne voulais pas faire: autoroute, metro, rer, mines charbon" : la France n'a pas oblig, manu militari, ces personnes  venir travailler ; la France les a pays pour les travaux effectus ; la France n'a pas fait appel qu' des algriens...    Dites un peu, lorsque vous avez des travaux  faire faire dans votre logement, vous appelez un ouvrier, et quand il a fini, vous le payez ; mais vous lui demandez aussi de rester habiter chez vous, puis d'amener toute sa famille et tout son village ???   "aujourd'hui ils sont de trop ils n'ont qu'a retourner chez eux" :   faux ; ceux qui sont en France depuis de longues dcennies et ont opt, en 1962, pour la nationalit fran?aise sont fran?ais,  part entire, et personne ne leur demande quoi que ce soit ; par contre, ceux qui ont choisi  ce moment-l d'tre algriens, et ceux qui n'ont rien connu de la colonisation parce que ns aprs 1962, n'ont rien  faire en France, tout de mme ! Ils ont un pays, leur pays, et leur devoir est de s'occuper de ce pays.   Voil une petite mise au point de faite ! Mais personne n'a le courage, la sincrit de dire la vrit : s'ils viennent en France, c'est parce que chez eux, la vie est trop dure, les outils trop lourds, le courage trop rare, l'honneur inexistant !

T'es all en Afrique dans une ONG? Tu t'es renseign un peu sur la ralit du continent???  L'indpendance???? Tu ne sais pas comment ca s'est pass peut-tre?

"Un prix soi-diasnt plus bas que la march international"...Mais, renseigne toi sur qui  a le pouvoir. Au Congo- Brazzaville, Le prsident Pascal Lissouba ( au pouvoir jusqu'en 1997) s'est fait renvers sous l'oeil de la Francafrique parce qu'il n'avait pas compris qu'il ne pouvait pas grer comme il l'entendait les ressources ptrolires de son pays.  Aujourd'hui, l'Europe deverse des tonnes de poulet, de surplus en Afrique, grace  des susides  l'exportation, mettant  mal les producteurs locaux. Renseignes toi aussi sur les problmes des subventions du Nord de coton ou de bananes qui cassent le "march" et entravent les producteurs africains....  Les raisons qui les incitent  quitter leur pays???? Elles sont conomiques et aussi politiques ( ne l'oublions pas). Tant qu'il y aura des riches et des pauvres, des exploiteurs et des opprims, on empechera jamais les gens de vouloir traverser des frontires....Fermer nos frontires, c'est encore plus prsenter la forteresse Europe comme un paradis....

Donc je ne pense pas qu'on puisse s'en prendre  l'homme du peuple au Maroc, par exemple, pour critiquer la concession des grands complexes touristiques  venir  des entreprises espagnoles, amricaines ou saoudiennes. De plus, je te rappelle que le libralisme conomique est (heureusement ou malheureusement,  toi de juger) de mise dans le monde. Donc pourquoi les pays d'Afrique feraient du rotectionnisme quand nous pr?nons l'inverse pour apporter de la croissance  une conomie?

RA3p25Qoaa	The majority of seals are shot not killed with the hakipik. Oddly enough when the sealers association wanted to ban " clubbing" member of the HSUS were opposed saying that not allowing clubbing would be inhumane. Is it just me or is something fishy here, they flip out over seals being killed with hakipiks but don't want them taken out of practice?    I see no issue with a trained sealer striking a seal No different than the way many cows are killed. only the strike is automated in a slaughter house.     I'm from Newfoundland so I grew up learning about the real hunt not this baby killing sport some people seem to think is going on. Sealing has never been a sport, it's not done by thugs, and " baby seals" haven't been killed since 1987.     I have no issue with the seal hunt by First Nations people or those of European heritage.  I think it should be regulated so that the population remains stable. There are 5 million harp seals off the coast of Newfoundland so they're far from endangered.  I also think that so called animal rights activists need to smarten up and realize they are holding back habitat stewardship.|`|PPKuHl9baa	I think it's a pretty good sport.

I wish they would realise that the Animals on this Earth   were the first to inherit it and        really have more right to it than Humans have. Maybe they should take that into account when they go around killing all the time.

It's sad because a great deal of my views are libertarian though I'm smart enough to realize the way to succeed is by being in one of the two parties and trying to influence them toward your beliefs.  Clearly most libertarians should be Republicans and that is why I try very hard to bring the Republican party back toward the constitution.  I hope you join me in this endeavor though please be realistic and look at how many votes the libertarians received in their races.  It's common for they to be well below 5% and I'm being very generous with this number.  This is just enough to make sure Republican's don't win and Democrats get in office.  This is also a large enough number to have an influence within a party though not one out on it's own.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Not sure, but if the American people have any sense at all or more than two brain cells to rub together, it create an opening for even the village idiot.

That goes against the very fiber of Washington politics. Both parties want to grow government, because it gives them greater power. Neither side is going to share the sandbox with a new kid, especially when the new kid want to make the sandbox smaller.<br>  <br>  I've said it before, but it bears repeating. The libertarian ideal is "of the people" it is a grassroots movement. It must start at the local level, and grow from there. Since our policies are based on a smaller federal government, why would we put a huge emphasis on federal politics? We must make our state and local representatives the ruling powers in our lives, and cut the federal government back to its constitutional beginnings. Thankfully, the feds are doing everything they can to help us.

Cuando desde el ALBA se sostiene que la unidad debe avanzar por nuevos caminos, priorizando lo social, lo cultural y lo poltico, vale decir el pago de la deuda social con los pueblos; como asimismo avanzar en lo econmico a partir de la cooperacin, complementacin, solidaridad y respeto a las soberanas, se plantan slidas bases para ir ms all de un simple proceso de acuerdos como los conocidos hasta el momento.  La participacin popular, en todos los procesos abiertos en los pases integrantes del ALBA, son la garanta del nuevo modelo unionista. En salud, educacin, asistencia tcnica, cultura, economa popular, gnero, pueblos originarios, seguridad social, defensa nacional, medio ambiente y todos los rubros involucrados en el mejoramiento de la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos, ya comienzan a aparecer lineamientos de trabajo mancomunados que ayudarn a solucionar problemas comunes de cada uno de los pases y de difcil resolucin encarados individualmente.    Como ejemplo de lo mencionado, podemos citar el la lucha por la erradicacin del analfabetismo. Cuba ya hace muchos a?os fue declarada pas libre de este flagelo. Venezuela ha seguido el mismo rumbo. Nicaragua tiene una vasta experiencia al respecto y tanto Bolivia como Ecuador han iniciado la gesta en pos de erradicar definitivamente este mal. La educacin por lo tanto, en todas sus etapas, pasa a cumplir un rol fundamental para estos gobiernos. Si pensamos que en pocos a?os, como lo ha alcanzado Cuba, todos los pases involucrados en el ALBA tendrn una educacin de excelencia, gratuita, obligatoria y con contenidos adaptados al nuevo modelo transformador, fcil ser deducir la potencialidad del ALBA ante  el ALCA.   Venezuela, Bolivia y Ecuador son pases petroleros y, los dos primeros, grandes productores de gas. El tema energtico por lo tanto, vital para cualquier tipo de desarrollo endgeno, se presenta dentro de las fortalezas a contabilizar. Si a esto le sumamos los pasos ya emprendidos para desarrollar una poderosa industria petroqumica y la potencialidad hidroelctrica de varios de los pases involucrados, podemos afirmar que el ALBA cuenta con recursos envidiables en un mundo donde la problemtica energtica adquiere dimensiones complejas.     El oriente de Bolivia como el occidente y centro venezolano son zonas sumamente aptas para la produccin ganadera. La agricultura, a travs de la reforma agraria y la lucha contra el latifundio que se lleva adelante en estos pases, con la ayuda crediticia necesaria, el suministro de maquinarias agrcolas y la capacitacin tcnica adecuada para el campesinado, impone un incentivo enorme para alcanzar en corto plazo la seguridad y soberana alimentaria. Maz, soya, ca?a de azcar, cacao, caf, frutas, papa, caraotas, yuca y legumbres son producciones importantes, si se tiene en cuenta que ya no sern solo para usufructo de los terratenientes y la burguesa vinculada al comercio exterior, sino en beneficio de toda la poblacin.      En cada uno de los pases del ALBA existe un potencial enorme de biodiversidad como lo hay en pocas zonas del planeta. Si a esto le sumamos el desarrollo alcanzado por la industria farmacutica cubana, podemos deducir las posibilidades que se abren en esta materia. Asimismo a este potencial, habra que agregarle el aporte de los saberes y conocimientos de las culturas milenarias originarias.      En minerales tambin existe una riqueza inmensa en la sumatoria de los cinco pases: hierro, aluminio, bauxita, nquel, esta?o, oro, carbn por ejemplo. La instalacin de altos hornos y la construccin de importantes plantas siderrgicas evitar la tradicional exportacin de materias primas, incorporar valor agregado y proveer de suministros estratgicos para el desarrollo de la industria nacional.      Tampoco es subestimable el hecho de que los pases adherentes al ALBA poseen una inmensa riqueza en agua potable; considerando el valor estratgico del vital lquido en un futuro inmediato.      En el plano geopoltico hay que contemplar la posibilidad real de la construccin de un nuevo canal que atravesara el territorio nicaragense conectando las aguas del Atlntico con las del Pacfico. Esta empresa, incluida en el programa del Presidente Daniel Ortega, aprovechara las ventajas que presenta la geografa de Nicaragua y abrira un espacio ms para el flujo del comercio entre los continentes.     A ms de dos a?os de la fundacin del ALBA, cuidar que la plantita sembrada crezca derecha y fuerte ser responsabilidad de todo el pueblo organizado de la Patria Grande, sin dejar de pensar, en el breve plazo, en avanzar en la conformacin de un poderoso movimiento poltico revolucionario y unionista latinoamericano caribe?o. Creemos que la hora de la Amrica Latina Caribe?a ha llegado. Que as sea est en nuestras manos.|`|ff11259ccbf7a60f1689709acd100878aa	ya salio el john negroponte, amigo intimo de bush, alardeando sobre la pseudo derrota de este tratado......    se ve que le pegaron donde mas dolia a estos imperialistas.

There is nothing pure or wholesome about this rogue group of opportunistic thugs and, like all despots Bush will fall down hard and shatter into a million pieces, much like a China doll perched too close to the edge of a high table. Unfortunately for the rest of us commoners this crumbling and decay will bring us all down in the long-term, seeing as how we can't get out from under this beast. Bush and his ilk are like an incurable cancer that will not go away no matter how many protests and public disgust and outcries you bombard it with.

In the last election, the primaries up to Florida were by and large "open". Thus, both Democrats and Independents could attend a Republican primary and vote for their choice.     Let us suppose that their choice was the candidate whom they thought the Democrat they wanted elected could most likely beat.    That a bunch of Democrats or Independents gave a victory to say John McCain in early primaries is no barometer of John McCain being the choice of Republicans.    Of course this goes both ways as well.    Open primaries do a huge disservice to the electoral system (as does having a myriad of dates for them).

8Mi15cTtaa	The prospects for the 2010 midterms look great - I hope we can fire a bunch of these democrap weasels!    37%! That great! A couple of days ago it was 54%!!!     When can I start saying "I told you so" to all the naive people that voted for this looser? Can I start now or should I wait a month or until after the stimulus catastrophe passes and the economy tanks even more? (I'd like to be fair about this.)|`|2Srjjs4Maa	This is just great.     The liberals Dear Leader has also passed SCHIP and to pay for it he is raising taxes on cigarettes. Of course the non thinking liberals will say "GOOD, **** THOSE SMOKERS".    http://smoking.info2you.net/?p=30    But, as this article shows, blacks and the poor make up the highest percentage of smokers.    So why is it that B. Hussein wants to raise taxes on the poor and blacks? Didn't he say during the campaign that if you make less than $250,000 a year, you wont' see your taxes go up one bit? Didn't he make that claim? Well, looks like he broke that promise, because if you make less than $250,000 a year and you smoke, your taxes just went up. OOOOOOPSSSS!    Now, I am sure the leftwing loons will say, this is good because the high taxes will act as a deterrent to smoking. Which then begs the question, if people quit smoking, then where will the money come from to pay for SCHIP?    I mean if you really want to fund healthcare for the chillen, then shouldn't you be encouraging people to smoke as much as possible? I think as a companion rule, B. Hussein should make it mandatory to smoke in public spaces including airplanes.

But already we're seeing that Obama's not what the Libby press presented him as being.    A lot of Libbys are backpeddling now.  They were oh-so sure of themselves before, so annoyingly in-your-face with their "victory", and now they're getting a little less strident, a little less boisterous.    So many Obama voters were thinking like little children, literally.  I heard adults talking absolute nonsense, making claims that were just absurd.    By the way, I checked out a previous question of yours, regarding the huge chasm between the Democrats and Republicans at their conventions.    The Democrats didn't want to be embarrassed by homeless people, so they offered to get their hair cut for free so they'd look more presentable if they were caught on camera.  And yes, it was just a sickening Gimme Gimme, Where's Mine? affair.    In stark contrast, the Republicans quietly and without fanfare gave the homeless and the poor free meals.  They didn't try to spruce them up.  At the country, it was touching for them to have "Country First" signs, something that should have embarrassed the entitlement crazed Libbys.  But as my mother used to say, "No sense, no feeling."|`|wbIEau0qaa	heres my excuse, i oppose the bill !! that might be why the approval rating is only 37%? or maybe you think 63% of america is republican|`|6QOKsVaPaa	The only reason its above 5% is those who approve of it haven't read it.|`|BfFI7TUsaa	THERE'S ONE THING THAT I DO KNOW AND THAT IS I'M SO GLAD THAT BUSH *** IS GONE BECAUSE HE WASN'T TRYING TO DO A DAMN THING AND IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU WAS THE VERY ONES THAT STOLE HIS BUTT IN THE OVAL OFFICE TWO TIMES IN THE FIRST PLACE AND GOT THIS COUNTRY IN THE SHAPE IT'S IN !!!!!!|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Obama's first big plan was to fill his cabinet with tax cheats.

Some of his cabinet members where not the best pick. Pelosi, Janet N.and several others could have been left where they came from. Bush made huge cabinet mistakes as well, so it's not like this is the first time. Pretty much every President have picked some back cabinet members for their staff. His other mistake is being in the spotlight too much. I know he like a celebrity to many people, but he needs to work behind the scene more and come out only when something critical needs to be said. That's why he has a speaker to address the media. I think he has done an admirable job so far considering how terrible the country has been left in after Bush's departure.|`|rVPrhd26aa	so far I don't think he has done anything wrong. He didn't know about the tax stuff, and now that he does he fired those involved. you can't expect the president to drop everything important to personally himself look into the tax history of every member of the government. If the president did that, he wouldn't have time to do anything else. Do you really want a president that just researches their staff all day long and does nothing else? What about that these same people who had the job when bush was president... you don't hear people saying Bush spent his whole 8 years with tax fraud going on right i his office do you? But that's what happened so why should Obama take any blame for something that was going on already.
GGDPbT8taa	No the 47% of us that voted against Obama fear becoming more socialist too.  Yes, raprunr, there are socialist programs today, but they are all a disaster, you should really do your research as well.

Because when it hit's the tipping point, there will be so many people in jail, no one will be left to support the prison system, so that's when slave labor comes in. Why do you think the US is building prisons at a record pace, while schools go to hell.  Please think about that.|`|fB0gmEioaa	True Capitalism died in this country 90 years or so ago and has had some form of Socialism mixed into it's Capitalist system.

I estimate that at least 60% of this country do not like what they see.|`|tJpP8VRyaa	I am so sick of hearing this.... Republicans just say this over and over again, but never say why it is a bad thing.    Read up on Socialism and Communism, they are great systems of government.

The media (ie.. cnn, hln, cbs, nbc) spent the entire election kissing Obamas butt rather than reporting the facts (fairly at least) so now alot of people don't really know who they elected(I voted for mcain simply because I did not rely on anyone else to do my homework for me) so keep informed and keep voicing your concerns we can not walk around like blind sheeple following the "chosen one". We must stay informed and alert it is the only way to be sure we don't spend another 8 (hopefully 4) in the dark.
RW7i5RgNaa	Hey dont listen to all of the rude people out there, My husband just graduated from Fort Leonardwood 2 weeks ago, no you wont be able to go visit him but the day of graduation you will get to spend all day with him after he graduates until about 10 that night, then the next day he ships off to AIT, trust me its hard but it does get better, my husband was depressed for awhile too but I PROMISE it will go by fast. He will have so much to do and just keep telling him how proud of him you are and how much you love him. It will help.|`|EbQBD5D5aa	Im sorry but you arent allowed to visit him. If you showed up, they wouldnt allow you access to see him. My brother is at the same base for BCT, and they said they got rid of it because of the MP training, They need to get them out of training asap, because as soon as they graduate they can replenish the current ranks. Im sorry that your boyfriend is depressed, BCT is hard, thankfully it is a short time and will be over soon. My husband is in BCT, and his AIT and BCT together are 10 months.|`|Nzm0O9UOaa	You wouldn't be able to see him, and if you found your way to his starship. they would get rid of you and smoke him and make him hate life. You can see him on familiy day. It is the day before graduation here at Ft Sill. He is probably suffering from seraration anxiety. It happens a lot. Just be kind and wait it out.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and he would get an article 15. You could be charged with a federal felony for being on post.|`|otFCWMuUaa	no ones allowed to visit during basic.. n all of them go thru this and its part of the training process to be cut off from their loved ones. one of many prices you pay to serve our country..<br>  <br>  when he goes to AIT however you can go see him on weekend after the first few weeks..which a 3 hour drive seems like nothing when you know how bad you want to see eachother...|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	You won't get past the gate, so showing up unannounced will be a waste of time and gas. Basic is stressful...it is SUPPOSED to be. He will be fine. Just tell him you love and support him, are proud and can't wait to see him. He needs to hear positive things from you.|`|VVCpJFxtaa	No, they would turn you away at the gate as you have no legit business being there.<br>  Not to mention the he** he may catch from his Drill Sergeant for your little unannounced visit. He may assume that your boyfriend had something to do with it.|`|cpUdSkJbaa	nope<br>  <br>  not until family day, which is either the day before or the day of graduation...i can't remember|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Best to let him complete his basic and see him at the graduation ceremony.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	If you showed up unannounced?  They would turn you away at the gate because you don't have ID to get on post.<br>  <br>  Reassure him, for cryin' out loud it's only 10 weeks.|`|lQ3uor3jaa	Lol, no. What do you think Basic is? Geez, why are people so stupid. <br>  <br>  Just going to have to wait until Family day/Graduation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and it's Fort Leonard Wood.|`|AA10604086	No.Going there would be a waste of time and money,. You would be told he is on a work detail or is restricted to the barracks, and barracks are off limits to women.<br>   He is really depressed? That is part of basic training. It  is up to him to deal with it . That's all part of the training. I am sorry, but don;t you think ALL men who went through basic got lonely and depressed at one time or other. you just have to deal with it and get over it.<br>  <br>  Rawberthas a good point.  you get up, get dessed, clear the barracks, have a parade, listen to some long winded colonel,. then rush like hell to the airport or bus station because you  have only 24 hours to tranvel from one end the country to another.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	Not until graduation, or if he gets a family day (I think they need to get rid of that)<br>  <br>  Baisc is short, why disrupt it for one day of visiting. Do your training and move on.<br>  <br>  Just tell him that you are proud of him and can't wait until graduation so you can see him|`|AA11828439	Nope, if you were to show up you would not be admitted to the base. Basic training is making a man out of him. Let him grow up without holding his hand. He will be better for it.|`|AA10057599	you can visit on family day when he graduates.  until then you and he are just gonna have to suck it up and drive on
XRYAfxpTaa	Hire a good immigration attorney. Be prepared for your husband to have to return to Mexico for an interview which will be denied and then your attorneys will file for a waiver.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Hire a lawyer.|`|i0LUuhyLaa	People have given you the right answer. A girl got mad at me the other day for telling her the approval of the I30 only meant basically it was accepted and he would be denied when she filed the 485. The only person I know that adjusted their status without leaving the country was based on hardship because her husband had a medical condition. It was a very costly battle and took a long time. Good luck to you.|`|QE71sNC3aa	You should just go to Mexico and live with your people.|`|eY6FTeHoaa	email me i can hook u up|`|yTdQUqVRaa	You were given incorrect information in regards to what to file. <br>  <br>  Your husband is ineligible to adjust status within the US as he entered without inspection (i.e. he didn't have a valid visa when he arrived). He is only able to go through Consular processing, which means that he would have to return to Mexico for the interview process. You should contact USCIS to ensure that the file is forwarded to the NVC.<br>  <br>  He will be denied once more at the interview due to the 10 year bar placed on him due to his illegal presence in the US, but you can then file an I-601 waiver to try and overcome that. You need to prove extreme hardship to yourself and your children should you be forced to move to Mexico to be with your husband.<br>  <br>  I would suggest speaking with a reputable immigration attorney, particularly for the waiver process.|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	You filed an application whereby your husband is not eligible to adjust his status because he entered the country without inespection (EWI).  You seriously need to consult an immigration attorney.  Immigration law is federal law and any attorney can represent you in your matter.<br>  <br>  The I-130 application is an immigrant petition for a foreign family member.  All that the I-130 proves is that you have a bona fide marriage to the foreign national; and therefore, you are eligible to sponsor him.  However, the I-485 is an application to adjust from one status to become a permanent resident.  Certain aliens are not authorized to adjust his or her status and EWI is one of them.  <br>  <br>  Now that you have an approved I-130, you have to request the USCIS to forward the application to the National Visa Center, and they will in turn forward to the Consular office abroad.  Your husband must go to his home country and interview at the consular office.  Depending on the consular office, you have to file an I-601 Waiver along with the immigrant application.  If the consular office is in Juarez Ciudad, the waiver must be filed only AFTER the consular office denied the immigrant visa because he previously entered the U.S. illegally.  He must show that it would be an extreme hardship for you and your children and may be other U.S. citizens and permanent resident family members if he were denied entry into the U.S.  This is very difficult to prove.<br>  <br>  As such, again, I advise that you seek legal assistance from an experienced immigration lawyer.  If you are interested, please visit our website for more information.  Nothing stated here or on our website should be used to replace a consultation and representation by an attorney.  There are issues of facts that your attorney would need to properly file your applications.<br>  <br>  Steven Tuan Pham, Esq.
hyHvG1Olaa	The Philippines and the United States of America both allow "dual citizenship" and many filipinos who are United States citizens still maintain their Philippine passport.  Off hand it would seem that travel would be easier in the Philippines and southeast Asia with a Philippine passport than an American.  Also with the threats of terrorism I personally would feel safer traveling to areas like Mindanao on a Philippine passport especially if I was traveling to the western part of the island.  the same argument could be made for Indonesia or any other predominately Muslim country.  What ever you decide congratulations on your United States citizenship.|`|xaEcAgTqaa	The advantage of having two passport is that you can travel to certain countries visa-free on one passport that you may not be able to travel to on the other passport. I can't think of an example with a Philippine passport off the top of my head, but e.g. if you had both a US and a Bahraini passport you could travel to most of Europe visa-free on the Us passport and to most of Arabia visa-free on your Bahraini passport.    If you don't renew your Philippine passport nothing will happen in the short term. Note however that as a Philippine citizen, you must enter and leave the Philippines on your Philippine passport, so if you're planning on going there soon, get your old one renewed.|`|AA10258539	If you wish to enter the Philippines and stay for a longer period than allowed on your US passport, then it would be prudent to renew your Philippine passport. But if you do not plan on returning to the Philippines in the immediate future, just renew it when you need it. Congratulations on your second citizenship.
YilqTjNuaa	well, America and Europe are very very similar.. but if we see the way of life, All the world in culture is similar to Europe... we can say that americas culture is to rule the world and this thing is possible from the last 50 years, because Europe has loose his power during 2 world wars ... and this allowed to America and Russia to increase his power.. however histroy since roman and greek empire to 2 world war and  after 50 years.. see Europe llike protagonist.. now EUrope  understand that can take aagain his powerful role.. and if Europe is really united can be again the world power state|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	There is no difference in the way they think, only what they think about.  The West is far more likely to be focused on money, jobs etc. and so is Asia to a certain extent. If you live in Africa, you're far more likely to be worried about drought, famine, civil war etc.    People don't tend to think in terms of "are we trying to fix something" etc. more in terms of their immediate needs and aims, whatever they are.|`|XPlrVATJaa	i tell you what is the difference and am not being racist or prejudice . America wants to rule the world and rely on others using their mineral and other resources. Then you get EU , all the EU countries are supportive to the US government to an extent but they are less supportive to violence. Africa is the wealthiest and the most starved nation. In africa you can find everything but unfortunately the traditional owners don't have money to eat.In Asia, people have more social life. They respect the family ties and the culture and am saying that the western world doesnt have that trait but of a lesser value. thanx

AA11752525	Dear Joseph,                   I do not know your age or experience but understand that it is impossible to underestimate the absence of basic competence, common sense or care exhibited at any time by any governmental organization.                    Far too many government employees take their job as an "entitlement' they are free to discharge as they wish. This tars the hard-work and honest efforts of millions of hardworking intense and competent government employees. I am sorry.                       The SEC minions, including attorneys personally known by me, had no criminal connection or illegal financial gain through their missing the Madoff scheme. Notwithstanding, some were from the biggest L.A. law firms and took on the work as a resume filler, political connection factory. I do not doubt they regret their investigative inactivity but that changes nothing.....|`|AA11565799	The SEC was warned repeatedly for several years.  Madoff ripped off so many investors.  Even Sandy Koufax!  Maybe the SEC gave Madoff a free pass at first because he had been with the NASD, but after the reports kept coming in, how could the SEC not have dug deeper?  It makes no sense.  Of course, the SEC was asleep at the wheel during the mortgage securities crisis of 2007 and 2008.
AA11494150	That is probably a docket number assigned  by the court where your case was heard. I doubt you will find anything online, because cases were not automated 11 years ago. I doubt many courts go through the time and expense to enter past cases online.  You will probably need to call the courthouse where you case was heard.

In my experience, college students don't have nearly as much on the ball as you seem to have.    By the way, that tea party? As you point out, it was a 'protest' against an increased tea tax. What the history books do not mention, because the event is apparently so hallowed, is the fact that even with that tax in the colonies, tea was still about half the price in the colonies as it was at the time in Great Britain. That 'protest' was manufactured by Sam Adams who ran the local news paper. Sam and his 'paper' created the 'crisis' and the protest was the result.

Why not everyone donate money to build the border or be a volunteer to help build the border, instead of sitting here whining.    In addition, it is the border security issues that can hardly prevents people from crossing the border while there has not been enough forces to protect the border.

6v1LIdcaaa	The power of the Executive Branch is vested in the President of the United States, who also acts as head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the federal agencies, including the Cabinet. The Vice President is also part of the Executive Branch, ready to assume the Presidency should the need arise.    The Cabinet and independent federal agencies are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws. These departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities as widely divergent as those of the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Including members of the armed forces, the Executive Branch employs more than 4 million Americans.

c84392b9a2d40d0627516c90b846601baa	Adrian. La respuesta seria Israel ataco Libano para terminar con el Hezbola, pero es conveniente analizar que esta detras de todo este conflicto.  Hezbola se esconde entre la comunidad Libanesa, esto es entre civiles, y desde el sur de Libano ataca Israel, es bien sabido que USA da soporte en todos los sentidos a Israel, y por otro lado Iran a el Hezbola. Bien, este conflicto va mas alla de Israel-Libano. El gobierno Irani espera que le pongan a USA enfrente para que se de un conflicto.  La matanza tal vez sea similar, pero el motivo es diferente, en irak es un problema de poder economico con tintes relacionados con el petroleo, yo destruyo el pais y despues yo mismo lo reconstruyo $$$$, USA-IRAN es un motivo de poder nuclear.

En cuanto a la legalizacin de la marihuana, tampoco debera ser muy traumtico. Con y sin legalizar, quien la consume es porque quiere y a nadie se le obliga.

9WdfqDNkaa	According to the Chicago Tribune,  Antoin "Tony" Rezko, one of Obama's main political contributors, was arrested Monday morning for concealing a $3.5 million payment the indicted slumlord received from a Beruit company tied to a certain Nadhmi Auchi, a Iraqi billionaire embroiled in a corruption scandal in France  Auchi participated in more than just Rezko's pizza and property ventures, however; he also contributed to Barack Obama's campaign by donating to a 2005 fundraiser through a company of which is wife is a Director.  I quote the relevant paragraph from a London Times exclusive:    The donation is significant, for some believe Barack Obama may be one of the unnamed "Illinois government officials" mentioned in the following ABC News report on the FBI affidavit filed in US Attorney Fitzgerald's case against Rezko before Obama's political godfather was arrested on Monday:    Mr. Auchi was a leading supplier of arms to Saddam's regime. A former Belgian ambassador to Luxembourg charged that a bank in Luxembourg owned principally by Mr. Auchi laundered funds -- including oil for food money -- for Saddam and other Islamic dictators.      These are interesting articles.  Did Obama's friendship with Rezko cause him to speak out against the war?  These are just 2 shady characters in Obama's life.  Rezko is on trial.      UPDATE to the one above me.  Obama found a loophole to them being called lobbyists.  You are blind to think that companies do not give employees money to send in,  or tell them to donate after getting a "bonus".   Obama is corrupt just like most in Illinois.|`|f2af9abbd07b024c845bf28f97ee9b35aa	foreign contributions are BANNED and ILLEGAL.    to qualify to make a donation to Obama, you must be a US citizen or green card holder.      Anyone who does not meet these requirements is not allowed to donate. Every donator has to sign a pledge, of these requirements and must give his full name, address and employer too to the Obama campaign before the donation is processed.    Obama is running a very honest and clean campaign. Its you guys who are doing dirty campaign.  Obama doesn't even accept funds from lobbyists, while Mccain does.    You should ask yourself, why so many citizens are donating in such heavy numbers to Obama. Maybe because they can see the facts clearly which blind obama bashers can't.|`|AA10932670	Yep, that would not be impossible.

Refineries expand all the time.  That's part of the reason why new ones aren't being built, because it's cheaper for the oil companies to consolidate resources.  New refineries aren't being built because the oil companies aren't seeking permission to do so.  The gas tax holiday WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED! That's the political reality, one that has nothing to do with Obama's position.  Even if it had you would have still been paying nearly $4 a gallon because the "holiday" would have only affected federal taxes.  The state taxes, which is the largest portion of the total tax, would not be affected.  Expansion of nuclear energy production can't be address until the issue of what to do with the waste is solved.  This problem has been building for decades and both political parties are to blame.  Finger pointing accomplishes NOTHING.  Obama has correctly pointed out that the quickest way to reduce our dependence on oil is to reduce consumption.|`|m6JwqdSXaa	No, because smart people know McCain is hyping a false quick fix.  Experts say it will take years before we see results and it wont make a dent in our $4 gas prices..|`|AA11210239	When you see how those stands negatively effect national security, it is sure to drive more people who are undecided towards Senator McCain.|`|MZiMOoR0aa	I hope so. Obama does not have a clue as to how to solve the energy crisis. Americans must drill for American oil. Nuclear energy is a clean was to generate unlimited electicity. But Obama has said no to these plans. What a stupid foolish man.|`|W7yjCmXOaa	I can tell you one thing... McCain has sure changed his tune on drilling as well as FL Gov. Charlie Crist and other elected officials.  I truly believe it is because the people have overwhelmingly made it clear that that is what we want.  Between 60-70 % of the US wants drilling and our politicians are hearing us!|`|LcB2fmZCaa	The only illogical energy policy happening right now is John McWar embracing George W/ Bush's energy policy.  When are we going to realize that leaving energy & environmental problems for the next generation to solve is no longer an option?    We're running out of oil.  Drilling for more oil is only delaying the inevitable problem: oil is not a sustainable energy source.  Why waste another decade trying to get as little as a 2 year oil supply?  Not only does it not make sense, it's a complete waste of money to keep going after an obsolete fuel supply.  We have the technology to move the whole country AWAY from oil!    Yes other countries are MORE self-sufficient but they also embrace alternative technologies and renewable, sustainable energy practices.  Why are republicans so afraid to change?  Oh I know, they are all tied in with GM and the oil moguls who want to strip the earth bare in order to maximize profits until the very end.    Well that is no longer acceptable to me.  It is not my son or grandson's responsibility to fix our energy crisis.  It's not going to go away, so let's stop being complete retards and fix the problem without DESTROYING the last pristine habitat we own.  How about that?|`|N5jBMjrDaa	Wow.  He hasn't been elected yet and he can single-handedly stop off-shore drilling, refineries and nuclear energy.  You are wrong about nuclear energy.  He has not refused to "allow" it.  The gas tax holiday was a gimmick and it backfired.  Let it go.  If you are interested (and I am sure you are not), you can educate yourself on Obama's energy policies.  It would really help you out the next time you post.    To answer your question, no.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	No, because like many voters Obama knows that drilling won't effect the price of oil under his presidency. By the time that those sites come on line he will be part way through his second term (if he has one) and any benefit will be felt by the next president, not by him.    Oil is high because of market speculation and because of silly people in gas guzzlers panicking every few minutes.    There are also many voters who are pro-environment and who support this policy. They would rather see Hummers priced of of the roads than our oceans and tundra spoiled. It will take the US a couple of generations to make the country more fuel efficient, but 100 times longer to repair the damage caused by all of the spills and pollution caused by oil exploration.|`|3tV94oGMaa	I certainly hope it is his undoing. He is against drilling offshore and in ANWAR because it won't solve "short-term" energy problems. Well, duhhhh? But how about a long-term solution? If politicians thought about the long-term issues 20 or 30 years ago, maybe we wouldn't be where we are today. Obama's shortsightedness is dangerous and politically expedient, pandering to those people too selfish or ignorant to see more than a few days down the road.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	No.  The oil companies don't want to set up new drilling sites or refineries.

yaCCJNKEaa	Amanda, your best bet is to go to onestop.army.mil and pull up fort stewart from the floor plans section.  Then it will take you to that post's privatized housing site.  At that point you can go to the FAQS section or find the number to call.  Sometimes housing offices will give you a guesstimate on the wait time.  Please do not be worried, you will be fine.

RYQ3i0ZNaa	Yes, after looking at your case he has decided that you are highly likely to win, and so will be able to claim the costs from your employer, or indeed charge you and your partner. Also, it would not be a major loss for him if you did not win - $750-1000 is relatively little in comparison to other cases, which probably win him fees of $10 000+|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Your attorney believes there is enough potential for a settlement for him to take the risk of getting nothing but the contingency fee if you win will be higher than you would pay at regular hourly rates.|`|c51ed3fd68dbbc18322e2b41a772c974aa	Many lawyers who are specialised in a certain field work on this basis- the cases that they win subsidize any cases that they might not. It is not guarunteed that the attorney will win the case but he would obvioulsy have considered the merits and not taken on the matter if it was a hopeless case.    But watch out. Lawyers charge fees and disbursements seperately. Fees are what you pay for the attorneys time spent working on the case (most have an hourly rate for their time), whereas disbursements are the expenses he incurs (eg. photocopy charges, phone calls, court stamps, petrol or trnasport costs to and from court etc). So even if he waives his fees he will still bill you for his out of pocket expenses, which can quickly add up.     Some lawyers also work on a contingency basis, ie. if he wins he will take a certain percentage of your winnings in cour, eg 10%.
NJMzhcKhaa	Latinos are the largest minority group in USA right now.  Spain is being used more and more even in government departments.    At the same time, due to the number of Spanish speakers there, trained Spanish teachers are something that US have in excess right now. Lots of schools provide Spanish as their second language classes.    Unless they can't find a Spanish teacher in US and proof it to Dept of Homeland security, they are not suppose to hire a person from outside US.

Why don't you want to testify?  He's just going to do it again you know.|`|RfxyVIh4aa	Absolutely not.  I've never heard of that happening.  Even if the spouse ignores a subpoena and doesn't show up for court, the testimony of the arresting officer should be enough.  Further, a witness is not allowed to refuse to testify (unless doing so would result in self-incrimination).  The prosecutor could still force her to take the witness stand and treat her as a hostile witness - and the court could toss her into jail for contempt if she refuses to answer.<br>  <br>  It is the NORM for DV victims to want to drop charges/get the case dismissed.  This is why the State files charges in DV cases rather than the victim.  The victim is not supposed to have any control over whether the case is prosecuted or dismissed.

ysQHKT6haa	I never had any regret.  There were times that it was rough, but then there were more times that were great.  It's difficult to explain, but there is a feeling of brotherhood that is hard to find anywhere else.  You will do some of the most difficult things you could imagine but also have more fun and see the world as well.  I went to 23 different countries when I was in.  As far as OCS, that is a personal decision.  From the point of view of an enlisted Marine, we had more respect for the mustang officers (prior enlisted).  Enlisting first will give you a better understanding of how to be a good leader and the Marine Corps has a program that allows you to go to school on their dime.  Good luck, whichever way you decide to go.|`|MxlNnsk8aa	Ok i'll tell you now, that i am not a marine. HOWEVER my brother is, he recently enlisted and is in Alabama currently in MOSS (i think thats it) we talk everyday about it so i will try to help you. According to him: life in the Marines is hard, its tough mentally, and physically, and it will "break" you at some point, meaning you jsut might break down and cry. it makes you realize how much you love and miss your family haha. he sometimes regrets it. and it is a great idea to get an idea because it is easier to "rank" up. hope i kind of helped,  i tryed my best.

Remember, the men and women of the U.S. Marine Corps personify the highest level of honor you will ever find.  Your husband deserves an honorable wife, and you will dishonor him if you try to hide your affair from him.  Think of it this way:  If the tables were turned and he cheated on you, how would you feel if he tried to hide it from you?|`|xreWOKBYaa	Tell him, if you want to save your marriage he has a right to know.<br>  <br>  What you did was very wrong, be prepaired for a divorce - because if you were my wife that's what would be happening.<br>  <br>  And if you choose not to tell him, and he finds out - I can tell you it will not be pretty.<br>  <br>  Tell him and truth and let him decide if he still wants you or not.<br>  <br>  (I'm not even going to start on how I feel about this issue, what were you thinking? he is a hero who is saving your *** every day? you have 4 children where is your mind at girl?)|`|AA12041870	He must be fighting for your freedom overseas, huh?

Just google "contributing to minors in (your state)" and see what comes up.|`|T9aVzXlMaa	contributing to a minor... not a real serious offense. But probably will give you some probation time. My suggestion is contact a lawyer and see if they can work out a plea bargain. if you are the "I want to handle it myself" type, call the district attorney and see what you can work out.

HpJ4wwC7aa	All these people who said they can force that on you are wrong. In a public school setting, they can only force you to cut your hair if having your hair longer would present a legitimate safety concern, or would otherwise be disruptive to the mission of learning. <br>  <br>  Having your hair style is speech. It's symbolic speech. If you want to express yourself, you should be allowed to do so. Especially if it was a hairstyle that was related to a religion. For example, some religions, e.g., Judaism, require that the boys have long side burn curls known as "payis." That would present an establishment clause problem as well as freedom of speech if they required Jewish boys to cut them off.<br>  <br>  But I've never heard of a public school having enforced hair cuts. If it is a private school, they can do whatever they want. And if you don't like their policies, go to a different school.<br>  <br>  The problem is, is that challenging it can get quite expensive, and hair styles, might not be as an easy of a win, as written or spoken expression, and if it's not considered political, it might also be dismissed, because the standard of review is much lower. The Supreme Court is a long and expensive way off for you, so in the mean time, if you don't want to get in trouble, I guess you should follow their rules.|`|nbibIzC5aa	Just doing short research into School & Hair & First Amendment on Justia.com, I have found a few cases in which appellants writ of certiorari was denied.  This means that the Supreme Court found no reason to hear the case.  It would appear from this quick search that the school has the right to maintain certain appearances they deem fit.<br>  <br>  Also, under this quick search, it would appear that any constitutional challenge that has appeared under this situation has come under the 14th amendment which states "[n]o state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without the due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."  While appellants attempt to have their case heard under this amendment, there are exceptions to the rule.  Minors while at school do have their rights limited because of the schools primary purpose to provide a safe place to study and learn.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	Oh G*D !  ANOTHER little "my rights" barrack-room lawyer !<br>  <br>  All institutions have their rules and regulations which are perfectly permissable within the law ... no matter how much you may feel they impinge upon your "inviolable freedom".  <br>  <br>  If you don't agree with your school's regulations regarding hair length  ... which is not "freedom of speech", by the way  ...  you can find another school.  QED !<br>  <br>  One day, if/when you are a parent, you will want to set certain rules and standards for your children.  Maybe they'll want to find another family if they disagree with your "authority".|`|b81H0vlYaa	In the normal everyday world, then yes.  But I believe schools can do what they want if they have a good, solid reason.  I never did quite understand why they had some of these crazy rules, but they do.  Something about distracting from learning, violence and causing children to be socially left out...usually they can cause it by one of those.<br>  <br>  You could try to petition it if you want, but I doubt you will get very far with it.  They have the right to set a dress code, and that could fall under it.|`|gSwobfujaa	they dont have to listen, they just cant attend that school. all corporations ahve the right to create their own rules and as americans we can decide if we want to follow them or not. the only thing is- if we dont want to follow them we cannot partake in their corporation. its that simple.|`|3RauoUWyaa	well if your under 18, <br>  and your parents are making you,<br>  then youll get in trouble if you dont.<br>  <br>  but if its to keep or get a job, them its a pretty good idea to cut your hair.|`|f0YtsWUTaa	if it is a private school it is not a violation, but if its public and they make you it is|`|AA11506593	The length of a minor's hair is not covered under the First Amendment.

n2oEhdZiaa	Contact an Air Force recruiter and tell him you are only interested in comissioning programs.  He should be able to give you some ground level informaiton and connect you to an Officer.

Good luck.|`|g2yUDLygaa	Here's the deal:  If you are about to graduate with a B.A., your best bet is to apply for a commission once you have your sheepskin in hand.  If you're accepted, you'll go to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama for 18 weeks of OTS.  The poster who said the Air Force school for officers is in Colorado Springs is only partially correct -- that's where the Air Force Academy is, and there's no point in trying to get an appointment to the Air Force Academy since you're so close to getting your B.A.  That and the fact that it's next to impossible to get an appointment to the Air Force Academy unless you have connections on Capitol Hill.<br>  <br>  Assuming you get through the 18 weeks with no problem, you'll become a Second Lieutenant when you graduate.  From there, you'll go to another base to receive training in the job you will do for the Air Force.  There are over a dozen Air Force bases you could go to for that training.  You'll have to commit to at least 4 years of active duty and 4 years of ready reserve in order to be commissioned, but you may find that you like Air Force life so much you want to make a career out of it.<br>  <br>  Your local Air Force recruiter can help.  While it's true that Air Force recruiters are tasked with recruiting enlistees, they can also give you information and phone numbers of people to talk to about applying for a commission as an officer.  If all else fails, call the base operator at Maxwell Air Force Base at (334) 953-1110 and ask for any of the phone numbers at Officer Training School.|`|DV4xyeChaa	AF school for officers is Colorado springs colorado...look in any phone book for a recruter...make sure you sign up for OCS officers cantadate school...GET it in writing....My cus Micheal was in the Air force and my cuz Litle Mike is now in the navy an air traffic controler in Key West...sweet!...thanks for your service. on web...AIRFORCE.com

During the Crewe and Nantwich By Election the Labour party created an absolutely pathetic "Tories are Toffs campaign" It was extremely childish and very pathetic, instead of arguing policies and actions, they got a few students to dress up in Top hats and tails! It was very pathetic! However it seemed to have worked and it is ridiculous!<br>  <br>  DC does not jump around promising tax cuts here and there, vat cuts for shopping and wreckless spending that Gordon Clown does, he speaks with genuine concern but after 11 years of total incompetence and incredible wreckless spending by Labour we need a leader who will carefully rebuild the country. Cameron and his team are the people to do that. even the communist red top newspapers such as the Mirror and Sun cannot critiscise, leading experts in finance and environmentalist societies repeatedly refer to tory policies as spot on! Liebour have taken away all civil liberties and freedoms, the Conservatives will give them back.<br>  Brown cannot stop lying, it is pathalogical, "Thrift and prudence, the end of boom and Bust"!! haha Truth being, "Spend and Borrow, Dont save and Bust, Bust,Bust!! Just who exactly is his advisor Viv Nicholson maybe!! "British jobs for British workers" meaning "British Dole for British Workers" and an absolute cracker that not many have picked up on, during his conference speech, Clown said he is not a politician who uses his family to get attention!! a few minutes before, he was introduced by his wife, the nextday, she is all over the front pages, a few days later his poll ratings go up!! Liebour also won the Glenrothies by election! Who was on the campaign trail? you got it, Mrs Brown!!! a bit of a contradiction I think Gordy!!<br>  <br>  I cant wait to see how many thumbs down I get now from the Brown Alliance lol!!|`|GbiFRG5eaa	No, and for one very simple reason. Apart from a tweak here and there on taxation, no incoming government has ever scrapped the legislation introduced by the outgoing government.<br>  They may spend their time in opposition moaning about it, but once elected the rubbish just carries on.<br>  So unless DC is prepared to close our borders and rethink the pathetic human rights and health and safety acts. and prepares to withdraw us from the EU, then it will be business as usual.<br>  Sure DC may be better than GB in the brain stakes, but he is only the front man, keeping the c**p legislation/policies is the problem.|`|u1F5RRReaa	Being better than Gordon Brown, by the measures of either popularity or effectiveness, would not be difficult at the moment so I'd have to say yes.<br>  In terms of policy I see differences of ceremony but not doctrine.|`|AA11297232	Makes no diffs who the Prime Minister is or would be people will always moan and groan about what should have been done and what needs to be done.

4vWrnOX5aa	BREAK DOWN OF SOCIETY|`|AA11544275	It really won't.  The money is being surplused through consumers, the taxes are taxed, and there will be government loans.  I am in California, and California's unemployment is being funded federally.  Now, California is talking about raising the sales tax to 9.75% and raising the gas tax.  This will help make up the deficient of unemployment benefits.<br>  <br>  In addition, more and more people are moving out of California. That will free up jobs and it'll help sustain when people are back working.|`|teWwRo0laa	The US Government is providing those 5 million people with unemployment pay.<br>  That money comes from taxes paid by those who are employed.<br>  Those 5 million will be collecting unemployment pay as long as taxes are being paid.<br>  Taxes will be paid as long as there is someone employed.<br>  <br>  As for what happens when that money runs out?<br>  Those who are unemployed better grab a job -before- that happens.<br>  If that happens it is because:<br>  A) The Great Depression Version 2.0 <br>  B) The US Government has called of support for unemployment<br>  C) There is no one with a job to pay taxes.<br>  <br>  That's a water-downed answer. Why? Because this is a College Course question.<br>  Economics|`|evB63qWvaa	Hopefully it will never reach that extreme because the point of unemployment is to support those people until they do get a job.  Hopefully by then, they would have not been lazy and dependant on the government for money and would actually get a job and contribute to society and pay taxes that would help people that were in the same boat as they were.|`|XElI4neJaa	Well, if they can't get money then there will be a breakdown in law and order as desperate people try to get food, shelter, warmth and drugs.<br>  <br>  Don't forget, it wasn't that long ago that the people of Ireland were left to starve to death in their fields of rotten potatoes, or that Chinese/African/Indian peasants died in their millions because of starvation (Africans still do this sometimes).|`|qxUNmdd6aa	well, my theory is<br>  by 2012 the gov. is going to plant "chips" in our hand used as money devices.<br>  so they just scan your hand and money goes in or out.<br>  <br>  if i were you i wouldnt get it though cause its a sign of worshiping the devil, and in 2012 there is going to be a RAPTURE, in which Jesus comes down and brings all the believers with him and leaves the rest to rot on earth, which will be known as hell then,<br>  <br>  call me crazy, just a theory|`|GIxctDDuaa	They have to go out and look for a job. That's gonna be the only way to get money.|`|zGvcNgTtaa	Ha, good question, I've wondered the same thing. I guess the people collecting it will just be screwed or the government will make more money to give out to people and the country will get further and further in debt.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	it wont. the democrats have ton's of ink, and are making more everyday, so live it up, for tomorrow we die.|`|U3j7oVflaa	I guess we'll have to stop paying soldiers so much to go interfere with others and use that money to rebuild our own economy.|`|fmDJJobTaa	We are already broke.

You have to find a job before the money runs out.|`|1hciyvKdaa	It wont, they just approved a rate increase starts april 1 this year.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	generally speaking, it really is a thing where the money has run out by the time they have done that. that number really just means a lot of people have done their homework about methods of getting some kind of financial assistance or income.<br>  <br>  look at it this way: if you work with idiots or incompetent or non conscientious people, you're gonna get fired because of that. the unemployment is like an alternative way to get the money you should be making that you are not at the expense of an in efficient system at your job.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Evidently you have no understanding of how unemployment payments work. Workers, you, me and everyone else who works pays into it and then your employers does too. When workers are laid off they collect about 6 months, give or take a few weeks worth of unemployment payments that have already been paid in. When their time is up they either find another job, apply for assistance or starve. THAT's how it works. it isn't just money coming out of taxes.. Even if you've worked for twenty years you still only get 6 months worth so that system won't go broke... it's not designed that way..|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	that will happen in about 8 months.  In the meantime millions more will be added to the list.  It would be my guess they will just do the same thing again, borrow trillions from the Chinese and put us that much more in debt again.   I believe this is Obama's real agenda.  Bankrupt our nation to the point it is pointless.|`|d9L9C4dHaa	get them to apply with ACORN they will be loaded soon.<br>  <br>  Send them to Cali to protect the endangered mice .|`|1oxBCtmZaa	They'll print more money, devaluating the currency.

kzNnMrMHaa	Yes, as long as you have the permits for burial and the proper death documents are in order.
a66nvk0taa	No you can't. French citizenship laws has been updated since 1998. One of your parents would need to be French. but grandparents are already too far. To claim French citizenship, you'd need:<br>  to marry a French person, live with them for four years (or five if you haven't been living in France for at least three years), and speak at least some French,<br>  or to live in France for 5 years (only 2 if you've studied in France or rendered a valuable service to France), and again speak some French.|`|OHfZFR31aa	French citizenship can only be granted through a parent, not a grandparent|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	mémé =do you mean your grand mother?<br>  in getting citizenship from France? you cannot skip a generation, such as in your case: your father,<br>  he would have to claim french citizenship to pass it to you,and then you could actually claim it.
shtP63traa	No, it's not a problem between consenting adults.<br>  <br>  But if the person in the picture is underage, then it could be considered child pornography (there have been several cases lately of teenagers getting in trouble over this sort of thing).|`|AA12103453	Indecent Exposure is trying to make someone see what they don't want to basically. This can't fall under that. Now if you text them to someone underage that is a crime(can't give porno to underage). If the person texting is under-age THAT is a crime. If you are both legal age then do it all you want.|`|nbibIzC5aa	Depends on how old the person is on the receiving end.  If you send them to a child then you could face sexual abuse charges but if not you may be ok.<br>  <br>  Also just remember, whatever you send electronically can be saved and what can be saved can then be distributed if this relationship should end.  Just something to think about.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Probably, but personally, I don't have a problem with it. They are having problems in the schools lately and it made the news and they are trying to make it illegal...|`|z0EPb4Hvaa	No its legal|`|VnJ8X2rkaa	no not at all.|`|7DrtPWCIaa	I don't think so.

If he is, he'll find a way to arrest you, even if you're not actually breaking Canadian Law.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	Probably not, but why would you want to?
AA10057599	i think you mean D&C, when pronounced comes out as DNC.  it refers to Drill & Ceremony (marching).|`|pf8GXvMYaa	Drill and Ceremony. Basic marching and facing movements.<br>  <br>  *One thing to remember...Never anticipate the Command in D&C.|`|VVCpJFxtaa	Do Not Call him wanting to quit. Only kidding. It is Drill and Ceremony as others have already said. Good look with your career in the military and thank you for serving.
9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	If you are military, your state (home of record) is the state you joined from. but if you earn money in another state, you must pay that state taxes.<br>  You can still vote in Texas elections|`|AA11696297	your home of record is Texas (i assume).  you maintain your citizenship in your home state while in the military.|`|AA10829482	Golden did not get the answer. . . your home of record and state of residency may or may not be the same.  <br>  <br>  For example:  I am originally from Kentucky.  This is my HOR because I joined there and established my HOR on my original enlistment documents.  (Block 4 on your DD 4/1)  This will only change if I can prove that it was initially incorrect. <br>  <br>  I get stationed in Texas and realize that I am in God's country.  I go to Finance or S-1 or whoever  and I file a form stating that I am a Texas resident.  From then on, I am a Texas resident.  As an Active Duty Member I do not pay taxes anywhere else.  As a loyal citizen in Texas I do not vote anywhere else, although I may own property elsewhere.  I also do not give up my driver's license.|`|AA10057599	i have never lived in texas and have claimed texas residency so i dont have to pay state tax.  just go down to your S-1 (personnel) and fill out the tax form.  its totally legal since you are a military member to claim residency where ever you want.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Golden got the answerer -
O4jGlC2caa	Wow.  I wouldn't have let anyone keep my car for 2 weeks let alone 4 months.  File a police report and also go to small claims court.  Good luck.  Without that receipt, you may not be able to prove anything... or it will be a he-said vs. he-said situation.  By the way, hate to break it to you, but I bet your car is looooong gone.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't press charges (I'd call the car "stolen") and sue for money owed... including the car.  Just don't expect to see your car again.  It probably went through the illegal chop shop in the back.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	small claims court.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	I've never seen ANY Eclipse that was worth $3700.|`|AA11696297	if you were wise, friend or no friend, you documented everything, got a receipt for the loan, work order/invoice for the repair work, etc.  if not you are skrewed.  at least the car is registered in your name, maybe.  then again he may have registered it in his name (called it abandoned).|`|42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	Small claims court and going to the police with a title for recovery are your only options.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Do you have title to the car? <br>  <br>  You need to track him down and take him to small claims court.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	You can go after him for your car, but the money will be harder to get back, unless you had a signed work order, proof of payment to him, and an agreement.|`|Wi31v8tmaa	You need some kind of evidence, chat logs or a witness or something. Without that there's not much you can do to prove it.|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	i wouldn't call him your friend|`|iCNTcV3baa	He was never your friend from the start . When you loan people money<br>  that get that **** called Amnesia . Like your so-called friend.<br>  <br>  You need to find and kick his *** until he gets his memory back .<br>  once you done that , and he's OK I know I owe you man . Then kick his *** again for doing you like that .<br>  <br>  As far as the Police goes they can charge him for stealing you wheels.<br>  But as far as the money thing goes . I don't think you'll have much luck in getting any of it back. I feel for man I really do. Never trust anyone .without them signing a contract for every thing The car and whats to done to the car. And the Total amount of money loan or handed to that person .

AA10010204	Occasionally, someone on YA will accidentally stumble upon a controversial issue that 'validates' them by stirring up responders and generating lots of answers to their questions, somehow hoodwinking them into thinking that the number of answers to their questions means that they have made some valuable contribution in this forum.  Unfortunately, it has happened again, with you.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what "averything" is, as referred to in your question, but I should take a moment to point out for you (since you have obviously struggled to figure it out on your own) that a substantial percentage of the so-called 'conspiracy theorists" that you refer to are quite forthcoming about their position that they do NOT claim to know what REALLY happened, only that they have some serious and VALID questions and challenges to the "official" story commissioned by the US government and disseminated by the US press.  Most of us simply want an independent, honest, and non-government-controlled investigation into the events of 9/11.<br>  <br>  One of the ironies in this situation that always makes me laugh is that the people yelling the loudest about conspiracy nuts, whackos, theorists, etc., are the same people who are too stupid to understand that if they accept the government's and media's version of the events, they TOO are conspiracy theorists, since the official version involves more than one person, thereby making the attacks an conspiracy.<br>  <br>  Just a few more points...  First, I can't, for the life of me, understand how ANYONE can watch the video of WTC7 collapse without IMMEDIATELY comparing that collapse to a video of one of the many clips they've seen of a building being intentionally demolished.  Second, I can remember on the day OF the 'attacks,' as I was watching with fascinated horror as the twin towers collapsed, thinking that it looked like those same clips of Vegas hotels being intentionally brought down via controlled demolition.  Third, I was a very staunch supporter of Bush, quietly (because it wasn't too popular to be so) and definitely didn't WANT to believe that our government could have possibly been involved in something as nefarious as perpetrating a staged attack on our own citizens in order to advance its own agenda.<br>  <br>  When faced with evidence so convincing, and being open-minded enough to objectively consider what may be the truth, one only has to be willing to accept that what is seen and obvious, no matter how hard it is to accept, is what IS.  Or, as Sherlock Holmes liked to observe, "When you remove the impossible, what remains is the truth, no matter how improbable."<br>  <br>  Am I afraid of my government?  You bet I am.  But what scares me more is that you're going to graduate (maybe) in a year or so, and have the delusion that your degree means that you're educated.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that you wake up, and smell what your government and the media has been feeding you by the shovelful.<br>  <br>  Gig 'Em.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	You have to remember, <br>  <br>  The absence of evidence, is part of the conspiracy.<br>  <br>  the Conspiracy theorist believe that the absence of evidence, proves thier conspiracy.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Maybe it was the mind control ray the CIA has on them?|`|AA12104896	Never.

48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	You folks need to go back and repeat the 8th grade.<br>  <br>  Here's a short lesson just to refresh your memories, in case you were too busy smoking cigarettes and not going to class.<br>  <br>  We have three (3) branches of governement in the USA.  The Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial.  The President is in the Executive branch - he does not draft (write) legislation; that is the job of the Legislature (House of Respresentatives and Senate).<br>  <br>  So, the monkey in the cartoon can not and does not refer to any President.  Since it is a single monkey, it is also unlikely that it refers to any one person.<br>  <br>  Haven't any of you heard of the Infinite Monkey Theorum?  It's only been around for about 100 years.

NEITHER Speaker of the House Pelosi NOR President Obama wrote the new bill.<br>  <br>  What the NY Post is saying (in my mind at least) is that the bill was so poorly written (by Congressional Staffers - Don't you dare think that our Congressmen and women would bother to stay up late and draft a piece of legislation) that they probably had a monkey do it.<br>  <br>  Dah.<br>  <br>  As for any comparisons to President Obama...please note that people had been comparing former President Geo.

Proof: Obama keeps talking about how "95% of families" get refunds but 95% of families don't all pay taxes.<br>  <br>  Even IF we get more in our paychecks, taxes will have to go up to pay for all this sh*t. I can't believe the crap they stuck in this thing.

If you get 52 paychecks per year (one per week) then that still only adds up to $364.00.  If you are already on government assistance and DO NOT work, you get almost twice that much plus the obvious added benefits.  Before long we'll have to stay home on welfare and live on food stamps to survive.  Everyone keeps saying "the poor man's day has come."  That's not true.  He's making a lot of low income and middle income families poor while the "lazy man's day" has come.  The poor man is just getting poorer.|`|k6hicodfaa	If you gave the money from the Bush tax cut it would be an equivalent number on a weekly basis.<br>  <br>  A tax cut is still considered an expenditure and one where it is not guaranteed to be spent into the economy.

Nobody has ever suggested that the 'government' redistribute anything.  The object has always been decent wages, safe working conditions, affordable health insurance, quality education and honorable retirement.  As there's no reason not to adjust any workable social and economic system to attain these ends there's no reasonable reason to oppose them.  I'm not certain why anyone would be against good wages as good wages produce a thriving middle class able to consume the products they work to create.  Good wages allow for savings, investment, profits and the tax base to provide the benefits of living in a first world country.  In a day when corporations are cutting back on employer based health insurance the only other way to provide the greatest good for the greatest number is some form of Universal Health INSURANCE.  The GOP always characterizes this as HEALTH CARE...evidently the concept of INSURANCE is beyond the grasp of some people.  Is anyone against world class education?  Safe working conditions?  Decent retirement?  Aren't those things supposed to be the benefits of living in and supporting a first world country?  As far as private charity securing access to education, honest wages, medical insurance, safe working conditions and retirement.....I dunno.....if they could do all that, they would have done it by now.  As a people we should arrange everything we do around the legitimate needs of real people.  All this ideology isn't going to do it.  The government is 'the people', and we have a 'right' to 'promote the general welfare'.  If wages, education, safety, medical insurance and retirement don't figure as 'general welfare', what does?  No kiddin'!

Bush, whether rightfully or wrongfully, was perceived as stupid so I don't think people necessarily disagreed with his policies as strongly they did his character. Consequently, I don't think Obama's will drop as low as Bush's simply because Obama comes across as oh so intelligent.  It depends.  If, for example, we are attacked, you may very well see Obama's numbers drop even lower than Bush's.

RfxyVIh4aa	No.  You do not have any rights with regard to your father unless you have a durable power of attorney for health care that he filled out.  Otherwise, the spouse is always the next of kin.  As long as he his married (even if he gets separated), your stepmother is his next of kin and has the legal authority to make any and all medical decisions on his behalf if he can't do so.<br>  <br>  You have absolutely no rights whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if he were to pass away without a will chances are pretty good you would not inherit a thing.  The spouse inherits the entire estate - and it doesn't matter if it's a second or even third marriage.|`|AA11696297	have you tried calling the local hospitals to ask if he is there?  that would seem to be the first step.|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	A child does not have more rights than a spouse.  Although the spouse might in some circumstances have more rights than the child, the spouse does not have more rights than the patient himself.<br>  <br>  If your dad is competent and conscious,  he can make his own decisions.  <br>  <br>  The question is whether your dad  wants to or is able to talk to you, not whether his wife doesn't want you to talk to him.<br>  <br>  I agree with those who suggest that you call the hospitals. Try calling other relatives or close friends of your father, or his church pastor, or his place of employment if you want to - DO NOT tell them the part about your problems with your stepmother.  Tell them that you have not been able to reach your father and that you have reason to believe that he is in the hospital.  That ought to be good enough.  <br>  <br>  So what if your stepmother gets mad?  She'll just have to deal with it, just like you have to deal with being so far away, having to call 20 hospitals, etc.<br>  <br>  Particularly if he is gravely ill then it is understandable that you will want to make arrangements to see him.  If nothing else you can send him a card.  <br>  <br>  If there is a telephone in your dad's room you can call him. <br>  <br>  If your stepmother answers and refuses to let you speak to him or if  the hospital claims privacy ask for  ask to speak to social services or a floor nurse and ask them to talk to your father and give him your contact information. (Maybe they won't do it, but no harm in asking.)  <br>  <br>  If he is  well enough to speak then he can express his wishes which will  trump his wife's wishes.  <br>  <br>  If he is NOT well enough to speak then in a compassionate situation the phone could be held to his ear so you can tell him that you love him and are thinking of him.  (Which was done for my father when he was gravely ill and my brother was across the country.)<br>  <br>  As far as durable powers of attorney or the right to make medical decisions for your father, he makes his own decisions if he is able. It is likely that he would have appointed his wife as the person to make medical decisions because you are so far away.  <br>  <br>  Don't rely on legal advice from Yahoo Answers.  For example, the advice in an earlier post (which I don't think you asked for) about inheritance rights is not correct.  If your dad has a will, then the will states who will inherit how much and what, except that property that he owns jointly (in writing) with your stepmother will go to her.  Chances are that relatively little of your father's assets are his sole, separate property, but that would be sorted out when the time comes... which we all hope is not any time soon.  <br>  <br>  If your dad disinherited you and left everything to his wife, so be it.  <br>  <br>  If he has no will then the laws of "intestate succession" apply.  Under Georgia law, if a person dies without a will the spouse does NOT inherit everything.  If there is one child, then the estate is split 50-50.  If there is more than one child then the spouse gets 1/3 and the children get equal shares of the remaining 2/3 of the estate.  <br>  <br>  Again, this only applies to property that is solely owned by your dad.  Property and accounts that are jointly owned by your father with your stepmother would be hers.  <br>  <br>  And, again, do not take my word for this.  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you go see your father please do not be suckered into a fight with your stepmother.  <br>  <br>  I am so sorry for this difficult situation.  You are having a "character-building experience."|`|uiVLNs72aa	ya definitly call family members and all local hospitals. they'll be able to tell u
AA10766729	It's *usually* 15 to 16, but in some states (those with high agricultural output) the age can be as low as 13.  The best place to start would be with your school office/counselor's office.  You will need to obtain a work permit before applying anyplace, and you get that from your school.|`|uiVLNs72aa	all states are different go to the<br>  department of labor <br>  i believe its dol.gov or just google it.<br>  they have all information on there.|`|InSi6vUTaa	16.It also depends on where you work.<br>  If its a certain profession you may need to be 18.<br>  <br>  To prevent abuses and exploitation of young people at work the basic conditions of employment for young people of school age are regulated by law. The main piece of law is the Children and Young Person's Act 1933. The legislation affects all young people of school age. A person ceases to be of school age on the school leaving date. (This is the last Friday in June). This is in the school year in which you reach 16.

5syj6Uzaaa	Yes, I do sometimes feel depressed by the apparent ignorance of answers.  Some of the mainstream opinions frustrate me as well.  For instance, you recognize the appalling ignorance of the masses but still stand up for the system whereby the mob rules.  It really is like a civic religion.  If you are like most Americans, you have been taught from a very young age that voting is a solemn duty, almost holy.  Very few people ever critically question that indoctrination.<br>  <br>  In the end, I think that we both are interested in educating the masses.  You apparently hope that people could someday become better informed (or else why would you support voting?).  I hope for a greater understanding of liberty wherein society's problems would be addressed by voluntary institutions.  Whatever your take on my ideals [1], if you are so down on the masses, can you consider that there are a lot of things that should not be decided by voting?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I know that you meant, rather, the banal ignorance that shows complete lack of depth for thought.  I expect that will always be the mode of thinking among some people.  I am more frustrated about what I deem to be ignorance in people who ought to be more capable.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Not only the ignorance, but their willingness to spew word-for-word what comes from right-wing radio and TV, and couch it as their own opinion.|`|7THgBSvfaa	OMG!!

Disappointed oh yes, but it's like everything else. People will say something stupid like: Those French Fries are cold so I hate Coke!<br>  In politics one that I find insane if nothing else is when they say that people shouldn't buy what they can't afford when it's the people in positions of responsibility who are making the loans and getting paid regardless of if the loans default or not. Nobody should get paid to make a bad loan until the loan is paid off and if it defaults they should have to pay back their commissions. Good luck with that, huh?<br>  Most of the answers I find entertaining though. Even the REALLY stupid ones make me laugh from time to time. The opposition continually digs their holes deeper and deeper with ignorance which I actually like. It'll keep them out of power for years to come if they keep it up.<br>  So people, tell us some more silly answers. I need a good laugh. ;)<br>  <br>  One thing i find depressing isn't at the federal level even though it can be depressing if you let it, but at the local level we have millions upon millions of people who don't have the first clue who their mayor is, who represents their district or even zip code. At the local level they just vote in as many utterly ignorant laws as they wish and most people vote straight down party lines with absolutely no regard for what the candidates stand for.<br>  On the fed level I'm rather liberal, but not so at the local level. There I'm very independent. Local city counsel people often move from town to town when voted out then just take the money they made and use it to suck down more in another suburb until they get caught then move along to another suburb, often in the same county. If they get caught in a Dallas suburb, no problem, just take your millions and minions and move to NY or California or Maine..or wherever and nobody even knows it or is remotely aware of it. That happens every year all across America with both parties.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Not really. I just post my opinions. If I think someone is incorrect on something I try to present an alternate opinion on the matter. I try to stay in the realm of the factual, except where the opinions being discussed are purely speculative and open to different interpretations. What I find is that many people complain about dissenting opinions, but offer little in support of their position. I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and if I see something I question then I try to do some research on the issue before responding. The sad fact is that on political boards you find that the majority of posts are penned by partisans who are unwilling to consider alternate view points from their own. This leads more often to over simplifications, finger pointing and name calling than any legitimate discussion of issues. Really you just have to write it off to the idea that everyone has opinions, but you do not have to accept the position of anyone.|`|u1bFsnCPaa	Sometimes, but I kind of expect it other times, because of stereotypical age groups on here.
