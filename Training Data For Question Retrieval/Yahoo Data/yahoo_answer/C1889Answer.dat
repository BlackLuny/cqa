I had an older laptop that acted much the same, and from that time forward I have used my antivirus, and Ccleaner as often as I can to keep my computer safe.<br>  <br>  AVG works well (and free)<br>  CCleaner is awesome (and free)<br>  <br>  Now that you have it restored I would run these programs at least once a week.<br>  <br>  Also the question of why it takes 10 times to restore a computer I think equates to why we used to hit machines with our hands, and bash them with hammers just to get them to work LOL.  With my new computer I just don't take any chances.|`|AA12117196	If you kept choosing earlier dates for restoring the system.  Then perhaps you've finally found a date before your computer was infected.  And that may be why your last restoration worked.
aeSWh73iaa	Hello;<br>  <br>  Installing Linux on a laptop is not for the faint hearted!  Sometimes it goes smooth, sometimes it is pure hell.  The problem of course is the drivers ... if the distro has the drivers then it works easy if not ... well nasty problems.   I did a check and my guess is that Linux will go on you Acer Laptop just fine.  Apperently Acer sells some Linux Laptops should you might be in luck.<br>  <br>  I recommend Ubuntu Distro ... it seems the most user friendly.  It is easy to install and use.<br>  <br>  First you have to get an installation disk.  Not that difficult to do -- you can download it off the web and then burn it disk using the ISO setting.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a> <br>  <br>  Once you get the disk you simply boot from it and it will ask questions about how you install the system (Duel Boot, or Linux System) -- The most important thing is that when it asks for the Username and Password ... you must get that right DON'T EVER FORGET the info because your machine will not run with out it.<br>  <br>  Once you get the OS installed it is a great idea to go on the net and get the updates.<br>  <br>  I don't know how wireless will work ... the newest version is supposed to have good support (version 8.10.xx Intrepid Ibex).<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  <br>  Bill|`|ce58dc2ca3f04c5917d30396a655f03aaa	I'm pretty sure Ubuntu has alot of network drivers, so i would try that. Not too sure on the OD, though. Just put a bootable copy of ubuntu on  a flash drive and stick it in, open up your BIOS and change the flashdrive as the first bootable drive and restart. Should start up, unless the copy of ubuntu is bad.

0d9b657fe19e5aa8e1634e830acde7a4aa	Does it really shut down, or just go into hibernation? If it just goes into hibernation, it is at the ready state, still consuming electricity, albeit minor. I recently read an article that stated that any plug-in device which actually has a shut off switch and you have it in the off position, is not consuming any electric. A can opener for instance, does not have an on/off switch and is therefore always consuming electricity even when not in use (if it is plugged in). Things like your cable box always consume energy even when clicked off because they remain at the ready state, waiting for a signal from your remote.

5cAIFYiOaa	What you're talking about is a Wireless Repeater. It's a piece of hardware that will take an existing wireless network, then re-broadcast it so that you can extend the range.  You can't do that with your laptop, as your wireless card won't broadcast a wifi signal.  I have, however, seen people share connections via usb, cat5 crossover cables, and other crazy methods, but that's not wireless.  If wired will do, you can look into that.|`|HVlc9ezKaa	I am THINKING you're talking about changing the SSID of the signal. You have to telnet or log into the router and change it from there. Keep in mind that anything that used to connect to that is going to have to be retold to connect to the new one as it looks based on SSID|`|iCnVDy0paa	The only way I would know how to do that is to attach another router along the lines. Say your computer picks up the wireless through a wireless adapter you could then right click the adapter in network connections and then press properties -> advanced then tick to allow the connection to be shared. You could then plug a cable router into your computers ethernet port and use your computers connection as the routers connection.

edPeEGzmaa	1) uTorrent will show you the number of seeds at any given moment. It's right on the downloading page, to the right of your download progress bar. If you have a torrent with a lot of seeds, odds are it will stay that way in the time you need to download it.<br>  2) Obviously the more you're trying to get the more bandwidth you'll be using, but it depends. If you have a good DSL or cable connection (like several MB/s) then you can easily manage several downloads at once. If you start up 5 downloads and they're all running at like 100-200kb/s on their own, then yeah you're bound to start seeing decreasing speeds as you pile more of these really fast transfers on. Your network will bog down and slow.<br>  3) Slow downloads aren't necessary your network or computer's fault. The nature of torrents is hit and miss at times, sometimes you'll get good seeds with solid connections that are nearby and offer high transfer speeds, and other times you get stuck with only a handful of seeds that are far away, have poor connections, etc. It depends on the circumstances.<br>  <br>  Sometimes firewalls and such can choke your speed, but honestly I doubt it would make much of a difference. You can try disabling firewalls as you download and see if your speed changes at all, but it's advisable to just leave it on. The best way to increase speed is to find optimal files, that is the most seeds and least leeches possible.|`|KgtI19bgaa	go to the options menu in u torrent, you can set speeds there. i recommend one at a time so you don't waste your down bandwidth on a bunch of files; it also depends on how many people seed the file; 1 by 1 is usually the quickest. you don't have to worry about seeds, seeds are added to the tracker automatically as long as the file is on que; you seed while you download and even more after you're done; everyone does. you can decrase the up speed and increase the down speed, focus on one file after the other; you should be good.|`|zb7DzohLaa	I always use Utorrent for all my torrent needs.Its safe to download more tahn one because it wont decrease the speed at all. you really dont need to check everyday since usaully ever once and a while it changes dramatically.|`|koswZl0iaa	Hey Buddy<br>  Welcome to the world of torrents<br>  <br>  Sharing IS Caring !<br>  <br>  1.There is no need to check on the number of seeds daily.<br>    >100 Mb  Minimum 50 seeds<br>    <100 Mb  Minimum 10 seeds<br>  You can also choose your own limits<br>  <br>  2.For me it works if I have two torrents downloading simultaneously. If one torrent fails to download by some odd reason the second one acts as backup.It is also important to "Queue" torrents so that they download continuosly one after another.<br>  <br>  3.There are many reasons for lesser downlading speeds.  <br>  You can find out more about utorrent settings in their forum<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forum.utorrent.com/viewforum.php?id=11" rel="nofollow">http://forum.utorrent.com/viewforum.php?...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Just a small advice.

The best thing to do is contact your router company (I didn't see a model or make in there, might have missed it) and have them walk you through securing your network. After you do that, in order for your cheap neighbors to get on your router, they would have to know a passkey that you will set. Just give your router company a call, and they can give you the specifics on how to do it. <br>  <br>  Don't fret over it though, all will be well.

b2qdwABVaa	First off, your waist function has an int z as a formal parameter (also called an argument to the function), so don't declare a variable with the same name in the function, as it will get confusing.<br>  <br>  Just change the int z variable inside your waist function to: int bonus or some other variable name.<br>  <br>  <br>  Revise the code as follows:<br>  <br>  double waist(int x, int y, int z) {<br>  double result;<br>  int bonus;<br>  <br>  if (z >= 30)<br>  bonus = (z - 30) / 10; // This line was changed<br>  result = ((x * y) + 288) + (bonus * 1.8); // This line was changed<br>  else<br>  result = ((x * y) + 288);<br>  <br>  return result;<br>  <br>  As for the user inputting negative values, you usually want to check for that immediately after reading in the input to see if you should prompt the user again for a valid value.  You pretty much had the correct idea though, integer division will neglect the remainder.  Hope that helps.

tskyJu4naa	This problem seems to come up frequently & I've just had it for the 1st time too. Michael M (on Answers 1 yr ago) said to change your import Preferences to "AAC format". That's helped some other people but didn't help me  - mine was already set to that. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you already had it there too. If not, try setting or confirming the AAC setting by going to Preferences > Advanced > Importing, then select AAC Encoder for the "import using" and be sure the "Setting" is selecting one of the standard qualities. Try to avoid using any "Custom" settings (at least for now). Maybe this will work for you.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. If you have the same problem after trying the above, maybe you could answer a few questions: <br>    1. Are you on Mac or Windows platform?<br>    2. Have you done any RECENT s/w updates (e.g. iTunes or Quicktime or any other media related s/w?)<br>    3. As a test, try the following: <br>          a. Reset your import Preferences > Advanced > Importing to select MP3 Encoding and any standard quality setting. <br>          b. Try to import a song or a CD. - Does it work?<br>          c. If so, try another of the Import setting options (e.g. AIFF, Apple Lossless, etc.) and try another song or CD.<br>          d. If these worked, try resetting to AAC with one of the standard settings. Try importing again.<br>  <br>  So far, I've successfully imported using everything EXCEPT AAC.  It was all working fine before I did some s/w upgrades yesterday which included QuickTime 7.6.  From a number of various posted comments I think QT may be involved in the problem but . . .   <br>  <br>  If you get to this point and still can't import using AAC please answer the above info, especially anything about recent s/w updates & installations. I don't have the answer yet but am only 90 minutes into it.<br>  <br>  Good luck! (and let us know if and how you fix it!)

ALNZ9Eftaa	Most definitely!  Posting your photos online is absolutely fine.  It's the information you put in your profile is what you need to be more careful of.  So, no need to cover your face.  Unless, you're trying to hide information from friends such as where you were last weekend - they'll be able to determine where you were just by looking at the surroundings/background.  So, it's really up to you - whatever makes you feel comfortable.|`|Tjtq4soEaa	yes it is safe but for all websites that you add pictures to(myspace, facebook, etc.) there will be a terms of services or something like that and if you accept they have the write to use your picture for adds and posters so cafeful on what you post|`|er08io5Aaa	for the most part it is. just don't put stupid pictures up. and put your privacy settings on highest possible.|`|Eqz8B2Emaa	all my friends have their pics on there|`|t043WEDIaa	i think as long as you put all of the top privacy settings you'll be fine|`|u18SzgJwaa	if your under 18, keep it private, other than that there is no need|`|PP8tKxYdaa	I'm under 18 and a show my pic|`|oQxmkVGhaa	your fine! but when someone starts to stalk you make it private!:)|`|9qqbY1gZaa	yeah i do all the time|`|h3rN7snkaa	Your fine|`|vN6J6nELaa	SURE IT IS!

Dose the apple logo come up? if so you can restore it by making sure its off then hold the home button down when you plug it in to the computer it will manually put your i touch in safe mode (i tunes logo with usb cable) go through i tunes process and there ya go its back in action!|`|7aqEtfLRaa	You voided the warranty when you jailbroke it, so no.|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	So sorry - that's one of the risks of jailbreaking them: you totally void all warranties and return policies.<br>  <br>  Did you try restoring it?

1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I've owned an HP for years, and it gets a lot of use.  It prints great pictures, too.  And, never 1 paper jam.|`|z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  Right now Epson is having a blowout on the 5-color R280 for $60. It even prints on DVDs.<br>  <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?oid=63069504&RMID=200903_high_inventory&RRID=1013876963" rel="nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|ogYrGjYuaa	HP  I have a Lexmark and my ink number is hard to find//////////////|`|zGkqGZzYaa	HP|`|4DSCiwWHaa	cannon|`|MxculX2Daa	Forget Canon.

You can download it for free: <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/</a> <br>  <br>  If you want to burn the vob files back to DVD you will need a DVD authoring software like Super DVD creator so you can recreate it just like the original.

Another way of saving a copy into your hard drive is by ripping the DVD movie using a DVD ripping tool like ImToo dvd ripper. By using this tool you can saved your ripped files to any format you like such as divx, mp4, avi etc. by using a ripping tool the output will be encoded into a single compress file. One great feature about ImToo ripper is that you can customize the output file size. This is a great way if you want to save hard drive space. <br>  You can then use the Super DVD Creator if you want to burn your ripped files back to DVD.

You can just copy your DVD movie into a blank DVD by using a DVD copying software like DVD next copy. During the process the software will save a temporary DVD files into your hard drive but you will have the option not to automatically delete the temporary files after the burning process is done. In this way you can save a lot of time. But just like the first option it will use up a lot of hard drive space since the files saved in your hard drive are in DVD format.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people suggest that you either install or "get" something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it's really YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" or "Flash" <br>  that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If, by the following day, YouTube is still stuck and showing<br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it'is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and can't take anymore -- the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are 1000s of tiny bits of websites<br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube and clear<br>  your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and<br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would<br>  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without <br>  having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send<br>  me a message/note with your YouTube username or email <br>  address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache" <br>  (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think<br>  of those two as you would Windows XP compared to Vista.<br>  Please consider this previous "Best Answer" of mine, then<br>  check out the Asker's comments afterwards:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that my information proves somewhat helpful for you.<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now

Only difference is that HDMI also carries audio data (up to 7.1 channels worth for surround sound)<br>  <br>  So in other words, if you're running the cable from your computer to your monitor and your monitor doesn't have speakers (or your sound system is separate from the monitor), then save money and get DVI.|`|0IWZXeL9aa	They will both produce the exact same Digital video.  If you have the option, use HDMI.  HDMI is the ONLY of the 2 that will give you both Video AND Audio!|`|YESUhp8gaa	amp9C1 v2.0 is correct, HDMI is found in a lot of modern LCD tvs too.|`|XlyLakYAaa	It really doesn't matter.  They're both digital signals.|`|3Zm9vDw1aa	HDMI is alot more expensive for the wires and connections and is a high quality but is more used in LCD tvs and high quality electronics.  dvi is more for computer graphics though for smaller but high quality graphics.  but if you only have dvi on your computer theres a plug that they make that conects the computer dvi to a tvs hdmi this is possible because they are both digital videos|`|CyJUFQCSaa	both are digital pictures, and the same quality possibilities, HDMI can carry audio and video DVI only video.|`|SJM0rzHtaa	HDMI is merely DVI-D digital video + audio all in one cable.<br>  <br>  That is why you can connect a computer's DVI port to an HDTV's HDMI port using a DVI-to-HDMI cable.  They use the absolute same digital video signal.  Which is why there is absolutely NO difference in picture quality.<br>  <br>  I'm using a DVI-to-HDMI cable to connect my computer to my 52" LCD HDTV.  Proof is in the pudding:  <a href="http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/armchairaviator/computer/IMG_0880c.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/a...</a>|`|ebuxHnScaa	I should point out that DVI can carry analog signals as well as digital signals. HDMI can only carry digital video.<br>  <br>  If you have a choice, I'd prefer HDMI because it can carry audio as well and because you are 100% sure the video is digital. But if they are both carrying digital video, they will provide identical picture quality.<br>  <br>  Adapters are available to go from one to the other. Note that the adapter will not work if the DVI port is only carrying analog video (which would be unusual unless you put a DVI adapter onto a VGA port).

Here we go:  Macs are easy and now you can get a Dual Processor that does Windows also. No other computer can make that statement. A MacBook 2.4, 4 Gigs Ram will do the trick for you. Lightweight and is a Heavyweight in performance.  With Apple Stores usually close by it's easy way to get your computer fixed if it's a minor problem. They usually do right on the spot. With Dell in particular you have to send it to them [at your cost] and wait for at least 2 weeks to get it back. Almost no one will work on a Dell so Dell's got you. If you take the time to check Dell's website everyday you will see the same model computer configured slightly different and with a different price. Deceptive to say the least. Hope this helps you make a decision no matter which computer you buy. <br>  <br>  Here's why you should get a Mac:: There are NO CONS. The MacBook does both WinBloze and OSX, no other computer can make that statement. You have the best of the best. Apple Stores are popping up all over and you can make an appointment for a time and date, bring your computer there. They will troubleshoot it and fix it if it's a software problem it's FREE. What other computer company has stores and can make that statement? Get the 2.4 GHz with 4Gigs Ram and you got a speed machine like mine. The WinBloze people may not like a Mac computer but I'll bet they all have iPods. Go Mac and Never Go Back.

AA10570173	You should be able to get it at any store that carries Apple/Mac products and software. I would call around the local computer stores (check the phonebook, they will often say they are "an Apple Authorized Dealer" but even some bookstores that carry software will have it. By any chance do you have a Fry's Electronics near where you live? (I know they're not all over the country.) They should have it. But your best bet is to look up computer stores in the phonebook (or on line for your area) and call and ask.

SNZ88BfKaa	Your getArticleInfo() function does not return any value. The line "return data;" returns the data variable from the inline function to the void, because the getArticleInfo() function returns before the ajax call returns (unless you're calling synchronously).

2vL8wOHZaa	Yes those temps are way to high. Your heat sink and fan are not installed right. Remove the heat sink and fan clean off the thermal paste with rubbing alcohol and place just a spot of new thermal paste about the size of a grain of rice in the center of the CPU and reinstall the heat sink.Make sure that you hear all four of the push pin clips. Even under the load of prime95 those temps are to high. Your CPU shouldn't see over 55-60 c under load.|`|ZJCoUMijaa	Holy sh*t...<br>  <br>  Yeah those temps are pretty darn high.<br>  Reseat the heatsink and make sure you're using enough thermal compound but not TOO much..

Also if your case has inadequate airflow it would case heating problems as well.|`|7nimzIDsaa	This is a very bad temperature i believe the highest for a Q6600 is around the 60 degrees region probably 65 max.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you set your bios configuration to default, probably you have up your voltage too much.|`|AA11439306	70's with a zalman heatsink?

QUQY3HQYaa	If i were you i would go with the cheapest case you can find. Go with a ATI radeon 4870 a intel core i7 920 a Gigabit X58 board a 700W powersupply a Thermaltake V1 cooler 6gb's of Corsair DDR3 trichannel ram and any 1680*1050 monitor you choose. This will ring you up for around 1300 maybe a little more. You have play with the price points a little by chosing 3 or 6gb's of ram and wethere you want a heatsink.|`|XlyLakYAaa	With a budget like that, I'd recommend against a GTX295.  A GTX260 would be a much wiser choice.  THen you can either go for a high-end Intel Quad-Core, or a low-end i7.  The i7 would be faster, but more expensive, but definitely doable on that budget.

The recommended amount of RAM for games nowadays should be 4 GB, but the graphic card and hard drive space is definitely good enough for the newest games.|`|WHPRFFsKaa	ok, i would go with a dual core 2.4ghz or faster (quad core or triple core is even better)<br>  then i would try to get at least 2GB or RAM 3.5 at the most unless you have windows 64bit (if you dont know whether you have it or not you have 32bit, if you had 64bit you would know)<br>  for hard drives, i would say a fast smaller hard drive to hold windows and then a fast bigger drive to hold the games and apps, this way windows and games can load and do things at the same time without slowing down<br>  for video card i would say get a ATI Radion 4830, the 9800 is the same price but slower and is outperformed by the 4830.<br>  <br>   i recomend <br>  2.6ghz dual core or better cpu<br>  2GB of RAM and up (windows 32bit max is 3.5 and win 64bit can hold 32GB and up.<br>  hdds the faster the better, size dosnt matter<br>  Video ATI 4830<br>  <br>  you will need a power supply, DONT CUT COST ON POWER SUPPLIES<br>  anything less than 55$ on a psu will probebly crap on you.<br>  <br>  for the motherboard, ausus is a good brand. just reasurch what you want befor you buy to see a products pros and cons<br>  <br>  that makes a killer pc and is cheep, remember, building your own pc is cheeper than buying retail, my pc is custom made and out performse dells pcs that are 400$ more.<br>  <br>  my setup is this and i am happy with it<br>  CPU AMD Athlon 2.6Ghz Overclocked at 3.0ghz<br>  3GB or RAM at 800mhz<br>  160GB drive<br>  500GB drive<br>  Video ATI 4830<br>  530W PSU<br>  ECS GF8200a Motherboard|`|7pAXElgSaa	not too bad but i would get at least another stick of RAM. A single core Pentium is a bit "old hat" but if your mother board cant take a dual core the single core will do. the 9800 isnt bad but most gamers are going for the 9800GTX+ or faster. again, check if your mother board can handle it...and your pocket book!|`|7aqEtfLRaa	The hard drive is good, and the GPU is probably good, but seriously, pentium 3 (or 4, couldn't tell)? 1GB RAM? It's not going to run anything new and intense well, if at all.|`|AA11439306	Pentium 3.4?? Don't understand but if it is a single core then you have to upgrade to a dual core or quad core chip (preferably Intel) and definitely more than a gig of ram.  No matter what speed you should have at least 2.5GB in order to run games effectively.  Vista needs 3GB minimum though.|`|crYfZTo0aa	You have very good configuration!<br>  But you didnt specify about your processor.<br>  If you are running dual core and its above processors, then you just increase the size of your RAM.<br>  You can do this for upto 2GB|`|JS9CKj3waa	i suggest <br>    Intel pentium dual core 2.2ghz<br>    2Gb ram<br>    G-Force 9800GT video card 512 ddr3<br>  500gb segate of 32mb cache memory <br>  and motherboard should be 630i xfx <br>  <br>                        go gaming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|EJDKjLwQaa	hmm... a intel core 2 quad motherboard.... 4 gb of ram...... the hard drive's fine, i think.....maybe a nvidia quadro graphics card w/512 mb memory. that'll come 2 about 3-400 something bucks. but that will be a mean beast.|`|wxsB4w0daa	Try for 2 to 4 gigs of RAM these days.

WEP is really easy to crack (it's been compared to putting your info in a manila envelope for protection). Use WPA if you can.|`|4f58b741f1cf1cc5db2e40277aebc2c8aa	You can easily change your WEP key by going into your router's page. The address(es) for your router could be:<br>  192.168.2.1<br>  192.168.1.1 (Mostly for Linksys devices and hacked DD-WRT routers)<br>  192.168.0.1 (D-Links, Netgears, etc)<br>  <br>  In your router's Wireless page, there should be the option of entering, clearing or even changing the WEP key. Or for more added fun, you can use WPA2 or WPA instead of WEP (WPA/WPA2 is far more secure than WEP, but it can be hacked though...)<br>  <br>  To prevent this in the future you may want to consider on physically powering off your router when you are not using the Internet or if your Cable modem does have a standby switch, use it. If you are like me and need Wireless Internet 24/7, you might want to consider using WPA Enterprise. WPA Enterprise is much, much, much more secure but that is out of the scope of what we're trying to solve and can be frustrating for first time users to learn how to deploy such systems on their own network.|`|fRTmQlFQaa	change your passkey buddy <br>  ;)

rHqe7oMoaa	Be WARY of the "buy it now 99c" listings. These are usually scammers, OR they make their profits in postage charges. ie. item costs 99c but postage is hundreds of dollars. It's a way for them to avoid paying high Final value fees to eBay.  I will not buy 99c listings because of this. Make sure everything (postage and handling, fees, return policy etc..) are all listed on the page before you buy. If they aren't make sure to clarify everything by "email this seller a question" BEFORE buying.<br>  <br>  Some general tips to avoid being scammed:<br>  <br>  1. Be wary of low (or 0) feedback users.<br>  2. Check their history. If this is their first time selling such items, be wary.<br>  3. Check their feedback. It can be very revealing.<br>  4. Check their past selling history and what they're currently selling. ie. if they suddenly list a lot of 'desirable' electronics/tech items, then this can be an indication that the account has been hijacked.<br>  5. If they have bad English in their listing, this can be indicative of a scammer.<br>  6. If they have an email address listed on the auction page this is 100% a scammer.<br>  7. If they ask you to email them on their auction page to do the sale off eBay RUN.<br>  8. Be wary if the listing does not have much information.<br>  9. Ask SPECIFIC questions - even ask questions you KNOW the answer to - to test the seller. If they don't have the phone (or haven't sold a real one) then they're bound to get this wrong.<br>  10. Do they use their own images or do they use stock photos? This is not always an indication, but can help with a circumstantial case.<br>  11. Check out their selling history and pay attention to the buyers. Some scammers will create fake account (low f/b usually) and 'buy' their own items in order to gain (fake) reputation as a reliable seller.|`|OPrgBGAjaa	the buy it now usually mean it is information and it will be sent to your email don't bother with them there is a high possibility that the email will have a virus in them don't buy anything that does not have a picture you don't now what condition the item is or if you are getting what you are paying for look at the feed back that will tell you information from other people that have bought anything from this person try and deal with somebody with high score feed back like stay away from people that has less than 10 other than that trust your Instinct if you have a feeling that something ain't right stay well clear|`|VeLhLlulaa	Buy it now means you agree to pay the price asked and not bid for the item you want. I have used this and had no problems with it. It,s "VERY" important to have a Pay Pay account when you use e-bay. This gives you protection up to 1000 pounds. and will sort out problems for damaged goods .|`|VhWll8Vjaa	I suggest any new users to eBay (even regular users), when thinking of purchasing something froma  buyer, to check their feedback. If all seems well there, then they must be a trustworthy seller. <br>  <br>  By reading their feedback, positive, negative and neutral... you'll soon know whether they are dodgy or not.<br>  <br>  I would also be careful with new sellers, who have 0 feedback, or have been on eBay less than a month. I know we all have to start somewhere, but just be careful.<br>  <br>  I also recommend paying for anything through PayPal, as you are covered if something was to go wrong.|`|583ff46a929130f3c37248e696cedbabaa	read this book for  further information: ebay for dummies

Containing information and settings for all the hardware, software, users, and preferences of your computer, whenever you make a change to the Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes are reflected and stored in the registry. The Windows operating system<br>  <br>  continually references this information during its operation.<br>  <br>  When the Windows registry becomes very large, your computer’s can become very slow and it can cause it to be unstable. Some computer users will spend a lot of time and effort going through the registry and trying to fix the slow computer manually. Not only can this be a daunting and frustrating task, it is also a very risky one.<br>  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!<br>  <br>  Clean your Registry can make your computer faster<br>  Most computer users find this task confusing and time consuming and those who are not advanced computer experts run the risk of permanently damaging their system by trying to fix their windows registry manually.

I bet you have asked yourself that very question time and time again. And for the most part, you probably just can not figure it out. Ask the guy next to you, and they probably don’t have the foggiest idea either. I mean, you may get the “spyware,virus” answer, but this most likely is not the case.<br>  <br>  The first place I check when my computer starts to run slower is the registry. Yes, the registry. Most people don’t even know what, or where the registry is, and especially don’t understand how this can slow a computer down. Let me explain.<br>  <br>  Basically, the registry files contain information and settings for all of the software, hardware, operating system software, and anything else running on your computer. Mess any of these files up, and the computer does not know how to function. The computer goes to start up the software, looks for the registry files, and either can not find it or finds something that does not look like it is suppose to look like. It then just sits there: it does not know what to do next. This is where the “hanging” or “locking up” of your computer comes from. These files will need to be fixed.<br>  <br>  To fix the registry files, find a good quality registry repair software called registry cleaner and run it on your computer.Top 5 registry cleaners can be found in here: <br>  <a href="http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com/</a> .It will tell you how many files are corrupted and need to be fixed. Just tell the software to fix it and it restores all of the registry files to their correct configuration. It is really that simple. It may take only about 5 minutes to perform this check. And then as a maintenance item for your computer, I would recommend performing this registry fix at least once a week. This will always ensure your registry files are good, and keep your computer running with no slow,freezing and errors. So if you find yourself asking why is my computer slow, I would check the registry files first.<br>  <br>  Now you can check out<br>  <a href="http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com/</a> ,there are reviews of top rated registry cleaners and a clear guide to tell you how to speed up your computer.And from there you also can get a free scan to fix any problems such as computers slow,computer freezing, computer errors and getting the blue death screen.<br>  Hope that can help you.

Yes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can do it by resetting your dsl modem, routers and everything to get a new ip address then make sure the program is COMPLETELY installed.. registry keys and all.<br>  <br>  If the program has an installer (google it)  Use that for sure.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work.. you can reinstall windows and that is for sure to work as long as you use a new email and registration.<br>  <br>  Most of the time there are better alternatives you can go with and dump the old program and get one that does the same thing.<br>  <br>  Renewing trials will just waste your time.

Its just terrible and that's all.|`|SNZ88BfKaa	You have some pretty screwy HTML there. You just need to go through it and fix the weird stuff you have. For example, you have a UL tag that doesn't do anything near the top. That may cause problems. I don't really understand why you have such a large negative top margin, if your design is good that shouldn't be necessary. You have self-closed paragraph tags, which makes no sense at all. <br>  <br>  I recommend learning how to make a proper two column layout using CSS. This involves nested divs and floating elements, not insane margins.

hypshYJcaa	You can set the LIMIT part of you sql query. It might look something like this, though I don't know the exact layout of your table:<br>  <br>  SELECT * FROM `post` LIMIT 20,10<br>  <br>  This would select articles starting AFTER, so not including, the 20th returned rows for 10 rows. So for the first page you'd do SELECT * FROM `post` LIMIT 10 and then the second page: SELECT * FROM `post LIMIT 10,10 and so on.<br>  <br>  You may just want to add a GET value to the page and do (if you're using PHP):<br>  <br>  $query = "SELECT * FROM `post` LIMIT ".($_GET['page']-1)*10.", 10";<br>  <br>  This would let you put in page 1, 2,3 in the page like: posts.php?page=2 and it would display the corresponding posts.<br>  <br>  That should work and hope that helps!|`|SNZ88BfKaa	Use the LIMIT function of MySQL.

More cost efficient printing on the black and white by far.|`|kSyiUxYSaa	If the file is text, the printer only uses the black, no color involved unless the font color is set to anything other than black. My printer lets me run with the color cartridge empty which is fine by me, saves a lot of money in ink. Not sure about toner type printers though.<br>  <br>  Plus I have all my settings set to low for minimum ink usage. Go into the control panel on the start menu and click printers then right click the printer and look for ink settings and set the drying time to low or lower than it is now and lower the contrast and whatever other settings you find for ink usage. <br>  <br>  Not all printers have the same check boxes and all that so yours may both be different than I described.

DjR6rKuUaa	hi<br>  <br>  MSN Messenger Error Code - 81000314<br>  The Symptoms you get<br>  When you launch MSN Messenger and try to logon, you get an error message 81000314.  A wild guess, there is a problem with the MSN Server.<br>  The Cause of Code 81000314<br>  The Microsoft MSN server is down or otherwise unavailable.  If it is indeed Microsoft's MSN problem, then be careful not to make matters worse, for example don't try mending something that does not need mending and thus breaking a perfectly good system. <br>  Another possibility is that Softpub.dll may have become unregistered.  <br>  Solutions to MSN Error Code 81000314<br>  1) Wait for the MSN Server to return!  Meanwhile check the status of the Messenger service, at: <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx</a><br>  2) Delete ListCache.dat<br>  Launch CMD and navigate to %appdata%\microsoft.<br>  CD %appdata%\microsoft<br>  Dir /s ListCache.dat <br>  Decide if you want to delete the cache.<br>  Del /s ListCache.dat <br>  Restart your MSN Messenger. <br>  3) Register softpub.dll.<br>  Click Start (Button), and then click Run, type regsvr32 softpub.dll.  Restart MSN Messenger.<br>  It would do no harm to also use regsvr32 to re-register: wintrust.dll and initpki.dll<br>  4) Another problem could be firewall related, thus try temporarily disabling the firewall.  If this cures the problem, make sure that MSN Messenger is allowed full access through the firewall.<br>  <br>  <br>  ->>Summary of MSN Error Code 81000314<br>  If you are suffering from MSN Error Code 81000314, check that the server is available at Microsoft's end. at: <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx." rel="nofollow">http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx.</a>  Beware of doing anything to make the problem worse, when it could be the servers fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  ????????*`?. ? ??ρε ? ?εlρε??.?* ????????<br>  ☆   <br>  ::: (\(\ <br>  *: (=' :') :* <br>  ?..

This normally won't take longer then a few minutes/hours. For more information you can check the .NET Messenger Service Status<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please note that the Service Status is known to not always be very accurate, if problems do appear the best thing to do is wait them out. Surely there are many other very interesting things to do. If the error keeps bothering you for over a few days there are some more things you can try below.<br>  <br>  If the error continues to appear it is most likely because the Windows digital signatures system is damaged or corrupt. To resolve this you will have to register several dll files that are required for Messenger. You can do this automatically by running a batch file we created or if you prefer by executing the commands yourself.<br>  Automatic solution<br>  <br>  First you will have to download this zip file which includes a batch file that can register the dll files for you. After downloading unzip it and run register-messenger-dll-files.bat, a black screen will pop up and update you on the process. When done your Messenger should work again!<br>  Manual solution<br>  <br>  First open a run window by clicking start, then run. Now, type the following command and press enter:<br>  <br>  regsvr32 softpub.dll Wintrust.dll Initpki.dll Rsaenh.dll Mssip32.dll Cryptdlg.dll<br>  <br>  If you use Windows XP you should open another run window after running the previous commands then type the following command:<br>  <br>  regsvr32 Dssenh.dll Gpkcsp.dll Slbcsp.dll Sccbase.dll|`|cFF8PAP2aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  I am having the same problem, its just something with the servers with too many people logging in or something. Nothing is wrong with your computer or ur msn, its just temporarily un-avalible, the only thing best to do is be patient and wait. Doing anything else can damage MSN and make a more serious problem. My other friend's account is fine...just something in the servers. Then again Are you using DSL connections?|`|xCsHXzroaa	that exact same problem is happening to me right now too, and by the looks of it, a lot of other people as well.<br>  <br>  my guess is that they're updating the servers and it should be back in about an hour or two? i got booted off around an hour and a half ago and ive tried to get on every other way imaginable - no can do though. i'd just wait it out, and it should be better by morning.

They finally admitted it was part of the install process but couldn't tell me what it was for. Every time that I asked why messages were being removed from the Forum, I got transferred to someone else. I started at Tech Support talking to Ella, then got transferred to Sam in the Virus Removal Dept. I asked him the same questions, then finally I asked to speak to a Supervisor, and got Frank the floor supervisor. He said that it was not a virus but a "System File Issue" and he would have to transfer me to Technical Support. I then spoke to Fahed and asked the same questions. After a while he came back and explained that the system puts out updates every hour and this was part of that process. I asked again why messages about this issue were being deleted from the Norton Forum. While I was on hold, I posted myself to the Norton Forum so see what would happen (see above for that information). My question was again ignored and he then wanted to enter my computer remotely and look for viruses. I said that my question has still not been answered and I feel that something very suspicious was going on with Symantec. I told him that I was not going to allow anyone from Symantec to access my computer because I have lost my trust in the company because of the way I am being treated. I told him that I was finished with the call and would just contact the media and hung up. He called right back and told me he wanted to transfer me to his Supervisor since I was obviously not satisfied with my call. I next spoke to Austin, Case Manager. He basically repeated the same crap as everyone else and would not tell me why my post and others were deleted. I told him that I am done with Norton products and will remove them from all of my computers and others that I have installed their product on. This is crazy! Lets get the word out there! Symantec is digging a big hole with this issue and losing customer trust! What exactly are they trying to install on our systems?|`|vEk9296xaa	Wow, ok there is definitely something going on here.

759b3285555f45c7f63ca48ef2928a6caa	Very High Speed Integrated Circuit<br>  Hardware <br>  Description <br>  Language|`|AA12168381	VHSIC Hardware Description Language|`|d9df9e77f013e131e15f59d5803053edaa	VHDL or VHSIC Hardware Description Language, is commonly used as a design-entry language for field-programmable gate arrays and application-specific integrated circuits in electronic design automation of digital circuits.<br>  <br>  VHDL was originally developed at the behest of the US Department of Defense in order to document the behavior of the ASICs that supplier companies were including in equipment. That is to say, VHDL was developed as an alternative to huge, complex manuals which were subject to implementation-specific details.<br>  <br>  The idea of being able to simulate these "documents" was so obviously attractive that logic simulators were developed that could read the VHDL files. The next step was the development of logic synthesis tools that read the VHDL, and output a definition of the physical implementation of the circuit. Modern synthesis tools can extract RAM, counter, and arithmetic blocks out of the code, and implement them according to what the user specifies. Thus, the same VHDL code could be synthesized differently for lowest cost, highest power efficiency, highest speed, or other requirements.<br>  <br>  VHDL has a syntax that is essentially a subset of the Ada programming language, along with an added set of constructs to handle the parallelism inherent in hardware designs. VHDL is strongly-typed and case insensitive<br>  <br>  VHDL is a fairly general-purpose programming language, although it requires a simulator on which to run the code. It can read and write files on the host computer, so a VHDL program can be written that generates another VHDL program to be incorporated in the design being developed. Because of this general-purpose nature, it is possible to use VHDL to write a testbench that verifies the functionality of the design using files on the host computer to define stimuli, interacts with the user, and compares results with those expected. This is similar to the capabilities of the Verilog language. VHDL is a strongly typed language, and as a result is considered by some to be superior to Verilog. In fact there has always been quite an intense debate which amounts to a holy war amongst developers over which is the superior language. However, both languages make it easy for the unwary and inexperienced to produce code that simulates successfully, but that cannot be synthesized into a real device, or else is too large to be practicable. A particular pitfall in both languages is the accidental production of transparent latches rather than D-type flip-flops as storage elements.<br>  <br>   Good Luck!|`|AA12245237	Vaginal Hyper Disorder Location

992faded542788295c3255de79889537aa	The Acer travelmates are higher quality, because they are designed for traveling, which is more stressful than just sitting on your desk.  My wife has had an Aspire for over a year, and we haven't had a single problem.  Ignore people saying "don't buy something without a CD!" (Besides, I think the travelmates come with a cd) When you first boot up your Acer, it will have you burn a backup of your laptop to Cds.  Furthermore, you can repeat that process ANYTIME you wish.  Dell and toshiba do not offer comparable backup solutions standard.  Also, Dell has over the past 5 years, had one of the highest rate of defective laptops within the first 2 years of purchase.  The percentages have ranged from 15% all the way to 33% of their laptops needed service within the first two years.  So if you want to be one out of 3 people that need service on their laptops, buy a dell.  I know 3 people besides my wife with Acer laptops, and they are all problem free.  I can't say the same for anyone I know with dells.  If you want reliability, buy a thinkpad, or fujitsu.  They have the lowest levels of service required, and they feel solid.  <br>  <br>  More food for thought... Most laptops are manufactured by one of only about 5-6 companys.  Unless things have changed since last time I looked, toshiba, sony, dell, and pretty much all the smaller names outsource the manufacturing of laptops.  Lenovo (makers of thinkpads) make thier own, and I'm pretty sure HP makes their own (although they aren't that great.  The ones at work are always having optical drive, ram slot, and fan failures).  Good luck with your purchase!|`|15c1823e5e9b48351b5320ac43ae969daa	acer is totally bad item in the laptop so i suggest u to donot purchase any item which is touch acer coz they didnot give you the original windows os cd... i think you should check hp/compaq or sony vaio with windows vista.... i am talking all these coz i am tha emploeer who is channel partner of acer .................. so its advise that donot take risk to purchase the acer|`|AA10819724	I am using acer travelmate since one year , and I till now I have not encountered any problem.<br>  <br>  So according to me acer travelmate is better|`|a177f258cc3ab2b9957275c699429fcaaa	they're both ok.

But media in Europe and elsewhere were soon revolutionized by yet another invention --  wireless, which later evolved into radio, and then television. <br>  THE INVENTOR OF THE WIRELESS IS KNOW AS Guglielmo Marconi, who was was born at Bologna, Italy, in 1874. Even as a boy he took a keen interest in physical and electrical science and in 1895 he began laboratory experiments at his father's country estate where he succeeded in sending wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles, thus becoming the inventor of the first practical system of wireless telegraphy.  Wireless telegraphy did not involve transmitting speech or music. <br>  Marconi's system transmitted information using much the same code as that used by Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph. Telegraph messages were sent by tapping out a special code for each letter of the message with a telegraph key. The telegraph changed the dots and dashes of this code into electrical impulses and transmitted them over telegraph wires. A telegraph receiver on the other end of the wire converted the electrical impulses to dots and dashes on a paper tape. Marconi's invention replaced the wires and undersea cables with radio waves. It was particularly useful for communicating between ships and land bases, or between ships at sea.  It was called wireless because it was essentially a telegraph system using radio waves instead of wires to connect sender and receiver. <br>  By that time the telegraph had linked many parts of the world, either overland or undersea, but their signals had to be carried though cables or wires.   These signals traveled from point to point -- from one end of the cable to the other and back.  This was a particular problem for ships at sea that needed to communicate with each other or with shore stations. Before the invention of wireless, communication at sea was limited to visual range, using flag and light signals, or to just plain getting close enough to yell at another vessel. <br>  The navies of the world seemed an obvious sponsor, for Marconi's new invention. Marconi first tried tried to interest the  navy in his own country, Italy, in the invention. But Italy declined to support his work, and in 1896 Marconi took his apparatus to England. At the time Britain had the world's largest empire, and to service it and guard it, it had the largest navy. He demonstrated his system successfully in London and across the Bristol Channel. The British government was indeed interested, and granted Marconi the world's first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy.|`|zEvV51iCaa	Al Gore of coarse!

FBQZ06vraa	You might be confusing two or more things here.  First, to me a "registry key" is something you'd add to the Windows registry.  Not likely; people shouldn't be entering things into the Registry.  That's hazardous to the health of Windows.<br>  <br>  The second possibility was an unlock key, a long string of gibberish only the program you're unlocking knows how to digest.  Not having one of these sounds like your friend really passed their disk on to you but didn't give you the key.  If this is true, technically, yours is an illegal copy even if it's the original disk.<br>  <br>  But then you mention a USB key or a parallel key.  This makes me think of a dongle:  a little device that you attach to your computer that the software looks for as validation that it's OK to run.  If you don't have this one, give the "gift" back to your friend, who's probably laughing their head off right now at their little joke.

Yo tengo XP y desde inicio he tenido el Software de AOL.<br>  <br>  Jamás se me ha arruinado. <br>  <br>  Al Ingeniero que me arregla la máquina (Que me ha puesto aditamentos de hardware nuevos, que le da el servicio, etc.) No le gusta que lo tenga. Siempre me dice que lo quite, que es muy latoso.<br>  <br>  Pero como siempre le digo que a mí lata no me da, ni me ha dado, pues ya ni protesta.<br>  <br>  Efectivamente siempre me dice que el software puede arruinar mi Windows. <br>  <br>  Pero... no es que no le crea, le tengo confianza y por eso llevo con él mi máquina... Más nunca me ha ocurrido.<br>  <br>  Si el software ya se encuentra previamente instalado en tu computadora, significa que el fabricante hizo las pruebas necesarias. Y si te lo llegara a "arruinar", me imagino que tendrás alguna garantía.<br>  <br>  La versión actual del AOL es muy estable. (Antes si se caía más y había que reinstalarlo, pero no el Windows, hablo del AOL mismo)<br>  <br>  Y contiene varias aplicaciones que al contrario, te ayudan a cuidar de tu máquina.<br>  <br>  Así que... ?úsalo! El navegador me parece bueno. El servicio del correo electrónico, pues si es un poquito "arcáico" en cuanto a funcionalidades, pero no es malo. Simplemente más tedioso que otros. Y aún así lo puedes configurar para usarlos en el Outlook si no quieres usar su software.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a conexión telefónica a internet, mucho tiempo fué de las más estables (Hace tiempo ?Muchos a?os! que no uso esta conexión a internet, pero en su momento ?No tiraba tanto! Así que la consideraba muy buena.)<br>  <br>  Hoy día utilizo el software de AOL con mi conexión de banda ancha.  :-D Lo puedes hacer. No diario, lo confieso. Pero mi a mi hermana le gusta más ese navegador que el Internet Explorer.<br>  <br>  Es decir, de que se usa, se usa. :-D<br>   <br>  <br>  En resumen, si fuera mi máquina yo si lo usaría. No veo porque no usarlo, si es bueno.<br>  <br>  ?Saludos!

pEm5Xcxraa	A Browser Helper Object (BHO) is a DLL module designed as a plugin for Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser to provide added functionality. BHOs were introduced in October 1997 with the release of version 4 of Internet Explorer. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer. However, in the case of the Windows File Explorer, a new instance is launched for each window.<br>  <br>  Some modules enable the display of different file formats not ordinarily interpretable by the browser. The Adobe Acrobat plugin that allows Internet Explorer users to read PDF files within their browser is a BHO.<br>  <br>  Other modules add toolbars to Internet Explorer, such as the Alexa Toolbar that provides a list of web sites related to the one you are currently browsing, or the Google Toolbar that adds a toolbar with a Google search box to the browser user interface.<br>  <br>  .....read more.......|`|7FTUlD8Gaa	if its only popping up on one certain web site its probably spyware. but browser helpers serve multiple purposes they are usually active x controls to make a program function, such as an online virus scan.

In such cases the only way to remove the infection is to delete the infected file. When you moved the file to the AVG Virus Vault it was deleted from its original location, coded, and then saved in a non-executable file in a hidden folder. Your PC is no longer infected.<br>  If you are not missing any data file and your applications are running, then you can delete these vaulted files from the AVG Virus Vault program. You can do it selectively: - from the AVG Virus Vault program -> select files -> delete. Or you can delete all AVG Virus Vault contents in one go: - Open the AVG Control Center program -> right click on "AVG Virus Vault" tab -> choose "Empty vault".<br>  Note that files removed from your e-mails are also moved to the AVG Virus Vault. If you do not have a content filter set, then these files are infected and can be removed, as shown above. If you have set a content filter, then you should decide what to do with the vaulted files.<br>  If you want, you can set automatic actions in the AVG Virus Vault. Please open the AVG Virus Vault program -> "Service" menu -> "Program setting". Here you can set any required automatic actions.|`|9c93bfd6fdcaa2231fe832dc19a35a66aa	boot from windows cd and run a repair install<br>  <a href="http://mypchelp.blogspot.com/2006/10/windows-reinstallation.html" rel="nofollow">http://mypchelp.blogspot.com/2006/10/win...</a>|`|4ydHtYnJaa	I have a better solution.Uninstall the AVG free edition(very weak antivirus software) and install the new antivirus.I suggest whether   using Kaspersky Internet Security 6.0 or Avast antivirus.Rescan your computer.For full maintainance install Ccleaner(www.ccleaner.com) and TuneUp Ultities 2006/2007.This two software will keep your computer maintain good|`|ce58dc2ca3f04c5917d30396a655f03aaa	well, sorry mate but you will have to reformat. look around for your computer CDs, there should be a reformat disc that came with your computer. if you don't have it. see if you know anyone who works in computers to get you a copy of one for your computer. good luck

1af9c110f29a5ad7c253773cd58cf982aa	Depends on the application.  Most systems only support 100MB which is faster than any ISP you're likely using.  So unless you are talking to a local system that is going to crank tons of traffic at you, this is plenty of bandwidth.<br>  <br>  Gig-E is becoming more common, but a switch with Gig-E interfaces is a lot more expensive than a standard 10/100MB switch.  They both use the same physical interface, but Gig-E requires Category-6 cables, 100 MB require Cat-5 cable.<br>  <br>  10G is still super expensive and not available on many computer systems or switches yet.  Really the only negatives for the faster Ethernet standards is that they are largely overkill (unless you are hosting a LAN party) and they cost a lot more.

pTO3S2WJaa	Anyone with a computer and scanner can design a fake picture. Fake pictures are used for a variety of purposes. Those who are creating fake identification cards, passports, and driver's licenses use fake pictures. Several templates are available that allow computer savvy people to create and design an assortment of fake documents. In most cases, those who experiment with fake pictures do so for fun. This is common among young adults and children who are bored. However, some people design fake pictures with the sole purpose of deceiving others.<br>  <br>  A common technique used for creating fake pictures is taking a snapshot of someone's head, and placing it on another person's body. If you were to perform an online search for a celebrity, you will likely encounter several websites advertising nude pictures of this particular person. In almost every case, these are fake pictures. They are likely posted by teenagers with too much time on their hand. These individuals usually select photos of nude women from other websites or publications. Using sophisticated computer programs, they are able to perfectly place a celebrities head on a nude body.<br>  <br>  Fake pictures are also great for amusement. Morphing software is necessary when creating fake pictures for practical jokes. For instance, a couple could design a fake picture portraying how their future child may look. This is accomplished by taking a photo of the male and female, and morphing their features. In most cases, the child depicted in the fake picture is very unattractive.<br>  <br>  Fake pictures may also illustrate a unique background. The person in the photo could appear to be climbing a mountain, floating in the clouds, surfing, and so forth. These fake pictures are created by having the person pose on a regular background. Once the photo is developed, the picture is carefully blended onto a fake background to appear natural.|`|qNvPOWymaa	Via editing found pornographic pictures using Photoshop or a similar photo manipulation program.|`|AA12317718	by doing morphing<br>  normally with the use of photoshop|`|30ea734709691d40a7d8f4ee3cd3451baa	Photoshop, Illustrator, and sometimes Painter IX.  Most pictures throughout the general media especially those in Magazines, such as FHM, Mens Health and GQ are aestetically modified to be more pleasing to consumers.  It is interesting to note that most of these changes are psychologically in nature, such as the evening of skin tones and enlargening of the models' irisses.<br>  <br>  This promotes a sense of attraction and likeability from the general public and has been known to increase sales.

If you're using Windows XP, then you can go to Start-->Run-->msconfig and go to the startup tab and uncheck things you don't want to have load on start up (though, be careful to not get rid of important system functions...make sure you know what you're stopping)<br>  There's also a folder that should be in your program files named  "Startup" that lists files that will load on start up.

2c48b3bd7e6ca9cfd29d601e87ea4eedaa	Well, first off, are you trying to format your main Hard Drive that Windows is installed on while you are actually running Windows (usually the C: Drive)?  If so, you cannot do that.  You have to restart your computer with a restore disc or install disc in your CD Drive, because it has to boot from the CD.  Once you do that, then you can format your Hard Drive.|`|AA11393947	acer...have a master package...which does what u want...<br>  <br>  since it doesnt allow any os...windows acn do it....<br>  <br>  u need the package...<br>  <br>  else..<br>  <br>  try using linux and remove all partions|`|f52e9a9618cb79e06181a1dde2d15a33aa	acer aspire has a option to Restore to Factory Settings without recovery CD's.<br>  <br>  This is a quote from my Acer Aspire User's Guide.<br>  <br>  To start the recovery process:<br>  1.

If that doesn't help, then you need to ensure that you have the right drivers installed for your sound card:<br>  <br>  You need to find out what sound card you have and download the driver. It is not Windows that needs installing but the little driver that makes your sound card work. First find out what sound card you have, maybe it will tell you in you computer's manual. Or you can find out by doing this:<br>  <br>  You should look to see the make of your sound card and get the drivers for it from their website. To find out more info on the sound card you have installed:<br>  <br>  Click on: Start button -> All programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> System information -> Components -> Sound device<br>  <br>  You should find something in there. Or, you could try checking Device Manager. Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager and having a look in there.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you should have a "drivers" cd that came with your computer, and the driver should be on there. If you put the cd in. Go to "Control Panel" and click "System" then go into the "device manager" navigate to your audio, right click on it and choose to update driver. And get it to search for one on the cd, or the internet.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|H5s6EpkGaa	May be u have switched on the mute option check out at the taskbar if your volume icon is crossed,then thats the reason.If you dont have a volume icon,then may be the sound driver is not properly installed.Check out and tell whats the problem specifically?let me tell you the suggestion then<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freeearnings.uni.cc" rel="nofollow">http://freeearnings.uni.cc</a><br>  <a href="http://pagereviews.uni.cc" rel="nofollow">http://pagereviews.uni.cc</a>

There is no such functionality in the specifications for CD-ROMs.<br>  <br>  What you can do is protect the content *on* the disc by encrypting it, or easier still, just putting it all in a zip file with a password before you burn it.  You will then have to provide a password to the unzipping software before you can access the data.  The downside to this method though is that you will have to extract the data (to your hard drive or other writable media) before you can access it.

<br>  Le lettere fra Kafka e Milena?<br>  La corrispondenza fra Michelangelo e Vittoria Colonna?

Non è internet che ci isola: abbiamo iniziato ad isolarci molto tempo fa... Ciò che ci isola è la mancanza di tempo a causa di orari sempre più frenetici, perciò il poco tempo libero che abbiamo lo passiamo con le cose che ci piacciono... Se anche chiudessero internet lo soppianteremmo subito con qualcos'altro e non cambierebbe nulla... Elton Jhon parla così forse perché ha 1) i soldi per fare quello che gli pare e 2) tutto il tempo libero che vuole, perché non penso che stia tutti i giorni per tutto il giorno a scrivere canzoni...<br>  Il vero problema di Elton John, come tutti i cantanti, sta nel fatto che non si vogliono adattare all'idea che il mondo della musica deve cambiare, perché l'arrivo di internet ha aperto nuovi orizzonti per lo scambio della musica... Il sistema musicale è obsoleto e sarebbe ora che cantanti vendessero direttamente al consumatore le canzoni, senza passare per tutti gli intermediari... E Elton John pensa, come buona parte dei cantanti, che la chiusura di internet risolverebbe tutti i suoi problemi di vendita di canzoni...|`|9647532ed53b04d12c600c75e90ef75eaa	è proprio vero che si insorge solo quando ti toccano il portafogli....|`|97725d0707f2d6cfa94399b2b1969f81aa	Io direi invece di abbassare i prezzi della musica: cd e concerti...altro che spegnere Internet!<br>  <br>  ciao!!|`|Wk1k2cKIaa	penso che il suo conto in banca sta scendendo rapidamente e a lui dispiaccia smettere di comprare mille vestiti al giorno, quindi perchè non trovare un modo per vendere di più, anche se questo farebbe rimanere senza lavoro chissà quanti milioni di persone, visto che ormai sono MOLTISSIMI i lavori che sfruttano internet o che si basano su esso.<br>  <br>  Internet non si spegnerà mai, almeno finchè non ci sarà un nuovo tipo di mezzo migliore, più che altro perchè su internet girano molti più soldi di quanti non ne faccia girare lui.

2R2ixYUgaa	Se tivesse pelo menos R$ 7000,00 nas m?os, eu compraria um computador nesse site ^^
y2j1Y1Tmaa	N?o só a quest?o de ser gratuiíto, mas de ser livre. Existe uma grande diferen?a: se você usa windows ou macos, você n?o é dono de sua máquina, o fabricante do sistema operacional que é. Ele te diz o que usar e quando usar e qualquer coisa fora disso é ilegal. N?o só os sistemas operacionais mas os aplicativos proprietários o amarram de um jeito descabido. Muitas vezes usuários s?o obrigados a atualizar software sem realmente precisar pois o suporte é descontinuado. Você compraria um carro com o cap? soldado de mnodo que você n?o pudesse trocar um filtro, por exemplo? Você compraria um carro que, sem mais nem menos para de funcionar e quando você reclama para o fabricante ele te manda dar a partida de novo e diz que é normal?<br>  Tirando os aspectos filosóficos, digamos, distribui??es recentes de linux como o Ubuntu 7.10 s?o estáveis, seguras (n?o apresentam problemas com virus ou malwares em geral) e aproveitam muito bem o hardware disponível.<br>  Uma coisa interessante ao se trabalhar com Linux é que você se esquece que existe esse negócio de "buscar driver". S?o raras as ocasi?es que um dispositivo qualquer já n?o tenha suporte diretamente no kernel (núcleo) do Linux. Existem sim algumas exce??es pois n?o s?o todos os fabricantes que d?o suporte a outra coisa que n?o seja Windows ou que permitem que outros programadores tenham acesso às especifica??es mas isso está se tornando cada vez mais raro. Press?o vinda de grandes fabricantes de hardware e software como IBM, Oracle e o sucesso do Linux em geral embalado por distribui??es fáceis de usar tem feito isso.<br>  Discordo do colega que disse que tem que seguir "o padr?o de mercado". Se uma pessoa é capaz de entender o que é uim processador de texto, uma planilha, etc, pequenas varia??es n?o far?o a menor diferen?a. Aliás, o servi?o público federal tem por meta o uso de software livre e está sendo pedido sim, conhecimentos de linux em concursos como do Banco do Brasil e Caixa do INSS recentemente.<br>  Uma coisa interessante é que as distribui??es linux atuais permitem ser testadas diretamente de um Live CD, sem precisar instalar. Baixe o CD daqui por exemplo <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download</a> , grave, rode na sua máquina. Gostou? Mande instalar.<br>  Como tudo que é novo, podes achar algumas coisas estranhas pois alguns conceitos s?o diferente mas, realmente, nada assustador.|`|Cd9e0GzYaa	Liberdade|`|yC4yxph3aa	Eu,particularmente n?o gosto de Linux.<br>   mas é bom que cria um concorrente para a Microsoft para melhorar as qualidades dos aplicativos e n?o deixar a Microsoft monopolizar os softs de sistemas operacionais.<br>   Linux é ruim,fui tentar configurar minha internet discada no kurumin,fiquei doido e melhor:n?o consegui!!!!|`|6e4be3b715b65f572c5dc8e4c6772dbaaa	N?o tem vírus. é de gra?a.

umVB72SJaa	Olá!<br>  As respostas de Edberto e do Ricardo Pereira est?o corretas, os outros n?o sabem do que est?o falando.<br>  <br>  1.

AA11588477	Well, you are trying to validate against w3, which is no easy task.<br>  <br>  There are very few websites that validate completely with w3 standards. The ones that do are usually quite simple, or lack advanced scripts. There is very little benefit to being w3 compliant, so it's really not necessary. Often, it's a pain in the butt trying to match their standards. (The only benefit I can think of is being able to put that little w3 validated icon on your website. It's solely for asthetic purposes.)<br>  <br>  You can stick with frontpage, but if you're spending money on web designing, you might as well go with Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver does a great job of converting pages into script (WYSIWYG). If you know HTML, free notepad apps such as Notepad++ and textpad are great too.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what program you use, if you want to fix those w3 "warnings," you really need to be knowledgeable in HTML and whichever languages you use. Just fix them one by one or simply  ignore them.|`|EkBL6PVBaa	adobe illustrator like CS2|`|Qf3kqJnJaa	find it at downloads.com i use topstyle.|`|dQ0RqSRuaa	If you want the basics try frontpage 2003.

cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	you should power down your system once in a while anyway.<br>  <br>  I know that "always on" connections make you think its ok to  keep the macine on non stop. but when you go to  bed power it off . <br>  <br>  that may not solve your problem but another better known fact is that when you reboot for the purpose of clearing a hang up is that you need to  leave the computer off for AT LEAST one minute. <br>  <br>  When you do restart are you going through a complete menu shutdown or just pressing and holding the power button til it goes off.? <br>  <br>  the next step if that doesnt work is to  restore from a previously good point using system restore inthe system section of your control panel . <br>  <br>  or do a full  back up of your data and then a full system recovery  thats assuming you have a recovery option available  <br>  <br>  any system  xp or after should have it. it is the countdown you see when you startup just b4 the windows logo appears hit the button they ask you to  before the logo appears.<br>  <br>  but save all your valuable data first|`|cnLGOAwsaa	If I understood your question I had this happen to me. A few days before it started doing what yours is doing I had accidentally spilled Coke on my computer table and some ran down the front of my computer and got into my start button. After it dried it became sticky. When I would turn it off it would go off, but when I would come back and turn it back on the button would stick and would not release. Therefore it stayed off. After about 15 minutes the spring on the button would finally unstuck it and it would come on. The fix; I took the front cover off and disassembled the “on” button. Cleaned it up real good and now it works like a champ.

Below is Information about Phishing. <br>  <br>  In case you haven’t heard of the term ‘phishing’; it basically entails a practice of sending out fake e-mails to individuals under the guise of a well-known company such as a bank or even eBay. When the individual who receives the e-mail clicks on the link contained in the e-mail, they will be immediately taken to a website that will then request that they enter details of their account. In some cases, the fake website will even rip off the graphics and logs of the company they are targeted so that they look more authentic.|`|biUUSNoEaa	YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.<br>  MYSPACE [[TOM]] ISNT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.<br>  YOU PROBABLY OPEN A BULLITEN THAT OFFERS STUFF OR W/E<br>  SO WHEN YOU OPENED THAT THEY TOOK YOUR PASSWORD AND HACKED YOUR PAGE.<br>  HAPPEN TO ME PLENTY BUT YEAH TOM IS WOKRING ON STUFF LIEK THAT IF YOU DONT READ HIS POST|`|jcnnVKvlaa	youve been phished

55474b711a6c2377665e85b5c171cfc6aa	Hola!!! En un principio tienes instalado un sistema operativo cuyo requerimiento mínimo para su buen funcionamiento, es el de disponer de una memoria Ram de 1 GB. Además, si cuentas con  una placa de video que aparentemente es de 64 Mb, dudo de que puedas encontrar algún juego de los que hay en la actualidad que pueda funcionar adecuadamente en el ordenador. Te sugiero que además de ampliar la Ram de tu sistema, cambies tu placa de video por otra que tenga al menos 256 Mb de memoria. De todas formas podrías consultar los requerimiento de cada juego, para así poder determinar si se ajustan a las características de tu ordenador y poder instalarlos.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|bwTgox0gaa	mirá, no sé a que tal actual te referis, para los juegos que están saliendo ahora no existe casi computadora para correrlos como dios manda. Yo tengo 1 gb de RAM y una placa de video de 128 mb, en un Pentium 4 eso si, pero te digo que no, me parece que tendrías que ir viendo la posibilidad de primero y principal, ir cambiando la placa aceleradora de video por una al menos de 256 mb, si podés NVIDIA, :-) despues veremos la RAM.

kmcmDJj2aa	Hi Jamie<br>  <br>  I have a Macbook, and it is a great computer. You can max out the memory at the Apple Store, and even buy a portable hard drive if you need lots and lots of memory. A Macbook is sturdy, durable, lasts long, and can easily get fixed if it has any problems, which it probably will not. you can be making movies, photo albums, keynote addresses and your own CD in just hours after taking your new Macbook out of its convenient box.|`|FjXLvQAGaa	get at least 1G of Ram...|`|eTzBe1Roaa	If you're playing games, go with the PC. Although once that Bootcamp thing comes out, you'll be able to run Windows on Macs. So you could wait for that and get a better computer with the ability to run two OS's or get the PC now if you're just impatient. Anyway, getting a laptop for gaming is a bit strange. I would hate that, but if you're up for that, go for it.<br>  <br>  Actually, it depends on what kind of games you want to get.<br>  <br>  I would do some heavy research before buying a computer. It took me a long time to decide what laptop to get.<br>  <br>  Regarding Photoshop, you would need a different version for Mac; I'm assuming you've used Windows most of your life, so just transferring that program won't really work. Unless you have Bootcamp of course. But then again, if you can afford Photoshop and a new laptop in the first place, just buy the copy anyway. Or illegally download it. Not that I'm promoting that.<br>  <br>  If you don't really know what I'm talking about, just do some independent research.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to that Apple propaganda below me!

5Un9BQMgaa	WEP is something that you would have had to set up and input a key when you first set the router up. Basically if you can take a laptop and connect to the router without having to key anything into the wireless set up you do not have WEP turned on.|`|dd539c649227fc326117b8f83b2592a7aa	The WEP is located internally in the router. You will have to plug the router directly into a computer and enter the ip address of the router in your internet browser. Have you setup your router with a WEP key? you might have to enter the cd that came with the router and set it up. good luck!|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	No, it is not on any tag on the out side. you will need to hard wire your computer to the router, access the router control panel, goto the security tab & copy the WEP key.
0PkI4pTmaa	You shouldn't go with Falcon NW or Alienware at all. Very overpriced. You can get the same specs for much cheaper. Check Newegg.com if you don't want to build it yourself, they sell pre built computers also.<br>  <br>  Unless you really need the mobility, 2K is going to buy a much faster computer then any notebook you can get for any price, but eigher way, after 2K, laptops barely get any better. I think you should go with a new 2K desktop if you can really afford it.|`|r8Z8wFAjaa	If I may make a different suggestion.<br>  <br>  Make a good computer for $1500 and buy a basic laptop for $500.  For $1500 you can make a good solid home computer for doing things like games, DVD crunching, etc.  <br>  <br>  With the $500 you save buy a basic laptop.  It will pretty much suck for games but even with a low end processor it will still be able to surf the net at a hotspot, watch DVD's flawlessly, and of course answer questions on yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  That way you get the best of both worlds.<br>  <br>  As for upgrading your crappy one, well, depends on how crappy it is.  I have three computers at home that all see use:<br>  <br>  And AMD K6-2 500 which I would never put money into, it just sits in a room downloading bittorrents<br>  <br>  My Athlon 1600XP which crunches DVD's and plays movies for my kids.  Again, I would never put money into it.<br>  <br>  My Athlon 3000 which can be upgraded to a Dual Core, 4GB of Ram and any PCI-e card I care to.

olzXIiSKaa	I know of a good website that has a music player and you can put it on your site. It's<br>  <a href="http://www.radioblogclub.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.radioblogclub.com/</a><br>  First you need to join, then search for your music using the search engine. Then a list of song should come up with a blue box with an arrow in it and another box with a heart. Put your mouse over the heart and click on my playlist, and it will add the song to your favorites.  Add all the music you want, and when you want to play it or see it, click on the button at the top right corner that says favorites. Then you might have to scroll down a bit but you'll see a pink button the says "detach juke.blog" It will then appear in another window. Right click near the edge somewhere and choose view source. Then copy the whole code and use it on your site. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No sorry it doesn't. And no I don't know of any that you upload your own music an either.

If you leave your computer on 24/7 it will eventually get you whatever you want.  The only problem is that it is painfully slow.  I think the fastest I've ever gotten in 3 or 4 years of use is 50kB/s.

Nbum168Faa	OK. go into WMP. Go into "Media Library". Find the icon above the playlist lists that says "Playlists". Click on it.... then on "new play list". A screen should pop up titled "New Playlist". In the "Playlist Name" box on the right hand side of the screen, give your playlist a title. Once you're done with that, click on songs you want on your CD that are listed on the left hand side of the pop-up screen. Hit "OK". Now go under "Copy to CD or Device" On the right side of the screen, find the scroll down box that says Now playing. Find the play list that you just created. Click on it. The songs that you picked should appear. They may start to play. Go over to the next scroll down box and find "CD Drive". Click on it. Incert a blank CD into your drive. Once you did that, under the red X (that closes the system) you will see the word "Copy" next to a red dot. Click it. Your songs should start to load onto the CD. You'll know they are when little boxes appear next to your song titles that seem to fill up. When all of the songs have done that, you can take out your CD and listen to it!

LUZtSEGcaa	acid pro and cakewalk are good loop based software designed to work with clips for remixing.  google them for the trial stuff.  they can be kinda pricy and are somwhat of a challenge to learn but are very powerful once mastered.
dOCDdh6jaa	You can either learn how to code well or just learn how to write code.  If you just want to learn how to write code, then by all means, jump right in.  Start with HTML.  It isn't a "programming" language, but it will get you used to the structure and syntax of code.  It's the easiest to learn because HTML doesn't perform logic operations or manipulate data.  <br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to code well and if you haven't received any formal education in computer science, then I would suggest starting with Intro to Programming-types of books to teach you the fundamentals of programming first, before you dive into specific languages and platforms.  There are design principals, development methodologies, and testing/quality fundamentals that apply to all technologies that you really need to master before you start worrying about syntax.<br>  <br>  It is easy to spot self-taught programming, because it typically lacks discipline and the fundamentals of good design and solid methodology.  It is much easier to master flowcharting, for example, when you aren't trying to understand arrays at the same time.  If you go this route, you can start familiarizing yourself with the technologies used to create whatever you aspire to be able to create without getting into the technical details up-front, when you don't yet understand what the technical details mean.  If you don't start with the fundamentals alone, you will immediately develop very bad habits that will be painful to change.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is that you learn the technologies that do whatever it is that you want to be able to create.  Which technologies you should learn totally depends on what you want to write programs to do.  Find examples of what you would like to be able to create, then find out what they are developed in.  Stay focused on those technologies only.  It's easy to want to learn a bit of everything, but you won't be able to create anything valuable until you know the technology and platform very well.  The value is not in knowing a little bit about as many technologies as possible.  The value lies in developing expertise.<br>  <br>  Goto a few college bookstore websites and find out what texts are required for the Intro-level computer science classes, along the lines of fundamentals of programming design and testing.  IEEE is where to go for standards.  www.ieee.org<br>  <br>  With solid fundamentals and disciplined methods, learning different technologies is much easier.  Once you "get" how to develop quality software, the rest is just syntax.  Applying the rules of syntax of one language versus another becomes the easy part.  Without solid fundamentals, your thinking and approach will tend to be limited, and learning different technologies will be especially challenging for you.|`|s6qu2HUiaa	it depends on what you really want to achieve: learn programming or write games. <br>  If you want to learn programming, my advice is: get a modern machine (not necessarily from the top range) and a book on Java, C# or VB.NET. I would suggest 'Introduction to Java programming' by Daniel Liang (it is used in universities and is pretty good). I think old machines won't help you much, well, unless you want to write some useless stuff. By the way, your first games will be text-based, and it will take some time to start with the graphics. <br>  But if your goal is to write games, you don't have to be an expert in computer science, because there are some tools and scripting engines for this, but you better google for it yourself.|`|ad7f322b0be451ccdd595af1c7421524aa	If you're pretty comfortable with math and logic I would just dive right in to the real stuff. C++ Primer Plus by Stephen Prata is a great book for beginners.<br>  <br>  If you want something simpler, check out the second link below, which is a comprehensive Pascal tutorial, good for beginners. It includes links to all the software you'll need, which is free and legal.<br>  <br>  If you're working with mid-90's computers I would shy away from web-oriented languages.|`|9kh0j1Lmaa	If you are absolutely new to programming, I would recommend you learn HTML and javascript. javascript is a very basic programming language used for making pop up menus and such in webpages.

9a116df579a24375d34007ea3f0af799aa	You do not have a proxy issue, you have a 'following the rules' issue.<br>  <br>  Circumventing the blocks are probably in contravention of your school's/company's/usage policies and would not be a good idea, resulting in banning, suspension or expulsion. The fact that you have to ask how to do it leads me to believe that you do not have the technical skill to avoid being detected.<br>  <br>  If you want to access stuff like YouTube or MySpace, be aware that the more bandwidth you are using, the more you are taking away from other legitimate users of that system.<br>  <br>  The sites have probably been blocked for a very good reason. If you're accessing from a public space, i.e. school, library, college, or other public access point, you should ask the administrators why they have blocked those sites.  Put your case as to why you should have access, but be prepared for a firm 'no'.|`|v8IaVFH4aa	If u use the proxies listed here i wish ur problem is going to be solved.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zeeproxy.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.zeeproxy.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prroxy.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.prroxy.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.proxsee.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.proxsee.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cellproxy.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.cellproxy.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tproxy.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.tproxy.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.proxymax.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.proxymax.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.proxytv.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.proxytv.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allrdude.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.allrdude.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amaderkotha.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.amaderkotha.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dufree.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.dufree.info</a><br>  <a href="http://www.freebread.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.freebread.info</a><br>  <br>  All are login enabled,fast and free.|`|K49Hl144aa	I've installed a patch on <a href="http://www.ovuh.com/proxy" rel="nofollow">http://www.ovuh.com/proxy</a> that should let you do these things.

For warez and movies your going to have a lot of trouble finding a web hosting company to take your business. The one that are around usually come with all sorts of bad scripts pre-installed to catch out your clients as that how they make their money 'Illegally' For porn you will find it not really such a big issue unless your going to host kiddie porn and then once again your going to quickly be in trouble. Most hosts that make compromises on whats held on their servers charge an arm and leg to let you do as you wish and turn a blind eye. You may well need to pay for a dedicated server that you maintain yourself with little interference from the main provider. Before you buy make sure you check with the hosting provider what they will and wont tolerate on their servers and many have the option to cancel service with no refunds for about of their contracts.

09644ZZSaa	There is a way to turn off the internet options from your browser (this is to prevent browser hijacking scripts from changing your internet settings) but you should be able to still access it from Control Panel. Are you using Spybot S&D? If so go in there and change the settings for it to protect IE. If you cannot access the options from both the browser and control panel, then you might have spyware or a virus that changed something and doesnt want you to change it back.|`|0Y5TkJFiaa	I'm not sure what you exactly mean...but you can right click on the Internet Explorer icon & go to Properties for any setting you need to see or change....I hope this helps...also if you meant the control panel item "internet options" that's probably a different name for some operating systems & even different versions in an O/S have different ways...<br>  nevertheless Internet properties will let you do the same thing as Internet options...
8LhDrJOgaa	Hellz yeah. Really it should.|`|c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	probably not. You'll need at least 128 MB of video RAM and a Nvidia or ATI card to have a lag-free game.

1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	You can't.  Read the fine print on the DVD case ... single layer DVDs are not actually 4.7 GB, they're 4,700,000,000 bytes, which is 4589843.75 kilobytes or 4482.26 megabytes, or 4.37 gigabytes (as 1 GB = 1024 MB and 1 MB = 1024 KB and 1 KB = 1024 bytes).
1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	You can not charge the phone using a computer without physically connecting the two, so you will need a USB cable, there is no way around that.  You do not need to buy a "special" "PC to Phone" cable or anything like that which they would charge you $40 for however ... the RAZR has a standard USB port on it, so any MiniUSB cable (like the type people use with digital cameras) will work.  You should be able to find one for $20 or less at any computer store, or you can order one online for less than $20.<br>  <br>  As for syncing, you will need Motorola Phone Tools to sync appointments and contacts with Outlook.  It is quite expensive on it's own, so I hope it came with the phone.  There is other, free software you can use, like BitPIM (<a href="http://www.bitpim.org/)," rel="nofollow">http://www.bitpim.org/),</a> but it's phone support is quite limited and I am sure you will not be impressed with it's features (and I do not believe it can sync between your Outlook address book and the phone, it can simply make a backup of your contacts for you).  If you can get your hands on a copy of Motorola Phone Tools, that is the way to go for syncing.
1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	Get a faster connection, that is the only way.  You can not exceed the bandwidth your connection is setup for.<br>  <br>  If you are under the impression that your downloads should be going 256 KB/s you are incorrect.  Your connection is 256 kilobits per second.  There are 8 bits in a byte.  Internet Explorer and most other programs report your download speeds in kilobytes per second, thus your downloads can never exceed 32 KB/s, and it is impossible to ever get them to even go that fast as there is overhead on the link as well as the file transfer itself.<br>  <br>  The proper abreviations are a lower-case b for bits, and an upper-case B for bytes.

1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	I'm guessing your new software for some reason disabled Windows Defender.  It looks like you should be able to re-enable it by doing the following:<br>  <br>  Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services<br>  <br>  Scroll down to Windows Defender and right-click on it and select properties ... "Startup type" should be "Automatic" ... if it was "Disabled" then after you change it and hit ok, right-click on the service again and select "Start" ... you should now be able to start the program normally ...<br>  <br>  Do you need it when you have other programs installed to protect your PC?  Well that's your call ... I personally do like to run more than one anti-spyware package, and sometimes even more than one anti-virus package ... sometimes one can catch things that the other does not ... if you do not feel the need for that level of protection, then I personally would uninstall Spybot and leave Windows Defender as I believe it to be one of the best anti-spyware packages around, but again, that is your call ...

09644ZZSaa	Try taking the router out and hook directly to the modem. If the problem persists its probably your ISP having the problem. I had cable internet before when I lived in the city and the box outside had a bunch of exposed wires and it was getting interference from radio signals and this was knocking out the internet constantly. I had to keep resetting everything like you have been doing but it would happen again.<br>  <br>  If you have cable internet, take the coaxial cable out of the back of the modem and turn on the TV. Touch the wire in the middle of the coaxial jack to the threaded surface of the jack on the back of the modem. If the TV's picture goes fuzzy and the TV makes a buzzing sound its definitely interference. When you take it away the TV will go back to normal.<br>  <br>  If this is the case as it was with me it will probably never get resolved. The cable company kept insisting that it was my modem, and the problem persisted until some cable guy who was hooking up someone elses cable in the apartment building straightened out the box outside and put the cover back on.|`|xExamsGRaa	well if its any thing like my friends that i worked on its ither ur cable lines or u need a new modem|`|2Dsmhb8oaa	Connect directly to modem with either PC or laptop. If problem persists you have a bad modem or Internet connection. If its good then you have a bad router.

If you want them actually ON your profile you'll need to set up an acct with a photo sharing website (which is really easy and user friendly) - I use photobucket.com - you'll upload your photo in pretty much the same manner as myspace.  Then it will display the photo with codes under it.  Copy the HTML code. Go to your MySpace Home - click edit profile and paste the code in the area you'd like it to display in.  :o)

Unfortunately, due to limitations in ICS, there are a number of caveats with this method.<br>  <br>  Like the Wi-Fi USB Connector software itself, ICS offers the user no configurable options. This means that ICS may not function as expected, or at all, in complex network environments. In addition, Windows cannot handle multiple ICS configurations simultaneously, or in other words, only a single application or network device can use and configure ICS at one time. This means that if your network is currently relying on ICS or you use software that utilizes it (such as Windows Media Center Extender for the Xbox 360),[9] you may not be able to use the Wi-Fi USB Connector at all.

b0cd2b697b1d3e6062654e5a06c7f289aa	you have to be in a wireless hot spot try going to a cafe or a library|`|foFOqqDUaa	I'm confused on what you mean when you say "whenever my computer is off the wireless internet works just fine" unless you have a second computer that you are trying to use over wireless at the same time as the first.  If that is the case then the problem may be your ISP is trying to limit you to only using one computer at a time.  Go to computer that you aren't trying to use wireless with, (assuming you are using Windows XP) <br>  <br>  1) Click on the 'Start Menu'<br>  2) Click 'Run'<br>  3) Type 'cmd' and press 'enter'<br>  4) Type 'ipconfig /all' and press 'enter'<br>  5) Write down what it says under 'physical address'<br>  6) Now you need to bring up the settings page for your wireless router.  The specifics of how this is done vary by model. You can:<br>  <br>  a) go to look up specific instructions for your model on the manufacturer's website<br>  b)post your model number here<br>  c)follow these generic directions<br>  <br>  7)To get to the settings page you type in the address of your router into the browser of your choice. It's probably <a href="http://192.168.1.1" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.1</a> or <a href="http://192.168.0.1" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.0.1</a> or http://<a href="http://192.168.1.254" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.254</a><br>  8)The username/password defaults for the settings page are probably some variation of admin/password or default/<blank> default/admin<br>  This page lists username/passwords for almost all router models <a href="http://www.phenoelit-us.org/dpl/dpl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phenoelit-us.org/dpl/dpl.html</a><br>  9)Look for a setting that says "Use this MAC address" or "Clone MAC address" or something similar possibly under an 'advanced' tab<br>  10)Enter the 'physical address' from step 5<br>  11)Click 'Apply' and close the window<br>  <br>  Now your ISP thinks your router is the first computer and several computers can operate behind it.

a58uXYrYaa	I had Vista Ultimate on my laptop, it is a Core 2 Duo 1.5GHz, 4GB RAM installed although all 32-bit operating systems see only 3GB.  Integrated graphics.  When idling, Vista as an OS was eating about 1.1GB of my memory (with Aero deactivated)- per Process Explorer by Sysinternals- a VERY nice replacement to task manager by the way.  I put XP Pro on it, and idling, it's consuming only 415MB of my memory.  XP runs a lot smoother, I think, although Vista has a little better driver support.  For instance, with XP, to install my printer, it takes a good 30 minutes (download is about 200MB for an HP All-In-One) plus install time.  With Vista, you plug the USB in, and 20 seconds later, it's fully functional.  That was the only advantage that I saw with Vista.<br>  <br>  If you want the OS to see all 4GB of your memory you need a 64-bit version of whatever OS you are going to install.  Downside to 64-bit- limited compatibility with devices.  In my opinion the advantages of going with XP outweigh the advantages of going with Vista, and the advantages of going with a 32-bit OS instead of a 64-bit OS outweigh the advantages of going with a 64-bit OS.<br>  <br>  And also, if the computer came with Vista, and you want to downgrade to XP, obviously you will need to either partition your hard drive or do a complete re-install.  If you do a complete re-install, and your hard drive is a SATA hard drive, you need to include the SATA controller support to your Windows XP cd (meaning, burn an ISO image of XP and include the SATA support- if you need help with that email me at marks.mike@yahoo.com).  The reason is XP doesn't support SATA hard drives.  It won't detect your hard drive during the install.|`|81a5640775e843cf20eb0e54753d2228aa	It all depends on what setup you prefer. Everything is switching to Vista, that much is inevitable. As for the "Vista Problems" they're always going on about in the Mac commercials, those are almost non-existent. The "allow or deny" messages don't come up that often, and they are only there to protect you from unwanted programs. There is really no reason not to go with Vista over XP; unless you computer doesn't have the hardware to keep up with it. 1.6 Ghz is the lowest processor speed you can have to run Vista. So all in all, Vista is a better OS, but XP will be faster on your setup. And as for the optical drive, most do both CD and DVD.|`|rl9PMTvQaa	RAM- OK!<br>  PROCESSOR- NOT OK<br>  .......<br>  Intel core 2 duo or core 2 quad seems to be much better option,<br>  intel C2D E4600 2.4Ghz -$150,<br>  intel C2Q Q6600 2.4Ghz-$270<br>  both are best buy's..............<br>  .........<br>  GRAPHIC CARD- NOT OK AT ALL....<br>  .......<br>  the one which you have is nothing more than trash..<br>  XFX8600GT or 9600GT are the bestest best options for you,<br>  8600GT- 512mb -$130,<br>  9600GT- 512mb-$170,<br>  ..........<br>  OS- SIMPLY XP if you are a gaming bug,<br>          SIMPLY VISTA if you are an internet bug..........<br>  rest all OK........|`|ZWjJRGfGaa	you must be use xp profesional sp3 which is best and more reliable and bug free. vista is good but vista contain too many bugs till now and its incompatible with too many drivers and program.<br>  and you can by a dvd writer which i think the best choice for you.|`|2sczpos9aa	The processor seems well outdated, I'd highly suggest XP over Vista.

It might be expensive, but they are good computers.|`|4X7NYULZaa	hi there!  I asked the very same quesitons two years ago.  I decided that for watching movies and running windows and stuff, MacBook is awesome.  Now... if you're into graphic design, and making movies then I would recommend that you go with the MacBook Pro, which has better capabilities for that kind of creative work.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|EZVKKjldaa	The Macbook Pro all the way. Faster graphics card and processor, there's no way to go wrong with it. The Macbook is nothing compared to it :)
YK5Mg2wBaa	I think Vaughan H just didn't want to tell you "NO" what you have isn't enough. You will need more RAM, and a faster video card. That "may" do it If, your computer RAM and Video Card can be upgraded to one that's fast enough. This all depends on your computers Motherboard. I have a laptop with 2.0 GHZ Pentium M processor and a GeForce Go 6800 Ultra PCI express video card. It runs, and I have to turn down the graphics, but I "CAN" play it.|`|Cl6npbxUaa	Minimum Requirements:<br>  Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 2800+ processor or any 1.8Ghz Dual Core Processor or better supported<br>  512 MB RAM (768 MB RAM for Windows Vista)<br>  8 GB of free hard drive space<br>  Video card (generic): NVIDIA Geforce 6600 or better or ATI Radeon 9800Pro or better<br>  <br>  Recommended Requirements:<br>  2.4 GHz dual core or better is recommended<br>  1 GB RAM for XP, 2 GB RAM for Vista is recommended<br>  3.0 Shader Support recommended, Nvidia Geforce 7800 or better or ATI Radeon X1800 or better
eb41327d69e0624f561e4fdadef833b5aa	I don't know exactly what the specs of that computer is, but what you can do is search for the manufacturer of the device you're looking for, then go to the manufacturers website and download it, if it was made by Sony themselves then you may encounter a problem. looking on their website for a possible close match is all i can recommend in that case, or just try a few of the drivers for the older pcs on their website that have xp on them.
mnLvkyotaa	yep i have myspace and i love it!!!!!|`|GZX1zvw8aa	YEZIR! =]|`|ajrzEfwuaa	yes, i have one. try it, i use it for my friends, it's like friendster, but the good thing is you can send instant messages in myspace like yahoo messenger. try it... it's cool!!!|`|lDsZkwFLaa	Everyone has a myspace, by now.

d569848d2b209578ed50b24ea1db80efaa	NEWEGG.com  they have some of the best prices around.  I've bought over 3K worth of stuff from them.  Everyone I know uses newegg.  Also depending on where you are in the US, their 3 day shipping is more like 1 day/overnight.  I ordered a micro$soft laser mouse for 34$ at 1pm thurs: shipped from CA, had it in Las Vegas at 2pm the next day: cost 3.99.  By the way I think a stick of 184pin 512mb is as cheap as $24.|`|jMoYWNXcaa	get a dance factory instead<br>  they will play any song from any of your music cd's.<br>  they're AWSOME<br>  and not that expensive|`|nWXMXy3Waa	Most RAM has a lifetime warranty so any used ones at E-Bay/Amazon will suffice but I never thought the stuff new was expensive BTA I've seen RAM at peak dollars so try New Egg.<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com</a>
mGVIzXLaaa	It has to do with the language bar. Follow the link to find out how to stop it loading at start-up if you don't need it (which most of us don't)|`|C9QpGkPKaa	yes it should be like that. even you uncheck the ''ctfmon'' which i tried earlier, it will be check back again. I don't know how. But i guess this is required for your system to function properly.|`|ZWjJRGfGaa	Yes it may be a spyware because ctfmon is a necessary file for running windows correctly. And few spy programs are use the same file name for spy anyone personal data.<br>  <br>  Use a spy remover program for check it and clean it, I suggest you to use spyware blaster which is a freeware.|`|uVJLKIGqaa	If you really want to know what cftmon is, how to uninstall it, etc, you can have a look at Microsoft page at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282599" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282599</a>
rzoTdW7Baa	There are a couple ways to do this<br>  <br>  1. The standard way is to get a router (this must be a router, not a switch or a hub, home or small office routers come with a 4 port switch built-in), connect the computers to the router and connect the router to your DSL modem, the router should come with directions on how to set it up and how to access it<br>  <br>  2. Another way is to pay for 2 IPs and use a hub or switch, what you do is you buy a hub or a switch (switches are better, and can be faster), connect your DSL modem to the hub or switch, then call your ISP, which in this case is your phone company and ask for 2 IPs (if they ask, you want a dynamic IP), you will have to pay more per month though<br>  <br>  3. This is pretty difficult, and I don't really reccomend it, but some people think this is a better idea, you can buy another network card, and install it on the computer you wish the DSL modem to be connected to so you have an ethernet port for your DSL modem, and you have another ethernet port to connect the other computer, you can set up internet connection sharing (do a google search formore information), or you can look for routing software, if you find routing software, if it is set up correctly, it is a lot easier to use then internet connection sharing, then connect the computers together using a crossover cable (like an ethernet cable, except the wires are switched inside to connect similar devices, like computer to computer, or switch to switch)<br>  <br>  If you are looking for the easiest way to connect 2 or more computers, I would say the first one, to get a router, it's meant for multiple computers and is meant for ease of use|`|hSgWF5praa	you need a router|`|HwxdBpreaa	get a dsl modem/router(actiontec,westell,2wire and netopia)<br>  are some dsl modem/router|`|EQhY4x05aa	Get a DSL Router, plug the DSL modem into the router, plug your computers into the router.  You may also need to configure the router.
oSRCpSTwaa	Hey if your have a wireless router sending out signals you can use that to access the internet on Wii but if you haven't you need to buy an adapter which will give you the ability to plug in a Ethernet cable that's how much I know there is nothing else you can do and from them I would recommend you buy the first one the first link because it is a Nintendo make so it is guaranteed not to have any problems.|`|YHpljlqjaa	get a router|`|jgP51MlRaa	I got a phillips wireless router and usb adapter to plug into our wii and it works really well.<br>  <br>  It cost me ￡39.99 from PC world<br>  <br>  Maj
