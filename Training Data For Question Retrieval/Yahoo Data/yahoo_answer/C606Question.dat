20090202101322AAA7oCt	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I encourage my pregnant teen daughter to better herself?	My 18 year old step-daughter told me a couple weeks ago that she is pregnant. Up until that point, she told no one and by the time we got her to the doctor, she was in her third trimester. She has no job, does not keep jobs longer than a week or two, dropped out of high school and lives on friend's couches with her jobless, drop-out boyfriend.   The two of them moved in with her mother two weeks ago, so at least now she is eating properly and has a relatively stable environment. She had to apply for welfare to get medical benefits. The pregnancy organization that she is going to offers programs to get a GED, driver's license and job training. She has not taken advantage of these services and when I encourage her to use the time until the baby comes to get these things she just stares at me blankly, shrugs her shoulders and tunes everything out.   Her father and I are at our wit's ends. Any suggestions?

20090202101200AAaqxvr	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you judge your friend for saying this? ?	I told my friend that when I get married I'm going to elope. This girl used to invite me to her house every single day and after I said that, I never heard from her again. I had aneorixa for six years, my parents wer angry at me for embarrassing them and would not take me to a doctor. My father doesn't respect me because I'm fat. He forced me to lie and say I have an intellectual disability so I can collect disability from the government because he was too lazy to teach me how to get a job. My mother told me I was a piece of **** everyday. I despise both of my parents and would celebrate if they both died in a heart attack today. This is the real reason, I won't invite them to my wedding but I didn't explain that to her because who wants to hang around someone whose depressed and sad all the time.

20090202101054AAApV0R	Family & Relationships;Friends	Anyone else lose a best friend through a fight? How did you get over it?	This girl and I were best friends, lovers even (well friends with benefits), we talked all the time... until, that is she met a guy and started falling for him. The guy and I couldn't stand each other... and me and my friend had a huge fight over it. This was 3 months ago... and she hasn't tried to make up with me (she usually did) and we haven't talked. She apparently is in love with this guy now. I'm still devastatingly hurt over it all... I just want to forget her. But I still think about her a lot even though I don't see her often. Anyone else go through something similiar? How did you get over it? Our friendship falling out wasn't just one person's fault... we both were at fault I think, but I just don't want to dwell on it anymore.
20090202101128AAM2EyO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My heart is shattered into 1 million pieces...?	My heart is shattered into 1 million pieces...?   I'm 19 years old and I've never had a boyfriend before. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with depression and anxiety and OCD. I spent a lot of it in the hospital. I could barely walk 4 feet without having an extreme panic attack. (Please don't leave cruel comments)      Finally, during my twelfth year of high school, I started to get better. I developed a massive crush on a guy. He had just broken up with his girlfriend who cheated on him while drunk. We became friends and I told him how proud I was of him for getting out of an abusive relationship. Eventually he developed feelings for me too. He told me he was over his ex. That I was a sweet classy girl and that his ex couldn't compare to me. Since I was depressed for a while I lost a lot of my friends due to my illness. So opening up to him was a HUGE thing and he knew that. He promised me he wouldnt hurt me. I told him about everything I went through. He convinced me he was over his ex. I told him how happy I felt to have an actual friend. How sick I've been and how much he meant to me.      For a month or two we lost contact because he started university and he told me had a lot of homework. He said as soon as he was done he would spend time with me.       then he texts me and says hes getting back with his ex gf who cheated on him while drunk. He must really love her. He knew what ive been through, so why would he play with my emotions like that and lead me on to believe we were gonna have a relationship? i feel used. betrayed.      that was the first guy that ever showed interest in me, and he destroyed me.. is she better than me? im a classy girl.. i respect myself..why do the cheaters always get the guy :(   god im crying while writing this   im so pathetic         btw he doesnt even talk to me as a friend anymore. HE PUSHED ME OUT OF HIS LIFE COMPLETELY

And he has never been possessive with me and we've been dating 4 months now.    I know this is a strange q, but why would he be possessive with his past g/fs and not me?

Ugh, the reason why I ask, is cause' my friend (who's a girl) and I made a bet and the terms were that the loser will have to be the winner's slave for a week.   Well I lost, so now I have to my friend's slave. So i thought she'd make me do chores or something. But then! she mentioned to me that she knows how much I hate feet and is going to make my week "so incredibly humiliating and disgusting, AND unforgetful!" She added that since she "owns" me for the week that she has the right to volunteer some friends of hers. Ok so anyway, she mentioned how during my first day as her slave, she was going to have three of her girlfriends come over and use me. What does she mean use?? she said something about her not going to take a shower at all..DOES THAT MEAN WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?!?       would any of you girls actually make a guy do this?   I mean if so, and my friend actually DOES make me do whatever she has planned then I'll be a sav' n do it...but we'll see I guess

I just knew that it wasn't gonna work... we always had some arguments and stuff) .Anyway, of course he was upset, but we work together! How do I let him know that I'm sorry how everything went down but that we're just too different (in the way we see things). I guess I just wanna be okay/or on decent terms, especially since we work in the same place! Should I say anything? Leave it alone? If yes, how? I know he's mad so I need help.

(BY THE WAY, SOME OF THE MESSAGES SHE READ WERE ABOUT HER!!! in the messages i called her an *** and i said that she wore too much f**kin make-up. i know this sounds rude.)       the next day i heard my step mom talkin to my dad. she was telling him that she was going to confront me with the situation. she was of course furious! anyways, i called my dad and asked him how my step mom knew about it. he said that a certain someone read my messages. i got FURIOUS! i texted my step sis and asked her y she read my messages. she said because she was bored!!! i..got..sooooo..mad!!!!!!! so the point of this question is..should i apologize for what i said even though she read my messages and if she wudnt have read them then this wud have never started????? thanks for the help in advance.            P.S. My dad told me last night that i have to forgive her. he said that i had to sit down with both of them individually and tlk to them and apolgize. should i???

Is this normal? Should i care?      There are times where i feel i'm never gonna meet someone like and i'll die alone ... which maybe coz im in the TA atm and in future, after university, im off to join the Royal Marines for a few years like ... but anyway -- my problem; no sex/girlfriend in a year, this normal?       off to uni next year and hoping to meet someone but i somewhat doubt it -- PLUS my ex-girlfriend (first love bird) has now got in a new relationship with an older guy (25yo) ... and even though i don't love her anymore - AT THE MOMENT, that is driving me nuts! Should i care? coz somehow i do and im botherd, can someone/anyone shed somelight on this ...       i know im sounding crazy, obsessed, and "101 problemy" like, -- just girl-lonely, and unsure of future :/ -- -- could use some advice from an older man/woman for some life and dating advice! :)

20090202102251AApSSLY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please answer? He just looks so sad and confused and it kills me?!?	Ok well, My fiance, Patrick, who is 26, is very understanding with my emotions. He can read me very well, and he almost always knows what to do depending on what mood I'm in. I also have depression (Not serious) and he always understands that when I'm moody and upset or lonely. However, he can hardly understand his own emotions. He's going through a tough time right now (His best friend is in the hospital with extreme depression after trying to kill himself twice, and Patrick deals with minor depression himself,) and he just doesn't get his feelings... He doesn't know what to do with himself when he's upset... he just zones out and sits there trying to understand it...      I mean, he's a singer/guitarist, and he writes his own lyrics. I'm his vocal coach, so I'll look over his music with him (which has deep emotion in it... He writes it all based on his current mood,) and ask him what a certain line means, and he'll answer, "...I don't know, actually..." when at the time he wrote it, it made perfect sense to him. I'll ask him "Well what were you feeling when you wrote it?" and he'll answer "I don't remember," or "I don't know." I love him to death, but it's so frustrating!       Ladies, are your men like this? Do they ever figure out their feelings?! Are most men like this? Or is it just my fiance? What am I supposed to do with him? He nearly kills himself trying to make me happy :) I appreciate it so much, and try to help him too, but sometimes he seems to push away the help and just sits with a confused look on his face... All I can seem to do at those times is just give him a hug and tell him I'm there for him. I don't know what else to do!
20090202102522AAuyr1m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused with my feelings about a male friend?	I've been close friends with one of my male friends for 5 years now, and I've never been sure from the moment we met whether I like him more than a friend or not. I always seem to spend more time with him than with any of my other male friends and I sometimes find myself just gazing into his eyes, but I have always put off the idea of being with him because I thought it would be weird, especially as we always gave each other dating advice, etc. Just recently he got a girlfriend, and I've felt a pang of jealousy whenever he mentions her. I've never been sure about how I felt about him, until now. Is it too late? I'm 16 by the way
20090202102253AAHh8pj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Indian girl want to date an english man, can you help?	My english co-worker likes me and has conveyed interest a long time ago. I have been avoiding it from a long time due to cultural differences.  But, I really want to try with him. If nothing else, it will be an experience for me.    Now, my issues with this:  - although I am professional, attractive, 31 year old mature lady. And, i am quite attractive as well, but, I am in UK from 5 years now. I am indian girl, and I have learnt most of my english etc through work only.  - I do listen to english music, but, i can still not understand new songs in one play.  - i don't fully understand stand-up comedies.  - my sense of humor is not fully developed for the obvious reasons that I am not brought up in UK.     I also find it hard to always follow coversations with my british  colleagues. I do socialise with many people, and manage well, but, in a date or intimate relationship, I am not sure if I can strike a long ,proper, and an interesting conversation.    I feel that as soon as I get close to him, our difference will not let us continue with this relationship.    What is your opinion about my situation? We stare at each other a lot, and he really tries to get close , but, i always pull out because I feel we won't get along well any way.    please give your genuine opinion on my situation.  thanks in advance.

20090202102336AA7rE9b	Family & Relationships;Friends	My BF Says that  I am trying to hard to make our relastionship work.  What does trying to hard mean??????????>?	My BF told me that I was trying to hard to make our relationship work.  What does he mean?  I text him throughout the day, I see him once  a week maybe 2 times a week, i send him cards all the time to show him how i love him.  I have asked him if he could spend more time with me because weonly get one day together and its not the whole day. He sayshe wants to be with me one day, have a family thing and so on.  He says he loves me and is crazy about me. I buy him very expensive things for b-days and cmas.  What does trying to hard mean?

20090202102408AAI1TtM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend pregnant with girl, now I don't want to have sex with her?	My girlfriend is about 20 weeks pregnant, I had no qualms regarding having sex with her, that is until I found out we're having a girl.  If it was a boy for some reason I wouldn't have minded.  I just would feel bad for having sex with her since there's a little girl is inside of her.  She has bought all kind of lingerie for valentines day and I'm sure she will want to "celebrate" accordingly, but I know that I won't do it, and I'm anxious about the looming arguments to ensue.  Maybe I will just get real **** faced and just pass out on Valentine's day as an excuse not to do it.  Any advice?

We have been engaged since December 25, 2007. My associates at school and my classmates are all surprised of it, and they all have comments and opinions. My family members have had a problem with it, but they now have learned to accept it. I'm in college and I live on campus, he has his own place. People say that I should be with someone my age. My mom says it too, and she also say these things: that in the future I'm going to be taking care of a old man. And that this guy has been with over 100 women. And so on! What do you think?

20090202103442AAnHB9Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just cant get over him, keep blaming myself?	My ex fiance left me on christmas eve saying that he needed time to think (we had an argument a couple of days before an I had said some nasty things, mentioning my ex) He didnt contact me for the whole of the festive period, so I thought it was over. Then after new year, he said that he wanted me back. To split up with me again 2 weeks later. I found out that he had had sex with two girls over christmas, although I had ended up in bed with his friend on new years eve ( I was drunk, upset and he was there ) although we didnt have full sex. My ex was saying that he wanted me back, that he couldnt live without me, got me some roses sent to where I work, etc. Then when he asked his mate about what happened with me and him and his friend denied it, my ex thought I had lied about it to hurt him, and split up with me again. Now I see him out and he is getting off with loads of girls, kissing and trying it on with other people, and I dont think its coz he knows that I am there either. I just cant get over him. I am constantly thinking about him, talking about him, analizing everything that has happened. I just cant seem to move on, and surely if he cared as much as he said he did he would be the same? I mean, I know I'm not angel but I dont think I deseved to be treated how he has done me. What do you think? I am 20. I just think that I will never find anyone as good as him, he is a successful builder with his own house and a lot of money, and I have a crappy part time job and live with my parents. Everyone has took his side too. What do you think, help me please?
20090202103529AA4ze9y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys...Do you find ALL women attractive?	I'm amazed by some of the girls that guys think are attractive. I can candidly speak the truth here with you as strangers, so I will... I feel there are VERY FEW TRULY attractive people in the world. Have you ever searched celeb photos without makeup? It's frightening! Maybe I am very critical, but I don't consider a good body, big boobs, or a pretty face on an overweight body attractive. I score overall, which is what makes me give such low scores. So, back to my broken down question, is it safe to say that guys think just about any girl is hot? I hear guys calling girls hot that I would never look twice at or admire in any way. I found myself just last night, TRYING to find something about this girl in particular that a guy said to me was hot. When I turned to look at her I was shocked! She was over weight,poured into her jeans, very large bucket face, drawn on eyebrows bleached greasy hair, orange skin, and appeared to be in her thirties! I found out she is low 20's. What gives guys? Anything 'll do??    -Curious and bewildered!
20090202103522AAif8rj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I rekindle my relationship with my husband when he drives me NUTZ!?	My husband seems to have done everything the wrong way since we got married, and it seems like I have made the wrong decision by marrying him.      He lied to me when we were dating--he had a fiance at the time, and was trying to get his ring back from her without telling either one of us the truth.      For whatever reason, I overlooked this, and married him. I found out later that he had a huge pornography addiction that he was hiding from me. I thought I had married a wonderful guy, but I actually married a liar and a pervert. When confronted about it, he said he was molested as a child and had been addicted to pornography secretly for over 10 years. We went to see a councelor who told us we were on the brink of a divorce and that we needed to seek help. It has been 2+ years and he cannot get any time off work to get any help with me.      He cannot say NO to other women. I know this can be a questionable argument, since some people see nothing wrong with it, but I dont want him giving female co-workers rides home from work. He just sees it as being nice, I see it as a desperate woman who is trying to get something from a married man. Why cant he just say, "Im sorry, i cant, no, I'm going home to my wife and son" and have some balls? I feel like he does not put my feelings first.      I feel like the man of the relationship and it drives me crazy. I am the strong one (not physically, but verbally, emotionally, and I am the one who puts work before play). He does not hear what I say and often tunes me out. He has excuses for everything and has the IQ of a cork.      Emotionally, I feel totally drained. He does not listen, rarely thinks about my needs and feelings, and it makes me wonder what am I doing with someone who thinks its ok to lie to me and doesnt want to listen to what I have to say? I cannot stand being with a man who has the willpower and the intelligence level of a dog. I get very little enjoyment out of sex with him anymore, it seems like that was all it is ever about and I feel used.

20090202103552AAC9AkF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Complicated situation with girl i dated...need help and advice.? yes its long ?	Complicated situation with girl i dated...need help and advice.? yes its long ?   we dated for acouple of months after her and her boyfriend broke up but in the end she decided to go back to him. I was going to stop talking to her all together but she still called me and I still wanted to talk. I told her i feel like were together and she said the same thing. we seriously do this all the time where we would stop talking and it happen 3 times this last month. I really do like her and i think i have fallin for her but she recently did something to me that really turned me off and said things that gave me red flags. She basically ditched me on my bday and went to meet up with boyfriend and told me she would come back or at least call me back to tell me if she can come. She never returned my call that night and went to sleep god knows where she claims her house but w/e and had class in the morning but never called me the next day to apologize and i proceeded to text her the next day saying basically wow an amazed what she did to me. and proceeded to go tell her to go F her self and only cares about herself. We got into an arguement and said to me you gave me a red flag when you told me that and has to really think "about us". So i got scared when she said that and i thought i should just end it right there and tell her to stop talking for now to me. She said i was ****** up and that we couldnt make our relationship work if we were ever in one. That relationships you dont run away from problems you try to make it work... I basically laughed at this because i said to her what relationship? we were never in one so how can i run away to our problems. You cant have two different people that it does not work that way. she said i was abandoning her and told her we can only become friends. She then texted me and said to me oh how she could not believe how i am doing this today and i havent return her text message at all today. I really want to be with her and i want her as my friend atleast but i cant just act and pretend we have something when we offically dont. ... she continues to cal and text me and i feel like responding i cant do this anymore. She has me as her back up and dosent want to break up with her boyfreind and yet tell me she loves me but when in fact i know she loves the other guy too. SHe tells me i cant be with other girls because she would not talk to me. And i think thats messed up that we still could not talk adn be friends if that was to happen. There was also another thing that bother me she said that if they ever broke up and she was with me that her boyfriend would still call her. THey known each other for 3 years while I known her for almost 6 months. I dont know what to do i want to be with her but i cant put myself through this anymore because i feel like im going insane and i cant function or do school work im in college btw and hang out with my friends. Personally i dont want her out of my life because i care about her that much but i cant wait around for her forever and she does not watn to be wtih me fully by leaving her boyfriend for me. So many problems. Yes she has cheated on him with me if your wondering. I know its wrong but i really do love her and i want to be with her. So finally i decided to call her and tel her today that we should just both move on but she did not pick up and then she asked why i called in text message and i just told her that and she was like im tired of me always doing this and she is not playng tis back and forth **** with me. (she is always the one that chases me and i fall back into it)  and she see's how it is now. and told me good bye.  I feel bad i dont know i jsut feel like everything i did was my fault. Oh man i miss her. I dont know anymore  i wish i was with her but she never wanted to leave him for me. Damn.

Hey everyone,      I may meet a girl on an online dating site very soon. After the date, if I find there is no chemistry between us, how I do I respectfully end it with her with out being rude. I want to be honest, but not sound like a bastard. Do I tell her at the end of the date that there was no chemistry and maybe I wont want to see her again, do I say it was nice meeting her and say I'll be in touch then call, email or txt her to tell her that I think we should go seperate ways? I don't want to be the typical guy who never calls back, it's happened to me before in the past and I don't want to do that to any woman.      Please give me some advice.      I know I will get some silly answers but I truely appreciate all those who took time to give honest thought out answers.

So, when he wrestled I looked up his name in the bracket and I added him on Facebook.      My intent with this was to tell him I liked his socks, just to be friendly and kind of silly I guess. Anyway, later that day I got a text from this number I didn't know and it turned out to be from him. We have been talking for awhile.      He is going to be at the next wrestling meet and obviously we want to actually talk to eachother. My problem is, I know it's going to be a little awkward so....what do I say to him?

I'm abit worried, she doesn't return my phone calls or emails. I thought it was just she needed time to settle in, but 3 months?      I recently got engaged and I want to tell her about it....we werent fighting before she left and i was at her house up until the day i hugged her goodbye when she got in her car to drive there.       It's quite odd! I saw her brother and he said he hasnt talked to her in about 2 months and she only called to ask him to ship something from their parents house. So I know shes not missing...      Isn't this odd?      We are 27.

20070902022203AA4Rp5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Busco novio??	Nose si busco un novio o no... hace mas de seis meses que estoy sola, y no siento nada con nadie, ni por mi ex novio y ningún chico me gusta. Tengo 26 a?os y todos mis amigos ya estan casados(as) o tienen novios (as) y soy la única soltera. Cuando salgo con mis amigos (as), pues todos salen en parejas y me hacen sentir sola, no tengo con quien salir y no me gusta salir sola. Ya no quiero salir con mis amigos pero tampoco quiero quedarme en casa sin salir.    ?les ha pasado? no estoy dedesperada por un novio, pero dadas las circunstancias parece que solo teniendo uno o salir con algún chico  me podría divertir. No m e  puedo meter a ningún curso nuevo o algo así porque llego tarde de trabajar y estudiar. Lo peor de todo es que cuando salgo con ellos no puedo conocer a nadie nuevo pues nadie se me acerca porque estoy con mucha gente. ?Qué hago? ?a alguien le ha pasado esto?

Il a comparé ca à des pierres : la fille banale est un cailloux, moi qui suis déjà super je suis une pépite d'or, et la fille de ses reves, qui lui correspondrait totalement ca serait le diamant.Pour lui les cailloux y'en a partout, les pépites d'or sont rares et le diamant est unique et donc très très rare.

20080917053917AAIVSf2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Ma tante sexy histoire à lire?	Salut,   Je vais vous raconté mon histoire.Cela c'est passé en juin dernier,j'ai 16 ans je suis en premiére année de Bep et comme c'était la fin d'année on devait effectuer un stage en entreprise.L'entreprise se trouvait à 1heure de chez moi, il était alors impossible de manger chez moi le midi.Ma tante me proposa alors de manger chez elle durant le mois car l'entreprise se trouvait prés de chez elle.   Je mangeais tous les midis chez elle, sans que rien de spéciale ne se passe.Le dernier jour j'allais chez elle et quand je sonna à sa porte je  l'aper?u en robe à moitié trasparente avec des talons, j'étais alors excité.A vrai dire elle ma toujours excité,je me rappel meme que lorsque j'avais 13 ans je me suis branlé chez elle sur ses strings.   Elle avait la cinquentaine,brune avec des lunettes de gros seins,1m55 et quelques rondeurs et des jambes manifiquesJe l'aida comme à mon habitude à préparer la table.   Puis vint l'heure du repas, je la mattais à chaque fois qu'elle se levait,on rigolait bien pendant cette heure comme d'hab, c'était une femme sympas, elle était divorcée depuis prés de 20ans.A la fin du repas lorsqu'elle se leva pour débarasser les plats elle fit tomber de l'eau entre mes cuisses elle essuya par réflexe et vu que j'étais en érection.Elle partit précipitamment dans la cuisine sans rien dire.5 longues minutes plus tard, elle revenait, sans avoir une réaction particuliére.Par la suite nous ragardions la télé et elle était trés prés de moi j'étais en érection.Elle me demanda " je t'excite tant que sa ?" j'était géné et je ne repondis rien mais j'étais rouge de honte.Durant l'émission de télévision je mattais ses énormes seins.J'étais pratiquement collé à elle,je transpirais elle le savait et se leva de tant à autre pour que je matte ses fesses.Lorqu'elle revint je fesais exprés de toucher à ses jambes et elle le savait.Puis je me lan?a,je me rapprocahais progressivement d'elle et je commen?a à poser ma main sur sa jambe sans qu'elle ne dise rien,je mis ma main dans ses cuisses et la c'étais mouillée et là elle me regarda "petit pervers baise moi",j'exécutais en lui répondant "oui Suzanne" j'enlevais vite mon jeans et mon tee **** et je l'ai pris en levrette pendant prés de 4 minutes,elle cria "encore petit pervers" avant que je lache mon jus et elle avala.Puis elle m'embrassa et je devais partir travailler car j'était en retard.Depuis sans nouvelle.   Qu'est-ce que vous pensez de mon histoire avec ma tate ?      Ps:elle ma dépuceler et c'est la cousine à mon pére

20080917082529AAExfCO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Pour les filles, et c'est sérieux....?	J'ai fait une formation au travail (j'ai 45 ans) avec une collègue de l'usine, un canon cette nana, elle me semblait intelligente, sensée, mais qu'elle déception en la connaissant mieux. je vous explique:   On a sympathiser ce fameux jour de travail, le lendemain elle est venue chez moi mais je n'y étais pas! Le soir mon voisin vient me voir et me dit tous gêner    "tu sais ta copine est venue",    j'ai pas de copine!   Ben si C.........ine   Ah ouais c'est une cop de boulot.   Ben elle est venue, tu n'étais pas là et 5 minutes après elle était dans mon pieu, désolé mais je préfère te le dire.   Depuis ce jour je n'essaie meme pas de la revoir, mais elle revient sans cesse. je discute avec elle, je cotoie ses amis(e) et j'en apprend de belle, melle couche par pure plaisir de satisfaire ses copains et en fin de mois difficille elle n'hésite pas a se faire payer.   J'ai beau lui dire de me laisser tranquille, mais rien n'y fait, elle revient sans cesse me disant qu'elle arretera ses conneries.   je n'ai aucune confiance en elle et je crois bien que je continuerais de la mettre dehors a chaque fois qu'elle reviendra.   Ma question est : comment une femme peut-elle s'offrir ainsi ? je la voit comme une prostituée...rien d'autre, et je n'aime pas ces femmes là.

Je précise que c'est mon amie qui m'a demandé en mariage, je n'ai pas osé dire non pour ne pal lui faire de mal.   Si j'ai une relation avec une autre et que ma (future) femme n'en sait rien, elle n'en souffrira pas, donc tout est bien qui finit bien.Si je la quitte, ce sera horrible pour elle, je le sais par sa mère qui me l'a dit et qui est au courant.   Je précise qu'entre la personne qui me trouble et moi, il n'y a jamais rien eu, je me demande, je me fais peut-être des idées mais c'est curieux; elle m'invite régulièrement à déjeuner, me dit toujours que le mariage, c'est emprisonnant sauf si on sait être discret.Je précise que cette personne est mariée.

Il est récurrent de lire dans les médias, à propos de tel ou tel personnage célèbre : Est-il Momosexuel ?       Si être Momosexuel, c'est préférer être avec des hommes et coucher éventuellement avec eux, alors dans ce cas, il est possible de répondre par l'affirmative ou la négative à la question posée.       Si être Momosexuel c'est définir son destin par rapport à une sexualité exclusive et organiser son existence afin de la satisfaire, la réponse est beaucoup moins évidente.

20080918083044AAVfcpW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	C'est un bout de saucisson qui a tué notre liaison, qu'en pensez-vous ?	Voilà, ce matin, alors que je me coupais les ongles de doigts de pied au bureau, je me suis rappelé d'une petite amourette que j'avais eu avec une petite beauté du désert. Elle s'appelait Leila.      J'avais rencontré cette belle kabyle, lors d'une visite au musée Rodin à Paris, pendant l'automne. (en fait, j'attendai là-bas une autre superbe femme, mais elle n'est jamais venue, elle était décédée durant le trajet, d'un accident de Velib).      Cette belle étudiante aux Beaux-Arts, s'était arretée devant une magnifique statue représentant Apollon (bon moi, c'est plut?t la taille du Mandrain du Belatre qui m'a interloqué !"   J'ai tout de suite entamé la conversation avec elle, en commen?ant par le thème de l'art et finissant par celui de la sexualité entre personnes d'origines différentes.      Bref, nous nous sommes revus au moins onze fois, (j'm'en suis tapé des ampoules, à arpenter les couloirs de musées à la con tout en ayant un air faussement passionné en machouillant mes branches de lunettes et m'esclaffer (ex: "mmmmh, magnifique ! quelle finesse!") sur chaques oeuvres, où les beaux yeux noirs de Leila pouvaient se poser.      A un moment, j'ai abandonné quelques secondes Leila, pretextant un appel professionnel mais en réalité je pétais la dalle, et la berbère, de confession musulmane était en plein ramadan.   Ne voulant point la heurter, je me suis discretement rendu à un petit bistrot pour me taper un bon gros camembert-saucisson avec un ballon de rouge.      Je revins un quart d'heure plus tard, vers l'objet de mes désirs, et je commence à prendre Leila entre quatre yeux, lui déclarant ma flamme. Celle-ci hésitante me sourit et me dit:   -"Comme tu es gentil Trouflard et que tu respectes mes convictions, je veux bien juste t'embrasser mais c'est tout!"   C'est un bon début me dis-je (mon professeur de Math, Monsieur Boulard disait souvent en cours, voyant les amoureux de la classe: "pelle roulée... prête à tirer"!      Nous commen?ons à nous embrasser langoureusement, les langues s'enroulent tendrement, nos baves se mélangent (tel les deux océans se confrontant au cap Horn), nos dents s'entrechoquent...puis...PATATRAC... Leila me repousse subitement, et retire alors de sa bouche, un minable mais gros bout de gras de saucisson qui s'était détaché de ma dent creuse durant la frénétique galoche.      Bref, le passe le reste... crachat dans l'oeil et insultes en arabe devant une centaines d'amateurs d'art me condamnant d'un regard noir.      Ridiculisé et ebobé, je repars en route vers mon domicile en taxi où passe à la radio, la bien connue chanson de Michel Sardou (le long sanglots..des musulmanes..).       Bon et vous, pensez-vous que la différence culturelle peut-être un frein dans une relation sentimentale ?      Merci d'avance !

I want to go, because i'd really like to get to know him better, but i'm not sure if I want to be more than friends. So, I don't want him, or other people, to start calling us a couple yet. How can I make it sort of clear to him and to others that we're  not officially an item? Also, I haven't ever done much dating, so my parents freak out if I mention going to the movies with a guy. They automatically think that he's some kind of sicko-rapist. And they wouldn't believe me when I tell them that this guy is nothing more than a friend. Oh, also, this guy is a year older than me.

Ive always dated white guys so its not like its an issue or anything lol but I want to be sure he is interested in me before i say or do anything..       what should i do next time i see him in class?

20090204130956AAs20NO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? I am confused?	Sorry about the annoying 1337-esque punctuation, it was too short. =P   Okay.    So I like this guy. He's a big nerd and I think nerds are really cool. =)    The thing is, I don't know if he fancies me back. He probably thought I was with my ex still BUT we broke it off a week ago. Abaid, this kid, came over and asked if i was single and I said yes. He's gay, chill out. I'm not a wh0re.    ANYWHOSE.    We talked all through PE about different stuff and we agree on so many things and we both don't care if the other disagrees. I'm an anarchist, he's a socialist. I don't care and neither does he. Ever since this one science class where we had a no-laughing contest and he lost, we've gone from the odd word to full-fledged conversations about anything at any given time.       Does he like me or is he just interested in my opinions?

20081114134042AACP6m9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think of a wife who is pratically trying to hook her husband up with her best friend?	Because she lost her entire libido after her second child.      Real Story: A week ago, i was at my local hangout and there was a guy there I know. Pretty handsome dude. Anyhow, he was there with this lady who I assumed was his wife. Nope. It was her best friend and they both went on to tell me that his wife has told them over and over again that it is OK if he sleeps with her friend because she's not into it anymore. Just doesn't care about it anymore. The guy told me when the friend went to the bathroom that the wife hasn't been intimate with him in 7 months he still can't bring himself to do it, though he admits he is going crazy. They even made out right there infront of me, tongue and all.      I'm like WHAT!!      Anyways, what's your take?      Should a guy sleep with his wife's good friend if she's given her permission and if she's not interested in doing it anymore?       What's a guy to do? They have kids, btw.

20090204055148AA6fgN6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please help: Marriage at stake?	Right now we are at the phase where we just acting up like friends. No emotion. I feel awful. We argue a lot. My life is like a movie chalte chalte -Hindi Movie (I know it is funny but this is the best way to explain).   HIstory: I married a white guy. My parents are not talking to me any more.I went to Pakistan to attend my sister's wedding. My parents acted that they are all fine with my marriage and baby. They took my passport and everything and arranged my marriage to someone else (while I am already married) They begged me to go to Pakistan because it is my sister wedding. I thought my parents are not going to hurt me since I am pregnant. Since I thought that it is my sister wedding and my husband was in military so he didn't go but I suppose to come back withing couple weeks.My husband went there to get me. Because of loss of baby there is a big stress between us. Here in States I don't have any Indian/Pakistani friends because either they don't wanna be with me or their family doesn't like me. (I will be the bad influence on them). Of everything happened to me I feel like I don't have any reasons to live. I am getting crazy. I feel bad that I act like insane when we have any argument. Guess I am scared that he is going to leave me. He said to me that he is financially dependent on me right now( I am working and he is starting his business) and after we get out of debt together we will see if our relationship is going to work. He doesn't wanna be with me anymore. We been through a lot together and I know I messed up his life pretty bad. Plus I don't any anybody. We have been married for 1 yr and half. Please tell me on what to do. I Love him a lot. I would die if he leaves me. I know he loves me too. What to do.

20090204173802AAJFgbV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Uhmm this guyy....... ??***?	Okay so i rescently met this guy at my new school. Hes really good looking, tall and everything i like in a guy. we always talk on msn, and sometimes in person. hes never shy with anyone, but he seems shy to come and talk to me, he likes when i go up to him. hes always making fun of me in a joking way, kindof like kindergarten. he asks me who i like on a daily basis, but wont tell me who he likes ! he gave me hints .. just letters in the girls name that he likes. and all the letters were in my name, he didnt give all of the letters obviouslyy... . he really wants me to go to dances with him tooo. but do you think he actually likes me or is just being friendly? what are some ways i could get him to like me or figure out if he does or not :)? were 15 !!
20090204151434AAe1xe7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's going on with him?	Alright, this might be kind of long, so thanks in advance if you read this. I'm kind of confused, I don't know what's going on with this guy. It kind of a long story, so I'll try to make it short.       We used to fool around on webcam, and fooled around once in 'real' life. We're pretty close, talking and that, but only online. We're in the same class and grade and homeroom in school, we used to talk a little. Like, he used to copy my homework or ask for help. A few weeks ago, we decided not to fool around on cam anymore. Some stuff happened between us, mainly me kinda liking him, but I stopped, and now I don't like him anymore, and he knows.       Lately, in school, he doesn't talk to me. I think all he'll ask me what I got on whatever exam or what class we got next, and that's only sometimes. Every now and then in class, he used to catch my eye and whisper something at me, but he doesn't even look at me anymore, barely.       He talks to my best friend, a lot. Too much, almost. Like, he'll ask her for the homework help, and everything like that. Like, yesterday, for example. Me and my friend were in the library, and he came in, and said: "Hey, (my friend), what was on the interview?". He knew I'd done my interview, he looked at me when I came in the classroom. He only asked her. He didn't even acknowledge the fact I was there. When he was leaving, he glanced at me, really quickly. In career, he went to the bathroom, and on his way out, looked at me just before he shut the door. When he came in, I looked up casually, like to see who it was, and I seen him glance in my direction, but I couldn't see his eyes.       He talks to my best friend a lot, and never, never, to me. I want to know if any of you have an idea of what could be going on with him. I mean, before, we weren't the best of friends or anything, but we spoke a scattered time, and now we never do. Also, we used to talk a lot on msn, now we almost never do. I don't get him. I wonder what's on the go with him. I don't understand. Thanks in advance, I really hope someone can give me an idea of what's going on. Thanks.

This upset me a bit, so I decided not to talk to L or C all day,   Then at the end of the day, L texts me asking him to call him, and says that us not talking all day makes his day crap.   I confronted L and said what C said, and apparently C is lying.    My friends said that C must be jealous when I talk to him, could it be true?   What else could it be?

Since March 2008, I have been having a strong Crush (well it is much, much, much more than a crush, because a crush is when you just fancy someone, well I am desperate and serious about this one) on Miranda Cosgrove from Nickelodeon (she's also a singer).       She's 15 and I'm 14. She lives in L.A and I'm in England. And when I grow up I really want to get married to her more than anything else in the world. I am a Sikh so I hope there is nothing wrong with that. I love her so much that I wont even dare look at any other girl in my school.      I am hoping to become a WWE Superstar and work for WWE when I grow up, and somehow find her and date her (I want her to be my girlfriend) and then I DESPERATELY, DESPERATLEY, DESPERATELY, want to get married to her. Now I need some extremely awesome advice on this. I dont just want to hear this ' Just ask he for it'. This aint about ****** or anything but I just wanna be with her when I grow up. Also, I need some advice on how to avoide being heartbroken when she's with another guy. I also need to impress her by playing guitat because she play's Guitar.      Thanks people,

I think it is because I am short. I have been told im cute quite a bit so I don't think I am ugly. Plus I am not all about sex. Bear in mind the girls I ask out are like 5'2. What do I do when even short girls want a tall guy?

20081112231204AA6ITEM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Madly in love with an indian boyfriend whom will have no future with me?	I m very madly in love with an indian guy. He also loves me equally. But a few weeks after we started our relationship, he told me clearly that one day he has to marry a girl his parents choose. (According to their culture parents usually choose bride or groom for the children). He said he made his promise to his mother a few years b4. It really breaks my heart bcoz he is all i want. I really love him so much and I really want him for the whole life. It hurts me so much to know that i can't have him forever. He said he too wants me but he's trying to control his feelings.. I have been feeling so sad thinking when he's gonna leave me. When i started to meet him, i knew that he is the ONE. We match each other perfectly and he is the one i have been looking for. I had been in a very bad relationship b4 him. So when i met him, he was too good to be true. I can't imagine the thought of losing him one day and he would marry someone else other than me. I really want him for life. He's the greatest guy i ve ever met. Do you know what should I do? Its really hard coz i see him everyday and I would look at him and it pains me to see this is the man i love whom i can't have. (FYI we work in the same place). What should I do? I don't want to force him to do anything too.

She lives 5 hrs away and we ended up giving each other our virginity. Well on Sept 25 things started to get really rocky.. then she said she was moving away further and basically dumped me telling me to move on. Well I did love her.. and I was in so much pain.. so I found another girl who's personality is much better.. and I dont know.. I just really like this girl. Well my EX all of a sudden comes back.. and I made the mistake of telling her that "I love you" blah blah blah.. up until today I told her I was seeing someone else.      I have had trust issues with my ex.. shes 17 and I'm about to be 19.. but she told me shes pregnant with my child and she was crying so hard on the phone. She wants me back but I dont know what I want. This NEW girl that I met.. I really REALLY like her and she lives CLOSE.. but shes leaving for the military for 6 months..

I don't mean to be rude or cruel      The new girl   -Awesome personality   -Lives closer   -Smart      I am so confused.. I don't use girls.. but my ex came back in when I was seeing someone else..
20081113212737AABOGmD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know him anymore?	Basically this is what happened, i broke up with my Ex boyfriend about 3 months ago.At first i thought it was all about how i felt i didn't deserve him and we were going to different schools...and other things..but i realize..that..well...im going through depression. So that was why i needed to work on ME first. How can you love another when you cannot even love yourself you know? We have been together for a Year. A few days when we broke up, he goes and has another GF. And it was like wth? All of what we had was for nothing.Then he broke up with her because he is subbosly "still in love with me" we don't talk anymore. My friends tell me, that he was going to wait a month. But then.....he goes and get with her. Saying that he loves her and all. Basically he said tha ti am part of the past now and the he doesn't want to hurt over me...and he is just being..a jerk. It is not him..like....he was a good guy...not like anyone i have ever met..and it is stupid because it is a long distance relationship and says "she is the one" ...i don't know what to do with him..like...what could be the reason he is doing such a thing. He made me suffer so much.I wasn't myslef anymore because of him. I am over our break up but i am still pissed at him. And i hear it is bad holding grudges but..i don't know? what do you think?

20081114141334AAQbXzO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some relationship advice please!?	I've been in a relationship with a girl for almost a year now, we get on great, and all has been good, until about 3 months ago when she told me she loved me, i didn't feel i could say the same back and i felt so awkward, i didn't want to lead her on and I tried to explain how i felt.          This will only be my second serious relationship and the first one didn't end well, me and my ex have a 3 yr old daughter and she basically ran off with another guy 3 years into our relationship and left me absolutely gutted. i was upset for months afterwards and also found out that she had cheated with other guys earlier on in the relationship.      It was about about 2 years after that ended that i met my current g/f, she is amazing and we get on so well, i try to show her how much i care in the things i do for her. In the last little while things haven't been so great we don't talk quite as much and she is always asking me how i feel towards her. I really like her, care so much for her and enjoy spending time with her but i just don't know if i love her. I said that at some point in the future i would like to move away. She keeps talking about moving away together and recently mentioned marriage, I'm not ready for that and i'm begining to have doubts. I don't want to upset her or hurt her feelings but i don't want to break up with her either.       can anyone help me with some advice please!

20081114192503AAdHDzJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do??? Please help?	Okay, so I am in high school. and im an outcast who only has one friend and she is my best friend (yea im a dude). We're neighbors that have only known eachother for about 3 months, and we grown to like eachother like more than friends. When she had her last boyfriend she said that I would be next. So she said she could see us getting married and she straight up told me she loved me. Then she breaks up with him and goes out with a dude who likes her for her looks, and she has like fallen in love with him. And i honestly hate it when she talks about him. So today on the bus she gets a text saying that he wants to do it with her and she was in AWE and said that she would happily. When i heard that that just tore me apart. Once I got home, i went to my room and balled my eyes out. Especially since she said she loved me, that just made it worse. I still love her and would do anything for her but this is just killing me. I actually wanna kill myself right now. If someone handed me a gun, i would pull the trigger. What do i do? Please help....

20081115184745AA4G98p	Family & Relationships;Family	Child support and his rights to my child?	 am 26 years old and 8 moths pregnant. My husband ran out on me one month after we were married for another girl. almost 9 years younger than himself. He left me and my 3 year old with a years lease on the house and no way to pay bills. He is living with his mother, his gay friend, and his bi girlfriend. His mother is a prostitute (AngelWithAKink2.com Main Page ) show you the proof. His girlfriend has threatend me and my unborn child. And john is hanging out with drugies, wich all of them mother included are in to drugs. When john and i were togeather he was not like that at all he was clean, had a job, and was doing well. But since he got with Sheila (btw same first and middle name as me) he has become trash. His bathing habbits are just gross now, he has a bath once a week if that, never shaves or cuts his hair. wears the same clothing a week at a time. When his girlfriend threatend me and my unborn child john knew about it and did nothing, in fact i asked him if she knew that i was pregnant when she wrote that and he said yes that she knew. What she said was she was in the military and has been trained to kill killers and i had beter watch myself. For one she was only in boot camp for one week before she was dishonrably discarged (pretending to have a heart murmer) she was medicaly examined and no illness found. This girl has also been stalking me to no end. Oh now down to the reason why i am here, i do not want my husband to have rights to the child but i want him to pay child suport what can i do. I do not want my child to be anywhere near him his family or friends because i really think that they would hurt her or his girlfriend molest her.

20090204131144AApztZm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He says he wants to date me but still has feelings for his ex of three years?	I have strong feelings for this guy I met a month ago.  We met in college and began talking.  He calls me every day and text me when he can't talk on the phone.  We spend alot of time together, talking and even making out.  The relationship is not physical because I told him I was a virgin and he said he is going to remain abstinate until marriage.       On several occasions he has told me that he likes me alot but has never admited to wanting to "date" me, however he has mentioned earlier this week that we were going to go on a date soon.        I have met his parents and his friends and they all seem to like me.  He likes to come over to my dorm and just cuddles with me.  But before you begin to think that this relationship is about to blossom into something more, my guy calls me today and says he needs to talk to me.        He says on the phone that he really wants to date me but he is still thinking about his exgirlfriend of three years.  They broke up a while back and he even dated someone else after that for 8 months which ended up horrible after both cheated on each other and my guy going back to his "ex" (the one that he is talking to me about now).  He has been single for about a month and a half prior to meeting me.        Time and time he has assured me that he is not going to get with any other girl and that I had nothing else to worry about.  When he talked to me on the phone today about his "feelings" for his ex, he said that he wasn't going to go back to her, that he was confused about why he felt his old feelings for her, and that he was going to try and get over her.          She lives half way across the country now so I'm not worried about anything but yet I am still concerned.  I hate that he feels things for her but I understand that they have a past.  It sucks for me because I think he needs to move on.  She is not here and I am.  He has told her about me and she gotten very mad.       Should I be worried?  Does this look like a disaster waiting to happen?  Am I going to get turned down?  I just think he likes me too much to turn me away but I still am not sure.  He is being honest with me and I appreciate that but I am still heart broken.  Does our relationship look promising?  He told me this now because he said us dating right now would not work.  I told him he needs to make up his mind.          Please somebody help me.  I need some honest advice that could help me.  Note that I think I am falling for this guy.  I feel like I'm being screwed over but I know he told me his feelings to protect me from his uncertain heart.  I'm extremely depressed and need advice.  Please someone help me.

I've already told her I like her in fact, a while back, and didn't get a response. but she ( we ) continue to stare at each other. Last week, I was walking to class, and I saw her walking with her boyfriend, so I was like cool, I'll just move on, no problem. She walked right past me, so I'm only guessing she knows I saw her. Anyway, this week, I had the worst cold maybe I've ever had, and I had my head down in class, and sure enough, every time I looked up, those blue eyes were looking right at me. What the hell does she want from me, and what should I do?

20090204140913AApnUCm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Met this woman and had one date a month ago that went ok?	She usually returns my calls and a couple of times has called me first.  We are pretty busy and we can't see each other often.  The last few days though she hasn't returned my call and I wonder if I should even bother anymore.  She is on Facebook and one of her friends posted a comment about them "playing the (ski) fields" and no getting attached to soon - there was also a reference about "studman" which may or may not have anything to do with me.  The girl deleted it from her face book page in a matter of hours.    I know that she is divorced but that ended months ago (if this matters).    Is she interested or not in seeing me again?  Should I give up since she is so busy?
20090204142110AA5lk98	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you have done?	I do security at Best Western (a major hotel chain). A few days ago at work, when I was in the main lobby of the hotel, a hot Spanish chick who was intoxicated came over to me and started flirting with me in Spanish. It was hot! I know quite a bit as well, so I played along. A few hours later, she showed up again and started flirting/teasing me again by saying stuff like, "yo te queiro uno noche"...clearly she wanted it. So I took her to her room, and got a beejay. She liked it, I liked it. She then passed out, and I left. I haven't talked to her since. Is this a bad thing?      Note 1: She was not a prostitute. She was an employee from her company's party which took place in our conference center.   Note 2: I'm not worried about cameras. I know where they are.

20090204145419AAa1icN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can sex in a marriage be completely revamped?	i I have been with my husband for almost 8 years. The last two years, sex has been an empty experience for me. I have sex whenever he wants but do not get remotley turned on. I used to make a lot of effort in sex, outting in al my emotions and constantly trying to rev things up talking about fantasies. He was never really that forthcoming, but sex was ok.  Now I can't out in so much effort, actually I rarely put any effort in except to initiatate sex. I get so upset I used to cry but now I guess I have accepted it at one level. Is it normal in a marriage to feel nothing towards my husband during sex? I love him but may be I am not in klove with him? Will this pass? It has been 2 years and I haven't had an orgasm from sex with him, and find my self dreaming at night of sexual encounters with other men, then feeling guilty upon waking and further disapointed.

20090204150157AAJHx75	Family & Relationships;Friends	A girl I know stole my iPod and won't admit she took it. Help!?	Well I go to Boys and Girls Club everyday afterschool because my parents have jobs till 5. Well…Usually I don’t have anything to do except do homework and read, so I bring my iPod so that I could enjoy doing homework by listening to my songs. Well this ‘friend’ that I’ve had over the summer wanted to listen to it (she did this before), well this ‘friend’ is known very well to steal and to lie about everything. Well, I thought she wouldn’t leave the room with it so I gave it to her but told her to give it back. She left the room listening to it so I asked one of my friends (real) to watch her cause she might want to pocket it when I’m not there. Well…I had to type up a script for my theatre group so I had to go to the computer lab. I realized right in the middle of it, that this is so late in the afternoon that she would have left already, I hurried back to my binder to see if she left it there, and it wasn’t there. The staff that was always across my binder and a couple of my friends around my backpack told me that she wasn’t there to give it back, and the staff told me that she saw her leaving with it. The friend that was watching had to do something for a couple minutes, and that’s when she ‘supposedly’ left. Well, since she already left, I went home hoping that she’ll give it back tomorrow. Well today is tomorrow, and I asked her about it, and she told me she left it on the pocket of my binder. Well there’s nothing there. Everyone saw her leaving with it and as I’ve said before, she lies a LOT, and steals a LOT more. Now she’s making up excuses that could sound convincing but I know they are not true. Even my brother knows that she stole it. What should I do? I just want to outsmart her and embarrass her for stealing from a friend. (Oh, just btw, I’m good at lying & acting, that’s why I’m in the theatre group, so if that could help me…please tell me!) I told her ‘sister’ (another LIE) that my iPod is missing and her ‘sister’ is the last person seen with and even her ‘sis’ that knows her very well told her that if she does have it, then give it back. PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS. I REALLY WANT MY iPOD BACK! All I want to do is to outsmart, embarrass her and get my iPod back. Thanks guys!

20090204151157AAolCv4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not totally over my ex. Am I ready to date again?	I am finding it really hard to get over the last guy I was seeing. I have known him for over 10 years, and we were seeing each other for six months this time round. We were dating for two years from 13-16 too.      We split up beginning of january, but I still think about him all the time, and really want him back, although I know it will never work for several reasons.      I have also been in a long term relationship before him, which started in my teens after I split up with the first one, and I broke up with him 18 months ago.       I have never don the dating thing, with the long term bf we were so young we didn't start off 'dating' as such, and with the other guy, again, we were young first time round, and this latest relationship we did a few dates but I already knew him so wasn't as nerve wracking as someone new.      Now I am truly single, I have this guy at work interested in me. The problem is, I compare all men to my most recent ex, and they can't live up to him in my eyes. I am so picky because I am looking for a replacement for him I think.      I don't know whether to go on a date with the guy from work, because I don't feel my heart's in it. On the other hand, maybe it would be good for me to 'get out there'?      And do you think stronger feelings could develop with him over time, or do I need to get my ex out of my head first? I just have no idea how long that'll take!      Thanks :)

20090204153056AAcIltL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when your partner is way more into you than you are into him?	I dated this guy around three years ago but after two months we broke things off for personal reasons... Now we recently met up again and after talking for a few months strictly as friends, he asked me for a second opportunity and I accepted.   The problem is... Sometimes I feel suffocated because he doesn't stop saying he loves me, and honestly I don't feel the same way.   It's much too soon for that- it hasn't even been a week! Sure, we've been friends for a long time and in our previous relationship feelings were strong... But that was three years ago and during those three years a lot occurred.   I've tried talking to him about it- why the rush? But he just doesn't get it. I like him a lot, he's a sweet guy but I don't love him. I do care for him, and a lot but there's a difference between that and love. Love takes much more time and patience. I want things to work out between us and more than anything I don't want to hurt his feelings. He really doesn't deserve it. I just want him to take things slow. What should I do?   I've already tried telling him all this but he keeps insisting he loves me and I feel uncomfortable, not knowing how to respond to that.

20090204165840AAKqHA7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS AND GUYS! ANSWER!!?	Okay...last year at my school i metthis cute guy that I really like. We were really good friends and we would talk and have fun together. This year all of that changed.I started talking a lot to his best friend. I also talked to his brother. They both like me. And so he and his best friend hanged out and they tell me they wish I was with them. I was surprised and so I tried talking to him but he ignores me. He saw me at school that day and winked and said hi to me and then on msn he wouldnt answer me. He told me that he will delete me if i didnt stop talking to him. What the hell is wrong with him?!?! I really like him but I don't know what to do!! He also flirts a lot with me before he started ignoring me.   P.S He has a gf but their kind of not together.

20090204163855AAfApK9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can Anyone Give Advice?	Hey there world,       I need a little advice, maybe some two cents would help.      I'm currently dating this guy Alex since Halloween. He likes me a lot and I'm happy when I'm with him.   The only problem is that my best friend likes him a lot. She liked him before me.    My question is that if i should end it with alex and not even risk my friendship, or should i just tell my friend and hope for the best?      Because i know, she would be really mad if we "started dating" even though were already dating, and I feel really guilty...      Any Advice??      P.S our friendship would never be the same

I feel really bad,    I made a fake on myspace after one of my friends said how much fun it was when she made one,    I really didnt think I was going to use it much, but I added this one guy, and we became really good friends.

Would you be understanding if I told you I was a fake? Would you still talk to me? Do you think He will be understanding?       Please answer all questions.
20090204164022AAOIJwC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this is weird?	The coronation dance at my school is coming up and I was talking to my girlfriend about going. She said she wasn't sure whether she wanted to go, but would let me know. When I asked her about getting her a corsage and all that stuff if we did go, she said she didn't want me to get one because then she would have to get me whatever the thing girls get guys is called, and all of it is just a waste of money because they're uncomfortable and just eventually die. I thought not getting them for each other was kinda weird considering we've been together for awhile. What do you think?

I hope u don′t be mad with me       Ps. Sorry about my english'          Now, she says she is married but has asked a couple of questions about me.

20090204165551AA5kRB7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Calling all ppl!!! i need your advice, and I need it fast! I only have 24 hrs! It's about a girl!?	Now, this is going to be long. Lately, the new semester has begun and the new schedules roll in. I finished AP Gov and Econ honors and switched em for a block of weight lifting. It's been 2 weeks since I started weight lifting and a girl caught my eye. I wonder how, cuz she isn't that great looking, but it happened. I ignored it and just acted myself. It turns out i got her attention as well. She is a friend of my friend, and now she became my friend. I could tell when she had a nervous feeling when I talked to her (I just can tell, I think its a gift). She is very obvious. She one day asked if I was going to dance in the school, I said maybe, maybe not (dances aren't my thing, especially those with western themes. I can't square dance.). OK, then she moved very fast. She gives me a note. Now, I'm going to show you what it says (for those who can read in between the lines. The words in parenthesis are my comments on the letter):      Hi Luis (thats me),   I'm not sure if I spelled your name right (she did), sorry if I didn't. I know that we have only been in this class for almost 2 weeks now together (the "together" says something), but you seem like a really nice guy, (This is where I thought "here it comes") One that would be really courteous and polite and fun to be around. I was just curious if you would ever go out with me. (I expected that) I hope you're not freaked out about the height difference, (Dudes and dudettes she's like 4-5 in. taller than me, and that thought has entered my mind. it shows that she wants me though) I really hate being tall, I seem to tower over everybody. Sorry if I am being too forward (very forward, its been only 2 weeks!), I would just love to have someone to be with to finish out my senior year. (this last sentence really throws me off, is she asking cuz she's lonely? Or does she really want me?)      Your weight lifting buddy,   (Her name will be ommitted. and yes she drew a happy face there)           :)      Now, this note says alot and confuses me. I want to say yes, but I'm tempted to say no. I've never had a girlfriend before, but the last sentence throws me off. I really think I'm looking too into it. I want to say no because I don't beleive a relationship is made when there is love. Also, I'm afraid of being a terrible boyfreind (I can't drive, I'm poor, things like that) I really want to say yes, because I have this gut feeling to say yes. I never had a girlfriend cuz I never got the balls to ask one out, but i feel brave today. What should I do? Your opinion really matters to me, so please be nice and help a guy out. Thanx for your time guys!
20090204165711AAZGmRd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it odd that I've never dated anyone at 15?	I know some might say of course not, but really, when was your first date? I'm a 15 year old guy, btw, and I've never had the guts to ask a girl out, but I kind of subconsciously tell myself that there's no point in dating until at least one of us is 16, then we can drive ourselves to the movies/restaurant/etc. without our parents driving us around.      And I suppose my self confidence is a bit low, seeing as how I'm going to describe myself as pale, dark haired, and sort of geeky lol. I have also been told I have a big head, but then again, look at George Lopez, lol. And I'm in the band, not in any sports(dropped out of basketball), so obviously I'm not the most popular guy at school, and unfortunately I'm not really making up for any of it in smarts right  now, cuz my grades are currently pretty suckish(C's and B's probably.)      But I've never had a kiss from a girl other than family, but in a family way, not a sexual love kind of way, lol.      So what I pretty much want to know is:      1. When was your first date?   2. Girls, do you prefer a guy who asks you out, or do you care who arranges the date?   3. Girls, could you ever see yourself accepting your bf as a crossdresser? (Had to get some LGBT in there somewhere, lol, :P, I am straight though)   4. And what do you think of band members?   5. And is it legal for me to post a pic of myself on Y!A or should I just link to Facebook or something?      Ok, thanks.

Then i got worried and sent him a message asking him if he was kidding and he said he was. but he still kept flirting and so i sent him a message asking him out and didn't reply so when i asked him about it he said didn't get a message.

20090204170618AAPGwWP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm uncomfortable with his attraction to my sister!?	I have been seeing this guy for a few months now.  We are both really committed to finishing our degrees (I'm an undergrad and he is a grad student) and we have decided that our schoolwork has first priority over our relationship.  This gets tricky sometimes because I don't "understand" if I am his girlfriend or not??  But we do really like each other... Anyway, the other night, he told me that he saw my sister at the store one day and that he thinks she is really hot.  He didn't talk to her,and he has never met her, but he recognized her as my sister from some photos I showed him. He asked me what I would think if he called her and possibly went out with her.  My sister is really beautiful and all my life people have compared the two of us.  It's a very sore spot with me.  When I reacted negatively to the idea of him dating her, he said I was being selfish.  Am I?  Then he said that she was prettier than I am.  I didn't like to hear that either. Then he said thatI should be happy that he is complimenting my sister and not be so selfish... I just don't think I could stand it if he is dating my sister, but since we are not in a serious relationship... I guess I cannot make demands??
20090204170723AAgJ2yf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just sex/booty call or more?	Just met a guy and went out for first date monday night, I ended up spendin the night and we slept together.

Also, my b-day is this sunday and v-day is next saturday. If he takes me out on a date for both does that show its possibly more than just a booty call/sex or would it not mean anything?

20090204171150AA4tubx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do I want to beat the living crap out of a bully I haven't seen in over 20 years?	He was your textbook sadistic, cruel teenage bully.    I thought I would see him at the 20 year reunion, but he was a no show just like the other bullies.       I haven't been bullied in over 20 years. The few who tried were beaten very quickly. I'm sure I'm now bigger and tougher than he ever was. I'm a college graduate, black belt, and ex military.      Still, he's that one guy I want to track down, and go off on. It bothers me that he got away with such viscious cruelty.   I tried to be the good boy back then by not tattling on anyone. I was also afraid of getting suspended for fighting back. Back then I never thought I could sue the school and get the principal fired if they dared suspend me for simple self defense.      Does anyone else have bully revenge fantasies? Can someone talk me out of going after this punk? If I find him, I'll cover myself legally by letting him make the first threat. Perhaps all I need is to have him be the one who walks away?

20090204172328AAto1P5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when a guy likes you but you don't like him?	There's this guy and I think he likes me (I don't like and have never likes him), but he's starting to really get on my nerves.  He was just nice at first, but now he's like stalkerish.  He's ALWAYS trying to be around me.  It's so frustrating!  What should I do?  I don't want to be too mean.
20090204172919AAE0QKz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Next step with boyfriend?	Okay, so basically I've been dating this amazing guy for a year and things are still going good. We're 16. We've taken everything really slowly, like we were friends for 4 years before going out, we didn't rush into kissing or anything, and just stuff like that. We've gotten to 2nd base. I always wanted to stop there but he's willing to go to 3rd base. (We're both waiting for marriage for sex and we've already talked about this several times.) There has never been any pressure from him, but i recently started thinking maybe I should go to 3rd base. I do love him and I want to experience it with him. I am a Christian, so my views kinda influence me on this. I know, getting where I already got with him hasn't been too holy, but 3rd base would be the same, right? It's not sex and I am definitely not going there (all the way) until after marriage. So what should I do? I really want to do this for him, and for myself, but I don't want to regret it later. Help! Thanks in advance!
20090204172923AAHtsIx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over this guy?	Okay he says he likes me and cares for me but i want to forget him and i have my reasons. He's really sweet and cute so its really hard. And everytime i tell myself i dont like him anymore he comes and gives me a hug and talks to me. Omg i can't believe it's this hard to forget someone. He thinks im mad at him about something, because he was being "caring" and to make myself get over him i made it into this huge thing to make him think im mad at him. I know that seems stupid but i really need to stop liking him seriously.

20090204173030AAgsmTf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to ask her out, but I don't know how.....?	I know its asked all the time but please help? There is a girl at school who is without a doubt the most amazing girl I have ever met, and she is also the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. Last semester we had two classes together, all of which we sat close to each other and talked and laughed and such. We just changed semesters, so our classes are different, and I am in none of her classes. However, I see her in the halls and at lunch (i dont sit with her because she is surrounded by her friends...it would be embarrassing..) Every time we make eye contact she smiles and blushes, and we talk online a ton and when we can in the halls. I am totally hooked and think shes awesome, but unfortunately I have heard that she has strict parents when it comes to dating and stuff, so I don't know what to do. I really like her and want to go out with her, and I don't think she wouldnt want to, its just I dont know if I should..... Should I? i know im sorry it was long but i really need help! thanks guys =]

20090204205609AARdqZW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does it seem like  a shortage of men, but some ppl say it's somebody out there for everybody. I never?	understood that. Can anyone explain that to me.  Do that mean if it's a shortage of men and everybody out there for somebody do that mean some women would be married to that man then when he get a divorce the other lady would have him. Is that how the saying goes somebody out there for everybody.
20090204181109AAuZVw9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he might ask me to the dance?	I've liked this guy for a really long time, and I think he might like me but I'm not sure. He's always looking at me - when he talks, even when he's talking to someone else; and sometimes during class - he blushes around me, he tries to get me to laugh. That kind of thing.       The school dance is coming up, and he's been talking about it a lot to other people in front of me. Like to this one guy we were trying to convince to go sit over at this one table he said, "Yeah, go over there and ask those girls to the dance." It was kind of out of the blue.       Do you think he might ask me? :]

20090204183300AASArlJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Thin Line between Love & Hate?	How do you nicely tell someone that it's best if we go your separate ways?  I don't want to hurt his feelings but I'm through with all the arguing and bickering.  He's not even my boyfriend, just my f**k buddy, and we argue like we are married and to me it's just stupid. In the beginning everything was okay but now it's almost as if he is trying to change me into the kind of woman he wants me to be before deciding if he wants a serious relationship.  It's been a year now and if he hasn't decided by now what he wants then tough luck.       I'm 25 years old and he is 48.  He believes that because he's so much older then me he's more mature...however I don't measure someone's maturity based on the number of candles on their birthday cake. We haven't had sex in months, I thought this would make him go away but obviously I was wrong.  So how do I tell him that whatever this is between us is over without destroying his ego? I use to care a great deal about him but now I'm close to hating him.

20090204190342AAcrJwh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife ruined my $65.00 Izod Shirt?	She used bleach  because she dumped all the whites from the hamper in the washer and didn't see my Izod shirt.      Now it's ruined and looks like crap. This shirt was given to me as a gift from a Telecommunications Company I worked for and it has my name monogramed on the sleeves.      All she said to me was it's my fault for putting in the hamper and I say it was her fault for not checking the clothes.      Who's fault is it because I want her to know I was not wrong she was.

I'm a dishwasher, so I get wet all day. Sometimes, when I'm done smoking I'll feel the urge to go, as opposed to leaving my very compfortable position where I risk my boss telling me to do something, I just go in my pants which are already wet, and my apron covers it up anyway. Then I usually spray them down with the hose. Its not like its super gross or anything b/c I usually get off work in an hour after I do this. Then I get in my car and drive around for a few hours, while I smoke. I don't think that theirs a problem with it. Do you?

20090204184617AA8I3Et	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	Mkay, so there's this guy in my drama class that i just officially met this semester. I had seen him around campus before and always thought he was really cute, but never expected it to go anywhere.      Well, now that we're kinda friends, I've been getting to like him a lot more and I've been noticing that he'll do things just to get my attention like sneaking up on me to scare me or making funny faces from across the classroom. We're not really that close - or close enough for him to be casually doing these things at least.      So, maybe I'm over thinking things because I kinda like him, but I really want to know if he likes me. Or kinda does. I mean, we don't know each other that well, so we need to get to know each other better first.      Any opinions?

20090204180440AAcGi7d	Family & Relationships;Friends	HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY PEOPLE SKILLS?	I am in grade 10 (I'm a guy) and whenever i wanna talk to someone new..I never know what to say.   Sometimes I talk to them about school but that conversation always turns out short and awkward.   How do I talk to the people I sit beside?   Also there are some poeple I know from previous semesters but i wan never friends with them.. we basically just know each other's names.   So to sum it up:   What do I talk to the people I sit beside about who I don't know?   What do I talk about the the people I already know?      And overall   HOW DO I IMPROVE MY PEOPLE SKILLS?      Any help would be great!   Thanks in advance!
20090204180058AAxRQ4m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I NEED HELP GETTING A GIRLFRIEND!!!?	Second semester just started a few days ago and I really wanna get my first girlfriend this semester ( I am in grade 10).   The problem is...I don't have great people skills...   Whenever I am around a girl, I don't know what to say to them.   Also, most of the girls in my classes already have a group they hang around with, so I cannot approach them in the halls (some of these groups contain both guys and girls).   Some of the girls I want to talk to, I know from previous semesters (We are not friends or anything...we basically just know each others names..Also, I don't sit beside the girls I know from previous semesters).   Does anyone know how I can approach the girls I don't sit beside without being weird?   How can I be a more funny guy around them (charming funny not stupid funny).   What are some conversation topics I can talk to them about? (please not school...whenever I talk to someone about school it turns really awkward).   When I want to talk to a girl in one of my classes for the first time...What do I say?   Sorry, I don't wanna sound arrogant but my looks are not a problem. I have been called "hot" by girls in the halls, and not in a jokingly manner ( sorry i mentioned that I only said it to help you understand my situation better... I DON'T have a massive ego)   So to sum it up:   How can I be a more charming guy in front of high school girls?   What should I say when I want to talk to a girl I have never met for the first time?   What should I talk about to girls I already know but are not friends with?   How do I approach girls that I do not sit beside in classes if they usually hand around with their "groups"   PS: Please don't say "Just be yourself"   I don't wanna be around mean.. But "myself" is not a shy person that girls don't wanna talk to.   Its my personality that's the problem.   ANY HELP WOULD BE GREAT!   THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!
20090204190429AAgN4EB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When a guy likes a girl for years, will he easily ask her out when he finally gets close with her?	So i've liked this guy for years now, and i'm guessing he has too. We're finally becoming close and i was just wondering whether he'll ever ask me out. I heard that guys refuse/avoid asking out girls whom they've liked for years because they're afraid of losing that girl. Is that true?
20090204190433AA9M41i	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guyyyy trouble? anyone?	okay so i have a fiance ive known him about 3 years.   so yesterday at school i met this guy, we found out we live close by eachother. so he says you want to hang out. im like sure, thinking he means just friends. i told him i have a fiance, he seemed surprised but didnt say much about it. we hung out in town, got some food, etc.    The odd thing was he kept having me meet his friends, family, etc, and totally "showing me off". like bragging about how awesome i am. i felt really uncomfortable about this. He asked if i drink or smoke i said no and he says well your a p***y. and then calls me stupid.       so naturally...im thinking i dont want to hang out with this guy. he thinks hes a bad a** type. So today i ignore his calls. well now im up to a total of 8 calls today. like a stalker. i answer the eigth. he says he wants to hang out with me again. i say im busy. then i tell him that i feel like he wants to be more than just friends. he denies it.      so the question is--- how do i POLITELY tell this guy i dont want to be friends or anything? LIke I dont even want to talk to him?

We havent had sex for awhile because i have been on my monthly cycle and we havent found time to hang out.. but i feel like it ruins the thought of sex when it is always broughten up.. anyone agree...      here is an example:   Me: Did you take your lunch?   Him: Ya 15 minutes   Me: Your getting dicked over their babe. I sent you that job in your       email.    Him:Coll. thanks babe. Wanna get dicked over?   Me: hmmmm?   Him: I mean bent over.

We are both pretty shy...      so at the beginning of the school year (i'm a junior) i decided i'd try to be a little more outtgoing in the boy department so one day in the hall when i passed him i gave him a quick grin.... he got the most confused look on his face... so that made me really embarassed adn now if we pass i try to avoid eyecontact. but the question is what do you think he was thinking -- like just confused why i'd be smiling at him, or like disgusted, or idk ???? and what could i do that is a little less embarassing to make him notice me??

Thanks
20090204182835AAgKIEg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Everyone is saying that I flirt with the guys around me.....?	How do I make them stop? I don't flirt with them. My best friend hates me because all the guys that she likes, are my best friends, and we mess around all the time. I have a lot more guy-friends than girls, and I always lean on them, put my head on their shoulder, touch them, ruffle their hair, hug them, say "I love you", so my friend started getting jealous. Everyone did (a lot of people like my guy-friends). So I stopped doing it, and I told one of my guy-friends, who was worried about people saying that we're dating, that I won't talk to him for a while, but he didn't want me to, so I didn't have a choice. I don't know what to do. I stopped doing that stuff that makes the girls around me offended, but then they said that I need to chance my tone of voice because it is flirtatious... or whatever you call it, but I always talk like that, even with the girls. I don't know what to do. I've known the guys since Kindergarden/1st grade, but whenever I do those kinds of things, and ask my guy-friends if they are bothered that people think we're dating, they say no, and whenever I hug them, say "I love them", etc, they say "I love you" back, and hug me tightly, and the rest to me too. I don't get offended by it. They don't have girlfriends. Why does everyone hate me. I have a person I like. They all know who he is and that he's not good-looking or anything. (and in my opinion, worst than my friends) But why do people keep assuming that I am flirting with someone when I'm not?!!! I've tried all I can, I don't want to play this stupid game of love. My grades are madly slipping and my family is getting more detatched, etc, I don't want to bother doing this, but if I don't, I feel like somehow, it will end up worst. People ask me countless times if I like the guys I sit with, I say no, but they keep asking, day after day, and I get mad and tell them that I don't and never ask me again, but they wont believe me. I DONT LIKE THEM!!!!!!!! THEYRE MY KINDERGARDEN FRIENDS!!!!!! OMG!
20090204183816AAZjSDN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I just say the wrong things to this girl? She turned me down.?	This girl just told me she's not ready for any kind of a relationship and wanted to be just friends. She said she just needs time alone by herself and that she would not keep in touch anymore.      In the spur of the moment and fear of losing her I said something like, "I really like you and will wait until you're ready bcus you're really someone that I've been looking for". After I hung up the phone, I regret saying that because now I look like a clingie idiot. I meant everything that I said because I really like her but I think I should've played it cool. What do you think she's going to think of me now? (Not that it matters anymore since she's not interested in me) Could she have second-thoughts or did I just blow her away?

20060626142006AAf5pLf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hey I still have guy problems help!!!!!!!?	The [same] guy I like the one's that's all shy around me and vice versa, well when he's around my other best [girl] friend (they're like uber close friends too) he acts more relaxed around her than he does around me. He finds it easier to talk to her than he does with me about any and everything. When he's around her he's not all shy like he is around me and I hate it. I want to become his freind before I become his girlfriend [if that makes any sense]. How do I do that?

20090204204638AAh8oFB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is HE sending MIXED messages!!....?????****?	was on msn last Monday and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever"  What does it really mean? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me. Today (Monday), one week later, I got a text from someone saying"hey wats ur schedule like". I asked who it was was, he replied, it was my ex indeed. I said "oh haha we can talk later...".    I went on msn  to talk to him instead of texting back. I kinda don’t wanna see him cuz I know how he is, we met up once before, it went bad. Neways on msn, I asked him first when was good, he said this week was bad, but the following Friday is good. I said I’ll be busy. Then he said “haha, why is it so hard to see you?” I said “why do u wanna see me? He said “cuz I miss u?” Why did he put a QUESTION MARK at the end? He's not sure if he misses me?? Then I told him thr truth how I kinda don’t wanna see him. That I do but I don’t. I asked if he really wants to see me, he said “I do, why else would I ask”. Then I said maybe to the Friday date but for him to ask me again. He said he will. At the end, I said “One more thing, you’ll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P”. Based on the conversation would he say he likes me, has feelings and really wants to see me? Was it bad of me to be honest with him? I went on msn now and he didn’t even say hi, if he REALLY misses me & wants to see me shouldn’t he try more, like talking to me, on msn or phone?? What’s the REAL reason he wants to see me? Just to see me, or does he wanna date again? Should I ask him if he wants to try again? He’s sending mixed messages and its confusing me!!!   BTW we never had sex while dating cuz he knew I wanna save it for marriage, so don't he wants sex.
20090204181230AAhZaFu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does being in shape really matter?	How much does being in shape matter to females?      Such as - low bf%, lean muscle mass, no ***** ****, tight body, no chubby face etc..      Granted being in shape may not be the key to picking up all girls but I'm wondering, how much does it matter? Is it worth it to run, lift and eat well? Spending countless hours in the gym and on the treadmill?      Will a girl who was uninterested because you were fat or obese completely rethink dating or getting with you just because you are in good shape? Of course personality matters and along with being shape comes confidence..but regardless of the subconscious effect (confidence) that being shape has on you...do females look at you more sexually than if you were fat/obese and completely rethink about who you are?

He doesn't want her to work cause he won't watch her 3 year old from a previous relationship.  He and his buddies joke about how she is just so submissive, right in front of her.  She just says "that's how I am."  It's just unbelievable.  Should I be worried about her?  I can't see how this relationship can be good for her.

20060721191218AAJte0L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do you think he walked away?	This guy flirted with me and could only, barely make eye contact with me.  Then he stopped the flirting and just became really friendly.  Making more eye contact.  Seemed like sometimes now on purpose.  The most recent thing he's done is ask me questions.  They're related to my job.  I haven't known the answer. The last time he asked me I talked to my girlfriend that sits near me and was laughing but at myself.  I looked across the room and he saw me laughing.  The next day I felt he ignored me.  A week went by he had been out of the office.  I walked into the room he was talking to my boss about something.  He saw me from a distance and seemed to be eyeing me.  I stopped to talk to a girlfriend his whole body turned toward me.  But as soon as I started to walk toward him and my boss he quickly ended the conversation and walked off.  What was up with this? It's possible he turned to look at someone else.  But still why walk away as soon as I started to approach.

20090204175947AAzuvjF	Family & Relationships;Friends	I had to repost: There's no zest anymore :(?	You know how people get so caught up in life that the happiness that once came so easy disappears? Well you can say I'm there. I was basically depressed for a good 3 years and lost many great friendships. The people that I was once able to laugh with for hours became distant and though we may say hi it's just not the same.      Anyway my 16th birthday is coming up and I have a whole long weekend planned, but I just don't want to miss out on life. Since I'm still under 18, my mother has control and when I mention something fun to do I'm kicked down. I feel so limited in life.       Im rebuilding friendships and trying to get everything back on track now that I'm not so affected by my depression.       So the question: How do you guys keep smiling? How are you totally spontaneous everyday? And how do you and your friends have a bunch of fun?      Cause I need some...
20090204174648AA0lZ4l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	CAPRICORN experience?  I need MAJOR help w/mine!!?	We met at a party 6 months ago-instant connection, only he had a girlfriend. He said he couldn't hang out w/me b/c the urge to cheat was too strong. A couple weeks later, he emails me to let me know they broke up. We start hanging out out a lot, talking on the phone, sending cute texts...it really seemed to be going somewhere.      Then one day I let some jealousy show over other girls talking to him & he freaked out b/c he felt like he was in a relationship again and he wasn't ready. We didn't hang out for over 2 months and then one day he sends me an email letting me know he's finally over his ex. We ended up hanging out and becoming intimate (which we hadn't really done before). He then he invited me on a date and later to spend time alone with him. The only thing is that this time around he's distant. I can't tell if he really likes me and is just afraid of moving too fast or if he thinks I'm ok and doesn't mind having sex with me here and there but he's looking for someone he likes better.      When we're alone, he's so sweet. When we're in public, he treats me like just one of his friends..until he gets drunk, then he's sweet again. I can't figure him out. What does he want from me?        I got so frustrated b/c he didnt' return my text until the next morning that I didn't return his for 4 days, now he's not returning mine.  I just like him so much and I want him to stop playing games.  I guess playing them w/him wasn't the answer either.        I'm lost!  Please help.      Additional Details   I am an Aquarius. (I was born close to the Capricorn cusp though but I have a lot of both characteristics as well as some completely contradicting ones...I'm weird, haha!)

20090204174846AAWlEo4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Chronic cheating I didnt know about?	I've been seeing this guy the last 3 months. After we slept together he started getting really weird and distant saying we were just friends but then hed get confused and jealous if i went out and say we were together.  The other day i was talking to him and he said he had been on a date all weekend. I didnt beleive him and shrugged it off but then he called me the next day and he told me he had been seeing someone else and that i needed to get on with things.  That took me right off guard. and apparantly in the last month we had been still seeing eachother, hed been cheating on me with this other girl.  I was curious about him saying this and didnt believe it so i talked to his sister whom i went to highschool with. Apparantly hes had a history of this and he cheats chronically on girls. and leaves them for the next.  Now im hearing about how much he likes this new girl from a mutual friend..and how shes working at some church or something. Do u think he really likes her that much and doesnt miss me at all? I thought we had something different.....
20090204174954AAnyQK1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you make your girlfriend beg for more of you in her life?	My girlfriend is kinda independent and doesn't get bothered by things like i do for example, not texting a lot, not being able to hang out etc... At one point a few months back she said she wants me to play hard to get. How do i make her want to talk to me more, and want to chill? Ive read things on hard to get, but its kinda hard for me because im in love with her, but i want her to stay happy and interestedd in our relationshipp, and not get boored. I think im a bit clingy, and too easy, and i need some opinions so i can make her want me more.           -Thank you A LOT!!!
20090204174938AA9N4Vw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	DOES SHE LIKE ME OR NO? SHOULD I PURSUE OR NO?	well, it all started in august. We were chillin and what not. im 15 and she is 14. shes turning 15 this month of february. back to the point, well i met this girl from school and talked to her on aim. she was really diggin me and what not. we went out to the movies on saturday and then to the mall on sunday. We had lots of fun and that weekend was like heaven, we talked all night and everything was good but at the time i wasnt really interested in her. I didnt tell her or anything, but she was really interested in mean. So school started in september and it seemed as if things just changed immediately. she wasnt really im ing me as much as she used to, and she didnt really say much to me in the halls. Months later, i found out again that she liked this kid that i knew, but he already had a girlfriend, and he liked her, but she just couldnt really take it that he said he liked her but was in love with another girl. Recently i told him that i was talking to her and he said that she would try to look for another boyfriend but still like him, so i was like thanks for the heads up. That day, we were talking on aim about different stuff and i told her how my weekend was, and how i went to the mall with this other girl that was my good friend, and she was like nobody ever invites me anywhere, and i told her that i would invite her to the movies. I know this is really long but im not sure if i should pursue her or just leave her. my friend that she liked told me to pursue her. I really think i am in love with her and i told her how i felt. She hasnt really told me that she likes me though. There is a chance i might invite her o the movies this weekend thats coming, should i invite her? and i want a kiss really bad from her? should i go for lips or just cheek?
20090204175025AAaE0d5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How is swallowing semen any different from swallowing urine or feces?	I don't mean to be crude, but for a long time now I've been disturbed by the number of woman who willingly admit to swallowing their partner's ejaculate, and act as if this is a perfectly loving and normal act.  However these women usually also hold a more expected reaction (disgust) to the idea of swallowing urine.  Am I out of line in viewing both acts as equally degrading and repulsive?  How are the two different?

20090204175359AA9fApX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help me, my bf wants to "get with" other girls?	ok, to make a long story short, my boyfriend told me he wondered what having relations with someone else would be like, he said we both get to choose 1 guy/girl to sleep with just to see "if the grass is greener on the other side"   he said "this wont be consider cheating. i just want to do this out of curiosity"         i dont want to do this. and also, he chose his ex gf (she is bi) (her and her gf are doing the same thing)      i dont know what to do! i dont want him sleeping with her, because he is physicly atracted to her (but he keeps reasuring me thats all, he doesnt love her)   my bf, his ex gf and her gf, all say "it will make the relationship stronger" i dont think it will.   what should i do? i told him no, but the guilt is weighing on me. just the thought of him sleeping with his ex gf makes me physicly sick to my stomach.      please someone help!
20090204180942AAnnTsd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When I talked to this girl did I sound like an idiot?	Ok, so there is this really hot girl at my school. But she is a year younger so I only see her walking by in the halls and I have never talked to her. So today on Facebook (There is an I.M. function on there) I made it seem like it was an accident that I said hey to her and I meant to talk to someone else (It sounded like a better idea at the time, lol) So she said ok. If some guy did that to you would you know that the guy did it on purpose? And would she think I'm a weirdo if I try to talk to her again (not on accident this time). And what do you talk about if you have never talked to her, have none of the same friends, and not in the same classes?

20090204175748AADEqIj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get him to notice/talk to me?	i really dont want to sound like one of those desprate girls who ask strangers for help online, but i need some advice...   so there is this guy at my school. he is the foreign exchange student of one of my friends. i kind of like him but we havent really talked, he doesnt talk much. he is at a lot of my lunches and he sits with us (because of my friend) and i always catch him starring at me. then he casually looks away. he always smiles at me but never really talks to me. and i have no idea how to start a conversation with him. i think part of the reason he doesnt talk to me is because he doesnt know what to talk about. but he always looks like he wants to say something. and since he is a foreign exchange student most of my friends like him and are throwing themselves all over him. not to sound jealous or anything but that makes me really upset. i have no idea what to do. and i shouldnt even care since he is going back to europe in 6 months but i cant stop feeling like this and i tried. sorry for making this so long. any advice is appreciated.
20090204175904AAkKnUC	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I show him I want to be friends if I'm shy?	There's a guy I used to like, and my friend told him, but now he's got the wrong idea about me! She told him way back last year on the last day of the 6th grade. Now, I'm in the middle of 7th, but he acts like I don't exist!      For a while, he was friends with me, but now he never looks my way! Is HE shy? This guy is someone slightly arrogant, and confident. I can't think of HIM being shy, so does he just hate me?      I just want to be friends now! He's already broken my heart enough to show me I'm not ready to be in a relationship with anyone, let alone him!      I'm fairly shy, too, but only with STARTING conversations and such...

All last year we would get into stupid fights, then the next day be best friends again.

I cant stand to be around her anymore!  But I feel bad because her home life is not very good. her mom and dad are always at the bar, she gets hit, her mom acts like she rather be at the bar than with her, her brother is in and out of juvie and other things like that.

20090204183432AAD7pme	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE answer this. I really need to know. :/?	Okay, I sometimes see this guy in the hallways at school.   He's a sophomore, I'm a freshman.   When I see him in the hallway, he always looks really surprised when we first see each other. Like he's thinking "Whoa." But after that makes eye contact and kind of stares, not in a creepy way.   But it's like really obvious staring. I don't think he realizes how obvious it is. Once, he was walking out of a classroom as I was walking in. I saw him first, and was just looking around. He noticed me standing at the door and had that surprised look on his face, but then made eye contact until he passed me. And kind of looked me up and down.   I find him very attractive, and I think he might feel the same way, but I'm not sure. He's started smiling a bit when he sees me..like today.   I don't know what I should do. What do you think is going on with him?

20090204190715AAHAALl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend...Sex...Basketball..…	My boyfriend and I have been dating for 10 months now and I love him dearly. Well I tell every one that I love them but its deeper than that I feel for others. Anyway, he is younger than me by 10 months (such a coincidence) and he has had sex before. I am 17 turning 18 and I am still a virgin. He wants to have sex but I don't feel like I am ready. Here is the catch 22, I want to but I was raped when I was younger so every time we reach the undressing stage I start having flashbacks and can't go on any more.       2) We have been dating so long I guess I am starting to feel like it is time for a change of scenery and test the waters. I want to be with him but with me going off to college and him still being a sophomore in high school, the long distance thing just wont work for me.      3) All I really want to do is play basketball but I don't know how to be all about ball and maintain a relationship and 4.00 GPA. Something has got to give.       What do I do??? My sanity is my happiness. Please help!

20090204191401AAXzyZn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to control nervousness around someone I like?	Yes, I asked this before but only got two answers....      In church, our pastor paired us up in our youth group [teenagers, around 14] as prayer buddies or something of that nature. He has us hold hands with each other as we pray but I got paired up with my friend who I'm starting to like and when we're holding hands, I start getting nervous and laughing. Then I'm trying not to be rude and suppressing my laughter but then my chest starts shaking and so do my hands so I seem like I'm having a seizure or something. >,< and it's really awkward there's nothing funny to laugh at but I can't help it.       What do I do about being nervous and how do I stop shaking? This doesn't happen only around him. It happens in school too out of nowhere.... How should I fix this?      I don't think I'm immature, and people tell me I'm very mature for my age.  I'm not laughing at someone or something, I just am.  How should I stop this?

20090204193617AAQ9WVC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't really know a way to solve this problem...?	My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 21 months. Every once in a while she brings up the fact that she is Christian and I am Atheist/Agnostic. She says that it has always bothered her and will always continue to bother her and she doesn't like the idea of spending her whole life with me if she can't spend the afterlife with me. I have explained to her many times that I believe in an afterlife and that we could be together for eternity, I have always believed this. It's just that I don't believe in a "God". I have very good morals and don't really do anything bad. I've never smoked or drank or done any drugs, never hurt anyone or anything. I just don't know what to tell her.. she says I shouldn't become religious and I tell her I don't expect her to stop being religious. I don't know why it bothers her so much. I believe that we would be able to be together in the afterlife but apparently that's just not enough for her. I love her more than my own life and happiness... I just don't want to lose her =(

20090204194819AAaTwYZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There's this girl and we like each other but there is a problem...?	Ok, so there's this girl and I have liked her a long time. 5 almost 6 years.  I wont say this started out the best way but that's another story.  Her older brother and I were best friends (read on) and she is VERY family oriented (I love that by the way).  I was treated as part of their family by her mother, father, brother, all of their other family members etc. They treated me like their own son.  I was really close with them.       She was a teenage girl when my feelings began and I started writing her notes when she was 16.  We eventually started talking on the phone all the time and then started meeting places just so we could see each other.  We never did anything "bad",  we held hands but that was the extent of it. (I respect her in every way and would NEVER cross a line)  She always told her mother everything and she let it go for awhile.  Her mom eventually told her dad.  He was extremely upset and we had a talk and I said I wouldn't do it again but he told me to completely forget about his daughter.      That's extremely hard to do when it seems like your heart was made to beat for them. It was less than a year later and her brother found out that we were meeting again.  He told his dad and his dad has decided to completely ignore me and have nothing to do with me.  Since they are very family oriented her brother also stopped hanging out alone with me (we only see each other through mutual friends).  She and I stopped talking for awhile, now we are talking again but they know we talk every once in awhile.  I also still see her at church and on church events.        I like her and she likes me but her father is totally against us ever being together even though it makes us both happy.  I really am a great guy.  I have a nice job, good head on my shoulders, and a perfect gentleman.  I understand I betrayed their trust, twice, and that is also his baby girl.  I really want to be with this girl but I don't know how to make the family be "ok" with it. Any ideas?  Sorry it was so long!

20090204200042AA6XCtb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do? Why does she do this?	Im a senior in high school and ive been talking to this girl for a few months. She is a sophomore and at first it was a little awkward in the begining as it always is with conversation and other stuff. Lately though the past few times we have hung out we have been really connecting i think. We have felt more comfortable around eachother and the conversations are funn and interesting. During school though, she sometimes acts like she never sees me or wants to talk to me. like she will walk down the hall and if i dont say anything she will just keep walking. When i do say hi and make conversation she seems like she is trying to get away. I will be standing there talking to her and she will just like slowly start to walk like she has somwhere to go. Why is this happening? Also, i have had numerous conversations with her about getting into a relationship. She has told me that she likes me but is scared because im leaving next year. There is still a lot of time left in school plus the summer and i want her to go out with me. How can i make her realize that she should go out with me? One more thing is that sometimes she will blatently not make conversation when we are txting. I keep having to start new conversations because she just answers with the classic "yea" or "cool." other times though it goes well. Please help me. she is absolutely gorgeous and i want her to go out with me.

She seemed kinda shady but idk, i'm kinda the same with ppl i don't know.  neways, i called her today and no answer but the name she gave me matched the name on the voicemail (good sign).  she called back a few hours later, but i figured it would b pointless to continue this without gettin some advice.  Basically, how can i figure out if i'm wasting my time cuz this is totally new for me?

20090204210429AAeLnxN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a healthy relationship?	I'm 20 years old and don't know if my relationship is a healthy one or not.  Okay, so I have been with my boyfriend for pretty close to 2 years now.  We started dating our senior year in high school and things were fine at first.  Mind you I've know him since grade school. Now, my best friend of 10 years is telling me things aren't right and I see her position, but am unsure.  So, we went to prom with my best friends in the whole world and they all got along.  Then I moved in with my best friends and things went sour.  A big fight erupted between them and him and now they tolerate one another for me.  I've moved in with him now and he literally pays for everything, while I attend school.  Anyway, his behavior is as follows:  he calls me none stop when I'm away, he always tells me to be good whens he leaves, hes very insecure with himself and a personal issue of his, he basically wont let me talk to my ex's, nor my best friends, he tells me he'll kill himself if I break up with him, he always tells me to never leave him, he wont let me watch certain movies, if there's a guy or girl for that matter on TV naked or showing a body part he covers my eyes and looks away himself, he always screams at me about things I have done in our past every time we argue, and he constantly asks if we can have sex and when I say no he gets upset or asks again two seconds later, my friend also thinks he likes her, the list goes on and on.  I really don't know what to do.  I honestly love him, but his attitude is to the point of driving me crazy?  What the hell am I supposed to do?

20090204212337AAKg6W2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my mom think kissing is such a big deal?	She was pretty much yelling at me (ok, she was yelling) because she thinks I'm WAY too young to kiss. I'm 14. The thing I don't understand is why she's yelling; I've never even kissed anyone! It's not like I've done anything bad before, or slutty, or anything. It made absolutely NO sense. I still think she's wrong about an innocent kiss. Besides, I want my first kiss to be with someone I've liked for a long time. It's not like I'm gonna kiss very single guy I come across. So what do you guys think? Do you think I'm too young? (Once again, I'm 14)

20060616115244AATuJ8N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do Guys Think This Way...Or That Way?	My friend found her boyfriend's journal, which he goes into detail his lust for this girl. I told her that this is what men do, they always lust - survival of the species (the instinctual urge to reproduce for the sake of the continuation of mankind), her boyfriend just happened to write the lust down on paper.    Question: She feels that he is just keeping her around until this other girl comes around, acquiesce his lust. I told her that if he thought that if there was any chance at all, he would have dumped her in a heartbeat. Guys know, in varying degrees, the unspoken law girls have of not messing with another's man. If her boyfriend thought he had even the slightest chance and he actually wanted a relationship with this other girl, he would remove any and all obstacles that stood in his way....Like her, my friend. Who is correct, or is there another theory?

20060621144452AAfXEdE	Family & Relationships;Family	Does Anyone Else Have A Mean Mother?	My mother treats me and my children like crap. Meaning put down, never a kind word alway has to belittle us.  As for my sister and brother it's totally different, they are treated like a king and queen and their children.  My mother is two faced, talk with you then talk about you.   Mother is suppose to be a Christian, well she goes to church.  Guess the devil can go to church also.  How can you respect a person when they treat you so mean? In the Bible it says that we are to honor our father and mother. How can you honor someone that is mean to you.  These put downs have been going on for over 50 years.  I love my mother, and don't know what it's like to have a mothers love.  I believe in my heart that my mother hates me. Why, because she has made statements to me that made me wish I had never been born.    Today she hurt me again. Today I've decided to never have anything to do with her again.

20060710215849AAqoavk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know if she really likes me or if it's a set up.?	We've been talking for three days.  First day it wasn't really anything, second day and today it was all pretty much sex talk, likey cybering or cyber sex.  I want to go on a date with her, and she says she will because we both go to the same school but she just moved here over the summer so we haven't seen each other yet except for pictures.  She says she'll go on the date, to a movie theatre but she was like we'll have to make out and asked me if I'll touch her.  My questioin is, is she just really horny and want some, or do you think this is some kind of set up or she has a hidden agenda. (If the agenda is sex it's ok though.)
20060710221008AAGEP6C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you forgive your man and stay with him if this happened to you?	We went out for a week and I broke up with him because I wasn't sure.  Then, 3 months later we try going out again.  I stay at home and he goes out to party with his friends.  He drinks and smokes marijuana and he ends up having sex with someone.  He gave up drinking and smoking for me 2 years ago this August.  He comes home and is crying and feels so upset for what he has done because he finally realizes what happened.  He goes online and tells me right away when he gets home and tells me he's sorry.  We are so in love but at the time we didn't know each other that well and we never met each other by then except once but we didn't talk or anything.  We broke up and he was with her for a week or so.  We waited to get back together.  After that, we have been together for 2 years and 5 months this friday and we have known each other for 3 years this August.  I try not to hold it against him and I want to forgive him but it's really hard for me.  We plan on a future together!

20060724225007AAkUBpX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help me!?	So my best friend and my cousin are going out.  Talk about stuck in the middle.  It only got worse when my best friend told me she was breaking up with my cousin.  I told her to do what she wanted and so on.  What really got me angry was when my cousin told me he was breaking up with her.  I yelled at him for now putting me in the middle and then my sister is all helpful(not) and says "Well she was going to break up with you so it all works out"  Ugh...No she didn't.  So then my cousin gets pissed and gets the phone, I'm screaming at him not to call her, and he does anyway and breaks up with her.  I call her a few minutes later and she's bawling.  I act all sympthetic and she's telling me to go beat up my cousin and what not.   I hate getting stuck in the middle and now that they're back together I don't want it to happen again...What should I do?  (If I tell them to not tell me things my friend will take it offensivly and my cousin would blurt it out anyway)
20060713213425AA5xykj	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you regain lost honor?	I know this is usually for silly questions or some curiosity, but if you could take this serioully and may be help I would really appreciate it.  I wanted to be a USMC, but because of unforseeable circumstances I couldnt join.  I now realize that our word is the only thing that we have and that goes hand in hand with honor.  I am sorry to say that up to that point in my life I lead a less than honoable life.  I do the right thing now and own up to what I have done and the mistakes that I still make, but what good will that do since I have already since long ago lost my word and honor.  I thought that by joining the USMC it would help me regain what I've lost.  Dont get me wrong that was not the only reason I wanted to join that would of been wrong, but it was a strong reason from my point of view.  I couldnt think of another way to regain my honor and I still dont.  If any marines read this what would you do?Can you help?  Thank you

20060727202733AAF7gEq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think the problem with my sex life is?	My husband and i have been together since '99 and had been friends for years before we got together. We had 3 kids in the first 2 years of our marriage. So oveously the sex was great then. **what happed??** it was like some one just turned the switch off after i got pregnate the third time. We have talked about it and he says that sex is just not that important to him. I think that its the fact that when we first got together i was 36-22-36 and now Im 46-36-46 i'm 5ft tall and 170lbs. He swears up and down its not my weight and that he still finds me sexy. but wouldnt he want sex with me more if he did?? Or is it me? Am i just over reacting and once a week to once every two weeks the best i'm to expect?? (some times its longer apart) what do you think?

Winked at me a couple of times after a conversation.  Started making more eye contact.  But when I tried to be nice and have a conversation that wasn't work related.  He acted so funny, shy scratching under his chin and tried to play a trick on someone.  To get away from the conversing.  He did smile and me and really look me in the eyes.  But ever since he's been so hot and cold. The next day he past me and looked at me standoffish like.  But then an hour later was trying to get my attention.  Looking at me and smiling.  But then ignoring me again. Then ran into me in the hall and I handed him something for his area and he just stared me straight in the eyes for like 5 sec with a really serious look then looked down to grab the paper and giggled.  Of course ignored me again.  So I started ignoring him.  As soon as I did this he again tried to get my attention.  But he had a serious look not laughing.

One minute he's flirting the next ignoring me.  If he sees me talking to another guy will I be able to tell if he really likes me or not?

I am in my late 20's and my fiancee and I have been together for 7 years.  We have a freind that is really cool and such.  Anyways we have a very healthy relationship and my bf wants to please me by having them both in bed with me.  We are both straight, no kids, etc.  Both successful in careers.  If we do this I am scared of something bad happening to me and my bf although we are strong.  Any advice and opinions.  Please no answers to mock fun...This is a serious question and I want WOMEN opinions.  So please answer if you have and how it went.
20060728075235AAGGGGf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What am I to say and do?	There is a man that I have been friends for for 14 years and we lost contact maybe 8 years ago. We never dated but we were good friends and often flirted with each other. After high school we would hang out and eventually we would kiss, make out, and grind but never anything further. Now 3 months ago we ran into each other and we have been hanging out like the good ole days. We like each other, but we never talk about it. I have not been with a man in almost 4 years and everytime we are together I cannot bring myself to talk to him about it us. 2 weeks ago I spent the nite at his house and we ended up just kissing on each other. I didn't give it up. so yesterday I went to visit him and he had a fading hickey on his neck and I felt awkward and hurt. Later that nite I went to visit him at work and he was looking at me with these eyes that make me melt. We did not talk about it. Today is his birthday and he wants me to come over all day. But now what shall I do, now that he had the hickey

20060729152443AA6FLgl	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm In Love With My Friend!!!?	Me and this guy have been GOOD friends since the day that we met.  It was never really just a friendly thing.  We've had what I now consider a fake relationship for the past 8 months.  He's been telling me that he's still trying to get over some past relationship issues and that we're going to be together one day.  Unfortunately, it's taking too long, and I feel used, so I told him that the way I felt about him, I could no longer be his friend.  I'm emotionally and physically attracted to him and now that I've gotten him out of my life, I wish I could take it back.  Does he have intentions of being with me in the future, or did I help myself out by getting out of the situation.

20060801223635AAE1xu3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell a woman that you have erection problem?	Please women, tell me what to do. I am a healthy 37 y male. I have always been very horny, but I had an episode of depression and took Prozac for some time. I think that had something to do with the fact that a few short months after that I was loosing erection and interest.   Now after 2 years hiding from people I have began to take care of my depression problem. I began feeling interest in sex again. I had sex  good 3 times this year with one partner and 1 with another. I know that is nothing for most of you, but I've never gotten much sex in my life, so for me that is GREAT.   The problem is that now with the last woman the situation was not clear and emotionally charged. I was having problems again.   I think that if I found some woman out there that will be interested in being intimate with me I might be able to get back to normal.    The problem is how to tell someone about this little problem and that I probably need to take Viagra in order to perform? Is that a major turn-off?

I've had to wear glasses my whole life starting at age 3 and it soooo sucked now i'm 27 i have a job and no kids and i figured "hey i can afford it, why not" the doctor gave me a list of references but i would rather ask someone that dosnt come from the doctor. What can i expect during and after the surgery. My insurance will pay 15% of it so it comes out to about 1200 each eye.

20060824161048AAHp1PD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can I terminate my parental rights even if the mother is not getting married?	The mother has been in a relationship with another man for three years and has two children with him.  My Daughter has always lived with her.  I went to court to get visitation rights several times and ACS has even inspected my home.  Yet I was given no rights I have to travel 45miles to spend only a few hrs with her and bring her back home.  Although they will not allow liberal visitation or other wise they have no problem taking half my paycheck.  To be very clear there is nothing wrong with me I am married and have other child with my wife.  I am a government employee and a good citizen just trying to be a part of my daughters life.  Yet it seems as all the courts will allow me to do is pay too much in child support so much that my wife and children go without because of the gross loss of income.  It wouldn't bother us so much if my daughter was a part of our life but the mothers boyfriend seems to be given more respect and taking my role. So can I give up my rights?

20060825044435AAd2ebU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do I give a wedding gift or not in this case?	Here's the story.  I was invited several weeks ago to go to a wedding as the date of the bride's sister.  I really don't know the bride at all (other than maybe we'd recognize each other), and I certainly don't know the groom.        As a guy acting as the date of the bride's sister, should I plan on bringing a wedding gift?  If so, should it just be something like cash - basically does the same old rule of "make sure you're at least taking care of your cost" apply here?      Just curious, and I'd like to err on the side of "well that was overly generous!" than being somehow labeled a cheap SOB.      Thanks for any help.

Today, just a while ago, she started to beat me up just because i didn't put on a design your own doll website named dollwizard.com.

So then i hold her hands and she screams, she gets free again and starts beating. Then my dad comes and she starts to act all innocent. My dad says what i am doing to her is child abuse, but does not realize that what she is doing to me is child abuse. So i cant punish her, wen i try, she crys to my dad acting all innocent. So my dad thinks she's the weak, innocent 1, an its the opposite. What do i do?! an don say talk to them, cuz it don work!

20060830164502AAqixnF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think I have a commitment problem??	I'm am 26 and had about 4 relationships that were long term, ranging from a year to three. 16-19, 19-20,20-22, and 22-25, and am now in a relationship since about mid june. There was about a 3-6  month gap in between each relation ship with some dating, but mostly just relationships. I have ended all of them but one, and that one I caused enough problems that forced a break up. Why do I do this? Well when it comes to the point that they talk about marriage, I want out. I have really loved some of them but I really believe that at some point you have to say yes I could marry this person some day, or no I wouldn't. After all a good marriage is about more then love. So if I know thats what they see in the future I figgure they should get started looking  for some one eles. Every one tells me that I am being to picky and that I should settle down, but I only want to get married once.

20060902192840AAJmNLP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Going back on my word....?	Hey all.  I met a really good guy almost two months ago.  After I got to know him a bit more I started to get interested in having more than a friendship with him.  After a little bit of casual flirting, I think we both developed a crush on each other.   He doesn't smoke, I do.  He's totally against it and he's been insistant on me quitting.  I think he wants me to quit so we can start seeing each other b/c he doesn't date smokers.  He convinced me to quit, so I set a date.  We're supposed to attend a local fair soon, the first day I quit.   However, I don't want to quit smoking.  Right now is not the best time for that, I'm starting school soon and have to maintain a job so I can pay rent, other bills and to buy groceries.  It's going to be a stressful time as it is, I really don't feel like adding onto it by quiting smoking just yet.     What's the easiest way to tell him this without hurting him or pissing him off?

By the way she has done good turns for me and I will always be eternally grateful. But everything has to be done on her terms.

20060926042543AAxKyY0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship advice please?	I'm going out with a boy called Paddy. My best friend, Meika, likes him. She and I started liking him at the same time, and didn't tell eachother. She asked me if I liked him (cuz I was flirting with him apparently) and I denied it, she said that she DID like him. The next day, he told me he liked me and I realised that I did like him afterall, and we started going out. Meika decided she didn't want to know mend stopped talking to me. I then tried to dump Paddy but he got the wrong idea and thought I meant going out in secret; I didn't have the heart to tell him. Gradually people started finding out, and, by the time I had decided to dump Paddy properly, someone had told Meika. Now, most of my friends hate me (not an understatement), and I can't do anything about it that I can see ...   I can't apologise because I did that last time, and I can't dump Paddy because (a) Every one would think I was lying, & (b) They wouldn't care anymore.   What can I do?   It's such a mess.

20060926083625AA9RqLV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Men: Why do they remarry so fast?	My theory- I believe there is an undiscovered chemical reaction that occurs when men have sex with women. I think the vaginal walls are lined with a fluid that erases the memory of wives, children and grandchildren.   I am constantly stunned and amazed at how men can be married for 30, 40 or 50 years and lose thier wives and then remarry just months after burying her. Almost all of them have nothing to do with their children and grandchildren after their wives die and new women move into their lives. These new wives take over all communications with their "new" husbands "ex" families and they systematically break down the bonds with children and grandchildren until the man has little to no contact at all the people with whom he spent most of his life.      There must be some kind of chemical reaction between the penis and the vagina that erases the significance of anyone the man knew before.       I personally know 23 men who remarried less than a year after losing their wives.

Hace tres semanas atras me propuso matrimonio y lo escribio en un CD que me regalo. Le dije que tenia que pensarlo; por su caracter y por que un matrimonio no es chiste, es algo mas serio.Una semana despues; le descubri en la computadora que habia colocado su informacion en una pajina internet. Diciendo que es soltero. Que esta buscando una persona, que quiere tener mas hijos y hasta cuando gana en el trabajo. Cosa que ni yo sabia por que el dinero es lo menos que me interesa. Cuando lo confronte,dijo que lo habia hecho por que yo no le conteste lo del casamiento y que no se arrepentia,que le daba gusto que yo lo hubiera visto. Lo unico que desde ese dia yo ni duermo bien. Y le perdi la confiansa. Creo que cada vez que veo su cara veo la vendita pagina esa del internet.

But neither of us have gone all the way, i have my own reasons and she wants to wait till she gets married and i respect that, and i dont presure her about it at all, but sometimes she makes it really hard to resist, having said all that knowing that she wants to wait do girls  ever change there mind in that sense or how long does it usually take till they might give it up or change there mind or what should i do to speed it up???

Any information about this case or where I can find information about this type of case.

20061009100704AAxXGlN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sorry--- re-posting...... I could use some honest answers here....Thx!!!?	Why am I so doubtful??   I am dating a guy who is great. He's very honest, and I trust that he would never cheat. I know that he has strong character, and that he strives to do the right thing, so my doubts don't stem from him.    I get freaked out though. He is away at school, and I can only see him every other weekend or so. I have a busy life too, so even though the distance sucks, It's probably better . But I can't seem to get over my insecurity. I am an otherwise strong and stable person, but I get anxiety about him- does he feel as strongly as I do? Are his feelings changing? Is the distance thing going to be too hard for him? What if this isn't going to work out? What if I'm wasting my time? What if...what if...    I can't stand that I'm being so fearful- it seems irrational. I think that he might be able to pick up on the fact that I feel insecure, and we all know how unnatractive THAT is!! can anyone relate to this??    Any suggestions on how to change my attitude?

20061115061114AAagTmr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hey! What should I do about this situation?	Ok. Last night i broke up with my boyfriend of in reality one year. We was on and off, but on mostly. So after my game last night I broke up with him due to age difference(he's older), due to because i like someone in my grade, and I just wanted to do what I do. His family is so huge and is very dissapointed because we were an awesome couple. So...I mean I dumped him also to go with this dude in my grade because I have been liking older dudes and it is time for me to setlle within my grade. Anyone who knows or understands my situation would say you're right or its about time. So he called me on the way home from the game. He rushed home to call me because we stopped off at McDonald's. He said he still loves me, yet still mad and e is sprung. What does this sound like and what should I do? Please leave a comment but, don't leave anything stupid.

20061015084550AASE2k7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I can't stand my husband's family? Help because I feel like I want to separate because of it/?	My husband's extended family loves to gossip and gang up on people. At the present momment I am their target. I used to be very close with my husband's cousin, and I used to use her as my confidant. I have said a few things that I shouldn't in fits of anger. But, his cousin has said worse things about people and I kept her confidences but she hasn't kept mine. So when all this blew up I have distanced myself from my husband's family trying to stay away from everything and letting things blow over. Well, its been over a year and I haven't seen anyone or spoke to anyone since a wedding on the weekend, and I was continuously attacked b/c my husband doesn't want to associate with his family much anymore because all they do is use each other, talk about each other, and treat each other poorly because they all are too busy competing with each other. well now they blame me for his distancing from the family, But, its been all his choice and I have never encourgaed him to do that.

20061015220037AAD50yh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Broken Friendship Question (Brace Yourself...)?	I'm a girl & my best friend of 2 years is a guy. We hang out w/ the same group & we are involved in everything together. A lot of his guy friends tease him about having a girl for a bff. Not b/c they really care, but b/c it makes him mad. When he starts to get upset like this, he takes it out on my by yelling. He made me cry b/c I didn't want to join debate & he once ran to the bathroom when he saw the guys enter the restaurant we were at, in order to avoid them. Of course, I told him how lame & pathetic he was for this & he always says sorry. But 3 weeks ago he did similar things & I said "that's it". & I haven't talked to him since. He tries to say stuff to me. I ignore him. But, he has yet to even attempt to say "sorry". I know he sounds like a total jerk, & he is - a large part of the time, but when he is not being like that, he makes me laugh & smile, & it is like we complete each other. We even finish each other's sentences, just like any other best friends. I really miss him. I know that seems quite silly since he constantly hurts me emotionally. But, the feeling can't be helped. 1. Should I get over him 2.respond when he talks to me and simply be better again or 3.wait for an apology?

20061019100016AAJmWVr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My b/f and i have been together for 3 yrs but he is totally freaked out about commitment. What should i do?!?	We have been together since high school. He is now beginning his 3rd year of college and I have been working full time since I finished high school without going to college. He lives in the dorms at the university that he attends so he is always around people his age who are not interested in commitment either and just want to live up the college life. On the other hand, I am always around older people and have kind of matured faster than him. The thing is I would like some kind of formal commitment since we have been together for quite some time. When is the right time to bring the subject up without sounding pushy and what should I say? I dont want it to sound like I want him to marry me tomorrow but something that says that we are more than just boyfriend and girlfriend... Does that make sense?

20061024131136AAw0ThK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong with Mr. Right?	You're at a social event of any sort you wish; a bar, a church gathering, a fair, etc.  Someone walks up to you and tells you his/her friend is interested in you and would like to meet.  This person was not necessarily sent by this friend, so let's not assume the one interested in you is shy.  Now, the person who approached you is trying to make this friend appealing to you and tells you of a characteristic this person has, thinking it will make him/her appealing.  It doesn't; in fact, it repels you a little.  What did he/she say?  In a nutshell, what is a commonly desired characteristic that actually repels you?  Maybe you don't like kids, so a person who wants children would not interest you. Is there a commonly undesired characteristic you find attractive? Perhaps you're insecure and feel more comfortable around others who are insecure.  These are just examples; it can be anything.  There must be someone out there who thinks the stereotyipical Mr. Right is repulsive in some way.

UUGGHH I REALLY LIKE HIM! IDK WHAT TO DO! everyone tells me hes a jerk but i really dont think he is cuz hes nice to everyone. except me. which makes no sense cuz he likes me. or does he?

Era evidente que el no iba a cortar porque en gral los hombres son así, siempre quieren tener un huesito para entretenerse, y para mi no era una reilación que me diera lo mismo, a mi el chico me importaba, así que como la relación me estaba haciendo mal y no íbamos ni para adelante ni para atrás, decidí cortar, y él en principio no quería, pero después aceptó.

My boyfriend's mother just recently found out we've been dating & she hates my guts! I have never met her & she has never met me. She works at the highschool I used to attend & she's heard rumors about me. These rumors include:1) I slept with 7 guys in one weekend, 2) I have chlamydia, 3) I dated a 40 year old man whom we both know; all of which are NOT TRUE. She is completely unreasonable & swears these rumors are all true. My boyfriend is completely torn because he doesn't want to break up but his mother is making his life a living hell! She tries to guilt him by telling him she's going to die because of him. She told him he's going to get sores on his ---- & that everyone thinks less of him now because he's with me & they think he has a disease.  Would it be completely degrading to give her my medical records to prove her wrong atleast on 1 count, so she thinks about the rest? We are all adults, what can I do to make her more reasonable, atleast to listen to what we have to say?

20061114180712AAmgeRH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Goodbye to ex?	My ex dumped me through an email a month ago just after she started seeing a therapist due to her unhappy life, father passing away, and low self esteem.  At the time I understood her reasoning saying she needed to sort her life out.  She asked me not to hate her and that because of her the timing of us sucked, even though she thought we had really good potential.  She said she still wanted to be friends and talk cuz thats all she coudl handel. So after a while I agreed cause I cared for her and wanted to be there for her as a friend through this tough time.  She sends me an email last week saying she hopes everything with me is giong well and to drop her a line whenever.  Then I get in an accident 15 minutes from her house last night.  I was in shock when the accident, my first, happened.  I knew she was close, I needed a ride and voice, but when I txt her, thats how she likes to communicate, she never replied or called me today to ask me how I was... What should I think of this??

20061115212545AA61w6A	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should i have done that?	I kind of just dumped my boyfriend, and it was rather easy for me. I'm not sure if its just the adrenaline rush i had or what; i don't know how i did. But I need to know if I was wrong in any way. My boyfriend, he is super moody. Sometimes (frequently) he gets in these moods where he absolutely does not care at all. Now he can't make long distance calls on his phone, only i can, so he gets on yahoo messenger to tell me when to call. Well, here i am at home having many emotional problems, because i'm really afraid i might be pregnant, and all i wanted was to tell him how scared i was and for him to try and comfort me. Well, when he got online we were talking and i told him i felt miserable but i didn't want to talk about it online. eventually stuff happened. and he just played around with my emotions i don't think he realized it. But it happened one to many times so i just broke off a 1 year and 5 month relationship.

20070110150904AA6dgIK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I wait for love?	I am currently single and hating it, lol.  Anyways I am planning on moving to Germany in July of this year to become an English teacher abroad.  I haven't dated since the breakup with my ex almost 2 years ago.  I have been single ever since.  I am wondering if I should wait to look for a girlfriend until I get to Germany?  If I get one here I'll end up having to leave.  So instead of overreacting and getting depressed about being single should I wait until I get to Germany instead of trying to look for love here?

20070217201819AAiWmBL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	?Y ustedes que opinan de esto?	El día de ayer en una platica con un amigo aparecio el tema de la infidelidad. El opina que la infidelidad en un matrimonio, es mala en los padres de familia, pero es aún más mala en las madres él comenta que no puede ser que la madre se atreva a hacer eso, que seria "sucia". Yo no estoy deacuerdo con él, para mi la infidelidad tanto en el padre como en la madre es mala, es igual y tiene la misma consecuencia, si estas en una relación es porque te comprometes con esa persona y la debes de respetar. En mi opinion lo que piensa mi amigo es muy machista , ?Ustedes que opinan?

I'm the kind of guy who likes to bring joy to people who are sad, Some people might say I'm a hero. I use the ultimate symbol of happiness, Jar Jar Binks. I wear an elaborate Jar Jar costume/mask while trying to help. I wanted to help some really depressed people, so I put on my costume and hung around the cemetary. A funeral started, it was for a man that died. His wife and family were there. I tried to cheer them up by doing Jar Jar dances, and yelling Jar Jar quotes at the top of my lungs. I stood next to the priest who was talking and screamed. I danced around, pulled up clumps of dirt and threw them, and made loud noises with my air horn. Some guy told me to get out of there but I didn't listen. I pulled out my toy light saber and started poking the corpse with it while singing Jar Jar songs. People started yelling at me and others were crying. Some people began to chase me but I ran around, screaming. Eventually, the dead guys brother punched me. Do you think I should sue him?

20070211010631AAXCyTn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think of these Valentines day words?	Never break heart of the person that loves you, Even if you don’t love that person.   But make that person change their perception about you in a different way.      Man can live with food water and air. But its impossible to exist without Love.      A woman can change a man from a monster to a human being. And vice versa.      Never try to impress a girl through riches. Because however man maybe rich but he’s poor compared to a woman’s beauty and instinct she’s always rich.      Don’t be too emotional as it may lead to break up cause woman’s look opposite of what they are.      The most dangerous weapon of a woman is her tears which can melt even the strongest of metal. So dont make her cry as you may not want to destroy yourself.      Never Judge a woman by her ways but know her maybe she’s not what you think she is.      The most beautiful sight for a man is to see the Girl he loves with his children in here arms.      Blessed are those who get the oones they love, And the love is both ways.

20070217144153AAUK9Vb	Family & Relationships;Family	Emotion Issues?	OK, for about 3 years, I've been in the stage where you're hit with all these hormone changes, mood swings, etc. Sometimes I wonder if my family even remembers that it's normal for that to happen. I've always been real sensitive, but now more than ever. My family just sees it as "You've got a bad attitude" or "Why do you always have to argue, or have the last word, or disagree..." I don't purposely act this way, and they're being kind of insensitive about it. I'm always getting lectured about it, but when I try to express my feelings, they don't believe me, they think I'm just making excuses. What should I do?

20070217185651AAnlErq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	49 y old falling for 25 y old guy. Lust or love?	I am a 49 years old married for 25 years but my hubby has a mistress. I am a boss in my lab. 2 years ago a 25 year old   guy reported as a new scientist to my lab. He is very shy but intelligent. I found out that there is strong chemistry between us. I am not sure about him but from his reaction of staring at me quiet often and blushing everytime he met me I am sure the feeling is mutual. He would find an excuse to be near me everytime we discuss about something and sometimes our hands touched each other Our eyes always locked together whenever we talk and I always have this unbearable pain in my chest and life suddenly become meaningless when he was not around. I have send a message to him saying that I miss him and he is always in my mind but he never replied. I felt very ashamed of myself and avoid him for a few weeks and things become as usual after that. Now I am not sure whether it is lust or love on his side and should I confront him?
