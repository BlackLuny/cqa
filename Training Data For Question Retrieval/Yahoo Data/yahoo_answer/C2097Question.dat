I receive emails with text and images but instead of getting the image I get a little box with a red X in it.

20090203150951AAn2nss	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	I am SO fed up with most of the people on Yahoo Answers!!!!!!!?	WHY can't you just give a civil answer?   Every single question I ask and every single question I read, some idiotic person has to give a stupid reply...      Like I asked a question about sew in extensions an hour ago...   I get 3 replies.   One was "fake"   2nd was "If youre not a fire crotch, dont dye your hair red the boys will see right through it"...and I happen to think that my hair looks good when it was dyed red and regardless it's not your freakin business if it looks good or not when I was asking about extensions and I'm not asking for your opinion!      I know it's not just me because others after their question they write "please no sarcastic or rude comments"      And I know even for just writing this I will get those sarcastic and rude comments...   I'm just asking, PLEASE, have some sympathy because you're seriously hurting peoples feelings! Be mature?

20090203153814AAGDf7Y	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why doesn't Yahoo fix the way contacts are handled?	I think the whole "add as contact" feature is completely flawed. And before I begin, don't tell me to disable people adding me as fans; I want fans, just not certain ones. Also, don't tell me to block them.      There's always a few annoying dolts that add me as a contact, then answer every one of my questions with stupidity. I don't want to block them, because it's a little extreme for what my purpose of removing them from my fan list is.      My suggestion is, why not make the "contact" feature require mutuality between both parties BEFORE allowing either one to see the other's Q&A?

Ok, so before, like yesterday, if I answered a question, it would go at the bottom, and it would keep building up. So it'd be like:   1st person who answered,   2nd person who answered,   3rd person who answered   Now, today, it is going like this:   3rd person who answered,   2nd person who answered,   1st person who answered.   I don't get it. What did Y!A do? It's confusing.
