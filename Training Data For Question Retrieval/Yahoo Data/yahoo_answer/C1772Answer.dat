fFnsJ7maaa	I haven't seen any of the briefings, but I looked at the transcripts a few times. They don't give names but the Press Secretary does sometimes call the questioner by first name.<br>  <br>  Associated Press’ Jennifer Loven was the first at the televised press conference on Feb 9th, and has been first in some of the transcripts. Not sure if she's always first. <br>  <br>  Helen Thomas, aged 88, was traditionally given the first question at press conferences. She's a columnist for Hearst Corporation. And a bit... loopy. No one could mistake her for a girl, though.

Nobody is being forced to commit murder.  However, doctors will be forced to refer patients who seek abortions, contraceptives, or other services to professionals who do provide those services, regardless of whether the doctor themselves agree with them.  That is proper because doctors have an obligation to serve their patients regardless of their personal opinions.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Please calm down.  President Obama is not going to institue any regulation that would force Dr.s and nurses to participate in abortions if they believe it is morally wrong.  <br>  <br>  I have worked in the medical field many years, and there are many Christian doctors that don't believe abortion is murder nor against their religion.<br>  <br>  "News organizations are reporting that the Obama administration is moving to repeal Bush’s dangerous, last-minute regulation that could allow anyone from a woman’s doctor to her doctor’s receptionist to her entire HMO system to deny women reproductive-health services. Bush’s last-minute regulation was a parting gift to his anti-choice base. It could allow insurance companies to deny claims for the pill, hospitals to refuse emergency contraceptives to rape survivors, and employees at HMOs to refuse their patients referrals for abortion care."<br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  President Obama does not want to take anyone's right to religious freedom.

bGuVAltxaa	Of course you don't expect them to say they have committed crimes, the Israeli's have one of the most modern armies in the world equipped with the most up to date U.S military hardware, and they use everything against mostly civilians and poorly equipped fighters, numerous human rights organisations have said the Israeli's have broken the Geneva convention with both weapons they use and individual crimes against humanity, they have ignored over 500 U.N resolutions and got away with it because of the U.S, they deny civilians everyday necessities like food, water, electricity and medical supplies and they bulldoze their homes. If that is not committing a crime, I don't know what is.|`|fFq68dJYaa	Of course they did. Name me a country, any country of your choice, and I will easily demonstrate that they also commited crimes through recent 60 years of their history.<br>  <br>  The thing is, committing crimes on case-by-case basis is one thing. Creating a structure devoted to one thing only - committing crimes - is completely different.<br>  <br>  As for history - Israel did not start fighting with Hamas to begin with, Israel started to fight with whoever was determined not to let Israel be created at that point of time. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a small sidenote - using DIME bombs is not a crime, actually.

Trying to get Israel apologists to admit they are bloodthirsty is nigh on impossible, so let's allow the facts to speak for themselves. Probably Israel's most devastating massacre yet was the invasion of Lebanon, where around 17500 people were killed, and in the words of Mordechai Bar-on, an education officer in the Israeli military, the aim of the invasion was "to deal a crushing blow to the national aspirations of the Palestinians and to their very existence as a nation endevouring to define itself and gain the right to self-determination". It is an indisputable fact that Israel is a fascist state, second only to the USA in its acts of mass murder.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Yes,  Israel has committed crimes.   <br>  <br>  And the Palestinians in the form of the PLO,  Hamas, Fatah,  Hezbollah and all the other fanatical Islamic terrorist groups allied with them have committed far more.   <br>  <br>  It is like comparing a kid stealing a cookie with a serial rapist and sodomizer of children.|`|L2QdPvSUaa	Can idiots like you understand that there are no such things as rules in war and if you're a general your job is to beat the crap out of your enemy as much as possible?|`|OJShm63saa	I don't understand how anyone could be pro-israel in the first place<br>  <br>  it's mind boggling|`|0RuNbOGlaa	Hamas is no more than a political faction of the palestinian government, much the same as being a democrat or Republican, and since the United States and Israel have managed to disarm them, their only method of retaliation for the land grab committed by the Israeli's is the sending of these lousy, inaccurate rockets intol Israel.<br>    Now, as far as any negotiations are concerned, Israel will not, and has not agreed to any form of negotiations that involve any give back of land, homes, release of the over 9000 prisoners, or the right for the Palestinians to return to their homes.<br>   I see you claim to be well aware of the history of these events, and if so you should realise the real problem, and it's not the Palestinians.<br>   All they ask for is what has been taken from them, and no, they did not start this war against Israel.<br>  <br>  Anne S":  Talk about crimes by sending a rocket into Israel and killing people. As I remember this last count was, one jew killed and about 1300 innocent Palestinians killed by the Israeli military, and you believe the jews have not committed any crime.<br>    Take the time to look up and research the amount of United Nations resolutions against Israel for just that reason.<br>  <br>  Andrew:  Israel does not have the right to bomb or destroy any electric producing facility anywhere, atomic powered or not.  Iran is a sovereign nation and they have every right as stated in the NPT to pursue nuclear energy for peacful purposes as does any other signatory nation, and since Israel refuses to sign such treaties, they have no right to enforce others or curtail, their actions.<br>    I cannot understand why the Jewish sympathizers keep saying that "Israel has a right to exist" when they refuse to reconize that right to others.<br>  <br>  To all : let hear the excuse for the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty in 1967, if not an attempt to sink and kill innocent people.

Last I checked, the West Bank and Gaza strip were part of Egypt and Jordan until 1967 when Israel won the 6 Day War, capturing those areas in the process. 2008 minus 1967 doesn't equal 60.<br>  <br>  * Ethnic cleansing? Are you mad? What ethnic cleansing are you talking about? With Gaza's birth rate, after the 3 weeks of the operation, the population in Gaza has only grown. Additionally, if Israel did want to seize Gaza and/or commit ethnic cleansing, given Israel's military capabilities, there wouldn't be a thing called "Palestinians" by the end of the first day.<br>  <br>  * Lands weren't given to Jews, they were bought prior to 1947. What was given to Jews and Arabs is CONTROL of the area previously controlled by Britain, and previously controlled by the Ottoman empire for 300 years. With Britain leaving Israel/Palestine in 1947, someone had to be given control of the area. A united Jewish-Arab government wouldn't work, so the area was split into "Mainly Jewish" areas under Jewish control and "Mainly Arab" areas under Arab control. There were also many Jews in Arab areas, but they were already killed or driven out through ethnic cleansing before or after May 15th, 1947, when 7 Arab countries and the Arabs in Palestine tried to conquer Israel. You're saying Israel drove out the Arabs. You're wrong. They were told by Arab country leaders to leave the area so the arab countries can basically bomb the crap out of the Jews. Even Mahmoud Abbas, Israel's Palestinian authority leader, admitted it. And facts speak for themself - Over a million Arabs and Muslims who didn't leave Israel were given full citizenship rights and were allowed to keep all their property and keep living where they were.<br>  <br>  You do need a history lesson, one that isn't taught by extremists and fanatics.<br>  <br>  And just to answer your question RELATIVELY shortly - There's no country in the world which hasn't commited a crime of some sort. Israel is no exception. I'm not sure if you're refering to individual crimes or government-led crimes, but I'm sure what you have in your mind is far from the truth.<br>  <br>  There's cases of individual crimes, like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3476525,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0...</a><br>  <br>  And the worst crime the Israeli government has ever done which was indeed counted as Illegal is not stopping the massacre of the Christian Phalanges in Lebanon against the Arab population in Sabra and Shatila. And even in that case, the people responsible had to resign. This was the worst, if not the only, government crime which was actually considered a crime by a board of judges. That's Israel's worst crime - Not stopping a masscare commited by Christian Phalanges. I can think of worst crimes almost every country in the world has commited. As for what you'd like to believe regarding "Israel's war crimes in Gaza", fact is that the international court for war crimes isn't even considering filing a case, since nothing there was illegal. Even when Tzipi Livni visited Hague, the court didn't request to have her trialed and/or arrested despite fanatics who chewed on some propaganda protesting and demanding it.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  In regard to the links you gave:<br>  1st link - The soldiers shot after being assaulted with stones and the Israeli government said it would investigate. Israeli soldiers don't use live ammunition unless it's a life threatening situation and other measures have failed. If you think stones are harmless, say that to the families of dozens of Israelies who were killed or became handicapped thanks to those stone-throwers.<br>  <br>  2nd link - Israel took action against the soldier involved, like it usually does. But how would you know that? You read Al-Jazeera. Just read the link I gave above - A soldier stealing 50$ from a Palestinian is facing 10 years in jail. What do you think a soldier headbutting a Palestinian would face? <br>  <br>  3rd link - I don't trust Palestinian reports, considering how reliable they are. In 2002, during a Jenin operation when the Israeli army barred media from entering Jenin, the Palestinians claimed that Israel has killed over a thousand indiscriminately and even burried killed Palestinians in mass graves. The investigation conducted by Amnesty's human rights group, as well as 3 other human right groups, showed that only 54 people were killed, out of which, 45 were militants. Until I see a reliable investigation into it, I consider it inaccurate and incorrect.<br>  <br>  4th link - I can take most of those pictures and claim it's Israeli casualties. Palestinian propaganists are famous for misusing pictures. If you don't believe me, here's an example:<br>  <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/reports/The_Photo_that_Started_it_All.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/...</a><br>  Additionally, most of the top 4 pics seem to appear quite fake.|`|adznfYe3aa	In sixty years of course crimes have been committed but most have been in response to attacks from Arabs trying to remove Israel from the Middle East.<br>  You are well versed in your version of events.

AA12175935	What can I say about 9/11 except that it was a politically motivated crime where the true perpetrators are under suspicion of a minority of the citizens.<br>  <br>  The "questions" that these professionals and the victim's family members have is not enough to move the government to answer. They won't answer. What they need to do is take action! Sue the government for the answers! The video tapes at the pentagon, the explanation of NORAD's failure, the bombs heard in the buildings on many eyewitness accounts, the structural blueprints of the buildings (which is public information is being hidden by the government).<br>  <br>  The truth is there, but the government doesn't want us to access it.

However, I would have to seriously consider some of your statements, specially the one regarding the legalization of marijuana. The reason I would support the legalization of marijuana is that it would be a good way to end the mafia and organized crime behind drugs. I say this because I live in Guatemala, a country in Central America which is dominated by drug traffickers. The government in our country is nothing compared to the power of drug dealers (that transport and sell drugs to the U.S.) who cause the population to live in constant fear. I believe that one way to take some of the power of drug traffickers and organized crime would be to legalize the drugs that give them a lot of their income.<br>  <br>  I do agree with you in the fact that drugs "are destroying the very fabric of American culture and society," and it seems as a good reason not to support the legalization of marijuana or any other drug. But, if compared with the prohibition of alcohol of the twenties and early thirties, I guess we would agree that the government should legalize drugs. It is clear that the prohibition allowed gangsters and mafia to earn millions of dollars while causing terror and death to many people.<br>  <br>  Smoking marijuana is morally wrong if it turns into a vice, but the fact that it is morally wrong is not reason enough for the government to declare it illegal. When the government gets into this kind of matters, it allows criminals to develop illegal activities that only give them more power and income than they already have.|`|7tieiv6qaa	No, I don't think they're evil.<br>  I do think they're dumb.<br>  I've got a friend who's done it probably 30 years now and I've known him a little longer.

D4jZM26Paa	They think that firing rockets into Israel, will contribute to the destruction of Israel, who they feel don't deserve the right to the land.<br>  <br>  Even though the people living in Israel have survived the most sophisticated attempt at genocide in history, and these rockets only cause minimal damage.|`|AS4pWko5aa	they want war|`|L2QdPvSUaa	Do you mean Lebanon Hezbollah/Gaza Hamas? For both it's a matter of keeping their political face.|`|GDwMdfqjaa	To clear things up - Hezbollah is located in Lebanon, Hamas is located in Gaza. It is Hamas who is currently shooting rockets repeatedly, though in the last few weeks, there have been several rockets shot from Lebanon as well.<br>  <br>  When Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Fatah organization, who was considered a terrorist organization up to that point, decided to neglect the armed struggle, as Israel has taken a real and true step towards peace, and began negotiating with Israel diplomatically. The results of that negotiation were great, until Hamas commited a coup taking over Gaza completely, as it doesn't support peace with Israel.<br>  <br>  Hamas's goal isn't to have 2 nations living in peace side by side. Their charter which defines their ideology and goal states that the only way the conflict will end is with the destruction of Israel. Peace isn't an option.<br>  <br>  As their goal isn't peace but to destroy Israel, they'll never stop firing rockets and doing everything in their power to kill Israelies unless forced to using military power. Even their ceasefires are only temporary periods for them to re-arm. That's also why they said they won't sign a 10 year truce with Israel as Israel has suggested a month ago. Because they don't aim towards the end of the conflict but towards the end of Israel.<br>  <br>  Hamas chief Khaled Mashaal said Saturday that the Islamist group's request for a ceasefire with Israel was "a tactic in conducting the struggle." <br>  In an interview with Al-Jazeera, Mashaal explained that "it is normal for any resistance ... to sometimes escalate, other times retreat a bit. Hamas has implemented ceasefires in the past and has later resumed attacks, he pointed out, citing 2003 as a specific example. <br>  <br>  To get a pretty good idea of the face of Hamas, take a look at this video of Hamas suicide bombers preparing for their mission:<br>  <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=umlWYGLixPc&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=umlWYGLixP...</a>|`|adznfYe3aa	Because they don't care about civilians they are thugs and gangsters who get paid to attack Israel by Syria and Iran.

Honestly, I think most people are making a big deal about it because she's most likely going to need government assistance (unless she suddenly inherits a large sum of money or wins the lottery), so taxpayers think they're basically going to have to be supporting her family.|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	Because she made the deliberate choice, facilitated by a medical doctors, to more children, when she already had 6 she could not care for.  Usually, she does not have a husband who will help her care for and raise these children, who is all likelihood will show signs of developmental disabilities, which will require educational and therapeutic interventions that are costly and time consuming.  Parents usually are taught to provide and suppliment these interventions at home but this parent now how 14 children.  This is a huge task for two parents who are only care for one child who has a disability but it is monumental for a single parent without an income, whose support system, her parents, are angry that a doctor agreed to assist their daughter in getting pregnant in the first place.  Clearly this young woman has severe emotional problems that impair her ability to exercise good judgement.  Even couples who want many children usually try and make family planning decision based on their ability to financially meet their obligations to their children.  This woman did not do that but is instead looking for charity and government assistance.  Even if we were to rule out developmental disablities and the show financial resources, infants and young children need a great deal of one-to-one attention and physcial contact in order to achieve the best outcomes with respect to attachment and emotional development.  If left in the care of this woman, I fear these infants are doomed.|`|7tieiv6qaa	I don't know anyone who cares about it,<br>  but then, I also don't know any Oprah Winfrey fans.

GDwMdfqjaa	First of all - I'd just like to state I'm not an American but I do have a strong opinion of the topic.<br>  <br>  Cautious doesn't equal afraid. Remove the CIA, NSA and FBI, along with its intelligence helpful counterparts such as the Israeli and British intelligence agencies and you'll see just how far the rabbit hole goes. You'd have more fireworks than on the 4th of July. The fact is that there was one terrorist attack, not one terrorist attack ATTEMPT.<br>  <br>  Luckily, the intelligence agencies do their work effectively most of the time[I'll disregard their poor performance handling the intel regarding 9/11. And there was intel.] and similar attempts are prevented. But it'd take just a moment of the intelligence agencies taking their eye off the target, like they did in 9/11 and another similar attack would occur.<br>  <br>  It's easy to state "We're safe, there's not much of a threat" when you're comfortably sitting on your chair/couch enjoying life, not having a clue what really goes on under the surface. Read a few reports produced by intelligence agencies and you'll see hard facts regarding the hundreds, even thousands, of terrorist attack threats they handled and handle on a year-by-year basis. Not to mention the 20+ terrorist training camps[Feel free to search on that] located throughout the US as well as several terror cells.<br>  <br>  Of course, wearing a tin foil hat and building a bunker is highly irrational as well, but being cautious and aware of dangers has been proven to lengthen your life, not shorten it.|`|mVlRpc97aa	in two words, MEDIA BRAINWASH.   <br>  <br>  aided and abetted of course by the talking points of those politicians who are "owned" by the elite corporate interests that PROFIT from the war on terror.<br>  <br>  People should not feel in any way embarrassed if they have fallen prey to the brainwash.  The media has been engaged mind-manipulation experts for decades and they are very skilled at the techniques. Further, the brainwash started on the morning of September 11, 2001 when the population was in shock and mourning - states that make people vulnerable to brainwash.<br>  <br>  Your chances of getting struck by lightening are far greater than your chances of being injured from Arab terrorist attack.<br>  <br>  And while people remaining sleeping, our freedoms and privacies are continuously dismantled all in the name of the grossly overblown "war on terror".  The Founding Fathers must be rolling in their graves.<br>  <br>  <br>  3,000 Americans died on September 11, 2001.  MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIE IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF NEGLIGENCE OF DOCTORS.<br>  <br>  DO WE SEE A WAR ON DOCTORS?|`|adznfYe3aa	Because some day the bas***ds will get lucky and people will die.<br>  Plots are being foiled all the time, thank goodnes, but one day they wil succeed.<br>  I live in Britain and I know there are thousands of terrorists or supporters waiting to get a chance to kill in Britain or overseas. There are some so called British citizens fighting with the Taliban, they go to visit Pakistan allegedly and end up killing our troops. Others plot to blow up airports and restaurants.|`|uKTVCuOXaa	Indeed we are a liability to ourselves and our government are purposely stirring up other countries to make us all in debt to war forever...........Then some slippery people can determine our fate, energy, money, food and water supplies too this is the creepiest bit. <br>  They definitely do not want us to be independent of them, because then they couldn't control us with the old fear mongering propaganda and also divide us through our believe systems.<br>  <br>  RUBY Made a brilliant point about doctors I experienced such neglect and it nearly killed me if I had listened to them further I would be dead.|`|o1PuFnWmaa	Obviously you have no clue that this country is currently under a terrorist attack,  One from within rather than without.

Remember the Beirut barracks bombing, the first attack on the World Trade Center, and the US Cole? I guess not. The fact is these people (The radical Islams) want us dead. The hate the west and Israel. The wish death upon America. They are a serious threat. I'm afraid that the major of the people do not realize the treat they are to us. The want us dead, why cant you see that???<br>  <br>  The Radical Islams want us dead. We are different to them. They do not accept any other religion but their own, and they will kill you if you denounce Islam.  Try it sometime, go to an Islamic country and say Islam is lies. You'll be put in prison, or maybe put to death. Why does the government want us to be politically correct on this issue?  We are strangling ourselves with our political correctness.|`|7tieiv6qaa	I can't say I worry about it.<br>  There are a lot of really angry people out here. Some are angry because a small group of terrorists have really changed everyone's lives with very little effort around much of the world.<br>  Some spend time thinking of how life used to be, -before a bunch of religious freaks decided to do 911.<br>  You are incorrect on the number of terror attacks though.<br>  The WTC was attacked the first time, -almost exactly 16 years ago. The USS Cole was bombed and people died.<br>  I've lost track of exactly what has exploded in Europe over the last eight years and, frankly, these religious freaks have been pulling this sort of **** off since long before you or I got here.<br>  By the way, did you see the special on TV last night?<br>  I think it was called "Why Muslims cut off heads."|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Who's afraid. Are you saying we shouldn't have any kind of intelligence or defense from terrorists?<br>  <br>  Diamond: What freedoms have we lost?

5DkFFirWaa	1948; UN creates Israel a state mixed with territories of Palestinians and Jews. First day of creation there is war. Israeli's have took over all places except Gaza and West Bank. Palenstinians relied on their "Arab Brothers" to destroy Israel for many years. However, in the 80's Palestinians have resorted to their last hope; Terrorism. A 3 week skirmish between the 2 sides has just ended and Israel is chocking Gaza's aid from the UN. Hamas runs the show at the West Bank and considered a terrorist organization by the US and many other countries. There is also a fight on who controls Israel; for it holds extreme spiritual significance for Jews and Muslims. At the site of the Dome of the Rock lies Solomon's old temple. There is a large conflict on who controls this area.<br>  I also want to mention that there are 3 million Palestinians are considered to be homeless. No country wants them; even their "Arab Brothers" want them.|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	This newspaper is a good source>>>>>>|`|AS4pWko5aa	they are both sold weapons by countries so it is financially beneficial to some people that they kill each other <br>  <br>  they could resolve this themselves if outside interference would allow it|`|xdUjRxKzaa	History and bigotry between both nations. There are no winners and there are two losers and history in even another century will not change that unless the young women on both sides say 'we aren't going to raise cannon fodder, so s*d off to both sets of 'men'. Wow are the thumbs down going to wallop me but at my age i really don't care, well, actually i do, i care about both those nations who are being exploited by armaments companies who don't give a hoot about victims, responsibilities, degradation or anything else other than profit! What is wrong with the women in this world? Have they all tuned out of real life into the circus of consumerism and stupidity?

E' eccessivo e vergognoso il modo in cui i media si concentrano solo sull'11 settembre 2001, dimenticandosi di paesi meno noti e di situazioni più scomode. <br>  <br>  Ogni anno danno in tv quella serie di cortometraggi sull'11 settembre.

oDz0FQpEaa	I agree, the public didn't care too much for here before all this but suddenly bacause she's ill everyone has taken an interest. Hundreds of people die everyday from cancer but just because its someone who used to be on big brother we are all forced to read/see/hear about it everywhere. Its a terrible thing but I have just heard too much about it now.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Personally, no I am not. I never watched her on BB. I don't read the mags that foster 'celebrity status' because I just don't do 'celeb' following.<br>  However, you miss the point, yes there are many other mothers in the world who have cancer and die young but the thing is Jade has lived a great deal of her life in the media, where most do not. She is doing, in her soon to be death, the best she knows how to secure her children's future.<br>  Also, she is, by going public, raising awareness of cervical cancer. In doing so she may actually be helping many young women avoid developing the condition in the future.<br>  As a person who does not follow celebrities of any sort I actually think she is being very brave by publicising her plight. I also applaud her positive attitude under very traumatic conditions.<br>  I have to say that if you are "getting annoyed" with her "story" you need to learn some humility.<br>  Not all of us are blessed with intelligence. Jade accepts that she is not the brightest spark on the planet but she has done the best she can. And you know, for an "ignorant person" in her own words she has shown more intelligence than your question did.|`|5XyBxxYAaa	You have to understand she is someone the general public know so people take a lot more notice of someone like her making people aware of cancer, rather than just you or I.  My heart really goes out to her and her family.  She is a very brave girl in my eyes.|`|AA11049477	I think what bothers me more, is ms goody could easily afford private health care, she would have had up-to-date cancer curing treatments<br>  but chose to rely on the good-old NHS & what do you know........<br>  SHE'S dying.<br>  What sort of recommendation for our beloved NHS is that?|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	shes not young, one girl died from this at 25 and another girl was 17. <br>  <br>  But then again Jades the only one whos had this right, or at least thats what the media would have you believe right now|`|UBNEzh0Saa	Yes it's annoying.

It's valid. <br>  But I think there is alot of press with Jade because we all know who she is, we know her personality, we all watched her for 12 weeks in a house. We've watched her rise from there.. to become a millionairess<br>  <br>  It's like 'The Truman Show'<br>  <br>  Britain has watched her mature, become a Mother, a successful business woman. <br>  <br>  It's emotional.<br>  <br>  And when everyone is talking about Jade, I'm sure everyone IS considering ALL the women who've been in that situation, or are in that situation...

She meant nothing to me, she did not cost me a penny or the loss of one minutes sleep, her death will not alter that.<br>  <br>  However, I will leave her to die in peace and for one moment, I will reflect on the fact that she is leaving behind a young family.<br>  They have my sympathy, as do you, for it is obvious that your life is sadly lacking something that you must dwell on the ability of some soon to be dead celebrity who is able to hit the headlines.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day!|`|LIpCGz4oaa	i dont get annoyed about jade goody's story because i dont read it.  i read on line news and i dont click on jade. i use the mute button on tv news.  but  i have a lot of sympathy for any one dying of cancer especially for someone as young as jade.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yeah i guess.

Ci siamo messi insieme qnd lui aveva 14 anni e io 17 siamo stati insieme per più di un anno e se nn fosse sopravvenuta la distanza a qst ora staremmo ancora insieme....! Goditi qst esperienza! Ciao ciao|`|Sm0dsjnIaa	Non è che sono i tuoi amici che ti mettono in testa queste stupidaggini? Che ti dicono che è troppo perchè dedichi più tempo a lei che a loro? Che sono forse anche un po' invidiosetti?<br>  <br>  Segui il tuo cuore e non fingere: se ci stai bene dimentica questo dubbio, se te ne frega poco, non prenderla in giro.|`|UhtKpz7Baa	A mio parere se vi trovate bene insieme potete anke continuare sta storia, ma penso ke a 16 anni si debba ancora godersi la vita, uscire con gli amici, fare le cose ke si fanno con gli amici, ke magari la tua ragazza nn ti lascia fare... Poi, per carità, se la tua ragazza ti lascia fare quel ke vuoi meglio per te e allora tienitela stretta!<br>  Però ecco, secondo me devi anke divertirti!!|`|XgcMJxtDaa	perche` dovrebbe essere un problema?io con il mio ex ci sono uscita per 8 anni e quando ci siamo mollati ne avevo 23...si esatto da quando avevo 15 anni...ma nn me ne pento..|`|e3ssETdNaa	condivido con l altra risposta... se ci stai bene insieme che cazzo di discorsi fai...|`|gaJiBtQKaa	non è troppo e non è neanche poco se tu stai bene con lei non devi farti queste domande devi solo ritenerti fortunato di aver trovato una persona con cui stai bene  fin da ora che hai solo 16 anni.....|`|yiB9wkWGaa	xk dici qsto...?se state bene non centra niente l' età!!! e mi sembra assurdo farti venire le paranoie....!!!<br>  auguri ad entrambi :):):) un bacione cosimo s!!!
xpMCNpVraa	What people do not understand is that if/when a property is foreclosed on the borrower does not simply walk away with a FC on their credit.  At the beginning of the following year they get a 1099 and have to claim the banks loss as an income and then pay taxes on it. The IRS billing them is understandable, especially if they had unpaid taxes and the IRS placed a 2nd lien against the property.<br>  <br>  The other thing that people forget is that the borrower may ask banks for help, but they have to qualify for it.  Investors are not 'handing' the bank to people because they need help - they have to qualify by showing they can afford a lower payment/interest rate. If they do not qualify this way, or if there are 2nd liens on the property - often the banks hands are tied because the collateral can be FC on by the other lien holder(s) and the risk of loss all the way around is to great.  <br>  <br>  You have a couple of choices here;<br>  <br>  1) If your parents haven't been evicted yet and if you're in a "Redemption State" you might be able to redeem the property by making a years worth of interest payments.  You'll want to contact the FC attorney assigned by the investor to get answers to those questions - or look it up on the internet.<br>  <br>  2) Again, if your parents are still on the property they still might be able to sell it, possibly even a Short Sale which would mean getting an offer for close to Fair Market Value.  You can contact the REO of your parents loan servicer to inquire about this possible option.<br>  <br>  3) Move forward.  The FC is done.  I would inquire (if you haven't already) with that BK attorney to see if they do anything to reduce the debt owed to the IRS.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|goe3y4FPaa	type ''obama on foreclosures on ur ''google search engine'' or go to youtube.. and listen in ''slow motion'' u pin-head|`|5jAeD14zaa	search the internet or watch the news. He spoke about it last night|`|GiYUrUwxaa	You are looking for a place to find help with foreclosure issues, the first thing I would caution against is all of the people trying to sell a "quick fix" foreclosure solution.  Try a government housing counselor, find one through HUD or online you can try a resource website with links to government agencies that may be able to help in situations like this:   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.loanforeclosureinfo.com/resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.loanforeclosureinfo.com/resou...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck, sounds like a hard situation.|`|aa3d4b4b16cee140a4ed4cf932c06c50aa	here's one for you,i just read an article on a las vegas news website that  says,the chinesse want to come to america and buy houses,im thinking great,lets let them come over and buy all these houses,and then charge people to rent not buy,this was one way we got into this mess,we need to stop letting people buy mass houses just to rent or sell over what thier worth.|`|d6322d6851d8d95adc75a8613fec4e77aa	<a href="http://www.federalstopforeclosure.com/db949/?page=landing" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalstopforeclosure.com/db...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the one that I am looking into as I am getting close to the F word in housing!  Good luck to you also.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Es triste pero es la verdad, en Espa?a y Francia como en otros paises como Alemania y USA existe un racismo y discriminación cada vez mayor contra los sudamericanos. Para prueba en Espa?a nos dicen SUDACAS den forma despectiva, en cambio cuando vienen a Venezuela la mayoria de espa?oles se quedan y se casan con venezolanos y se les trata con respecto y deferencia como a todos los extranjeros y me molesta que a nosotros los venezolanos nos discriminen y nos digan sudacas. <br>  <br>  Ningun pais es mejor que otro, aunque sean una potencia, más bien deberían de demostrar su amabilidad y cortesia así como se les trata a ellos en otros paises. Pero se sienten superiores y lo maximo. Aunque no generalizo en Espa?a, ya que tengo amigos espa?oles y soy hija de espa?ol con hindu nacida en venezuela, pero me molesta la discriminación en todo sentido. TODOS SOMOS SERES HUMANOS Y MERECEMOS RESPETO. Y si algún sudamericano hace algo malo en otro país que lo castiguen, pero que no generalicen ya que en venezuela y otros paises también existen extranjeros que vienen a hacer da?o y no GENERALIZAMOS ni les decimos ESPO?OLETES O NAZISTAS, etc, como ellos nos dicen SUDACAS.<br>  <br>  <br>  VIVIR Y DEJAR VIVIR.....eso es lo que deberían de hacer y viajar y culturizarse para que vean que a sus gentes cuando se radican en otros paises NO SE LES TRATA MAL NI SE LES DISCRIMINA.<br>  <br>  Y A XIA LE DIGO QUE NO TENGO COMPLEJOS DE INFERIORIDAD, SOY PROFESIONAL HABLO 3 IDIOMAS Y SOY UNA MUJER PREPARADA, pero el que tenga ojos que vea. Con eso demuestra una vez más lo intolerantes y faltas de respeto que son. ACEPTEN QUE ES VERDAD!!!!!!!!|`|TL11HiSQaa	Este tema siempre sera muy interesante sin considerar adonde se practiquen esos malos sentimientos que son parte de la historia moderna...<br>  Por el momento prefiero no echar mas le?a al fuego y propongo  una respetable tregua.|`|hkeXjfqqaa	Manifestaciones racistas y Fascistas hubo hay y habrá en Occidente ,el tema es que a veces lo difunden y otras no. Ahora se le está dando bastante difusión a la cuestión.<br>  <br>  Alhanna:<br>  No veo como se puede interpretar lo mío como un aval al racismo ,repudio el racismo obviamente. Pensé que ni hacía falta andar aclarando ese tipo de cosas.<br>  Lo que digo es que cosas malas pasaron pasan y seguirán pasando y simplemente hay que castigar a los que se comportan incorrectamente, sin usar ciertos casos como excusa para fomentar el odio y demonizar a los espa?oles como hacen muchos "latinos" aqui . <br>  Supongo que mi posicion a vos no te conforma y pretendes pena de muerte a los racistas, que los latinos nos unamos y le "declararemos la guerra" a Espa?a o algo similar.<br>  La discriminacion no la inventaron los espa?oles, los yanquis o los argentinos como quieren hacer ver algunos insufribles por aquí: existe en todos lados ,en suecia en venezuela en sudan o en la china. <br>  Y Ya que estamos tambien repudio el maltrato y la generalizacion a que son sometidos los espa?oles en foros como este por "latinos" a los que les viven llenando la cabeza con zonceras.<br>  Un saludo Argentino.<br>  pd: en cuanto a cómo están recibiendo los Espa?oles a los Latinos creo que habría que ponerse en los zapatos de los Espa?oles también: de repente a ellos les están cayendo inmigrantes por todas partes como a ningun otro pais : se les vienen de Africa del Norte de Africa del Sur , Latinoamericanos , Europeos del Este...no me quiero imaginar como estaríamos los Argentinos o los de otros paises si tuvieramos que recibir un aluvion inmigratorio similar :justo nosotros que nos escandalizamos y maltratamos a los peruanos paraguayos y bolivianos que vienen aquí...
