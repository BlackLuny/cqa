HRJkHuw4aa	well, with out knowing the specifics of your problems its hard to say. the only thing I can suggest is to go for a jog/walk, walk the dog if you have one, or go to a friends house & talk about it, or just go hang out, go catch a movie, go draw or paint a picture. go buy some new CD's to listen to|`|15138853c1cb3b1c3ba1e3d5ca6a8aecaa	We will be able to help you better if you add some details and narrate some of the problems you faced recently.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	what kind of problems are you having at Home and school.

AA10451854	Without question, the most unanimously significant moment in my life was graduating from college at the University of Illinois at Chicago two years ago.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	Dancing with my dad a few hours into my wedding reception. By that time, all the pomp and circumstance was over and it was just a happy celebration-surrounded by the people I loved most and who mattered so much to me: childhood friends, family, coworkers, college friends, mentors, teachers, and my wonderful husband...and I realized the significance of the LOVE in that space. It made me remember all the more that THAT is what matters the most in this life-the love of the people in your life and how one must always be grateful and pay that love forward. I know that opportunities like that to have all your worlds collide in one space happen once, maybe twice in a life. And I am so grateful to have had a moment like that.|`|f180924fa608a1843cfd44f843639824aa	Being there at the moment when my children were born.
0Id85yiYaa	puhhhh--leeeezzz lady|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	If I didn't know any better, I'd think that this question is something I posted and somebody found it and re-posted it, because this is the exact way I used to conduct myself during my first marriage- about 8-9yrs ago. I lived my life as if I was single and I needed constant stimulation/excitement sexually. I never really lived off my husband because I was only out of work for a little while. I never lost a job but I was a stay at home mom for a while. That was the only time when I depended on him, and we lived that way at his whim. So, there are a few differences but overall, I get where you're coming from.    Now that I'm older and wiser, I see how wrong the mentality you have, and I had, is. You want to do your own thing but you're afraid to let go because you're emotionally dependent. I get that. But get this. All of what you think about your situation is kinda like a smoke screen. You ASSUME your man is supposed to give it to you because you're married but no where in your marriage vows does it says that your husband is supposed to financially support you. True, he can't literally make you get a job so while your basic needs (housing/clothes/food) will be taken care, when it comes to anything extra like getting your hair/nails done or buying new clothes, all of what you'll need you'll have to get from him and you could possibly be *** out. So, watch that dependent attitude. He does because he wants to, not because he has to. He's faithful to you because he wants to be, not because he has to be. He can CHOOSE not to do any of it and all the security you think you have now, will fly out the window.     There is so much more I can tell you based on my experiences living like that. I don't know if you have any idea of what kind of problems, living the way you are, can cause. Believe me, you do have other options but I can understand how you feel you don't. I don't wanna lecture you like a kid or tell you what you should do. I can tell you that if you keep it up, you're gonna lose out. The best thing for your situation is for you to move on and then you can live however you want. That's somewhat what I did. You've already pointed out that you know this, so I doubt you'd consider it. The next best thing is let your husband do his thing too and you guys have an open relationship.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	I don't.    But then again, I am not a big fat whore, either!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	This is exactly why your not supposed to get married at 21.  What the hell were you thinking??

However, if he is unaware of your infidelity, that is immoral and wrong, you are making him out to be a fool. You seem to only care about him as 'bound by paper'.    You are a disgrace and I feel for your poor husband. Hopefully he is doing the same thing to you.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I dont feel the same at all.    Im 20 and Im married, but i never feel like going out and dating other people, if i want to date, i go on a date with my husband.

I was married 20 yrs, but knew I couldn't cheat on him so I stuck it out until I knew I couldn't be there anymore. I did leave him after all that time before I moved on. You may love your husband, but not obviously as a husband. Your vows didn't mean as much to you.|`|n1AAHi5qaa	i hate lousy wives|`|j7l9gavRaa	how sad you are pathetic, you're husband is probably cheating on you too|`|ruczpWrGaa	My boyfriend and his kids went Thur exactly that.

I think that you can get these packages at your local grocery store or hardware store. Set packages around where you know they are coming in at.  The mice will chew through the package and eat the bait.  They will then go off and die.  I am not sure if there are different types of bait, but I believe that most dehydrate the mouse so when it does die it does not stink.  Now be forewarned that you may find a dead mouse somewhere if it decides to die in your closet.  However, I would much rather find a dead mouse then the mess that they create when they chew and crap all over everything.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Call an exterminator.

zUZRPmYAaa	Just try to give of your self as much as you can and be there for the other person.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Quality friendships cannot be made.  Its a personal thing, its both individuals that make a friendship have worth.  How they think, do they have any morals, are they mature, do they respect themselves, the list goes on.  Have relationships with people who share the same qualities, mind, etc. makes great friendships.  This can go both ways, you don't need morals, you can be ruthless, could give a damn about yourself neither the next man and have a great relationship with someone of the same mindset.  There you will feel comfortable and wont have to be responsible for any of your actions because the individual will understand due to the disfunction that you two share.  It's just a matter of time before that relationship will come to an end, and neither of them will care
RihPWIfBaa	He may be embarassed about getting caught, depending on your reaction. You may have blown it out of proportion as if he is a pervert or something and he isn't going to be able to be aroused with the thought in the back of his mind that you see him as a pathetic perv. He needs to feel like a man, and masterbating is seen as pathetic when a man does it. He's just a normal dude. He isn't lying to you or cheating on you when he's masturbating to porn. If you treat him like he is he'll feel like less of a man. which means no sex for you.

Making sure you will have great orgasm each times.|`|yWBmZrfAaa	Here is the definition of cheating- whatever you (the partner) feels is cheating.    Now, some people would have no problem with their mate watching it, however, many do.  If you feel like this is betrayal then you should calmly talk to him about it and explain that you feel he finds time for someone/something else and not you.  You feel you are being physically and emotionally betrayed for the sake of a computer image.  I think all too often our society tries to downplay the reality of it and the pain it can cause.  You are allowed to have those feelings.  After all, if it wasn't such a big deal why would so many couples have ended up in divorce court over it?    I don't think men realize just how emotional it is for women.  They seem to be regard it as something physical while it is an emotional betrayal to many women.     Now, if he doesn't seem to understand it might be time to examine the reality of your relationship.  Could you really continue dating him and deal with this type of behavior?  If the answer is no, perhaps it's time to move on.    Another thought, if he downplays your feelings you could always leave some magazines of men in your bathroom to see how he reacts to that.  I had a friend whose bf didn't understand until he was put in her shoes. He wasn't happy about it and she was able to explain to him it was no different than him.  After all, just like you want to be his "dream girl" he wants to be the "only man you need."  GOOD LUCK!
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	Why dont you have a threesome?

The only thing is that I've always felt that those send a valentines to class is kinda corny. It depends on your and her if you think it's not then go for it. If you do think it's kinda corny after I said it ''/ then you can get her a really cute card saying the same thing and leave it where she sits (get to class before her so you can leave it there). Make sure to put her name on it because I know that if I had a card in front of my desk and it didn't have my name on it I'd put it somewhere else ''/ (full name might even be better) this way you don't have to be like "ohhh no that's from me...read it" it would be kinda weird. Anyway if she says yes I think it would be cute if you left her balloons and flowers by her dorm, house, or car.  Good luck!!!!!!|`|yWBmZrfAaa	I think it is a cute idea!!!|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Hmm...it would be really awkward of you to give it to her during the class you share with her. Because if she doesn't want to go with you, she'll feel weird looking over and being like, "Uh, no." Maybe do it in a lower-pressure situation where she can give you a natural, unbiased answer. Extremely cute idea, though. Good luck!

I've had one of those and because the water bed is in constant motion you have nothing solid to bounce off of making less "impact" in the pumping and grinding.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Waterbed=pain in the a$$!  For one, there's no difference on sex, they are horrible to sleep on because if you move in your sleep your wife has to feel every bit of your move waving under her.  Oh and when they leak big mess, ruins carpets.|`|aXYiOskmaa	doesn't make a difference.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Lousy.    Water-beds not only cause havoc while love making (even the wave-less) but they don't adequately support your back. You wind up getting lousy sleep.    I'd go for one of those nasa foam beds (temperpedic?). I understand that you can get 5 hours of sleep and it feels like 8 because you don't stir.     But water-beds....not a good idea    Good Luck!|`|j7l9gavRaa	i have had sex once on a water bed when i was a teen i didn't like it it was too wobbly and made things difficult|`|OBCvewW2aa	waterbed=bad back|`|ed3eK4mHaa	It isn't the bed, it's the person you're with.    Had it both ways. Preferred the guy, not the bed.|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. Does not improve he sex life. Harder to use your legs! Instead of moving your body up and down like on a mattress, they will just sink into the water bed. A lot harder to have sex on one.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	waterbeds are scarey you never know when they will pop...|`|f6YsGOynaa	Worse if you move around alot and use gravity to help the friction.  If you have a waveless style bed, all you will end up doing is squishing against it when you're trying for the fullest penetration in missionary.  If you have the old style that makes waves, it can mess up your rhythm.  Save your money for other props... this is why nobody has waterbeds anymore.  They are NOT conducive to decent sex.|`|aGXankr2aa	Openness and communication with your partner = better love life.|`|3hEa481faa	umm not for us we pop-ted it lol... that was a disaster lol|`|wlupqLrBaa	Honestly I have no idea, but I wouldn't mind trying it and good on you for spicing it up x|`|f6a177061a935df6ab959c2ecb265589aa	Not better, just different. You have to go with the natural waves of the water or you get bounced around (in a distracting way).    Also, it is a challenge to for two to *sleep* in a waterbed. Every time someone rolls over, they create waves for the other person.|`|yy45iAbtaa	if you get a motionless one it would be ok.but if you don't they go all over the place good luck and happy water logging.|`|dtHjJah5aa	It is terrible for love making!!|`|PG41yML9aa	sounds pretty kinky now you got me thinking about one lol!!!|`|g37eLIxgaa	I've had one for a while, but really did not do much for our physical side.  It is too soft and moves too slow.    ***MILDRED IS MY LEADER***
y43tzOQlaa	Sounds like you didn't like him to begin with, so there are already some issues. If you don't  have mutual communication and respect in any living situation it's a no win situation. He needs to contribute if not financially then he can do the house & yard work. Everyone has to pull their own weight. Have a house meeting.|`|wBHtrGchaa	Just tell him to get a job, so he can be gone.  :]|`|LGPOESonaa	tell him to start being independent
vUVxS9Xhaa	Talk respectfully to the woman and dont sit there gawking at her cleavage...    Give gestures that are friendly/caring as opposed to sexual...you have to make her think you are interested in what she has to say and how she feels.     You might even think i want to drill this woman in the back of your mind but you gotta be subtle about it...do not bring it up and when you are both alone in a private place slowly make a move.|`|Molu004zaa	Just don't bring it up till wayyy into the relationship, or until she mentions it first. Duh? :/|`|NBXY35zPaa	Just stand there with your lil weiner hangin out, that should be a clear message. I'm sure you'll get the same amount of women that you did before.|`|4WszPA0Paa	Don't have sex till shes the one who jumps on you... pretty much the most obvious reason    Depending on the girl.. she already has a preconcieved notion of ur intentions... just be yourself and take her on the right dates and she'll eventually get to know you... if ur sincere about it then she'll get you    really it cant hurt to just be upfront and tell her... be suttle in conversation and say something like the 40 year old version movie... "we cant have sex till the 25th date" or w/e u want     Don't be prudy because that shines through on ur personality but maybe delay it for a few days untill she initiates it then just go buck wild    Ur probably the kind of guy who respects women and is content with a good convo so im not even worried about the gestures or language u use... she'll be turned on even more when u flip the switch and seduce her  Have Fun|`|tJ6N1IyZaa	you can't make us believe otherwise cuz with our experience men just want sex....every guy I know just wants to **** me....I hate that.....I want a man that loves me for me not what I can do.|`|fDhOFwX9aa	Tell her that you love her not because she is pretty and hot but because she is smart( or something else), and you feel happy when she is around.  Then bring her to do some of your or her favourite past time that suitable, sports or reading in bookstores. Spend quality time together and talk heart to heart.
iAGR2jB5aa	Talk to her calmly and tell her how this makes you feel.|`|2eHFbEstaa	you need to talk to her about your feelings and why its bothering you so much...|`|OxoumjYJaa	I agree. I think you need to talk to her about your feelings.|`|f8uXyJcUaa	i think u should to talk to  all of them. ur  bother and sister's attitude and tell ur mom how u really feel.
SmjfBcuZaa	Vouchers for her favourite shop ? .   Perfume ?   Tickets to a gig ? .   Make-up ?|`|4oE7jlfcaa	why dont you get her some girly stuff.. like a perfume and lotion gift set or some mani/pedi stuff.
Nvx9rMSqaa	I like both, may be the short one is more in...|`|Z7dnzyk7aa	i think you should go blond! just my opinion.|`|s6e4bqahaa	Either way Babe,you're a HOTTIE!|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	Long hair is always better for ........
nS83ag9raa	tell this person they arent the only person to ever feel like sh*t    many peopel feel like sh*t everyday and still manage to get up and go to work and go about their lives..    person sounds a bit self centered
1wWSzEAOaa	my sister rode the bus with this really cute kid who is 17, and lives like right next door to our house, and she introduced us, and ever sense then, we kinda hit it off, i mean we go on dates here and there, but we mostly just chill at his or my place....all thanks to the annoying little sister!!! lol, nice story? lol i think so!!! lol|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i met her at a bar, at a xmas party that i didnt really want to go to, but at the last minute someone convinced me. it was cool. she was obviously underage to be in the bar, but w/e we wennt out for almost 2 years|`|pJ3TNB6uaa	First love... way back when... on a Trip actually during the summer
Cv2h6n1Raa	Hell yea! Take any chance you can to kick a guy in the balls|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	You have a seriously sick fetish with this.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	**** if he splitted the money wit me.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	hell no that is so wrong and stupid i would never do that even for 50 dollars|`|LGHMmRVFaa	YEAH|`|YtSGbYqEaa	yeah thats funny|`|XVygEWLcaa	um yah. if he's actually wanting to do this then that makes him an idiot and you dont want stupid people procreating. so yes, kick him in the nuts
g2QUNwZzaa	idk, it seems like it happens with me and my friends too. none of them call me anymore, and on the rare occasion we actually hang out. they'll be like "hey you remember a few weeks ago when ***** did this" and im like, no...no one told me|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	Honey, I've been there. Welcome to the wonderful world of immature girls. They are doing this because they are jealous of you and they are trying to control the situation and leave you out because they don't want you stealing any of their thunder. Please just be confident and do things on your own for a while. It will be hard, but you don't need them. Eventually, they will start talking to you again and pretend it never happened. They are very immature and this is what happens everywhere. I remember my cousin told me that they were just jealous of me and I believed her. Eventually, they all wanted to hang out again. Just don't worry and know that it's nothing about you. They are bored and immature and trying to hurt your feelings. Don't let them. Keep smiling!|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	become one of her victims and you will have the life you were warned about!|`|aKkDWz5Waa	ask them why they r doing this. if they care, they will realize that they have been hurting u. if u find out they dnt, honestly, try starting a new friendship.    ugh, life can suck. GOOD LUCK!!|`|AA10529198	Best thing that you can do, is give in to peer pressure.    Really suck up to the most popular girl in your school.  Do things for her, get her gifts, etc. - - Then, you can try to make another girl (preferably the girl that was trying to steal your friend) the outcast.    When you do that, make cruel jokes about her appearance, her family status, etc.  (e.g. does she wear glasses, have braces ? is she fat ??, etc.) Make her the biggest loser in the world, instead of you.  The other girls will think that is hysterical, and you will be more popular than you ever were.    If that does not work, getting an older boyfriend, and doing things that they do (sex, drugs, blowing off school, etc.) - That is always a clear road to popularity with the other girls.    This has a down-side, and I recommend that you watch the movie (classic) Fast Times At Ridgemont High -
IPS3hWweaa	No, you should stay in your house and only go outside to get food. She is way beyond you and if you try you will be rejected big time. Sorry, but I told her about your post.|`|XVygEWLcaa	you are a pig|`|4awRMWFzaa	**** off noob
4fCTqxkIaa	I kinda thought you would get one or two of those answers.. I usually see at least one when i answer your q's.. But to answer your question, i think you should get someone to give you a hug and just be yourself. You usually sound pretty happy and energetic on here so just act like yourself. I'd give you a hug but, one, it would feel kinda akward cuz i dont really know you, and two, im like 500 miles awy from h-town.. Hope you feel better!|`|IhfdkCnjaa	marijuana|`|XVygEWLcaa	drink|`|WAHNf3bAaa	Listen to gary numan|`|gziPYaenaa	WOW you look really sexy baby, I mean I love your eyes WOW|`|BrfWjPGNaa	say "choo-choo train" 3 times|`|rVsTnC8Baa	Hey, I'm sure you know like most people feeling miserable is easy .. nothing bad even has to happen ITS A CHOICE and you want to know something else feeling happy is a CHOICE as well ... now this might sound wierd but I'm going to give you a happy ball .. put your had out .. count to three and on three a imaginary ball that represents happyness will apear ... now at the bottom I'm going to put a curnal size bead that represents worry .. this curnal doesn't matter or interfear but you know its there and it does nothign good for you... worry happens when there seems to be no other option ..  .. now look at your happy ball and see that its just the right size to compensate for all your worries and unhappyness ... now everytmie you feel bad or need a boost to feel happy look at your happy ball and it can also be any colour you want it to be ...       P.s. Now pretend to be happy and put a "fake" smile on your face .. even fake happyness can be real .. b/c you cant feel happy and down at the same time it doesn't work ... just remember that you are the one who should be in control     P.S.S i'm not sure if i explained this right but i hope i did .. best of luck..PEACE|`|Qxir7i58aa	Have a good laugh, that makes everyone feel better.

I'm not very happy either. Your gorgeous though and it makes me happy to tell you that.|`|V8Fpgd9maa	Hey Saril,     I agree with you, a lot of these answer are sick,  perverted and illegal.     So what is going in your life where you feel a need to come here to talk about?    Feel free to elaborate.  Willing to try and help.    Short of that, here are some articles I pulled.    Important Ways To Create Happiness  http://ezinearticles.com/?Important-Ways...    Happiness Takes Work: 5 Choices to Create Happiness  http://www.infidelity.com/index.cfm/even...    Some quotes:  "Everyday is your Superbowl."  --- Tony Robbins    "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."  --- Albert Einstein     "Have convictions. Be friendly. Stick to your beliefs as they stick to theirs. Work as hard as they do."  --- Eleanor Roosevelt     "Every wall is a door."  --- Ralph Waldo Emerson     "Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy."  --- Leo Buscaglia     This one cracked me up:  "Love is a serious mental disease."  --- Plato    and this one has always been my favorite:  "...and Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth."  --- Mark 9:23|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	Go up and kiss some random guy and then walk away.|`|860ff941920615ee66e9f9302110ef42aa	do things which makes you happy
Wlh3b2vXaa	well it seems like he has a very immature group of friends. if they really cared about him they would tell him their ophioins in private and not act like little girls to try to get you mad. in fact, they might even all like him themseleves, you never really know. i think he does like you alot and he is willing to do the secret thing to be with you but it seems like he doesnt have enough respect for you to firmly make his friends stop teasing and being mean to you. tell him that you want something to change or this just isnt gonna work. make sure he knows that you really want to be with him and are willing to anything but those girls are hurting any chance you guys are gonna get in being together|`|6bcc3be9b24054d6785731010b83e4f5aa	wow this is really difficult. i dont know on what areas they tend to not like you. maybe do as your bf says - spend some time alone - i mean its brilliant he is seeing you just the two of you isnt it? if you dpont like his friends, they dont pain yourself by making extra effort to please them. they will only see you as weak minded and pushover! its him you like so dont mind his friends!
tQ4tCqDxaa	I'm sure he's problably feeling the same way u are. Ask him what is it he feels for u. Then just let things happen naturally from there.|`|xqan4ChSaa	ah i remember the old days well just tell him ok?
rZGJJ26vaa	a agree that there should be more option in the world and that a lot of people would be happier that way.    but i love the idea or love. and i am in love with a great man, and he is very satisfying to me and i need no one else. and the idea of him with anyone else would drive me insane because i am a very jealous person.    i think that's what holds people back. like animals humans have territory. we like to protect and keep what is ours, that's why money was invented so we wouldn't have to share everything and could claim what was ours. just like in relationships there is a certain amount of claim which is why marriage has the symbol of the ring, so people know to 'stay away'    however its not for everyone and that's okay. it shouldn't be looked down upon in society in my belief.|`|Y2sDswLBaa	Move to Salt Lake City|`|xgJbxZgfaa	b/c 2 half's = a whole duh!    and b/c i don't like sharing!!!|`|MV88rqDPaa	well to tell you the truth some people just want some one to cuddle uo with and love some people just want somebody near them when nobody but that one person will understand them|`|OHfZFR31aa	Because as soon as there are more than 2 people involved, there will always be jealousy and insecurity. One person is always going to feel left out or that they are second best.
vtW3qPZmaa	It's always a hard question to answer if you don't know the person wearing it, but from how enthusiastic and excited you are about your gown you'll look lovely in it.  Any dress is exquisite when worn by the right person, projecting the right energy, just as any dress can look truly dreadful when matched up with the wrong bride.  You and your dress are going to have a great day.    I actually ended up with a dress that I hated on the rack but looked amazing once I put it on http://www.madonna.pl/en/lasposa.php?s=1... - it really is true that in a lot of cases people just don't see all the features of a gown until it's on the bride.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	wow, are you getting married in 1812?|`|4POGapREaa	Ooh.

Those are just too over the top!"  So yeah, I think your dress will be really pretty when it's complete and I'm actually quite curious as to what it would look like.  I like the bodice and I think that lace in the front is really pretty.  Very unique.|`|cyht3kSvaa	gorgous[!!] i love it|`|NmtgziADaa	I think its really different and vintage looking I love it.

I don't think your truly ready for a relationship at least not this one. If he doesn't go anywhere with you or show you the affection you need then it won't work, you'll always be looking to fill that need. Sleeping with someone else isn't going to change what is wrong it will just put it aside for a while. It just complicates your already complicated mind. Good luck|`|o2WxTgfjaa	Yah, horrible idea!  if hes not showing affection when you two are together...or interest at all...why are you too still together then?  and if you have to convince yourself that you miss your boyfriend...that's not a good sign    well, if you cheat, there's a good chance the relationship will end then and won't really have to worry about much then...
AA11309717	Let me give you some perspective.  When a person is repeatedly treated in a certain way whether they want to be treated that way (if they allow themselves to continually be treated that way) they begin to get used to it, they adjust to it. When something different comes along  they either can't cope or feel that it would be such an upheaval from what they have known previously that they can't ever imagine living differently.    This to me, sounds like what your friend is experiencing. He's used to being controlled and what you offered him sounds good but he's more comfortable being controlled.    Take care|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	It's perfectly normal to tease without sex. That's what his right hand is for. He sounded nuts all along - and luckily he's transferred his craziness to some old bat now.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	yes, you cant tease a guy like that and not give him nothing. they do get angry about that.|`|JCdBSULraa	Sounds like a relationship I had with a rich girl I met on the internet.  I'm not too poor financially, but this is the kind of person who has enough money to do anything they want.       She was really cute, and somewhere deep down, she had the same values as me, but she was just too immature, and I consistently went for women that were less attractive than her because frankly I just felt that she wasn't for me.  Later she revealed herself to be much younger than she claimed to be, she said she just turned 18, when she had told me she was 18 2 years prior.    I understood why she lied, but wished she hadn't, so I kept talking to her.      Unfortunately, now that she's 18 she's lost the innocence that I admired about her, and in many ways is somewhat of a whore, so I stopped talking to her altogether.    It sounds like you were a lot closer to this guy though, so I doubt my experience would be that helpful, but social status is about a lot more than money, it's also about values and feeling that both people are right for each other.|`|hitKzYhBaa	Unfortunately sex was a very important issue in a relationship to  this guy. I feel he thought maybe after awhile in the relationship  you would give in. If there was foreplay he could not take the tease.  And that's why he moved on. Remember guys will say anything to  gain you trust including that famous "I love you". That's why he seems  crazy now to you. I do not believe he was truthful to began with. I hope  you are not hurt by what I have said but its real.|`|RSPZj5yeaa	When a guy says, "No...sex isnt important",  he really means, "Sex is very important and if you dont already know that then I am going to go looking elsewhere if you dont start doing something more than teasing me"    It does sound a lot like he had some self confidence issues with you, and something inside him told him to get out now instead of wait too long and really screw things up with you.   Win win for both of you if you ask me.|`|uZt2eLUqaa	I had an ex similar to yours who was very negative and had low self esteem..he was also very controlling and mentally unstable, i don't think you did anything at all, he was a weirdo to begin with.|`|vWWwOmDjaa	I highly doubt you had anything to do with him acting totally nuts now but maybe the teasing was a bit much, even though i do it, but the difference is i'm not a virgin. He's gunna have a hell of a time with this woman...she has 2 sons and was married once before. Not exactly the way i'd go. He sounds like a player when he said he needed more love because he said you're different than all his other ex's and he loves you. If he loved you then he would've waited until you were ready and he wasn't man enough to wait.|`|4QizPDQNaa	choosing not to sleep with him is perfectly fine, but teasing him  wasn't a good idea. other than that it seems to me that he already had low self-esteem and probably some other personal issues if he keeps going back to women like the ones who've hurt him before. sounds like he was really in it for the sex, unfortunately, and when he didn't get that he was ready to move on to whomever would give it to him. don't worry--you didn't make him nuts. i know how it is--he's had bad relationships in the past, but he claims that it's different with you and you care about him and try to encourage him, etc. then when he doesn't get what he's expecting, he starts making excuses and next thing you know, it's over. i wouldn't lose too much sleep over this guy. if he and his friends think it's funny to boast about this new woman and insult you, he really isn't worth your time. you need a guy that you don't have to "fix." nobody's perfect, but when people have real issues, relationships usually just serve as temporary band-aids on a gaping wound.
OHfZFR31aa	Send him a handwritten note and tell him you are sorry you broke up with him, you acted like an idiot, and you hope that he will take you back because you made the biggest mistake of your life. Sending an actual card or letter is so much more personal and meaningful than a text or email|`|Q27cXlGbaa	first of all, why are you acting like u hate him? thats just immature. tell him you made a mistake and that you do really love him and want 2 be with him. and see if he still feels the same way about you.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	u better tell him, b/c he might not feel the same if it's too late when or if u ever tell him.. and say sorry!|`|8lzBktaeaa	Be true to yourself, if you really do love him, fight to have him back in your life. But dont fool yourself, really ask yourself, am  I really in love with him|`|vtafeEIJaa	call for a reunion ..|`|AA11963868	I can tell you a place where you can get all the answers to your problems.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Go to a hardware store and browse the paintchips. You should be able to find colors there that work with royal blue that you both like.|`|hkwBR1moaa	red or yellow.  I wouldn' t go with both|`|4POGapREaa	Why does there have to be a theme?  That concept is so strange to me.  Have him in his uniform, the bridesmaids in the royal blue, you in white or ivory, and do a mixture of blue flowers with some white & some greenery.  An actual theme isn't necessary.  Just make it classy.|`|sGP6s7uraa	You can still do "spring" in royal blue.  Pair the blue with sunny yellow and crisp white.  It will look gorgeous.      http://www.theweddingplanningaudiocast.c...    http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2546...    http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mVNQFjdp3b0/SE...  This one is my favorite.  It has clean lines like the military.    If you like pink:  http://www.dcnearlyweds.com/uploaded_ima...|`|4lL34wJnaa	Yellow is definitely a happy spring-time color.  Actually blue and yellow would make an excellent combination.  As for a theme, your theme can be your colors, or an abstract idea, or something unrelated to the colors.      My theme is "Fun Hearts."  Our colors are light blue and white.  My fiance and I are very untraditional and are doing some untraditional things.  I have also woven hearts throughout everything at the wedding.  We have hearts on our invitations, we got placecard holders that are bells with hearts for handles, and our centerpieces are going to be vases with glass beads lit up from the bottom with fish in them and will have light blue stands and mats embroideered with white hearts under each one (my mom does embroidery).    You can pick anything and weave it through regardless of color!  Your theme could also just be color!  It's your decision!  Good luck!|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	Okay for colors white silver and gold would all work and for themes just figure out what you want and put it together individually if need be i went with a medieval theme myself with royal blue silver and white it was my husbands idea not mine but it came out well|`|T4uNeAKZaa	Was is the theme for?  Do you mean you can't find any royal blue dresses?  Or "themes" that would go with your royal blue dresses?|`|stiEynPbaa	I would pick out something unique to go with it. If you're stuck for another color, find an object. Like bamboo, or something.  Maybe... tie in pearls with the royal blue.     That would be pretty! Have some deep blue flowers with baby's breath, and tie them together with a creme ribbon and some pearls! Have all your bridesmaids wear pearl neclaces and dangly [or not] pearl earrings. You could get creative with it.     If you really wanted another color... I'd go with creme.|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	An Apple Red with the Dark blue would be very pretty and patriotic.
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	It sounds like you are also staying with him because it's convenient. The reason I say this is because you said "I cant leave him cuz im use to being there". You are used to being with him. You cannot continue with the drama. Do you guys have children together? If not, run dont walk out of that relationship. You need to lay the law down to him and say look if your parents cant respect me for the adult that I am and the relationship we have then you are going to have to leave him. He has to put his foot down to his parents. Thats where it has to start and no not everything will be picture perfect but atleast you wont be disrespected and screamed at.|`|AGbusTqGaa	You can end the relationship and let him know that no matter what happens you will still be there emotionally for him.  If things aren't going well though you can't stay with him just bc you think he needs you.  You need to put yourself first, it's clear that you have put him first for a long time by staying with him for this long.|`|AA11309717	you need to break up with him. You say he's lied to you about stupid stuff, well what do you think he'll do when it comes to important stuff? The drama at home maybe because he's lied about you to his parents (?) Maybe that's why they don't like you..    I know you feel like you need to be there for him, but truth is that  no matter what you do you can't live his life for him. He needs to take care of whatever is going on with his mom and dad and himself before he can be any good for you. This is driving you crazy I can tell but this is no good for you, take a step back and tell him you can't keep going through this. It's not fair to either 1 of you. Tell him you can't deal with the drama on a daily basis    Good Luck!|`|Nqda6ulSaa	well do you see a future with him? is he the one? ask yourself these questions|`|6bcc3be9b24054d6785731010b83e4f5aa	this guy doesnt seem like he's worth it.i know its gonna be difficult but everything fades as time passes. if his family doesnt like you then you probably dont want to be around his family either. this guy lies so he doesnt deserve you either!c|`|fDhOFwX9aa	Is there anything you can do to change the situation? Why his parents dont like u? Well, you can tell him that you love him very much, but his parents do not like you, so, you are ready to let him go if this could make him feel better, and you will still be there for him if he ever needs you. Then let him decides la.|`|7a7a3Wbmaa	i think you should try to work things out but seriously sit there and talk to him. i can tell you love the guy and you want to be with him and two years is a long time. but try to make a time where you two can just sit down and talk about everything. lay everything down on the table leave nithing out.|`|ZWN3JJ4Iaa	I think deep down you know the answer to your question, sometimes it just takes time to face up to it.  Are you really happy where you are and do you see yourself with him in 5 years time? Sometimes it hurts to love and separation may only seem like a last resort now but long term it might change everything. Life is about chances, all those 'what if's' in a few years to come and you might find yourself regretting the path you went down. What if you stayed and resented the fact you wasted another two years with a man whom you learn to realise that you couldnt live with and love or even worst not the person you fell in love with originally. I'm sure you have the rest of the life to find someone, someone who loves you, for whoe you are. And if you did break up and there was still feelings after some time then maybe its meant to be. I guess what I am trying to say is don't restrict yourself and look after number one! Good luck - I'm sure you will make the right choice! x

I would at least rate myself as a 8.  Men tell me that I am attractive and I carry myself well. I'm also told that I am very lady like.  Race goes both ways.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Men always check women out - it's not a race thing. I have construction guys outside my building replacing water mains and they always comment about me whenever I go in or out of my building, and they are all white guys. It doesn't matter if I'm in a dress or sweats - they still make comments. I think I'm ok looking, not gorgeous or anything. I look a lot like my avatar according to my friends.|`|03GQ637Raa	R U 4 reallllllllllll|`|k2P7LkWgaa	mostly asian guys like me  i dont know why,  hahaha|`|Sv62SsxXaa	all the time. respectfully. ive been told im attractive, a little skinny though. i would also consider myself classy, simply because i respect myself to the fullest. puerto ricans and dominicans tend to hit on me the most, mainly because i look more on the hispanic side then the white side.|`|dIYj73zHaa	I "check out" women of all races, but I mostly hit on latin women- I'm latin.|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	I am not white.|`|7sxGW40qaa	I don't really know how often, but it is always respectfully because I demand it.  You have to if you are a little white girl, sorry, but it's so true.  I believe I am attractive.  Probably an 8.6 or somethin.  I really don't know about classy, but I suppose so.  Mostly mexicans actually.|`|0gdBjXb1aa	honestly...a lot..it's usually like "what;'s your name", "can i get you number", "i wanna get to know you"...so it's nice  I think im pretty attractive...but you can judge my pic  lol  I am classy...and i have white guys, blacks guys...whole bunch of guys|`|iZDsMCghaa	I get checked out very often, sometimes I dont notice and my husband mentions it to me but I notice multiple times while Im out. Sometimes men look away when I look back but many actually dont, they keep staring, thats odd.  I get hit o(to what I would call getting hit on a few times a month) but my husband has different thoughts on what is considered being hit on, idk,maybe men have mysterious ways.  I have a wedding ring so its not often Im actually asked out. Id say,a few times a year.  Most always its respectful. Only a couple times has a guy crossed the line between flirting and being disrespectful and actually the last time was an advance from my friend's husband.  I wouldnt put myself at an 8 but considering all things Im averagely attractive. Ill leave it to others to rate me,lol.  Classy? Well, classy as in I dont fall all over men but not uptight by any means, not considered trashy or overly conservative, Im appropriate for my surroundings and whether Im with my kids or alone or just with my husband.  What race hits on me most? I wouldnt say theres one race, mostly white but I live in an area thats mostly white. When I lived in Florida, it was defiantly more even as far as races go but I will say in the two states(mass and Florida) I get(got) hit on differently. In Florida it was more "hey baby lemme get yo digits" or "you fine as f*ck"lol. In Massachusetts Its more "your a knock out, wow your beautiful" or just general flirting.  In Massachusetts, its more subtle flirting. I guess you can say Mass is more classy in that way.
Bo49sEX2aa	He has low self esteem right now, you dumped him.  He will take whatever he can get so he isn't alone.  You said it was a mistake, do you want him back? If so, tell him that the both of you need to go to counceling and address some issues of why you broke it off in the first place.  If you don't want him back, who cares who is dating, don't take it personal that he is dating a fat slob.  He is broken hearted and thinks low of himself right now.  Move on and don't tease him about it, it has nothing to do with you.|`|0Id85yiYaa	he wants to have his cake and eat it, too. it shouldn't matter if the girl he's seeing is overweight. perhaps he likes someone to talk to instead of just look at. shallowness is a turn-off for a guy. i'm not trying to be mean, just telling you how you're coming across and hopefully help you.|`|b26NgqOFaa	I've done worse things for free drinks.

I think jocks are unattractive.    They try too hard, and usually are cocky.    I looove Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone.

I just want 2 points :P|`|NEfezEUQaa	yes it can.  but it's not a good idea to live w/ your "other" when you're not married.  I'm certain that you are referring to the movie "Fireproof", but it is meant for marriages, you realize?  It is a good thing that you care about your "other" enough to want to take on the Love Dare, but I still recommend that you get married before living together.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Love Dare????
f9sL3WgQaa	I think its a sign of strength. To be strong enough to take control of your life and "make your life" not sit and and ignore the problems.    To me if you stayed and ignored your issues or allowed someone to continue to cheat on you instead of divorce...thats weakness!|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I think it all depends on the reason behind the divorce. If the person files for divorce simply because they no longer love the person, cannot get along, it wasn't what they expected, etc. then YES by all means its a sign of weakness and/or laziness.  If the divorce was filed due to abuse, adultery, abandonment, etc. then no, I think it was filed under good judgment and for good reasons.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	No.  And as for the bad judgement comments.  Sometimes that is true but sometimes people really change in a bad way.  The woman who marries a drug abusing womanizer has bad judgement.  The woman who marries a man who seems to have a slightly below average sex drive and then it turns out he is gay - heck how would you know?|`|AnW3dzQfaa	It is if you actually don't try to make the marriage work.  To me it's more a sign of giving up.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Not necessarily.|`|k73IxCHaaa	It use to be viewed as that back in the 50's and 60's, and there were a lot of miserable people staying married for the wrong reasons. Today it is the norm rather than the exception and I don't think many people view it as being weak. I do however think that a number of people get married for the wrong reasons, or more importantly only see what they want to see.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	No, it just shows you're starting over in life.  Never weakness.|`|gWYArJ0Haa	No, its means that someone is the relationship is sick of the constant bull*hit in the relationship. It shows that one person has tried their hardest to make it work and the other didnt give it their all or doesnt care anymore..|`|8F3IHGADaa	No, it's a sign of knowing when to accept your losses and move on.    Staying in a terrible relationship is a sign of weakness, IMO, because you're too weak to realize, "Hey, I deserve better. I'm leaving."|`|OikNR8Ufaa	no, it can be a sign of strength for realizing it's not working and being sensible and strong enough to let go so that both parties can move on and find the right person. But it depends on the situation I guess, if you give up right away at the first sign of trouble then I guess it's weak.|`|aXYiOskmaa	if you're divorcing because marraige takes work then yes.|`|98NiEivhaa	well i dont think so.... its not always a mutual thing    my ex created it all in my case, i tried to help it and to prevent it, but she had her mind made up, so all i could do was to accept it... doesn't say much about me... her definitely, but i was left without control or options|`|96zZlJVYaa	never! there is no weakness in a person when they have to end their marriage. A divorce to me is a sign that the love, caring, and passion to be with that individual is gone. Often most of divorce occur base upon the mature of the individuals, how to talk to each other, how to handle crisis together, being support of one another, share their vision of what marriage to them, etc but never a sign of weakness.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Absolutely no! Its how he or she can handle things at a Professional Level!|`|sDHxandWaa	Not necessarily. It all depends on the reasons leading up to the divorce. Some people honestly should just not be married.|`|9ZTADEzTaa	Amanda E said EXACTLY what i was going to say    edit: Divorcees giving me thumbs down. Haha. Keep fooling yourselves|`|ecNeN0staa	It's more often a sign of absolute hatred.|`|bqFk1du8aa	No,think about it this way, It could be a sign of strength.  It's hard to be alone when you're not use to it.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	No, I don't know what it is but I hope to never have to get divorced.|`|yy45iAbtaa	it is a sign that you should of thought about it more before getting married but we all learn from our mistakes next time you will be more aware.|`|URC8QzN4aa	no, every situation is different, but sometimes it takes strength and courage. sometimes the weakness is staying in a bad or unsafe marriage.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	No, I don't think so. It's a sign that the two involved have grown apart and want a life that's happy! It's never an ideal solution (at least most times), but it's better than making each other miserable. Giving up too soon though is the weakness. If you've gone through everything you know how to do, and it's still the same way, then it takes strength in my  eyes to move on.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Only the strong survive a divorce.    ADD:  Nothing's shocking:  Here's hoping your husband abandons you (and takes the pick-up).|`|pma90Xycaa	I wouldn't say it's a sign of weakness, but I think people turn to divorce a little too soon.  Not all people, just some think of it as a way to combat the boredom that they feel.  When they get tired of their partner making a mess, they think divorce is going to make things better.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	Big time.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Not a sign of weakness how,ever it is a sign of failure . It takes a strong person to see that life they are in, for what it is! After its all said and done ,the strength lye's in the heart and the rose colored glasses come off!|`|ruczpWrGaa	It all depends on the reasoning for divorce.  My ex husband, yes im divorced, was the biggest jerk ever.  and i don't mean we just argued a lot, i mean i was in constant fear of physical violence.  I wasn't allowed to have friends who weren't his friends already.  Im not talking about guys, i mean everyone.  I wasn't even allowed to talk to my family oh the phone without him present.  It wasn't weakness that made me leave, it actually took a lot of strength to leave.  I was brought up to believe that divorce is wrong.  But even my parents were happy when i left him.  He is now on his second divorce.  I on the other hand, i finished school, i have my own house, and i am in a loving relationship.   Last i knew, he didn't have any of that.      On the flip side, divorcing just because your bored or its too hard can be a sign of weakness.  Marriage does take work.  Every situation is different.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Certainly not. Marriage takes full commitment of two people and one may be trying very hard while the other has lost interest. I do not see that it would be fair to consider it a weakness.|`|YDBpaNPzaa	It as to do more with a person willingness to make a marriage work, depending on what the Martial problems are. In other words, let's say there is spousal abuse occurring in the marriage and the abused spouse chooses to end the marriage how on earth could this person be weak!! Or, let's say one spouse finds out the other spouse is hurting a child or something, this spouse is not weak for seeking divorce. Or, there might be a situation of one spouse wants a divorce because the other spouse only cleans the house 4 times a week and the other spouse believes it should be 5 times a week. Well, do you believe that is strong person or a weak person or maybe just unwilling to make a marriage work in a fair and balanced way.|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	No it's not a sign of weakness. It just means that a relationship has come to an end so that the people involved can move forward. And divorce doesn't mean that you have failed either. So don't put yourself down. Learn from what happened and start a new life.|`|IMrer0csaa	It's a sign of bad judgement|`|ohpedSQUaa	I don't think so.  If you enter into a marriage with someone and they turn out to be completely not what you thought you were marrying then divorce is an option.  Marriage isn't easy and it is always changing.  It has its ups and downs.  Just need to wait and see if another up is coming soon.  If no ups come then get out.|`|0SJTOgi6aa	Absolutely not!  It takes a lot of courage to get out of a situation that isn't working.  I think it's weak when people stay in bad marriages and waste their life away with someone they no longer love, who who have cheated on them, or whatever the reason.

I'm sure if they your true friends, they will defiantly want to help you through this.|`|9ImX52QQaa	I know the feeling. What do you like to do? try that. Truthfully those I'm well balanced with my activities, I enjoy myself playing video games, to get away from reality. Just try doing something to get your mind off it.

Thats the best I can give you.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	make over, change your hair color or do something new it always helps go shopping if you have any money, also have fun and listen to upbeat music THAT DOESTN REMIND YOU OF HIM!!;)|`|9hPnvmuzaa	It's only natural that you get used to have someone around and once they're gone, you're left alone.  So what you need to do now is busy yourself. And for future relationships, always set aside "me time" and not dedicate every second of your life to your relationship. I'm not saying to not give a guy all your love but don't give them all of you (if that makes sense). And keep your friends and continue to hang out with them because you need them as much as they need you.     Hope this helped!|`|4tDTQOgNaa	One thing that helped me is thinking about all the negativity that the guy put you through or had to experience. That's what really got me through.|`|l5OMFTMUaa	you will find someone else, dont worry, i would say try to occupy your time as much as you can. think of how much worse life with a loser would be... ugh, no fun! you dont want to be one of those girls that stays with a guy just to not be alone... its so not worth it, you did the right thing!! :) congrats|`|ark4Psqjaa	i have a idea why don't you get drunk alcohol helps so dose time heals all the wounds|`|OYzPApodaa	Get on with your life  flirt and be good at it  get to some of those projects that you didn't have time for due to boyfriend  Clean yourself up nice and head out for a night with the girls  Have a heart to heart with Mom or other female equivalent    Glad to hear your happy  so shine!!|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	your friends can always cheer you up. or go walking. walking always changes your mind because of the amount of functions your brain has to do to keep you moving and steady. i'ts always helped me|`|G3Q21MDCaa	I just got some good advice on this subject.  Try to find something good that you can take from your relationship.  Whether that is something you learned about yourself or something that you learned that you don't want in a partner.  Use that info to grow as a person.  Also, keep busy, do something fun that you haven't done in awhile.  Go somewhere new, meet new people, get back into the swing of things.  Good luck.|`|U3DK6ngEaa	GOD! I feel you! I dated a complete moron for like a month and one night he was like "I LOVE YOU!!" and drunk. AFTER ONE MONTH!! So I ended it that night.     He sent me flowers 5, FIVE, days in a row to work. I felt bad but I knew I couldn't keep dating him. I thanked him for the flowers the first two days, after that I had to kindly ask him to stop. After the fifth day I was like Stocker!!!    Breakups hurt but it's good they happen. It makes people stronger in the end. Plus, if you hadn't broken up with him he may never have found his true (maybe idiot too lol!) love. You did him a favor.    If it isn't right, don't waste anymore of yours or his time... move on! Your true love is out there waiting on you!! Awww! hehe!|`|4bMMC47Baa	Maybe you miss him n u want to go back with him n whats the reason you broke up with him?|`|ZWN3JJ4Iaa	spend time with friends! take up a hobby and spend more time with family.|`|3JMEzpC5aa	Just try to move on and find someone better for you.  Next time get to know the person better and see them for who they really are, and dont settle for someone that treats you like crap.|`|Lnwi0ULuaa	well you obviously still care for him/her, or you wouldn't be asking this question. takes time. that's the only thing thats going to help. occupy your mind with other things, friends, family. just go out and have fun.
oUDDsVu5aa	My first reaction would be to ask her why she did that and depending on the response she gave me to the question is what would dictate what I would do next.If she responded with something negative towards me I would clear the air with her about it and if she responded with something like a crush on me and that is what this sounds like I would let her know that I would never do that to my friend and to stop it and then I would make sure I never let any opportunity at any point for her and I to be alone with out my friend being there so that she never has a chance to make a move on me and I would avoid them both as much as possible with out causing suspension to give her time to realize that it is wrong for her to do what she is doing and give it time to wear off  But no matter how you slice it it would be a awkward situation and very uncomfortable|`|5gqc5qyzaa	I wouldn't do anything. I'd just find her odd.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	she loves you still mate ...|`|WXVZ9OFyaa	I would not do anything different. I would speak as usual and carry on.|`|7mLvb0rNaa	she might just be cool about past relationship, no worries unless they start hanging out alone together.|`|9ZTADEzTaa	I would kiss her passionately and have sex with her in front of everyone|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Kick her in the vagina.
QIQNzE11aa	I don't snore, but my husband does at times. He only does if he's exhausted or sick. Though, once in a blue moon it starts for no reason. I generally try to make him roll over, that helps. But i also bought a sound machine to use all the time. We have a neighbor who leaves their dog out all night and the thing seems happy to bark for 2 hours straight. So, the sound machine cuts the dog out and helps cut out my husbands snoring to a degree. When he's exhausted, nothing else much helps. I spend a frustrated night tyring to sleep when i can. At times, i go to the spare room and sleep there.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	uggh my husband does, very very loudly too. I usually plug his nose when it starts getting annoying hah|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I only snore when I'm extremely tired or sick, so I've been told. My husband loses sleep just like I do when he snores or I move to another bed.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	He snores and I`m sleepy right now..I feel like I was with two orangutans fighting last night!...|`|gYyW39wTaa	no|`|b26NgqOFaa	LOL  I don't snore but when I was pregnant I used to make this puff-puffing sound when I slept. He used to nudge me and wake me up. It pissed me off.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	my husband does.  if it wakes me up i usually go sleep on the couch or make him go sleep on the couch.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	I don't, unless I'm getting sick, but my husband does every night!!!  He sounds like a freight train and my dog, on the other side of me, snores just as loudly!|`|dtHjJah5aa	Only when exhausted or sick.  He laughs at me because he snores like a freight train and I make him take snoring medicine for it.  He snores so loud that it will wake me out of a dead sleep and I think, "should I put the pillow over his face or just go sleep in the recliner".  When he wakes up in the morning and comes to find me in the recliner he thanks me for letting him live another day.  LOL!|`|AA11328507	My dude snores and it drives me crazy!  I can't stand to be woken by his snores and to see him out sound asleep and I am suffering.  I do not want to leave my bed and feel he should DO something about his snoring.    We are in the process of moving to the attic in my house for more space and our own bathroom.  We will also have a room that I was going to make into a living room; HE will be sleeping there for the most part.    When he gets into it, I will either plug his nose, push his head to the side, pull on his pillow or just push his shoulder.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	I snore, and my hubby sleeps right thru it.|`|IXskJPlVaa	A lot and quite loud at that. We are married 27 years and she has never complained just tells me that I snore. Also is concerned if it will have any ill effects - though I try to convince her not to worry still she has her concerns. She is the best wife one can get - LUCKY ME.|`|LmicIEOxaa	I don't snore. My girlfriend used to. When she used to snore, at first I thought it was funny. But when I mentioned it to her, she was embarassed. I think women get more embarrassed than men about their snoring. She used a tennis ball trick to stop her snoring. Put a tennis ball in a sock and pin it to the back of your shirt. Most people snore when they sleep on thier back. The tennis ball makes you roll over onto your side if you roll over on your back during the night.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	nopess|`|UONwTWIQaa	my fiance snores.. it drives me bonkers..i used to wake him up constantly, or go sleep on the couch.. it was awful.. then, i started using ear plugs and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! its been great nights sleep since, and i can stay in bed with him!|`|ohpedSQUaa	Yes I have been told that I snore.  My husband just pokes fun at me and I tell him he is lying! ha ha ha, cause I don't snore.|`|qEwOcoycaa	I don't snore whenever i sleep.  if i have boyfriend that snore i would feel disgusted by his snoring especially of he snores loud  i really don't like people that snore it is just so annoying especially when you are trying so hard to get some sleep .
0gOWh0z2aa	Mix it up.  Lean forward with your hands on the bed and let your breasts dangle and rub against his chest.  Sit up straight and go straight up and down and touch your breasts for him and let him watch.|`|PEbFQtL6aa	There are technically only two positions..... up and down.
ecNeN0staa	He's pathetic.  If his life meant anything to him, he'd stop using and abusing his family.  I'm sorry that you had to go through this and wish you the best.|`|AA11185479	No one can tell you what to do in this case, and there is no right or wrong answer.  You have to decide for yourself what it best for you.    Your father is a drug addict, and that isn't going to change.  You will never be able to rely on him to stay clean - he might finally clean up and stay straight someday, but you will never have any way of knowing for sure how long he will stay that way.  You need to accept that fundamental fact.  Once you realize that he will always be unreliable, you need to re-assess your relationship.  Knowing that fact, can you still have a relationship with him?  Can you be friends with someone you only trust in little things, not in the big things?  Can you live with these limitations?  It's up to you.  Maybe you're not ready or capable of doing that at this age, but you'll be able to later in life.  You are the only person who knows what you need.    If you decide not to talk to him, at least inform him of your decision and your reasons. (A letter would work great).  Tell him you're not ready to trust someone who has hurt you so much in the past, but you will contact him when you are ready.  Make sure to get a phone number or way to reach him.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	I feel a great deal of empathy for you and for your father.  Your story tells me that he really does want to have a good relationship with you.  When he is making the effort to remain clean, you two do great together and that is a hopeful thing.  Drug addiction is a really ugly thing that hurts not only the addict but everyone else around them.  Are you corresponding with your father while he is in prison?  If so, tell him the same things you are telling us here.  He needs to hear that you are very hurt by his using and him being in prison.  A couple things here bear mentioning.  Your father is not trying to hurt you.  That is the furthest thing from his mind.  Addiction (especially to needle drugs) is a very difficult thing to kick, and he needs help to stay clean.  You can not be that help.  He needs treatment and/or community support involvement, such as Narcotics Anonymous to help him stay clean.  People will think that being in prison for years should be enough to keep someone clean.  It isn't.  Even is he stayed completely clean in there (and drugs ARE available), the addiction itself and the mindset for using are still intact.  If he convinces himself just once when he gets out that he is strong enough to be around it, he's lost again.  While he is in prison, I recommend you talk with your mother about attending some Alateen or Narateen meetings in or near your community.  That's a support group for teenagers with an alcoholic or addict parent.  This will give you the support you need and some direction for handling this within yourself.  Forgiveness is great, but you do that for you, not to keep your father clean.  Best wishes to you!|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	you should send him letters and tell him that you dont know how things are so good and all of suddent there all wrong...ask him to change...to change for you.  and i really hope everything goes good!!  :)

If you want her to stop having sex, treat her like property, an idiot, a child, or otherwise not an equal human being that you love thoroughly.  If you don't want her to stop having sex, don't do that.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Because his job has him out of the country...|`|gYyW39wTaa	the sex is still hot|`|W1rCsvTzaa	There are generally two types of women out there.  Those who think it is "their body" full stop and those who think that marriage means you are sharing "everything".  My wife understands that we share everything with each other including our bodies.  Here is what this means:  1. We both committed to being faithful and have been for 20 years.  No cheating of any type.  Emotional, physical etc.  No head games trying to make the other jealous.    2. We both committed to staying fit.  And we both are.  I said early on, we are sharing bodies, big fat bodies are a turn off.  Lets not go there.  We haven't.    3. We compromise on frquency of sex and connect twice a week on average.  She does not want it as often as I do.  We meet in the middle on frequency but she NEVER makes me compromise on quality.  She ROCKS MY WORLD in bed.      We talked about most of this before we got married.  Be careful who you marry.  Some women do not understand how important sex is to a man and they act like "something girl" who posted that most of her pregnancy she "didn't feel like it".  Let me tell you something, if every time I didn't "feel like working" I slept in, we would be broke instead of living in a nice house in a great school district with zero debt of any kind including mortgage.      Ask lots of questions.  If you don't like the answers ask more questions.  Don't marry someone who isn't going to care about your needs or you will be miserable.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	we haven't slowed down. It's getting better!|`|lxSRIFK2aa	he got fat|`|THJCWCoMaa	I never went that long in my marriage without sex. I do know a weird guy who cut off his wife when he THOUGHT she was cheating on him.

Then he cheated and I took a looooooong break from it. His fault!    All women are different. We are not all the same. Some want it always and forever, some only make u believe they are sex freaks just to reel u in. Once they got u, u marry them, the sex does stop. U just better hope u REALLY know the one u marry!|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	I cant even imagine waiting that long. My husband and I even after 20 years enjoy sex. In fact it's better with age. We know what each other likes and aren't shy with each other anymore. Now that I've Hit my Peak I like it three times a day. The longest we've gone is two weeks due to stress or travel. I think you need to find someone who like the physical contact as much as you do.|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	he didn't help do ANYTHING around the house.  then he would pester me for hours by grabbing my crotch for sex.  We have 5 kids, so obviously there is a lot to do.  by the time i was done doing all of it myself, i was a little resentful and tired.  plus, never had time to take care of myself and feel sexy and look sexy, so it was hard to get in the mood.  so anyway, then i would just give in after he would pressure me enough to get it over with, and then he'd immediately complain that this or that wasn't done.  Now how on earth was i supposed to get stuff done when i was having naughty time with him?  My other issue years ago was porn.  He was constantly looking at it instead of helping me, and lie about it to boot.  Wouldn't come to bed, but was on the internet scouring for porn.  It's hard to want to be with someone when you feel like you have to compete.  I don't necessarily feel that way about porn anymore, but things are a little different now, compared to years ago.  I figured why do what he can do on his own, he didn't need me.  IDK, it just used to be more of a chore.  luckily some of that has changed and i enjoy sex with him again...but it took a long time.    EDIT:  and MEM is right.  It isn't easy to have some conversations, but it's better to know you are on the same page about EVERTHING before you get married, then to find out afterwards how miserable you might be.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Marriage is what you make it - BOTH of you.  Ok so its aisle altar hymn but many women see it as 'i'll alter him'.  Unfortunately, many women see it - within a few years time - that now that they have their man they don't need to bother anymore - and this can be vice versa also.    You have to keep the sparkle going, be spontaneous, I think a lot of the time things seem to change when children come along - the wife can be tired most the time and at the end of the day she just wants to fall into bed to sleep, rather than have sex!    So if thats the case, make sure the baby can stay with grandparents once a week at least and make sure you don't starve yourselves of 'couple time'.      Make sure you regularly 'treat' your wife and remind her how special she is and how much you love her.  Every now and then book the two of you into a hotel for the night, and don't let all the fun things and the romantic things you do before you are married stop when you get married.  Even if money is tight it doesn't mean you can't still enjoy life and each other!      I truly believe that if you dont stop appreciating your wife then you should always have a healthy sex life!  Women need to feel special and loved - its the little things even just an out of the blue tex to say I love you - can mean the world to a wife!    And the wife must give you a written agreement also that she won't nag!! haha.  Remember - Good relationships are made they dont just happen.|`|Bo49sEX2aa	Why don't you ask your wife?

My current hubby? Never have. All I can say is if it happens, examine the entire marriage and try to determine what the cause is....do NOT ignore it...always ask why....the answer might surprise you.    Also, pregnancy, childbirth, the adjustment period to having a baby, stress, stuff at work, hidden medical issues/illness and prescription meds can cause it.....so can issues within the marriage. There is no pat formula for prevention as each situation is unique which is why I say examine the overall pix and ask why.....good luck.|`|dprURFLxaa	I never have...it just gets WAY better every time and we do it a LOT.
fzWuDeCsaa	I have to say I was in a very similar situation not to long ago, I was asking her to go out with me like you day after day and that is a big NO. Do not I repeat do not do that. You will pressure her and that could end up with her not talking to you anymore. So once you asked she now knows you want to so just be a good friend and if all goes well she will tell you she wants to and you can be dating her in know time.|`|LGPOESonaa	well it just depends really.  being a girl, we do that sometimes when we are unsure of what we want.  but we just want space and for people to quit asking.  we are thinking of a way to let you know what we want!|`|mymTKvJraa	no. she doesnt want to get into the realationship if it's going to end badly.  Be prepared for the worst!!|`|WAHNf3bAaa	I had similar trouble with a girl, but she full on didn't give an answer, so eventually I just moved on then she said she liked me and it was just like, well done, a bit late now. I'd say just don't let her think your off her but don't give her all the attention she's craving and see what happens.|`|BUvPi5ldaa	I think she is playing hard to get,  or just quite shy and doesnt know   how to act around you.  =) Keep trying.|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	you can't change someone's opinion of you easily. if she's thinking give her a little space|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	tell her that your not going to wait around forever for an answer. she needs to know that you have alot of feelings for her but you also need to figure out how she feels about you. i dont think shes playing hard to get, the girl just doesnt know what she wants.|`|7a7a3Wbmaa	shes playing hard to get. she does like you but wants you to wait. dont talk to her unless she talks to her first she her 2 can play at this game|`|AA10467924	Okay...if she liked you back, she would have said "yes," but obviously she is just playing games. Being a girl, we are told to make him chase, but sometimes...girls don't know when to stop and give a little more feedback. Okay, waiting and thinking about it a few days is okay I guess, but after a couple days if she hasn't given you an answer yet, then you need to realize that she's just not that into you and you need to move on. You will find someone else to like, someone maybe even better than her. You didn't do anything wrong.|`|3lRX0tHkaa	She might just be playing hard to get, or she may not like you and not want to hurt your feelings. If she's playing hard to get, she may not want to seem to desperate. So sometimes if you don't talk to her for a day or just answer "sure" or "yeah" or "ok" to when she talks to you, she might want you even more. So maybe YOU should be the one playing hard to get.|`|Lnwi0ULuaa	play a better game bud. bench her. make her the water boy.
bhRuOeBpaa	Regardless of anything else, an 18 year old having sex with a 13 year old is statutory rape and a felony.  Unless you get a rape kit done quickly though it may be hard to prove.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, thats rape. Tell him he needs to hide out from the law, they'll be on the lookout for him. 18 is an adult. 13 is still underage minor. It doesn't matter if you said it was okay, it will still be rape.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If he got you drunk and had sex with you and you didn't know what you were doing - that's rape. And the fact that you are 13, it's rape anyway, even if you did know what you were doing. He deserves to be in jail.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes he did.|`|w5PXLYvkaa	what r u thinking. u jus ruined ur life. now ur gonna tell the person u love that u had sex at 1 when u were drunk............woww|`|4293T0LNaa	yes, thats statutory rape, ur a minor! he shouldnt have given u beer and then had sex with u, it was rape!!|`|HfTbzv32aa	yup. yup. yup. it dont matter if the was beer or not|`|JCdBSULraa	Yes, this is rape by every definition.|`|eFwiRCcdaa	duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh big turd turn him in|`|g2XbXYyraa	>Im 13 and hes 18 I dont know if i got raped but we were fooling around?  >13 and hes 18 I dont know if i got raped  >13 and hes 18; i got raped    Yes you did.  Enjoy your AIDS.  It would suck to be alive for you right now.|`|Aa6IV2U9aa	by the law. yes.  he did rape you.    but i am a firm believer in the idea that what a person thinks should be what matters.. so. if you feel violated then more than likely you need to tell someone.  and if not.. then you should talk about it with some one. i was in the same spot and i found that the longer i kept it in the more i was beginning to feel worse and worse..|`|LGHMmRVFaa	well first of all you are stupid to be fooling around with an 18 year old second you are stupid to take a beer from him and third of all you are stupid for running away!!!  report him if you think he druged you which i bet he did and GO HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   back to your parents they love you and they miss you so just go home and report him    STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|EHapSQFDaa	if u didnt want to have sex with him then yes he raped you but because he is consider and adult n ur consider a child it will be consider rape regardless if u wanted to or not|`|Dhh7eE1maa	yea u got raped|`|l60zgb1iaa	That wasn't such a good idea but i'm sure that you probably have heard that a million times by now....Had that been me I would go to the doctors, and see if there was forced entry or if anything looks like it shouldn't. Plus you should really go get tested for any and everything, due to you being drunk or whatever you cant be sure he used protection. I really wish you the best and i hope that you make better decisions in the future|`|qJCkyj1Qaa	maybe or not he didn't make you drink the beer,So its 50/50.|`|LHe1Algaaa	Yes, because you were drunk. Yes, because of his and your ages. Sorry sweetie, I hope you're okay.
ZfleGhXLaa	Maggie gowns will be $700 and up, the more heavily detailed ones will be well over $1,000.  The "Mariah" style will likely run from a little under $1,000, to a bit over.  If you see it for anywhere waaay less than that, it is a replica dress.  These knock-offs use no real pattern, and unless you have actually seen pictures of the dress-makers work doing this particular work, you have no idea how your dress will turn out (usually the sites selling knock offs will use the designers picture and not show any photos of their actual work)    Here are some of the lower priced places online where you can get a genuine Maggie:    http://www.bestbridalprices.com/maggie-s...    http://www.thebridalshop.com/maggiesotte...    http://www.jaysbridal.net/store/Maggie-S...    http://www.jaysbridal.net/store/Maggie-S... (You need to log in to see the price here, but it's much lower than any of the other places, or than you'll likely see anywhere)|`|76nTvO4iaa	Mariah isn't listed on this site, but it might give you an idea of the MSRP on the dresses in general:    http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-...|`|4POGapREaa	I was looking at her dresses before I got married & there's a shop by me that carries them.  They were mostly around $800-$1000.  I was looking for more of a sheath style, nothing poofy with huge amounts of fabric, so my range was around $800.  Hope that helps.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	the one i love... "charley" is about $760-850 at different stores. there is this website www.topbridaldresses.com that makes REPLICAS. i'm thinking about getting a replica od the "charley" dress for $329 but i'm not sure how alike it will be to the original|`|4lL34wJnaa	My dress is the Jessica.  I paid $1069, but I had issues when I went to go order it back in September.    It was a dress I tried on toward the middle of my looking and I had already made appointments at other bridal shops, so I wanted to keep looking before making my decision.  I came back to the shop 2 weeks after I had initially tried it on and the price went up $200 dollars.  I remarked at the seemingly drastic increase ( I was already blowing my budget of $1000 for the perfect dress I decided I could pay a little more, but $200 was too much) and because the bridal shop had me on file from 2 weeks before, they were able to sell me the dress for the original price.  I guess because our economy stinks, everything that is made overseas has gone up in price.  The owner of that bridal shop told me that Maggie Sottero now charges $50 just for the box to ship the dress in!  That doesn't include the actual shipping!      I am now anxiously awaiting my dress to come in and I can't wait!|`|zaSyEcnqaa	$900-$1700  check www.bestbridalprices.com|`|4SjwTCASaa	My Maggie Sottero was about $1,400. After looking at Mariah, I would guess it would be somewhere right around $2,000.    EDIT:  Also, I don't know where you live, but we don't have sales tax where I live, so I found the dress in Oklahoma so I could try it on, then waited until I got home and ordered it from a local shop (saved me a bunch of money on sales tax and shipping and the dress was cheaper), so definitely shop around.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Expect anywhere from $800-$6000 possibly more. It really depends on the shop you get it from and how greedy they are in making profit. For a great example. A lady that owns a bridal shop in my town was watching "Say Yes to the Dress". On that show they were selling a gown for $7000 that was a Maggie and the shop owner had the exact same gown in her shop for sale for $1200. Just goes to show you they don't have to charge that much, they just do because they are greedy and know they can make big profit. So pick out the gown you like and then carefully shop around. Don't settle with the first person who has it. Good luck! Have a great wedding, Maggie gowns are so gorgeous! Also the dress shop owner as mentioned above told me that Maggie gowns have been steadily going up about 20% each year. So shop wisely and timely.|`|8cO6c0Usaa	Maggie Sottero dresses vary in price from 750-1600 dollars. They have a few "special edittion dresses" that they sell at wedding shows for about $2000.00, but those are only at wedding shows and trunk shows, you won't find those at bridal boutiques.  The most you will ever spend on a Maggie Sottero is $1600.00, unless you need alterations.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	I guess it depends on the shop but the one I fell in love with is called brea and it runs $679 at a little shop by my house.  You can go on maggiesottero.com and find places in your area that sell them. Good luck!|`|uTdEdpAeaa	they start anywhere from 700 and up.
GAjQHpg8aa	Tell them to get more sleep or something, it's not very nice of them to respond that way when you offer them your hospitality.    Maybe shock them with some extreme dares or something?|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	well, i think you should plan to do stuff so when they came you have many ideas.. some ideas i think would be this;  gossip about guys for a while, play monopoly or watch a movie with popcorn and bring them soda and chips ..and it should be a comedy movie so you guys cann all laugh together..and you guys should talk a little bout funny embarrassing times..lol..and you can actually show them some pictures when you were small..lol!|`|JeSMTwbfaa	Ask them what they would enjoy doing. If they say they don't care, or nothing, they try and pick something they might like, or that you like. It may just take a little bit of time for your friends to feel comfortable at your house.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	Put it this way if you were going to a friend's house and you were bored what would you suggest.|`|fM5TrioGaa	;before you invite ene' of ur freinds over you should think about whatchu gunna do, if not then what's d pointt.
oGoWz511aa	I think most of the time it's because they don't want to believe anyone could dump them.  Even when they are the ones who asked for, or are guilty of the actions that caused the break up.  I also think jealousy can play a big role in it.  Even if they were unhappy with the relationship.  They can't stand to think someone else might be happy with their ex, or they just can't stand to see their ex happy.  Of course, there are always a few who actually loved an ex.  They just need some time to get over it.  The problem is, they often start dating new people in an attempt to do that.  Then, the problem becomes a problem for the people they date.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's human nature to want things you can't have or things you shouldn't have that's where discipline comes in combined with wisdom. Don't waste time with losers if you do then you lose.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Here's what I say about this question. There's a girl I met, dated for several months, but she had bad breath and she was great in bed for intercourse action, but I just couldn't get over her bad breath...it's horrible Hygiene, it may be almost puke.    A couple of months later I meet her at the Harvey's Grocery store and she say's she is not doing anything tonight. She moved to another apartment and has a dog now and invites me over.    So crazy me, I go over to her apartment and after a few drinks put up with the bad breath and get that lovely sex action one more time. I never seen her again after that. Ex? Stay Ex I say!|`|OBCvewW2aa	It makes sense to people who don't vilify an ex just because the relationship didn't work out.  As the wise Carrie Bradshaw said, as we get older we're not dating wildly inappropriate people anymore.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	what?|`|R4F05z4Faa	you need some bed rest.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I'm not sure unless it's the other part of them they haven't gotten over yet. Usually one doesn't fall in love or get with someone if they know their bad, that usually comes after they're together. People that love or have loved someone want to hold on to the good that drew them to them in the first place and even after it's over, they still believe that part of them is still there and they can't let go completely because of it.|`|tYvPVAbOaa	Some people just like the fact that they can still get with that person if they want to,. But there are hundreds of reasons,.|`|pma90Xycaa	When you're away from someone, you start to think about all their wonderful qualities.  You can sit and rationalize that "Joe wasn't such a bad guy.  Sure he used to look at other girls and flirt with them in front of my face, but he was funny.  Maybe I was just overreacting!"  *grin*  Sometimes it's done because you're lonely and other times it's because the heart wants to forget the pain.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Unresolved emotions.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Some people just don't know when to walk away.  They like the drama or something.  I have never wanted to go back to an ex myself.  I don't live my life in reverse!|`|Bo49sEX2aa	Because you don't want to go forward, that is why you are attracted to your ex.    Holding on to an ex, especially if you are with someone new, means you don't want to really be in a relationship so you blame it on "being atrracted to your ex" as the demise of your current relationship.  If you are single and going back to the ex, it means you are not wanting to be emotionaly available for the next person, It is always easy to go back for sex, company, whatever.   But remember, it ended for a reason.  Be healthy and move on.|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	its just usually they had great sex together,,thats it..nothing else compatibale outside the bedroom,,and somehow they still want that great sex,,think the insanity will not be there..and things will change this time..  and the definition of insanity here, is doing something over and over again expecting different results. but getting burned everytime..insanity..|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	No way would I go back to an ex husband , now bf ...we'll see......|`|yy45iAbtaa	only the insecure people want to get back with there ex because they are the only ones that will put up with the bull ****.|`|e7dAJAA6aa	Some people are just self destructive.

ALQuQaLGaa	I think that by virtue of being married to a native New Zealander, you are entitled to be a resident of New Zealand.  I would check with the local immigration authorities.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	If you marry him you can get some sort of green card type thing, and eventually become a citizen.    I think.    Maybe go talk to someone who knows about that sort of thing. Lawyer maybe?|`|u1uECuFNaa	If he is a citizen, you can go with him if you are married.   Just make sure to get a passport and all.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	No, there is nothing wrong with you, you just get turned on really easily. Sometimes it passes with age and sometimes it last a life time lol. I've been like that since I can remember and love it. I say enjoy it.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Lower male nudity?    I don't think there's anything wrong with you.  It will diminish over time as you add mental baggage to your life.  Things like guys not doing dishes or taking out the trash or vacuuming often enough will turn you off.  Raising kids will as well.
0xv2GecJaa	She has nothing to stand on but she can sue for anything she wants just as anyone can.|`|otTslvAOaa	nope.... once a child is 18.... I don't think that you have to support... the child is on his or her own.    however, it might be different where you are...... talk to your lawyer.|`|k73IxCHaaa	She does have the right, whether she'll win or not is a different matter. In most states a child is emancipated at the age of 21.|`|j7l9gavRaa	nope 18 is the cutoff for support, it might depend on the state you live in though|`|ljwJr6u8aa	if the child is in school, most likely she can. I think that maybe a question for a lawyer,because every state is a little different.If the agreement was in writing then it may stand up in court,but if it was verbal then most likely you are screwed. I know if you get SSI the government keeps paying until the child is through school. and that includes college.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	This happened to me in Indiana.  I thought 18 was the cut off date for support but I learned that if..IF my non custodial child elected to go to college then I was bound to help educate her for a baccalaurate degree.  So there you go.......I think your ex will meet with defeat if you can prove you are paying 80%    Also Indiana says that I am obligaged for costs at State Schools.  If she chose a private college then I would pay the state amount and she would be obligated for the balance.|`|96zZlJVYaa	only if he attend college that is only for another 4 yrs max! and you're done paying child support. at 80% is more than enough to paid.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Yes, especially if the child is in school. It could go on till the child is 25.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	Unfortunately, I believe that, as long as they are in school, I think up to 24, you would have to continue to pay child support. I'm not sure the laws in your area, but that might only apply if you child is living at home... we get the shaft in this area... :(|`|yy45iAbtaa	she can take you to court whenever she  wants to does not mean she will get it.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	There is no way can she get you for more|`|dtHjJah5aa	No.  After a minor reaches 18 they are considered an adult.  Therefore, she can not take him back to court on behalf of the 18 year old.  Good luck.|`|R4F05z4Faa	don't worry , she can't do like this.
0Rr3PFMyaa	humm, maybe he liked u more than a friend and he found out that you dont like him that way. I would say that he is just annoyed but if u guys have been friends for that long its kinda weird. Send him an e-mail asking him what is wrong, maybe that will help. Apologize and tell him that u really want to know what is bothering him so u can change it.    ya I also agree that if he is a real friend he will come around and start talking to you again.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Maybe he found out some shady stuff you did concerning him behind his back, or he's probably just tired of you and your mood swings, maybe you treat him like crap and hes tired.    Friends don't like to argue. Friend's shouldn't go off on eachother. Friend's don't go anywhere if they really care.
AA10874773	they have invitaions for that - reconfirming your wedding vows.  congrats!|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.    It's called a Renewal of Vows ceremony.    If you want it in a church, then speak with the pastor, minister, priest as to what is allowed.    Personally, I think a wedding dress and a wedding party is over-the-top.....but that's just my opinion.    Invitations would be worded something like:    Please join us for a celebration of our marriage  as we renew our vows   [date]  [time]  [place]    Etc., etc.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You never said your vows so how can you be married ? This I dont understand but you can certainly have a marriage blessing or a renewal of vows ceremony and wear a wedding dress of your choice.  I would invite guests by saying Mr & Mrs...............request the pleasure of the company of .....................at the blessing of our marriage/renewal of vows ceremony (which ever it is) on .........................and here you put the venue, the time and the date.  You cant get married twice and assuming you have already got a marriage certificate then you are legally married.  Good luck.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You don't. You are already married so you don't get a second wedding to the same person. Life does not offer do-overs just because you couldn't wait to have a wedding with your family and friends in attendance.     What you are planning is *not* a wedding no matter what you believe otherwise. It is a called a renewal of vows. You had to say your vows at the civil ceremony in order for it to be legal, so you are being delusional if you think you haven't already said them. Sorry for being harsh but it is reality.    Wearing a wedding dress and making it look like an actual wedding is considered improper and it is too late now to do that.since you had a chance to do that the first time and you chose not to. You made your bed so now you have to lie in it.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	"reception" is still the correct term for the party you are planning.    try something like:    Jane Roe and John Doe were married on September 1, 2008 in a private ceremony in Las Vegas, Nevada.  you are cordially invited to celebrate their marriage at a special reception held for family and friends on July 4, 2009 etc etc etc.    if you want to say your vows in a church then you invite them to a vow renewal followed by a reception.  and you'd word it in a similar manner to the way I suggested the reception invitation.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Why not have a Celebration to Honor your Marriage... I would word the Invitation like this: "Better Late than Never" ~ Please join Mr. & Mrs. Smith, as they Honor their union in Marriage (last fall), by proclaiming their Vows with Family & Friends in this outlandishly Fun Black Tie event!      This way, those who thought you had a reception & just were not invited, will see that with humor, you are wanting get everyone together to celebrate with you.  As far as having someone officiate the vows, you can have anyone stand in or a minister, doesn't matter. If you haven't watched the remake movie, "Guess Who?" - I would advise you to do so... the end is fantastic!|`|AA11312653	I have nothing against vow renewal. It is absolutely lovely for a couple to reaffirm their commitment to each other and I enjoy parties, so what is to not like? I'm glad I asked.    What is to not like is a pretend wedding. Unless there is actually a marriage taking place, it is not a wedding and should not have the trimmings of a wedding such as Wedding Gown and matching bridesmaids. By all means have a live band, fancy cake, oceans of champagne, hired limo, and catered meal. Buy a fabuloous new dress that will make you the envy of every woman present. White evening gown, yes -- wedding gown, no.     Repeating your vows in the presence of those you care about is a great idea, but I urge you to try to make this a surprise for your guests. You want to avoid anything that would inspire your prospective guests to say "Do we have to get them a present?"     If the vows and the party are in the same location, wording the invitations won't be a problem.     David Dunn and Rose Redd  request the honour of the presence of  [write in up to 2 names]  for a special service   at Two O'Clock   on Saturday April First,   First Unitarian Church  567 NW 89 Avenue  Townsville.    To be followed by a reception.     Any kind of party can be called a reception, since the host is receiveing guests. If you prefer you can put "To be followed by a dinner and dance" or a tea or a pig roast or whatever.  You use the "honour of your presence" if you ask people to a church service since it is God's House, not your house, so you can't actually issue invitations unless you authorized to speak for God. If you invite people to a hall or someones home, change that phrase to "the pleasure of your company."    If the reaffirmation ceremony and party are not at the same location, then you need either more lines on the invitation or an enclosed reception card for     To be followed by a reception  at Harrison's Chop House  22 Main Street, Townsville.     Best wishes for a wonderful good time and a long, happy marriage.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	It would still be considered a renewal of vows because the marriage certificate if already signed and officially you are now Mr and Mrs whatever your husbands name is unless you kept your maiden name|`|wvhoS7WDaa	basicly you are married but you may want to say.    come join us for a public ceremony or be a witness of the union of us  if you have not had a bachelorette party yet why not plan one check out  http://www.bacheloretteplanners.com|`|ztzEloj5aa	Send out wedding announcements.

The civil service seals more of the "legality" that goes with getting married,  while a church ceremony, usually is more on the "ceremonial, traditional, and religious" aspect of it.    best wishes!     Holy Matrimony  for christians... that's probably why they "they take it to the church" ....just a wild guess ;-)|`|VpCtXEMGaa	Call it a nuptials celebration. Your having a party to celebrate your wedding. have fun planning!|`|qxpbdVAJaa	it seems you asked this question twice, and i answered the other post...after reading the answers here i just wanted to pipe in here that, in my humble opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a formal ceremony following the civil one that legally married you.    neither i, nor anyone else here, knows why you did not have a formal wedding in the first place - and we don't need to.  as long as the attendees of your reception/party/wedding/ are made aware that this is not the occasion which will actually wed you and your husband in the legal sense, then you can do no wrong.  have whatever kind of event YOU want to celebrate YOUR wedding.  it is not a "fake" wedding if the love and commitment are there, so have at it.  if you wish to wear a wedding gown, and have all the "trimmings" of a wedding, then you should have it.    i just found the snobbery on here obnoxious and wanted to encourage you to do this if you wish...if you don't, you may regret it later (AS MAY YOUR LOVED ONES WHO PROBABLY WANT VERY MUCH TO SHARE THIS IMPORTANT STEP IN YOUR LIVES WITH YOU) so do what feels right to you and your husband.    that is all.  ;>
y43tzOQlaa	This is a tough one, 8 yrs. is allot of time. I know from experience that once the computer and the searching starts and you find things that are really not your thing it brings up trust issues. There are lot's of choices out there and it may harmless but he's still looking and denying it. He may feel that in his heart it's wrong so he can't open up to you about it. Once you start feeling like an investigator in your own home it's a slippery sloap, the trust is very hard to maintain. You need to look into counseling, it sounds like an impartial 3rd party could have some good input while listening to both side.   Good luck|`|iEYBCL1Naa	this is too long.
HEzyvbDvaa	It all depends on the person who is seeking..be it male or female.  They can be mentally impaired, insecured or some other medical problem.  Than there are those who bottomly sincere and are tired of going to a bar or wherever one goes to find the love of their live.  I personally enjoy them and met my last mate online and we were together for 6 years. Today we are friends with or w/o the benefits or is that call his booty call as we all are his booty call from here to the carribbean..Always and forever|`|mINKANlAaa	definately dangerous. they could be faking their identity and you would never know..PERVS|`|ark4Psqjaa	waist of time and money|`|EHapSQFDaa	it can work both ways here...yes it can be dangerous because you dont really know who you chatting with and what their intensions are    but then again it can be good...i met my bf online 3 yrs ago and we are happy...you just have to be carefull    never give your personal info and if n when u met always met at a public place|`|vWWwOmDjaa	i internet date and i haven't gotten hurt yet. you have to be careful what information you give out. it's a good tool to meet people who are compitable with you, yes.|`|BUvPi5ldaa	You have to go with a reliable site you know things about from friends / family or from tv ads.
662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	Have you parents cover the expenses for your sister's wedding.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Those are far enough away that I don't see how it would be a problem.  Oct 09 means that it shouldn't effect any of your wedding planning at all as you'll have barely started.    As for the fact that you live 1000 miles a way, and you have a chronic illness, I really don't think your sister is going to be a bridezilla and expect all that much out of you.    I had it completely under control and didn't ask my maids for really anything.  I didn't need their opinion on all this stuff.  I picked my dress, my rehearsal hall, my invites, with really no one else's opinion at all.  I did ask my maid to help with the dress trying on as the things I picked for her looked terrible and she's had way more experience dressing her body than I have.  She went and tried on dresses, took pictures and mailed them to me.  She told me which was her favorite and I agreed.  She ordered hers and I emailed the other bridesmaids to tell them to order theirs.    I don't think she will have extremely high expectations since you live so far away and have a chronic illness.  Your sister knows this.    Look for cheapest flights possible.  Sign up for lists so they will email you if the fair drops.  Many of your trips the weekends will be optional so go when it is the cheapest.  Do not stress over this.  Refuse to do it.  This isn't suppose to be stressful though some brides make it out to be.  My sister and I had/are having extremely low stress weddings.    As for the bachelorette party, my bridesmaids were very poor.  My sister found a place that did buy one get one free appetizers.  Then we went out to a bar with no cover that had cheap drinks.  We also had in the trunk something we mixed ourselves so you could take a drink before we entered the bar.  Everyone had an enjoyable evening and since people buy drinks for the wedding party, the maids only spent about $25 for the whole evening.  A bachelorette party doesn't have to be expensive.  My cousin had everyone over for a sleepover like when they were little.  Everyone watched romantic movies from the 80s, popped popcorn and ate chocolate ice cream and stayed up all night.  That cost the maid nothing since she either owned most of the movies or put them on her NetFlix queue.    As for your own wedding, why not see what you can share?  My sister was going to use my vases from my wedding.  You can buy many things used from other brides at 50%.  I bought one item each week from Michael's with my 40% off one item coupon.  I bought things the year before when they went on sale.  I was having a summer Tropical theme wedding so I bought tiki torches and tropical scented candles the fall before.    Be upfront with your budget.  As the only bridesmaid, you should be able to do your own hair/makeup, use your own shoes and even pick your own dress. It doesn't have to match anyone's!  Look in April/May at the end of prom season.  Ask the bride what color and spend one weekend searching.  Have someone plan a shower that same time so that you can come in Friday, dress shop, go to the shower Sat, and dress shop that night before you fly out Sunday.    The more upfront you are with your budget the more people can help you meet it.  I provided my bridesmaids with a free place to stay and their alterations.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Are you getting married where your fiance lives or where your sister lives (or somewhere else)? If it's the same location as your sister, the trips back and forth are happening because of your own wedding planning, not solely because of hers. It's tough planning a wedding out of town if you're doing that. Your sister knows you very well and understands your financial situation. Just be honest with her and talk this over with her - that you want to help all you can and will be the best bridesmaid you can be. If she hasn't done anything financially demanding yet, I wouldn't make it a big issue. You can be a bridesmaid and not go broke. Just make sure you have a say in cost of your dress and things like that - just maintain some say in the decisions when it affects your money. If she in your weddiing?
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	First I must say that I am sorry for your loss. I know it is hard but you will survive without him. I am sure he wouldnt want you sitting around sulking and pittying yourself. You should go on with your life. That's waht he would want. I can suggest this to you. Go out and buy yourself one of those picture locket pendants. You can put his picture in there and keep it close to your heart. But you have to move on with your life. Hang out with friends and just try to have some fun to take your mind off of it. Having fun doesnt mean that you dont love your brother. You should be celebrating, he is no longer suffering in this hell on earth that we all live in now. :(|`|v2D4Sao5aa	what the **** i dont get it ?|`|BzctzIcgaa	Ah, I would hang out with friends.|`|0Rp5soE9aa	I know how you are feeling, I lost my brother when I was 9 and he was 20. Just hang in there, it does get a little easier as time goes on.  Don't ever forget him and hold those good times you had with him.  That will last your entire life and maybe even into your childrens life if you pass those stories along. Friends & family are your best way to get through this. Talk with them, let it all out.  I'm sure your entire family has the same feelings and they need to talk as well. This will help in a big way.  Very sorry for your loss.
IkWcwsj8aa	he's transmitting his thoughts in to your dreams..|`|7lQp3nHhaa	I asked a question a while ago of "Does your g/f get mad at your for dreams she is having?"  Cuz my g/f was always having dreams of me with other girls.    Then some crazy girl on here told me to stop cheating on my girlfriend in real life and to just leave her alone so she doesnt get hurt anymore !    I was like WTF ?! I've never cheated on her, and I live with her and plan on marrying her. Things couldn't be better.    I dont think it means anything.|`|LHe1Algaaa	If he seems to be doing things that make you suspect while you're awake that's not a good sign.    I've had those dreams though, and my husband has never cheated on me. I think it's just a subconscious fear about losing the person you love. Besides, V-Day is right around the corner and that might play into it. It's essentially a nightmare that recurs. I wouldn't worry about it unless he's acting really weird in real life.|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	I agree with Kittie, it's probably just a subconcious concern that you'll lose him.  I don't believe dreams are omens of anything, they are just your brain talking to you.
7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Why should he give you any of his pay if you're separated?  That was a choice made by the two of you.    So that now means you need to take a big girl pill and learn to become financially independent.  And if you can't make it on your own, either find a roommate, or move back with your parents.    You do realize you will be losing all your benefits to the military; no more medical, housing, or commissary rights.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	You can't get any money unless you file for separation, then in a year it moves to divorce. Once you file for separation and move out he needs to give you enough money for housing and food, so it depends on where you live and whatnot.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	None. It's his pay. You can earn your own. Women are equal these days.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	Go see JAG... parasite|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	none. until you file for speration or divorce and ask for alimony he does not have to give yo uanything.
f1efa317fe3139e94297478f9b6af987aa	that is flirtatious, but guys like the attention and the response from girls, don't stress about it hun|`|EMjoB768aa	Idk i say she or he (whoever u are talking about) has issues.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Not really, he wasnt complementing her, just pointing out the obvious. relax.|`|3SWjKcAEaa	Lol you shouldn't stalk your bf like that. What is he is reading this right now?|`|XVUVrgmeaa	Definatly|`|Zca1PGERaa	sounds like hes telling her to put something on|`|BUvPi5ldaa	Liam isn't the girl might have been.|`|AvTdudk7aa	People!  This is why eighth graders cannot be on any social networking sites!

Don't worry yourself about it, hes your boyfriend after all (:|`|F6U9eM6Gaa	i don't think so i think he's just Curious about it. but if it gets any worse i would talk to him about it and tell him what's bothering you.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	YES VERY MUCH SO!!|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Ohhh dear. My best bet is to talk to him. It sounds like a flirtatious comment.|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	it's just a joke it MEANS nothing
AjFA8qIxaa	Well, do you understand where he's coming from?  You kept things from him, and now he found out, Of course it will be hard for him to trust you right now, and he will be worried that there might be more. You say there isn't but he only has your word for it and in his eyes, your word doesn't count much right now.  It doesn't give him the right to say hurtful things to you but i hope you understand that he's really upset right now. He has no trust in you which is a given.   You need to rebuild that trust but first you need to let him know that he needs to give you a chance to show you.  Explain to him why it was that you kept things from him. It wasn't to hurt him but to keep yourself from being hurt.  Tell him that you will work it out but that you both must want it.  If you want this then work for it. But he must want it too, otherwise your relationship wont stand a chance.  Hope everything works out!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Put a fork in it. it's done there is no trust in your relationship.|`|hLA8nFJ2aa	well i think you need to sit down and talk to him and make sure he can trust you with out that you dont have anything you no but i think you need to ask your self does he make me more happy with him or with out him
afFUs27kaa	make sure you do love her...got to rememebr there is a reason she is your ex wife. and although you miss her now thats because shes gone and we always want the things we dont have.|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	first i would start a friendship with her, try talking to her about her current boyfriend and tell her that he is no good for he. its very cruel to kick someone out of their house on the weekends, he might be cheating in her. anyways, once you guys devolp a friendship, things should be easier from there. if you dont want to come off too strongly then just tell her that you have been starting to devolp feelings for her again and you want to know how she feels before things get out of hand.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Start by asking her if she ever feels anything for you anymore, then if she says yes, tell you have too.  Ask her out again, and see where it goes from there.  After a few dates just straight up tell her you have loved her for a long time, and ask her if she will take you back.  Good luck!|`|WG1uTqOGaa	Take her out to dinner and start a conversation then it will eventally come out lol|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	say your sorry about the past, then keep a little more in touch. after a while tell her how you do feel.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Invite her out, Give her a rose, Look her in the eyes, Tell her how you feel, don't hold back, even if it makes you look like an ***, she might buy it and feel the same. If you never try you'll never know...|`|8QZBLRhaaa	my advise to you is to tell her your feeling because if she has came looking for you her feelings might be the same.when you are in a relationship you do not want to hurt the other person even tho you might be in love with someone else do what your first mind tells you to do because you would blame yourself if down the line you found someone and she said i always want you back but i never knew how you felt .if you love her put yourself out there i believe its truly worth it|`|ZWN3JJ4Iaa	You could do coffee and test the waters. Have a friendly chat and if the feelings mutual then, it will just run on its own course.  Sometimes things take time, do coffee, lunch, dinner etc. Good luck! x|`|3lRX0tHkaa	Just flat out say it. Girls like strong statements that compliment them.|`|f1efa317fe3139e94297478f9b6af987aa	call her, email her, text her, tell her some way or another, or else I WILL!
dF21EYSzaa	Kick his knees in and fart in his face.|`|e158WyFGaa	Just be who you want to be.|`|71vWjc8Qaa	Just be yourself.|`|egqveuPjaa	Just forget the entire thing and go back to being friends- otherwise it will be awkward!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Try to act like you did before. Show him it's not a big deal and maybe he will still want to be friends with you. Otherwise he might avoid you if he thinks you really like him|`|g4AAZRuxaa	The same you always did before.|`|TIDqJgdSaa	omg;  im about to ask out mii close GUY FRIEND.  i lke him soo much  but i dont know how he feels ://  and i dont wnana ask him out then be rejected :(   i wouldnt noe how to act around him =/  ahhh.  i want him thoo :(       were so alike :D|`|aGno0HAwaa	Ignore him when you see him and talk to his friends in front of him.|`|A65C8cmeaa	Just act normal like you always would, don't let him get you down.|`|H9k65Ve0aa	Smile and say hello and leave as quickly as you can.Or plan to have another guy on your arm to just walk with, then smile and say hello.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Just move on and just be friends with him.  If he makes a big deal out of it, tell him he is a scumbag and that he should go play hide and go f^ k himself.  Just try to make tings go back to normal.|`|ecNeN0staa	Act like a btch on wheels.  Poke him in the eyes!|`|XVUVrgmeaa	just play it down. don't bring it up when you talk to him. just act like you would if you didn't like him as much as you do. It something is supposed to happen it won't happen by forcing it.|`|AA11309717	You go on and do what you would do on a daily basis. Act like you normally would. He didn't say was no longer your friend, did he?    If what you are really saying is" I'm hurt and I'm not going to spend as much time with him as I did before because it's too painful to be around him" then still do what you would normally do only make sure you limit the face to face time between the 2 of you. (don't show up where you know he will show up, don't do the things that you know he would do, etc etc    Good Luck!|`|3cdd2992b76ad47f7bbe388c40089b65aa	dont let him get you down|`|4tDTQOgNaa	Just act how you would normally. Don't try to put on a show. Then he'll see something about you has changed and not for the better.|`|sp0JWXHFaa	Just act like you are better off without him.|`|3getUSKYaa	Just act normally.  Don't pay much attention to him.|`|ZWN3JJ4Iaa	Be yourself, dont let him think that you really care, that'll show him what he's missed. Women are so much more independent and even if we do get rejected, we can pick ourselves off and move on.  He obviously wasnt worthy of you! his loss!! and you can probably do s much better than him! x|`|1isE17ojaa	Act normal. Like nothing happend.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Act like nothing happened and without feelings toward him in anything but friendly. He doesn't want to feel weird either. Find a new interest in another man. That will help.|`|3lRX0tHkaa	Just ignore him.|`|XINOK7SKaa	if you are over it, then act like it didnt happen    i had the same thing happen to me, but luckily for YOU your guy friend isnt still messing with your head about it    Good luck!|`|nW7LZH6Aaa	Hey, this happened with me, but with a girl ( i am a guy), just continued like nothing had happened! It'll be fine, although he may be a bit distant for a bit. Thats awesome by the way, why can't more girls make the move, you rock! lol! c ;-)|`|Aa6IV2U9aa	the farting in his face sounds nice..      but in all seriousness. that would be extremly okward.    idk..  sorry.|`|HxqjMPH6aa	You do not need to act. Be yourself. If you are really close ,you have to be able to talk to him about it. If he does not feel the same way about you, then there is nothing you can do. Just remain friends. I am sure there will be many more guys for you in your life. Let it go.|`|NEfezEUQaa	act like you did when you were just friends|`|3JMEzpC5aa	Try and act cool with it, try to make sure your friendship doesn't get destroyed over it, its not worth loosing a good friend.|`|r7sgshwKaa	You just answered your own question. You said you were over it, but obviously you aren't or you wouldn't be looking for another answer. Its okay if he said he didn't feel the same way, don't take it personal. Maybe he has a girlfriend already or maybe......"hes just not that into you." Have a good day.|`|mULJMC0waa	If you still want to be friends then apologize and talk it over. You will have to gain his trust back. Just say you were sorry and you thought that you could take the relationship to the next level. Also say you would like to stay friends and I hope this didn't hurt our relationship. Most of the time it will work itself out but it takes time to heal especially if someone wasn't ready. I hope your friendship works out. Friends are one of the most important things to have.
VSVQHKwKaa	Every been turned on by some guy sending you a picture of his cock?    If this actually works....I"ve never heard of it.    The reason some guys do it is because guys are visual....and we'd like to see a picture of your private parts to turn us on.    Of course, this means that we're treating you like fellow guys, which is one of the reasons to avoid people who send you cock pictures.    A lot of girls puzzle (incorrectly) over guys, trying to figure out how to emotionally turn them on. This is a waste of time. What he wants is to see you in something silky and seductive. That's it. The emotions come later for men.     Consider also, the fact that women groom much more than men. This is almost never done for men's benefit. It's more about making the woman FEEL better about herself. However, a guy is visual and can be quickly attracted to a female who has her hair up and earrings on, and is wearing a silky dress.     Otherwise, girls would be dolling themselves up, and the guys would be wandering around, trying to figure out how to build an emotional connection with a girl on the middle of the dancefloor.     What a mess!|`|3cdd2992b76ad47f7bbe388c40089b65aa	because we said so.
FaS3CT5waa	a lot! im in unviesity to and its sucks, between work, school, and taking care of her ***...only reason im staying in its is for the sex ;)|`|HMhUKAgkaa	If you really like/love the person, then you wouldn't consider it work.|`|AaoLwJJWaa	well depending on the type of girl she is, yes it'll cost a bit more, whether they admit it or not, girls like gifts every now and then, but the most "burden" it could be is emotional, you'd be suprised about the things girls get upset over, one word of advice: whether she admits it or not, she'll be jealous if you have a meaningful conversation with any other girl, it's annoying at times, but worth it, again, depending on the girl|`|Tq98g20raa	quite a bit but think of the sex...|`|Q27cXlGbaa	alot. girls require alot of attention and have alot of needs.|`|NLxcfGplaa	I would hope that my boyfriend does't think of me as a burden!!!|`|KcUX0WCeaa	I'm currently a student at penn state and i spent a while single and I met a boy that I tried to get into a relationship with since my last serious one.  He was a real pain in the *** for me and being in a relationship was a lot of trouble.  I always had to worry about calling him, his getting jealous, his temper tantrums.  It just took up a lot of my time and effort and I didn't really have time for myself anymore.  Not to say that sometimes it wasn't nice.    All i have to say, is make sure this girl is chill and you want to wife her...otherwise, it's not worth it for a "just for the hell of it" deal.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Well if you find the right lassie it shouldnt be a burden at all. Spending time with her should be the exact opposite|`|8Q8ZVwjnaa	depends how badly you want to do her|`|dF21EYSzaa	None, if you tell them that you're in control.  Don't let bitches walk on you.|`|EpMwDI48aa	a girlfriend isn't 'work'. how horrible. I can't believe sum of the comments you've got aswell how sexist are you lot!|`|mULJMC0waa	If you only want sex, your a pig. If you are serious about getting married then it is a different thing. They are a lot of time and can be a burden but once you are married and have sex for the first time as husband and wife it all pays off. Good luck!|`|tRUoj8cPaa	You don't need extra work. Just go out where you can meet a lot of girl of your age. If you appreciate her, socialise with her, invite her for coffee a pastry, if you like her try meeting her often until you get to know each other or until you both feel you like each other .... there you go . Good luck.|`|762d3866ee7df60796cab3744e98a10aaa	I don't know why you say you are late. I had my first girlfriend at 34 (she's my wife now). Like, who expects what from you?  However... You need to be extra understanding and make a lot of compromises. You need to understand a big deal of your money is going to end up somewhere else now and there are things you used to do that you won't do anymore. You need to be tolerant and a very good listener. If you haven't, you need to improve your communication and conflict handling skills.  At least that's part of what I had to do.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	If you are viewing it as a burden, then you are not ready to engage in a relationship. The time spent with someone you love is a gift, not something to bemoan. All relationships require compromise. If you are expecting it to be convenient well you are going to be disappointed.|`|IMrer0csaa	worth it|`|QxC8xRgWaa	It depends on the girl. Some aren't enough work, and some are WAY too much!|`|3mMg3ETCaa	lots of work most girls are very high maintenance|`|v7VLM3y2aa	Try getting one first|`|pN6idIPqaa	well...everything you do in your life will mean to her...you will have to show her that she was never a trouble to you....there you start, its like a marriage, in fact this is a very hard work just to reach that point,,did you got it...stay in your life just as it is but show her how beatiful is life when she appeared in your life.....
LHe1Algaaa	That's normal, it's about the right age to start thinking about those things. Just don't do anything for a few more years.|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Thats absolutely normal .    When i was 12 I dreamt of sleeping with my class teacher. She was 26.
BUvPi5ldaa	Just say your going out with (whatever her name is) and your dad will proberz be like 'Just you two alone?' and then you can just say 'Yeah, I asked her out'  It's what I did =)|`|3cdd2992b76ad47f7bbe388c40089b65aa	uh... no clue
0rF1be2baa	true friends every time, i have a core group of 6 real good friends and i would be fine if they were my only friends. i don't see why people whould want to be popular but have no good friends who they can rely on. true friends stay with you through good and bad is pretty much the main thing. people who would go for the first option would have to be absolute whores for attention|`|F3LBgfvwaa	the second one    true friends are better than anything|`|lxSRIFK2aa	true friends|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Not popular with true friends. I hate plastic people.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	Always true friends|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Depends on you, would you rather have true friends or run with a pack fake deceitful people.  You can't trust them and they'll betray you.  Despite the peer pressure that says the opposite; you can be popular and have true friends.  You'll see over time that the people who are popular now will fade into the background and the true people will have the rest of their lifetime in the sun.  I know from experience.|`|LSMyk9VHaa	Popular with not very good freinds but im popular with good freinds|`|fM5TrioGaa	;Not being populr with TRUE freinds.
ecNeN0staa	Uh oh, he's falling in love with you.  Run!|`|Q5zIzEQGaa	It depends on the guy to tell you the truth. If he is a genuine person then maybe he truly regrets messing up the friendship. But if he is a player he might have already got what he wanted from you and don't want the emotional baggage.|`|DJwRCAFpaa	you have me a bit confused because im not sure if youre asking if he wants to sleep with you again or start dating you. it sounded like you two were sex buddies with a friendship on the side so if he was sleeping with you then i dont think he would ever not want to sleep with you but if he has "more than a friendship" feelings for you i would try to find that out. also, it depends on what you want. do you have those kinds of feelings towards him? if so, bring it up subtly
dcd11iUwaa	No id be upset too!  as your boyfriend he has an obligation to defend you against other people.  Im sorry but its obvious he just doesn't care.  I think you should find someone else, you sound like a lovely young lady and you deserve so much better.  good luck sweetie.x|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	The gaming thing you should overlook (as long as he gives you the proper amount of attention).    The laughing at you thing is kind of tricky. Did you try asking him why he's laughing? Maybe he was laughing at the situation and not necessarily you. I mean think about it, there he is sitting with his girl playing games and two dudes, start accusing his girl of being a guy. If that was me I'd find it kind of fun that they could confuse my girl with a guy.    Now as far as you sounding a little like a guy (because of your throat problems) and him not standing up for you, maybe he didn't think it was any of their business. Why didn't you try explaining it to them? Why do you feel he should have been the one to stand up for you? Aren't you capable of taking care of yourself?    Just talk to him about this calmly. Tell him you would like his support in situations like that. Tell him you weren't comfortable with him laughing like he did.     As far as him adding people to his friends list, well that's really not a big thing. People like to talk **** in those situations, it makes you angry and they get to laugh because you can't do anything about it and it makes you play worse. I don't really know what to tell you about this one. Maybe ask him to remove them. *Shrug* Sorry I can't help on this point.|`|c2uywBsIaa	NO YOU ARE NOT!!!  Your man should have had your back. I can't imagine how upset I would be if my boyfriend joined in on the "fun" and laughed like those idiots that know nothing about you and your past. He on the other hand knows...and should have known better.|`|V5akMpDAaa	no, you're not over-reacting. you should talk to him about it.|`|ee61e5c9182f80497740aeecc845e0edaa	Get out, it will only get worse once you are married and he feels like he 'owns' you.    RUN!|`|AA11842750	aw thats just sad. You should ask him to really stop n be more considerate n aware of your feelings. Esp after having gone through a different form of abuse. He should be uplifting you.|`|G537VEYSaa	well maybe hes not the one for you if he cant learn to have sympathy and compassion for you and not make fun of you, he should have told thoose guys to go to he** , that was very rude of him, i think you should have a long talk with him.|`|RvddYKqjaa	No one wants to be made fun of in front of others, or alone. Your fiance  is not a very nice guy. Don't allow him to treat you that way. You are much better than that.  EDIT: His note to his buddies just compounds his lack of respect for you. I feel for you. I'm not sure that talking will change him. You've told him how you feel. Are you sure you want that for a life partner? It only gets worse.|`|JsffWlnEaa	sounds immature.....i'd go back to being single|`|AA10874773	i'd be livid.  you deserve better than that girl.  if this is the norm for him as far as your concerned - dump him.|`|GTjkWZPlaa	I don't think you are over-reacting.  I find it extremely disrespectul, especially when he knows your past.  I would talk it out with him and tell him how you feel.|`|rd3TjWWXaa	Not at all you had all the right to be upset. You don't need to be with someone that is going to abuse you emotionally He needed to stand up for you, cause it wasn't funny.|`|AvwveaQvaa	your definitely not overacting. your fiancee should be there to defend you and protect you not be there to make fun of you. you should talk to him about how that made you feel especially when it brought back memories just talk to him and tell him that it was right of him to do that. that's not right and im sorry about your vocal cords i hope you get well|`|xlPHWQQSaa	It sounds like you have relationships with men who definitely don't put you above everything and everyone else.  If he is not taking up for you now imagine what it will be like in 5 years.  I think you should take a serious look at your fiance and ask is he really the one for me.|`|AA12318686	I would not marry this guy!!!    This disrespect will only get worse, when you are married there will be opportunities 24 hrs. a day, 7 days a week for him to make fun of you , not defend you, go against your wishes and make you do things that you don't want to do. People are on their best behavior before they are married. He is only going to get worse with this and he will not be there for you at all. It's all about him.  Why get tied up financially and emotionally with this guy. Pleeeeeasssse !  Do Not Marry His Sorry .... Self !|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You have a right to be angry! Your fiance is going to be your husband.

Whats worse is he was laughing along too.You have every right to be mad,I'd let him have it too.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	i would be hurt too although am sure him laughing wasn't with bad intention you know. Let him know that it deeply hurt you because of what your throat/voice is associated to (ex-husband) and he should calm down about it and apologize. If he goes on making fun then am afraid he's not very mature. About the 2 other guys since nonce of you really know them they are of no importance, they might have thought it was a joke or something. Guys are usually stupid when something serious is happening they are not comfortable and know nothing else to do than laugh and pretend it's all a joke|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Good indicator that you have once again choosen a loser and an insensitive creep. Find someone who really cares about you.|`|DxohE884aa	That's annoying. But being called a man isn't always an insult...  If your fiance saw that you were upset, he should have stood up for you. If this were just a little relationship I'd say dump him you're too good, but you should probably work this one out.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Does he play Dungeons and Dragons too? geek.    Eat Funyuns.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Sounds like he is immature.  Maybe he isn't the one.  Find a guy who isn't into gaming and making fun of you in front of others?|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Find a guy who will respect you and have some compassion for your feelings.  He will do this to you as long as you are with him.|`|AA11945637	yes, you are over reacting|`|AA11603468	It hurt your feelings--enough said. Your finacee's job is to be your right hand--always! His first priority is (or should be) you. He's wrong here.
sLLgERQWaa	Four legged bridal attendants. ?????????    I can cope with anything at a wedding but when you turn your bridal processional into a parade from Noah's Ark....I mean I love my pets but they just don't belong as flower girls and ring bearer's...and I'm looking at it from the pet's perspective...they would be happier left at home rather than dressed up and paraded in front of a whole bunch of strangers....    also do-overs....drives me nuts when people decide it's okay to get married and have a fancy wedding later and pretend they are not married in order to have the whole fancy virginal white gown bridal attendants thing....what's with that? If it's a deployed serviceman then yes, if there's a serious illlness in the family, okay, but just because you can't wait & save or didn;t like the way your real wedding turned out? What ever happened to living with the choices you make...jeeze I should be so entitled to re-do all the things in my life I don't like or didn't turn out the way I expected. I'm waiting for do-over funerals, birthday parties, and births lol.    ...and best (or worst) of all 'Stealing thunder'...do any of the gals crying this know where it comes from?    It's a theater term refering to applause...when one hammy actor upstages the other and receives the applause the other actor deserves, they are stealing one's thunder(the noise made by applause). So, are brides hammy actors having their applause stolen...I thought it was a wedding and all about getting getting married, not a staged show for attention.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	tossing the bouquet, I hate being singled out as a single girl since I'm not as young as the bridesmaids who always go bananas for the bouquet.  also the veil is antiquated, it's meant to keep evil spirits away or something?

The....I'm having a quick wedding in June, but then our "real" wedding will be next March when we have more money!    Huh?

Otherwise, just have the 1 wedding.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i dont get why it is such a fuss if i want to wear a colored dress.  my dress is red, head to toe, and i wouldnt have it any other way.  im not a traditional bride, so i dont want what is considered a traditional dress.  i try explaining to people that no one wore white till queen victoria, but no one seems to care.  no one has outright told me "if you get married in red your a sinner" or whatever, but i can tell that the few people who know what color my dress is are slightly on edge.  my fiance is ok with it, im ok with it, and the bridal party is completly ok with it.  but my older reletives are slightly more conservitive than i am.    also, someone above me mentioned that if the couple is not part of a culture that does the dollar dance as part of their culture, then they shouldnt do it. i agree.  my fiance and i DO happen to have roots in a culture that does it (my grandparents were first generation in america) so we are doing it to honor our roots.  not for any sort of greedy money grubbing reason.  trust me, i have a difficult time letting people buy me lunch, i am NOT the money grubbing sort.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	"Adults only" weddings. I know that some people don't like kids, and that some weddings take place later in the evening when most kids should be in bed. But, at least in my family, a wedding is a family event. It's not a black-tie cocktail party. It's about celebrating the people in your life that matter to you, including kids. And I've never seen a wedding ruined by a kid, or a kid taking attention away from the couple.    I also hate the refrain "it's MY day!" No, it's not. At the very least, it's you and your fiance's day. And really, it's a day for everyone who cares about you. The comfort and ease of your guests should get as much consideration as the bride's "wedding vision."|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	Some might not agree with me on this, that's fine, it's just my opinion. But I don't get the trend of a non-white dress.    I know in traditional Indian weddings the sari is red. That's their culture.    But I don't know why some one would want a black dress for example.  I guess I'm just really traditional.    Again, just my opinion.    EDIT:  Sorry for my supposed stupidity.|`|q8eue7CRaa	How expensive it all is!|`|b91eddc5073c6854422022b5397415e4aa	I've seen this on a couple of wedding shows: the "Walking dessert table". A couple hires a performer/actor to walk around the reception in a big gown, and the skirt of the gown is a table covered in desserts. I don't understand the appeal of this at all, and if I was at a wedding that had one it would just creep me out. Here's a picture example, there's just no desserts on the table in the pic:      http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y103/th...|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I know this is against etiquette and some people will disagree, but I "don't get" the requirement that if you invite co-workers to your wedding that the invite MUST include their spouses.    Its not like the spouse is likely to know anyone else at the wedding.  Because I work with someone, I may feel they are a friend, but I very likely have never met their spouse.  Co-workers are going to know eachother so they can be eachothers company during the wedding.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I don't get the whole trend of smearing wedding cake in each others' face.  I mean...one of your first public acts as a married couple is to treat your new spouse so disrespectfully as to smash cake in their face...all for a laugh???|`|mesqZ1mUaa	I don't get the idea that a bride is the only person in the world who can wear white or ivory on her wedding day.    Do you really think that a guest wearing a mostly white dress will be mistaken for the bride? Did you really invite that many people who have no clue who you are? It's your name on the invitation and you standing up in front of everyone. Who cares that someone sitting in the next-to-last-row has a white floral-print dress on? Is she really trying to steal your thunder, or just wearing a dress she likes and feels good in?    It never ceases to amaze me that brides think they have the right to be insulted that a guest wore a similar color. If someone showed up in a wedding or prom gown, then yes, you can be insulted. If it's just a sundress, be glad that they cared enough to show up to support you and get over the color choice.
AA11312653	Let's not confuse tradition with etiquette. Even etiquette guru Judith Martin (Miss Manners) tells us that traditions which are distasteful or impracticable should be "discreetly edited out" of weddings. People may urge you to follow tradition or express dismay when you do not, but they can't rightly say you have been been rude.     Another respondent defends the practice of hosting showers for members of ones own family. To her I say: To host a fund raiser for a needy bride who is not a relative is gracious and generous. To host a fund raiser for your own family is greedy. That this form of greed may be gaining social acceptance in some circles does make it any less greedy. These relatives have the option of giving a luncheon, dinner, or other sort of party to honor the bride but CHOOSE to demand gifts from guests. How is this NOT greedy?    Thank you for letting me address that.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Well I am in the UK and to correct a point here not all wedding cakes are made of fruit, yes traditionally they were but we do have sponge cakes for weddings too.  I am getting married in June but we are having a 5 tier traditional Italian wedding cake, this is pastry/sponge soaked in liquer with chantilly cream and more sponge/pastry on top. Then its iced so this will not keep until the birth of a baby in fact it will not keep a couple of hours out of the fridge so we are not that tradtional.  I say go with what you want to do most people have babies before they marry anyway nowadays and since this will be mine and my fiances second wedding there will not be any babies coming along, we have 4 between us.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Because it's tradition.  There so many useless traditions out there that are still in use and not just pertaining to weddings either.  We still hold on due to some reason or another, sentimental value, nostalgia, whatever.     I say, let them eat (stale nasty) cake.|`|mxrlZEweaa	I think some people like tradition, that's why it's called tradition.     If you don't want to save the top tier of your cake then don't.     If you don't want to follow any other traditions, then don't.     It's not that hard to tell someone that's it your wedding and you are going to do things your way. You don't have to be mean or rude, just politely decline the suggestion.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Why? Because it's tradition.  Point blank.      About the tier of cake.  If someone makes a fuss about me NOT saving it and freezing it, I'll simply tell them that I do not wish to do this and that's that.  Same thing goes for not wanting to wear white.  If they fuss about, I'll tell them to wear white.  I don't want to.  If they fuss about me having "proper" RSVP cards then I tell them to order them, mail them and keep up them themselves.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	you dint have to do the traditions..but for some people is important..for me im not traditional now..but i know i was raised to be, and my family is very traditional..so im in between..im going to have nice wedding with different things but i will still keep some traditions specially because we are both from different countries and in my culture we have so many nice things to do on your wedding day..i dint want to miss it..    im not even doing it for my family. i think it adds something unique to our wedding,|`|sLLgERQWaa	I have no trouble changing, creating, or foregoing traditions as long as etiquette (good manners) are left in place.    As far as saving the top tier of the wedding cake..yuk!    I am a retired baker and I can tell you any cake no matter how well wrapped is subject to changes in taste, texture, and freezer burn after 6 months.     My wedding cake was a three tiered carrot cake with cream cheese icing...the top tier had no walnuts, pineapple or raisin for our guests who wanted plain carrot cake.    I did not save the top tier....we served it...no left over cake either.    Every anniversary I make a miniature version of our cake...fresh, delicious and the same recipe (I know because my second daughter who trained in my bakery made our cake lol) I even use our original cake topper.    Good luck.|`|woOeYFrEaa	My favorite nonsensical tradition is the "something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue and a sixpense for your shoe."    Do you know David's Bridal sells a "sixpense" coin for like $25 that people actually pay so they can walk on a coin all day?    I honored and followed traditions that had meaning and made sense to me.  We didn't do a unity candle (or even worse, unity sand).  We did decide not to see each other the day of the wedding because it was special to see him react to seeing me enter in my dress.  We didn't do the bouquet toss (years of feeling like a humiliated single when I was the only adult out there with a bunch of 12 year olds) or the garter toss (letting people watch my husband grope under my dress, no thanks).    We did do the cake topper just because that seemed kind of romantic.  We'll probably unwrap it, look at it and happily toss it, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	I totally agree with you.      For example:  I think it is completely acceptable for the mothers to host the wedding shower.  These days the couple is usually footing the entire bill and the mothers want to honor their children with an event, such as the shower.  How is this considered in bad taste?  Perhaps in olden times, it would be considered benefiting the families, but not in today's society.    I wish people would stop quoting etiquette as if it were gospel and not just social graces.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	wow!  I didn't know that but it makes sense, you can't freeze cake with eggs milk and lard in the frosting and then eat it and not get sick!  just smile and nod at the naysayers and tell them whatever, I'll take the cake home, then chuck it or better yet, bring your leftover cake and food from the caterer to your local mission or shelter.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	im kind of half and half.  there are some traditions i think should  be stuck too, but others that should just get thrown out the window as soon as possible.      like, no one wore white wedding dresses till queen victoria did, and she did it as a sign of wealth, not purity.  cept now a days that meaning has gotten twisted from wealth to purity and most girls who choose to wear a dress of a differant color get looked down upon.  my dress is red head to toe, and i wouldnt have it any other way. other cultures have colored dresses, and MOST cultures did it before queen victoria showed up in white, so why the heck not? the white dress tradition can go right out the window as far as im concerned.  i never wanted a solid white dress, i always wanted color     i am strangly picky about the no mothers hosting showers thing though.  my mom has had two wedding showers at her house now, but on both invites someone else was listed as host.  and for some reason that is one tradition i just cant get off of.       and i just wanna throw this one out there.  i live in wisconsin.  here, it is PERFECTLY acceptable to go bar hopping between the actual wedding and the reception.  i dont plan on doing it but i have reletives from illinois who seem completly flabbergasted at the idea that there are wisconsin wedding parties that go from bar to bar instead of taking pictures or having a cocktail hour before the reception.  anyones thoughts on the matter? or any other people in differant states that do it?
MWjNp6y3aa	WTF...did the mormons move in on this one or what. Look moving in together is seen a sin by Christians so they are going to piss all over your parade. However I am one and have been married without really knowing the person all that great.     Dating is different than being a friend.  Living together is different than just dating.  Being married is different than living together and dating.    I think a few months then try it out. Don't get the bills intertwined though. That is a problem. Make sure you both know what your expectations are. Who cleans, who cooks and none of this "we will both be doing it" because that statement doesn't work here in reality. Trust me I have done this before.     Try after 4 months. 2 years of successful cohabitation and then you probably are ready for marriage. No amount of dating can prepare you for living with the person you are dating. Not even years.|`|6XqY0istaa	Ok, I know that this is not going to be the answer you are looking for, but my advice would be.....  when you've married this person.  People think that living together first is a good way to "try it out", but if you look at the marriage statistics (those ugly ones that say over half of marriages fall apart), cohabitation is one of the factors correlated with increased risk of divorce.  Living together now is nothing like it would be if you were married, so it's not a good way to figure out if you're going to work with this person.  Now is the time for both of you to have your own space and maintain your own lives as you share those lives with each other (but not merge them by sharing an address).  If you want to brush your teeth next to this person every morning and take turns going to the store for milk, maybe you should seriously take a look at the possibility of making a lifelong commitment- no halfway attempts!    Now, if you absolutely hate that piece of advice and are determined to move in together anyway, I would then say to wait at least six months.  That's right- six months.  Why?  Because most relationships that aren't going to last will fail before then and you'll save yourself and this other person a lot of pain by waiting to complicate things in this way until your relationship has stood the test of time.      Anyway, best of luck to you guys, whatever you decide to do!|`|sXT86Swqaa	Moving in together is a bad idea until you actually marry. I say this because it's just another occasion where the temptation to sin is too great.|`|71yXXY3eaa	You should not move in with each other until you get married.  It is a great idea to save sex until marriage; to save such an activity with one person is very helpful towards making the relationship special and durable.  Waiting until marriage to have sex is a sacrifice but it is a noble sacrifice that will enable both spouses while married to more easily make other sacrifices.  Once married, you will look back and be thankful that you waited that long to have sex.  It is worth it.|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	2 days|`|DJwRCAFpaa	moving in i would think depends on your age, current living situation, financial situation, your intentions towards the person, among other things. i say about a year|`|d8yrvK4waa	6 hrs    SteveC

Or agree to pay your own way and bring him a gift card and a note too, so he doesn't know whats up until the check comes.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Wow, you are really petty.

The real question is, what does he see in you?|`|AA12017096	Stop Sponging off him|`|n8Db77zbaa	At least he was kind enough to tell you in advanced and not after you've already ate the meal. You should just be grateful, that up until now he's been paying for you.     It doesn't matter that a bike doesn't cost much... who ever gave you that idea was wrong anyway, I'd like to see them shell out a few grand from their pockets and pay for your meals at the same time. Maybe he's hard up on money, majority of the people are these days you know.     He's not obligated to take care of your half of the bill, you aren't his girlfriend or wife.     All I am saying is, that if you decide to go out with him to eat or have fun, expect to pay for yourself.|`|satoCRC6aa	move on , he is|`|xQn3rR6Naa	He has told you that if you want to go out with him it will be on your own dime so go in front of him at restaurants and such and take out your cash and pay for yourself or don't go.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Handle it by not being a mooch and pay your own way.|`|R75tldc8aa	You should pay it.  He isn't your boyfriend, and even then I don't believe guys should have to pay for everything. He probably isn't earning anymore money then you are. So if you're set on buying a bike, do less.|`|jPESbdyyaa	You pay your own way and stop expecting him to pay for everything for you.  He's a friend, not your man.  His money is his and how he spends it or saves it isn't your business.  Why are you getting offended?      If he offered to pay in the past, then you should not feel stupid for not offering to pay before, so don't worry about that.  He probably gave you the heads up so you'd bring money and not expect him to pay.
58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	well, you sound like a confused little girl. 11 is an interesting age because its when you just start to notice your sexuality. Its not bad or wierd or anything.

Or he can go do something with his friends or alone and you can do your thing. You guys don't have toalwayss be together but the key is for you to talk to him. Let him know how you feel and see if you guys can work it out. My boyfriend is super active. He has to be doing something all the time or he gets jittery.

There isn't really much for me to do on a regular basis, so he doesn't expect me to do much. The most I usually have to clean is our bathroom, especially after washing my hair. He's a SAHD to our 4 1/2mo old daughter and I work 8hrs. Although he's home all day, I still take inventory of what's not done so that I can do it and give him a break. I'm a paralegal and I sit down all day so since my job is easy, I try to make his easy too. It's be different if I was working construction or doing hard labor or something because then I wouldn't lift a finger around the house, when he was home all day and could've done it. However, I can count on one hand with fingers to spare, the last time I got home and the house wasn't clean.     When he goes back to work, the household duties will probably be split like they were before I had the baby. We picked rooms out of a bowl to clean and were responsible for that room. He's always done the majority of the cooking. But, he has NEVER expected me to do all the housework so we have always shared the responsibility of keeping the house up. Drawing responsibilities is the only fair way to distribute duties because the rooms in our apartment are all different sizes and some have more activity- meaning more of a mess than others. But, our apartment is never really messy because we both try to pick up after ourselves, our 10yr old son spends most of his room, and our baby is too little to have to pick up after.|`|6YTSD3pdaa	Yes, my husbands helps with homework and he also help around the house. he washes dishes and also vacumes and take care of the trash.. he sometimes he washes his working clothes... he is really helpfull around tha house..|`|AA10886262	we do them together....he normally will do the laundry (we both fold and put away - I do the socks, he hates matching socks) and vacuum....and I will cook and do dishes (he washes the silverware, I hate washing silverware), dust...clean bathrooms....taking the trash out is for whichever one of us sees the trash needs to be taken out|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Yes, he does housework. There is no set chore list. He lives here, he helps. It's up to him how and what he chooses to do.  He does chores every day though. He usually helps with dishes, vacuuming, some laundry, sweeping, toy pick-up, cleaning glass, major stuff, not the details of organization or stain removal, or toilet cleaning type stuff.  He does not expect me to do everything. I have 3 kids and I homeschool so I simply cannot or nor should I.    In all fairness, I got a great man. He has never, ever let me down and is highly capable. All husbands I know could not hold a candle to him.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	He does outside maintenance (lawn mowing, snow removal, raking, that sort of thing). He takes out the trash and recycling whenever full and also the end of the driveway every week for pickup, he does the kitty litter a couple times a week, and he does most the laundry.    Occasionally when the mood strikes him he might do more, dishes (we don't have a dishwasher) or some other cleaning... He was good about it when I have been really sick, he'll help out more.    In general house cleaning is my realm, out door stuff is his|`|1c98ba0da76082f194ab437ed318f277aa	I am a husband, and here is what I do around the house.    I do laundry daily (Wash & Dry, wifes puts away)  I plan weekly dinner menu, do the food shopping, and cook dinners.  I clean kitchen after dinner.    Currently, I have no choice but to take care of dinner, because my wife works evenings, but since I am a food service professional, I have always done it.|`|f6YsGOynaa	He's learning to do it without griping...that's a huge step for us.  He does his share, and the chores vary, but I still have to clean the bathrooms, and he takes care of the floors.|`|R4F05z4Faa	it's a case of totally mutual understanding.|`|mqi6h7gdaa	Ok, yes there are guys out there that do do housework. It took me some time to figure out that being selfish and not helping out doesnt get you very far. My wife started going out with friends and i think having an affair because i would leave her home with kids and leave all the housework for her to do. I know i was an azzhole.  But after 3 days of coming home to a dirty house i figured it out plus she was gone and i had to do it myself.  That was about 6months ago and ever since then i might miss one day a week of not picking up the house.     I do dishes, pick up house, pick our room, vacum and laundray every day  Really scrub bathroom, mop and dust once a week.    Basically i do everything and my wifes attitude has changed, but our sexlife still sucks  hasnt helped that out. SHe cant be tired i fricking do everythng now and take care of the kids a lot more.    I would say if he is helping out as much as i do, make sure your keeping him happy in the bedroom and your marriage should be fine. Otherwise, like me almost to this point, we might go looking for attention elsewhere.  We have feelings too, show us some appreciation and we will continue doing what we are doing.  Mop floors|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	50/50|`|x02jsjg6aa	He also goes to work for 8 hours a day and my job is keeping our house, so I do most of it.  But he does offer to help when he sees that I am worn out.|`|mxrlZEweaa	My husband does nothing but complain about the mess. He is supposed to take the trash out, but yeah that never happens. He works 40-60 hours a week so I give a little leeway but I think he should do more.|`|3hEa481faa	70/30|`|4V3LVIc4aa	he cooks and cleans up and does laundry. he helps with our son. he does help when ever it is needed or i ask. he cooks maybe 2-3 nights a week. i had surgery last week so he has been helping more often since then.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Yes he does help me.  We both do what needs to be done.  We don't have a percentage that we go on.  If it's dirty and he sees it, he washes it, if I see it, I wash it....and so on.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	80/20.  LOL His idea of cleaning the bathroom is flushing the toilet!|`|g6Lz8bFUaa	My wife and I share the responsibilities 60/40 LOL!!!!|`|yWBmZrfAaa	Both of us work full time outside the home so we share it roughly 50/50.  If something needs to be done we just do it.  Sometimes we each do our own thing, sometimes we do it together.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	There are some things he does that I just cannot do, this includes anything to do with the vehicles we own, any repairs, and vacuuming, I really hate vacuuming lol I also HATE loading the dishwasher, I can unload it, but if I load it I end up throwing everything in.  As for laundry, we share that 50/50, if you got laundry to do, put on a load, toss mine in with yours, and whoever is around to switch does so, and who's ever around to fold does so to, only because laundry is just never ending, its constant in our home.    I do all the bathroom cleaning, but I dont mind, because again, hes the handyman around here, I think we both share the daily stuff, the cooking and the after math of dinner, and if I ask him to do something, and as long as I dont nag him endlessly about it, and praise him afterwards, he'll pretty much do anything I ask him to do.|`|0WstfAmzaa	I really can't complain when it comes to housework.  While I probably tackle the majority of it, my husband is really good at helping out.  He'll do anything I ask him to (other than laundry) but is usual chores are: water changes for the fish tank, washing all the floors after I've swept up, garbage and recycling... And then he helps me with other cleaning up if I need it..   So I guess you could say we share the responsibilities, but it's probably 80/20 when you really come down to it.. :)|`|lzooHi0Baa	Our responsibility is to share our needs.   There are no assigned tasks.  We just try to make each other's lives more comfortable whenever we can.  If he gets home tired one day, I will take out the garbage.  If I am not feeling well or have to complete a job assignment, he will offer to help me with the dishes.   Its all about caring for each other with no descrimination, only love and consideration|`|sLLgERQWaa	Nope.  he takes out the trash.....puts his dirty laundry in the hamper.....always leaves the toilet seat AND lid down, Always puts the cap back on the toothpaste, ALWAYS hangs up his wet bath towels, goes to work every day & supports us, calls every night before leaving work to give me a heads up on starting supper & to see if we need any odd or end brought home.    I am a stay at home Mother of 4 adult kids, 2 on their own, two in 'transit' and working full time. Home Owner's Association handles outside maintenance (we have a condo/detached cottage home). I do all the house chores, laundry (mine & his), cooking, gardening ( I have a small flower bed) and still have time for Hobbies ( I refinish furniture & craft as in jewelry making, crochet,sewing, counted cross -stitch among other stuff) I also do all the interior decorating & painting.    We both have 'Me' & 'We' time....and we take great vacations, weekend trips, day trips, and go on 'dates' often.    Life is good.|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	Well we're not married (legally) and he does help with housework.  He works full time while I remain unemployed so I feel that as the homemaker, it is my job to keep the house tidy, clean, keep up with the laundry, cooking, guiding the kids with homework, enforcing Hygiene, etc. is my job.  Yet, he stills insists on helping out with dishes and helping with everything else whenever he can.  He is a real sweetheart!|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	He tries to but honestly ,I'm pretty picky and a bit of a control freak. (i know and accept this flaw about myself! lol) And since I know it won't be done just the way I want and I don't want to nitpick over what he did, I just do it myself. I appreciate that he wants to help though so whenever I see him starting to do something I just go over and give him a big kiss and gently steer him away so he doesn't mess up my system! He's decided that this is a form of insanity on my part! Maybe so but hey it keeps him from having to do anything around he house and he doesn't even get in trouble for it so I think he should be glad that he married a crazy chick! ;-)|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	we share 50/50. if there's something that has to be done then whomever is home does it.
OHfZFR31aa	Next time you see him, casually ask "so, did you ever find a date for your school dance." If he says no, then say "If you don't find anyone, I would be happy to go along with you" and see what he says.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I think you should ask him flat out....especially if he brought it up to you....When is the dance? You could pretend you forgot about it and see if he wants to do something that night, when he says he has a dance, be like, oh thats right...are you going? Then he will either say yes, alone or yes with someone or no hes not....go from there!
KTNqah9eaa	Maybe it's time you started to earn your own living and not depend on your mother.|`|96HWpdkFaa	That is not drama...lol obviously you havn't had much family drama in life.    Just act responsible show her you can handle your money.    It also depends how old you are...if your 17 or younger then she's doing the right thing.|`|3bApbb2yaa	how old are you?|`|Q5jJ05Qqaa	Get a job and use your own money, like most people.|`|8iYVHA1raa	If you are under 18, deal with it, you have no business buying property etc.    If you are OVER 18 - Move out and start living like a big boy and stop depending on Mommy!|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	How old are you?  You mentioned you don't have any assets of your own, but your mother is "holding on to them."  What does that refer to?  Is there some money that you have inherited or something that she refuses to turn over to you?  Or are you expecting her to give you money?  Clarify please.    If you are 16 or older, go get yourself a part-time job while you are in school.  If you are out of school, go get a full-time job, open your own bank account and start saving your own money so you can start reaching for your goals.  You may fall, but most people do from time to time.  You pick yourself up and continue to move forward.  For some reason your mother has money issues (were her own parents poor, gamblers, spendthrifts, miserly?), and these are now making you crazy.  She believes she is doing what is right for the family, and perhaps she is, because we don't have the whole story here.  If you are still young, you are stuck until you are old enough to start getting yourself some financial independence.|`|XqDTyY6Yaa	SDFSADFSADFSADFSDFSA|`|xbqYQYs3aa	tell her its your life and your money. tell her that u r improving and that you are responsible. u really need her to trust you!!|`|akHzd0izaa	dont fail get your grades up to all A's for a while and tell her for every A i get blah blah so just compromise on some stuff or just sit her down and just have a nice quiteeasy going conversation      from :guru friend|`|Mdxy405maa	how old are you? if your under 18 ... you should be glad there is somone for you...     and just hink about if she picked up her hands.. and u were on your own would you be able to handle it?|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	I felt my mom was the exact same way. I remember getting really upset when she told me I don't own anything, I should have more money saved than I do, and I should have more than I do for my age. I just started a new job and making more money. It's hard starting out. Just let her know you're trying your best and to stop worrying. It's your life and you should be able to live it the way you want. She already lived her life now its your turn to learn and make your own mistakes. Thats why its called life.|`|paCHaDWVaa	Well if you live at home, are young, and don't pay bills, you shouldn't complain. Im 24, married with 2 kids. I put my parents through hell when i was a teen and i regret every second of it. They really one want what is best for you. And if you have done something in your past to take trust away the only way to get it back is to earn it...|`|mULJMC0waa	Are you out of college or at least 18? Hire a lawyer and file legal actions against here. If you are relying on her for items and you are still in school I would just wait it out or just leave all together. She can't stop you if you are not there. I just hope you do it on good terms you don't want to ruin the relationship with your mom. It will be better off to talk to her about this in a clam manner. You can always sit down with her and one of her friends and see why she is doing what she is doing. If there is a friend of her's that you know you may want to ask them to sit in on the conversation. They can be a mediator for the both of you. Also setup a plan so your mom can see that you want to invest in something. For example you want to put 100 dollars away each pay check to start a down payment on a house. Or something like that. I wish you the best of luck.
T1ffrjHAaa	I think its the person themselves thats important. If I liked the person and wanted to be with them it would not bother me if she was either A or B....or any other letter for that matter.|`|AA11618168	Yes|`|ft8t98Pnaa	B....|`|dDDAbqqhaa	B    Or i'd want to be with a girl who is normal, doesn't wear tons of make up, doesn't have pictures of herself all over Facebook and Myspace, and one who will work hard, play hard,  talk to me and love me.    Just my personal view of course|`|ajPHMliqaa	B..as long as she does the bizz|`|YmLezz03aa	b...... you pretty much said it all.   you want to have fun, get dirty, watch her pick her nose and not be afraid of not looking great all the time. it makes it all easier|`|IPS3hWweaa	type B please! Its just more comfortable being with a girl who is real and is able to be herself. Eventually we'll see you without your make up on, so a girl had better be ready for that day, and I don't think type A would ever be ready for that.|`|ANcCxdEfaa	Definitely B!|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	Neither.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	Oh A_A_A_A+_A_A_ all the way a girlie girl|`|YyFexhd3aa	how each of them look first if they are both pretty i will go with no 1|`|HhugjHIAaa	Neither... You must be able to switch b/w A and B as per his desire.|`|tNfjre0Laa	YOUR  question does not make sense because all guys think differently just like all girls|`|eZltpbHeaa	Definitely B!! I just wouldn't get on with Girl A - she sounds cold.|`|8Q8ZVwjnaa	Id rather have a nice oily man|`|FHRfTlCxaa	If I was a guy,I would say B..|`|s9deNhXLaa	B|`|03GQ637Raa	Combine both A & B|`|WU7wpxe7aa	B  if i was with a girl actin like A il dump her straight away|`|ioKKaSvEaa	I rather have a a friend that a girl that just treat u as a m8|`|WChr31Otaa	In the beginning of the relationship I would go for the qualities in A. But over time the B qualities will have to prevail if I want to get serious with her. A good balance of both A and B will make any male happy. Good luck finding a good guy.|`|AA10857451	Girl b. because she really sounds like my ideal girl.|`|AA12271834	There is a saying:  "Guys will sleep with the blond but go home with the brunette"    A "mysterious" girl is fun to be with for a while but if you are looking for a long term relationship you want to have a more open and trust based relationship.  Being flirty is always good as long as it is only directed towards the guy (a lot of guys don't like "their" girl flirting with others).  Being flirty can keep the romance and passion in the relationship (a must for guys).|`|LyFaBLSJaa	Definately B)   but  the flirtacious part only with me, nobody else. lol. The whole seeing them without makeup on, that would be a major plus. So many girls have natural beauty and they just dont realize it because all the ads and commercials, bilboards, etc... in this world keep saying they have to keep doing more to themselves tbecaujse they arent good enough. :)    ex: your picture is very nice and i guarantee you look just as great w/o makeup!   spread the word: Girls are naturally beautiful!! lol  l8r days my friends|`|yyIVrngcaa	B. for sure, a real down to earth girl who isnt scared of being natural.|`|hq0VAXDbaa	B, mistery is good but you never know what they might do, u never know were you stand and its too complicated.    i girl whos treats me as a mate is ok but i cant be just as a mate, it also has to feel like a relationship, E.G the kissing the hugging, dates, sex etc... for me a girl who i can easaly have a lagh with is realy good because if you dont have the same humour it can be quite tediose and quite boring no make up is also good, i dont know why, but girls actualy look better with very little or no make-up + i know that girls tend to feel almost naked without makeup, like theyve gone out in their PJs or something, so yeh.. B!|`|c7667735aa54c174cb90c83107258ae4aa	B!|`|GfG4PfjMaa	I think it would depend upon the guy.  Some guy want an attachment and others don't mind being on the side lines.    Does he want to be someone who is taken seriously?    If it's all just fun and games, it's okay to be with both, depending upon the scene.    You didn't indicate the object of the flirtations  he may be in high demand, but if the flirting is being done with others then that may create a problem.    Based alone on the length of your descriptions, you seem to prefer the (B) personality, it was more detailed.    Something the way he is  treated ....and based upon all the things you have described about girl A and B, that for me would be the most important thing.      In any relationship I encounter, I always want to be treated as a  respected mate, friend or just someone special.    Sometimes the mysterious is a camouflage for a lack of substance.  Once you get past the mask what else is there?|`|fPd7Pva5aa	C) the girl i'm already with.|`|zGid9wJBaa	B)   (maybe)|`|M50HMrBLaa	a girl that u can laugh, cry, and make memories with
NXwzuv3Paa	he definately brings out the worst. i was in a perfectly great mood this morning when i woke. he was still in the bed. i let him sleep. i got up with the kids. yeah im a stay at home mom for 5 years, just went back to work 2 days ago. anyway he got up in a very bad mood. he was hollering at every body. i told him to change his attitude. we all no where that ended up. had to go out of town on a 2 hour trip to take 6 year old to doctor. it was the worst day ever just because he was with me. and most of the time i dont even care if he doesnt come home from work at night. its better for him to work 12 hours a day.|`|g6Lz8bFUaa	It takes time for everything to get in it's place in a marriage.   at first they'll do things that irritate you but through communication ( talking not bitching) you will get through it.|`|YDBpaNPzaa	There has been times that my spouse was really hard to deal with and really crossed lines that capable of bringing out the worst in me I have even felt as if that's what he was trying to do, in order to not have to admit the truth in some cases. When, I felt that happening instead of letting his action's control my reactions that were leading to bringing out my worst in me, I just did not allow it, I may not have been in a great mood, but I refused to lose control of me based on what he was or was not doing too me or whatever the case.   Eventually, he began bringing out the best in me more and more I guess because by not allowing him to bring out my worst it started to bring out his best. Lead by example|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Both.  But mostly the best.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	95% of time the best  5% of the time the worst :( :(    Overall marriage is the best thing ever invented.|`|AA10886262	if you have married the right person, they will bring out the best in you....and laugh when you are down and laugh when you are happy...|`|IvMPh09baa	Yes... sure it is a reason.  But actually lately he brings out the worst in me.  I can't even talk to him anymore, he is always drunk and so the only thing in my mind is to yell at him or tell him to sober up.  I'm so angry inside at him, it shows by the way I get angry with him all the time.  You try being married to a man thats constantly drunk, and only comes home to finish his drinking for the night and then just sleep.  Thats all the man does. work, drink, sleep... nice life.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Both! No such thing as a 100% perfect relationship remember? I just wish my wife could have much more things in common with me, because it really sucks, in that you cannot be able to share your full happiness in life with your spouse. So I basically drink alone, cookout alone, go to the movies alone and have fun alone. My wife absolutely does not enjoy the same things out of life in general. So every time I run into another female friend, that enjoys the same things as me, I get extreme happy temporarily. For better or worse right?|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I think the words your looking for is emotional support. Husbands and wives should support each other. When 1 is down, the other suppose to lift their spirits up. When one is up, the other should take notice, and try to keep it that well. When dating everyone has on their best face. When you are married the real face are on. I guess you see the good, the bad, and the ugly when you marry someone. But that's a good thing to me. Because things are never going to be always good. Marriage is still better than being single. Because someone is there during those times, maybe not as supportive as people would like, but some or little support beats no support any day.|`|AA11449143	Well I guess that would depend on what day it is. I think as long as the good out weighs the bad then everything is peachy.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	My wife brings out the best in me.|`|dprURFLxaa	Both.  Totally both.  Sometimes he brings out the best in me and sometimes he brings out the worst in me.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	If the marriage is good, it is both!  You cannot have true intimacy with just the best showing, you have to experience the worst as well... hence the phrase "for better or for worse".  The key is to work WITH each other so the worst gets better and the best gets 'bester'!    Unconditional love means you want the good and the bad, the whole package.    Because no one is closer to me than my wife, no one can make my heart sore like her, and no disappointments hurt more than with her.  But if you expect to find the perfect spouse who will never let you know, you expect too much!    Hope that helps.|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	both.  i react to him on an extreme in both directions.  when it's good it's good, and when it's bad it's bad...i've never been that way with anyone else.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	My spouse actually brings out the worst in me, sadly.   But our marriage has been over for awhile now. I am considering a divorce now.   I can't remember the last time he told he he loved me or that I was beautiful or looked nice or asked me how my day was. He's always negative, upset with me about something and never meets me halfway on anything.|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	Both .    If she is trying to dominate me , then the crap hits the fan .    If she is open minded and nice to me then yes .

QzokuJVsaa	I think I have an answer about what NOT to do on a first date! Just saw a sorta funny dating video about the stuff in your house that makes dates want to leave here: http://lisadaily.com/datingexperttv/2008...        Video has Lisa Daily, who wrote HOW TO DATE LIKE A GROWN-UP (and another dating book, I think, STOP GETTING DUMPED.)|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Be yourself.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	I usually don't try and impress her too much.

Not somebody I am not.|`|N8kxg8wgaa	show them your genitalia|`|LyFaBLSJaa	i dont know it depends who the person is, but i would definately try to do something off the wall in a good way, something that just lets us both have fun.|`|HQKuzxulaa	Nothing at all. Anyone could tell from miles away that you were trying to impress. Don't pretend to be something you are not.|`|t6wid9xaaa	You can Impress in several ways, Good Impression...  Look secure, listen to what he/sehe have to say, Don't start sex talking etc etc... Bad impressions... Get Drunk in middle of dinner, Start saying sex jokes, talking about how good your ex-girlfriends where etc..    Depends on what you want 
reCrzbPEaa	Different women are looking for different things. After 40 we've got history and in theory we try to learn from what worked and what didn't work in the past. It depends a lot on what sort of relationship a woman is looking for too.    Personally, personality and how a man deals with stressful situations is a real test for me. I'm pretty flaky as a person, high energy and I can be all over the place. So the men who catch my attention don't mind that and let me have my mini-dramas without taking it personally or trying to change the way my brain functions.

AA11659150	Be proud of yourself for learning another language.  It takes a long, long, long time to truly become fluent in a new language.  And when I say that, I mean the "colloquillisms" (slang!) in particular.      If he gets annoyed, that is more his problem than yours.  My hope would be that he would simply correct you (positively) and that you can giggle away the mistake and keep learning.      My dad's girlfriend is from China and she and her son both learned English when they came here.  They get better every single year, but there are still some slang phrases that they mix up.  It's more amusing than anything, but certainly nothing to be embarrassed about.  They laugh about it too.      Don't let him make you feel inferior (less than him).  I bet he can't speak your language!!!!  It takes smarts to learn a new language and if he can't appreciate it, I am sure you will find a nice english speaking guy who has no problem with it.  And don't worry about the accent.  It will fade some with time, but is part of your heritage and something for you to be proud of.      Go girl and be proud of yourself.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	My partner came here to Britain from Poland via a time in Berlin in Germany and she spoke not a word of English and i spoke no Polish and only a little German but we managed to communicate and had a few laughs on the way.My father lived here for 30 years coming to Britain from Poland with the Polish navy during WW2 and he died with his Polish accent.My mother was first attracted to him by his accent so be proud of your national heritage and stand tall|`|Fh76mMuUaa	awww i love accents... just learn our slangg or ask other ppl...|`|51Q5uvpKaa	just ask him you are dating, so you can talk about this kind of stuff with him.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	you shouldnt do anything. you are who you are, if he gets annoyed because of your accent then hes ignorant & immature. hopefully he'll grow out of that with time.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	I think accents are the sexiest thing ever!    Take your time to get to know your boyfriend, as well as the new culture you are in. It's totally natural that you will not understand all the slang and if your boyfriend really cares about you as a person he will be understanding of that.    In a couple years you will be so acclimated to this country that you won't feel this way. But for now be patient with yourself and proud of all you have experienced. Different cultures are beautiful. Just remember when you feel down that you have a ton of knowledge about a life completely different than the one here, a life many of the kids you go to school with would feel lost in.    So relax and enjoy your new life. My mom moved here when she was 25 and 35 years later she still has an accent and says some things differently. I think it is the cutest most charming thing ever. And a man that cares for you will too.    Good Luck and Welcome!|`|eug6CIMZaa	No! Girls from Norway are gorgeous, and I'm sure youre accent is equally attractive. Don't be self concious, he's dating oyu for a reason|`|LP41U9djaa	I find accents pretty cute, but that's just me.    I don't think many people understand a lot of the slang that comes out of their mouth. It's not big deal really, it just means you'll be asking "What does that mean?" so often if you don't understand something. Doesn't everyone do that?    You're his girlfriend. That means he accepts you for who you are, and has been doing that for several years already. Don't worry about it.
XRn0Ai3Naa	Well i just got a new job and i live with my grandma. My grandma raised me my whole life and i thank her  for that everyday. So when i get paid she will be getting half my check.|`|mULJMC0waa	Ask your parent's if you can help out by paying some of their bills. If you really want your parent to have part of your pay check ask them what they want. They will give you the best answer. Do not force it on them if they want none of it. I like your attitude on this. It is very nice of you to give back to your parents.|`|mxrlZEweaa	0% but I will take care of my mom when she is longer able to care for herself. She is 72 and still works, volunteers at her church, and is part of the women's club. So I think she is going to be around for a while. I think different parts of the world treat their parents differently though.|`|uBssj3Znaa	None of it does. It all goes to bills, food and whatever I need.
MWjNp6y3aa	I want to see a girl and I am with a girl already. Maybe they are friends and he doesn't want you to freak out on him for seeing a friend. But maybe he wants to get frisky with a woman that can't chase him back home.     I told my woman though. I tell her all things. Even though it pisses her off at least she knows I won't lie and withhold something. That and she knows I love her and am not going to leave her.     Everyone is different though. I do think it is because of that woman though. That is how we think. Unless he has family or something there.  Just tell him if he is seeing this female friend you want to know. Let him know that if he is honest you won't freak out on him. If he tells you he is then don't freak out on him. Love him and just see what happens. He will be more honest with you if you don't freak out on him. Once you freak though he will hide everything. I know I would.|`|nr1Bt47baa	Good chance he is going to see her. No one just goes to Cali to be alone. Don't be stupid he is up to something. Your not in the wrong to think that.
sXT86Swqaa	Usually if a guy is serious when he says this then he will forget about her. . . . but not right away. So if you like him you better make your move quickly!|`|ykH93Wyxaa	if he doesnt really like her no more then i guess he means it you girls cant chop and change your minds an expect the guy to just wait around|`|2mlHf7Opaa	Too bad.  You waited too long.  You lost your chance.
5N1rEjiqaa	If she loves you she will swallow  If she respects you she will spit in the sink and not on the floor
wFN8bVqsaa	I just went through that same thing. My bf was hell-bent on trying to not admit that he was in love with me, even though it was SOOO obvious to everyone. It turned out that he was really hurt in the past and didn't want to fall in love because it made him suffer in the past. He thought that love was hard and adding it into a relationship just makes it harder. It just takes time for that person to start trusting you and realizing that love is not such a sacrifice. I agree with you that some people are just so apprehensive. It's certainly frustrating for those of us who WANT to be in love!|`|Fh76mMuUaa	no maybe theyve gotten hurt before..   or its kind of hard to just throw yourslef at someone else. i know i wont hurt my bf but its hard for me to believethat when hes with his "boys" he wont screw up at hurt me.|`|ark4Psqjaa	got beer|`|QdIwuRRVaa	if a girl has been hurt before of course it will be hard to give your whole self to a person if you dont yet trust them. give her time and make sure you tell her how much you care and that you wont hurt her and make sure you dont ! if you know your gonna cause her more pain stop the relationship now. but if you can give her love and make her feel like shes the most important person than she will eventually let her walls down and trust you|`|Q1MI6L96aa	There is a trust factor that some people may have a problem in overcoming....for whatever reason - and there are many, the individual may be waiting to have the significant other end the relationship, so it's not worth getting "fully committed.|`|ruczpWrGaa	it goes back to if it seems too good to be true it probably is.  Im the same what with my boyfriend and he is the same way with me.  We are both so completely amazed by each other.|`|O6JhEjEQaa	It sounds like you have someone who was hurt before or maybe has never been in a relationship.. You can only work on their own trust with you, depending on how bad it was it may take a lot of time. =[|`|oMXlbWu9aa	Low self esteem|`|A65C8cmeaa	Once you have gotten hurt before by someone you love trusting again can be extremely hard. You can never know for a fact that someone loves you, there are no guaranties that you won't get hurt. Someone promising doesn't mean anything that ain't a promise that can be 100% keep. For some people it is a self-esteem thing. It's hard for some people and it sucks that people get upset because they don't understand how you feel.
sgSOmU75aa	Hmm. Have you ever read any romance novels or saw any romance movies where there are sparks from the start? You know, when the guy refrains the girl from meeting somewhere or where he randomly shows up from behind? Yep, I would love to be approached like that. Or, for humor's sake, it would be amazing to carry on a conversation chock full of double entendres. Innocent? Maybe yes, maybe no. It lets your mind "go there."
IgivEx1Vaa	Of course you should
AA10886262	send the card, keep offering the olive branch, call her and make lunch plans|`|faOBk7qtaa	Cards are worthless and a very weak form of appreciation and or happiness. They are very impersonal, unless maybe you write your own card and design the picture yourself.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Write her a letter, and say pretty much what you typed here, especially the part that says you would love to have your children be friends one day, you both now have another common interest, motherhood.    When you send your letter, let her know that you would like to follow up with brunch on you, suggest a date within two weeks of the letter, if she doenst respond, maybe let it go for awhile, its possible she isn't ready to reconcile, or shes got a plateful at home.|`|iD4ejChZaa	a well chosen card is not worthless, cards mean a lot to people like me [do not put any letter in it].  If she isn't interested; forget it~. However after the novelty of having a new baby wears off, towards the summer you might want to try again, but if it were me I wouldn't bother.|`|g6Lz8bFUaa	Send her a birthday card with a picture of your new family and include a letter of how you feel and you were hoping you can start over again and see if she replies................................  hope you the best of luck|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I would let her go honestly.  She doesn't sound like a true friend.  Just move on, don't send a card.  Sometimes people simply outgrow each other, it's OK to let go.|`|TLNQZ63baa	Just send a nice gift. Semi-expensive from Dillards or Macy's and a congrats note.  Something thoughtful. Tell her in the note, that you wish her the best and let you know if she needs anything. You'd love to talk again and you'd love to take her to lunch soon.  Nothing more.  If she does not respond, it is over.
4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	You can't get in contact with your fiance? There's something fishy going on there.    Either call another family member or go see him.    If you guys are planning to spend the rest of your lives together you need to communicate with one another.    There's something going on and you need to get to the bottom of it.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	um yes, that's too long to go without hearing from him.  is there a chance he was in an accident?  or is he just avoiding you and yucking up with his boyz?  either way, if you show up he'll know how concerned you were about him and hopefully he won't go MIA again, idiot.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Don't call him.    If there's a problem his brother will contact you.  Otherwise, consider no news is good news.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	First find out what the problem is! Then go with your gut and mines is telling me no.  If there was some sort of emergency, I feel like since your his fiance someone would've called like they have before.|`|FnskUYpqaa	No don't call. I can tell your probably worried but my mom always says bad news travels faster than good.So you would have heard from someone by now. Don't call him.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Dump him, he is too much of a coward to tell you he does not want to get married and he is avoiding you.|`|Muoe8lQtaa	What? Why?  i really don't understand but i say Yea definitely go see him you guys are about to get married soon.  (just as long as its not right before the wedding then your good.)|`|wpyoYVaIaa	why get married if he's not going to be there?|`|bCklOKbraa	I think you should go make a visit. He has no reason to not talk to you for that long esp because your his fiance. Good luck!! :)|`|0fab88920598e3eab212bb2e9c15a33caa	I saw where you posted this a few days ago.   But my advice to you is:  STOP CALLING! My fianc is overseas right now and Ive been with him almost 4 years now, and I have gone through with what you are going through more than I can count.  First of all, have you been the initiator when it comes to calling all the time or trying to fix issues with you two?  If that is so and he isnt cheating, then he has just gotten use to you making the first move. He has become comfortable and content. You have made yourself too available and you are being TOO PREDICTABLE and you need to find you some businessmeaning go hang out with family or friends, get your hair, nail and feet done, go out of town(not where he is), or find something else to do that will take your mind off of it.  He could be very well going through some things or he may very well be acting like a coward.  All relationships are different and every individual is different on how they handle issues in their life.  You're going to have to just be patient and when he does call you then you let him know how you feel but only using "I" statements and not "you" this and "you" that.  And listen to him as well because you just don't know. You have to know how to turn the tables a bit.  Is it fair that you are left to worry?  NO, it isnt fair and I know how you feel but you have to continue to live your life.  As the saying goes, "If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it`s yours. If it doesn`t, it never was."     I could go on and on and on about how I finally learned my lesson.  But the end reward is that I'm having a good time and finding out more about myself and he is changing his ways.
3tHTZ2lKaa	just have fun with it too!  enjoy all you can with her!  good luck!  best wishes for you two!  member; live life!

mt3Af2FYaa	It depends on his preference. Some white guys only date white girls, some only date black girls, some Asians and so on. It just depends. Some guys don't care.     For example i am a white girl (very white LOL) i am simply not attracted to black men. Not sure why nothing against them they just don't "do it for me". Men are the same way its just a matter of what they are attracted to. What their type is. :D Hope that helps.|`|62d419570572377e88e6cca8cc106a30aa	I see it all the time.|`|t2lRE8xOaa	it would depend on the guy, i mean you said yourself you 'only date white guys'|`|TOei73dbaa	White guys would but mostly we don't because the other races (not meant as a slur or anything, sorry if it does) Don't seem to understand us as well. Usually it is easier to understand the opposite sex of your own race simply because like races think the same|`|u4NXQkq7aa	sure they do i would my friend has a blk wife men and woman date out side there race mutthead243@yahoo|`|nr1Bt47baa	I would, some might not. What inside is what matters but you are a very beautiful woman though. I think some white guys might just be afraid. Good luck.|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	Black guys have bigger diks than white folks|`|eqWftUQeaa	It all depends on the guy|`|0HO8sTGeaa	why not.... love is blind , O_o|`|mfhgQoNUaa	Some guys may not date outside their race but those guys aren't worth your time anyway.  Their is no reason to not date someone other than the person you have feelings for and race shouldn't be the issue.  Although sometimes people often date within their race it is due to the people they meet and sometime old fashioned social expectations but it doesn't mean they wouldn't consider a person of a different race.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	Me never|`|V5akMpDAaa	the ones in alabama do(:|`|IuW9zgYcaa	if they aint racist.. ye corse they will lol|`|dvLqREZcaa	not this white guy|`|AA10409800	I'm sure in the entire history of the human race this has never happened.    Great in-depth inquiry there.|`|oDqQ9n7Iaa	u r looking at the wrong guys...why do you only date white guys??|`|9CCXPGXqaa	yes i see it all the time here!  My neighbor actually all he ever dated was black girls and he has kids that are half n half.  its funny his son is 6 and calls himself cappuccino;)|`|YvjTJPEfaa	White guys do date outside of there race, in fact do enough goggling and you'll see the crazy ones go as far as to date outside there species.|`|VOYSmwOXaa	why not?:)|`|Sv62SsxXaa	i live in a area that has a lot of white, black, puerto rican, dominican, and asian people.    ive seen white guys with them all.    it depends on where you live, how much of a "selection" there is. if the man grew up around a lot of cultures, most likely he'd be attracted to more then just the white girls.|`|LGHMmRVFaa	that does not matter are you rasist to your own race?|`|dJc7kTwUaa	well maybe some black and white people married it could be possible|`|yyIVrngcaa	Yea, no One likes to have the same thing all over again, curiosity gets the best of us.|`|rB8jM04Laa	thats a crazy *** question! why wouldnt they ?|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	It's funny you mention that. I live in a college town and I see a lot more black woman/white man relationships. And they don't suffer from the same stereotypes that a black man/white woman relationship does.|`|2pq3y2ghaa	Yes they do.|`|7ouqu8f4aa	I've seen and known, a lot of white guys dating black girls.|`|AA11355552	yes it is quite common for a white guy or any guy to date ouside his race.  My niece is 1/2 black and she is married to a white guy.  Also I have to brothers (white) Who married Indian and Brazillian, so yes a white guy would and does date outside his race all the time.|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	it depends on the guy. everyone is atracted to different things. so some white guys may not be attracted to other races, but then again, some might. it's just what that individual is attracted to.|`|JCdBSULraa	I know a few white guys who married black women, as well as a handful of half-black women I've known and would like to have dated.   It does happen.   I will say I'm not entirely attracted to fully-black women, as the ones around here are almost always morbidly obese.|`|fKedbYR4aa	Well, It's more common for white men to date white women. As it is more common for a Black man to date a black woman. Honestly, I know a lot of people who have dated outside of their race. There really isn't a problem with it. Mostly it just lies within what their parents have instructed them to do in the past. If a parent teaches them to date within their own race, they will most likely do it because they think that their parents will be upset about it. Some people just do it anyway. It's hard to say. But Yeah, a white guy has no problem dating outside his race, if he's been taught right. By that I mean, "be with whoever makes you happy"|`|GYlkTlMHaa	Absolutely; I've dated f girls of every race and find them all very pleasant. Guess I'm colour blind!|`|hq0VAXDbaa	personally, no, but thats judging by all of the people not my coulour, or not my race that ive met over my years of living so i could be swayed. if the girl was nice anough and pretty enough then yeh but becuase of their coulor or race then i think that the prettyness instantly goes down and so does you piont of biew of their personality, so its a hard one. but there are lots of white guys out there that would date or even marry people of differant coulor and race.    unfortunatly we are still a races nation, although we like to call ourselves otherwise, we arnt its the way were brought up and our parrants and there parents were races but as we go on we will become more acceptive and less races to a piont were it doesnt matter what race you are or what coulor you are, but till then, naaa
jtjISk6qaa	my mom left my dad cause he cheated on her. now i have a half sister whos 2. i mean shes my sister, too. just like my other one. my dads "girlfriend" isnt my stepmother and i still resent her.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I was never in that situation so its hard for me to think of how I would feel, especially as a kid with so many questions as to why.  But Im guessing I would come around if my father was still a huge part of my life but not if he was an "every other weekender". No way.|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	I would judge them on how they act and how they treat me .    Everything else is unimportant .|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No|`|mKmrfeX7aa	Never.|`|VOYSmwOXaa	Unless they are mean to you yeah you hate them,but if they are nice and care for no don't hate them!|`|3SWjKcAEaa	I would not love them as "my own" but may possibly like them as step brothers/sisters. I would probably think of them as cousins or something. But that is only if they are likable people. If not, then don't even bother.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Yeah absolutely! It's not their fault that your father, left your mom and started a new family. They are still your family too. Don't blame the kids or your step mother for his decision. I can see not agreeing with your father for leaving your mom. But whatever makes him happy.|`|Mf78vvLbaa	No. Its not the children's fault that they got caught up in it. As far as your step mother goes, just try and keep the peace....again, its not their fault. Your father made a choice, and one that cannot be changed. Take this time and make some peace and forgive your father for what has happened in your life. Im sorry that you have to go through this, but make the best out of the situation. Love your siblings as your own. Life is short....too short to be hating one another. Seriously find some inner peace within. I suggest you talk to your dad about how you feel. Its probably time that he apologize to you for what has happened, but then you must move on and be happy.|`|rvviZvOSaa	Yeah, it's not their fault but anyways..things change, people change. Everybody's right, it depends on how they treat you, how much you communicate and share interests and feelings..Maybe they're in the same situation.|`|mULJMC0waa	You should not have a problem with your family. They are half related to you. You need to keep your friends close and your family closer. Your dad left your mom for a reason that is for your parent's to fight about. You as kids will need to accept your father the way he is. He may not be the best guy in the world but you are his children. You don't have to accept what he did was right but you need to be a part of your dad's life. As far as his kids I hope you can accept them they were brought into this world by another relationship. If they are around at christmas and holidays at least try to accept them. This divorce affect more then just the imediate family. If affects your grandparent that love to see grand children. I know they will miss their chances to see you. It also affect relatives also. In the same way as the grandparents. I hope you can accept your dad and your half brothers and sisters.|`|M50HMrBLaa	i wouldn't cosider them family but more like friends if we got along|`|ft8t98Pnaa	yes I would love them....(and I do)... It depends on how my step mom treated me... if she was a ***** to me and treated me like an outsider.. then no I wouldnt.. if she treated me like one of her own.. then yes I would love her.|`|O2VZL8Praa	it isn't the kid's fault.  who knows?  you might like them.      hate is like taking poison and expecting the other guy to die.  make the best of your life.  it won't last forever.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	I would still love them. Though, the step mother..not as much.    I have half brothers, and they mean the world to me.
AA11273149	you are obviously too young to realize this right now, but here is a little advice:    Like yourself first, everything else will fall into place. I can pick out the woman that feels good about herself by the way she glows and looks, not by her size. Any happy confident woman is attractive and sexy, but then i am a lot older and wiser now also.     Relax, focus on what makes you happy and don't try to please someone to make them like you, it will make you ugly.|`|u4NXQkq7aa	ok guys like girls for many reasons i myself like a little meat with my potatoes but that doesnt mean i wouldnt date a skinny girl either if ur nice sweet caring t6hose are things i look for some guys want the throphy but personally the trophy cums with lots of headaches so i would say u will find the right guy that u share a lot with stop looking and he will fall in ur arms|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I'm a size 12/14 and I'm curious too even though I'm married and my husband says I'm sexy.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	guys dont like fat chicks     1 is the face|`|JfsVqoiDaa	Unfortunately we live in a world and time where appearances are very important. It's the cold hard truth and I'm not afraid to say that it's true in my case as well. I am not gonna pretend and say that personality is all that matters and don't get me wrong personality is very important as well, but guys will most likely go for the size 0. It's in our nature. Sorry for such honesty but I hope it helps.|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Take care of yourself.  Work with what you've got and do try to lose a little weight.  Nothing is a bigger turn off than a girl who is a little big and doesn't take care of her face, make-up, hair etc.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	My ex wife was a size 16 when we first met.  I remember because it was my color size.  Some guys like the more fuller girls.  My son is one of them (he's 28).  The things that guys your age looks for in a girl is how easy she is.  Most guys your age mostly want one thing.  I say let them wait.  You have your whole life ahead of you. No need to settle for the guys your age just yet.  You still have what they call "baby fat" and you're going to lose it before long.  My wife now was pretty small when we met in college and I was dearly in love with her but she had to move to another state to finish her degree.  22 years later she came back and found me and she's twice as wide as she was when we met.  2 children will do that to some women, but I still love her.  As guys get older their likes change and size has only a little to do with how they feel about girls.    Hope this helps.|`|6QLlaONDaa	swettie, curvy is someone like Kim Kardashian ( altoughidk she's famous) Beyonce, etc.    someone who is a size 16 is PLUS SIZE... and guys like who they like... to each their own  they are some ppl ( myself included) that arent a size 5, but still look decent and presentable.....|`|YyFexhd3aa	i like curves alot but sure not size 16 it will be fat ....the main thing is the face of course if its pretty we look at the rest of the body|`|CAAcoqtYaa	I got attracted with my girl friend on the way she acted. She acted so mature and smart at times.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	Not no but hell no|`|edIUAbCxaa	it depends on the guy. when i look for a girl, i look at their face. and then next is their body, boobs, butt...etc...|`|IzHkb1neaa	my husband said, it doesn't matter size. It matters about personality.|`|8bb58fa4a42dc6a54ae5600a0d408c42aa	I have to admit I have no idea what a size 16 is, but with that being said I think most guys like curves. Most of us don't realize it, but a confident woman is one of the most attractive things. If you are comfortable with who you are, guys will pick up on it...|`|AA11309717	personally I like curvy women. I think that what's inside of a women is more important than what's on the outside.    I have dated women who were very pretty but when I got to know them I found out that the pretty I saw on the outside wasn't reflected on the inside. I have dated women who altho weren't pretty on the outside  became prettier  to me as I got to know who they really were.    Just know that being who you are is the best you can do. No matter who you are you aren't going to appeal to everybody.    My wife is a size 16 and trust me I love all of her curves just as I would love all the curves if she were a size 6.    Good luck and stay beautiful!|`|3cdd2992b76ad47f7bbe388c40089b65aa	just tell yourself that there is more of you to love.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I don't want to be with a wale that will crush me if she sits on my knee.|`|wQEdey24aa	Im not a guy...but LOVE YOURSELF. I know lots of guys who think confidence is the sexiest thing about a girl....if u show confidence and walk wih your head held high, guys will automatically be attracted to you. And anyways the right guy wont even care about ur dress size :-)|`|dYYD4ibGaa	This question is impossible to answer  -  it is like saying what do women like about men....come on.  Everyone likes different things in people....take a chance and ask him - if he rejects you - move on to the next one.....|`|OLbo7Fvxaa	Personally, I prefer women of medium to medium large weights (not sure what that is in sizes) they simply look healthier to me.    statistically speaking, most men are physically attracted to a women with curves. find what you can do to be healthy, and there will be many men who will find you beautiful in that way.    As a note of personal advice, All of the (mature) men I know, myself included, disregard appearance when looking for a partner. personality is far more important to a long term relationship.    *edit: Ignore anyone calling you fat or ugly completely. The people who matter won't mind, and the people who mind won't matter.|`|nW7LZH6Aaa	Hey, the other dudes got a point, propper fat chicks are not cool! But seriously me and all my mates like girls who are thin, yeah, but also ones who are curvy, sometimes thats really attractive! Looks aren't everything, but the no.1 thing in my opinion is a nice smile. There is nothing worse that a pretty girl who's expression is just cold! Give me the average smiling girl every time! You might not think this make a big difference but trust me it does! If your kind, dress nicely smile and look natural guys will like you, even if they don't show it! Sometimes the best thing to do is if you start a conversation with a guy, cos remember its as hard for us, if not worse! c ;-)|`|PTgJKcexaa	I am a guy and I do care if your hot or not but I like the personality of girls and I love the girls who and play sports and not the ones who spend all day in front of the mirror.  I also like girls when they come to me and ask me because guys hate it when they get turned down  and the guy will think it will be nice and you will be a lot more likely to say YES.    IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU ARE  If your worried about your size just do a workout thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TWViaqN2aa	It doesn't matter to anybody excepet you. And whoever loves you. i THINK YOU LOOK SEXY.
qjg0g5WMaa	well was it a spelling exam,cause its obvious to me you should have studied harder then you need to get your priorities set right  cause obviously you need your education worse than you need some immature teenage crush|`|hXQjnPuGaa	A person who loves you wouldn't expect you to sacrifice your education to hang out with them.    A person who loves you would encourage you to learn things like grammar and spelling, so that you're able earn the respect you deserve.    I'm sorry, but it's true.|`|7ouqu8f4aa	Unless their was a very good reason for me to miss my exam, I wouldn't have.    Spending time with your other half is important, but not as important and finishing out your education. You need to focus on yourself and your schooling so your future with the person you love will be more gratifying in the end.     Otherwise your pretty much setting yourself up for failure.|`|DJwRCAFpaa	first off learn the english language  and then learn how to enter it on a keyboard.    and you should worry about passing school a little bit more because if they loved you then they would want to see you fail at anything|`|KOSuw0Bkaa	It means that she/he doesn't have any fear about their future(who never thinks abt how to earn money and lead a happy life).They may enjoy now but lately they will know about their shattered dreams!!!|`|198GMFVRaa	Dear never let yourself fail that exam. Because love might come and go in your life, but that education will be yours forever. I made that mistake in life and I have repented on it so badly. The person you love should also support you in passing your exams and getting a good education.    Good luck!
tL2U34kraa	because you are probably passive or a push over and let them, unfortunately  going to people after it occurs its a little late, there is not much they can do.stand your ground don't let people walk over you but be smart about it too,like don't get into fights and jeopardize your grades for it but do stand your ground.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why do you think no one hates you?|`|AA11878029	what is an example of people stepping All over you?  You may just be having a bad day and your hormones are out of whack    I am sorry you have to go through this.  Girls can be cruel.  hang in there and stand tall.  Try talking to the school counselor.  The counselor may give you a special pass to leave the school half hour early and half hour late in the morning to avoid being alone with these girls.   Have your mom push the school to receive this pass.  The less the mean girls see you the less your under stress and they might just forget about you.  Do not brag about this pass.  Be discreet otherwise others kids will use this special privilege in the wrong way|`|EjyD1sXeaa	when people treat you like cr4p it is because they have HUGE insecurities themselves and want you to feel as bad as them - do not let them take away your self-esteem, rise above it and love yourself. Remember that you are better than them|`|kBSlNEL2aa	I'm sorry girls are giving you a hard time.  The only solution is to fight back or ignore them.  I suggest ignoring them, it's simpler that way.  All of this drama that you girls stir up will all be over once you graduate and go into the real world.  So don't stress over it too much.  Hope this helped and hope you feel better soon...|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well: you know this is "Friends and that would be very important  thing with Family & Relationships they can help you all ways   as parents and my friendships together should be stronger "|`|KBUcBaXgaa	And with this you wanted?|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Don't be a doormat anymore. Put your foot down. Call people on there crap.|`|03GQ637Raa	Instead of going to ur mom, tell Dad what is going on and he can probably put a handle on it.  If Dad is not around, well tell a little fib and tell the jerk to stop messing with u cause your Dad is gonna get it right.|`|rMrcsjxpaa	You shouldn't hate yourself. Why do you think they treat you poorly? Step in their shoes and figure out. Do you wear different clothes, are you a different race, etc? Just be who you really are deep down, and be proud of it. They will get the point. If you cry and hate yourself do you think people will respect you? Obviously not. Be helpful, respectful, not a goody goody, and go with the flow. Don't try to stand out. Eventually, people will know who you are-a strong, proud girl who won't give up, and they will really respect you. If you would like more advice, you're always welcome to e-mail me.|`|NQ97Q1gkaa	Don't listen to others or their opinion if its negative,its more about yourself and building self esteem,if someone sees you are confident and comfortable in your own skin they wont mess with you,youdon'tt have to be rude or anything,just by having boundaries.    Like with a guy if he does something youdon'tt like and you think its really bad just stop talking to them,and let them know how much you respect yourself.    Trust me i know because i was bullied in school from elementary thru high school,but now im more comfortable with myself and people see it,i just wished i had learned this earlier,good luck and don't worry ;)
pHD6ZdmPaa	well there is nice shy girls every where just  give it time and look around..|`|TEpJLVAnaa	go to a hospital the depression ward!!!|`|s19Lbjifaa	they are everywhere. i wondered where i would find a nice guy since majority are jerks but i found one.|`|zIoWCX7vaa	LOOK NO FURTHER :)|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Ashley is right dude. Keep ur eyes open.
x02jsjg6aa	No, they have their difficulties.  Relationships are difficult because people are still from different "planets," even if they are of the same gender.|`|satoCRC6aa	relationships are work no matter whom they are between.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I don't know how two women could live together for a long time.    To counter your 'different planets' hypothesis, I submit 'opposites attract'.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	No.    ALL relationshps require work.|`|h7xh61TWaa	No. Not even close.    Man is made to be with a woman, not another man. That's why if everyone was homosexual we would slowly die out into extinction.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus is a bunch a bull.  We're all from Earth.    Ask me about my feelings on "He's Just Not That Into You".  I'll tell you anyway, maybe *you* are just not that into *him*.  Ever think of that?    I love teh gays.    End rant.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Nope.    People forget that the whole, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus thing....works!    They are complimentary opposites. They are as different as peanut butter and jelly, but go together just as easily.    You will note that even amongst gay couples, one naturally gravitates towards masculinity, and the other towards femininity. Far from being two bros or two sisters....most gay couples are spreading themselves thin trying to cover all the bases, forcing themselves into mixed gender roles.     Our problem today is, we've eliminated our recognition of what make men and women different. We speak of equality as one speaks of two halves of a pie, rather than a plug and an outlet (different entirely in design, yet complimentary).     All this redefinition has been causing havoc with our society for the last forty years. We can only hope it's coming to a speedy conclusion.     Good Luck!|`|4V3LVIc4aa	i think all relationships no matter what kind they r have the same chances. i have dated both men and women and i ended but in love with a man and we r happy. so i dont really think it matters.|`|g6Lz8bFUaa	It doesn't matter what type of relationship you are in you will have the same problems. It is the person you find that will make it work or not.|`|yy45iAbtaa	a relationship is a relationship weather between a man and a man or a woman and a woman or man and woman.they all end up being the same if you have respect honesty love and forgiveness.then you have a certain kind of relationship that will last if you do not have those qualities in the relationship it will fail whomever you are with.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Nope, Even if you have the same genitals - you still aren't a mind reader and will face the same problems as everyone else.
70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	Do you mean High School Diploma? No, its never too late to learn. This would benefit you greatly as you'll find better jobs. Then you can go on to college and earn a certificate or degree. My mom is 61 and she never graduated from high school so you're not that bad off.|`|NLxcfGplaa	Whats HS??   high school??|`|7sxGW40qaa	What is an HS?|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't know if you mean high school diploma or not, but if that is what you are talking about then I say no way! At least you completed it and that gets 1000 kudos from me. You should be mucho proud of yourself and remember age is nothing but a number.  Have a good day.|`|8QZBLRhaaa	no
OG4410bdaa	wow    well- do you have a tv show you might both enjoy?  my husband and I watch LOST together, its a thought-provoking show so gives us alot of opportunity for new conversation    if you both participate in an activity together...  bowling? shooting darts? playing pool? card games? board games?  my husband and I enjoy an on-going tornament of card games...nothing like healthy competition to stimulate a relationship    honestly...if you're having to put this much thought into common-interests then that's a big sign that your relationship is abit too thought-out  the early stages of a relationship should really flow alittle bit easier with alittle less thought, plenty of time to complicate things later on down the road|`|OBCvewW2aa	Try not to be so mind numbingly boring.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Who says men/boys are not interested in cooking?  There are many famous male chefs out there.  You two might really enjoy creating a meal together.    How about working out or sports - any interest there?  You should be able to at least tell him about any of your interests - what he wants to participate in is up to him.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	My husband and I go hiking together, he really enjoys bar games and we have the set up at home so I learned darts, pool, shuffle board, we play other games - cards and dominoes. We both own handguns and go to the shooting range. He does yoga with me sometimes (hahaha...wicked funny to watch) sometimes he'll come shopping with me and we make a dy of it.    that sort of thing|`|zqNzzFPXaa	My boyfriend and I talk about everything.  Even if I am not interested in what he is talking about I still listen because he enjoys talking about it.  He does the same for me, so honestly, if your man really cares about you.  He should listen to what you have to say.  You should do the same for him as well.  Remember, you must have good conversation with your partner other wise farther down the road your relationship will be boring and to an end.  Good luck to you.|`|RGxqhxDdaa	Such a question shows that you are so concerned about what other people think. I mean, as an ordinary individual there is no benefit in bowing down to society... Share whatever interests you feel like sharing. Nobody can tell you what or what not to share.|`|A2ZWKTiMaa	You sound like a Great wife material! ;) My wife and I always take it easy and just talk about whatever happened on the day and at night we may discuss a random topic we found from the web and often we watch some shows together and we reflect up on those. Personally, i love things about computers and i love to find the most simple way to describe things of that sort to her and she was kind enough to listen and i do that too. so if you know what your bf's  interests are you could always break the tension or getting out of a bad moment by asking him about things he knows alot about. The game is try to know as much about your significant others as you can while finding a way to enjoy that process.    gl|`|TLNQZ63baa	If you want to start conversation (this goes with the fine art of small talk) talk about something in the other person's comfort zone.  Is he into martial arts? Cars? Dogs? What does he do for a living? Ask him about that. Educate yourself on the topic beforehand and ask intelligent questions.  Is he into dogs? Ask about a breed. Say your bff Trixie is thinking of getting a poodle or a Pit Bull, what are his thoughts.  Or is he into cars? Ask him what he thinks of the turbo engine or if Toyota is going downhill due to their economic collapse, etc.  Do some digging.    We don't want to hear all the gossip and how you're mad at Trixie cuz she said this and now you are not mad at her but her outfit made her look fat but you don't want to tell her cuz she won't be your bff anymore. We don't want to hear about your cycles and emotional meltdowns and complaints.  We want to hear about what you thought of the last playoff and the cars you think that you might see us in and so on.
ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Coffee shop... always my answer to a friends first date. Its trendy, fun, and without a lot of expectations.     Plus just sitting around talking together outside the work environment will give you time to find out more about him and whether you want to take it a step further.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	ask him to help u at your place ... to do some thing ..like change a light for you .. then ask him there .if he would like to be your b/f ok good luck.

People put pics on myspace for people to look at and comment and people give out their numbers to talk. I think that if she didn't want to talk to you she wouldn't have given you her number. So just text her already. Comment her pics. Do whatever you want dude.|`|bec16h7Taa	What's the problem? You've been talking to her for a while.|`|7RWDXr4gaa	u're THINKING of putting up comments/ txting?! dude! jus do it if u like her.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	I would comment some of her pics in a cute way like "Wow, this is a great picture!" or "Aw, you look really cute here!" Nothing gross or anything, but sweet! And maybe leave a happy thought just as a regular comment, and then text her and tell her she should check her myspace and put a winky face ;-). I think it'd be adorable. =)|`|lAQG15kdaa	no that's fine she will probably be happy|`|Sv62SsxXaa	normally guys do it to me within a week (comment my pictures), i would be shocked if it took four months & he claims to be interested. i think you should hop on that ;)|`|yYQuZgVkaa	you are not doing any thing wrong she would properly be happy at the nice gesture.|`|GhetCx0iaa	Well, you're not doing anything wrong. Just take things as they come. Don't plan ahead, don't worry. I hate when guys try too hard, it puts me off so much. And if you're going to comment her pics on myspace, comment only 1 of them. If you comment all of them its kinda weird.     Um also if you're gonna text her - leave her a little flirty msg like "hey babe". and if she doesnt reply DO NOT TEXT HER AGAIN AND DONT ASK HER IF SHE GOT UR TEXT. But she probably will reply, and 2nd, dont text her too often, let her think that ur busy and have other things going for you, but ur still kinda into her.      nila~~~~~~~(:|`|mN5qGww0aa	what are u waiting for man?she surely wouldnt mind if u put a friendly nice comment on her photos, and especially that u guys know each other for 4 months, and she gave u her phone number!so a comment wont hurt her now, would it?! trust me i had comments on my facebook from people i have never spoke with before:D so go ahead, and make ur comment as attractive as possible and get the girl ;)|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	I'm a guy. You 'could' do that. But I'd recommend that you don't comment on her pics, ever.     The only time you should comment on her pictures are if she comments on yours first.

3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	aw =(    If I were you and I was serious about my boyfriend, I'd talk to my boyfriend and tell him all this stuff. I'd ask him to approach the uncle and try to disarm him by apologizing for being rude. Maybe just say he was on edge meeting your fam for the first time. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, it actually was not a nice way to introduce himself, and although you might accept your bf as he is and understand him, he still has to answer for his mistakes.|`|HjPt0V8Eaa	just understand him. If thats his attitude then perhaps its better to keep a distance but not to far.|`|lpVRwLaUaa	it is good to go according to family members which makes them happy eventually its makes you also to live happpy
ifgzHzA3aa	Write individual thank you's for each person that gave you a gift (even if it was a group gift) and then you can hand deliver them, by putting in mailboxes, on desks to the person directly, etc.  You do not need to mail them.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no, if each of them gave you a gift, they each get a thank you card.  even if someone gives you a joint gift, give each person their own card. no need to mail them, just hand them to people.  and yes, do it asap but they should all be done at the same time.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I would put thank you cards in each person's mailbox at work.  It'll save you the trouble of trying to get their home addresses and each person will appreciate an individual thank you.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you got individual gifts and cards, you send out individual thank yous. You don't ask for home addresses. You hand-deliver them to their offices.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Make out a thank you card for each person. Then hand them out to each of them. :)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i was raised that no matter how often you see them, you always hand write thank yous, to the specific person who gave you the gift.  so even though its a bit more work, i still think it would be appropriate to hand write the thank yous to each of your coworkers.  if you wanted to save a stamp though perhaps you could come in a bit early and leave them on desks or in work mailboxes?|`|q8eue7CRaa	It's still a gift so they deserve the same type of courtesy. Definitely don't hand out cards at the office - that is not professional and will make a scene (especially if not everyone was invited). If they had a shower for you, wouldn't you already have their address if you're inviting them to the wedding? If it was a surprise shower for you and there was a large gift from everyone, you could do one general card. If everyone got separate gifts, they deserve separate thank yous, ideally mailed to their home.|`|swg3BhLXaa	I would suggest handing out the cards at work. Place them on each co-workers desk at a time when the office is a little quieter. You could go in early one day and place the cards before they all get there, or stay a little later one evening if it's important to you not to be seen doing it.
Fnsea1sMaa	i think that it's best if your kids aren't around. just because you don;t want them to interfere, and proposing is something that should only be between two people  so why not get a babysiter in for the kids,  take her on like a daytrip somewhere remote, like some mountains, or someplace that no one else will be.    then ask her :)    hope it goes great!|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I think it is great you want your children around, I personally would not want them there, so I can share the moment and let it linger with my man. If kids are around, it will only be for a minute, then your time is up, its back to tending to children. Thats just MO. Totally up to you tho. Take her to a park, picnic, nice dinner, boat ride, clean house spotless, have tons of candles going, depends on age of kids, could have them help clean, dress them up cute, stand in a line when she comes home....be creative!!! But do think about the moment, having kids there, alot of ppl would want them there, some wont!!!Good luck and congrats!!!
nr1Bt47baa	Not really. If it was someone I really wanted, I would do anything for them though.|`|ks2oieV0aa	I'm a girl but I bet they like a challenge  xox|`|sCr2iTczaa	Some boys are like that but honestly there is no point in fighting over anybody it is ridiculous. If i had to fight off all the girls that look at my man i would be on death row by now.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	No i like it nice and easy|`|CUUjvakpaa	if i really like her i would do anything|`|71yXXY3eaa	Yes.  Getting something by effort and by my own achievements makes the end result seem much more important and satisfying.  It is also a good topic to talk about later while married with the girl.  Such efforts also demonstrate to the girl how much I love her and how much I would be willing to do and to sacrifice in order to be with her.|`|sXT86Swqaa	Fight for her with another guy? No    Fight for her in the sense of she's playing hard to get? Sometimes, it depends on the girl.|`|wH2Ztocuaa	yer i got my arm broken for her    i no it is not a gd thing but it was worth it|`|aUZLy4dkaa	to a point but some girls take it to far and you just loose interest.  some times its nice for the girl to show some real signs shes interested other wise it just goes on and on and the boy just becomes a toy.|`|zvoErK4vaa	Only if I really like them. Otherwise it wouldn't be worth the trouble.|`|r2Omn9qKaa	if i liked a girl i would die for her because i want her to be safe|`|oS1TBzL6aa	If she's worth it and you win at the end.  I assume you mean jumping through the hoops she sets out and being persistent, rather than beating up some other guy because that just makes you look like a jerk unless there is an extremely good reason.  Anyway, fighting for a girl is a lot like a wrestling match, it really s*cks unless you're the one at the end of the match with your hand in the air, a girl is the same way it is terrible but if you "win" its worth it, if not you just had your *** handed to you for nothing.    Cheers,  A.T. Cunningham

Ne7X11O8aa	If this isn't love then what is?  Loving someone is wanting to be with them and doing things for them.  Now, I hope he does things for you and accept you for who you really are because if not, then a one-sided love is the most painful of all.
AuKKjaxaaa	She is not comfortable with her body and doesn't feel sexy in it.    She thinks when you shop for it you are thinking how good the model looked in it, not how she will look.    I've experienced the same thing.  The best you can do is to pick some out for her and leave it in the bathroom for her while she is showering, or on her side of the bed to find it while you are taking your shower.    Kinda like doing the dishes .. you don't think of it until you are reminded.  Remind her of your interest.|`|kbz5S3waaa	Yes, I love to wear lingerie for my husband (he says that it's dorky, but I know deep down he likes it). I LOVE wearing it for him.

My hubby called me from work and asked how much we were spending on each other for xmas...then he brought home a bunch of pics of different lingerie that he thought he'd like, and i'd like.  then we went to the store and got sum.  i've loved it ever since.  i don't always wear it, but i love to.  it makes you feel sexy.  but some people don't like to bother with it...maybe she just isn't into it.  next time right before naughty time, ask her to put something you bought her on.  it doesn't get anymore obvious than that!!!|`|4V3LVIc4aa	i have never worn it for my man. but we dont have a lot of money and cant afford it. i would if i could. and i know he would love it. maybe u need to ask her to take a long bath and tell her u r going to set out some clothes for her to put on when she gets out and lay something sexy out on the bed for her and ask her to come and get u when she is ready to show u. or ask her to put on a sexy fahion show for u. get a cammerea and take pictures.|`|dtHjJah5aa	I wear it for my husband.  I wear it for special occations...I don't wear it every night.  He says I'm just as sexy in my little shorts and t-tanks...so that makes me feel good to give him something special like wearing the Victoria's Secret for him.  (Maybe you should lay it out on the bed and ask her to put it on for you....and you should be wearing something sexy as well....it isn't a one way street.)  Good luck.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	I wear it...hubby doesn't give a lick. He likes naked. He's all about business. You'd think in 14 years he'd appreciate the effort.   Don't know why your Gf isn't the same...I thought lingerie was for women and not men. WE are the ones who like to play dress-up.|`|dDasUgW8aa	Maybe she just doesn't feel sexy enough to wear the stuff in front of you.  I actually do wear lingerie- quite a bit- for my husband- I'm actually going out shopping for some new stuff after work today!
wzXJOSIeaa	Just tell them if this is the love of your life than there is no reason to hide it. Cause I'm tell you right now...a lot of guys your age still have not grown up! and that's real!|`|HhugjHIAaa	Thats weird.|`|IzHkb1neaa	just be honest and say you love each other. it will be okay.|`|03GQ637Raa	You are an adult.  Tell them straight out.  It's your love life and you are too old to be acting like a kid.  If u love this man/woman than be proud and happy and let ur family know he/she is your soulmate.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Just tell them you are dating someone older that you, and that you are very happy. Let them think about it for a second, and then tell them how much older.  If they panic, just tell them it is ok and that you are a big girl and can take care of yourself.|`|cpiK9fBFaa	your over 18 and ur legally an adult    its your decision not ur parents    be happy    you owe it to yourself|`|4tDTQOgNaa	I would do it in a calm manner. Nothing to quick. Just know that there will probably be some bittersweet moments.|`|mxrlZEweaa	Just have them meet him if it's getting serious. You shouldn't have to hide him. Just set up a dinner for your family to meet him and then tell them that he is a little older than you, you don't have to tell them exactly how old he is. Let them judge him by who he is and not by his age. If he treats you well and really loves you then that's all your parent's should be worried about. They should want you to be happy and if he makes you happy then they should be ok with who you are dating. Good luck.|`|bIxZiOaxaa	tell them in a way in which it is kind of comical and that might take the heat off, for instance, mum and dad i had the same reaction :)|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	emmy?? i see you are taking my advice about talking to your parents about this.. just be honest open and ask your parents to be happy for you and have your BF take you 4 out to a nice restaurant pay for dinner and look at is as life..not something to be ashamed of..look at it this way..your father get a new golf partner that he is compatible with!!  its nothing to worry about have fun and if you are acting happy about him to your parents,,iam sure thats all they care about and he is a decnt guy ..no hang ups..have dinner in a nice restaurant and have Bf pay ha ha good luck..emmy|`|WChr31Otaa	You approach it with a quick exiting stradegy when things get bad...J/k. You are a mature girl and are fully responsible for all of your decisions.  You should not have to hide this from your family. They should understand that you are well capable of making your own choices in life.  They should get passed the label of age as you have. I'm sure they will be happy that you have found someone you are happy with, that's what really matters here.  As for breaking the news, just tell your closest relatives and have them spread it around the family. Then at the next family event bring him along. Family is something that will accept you no matter what.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Wait til your 30th birthday, if it's still alive, you can let everyone know. Just kidding!    Are you both ready to go public? Then go public. People can disapprove of a relationship for a whole host of reasons. Are you worried the relationship won't withstand the scrutiny of others' judgment? Don't worry if you are, it's probably somewhat natural.     How has your family reacted to your prior relationships? Has your family/his ever been the source of sabotage for any of them, friendships, romances, whatever? Did you know that one of the top five reasons for divorce is your in-laws? Potential in-laws can be really scary, and you are at that age where people expect you to be shopping for life, so their scrutiny is sometimes really horrible.     Don't just reveal it because you are sick of hiding it, reveal it because you are excited and happy about it and you want others to share in your joy. If your family is a joy-killer for you, always questioning your decisions and your relationships, maybe keep this one under wraps until you are okay with whatever it is that anyone else may say, and evaluate the relationship for yourself as well.|`|AhXsy5p8aa	at a good moment where everyone is happy.. bring up the topic but DO NOT  throw it at them. be gental its big news so you don't want to over overwhelm them. take it slow and don't forget to say how happy you are and how he is such a good guy and all the positive things. oh and don't make the age difference seem like a big deal its really not.      hope this helps.. :)|`|1isE17ojaa	Just tell them. Theres not much that they can do at this point. And hopfully they will be supporative!!!!

Obviously you have decided to keep if from your parents for a reason, I mean are you afraid of their reaction?  You are both grown adults so they may have their reservations about it but there really isn't too much they can do about it.  If the two of you are happy and he is sincere in his intentions for you then I say go for it!  Try not to let the small stuff get you down sugar.|`|2lcbnccJaa	ergh hard. very hard. just make sure they know that you're happy and that it's what you want. as long as your family is supportive of you and your decisions, they should be supportive of the fact that you're happy with an older man.    good luck :)|`|U3DK6ngEaa	I had to do this too. It was hard. We had 17 years difference.    We dated for about 6 months before I told my mom.I told my mom first because she is more understanding and layed back.     I told my dad a couple months after that. He was kind of speechless. I just started off by saying I have always made good decisions in the past and you have to trust my decisions now. I really love that person and we have been dating for a while. The reason I waited to tell you was because I wanted to feel out the situation to make sure this was right and now I am confident! He is GREAT!     ~~~~IT WILL ALL WORK OUT!!!~~~~    My ex, who is 17 years older, was really great! We dated for 3 1/2 years and we are still best friends. I would never have taken back my time with him!    GOOD LUCK!|`|pWy7iVvuaa	If you have been together for a year, and happy, then that's the risk you will have to take. Live your lives for yourselves and not your family.  You may never find a man that loves you or treats you the way this man does. This is what I say about parents of adults. Your parents don't necessarily have to like the person you choose to be with, but they do need to respect that person and vice versa.|`|QzokuJVsaa	I think youll probably be able to find the answer to your dilemma at Lisa Dailys site, http://www.datingexpert.tv   (Plus, theres a lot of good info there.)

PZLwu9QAaa	If you are telling the truth, then it is very important for you to see a doctor.  It is even more important for you to realize that you have been sexually abused.  You may think you are mature enough to make these decisions, but it is a proven fact that children  under the age of 16, (18 in some cases), are not mature enough to make decisions about sex, and if you have been touched by your stepfather, even if you knowingly went into the situation, you have been sexually abused.  He used his age, sexual maturity, and position, to coax you into having sex.  This was very wrong,  and if you don't feel you can go to your mother, you definitely need to go to someone.  Maybe a school counselor or adult friend you can trust.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	that is seriously messed up! Yes, you should have said no! Dont do anything until you know for sure if you're pregnant. Then, you need to seriously think about what happened. What would your mom do if she found out that you had sex with your step dad? What are you doing dating a 19 year old? Are you okay with all of this? You need a therapist.|`|HlaEUb3Uaa	I sure hope your kidding.  At 14 you should have enough brains to know not to touch your damn step dad.  Who in the hell raised you?  I'll tell you now, if that was your mothers man you may have done the worst thing you could ever do to your mother.  You are on a path for destruction I've seen it too too many times.  Your best option is to go to the doctor.  You must know whether or not you are carrying.  Look into abortion.  If you mother is good you can tell her, but if there is any strain in your relationship it's best not too.  You have done something terrible, and now you risk the chance of ruining your mothers life by bringing in a child that she will most likely have to raise.  You think she's going to forgive you?  When she looks at the child that came from her daughter and possible HER lover, you think she's going to feel ok?  Listen hard to what all the adults are telling you.  Make an informed decision and don't tell anyone until you do.|`|JsffWlnEaa	thats crazy lol.remember to use protection next time.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	This is interesting drama.    Bi Sexuality  Gay Sex  Pregnancy    Each is a separate issue requiring unique approach.    This is a sobering rite of passage for you.  You are only innocent by virtue of your age.  It appears that there is some curiosity that has the better of everyone involved.    Boyfriend and certainly step dad should be more knowledgeable of the legal issues of intimacy with a 14 year old female.  DNA will determine paternity for whomever really want to know.    It sounds as if this was not the only event or incident of this trio.    You all need serious counseling.    You especially need a legal and personal advocate.

JERRY JERRY|`|AA10529198	No.  Telling your mom will only make her upset.  Wait to see if you're pregnant, and then look to see who it looks like when you have the baby.  If it looks like your Boyfriend, then, you can go move in with him (I mean, you will be 15, you are a woman) - - If it looks like your step dad, you can use it as blackmail to make him buy you clothes and stuff.|`|xbAd6Gg6aa	I doubt your telling the truth..

Assuming this is true. You are only 14 years old....why do you have a boyfriend? Why aren't you doing somrthing else with your time instead of having threesomes?     First off if you saw your boyfriend and step dad humping why didnt you stop it and put him out? Did you know that your boyfriend was bisexual? People this is a prime example of how reality tv have a very strong effect on our younger society. Majority of the young ones thinks its ok to have threesomes, or think its ok to have sex with someone of the same sex, or think its ok to do everyone in town, around town and out of town.     Where is your mother? You need to tell your mother that her husband/your step father is confused and you need to leave that confused boyfriend alone also and make sure you find out who the father of your child is? Do you understand there are sooooooo many diseases going around and the main one is AIDS.|`|HUy7ugDUaa	YES you should talk to you mom.

QIQNzE11aa	this is not how a good marriage should be. My husband and i have never put each other down. I answered a question the other day about how i feel two people should be on the same educational playing field when married. For some stupid reason, your husband thinks less of you. He's quite ignorant of what an RN is.. basically a doctor without the degree. You have to deal with all the crap, the doctor whisks in for a few moments, after you write down everything that is wrong. Then the dr. says do a few things, and you are left to do them all. You manage everything when it comes to patients. Dealing with an autistic daughter is also not easy, especially home schooling her.     This man is the epitome of ignorance. Intelligent people do not look down on others. They know other people's jobs are hard as well. Your position takes both physical labor, intellectual intensity as well as someone able to think on their feet while they are running. One of the hardest feats i know of. Not many can think so quickly on the spot and bring years of medical knowledge to any table.     Your husband is controlling to say the least when it comes to the pay. In my marriage, when we both worked at different jobs (we own our own company together now) we always knew what the other one made. Made it simpler to pay bills and to know if we could afford something.     He totally takes you for granted. This thing with flirting with other women in front of you, attrocious. If my husband dared, i'd walk away and continue to keep walking. I couldn't imagine flirting with someone in front of him and i demand the same respect back. There are some couples who are ok with flirting in front of each other. But if one is not ok with it, then it should not be going on.     By tolerating this behavior, your kids have learned that you and other woman can be treated disrespectfully.     I never suggest leaving. Go to an attorney and find out the best way to get him kicked out of the house instead. When you leave a house, you can lose your rights to it. Sounds like he's hoping to get you to leave so he doesn't have to give you half. File for a legal separation on grounds of cruelty. You'll win it easily. This is mental and emotional abuse. Even financial if he's not showing you his pay check but demands to know yours. I wouldn't bring them home anymore if i were you. "Forget" the pay stubs at the bank when you open your own account and keep your money for yourself. Tell him you didn't bring them home and never will again. Period.     Go to an attorney if you are thinking of getting out. You can try marriage counseling with this man... but i'm not so sure he'd gain anything by it. Not with a family who is so happy to see him treating his wife, and the mother of his children, so poorly.   Best of luck!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	He needs to see a councilor. He is one of those people that needs to belittle people to make himself feel good about himself. How have you let this go on for so long?|`|yC4REA3waa	seems like it|`|W1rCsvTzaa	This sounds really really bad.  What would he say about you if someone asked him how you treat him?|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	he sounds like a controlling ***(excuse me). I wouldnt put anything of ours or your kids in his name. I wouldnt let him manage the money. I think hes doing things behind your back. Thats just crazy, you dont do that to your marriage-or treat your wife like that.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I could be wrong... but to me he doesn't sound abusive. But he sounds like a terrible husband who is an assh*le. If you are pretty sure he is cheating, which it sounds like he is, that's a good excuse to leave!! 3rd time's a charm. You now know exactly what you DON'T want in a marriage. There are much better men than the ones you have chosen.|`|jtjISk6qaa	ooh dump his sorry ***|`|f6YsGOynaa	He's abusing you.|`|AA11138696	No this is not how marriage is supposed to be.  This is a controlling manipulative and abusive man.  You need to keep your money to fund your escape.  This might not be physical abuse but it is mental and emotional abuse and shows a lack of respect not to mention love from this man.  Time to get out deary, you did it before, you can do it again.|`|Qlpj04L3aa	I wouldn't say he is abusive but kind of jerk sometimes.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Ultamatum time.  Tell him to get off the booze and start treating you with respect or you are finished with him.  Nobody deserves the abuse he is putting on you and it is abuse, sorry.  You deserve better.|`|yy45iAbtaa	no it is not and stop giving your pay check to him.why don't you go talk to a lawyer.the ball is in your court right know make sure the house is in your name also.if the house is in your name ask him to leave the home you are not happy if he does not call the police to take him out but make sure you have your lawyer he will have to pay all legal fees.don't worry you will get alimony child support even if your children are in colledge make sure you ask for child support as long as your children are in colledge.because it seems to me your husband is setting you up for something.he works at a bank he is not stupid he probably has his money in an account you have no idea about or 2 different accounts you need to contact a lawyer and do not tell your husband nothing about it.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	yes it is abuse. Divorce him. you deserve better. he is not happy with himself so he is going to out you down to make himself fell better. Hun i been there with my sons dad..  I am now married to a wonderful man who supports me .  you deserve someone who loves and respects you and who will support you..  Get a lawyer and file for a divorce make him pack up and leave|`|QCmRRbABaa	It is how "YOUR" marriage is.He's abusive (emotional and economic) and alcoholic. If doesn't show you his pay stub, you don't show him yours. Of course you don't give him your whole pay. Stop abuse depends on you.  Women don't have to obey a husband, specially when he's irrational. Learn how to defend yourself and how to stop abuse in your relationship. I was in an abusive relationship as well. I learn  from a book called Taking Power in an Abusive Relationship by Agata Campos. That relationship when from abusive to friendly, divorce included.|`|lzooHi0Baa	I just had to read the first paragraph to realize the abuse and insecurity you are living.   Marriage is love and there is none on his part.   Fight for your happiness.  Seek the help you need to stop being a codependent of this idiot and go on with your life.   Life is too short and beautiful to live it as a martyr.|`|3M3JbB0oaa	No. Something funny is going on with him. He should never talk down to you and I would not believe a word he says. If I were you I would "quietly" be checking up on him. The answer will reveal itself.|`|BENiX8eDaa	I know it will be hard, but you need to get an attorney and leave him as soon as possible. He is an as$ and you are to good of a person for him. None of the good times matter if he manipulates and treats you this way.  You are healthy, attractive and kind. Way more than he deserves.   Please, get out now, you have so much life ahead of you.  Don't worry about the kids, they will do ok because you will be doing better.|`|lIvpmn0Jaa	forget this husband or your you deserve better   dont feel bad about yourself hes a asshole  good luck|`|2sF0qPjBaa	That is not a happy marriage. He is trying to make you feel like you are not good enough, when really he is the problem. I'm sure you can do so much better. This guy has absolutely no respect for you. He should treat you good and compliment you, not compare you to other younger women.    I would leave, there is just no excuse for that type of behavior.|`|aJjV5b95aa	In my opinion he is abusive, you do not deserve to be treated like that. I wouldn't put up with it. I think you should demand some respect from him but you probably won't get it since he feels it is okay to treat you this way. If you don't get it I think that you should start to move on.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Your husband is abusive and you should get away from him. Especially with alcohol involved. You don't need to be with a drunken abusive man for any reason.  Do not give him control of your money. Give him enough for your part of the bills and save the rest. Put it in an account in your maiden name or something. Just don't let him near it.  After you have saved enough to get out, then just go. Take a day off work and get your stuff and leave.  If he wants to work on the marriage with a counselor then fine, but do it while you are living somewhere else so you can have some peace in your life.|`|e7dAJAA6aa	Yes- he's deeming and controling. He's your husband so i don't think you should leave him but he definatly needs counseling.|`|CItYLBibaa	In marriage it is important that the man has control.  Ever since I met my fiance he controls my life.  He takes my paycheck, and it goes into his account.  He gives me 10 dollars a day to take care of what ever I need.  When he goes out, he doesnt have to tell me where he is going or when he will be back.  I am not to go out with my friends.  I'm not aloud to close the door when I shower or use the bathroom.  Im not aloud to talk unless I am spoken to.  I address him as "Sir".  When he wants to have sex, we have sex, just the way he wants it, normal, oral, anal, what he says go because he is the man.  If I dont fallow his rules I get punnished.....Thats just the way it is in relationships, the man is in charge.  You are lucky you have a man who treats you as well as he does.  As his wife, it is your job to make him happy.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Is he abusive?  Maybe not.  Is he loving?  definitely not.  I would classify it as bullying.  And the best way to stop a bully is to stand up to him.    I'd say you insist that you both start seeing marriage counseling.  Perhaps that will wake him up to how he makes you feel.  Be sure you tell him.  Learn to ask directly if he knows how he makes you feel, and don't worry about awkward situations.  If you have shared those things and he hasn't changed, start confronting it with questions when it happens.  For example, when you say you can't have kids to his family, and he corrects you that he can, ask him directly, in front of them, "How do you think it makes me feel when you say that?"  When he says he doesn't know, keep pressing him.  If he says he doesn't care, say "that is our problem, would you be willing to go to counseling with me to save our marriage?"  When he is talking up the girl at work and demeaning your accomplishments, ask him if he thinks she is better - probably not, but if he insists on insulting you like that, tell him, "I want you to learn how to not insult me and encourage me instead, would you be willing to go to counseling with me to save our marriage?"  After a few months, he will either stop the bullying and start thinking about what he does and how it makes you feel, or he will agree to counseling, or you will know he doesn't love you and it is time to move on - then move on.  Don't worry about revenge, or "getting yours" or any of that - it is poisonous and will hurt your relationship with the kids.  Just move on.    Good luck!|`|dtHjJah5aa	Yes dear....he is abusing you emotionally.  Don't let him get away with it anymore!  Tell him that he needs to start showing you his paycheck stub or you won't be showing yours.  Also, let him do some of the cyber schooling for your daughter, then maybe he'll appreciate you for doing it.  You two definitely need some marriage counseling.  You were physically abused so you think as long as he isn't hitting you that it isn't abuse....but it is and can be more hurtful than physical abuse.  You need to draw the line.  Good luck.|`|WaOR3iicaa	in desperate need of marriage counseling. and im NOT KIDDING.  to answer your question, yes he's abusive.    to the girl who said dump his @ss, are you retarded, she's been with him for freakin 16 years and has children with him.|`|ftrKT4NVaa	i'm sorry.  no that is not how marriage should be. now i understand that you have yrs of experience on me. (i've only been married for about a month a two days) but i think that my wife and i are starting on the right foot. i as the guy used to not be responsible, and be the money spender. and my wife she has always been responsible and she's the money maker, (she makes almost twice as much) but what we did is we try to share the duties of the house, i manage the budget, but i don't do it in a way that she doesn't know what goes on, as a matter of fact the budget that we both created is on her computer, and as far as the checks, like i said she makes more, but my check (as well as hers) get deposited to the same share account. and we get an 'allowance' if you will, we get certain amount of money that we sat down and agreed on. the reason why i tell you all this is because you have to start a pattern in order to keep that pattern.   has your husband start one way and changed or has he been this way all the time?   have you guys considered marriage counseling?  i think that you guys could turn it around, it's never too late. if you guys love each other, you would be able to get through, but MOST of all you guys have to TRUST GOD, and include him in your plans, and your home, and HE will help you guys get through. GOOD LUCK.|`|fACWmhuFaa	HI ,Reading you question, you come over as an intelligent person, unfortunately you have previously been in a marriage which was physically abusive,and by misfortune have found yourself in a second marriage which is verbally abusive, which is a kind of battering that doesn't leave evidence. Outbursts of sarcasm, judging and criticizing are all traits of this, its also manipulative and controlling as you have found, and the ultimate goal is to control. Your husbands demand to seeing your pay stub and wanting full control of money proves this point. No this isn't how marriage should be, but it is up to you to decide what to do in this situation, unless there is some reconciliation between you both the chances are it will not get better, and you have to take into consideration your children and what effect this is having on them to.  Chances are your husband will not change so are you willing to spend the rest of your married life under this cloud, of deceit and abuse? I do wish you well whatever your decision.
4293T0LNaa	no that is out of line, WAY out of lline. hes YOUR fiance not ur room mates. there is obviously a problem here, why the hell is he lying in her bed? and cuddling? and staying up to talk to him?? if my fiance were to ever do that to me, id be soooo pissed. if youve already talked to ur fiance about this and he doesnt seem to understand why this angers u, u should talk to ur room mate, if u havent already. if this still doesnt work u should start considering a new room mate, since this isnt gonna work out. u do have the right to be angry,     best of luck to you :D|`|AA11185479	Hugging is fine.  Being friends is fine.  But cuddling in her bed crosses the line.  You have a right to express your feelings, if you do so maturely and reasonably.  You have a right to say "This behavior makes me uncomfortable" and they should respect that.  By simply dismissing your feelings and accusing you of unfairness or jealousy, they are trying to draw attention away from behavior that they know is inappropriate.  You need to have a serious talk with both of them, and let them know that their behavior is crossing a line you can't accept.  If they aren't willing to modify their behavior, then you have a right to modify yours - by moving out and ending the engagement.|`|edIUAbCxaa	He's being out of line. He shouldnt be doing that with your roommate. If i were you, Id leave him|`|f848f2bd049ab143a6b0f7c8ef72e5d1aa	he is wayyyy out of line and so is she i would kill em both!
0HO8sTGeaa	no it's normal|`|crZg76Hpaa	No, it will not seem desperate.
qW3dVcRtaa	I think the attached pics would be great spring/ summer colors depending on what colors you like: These are mostly photos of flowers but it is some place to start getting and idea of how colors look together if anything:    http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...  http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...      Good Luck and Congrats!|`|11qdMtlGaa	Mint Green and Chocolate Brown or  Yellow and Bright Pink  But really you could do anything you wanted! GOOD LUCK!|`|cIJ960Wbaa	My wedding colors are a aqua blue and canary yellow. I picked the by going in wedding stores looking at colors. Orange and yellow are really cute colors for spring as well, Try davids bridal they have a huge selection and colors of dresses to choose from that's how i picked my colors.|`|AA10405438	Yellow and peach are great spring colors.|`|woOeYFrEaa	I had a wedding in April and did this.    My bridesmaids were in navy dresses (tea length since it was an afternoon wedding), and then my flowers were tulips--buttery yellow, soft and bright pink.  The yellow and the pinks against that darker navy blue really popped.    At the reception I used more of a periwinkle type lighter blue as the accent color instead of navy.|`|AA10766729	Here's a well-guarded secret for you:      You can have ANY colors you want for your wedding at any time of the year you choose!      You do not need to have pastel pinks & blues in the spring, anymore than you must have jewel tones in winter.  If you want russets & browns for your wedding in April, well more power to you!    You're going to hear this a LOT, but in this particular case it's a fact: It's YOUR wedding, so do what YOU want....within reason, of course!    Have fun with it...it's a once-in-a-lifetime event.  Do it YOUR way and you'll have fewer regrets.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like amethyst and lime.  It looks really, really pretty.  If you like pink, you can do a bold fuschia color with a lighter shade of pink, ivory, crisp white, purple or lime (again).  You could do turquoise and peach or turquoise and yellow or turquoise and bright orange or coral.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Hey my wedding is in May 2010 as well!! I am using champagne and light green with small hints of pink here and there.     You can use pinks, yellow, aqua, turqoise. With spring the possibilites are endless. You can use pink and brown..pink and black and white....turqoise and yellow. What I did was just pick out two colors I liked and used champagne as my neutral. Hope this helps.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	my brother is getting married in April and their colors are pink and orange. At davids bridal the colors are Tangerine and Azalea.     The colors look great together. The guys are wearing white tuxes and with orange ties. The girls are wearing the pink dresses and carrying orange flowers.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	My sister is the same way and her wedding is this spring. She is using an apple color with cream accents or possible a pale yellow.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	Hello my fellow May 2010 Bride:    I say choose whatever colors you want!  We chose to do our birthstones no matter what season the wedding was going to be in (Aquamarine with Garnet as the accent.    What's more important is making your wedding personal.|`|ZJFjCdYXaa	Right now I have the David's Bridal book in front of me. They have the nicest colors in there. You could do something like orange. Not a ugly glow in the dark orange, but it looks really nice. They have patterns now that look really nice. You could do patterns and solids to mix it up. They also have the blues that are really pretty. There's like a robin egg blue and a teal and like a sea foam color. It blends really well together. I'm going with a canary yellow for my wedding this summer. They also have the patterns for that and a deeper yellow called saffron. It too blends together very well.You could do purples and lilacs, fuchsias and pinks, or greens and celery colors. They all complement each other very well. Just a matter of what you like best. Hope it helps and congrats!
1Ayb4UK7aa	Well, you should have said something to her instead of waiting 2 years but what's done is done.  You should talk to her and ask her out.  Just because some other guy says he loves her doesn't mean she feels the same about him.  Give it a shot, you have nothing to lose at this point.|`|RaIfKSVbaa	ask het out quick be4 she is gone with the other person you yhu nly have 1 chace to live beat for it..                      xx|`|GwLs1sfyaa	tell her how u feel about her
TstiC2Ilaa	In a way it is. If you have to hide it from your girlfriend because you know it will hurt her or upset her, in my book that's cheating. And it's very disrespectful to your girlfriend. So I'd tell that other girl to go.|`|ULgGWDnWaa	its not exactly cheating but its still not right! how would you feel if it was the other way around? also even though you said that's as far as it goes the other person is probably still having false hope!|`|A65C8cmeaa	Yes it is and that's why you feel bad because you know it is.|`|AA11706291	In my mind yes because you betraying your partner emotionally.|`|KzQ3cujfaa	YES!! Its just like phone sex without the voices.|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	it isnt exactly cheating, but it is showing that your not loyal and cant be trusted very well|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Its not physically cheating but it is still really bad im sure your partner would be really upset if they found out|`|0RcnOgA7aa	Yes stupid.|`|t6wid9xaaa	Well this depends on your perspective... in my opinion you are... not physically. But I bet that your partners wouldn't be happy about it. Put yourself in your girlfriend's place... what would she think of feel? Or how would you feel I f you see your girl txt flirty with another hot dude?  If you are asking it is because you feel that is not correct.  Good Luck mate!|`|hq0VAXDbaa	yeh man, if your in a relationship flirting has to stop IMEDIATLY its even worse that your actualy texting flirts instead of casual ones when their with you,  and sending pictures? WHAT THE HELL R U THINKING!!!!!! if you want to do that do it to your partner not friends or random people it makes them feel unwanted, ugly and above all, worthless.    its not exactly cheating, but you might aswell have. basicly, what i mean there is that; realy, its as bad as cheating.    why r u flirting if your with someone anyway, you obviously dont love them and you cant like them too much. if thats what im thinking, imagine what they must feel.    who ever you are, you lucky you still have whoever it is you have and if you get dumped, im sory but it serves you right. atleast youll learn from this that flirting stops as soon as you get into a relationship, if you want to flirt or you feel the need to flirt, flirt with your partner!|`|AA12191000	I wouldn't like my other half to be doing it to me!|`|4Ydn2d9waa	seriously dude, id advise you to stop i know it probably started off small.. but it can lead up to much worse..  seriously it broke my parents up.|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	Depends on what you said..|`|Fh76mMuUaa	YESSSS WHAT THE HECK.. itd hurt your gf which is emotionally cheatingand pictures is kinda physical.|`|EHvuLXpzaa	I would say yes. Stop now.|`|14ZoC4pwaa	yeah, i'd personally be hurt if my boyfriend did that... cause he'd be basically wooing another girl besides me :///|`|YNKTDR42aa	Its not exactly cheating unless you kiss her or something, but you still shouldnt be texting her|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	No it's not cheating as such, but it shows your not commited to your partner. Would you like it if he/she was doing the same to you? I bet you wouldn't. Talk to her or finish her. It's obvious that your still looking around.|`|0BrVE2nvaa	It sounds like you already know it is in your mind.  The question you should be asking yourself is why are you doing it? Are you unhappy in your current relationship, or do you just enjoy the attention? There's nothing wrong with wanting a little attention once in a while but if you carry on like this eventually someone's going to get hurt.|`|SsB7aRExaa	There's a really easy way to answer that question.    If it had been your girlfriend who was texting that way to some other guy, would you be happy about it?  Or upset?    There's your answer.|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	yes it is.
EHVGbev6aa	He may be confused and not know what he wants right now and keeps running to you for comfort but you push him away. Let him cry on your shoulder and be a friend! That's the only thing you can do and in the end he may realize that you really care about him and he might want to take that extra step. Just be his friend right now and don't push him away!|`|ReH5EoR0aa	He is a player.       You are being played.     Probably confused himself.       Needy.    I'd steer clear of this one.|`|ruczpWrGaa	Honey, he doesn't love either of you.  He just doesn't want to be alone. You were right for what you told him.|`|5N1rEjiqaa	Her
8hIUOajLaa	Maybe he would be better as just a friend, the problem with taking that route is that if he says no, you will have neither.    Alternatively, you could try being upfront with him treating you the way he does and try get things to change.|`|0BrVE2nvaa	Stop thinking about wether you love him and start thinking about wether he loves you.  If he really treats you that badly the answer should be obvious.|`|qjF7rFqZaa	PROS AND CONS!  DERRRR|`|dT5qnpKzaa	you like being treated like ****? its probably goin to get even worse.|`|h7xh61TWaa	If he treats you badly? LEAVE HIM.    Don't get involved with someone who doesn't care for you... you shouldn't love someone who doesn't love you and SHOW that he loves you.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You don't love him - you have an addiction to him. Love is supposed to make you feel good about yourself, and you obviously don't feel good about yourself    Get away from him now. He is toxic and is never going to change. He is emotionally abusive to you. No woman deserves to be treated like crap. And the only reason guys do it is because there are enough women who are weak or stupid enough to stick around.    If he were your best friend, he would not treat you like crap or make you feel worthless. Friends don't do that to other friends. Your friends are supposed to make you feel like you are the most amazing person in the world|`|AGbusTqGaa	If the bad times outweigh the good then you need to end it.  Thats the best advice I have ever been given when it comes to relationship issues|`|0HO8sTGeaa	leave him..... you deserve a special 1 |`|qjg0g5WMaa	the harder it is to maintain a relationship the more it seems necessary to be in that relationship so the best thing to do is to write down the pros and cons and decide if it is a healthy relationship if it isnt then you need to move on if you decide you want to stay then you need to express your concerns to him|`|qQAVLbofaa	Hmmmm, prepare for a zombie invasion...and then decide. Or play volleyball...........|`|NAqfPvmHaa	dump him right away!!if he's being such an *** you deserve better!|`|iYWD0Daiaa	Dump him. You should never stay with someone who treats you like that. He also sounds potentially abusive.|`|m31vJe5xaa	If he makes you feel like crap and being worthless you should not have been with him after the first or second time of that. Your in an abusive relationship and that is something you never want to get caught in, my advice is to get out quick. But be careful because if he has been able to get away with abusive language you never know if he could get physical, so have a friend with you or at least nearby when you break up. Try not to get caught in abusive relationships, they can be dangerous. Good luck    Hope this helps|`|BENiX8eDaa	who cares if you think you love him or if you have a good time sometimes...It's not worth it if you suffer most of the times because he's an ***,  LEAVE him ASAP!|`|QLMW7HRMaa	Yeah,  you're still with an ***.  Sounds like he should by a wife beater tank.  Cause you won't dump him now, he can do what ever he wants.  All you'll do is complain to the internet.     Dump him, move on, never take him back or stop complaining.
0udjgaoBaa	Its a long distance thing? Those are boring ...I have no advice.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	In my line of work I have seen my share of travesties for people who meet other people they met on the Internet. I wouldn't recommend it. However with that said, you will do what you want to do so here's some advice. You want to meet where there are other people around, such as a restaurant, coffee shop, etc. make sure you meet them during daytime hours. Good luck.|`|5c6F8ogkaa	check she has the same intensions as u (just to be sure)  then slip it in somewhere that u wonna meet. keep it casual
ecNeN0staa	I always found that when people are just shutting you out, leave them alone.  If she doesn't find her way back to you, it's her loss.|`|fR2Geezcaa	She will probably get over it without a talk from you. It is hard after building a life with someone to see with your very own eyes that they have moved on. You have tried for months to be friends and talk with her and she has not given in yet, she probably won't after seeing you with someone else.     I would try again in the future when the wound from seeing you and the other girl is not so fresh. For now, do what you have ben doing, be casual and nice to her unless you want to get back with her? If you do want her back, then you need to do everything you can to fix it now and to get her to talk to you.     As long as she is tied to your family business she will remain a part of your life. If you really want to stay friends with her, let more time go by and for heaven's sake don't take another date anywhere she may show up at. As soon as she starts dating, she will get over it.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	she ended it with you ..and she wants you back.. only to end it again .. dont fall for it mate .. stay with the other girl she wants you ..|`|IzHkb1neaa	let it go...you are destined to fall again. Stop the chaos now.|`|9ImX52QQaa	If she's not willing to talk to you, the best I can say is that you should move on. Leave a message simply saying "I can understand why you don't want to talk to me... But this is going to be the last time I try to call you. When you're ready, call me. But until then, I also have to move on." And if you're sure you really do still love your ex say "I love you." alongside that. If you want some more help, you can message me, or whatnot, I've been in way too many relationships, and know way too much of this stuff.|`|OYzPApodaa	she is ANGRY  and HURT  she saw you with that other girl...that's like torture  tell everyone you know that will talk to her how much you would like to talk with her  let it leak back slowly  give her some space and time  if you want her back...don't date  does she have a sister or mom or dad that will talk to you?  See if you can find out what she's thinking through them  this way you will know if its even worth it to try  she may never talk to you again   sorry  good luck|`|yyIVrngcaa	get your aunt to talk to her for you.|`|03GQ637Raa	Since u r having a hard time talking to her ur self, get a good friend to talk to her in ur behalf.  Also, if u have her address, write to her all u r feelings.|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	well your ex obv still has feelings for you. If youve tried contacting her and are still getting no response then stop. She just might not be ready to start things with you again, give her time, eventully shell come around.|`|mxrlZEweaa	I don't think your ex really loves you. If she did you guys wouldn't have broken up and she would answer your calls. I think the only reason she was upset is because she realized that you are moving on and you're no longer going to be there for her when she wants. I think you should continue dating this new girl. Give her or someone else a chance. Your ex might realize that you are what she wants and come running back to you.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Try getting your aunt to talk to her, and tell her how you feel.  As for teh new girl, decide who you want more, the new or the old, and go for what you want.  Good luck,|`|9e23f7c9397660be7ec726421c87a9acaa	i'm only fourteen. but i think you should just walk right up to her and tell her you want to talk. face to face talking is better than texts, calls, emails, everything. it means a lot more. i understand that you still love her, if i was in your shoes i would to. and explain to her everything. how you feel. what you think. and whatever else you think you need and want her to know. and see where it goes from there.     good luck, go getta. (:|`|r7sgshwKaa	Give her some space. You can't force anyone to talk to you. Maybe she will come around. Im curious what you did with the new girl? Did you like kick her to the curb or what?  If you still love your ex why have you moved on?  You obviously are still into her so just give her some room and hope that she comes around. Valentines Day is coming up, give her something special. You know we like that crap!|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	Hey.    Try to move on and make love happen again :) (she clearly does not want to talk about it).     As for the crying, she is probably just upset that she hasn't found someone and you have. This does not necessarily mean she likes you again.     Get rid of everything you have that reminds you of her and start over.    Good luck.
OR5PhU40aa	If she's as nice as you say she is, she won't care if you're short one inch compared to her exes. If I wasn't a virgin and I'd had experience with big ****s, I'd pay it no mind.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Yes, for anyone but you.  You seem like you have no self confidence.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	size dose not matter its what you do with it that counts mate .. if she wants you ..ask her and see ..|`|kK2mecABaa	No  As much as you think about *****   you should be with a dude|`|ITfBQzg6aa	What?? ARE U SEROUS??|`|03GQ637Raa	Yes, it;s not the size it's how u use it smile!!!!|`|INAiAOD6aa	Yes, girls shouldnt care about that, i mean some do, but how do you really know that shes been with guys with 7-9 inches, there is no way to prove that. Size isnt everything, and any ways, thickness is better then length=]  go for it!  good luck!|`|Ac1Qdr72aa	do you truely like her??? like dont just go for her if its just going to be a fling like listen to your heart|`|4tDTQOgNaa	At the end of the day it will be you and that girl. If you feel that you could do damage I say go for it. At least you can't say you didn't try.|`|m31vJe5xaa	If your asking this question, you probably shouldn't be going for her. If you want to date someone they have to like you, not your stuff. If your just trying to hook up, don't ask about how to do it on Yahoo.|`|wQEdey24aa	u know what, im just going to pretend I didn't read this question.    GIRLS AREN'T SEX TOYS OR OBJECTS...just thought id let you know.|`|jgEvnYNlaa	Sure as long as you can take her laughing when you drop your drawers.|`|3Tqq1nCGaa	OK, if she's a slut who knows what your going to get from her. I wouldn't touch her dude. Find someone you like and you know your going to stay with for a long time.|`|6bEarQzdaa	you wouldn't be big enough for her after shes had 7-9 inch ones  naaa bad idea don't embaress yourself|`|4HTMZ97Saa	why would it matter the size of your penis. if she loves you, it'll be who you are.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Why not? Do her then dump her.She may be loose.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Yeah why not. 6 inches is actually bigger than average. Average is 5. Personally I think 7-9 is way too big. If she's nice go for it. Not sure about the slutty part tho.|`|KcUX0WCeaa	well...i dont care how long the penis was that went inside her.  Some of the worlds best lovers are 6 inches and know how to work it.

Eat Funyuns.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	heck yeah. use a rubber and get to sticking
X7z0KWXbaa	i kind of know what your talking about, ive given my bf many second chances for his constant flirting throughout our relationship with an ex gf    i know its easy to just hate him and move on with ya life but there is always a deeper issue because if he was intending to meet with these people then he wouldnt still be with you after 8 years    i know ur probably feeling betrayed and confused at the moment , especially at the whole sexual aspect of things but theres a few sides to this      do you trust him with all of this? because u obviously love him if ur willing to put up with it the other times but now its going to be harder to trust him    perhaps if u gave it a month or so after having a massive showdown with him to let him prove that hes worth ur time    but u owe him nothing at al, he has betrayed ur trust and if he really cares about you he will be willing to sort himself out and fight for you    i wouldnt back down to him and just give in, make him do the leg work for your relationship,     i hope this works out for you, and dw a long rant is not all bad|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	Well.  Right now all you have evidence of is some searching, which could just be a curiousity.  I agree that you've invested a lot of time into this, but I question why after 8 years you are unable to communicate with one another.  I feel that you are feeling the same thing.  You have to pressure him to open up and talk to you, and regardless of his fetishes (if they so exist) that's really more of a relationship killer than anything else.  That being said, if I were to question him about his "interests" I'd do it in a less obvious way as saying "What are your fantasies?" - I might say something like, how do you feel about this or that (maybe something you "accidently" come across in a book, or newspaper, in a movie, etc.) and see how he reacts, try to invoke a conversation that way.  For the sake of your own happiness, you should really ask yourself how much more time you can invest in a person who just can't open up after so long.  1 year, 5 years, 8 years, or 20 years... every day is yours to enjoy to the fullest - no matter what your past, or what effort you've put into something.  Everyday is a fresh start.    Best of Luck.
AA11588121	A genuine, quality friendship persists through time.  It is about not letting trivial, or even rather large, conflicts get in the way.  Both people must put in conscious effort to maintain a true friendship.  Sacrifice, tears and tests are inevitable.  A true friend would stay up all night to listen to your issues.  They would continue to listen day after week after month after years, listening to the same or similar problem, and still actually care about what you have to say.  A Real friend would write to you in jail multiple times, if not at least every month for years.  The relationship is understood at a higher emotional, mental, spiritual and intellectual level.     True friendship is a different type of love.  It becomes a commitment.  Shared experiences enhance the bond, but does not necessarily build genuine understanding.  Trust, loyalty, forgiveness, patience and the ability to communicate well will all tested.  A friend who truly understands your logic must understand your state of emotion.  Disagreements are bound to occur, but the real test is your tolerance.  Maintaining such a friendship means putting aside convenience--It must be consciously prioritized as a part of your life style.  Just as family would and probably always will be a part of your life, so should true friends.  These friendships help you figure out and create who you are and what you value.  It teaches you to perceive in depth each others perspective of the world. It's no longer mainly about how much time you spend with them, but more about who is down for you when times are thin and your world is crumbling apart.  It's about being selfless to a certain degree for each others well beings.  Their problems are your problems/business and vice versa.    They have unconditional love and care, like the way you forever love your child, for you.  Good advice enhances, but genuine care forms the foundation.  Embarrassment caused by others and things society shuns of you are small obstacles in the way; the real obstacle is somehow expressing to each other how under appreciated they are.  Real friends accept you and see you for who you are instead of categorize you based on your gender and whatnot.  Past wrong doings and regrets do not define or provoke their judgment of you.    Good friends understand your sense of humor and see eye to eye with you on something, if not many things.  They bring out a part of you that you usually don't feel the need to show with others, being resilient when you are usually not.  You mature and learn together with them and have at least some underlying values.  They encourage each other to achieve higher goals.   Genuine friends develop your individuality as you learn to overcome the rejection of your parents and other friends of your friendship--such situations teach you to think for yourself and not let society's influence overcome you.|`|pFcMVKMJaa	friendship is dynamic man a person who you can share everything with. who comes to your head when you are most in need and need help.a person you can depend on. i think friendship is the most wonderful relationship in this World.|`|zGid9wJBaa	EVERYTHING!!!
IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, its pretty neat, you'll probably find enough things to do there to keep you busy for a week. As long as you both like hiking and biking, you'll be alright.|`|4POGapREaa	It is fairly small but there are a lot of things to do.  My husband & I went to Maui for our honeymoon & we barely even left our little area.  Catalina has some incredible snorkeling adventures so think about it, that right there takes up a full day, plus exploring the restaurants, a day for shopping, picking up souvenirs, maybe scuba dive another day, get an in room massage, etc.  I think that's an awesome idea to avoid the whole flying issue.  I HATE flying myself & was seriously considering Catalina for our next getaway even though it's right by us ha ha!|`|c7667735aa54c174cb90c83107258ae4aa	Catalina would be a wonderful place for a one week honeymoon!|`|KMTiFxGqaa	I go to Catalina every year during the summer for a week with my family. I have been doing this for the past 15 years. There are plenty of things to do outdoors and plenty of shopping and dining. My suggestion is that you rent a house, not stay in a hotel. They have houses or condos for rent for reasonable prices. Check out catalinaislandvacationrentals.com. Staying in a home will give you two the space you need on your honeymoon and the freedom to do whatever you please on your vacation! Go on the tours too.  Another option for the non-flyer is a cruise. You must live in SoCal so take a look at the cruises from LA or San Diego. Some even stop in Catalina. Best wishes for your wedding!
73nTYgdraa	Exactly as my "friend" Rahul said, if you're gonna keep him to you with sex, he do not love you and you DON'T love him.  That's not a good way to keep up a relation ship. Rather let it go than try to keep it up with sex and watch you both fall apart.  You might as well keep having sex. Who knows? maybe you are for real.  Good luck and i hope everything goes well for you if you love each other.|`|lL3BzDslaa	You need to be on everything  Double condum protection and especially birth control for you...you never know when he might bust a nut in u.....  Trust me i know how you feel...i used to get pun like everday starting from march till september with my ex and gotten some on the side with all my girls that are friends...sex can get addicting but then it wears off    Control yourself, there is never a real reason for you to be that wild    And im a 17year old father with a 2 year old daughter i take care myself ever since the baby momma left...Trust lay off the sex and better yourself in life|`|LGHMmRVFaa	condoms are 99.9 percent effective even more when you are on the pill but tell your parents and stay with him if you love him no matter what they say|`|NEfezEUQaa	I'm sorry, but I don't think you two really love each other, you're just addicted.  Yes, it's bad to be addicted for such a reason.  It's a bad idea to go behind your parents' back and get birth control.  Ditto on the even having sex.  Very bad.  Aren't you underage?|`|pFcMVKMJaa	just one question..for how long are you planning to keep him tied to by sex. girl you are 15 love is not about sex may be its infatuation and it  will weary out but you got to be in love. if he loves you then why one girl not even a bunch of strippers can take him away from you. i think its just that you love sex and its alright but the cause for this sex is only satisfying the desire not keeping your love man cause he is not your love...i think you deserve someone better.  precaution is better than cure girl why take chances go for contraceptives you got a beautiful life ahead of you.  you know your parents well, if you can muster the courage to confront them on this issue go ahead they may put some sense into you...after who else is responsible for our lives other than us, ourselves.|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	your name says it all BabyK..your a baby having sex with a 18 year old.he obviously does not respect you enough to take chances of getting you pregnant..you both have no clue what you are doing..so stop it..if you have plans stick to them let him go have sex with whoever he wants..its going to happen anyways..not too many men are married to a girl they had sex with when they were 17 and she was 13.sorry its soo messed up and almost sounds illegeal..|`|DJwRCAFpaa	well first off once he turns 18 and you have sex, he will have just committed statutory rape which i believe is a crime in probably all states.  if you decide to keep having sex, keep the condoms on and if you want a plan b go on the pill. do not tell your parents if they are moral people because they will probably report him for the crime listed above    edit: double condom usage is actually more dangerous because the friction between the condoms makes each one weaker, making it more prone to breaking btw|`|W3uYB8JVaa	A relationship just based on sex will not last.  You are basically trying to throw yourself on him to keep him looking elsewhere.  If all he cares about is your body and not the real you then he does not respect you as a person, only an object.  Years from now you will wish you would have waited to give yourself to someone who really loves you for you, but you are too young and inexperienced right now to see this.

I have a really high pitched, childish voice too. I try not to go to any extreme (i.e scream or try to sing high) but really every voice is unique and special and they should accept that.|`|rbhJhe7paa	ermm.....   sorry but i don't think there's really any way to make your voice 'sweet'.  I think you're either born with a good voice or not.  I haven't got the best voice in the world either, you've just gotta accept how u are.  And you'r friends shouldn't be saying stuff like that, it makes you feel low about yourself.|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Practice, practice, practice. Haven't you seen Will and Grace. You know the woman who plays Karen. Her voice in the show is really high pitched, but if you ever see her in an interview her voice is much lower. These people who say that you can't change your voice are idiots. Try constricting the throat muscles more and speaking a little breathier. You can start by trying to act like a valley girl (in private please lol) and change it more everyday. Experiment with different ways of saying things. I used to have a really low voice, but with practice I've learned to sound a lot more girlie. Find the voice that suits you. Good luck
oGoWz511aa	He only called her those things to try to smooth things out, or try to calm you into believing nothing was going on between them.  If you already know you can't believe the things he says to you, you have to try not believe something he says just because it's what you want to hear.      Now... about the children.  You cannot control where he takes the children when they're with him.  It's as simple as that.  Take a deep breath, step back, and look at what's going on.  You don't want him to take the children to her place when they're with him.  He does it anyway.  Your children are going through a lot right now just by virtue of the fact that their parents are getting divorced.  Now they have the additional stress of feeling they either need to hide their father's activities, or lie to their mother.  They ONLY reason they feel this way is because of the pressure YOU are putting on them.  You don't want their father with this woman so you're subconsciously trying to control him by relegating what he does with the children during his visitation.      What you need to realize is, there may be A LOT of women their father's life now that he's going to be single.  Especially due to the fact that this relationship with a cheating spouse isn't likely to work out in the long run.  Please!  Try never to put your children in a position where they feel they either need to hide something from you, or lie to you.  It's not healthy for them emotionally.  Their father may be a flake, but that only makes it more important than ever that you are their safe, and stable parent.  If you ever feel the children are legitimately in harms way due to who their father brings them around, then it's your job to correct the situation.  If you're only doing it because you disapprove of who it is... well... you already see what it does to your children.      As your children grow older (and maybe even now) they'll make up their own minds about what kind of people each one of their parents are.  Your husband may have already sealed his fate with them.  Just make sure they don't grow up to think of you as the parent who stressed them out by making them take sides.|`|QIQNzE11aa	Do your kids a big favor. Tell them you are no longer upset. Tell the dad that if he chooses to take him to his girlfriends house, please do not tell the kids they need to lie about it.     You can't make him not go there, but you can help your kids by not making a huge deal out of it. I know it's hard not to be bitter and angry at him, and i am not saying you have to stop being angry. But, it's better if you learn to forgive him (not for him, but forgive him so that your life can improve. He never has to be told he's forgiven, this is just for you). Learn to forgive him and let this go for your kids sake. They are the one being hurt the most.    First, they had to lie for dad which caused them great pain. But they didn't lie so much for him, they lied to try to keep you happy. Then when they told the truth, they were hurt because you were angry. Now they are scared because he'll be angry and because you are still angry.     The kids should be allowed to still be friends with each other. None of the kids have anything to do with the adults. The kids won't be confused in the least. Kids always hear about someone's parent having an affair it and it ruining the entire family. It's the 2000's and it's everywhere. It would be more confusing to try to figure out what they did that means they can't be friends anymore. Let them be kids, let them like each other and play together. Again, it really only upsets you. It's not her fault he cheated and it's not your fault he cheated. Though i see he is trying to claim so. In the end... the only one at fault is him. I had a woman show my husband her breasts at work in the break room. He got up and left. She slipped him a note that she'd like to see him sometime after work. he took it to the boss and asked that she be spoken too. A man does not have to cheat no matter what. A good man never will. All the rest are lies and excuses perpetrated by men who want any excuse to cheat.     It doesn't matter why he has sex with this other woman. He chose too and that's the truth. You shouldn't compare or think about it further.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Question does your ex have a tattoo in his forehead that says "Loser"? if not maybe he should.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Get yourself and the kids into therapy tout suite!    This is the stuff strippers are made of.|`|AA10886262	you have no reason to feel badly about yourself, you are not the one that was caught cheating.....your husband and your best 'friend' (and I use the word friend loosely here) are the ones that have caused the problems.....look on the bright side, you managed to stay married for 11 years and that gets you half his pension and rights to draw on his social security.  I'm sorry you have to go through this, you deserve better than him!  File for divorce, but you do have to realize that you will have no control over whether he takes the kids to visit with her (it was really crappy of him to tell them to keep their mouths shut, really crappy - you don't put kids in the middle of your affair)....you will make it through this and be stronger for it....|`|B12E4rYiaa	It sounds like it's gone from bad to worse. It's time to regain stability in the kids' lives and yours. Seek counseling so you can get proper guidance and wisdom to handle your situation. Don't allow feelings to dictate your reactions.     No matter what hold your peace and do what's best for you and the kids. If he is willing to get counsel and you two want to work it out that would be best. If he's not then let him go.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Honey, get yourself and your kids into some counseling.  Your husband is a piece of dirt for doing this to you and it's played havoc on your self esteem, and you're lashing out in the wrong direction.      Talk to a counselor and take all that negative energy and focus it in ways that will help you and your kids move on and forget the piece of dirt you were married to.     I'm so sorry you're going through this...IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Get the divorce and move on|`|T6nvpX6zaa	A few things.  First, it is unlikely that you can keep your kids away from your soon-to-be-ex-husband's girlfriend.  The kids are most hurt by you and him not being together.  Regardless of who the other woman is, so I don't think it adds that much more confusion.  I wouldn't worry about it.    You should focus on the evidence you can present your lawyer if he is not willing to settle the divorce on terms you want, since he is the guilty party.    But mostly, you should focus on not giving a rat's behind what this adulterer thinks of you.  Who cares?  I know it is hard, because you loved him and he is the father of your children.  However, he is an adulterer, so what he thinks shouldn't matter one bit.  You should find a solid man who wants to love someone, and see what he thinks of you.  But people who have the character of scum?  Don't worry for a second about what they think of you.    Sorry for the trouble you're feeling!|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	Your marriage was over before you moved back home. Now it's really over. You need to not look at what he said about this girl, he said it so you wouldn't think anything was happening w/him and her. He is now choosing her. There is not much you can do except make it as easy for your children as possible.  Don't ever put them in the middle. If they are comfortable being at her house  then leave it alone. They're kids, they will probably see it as being able to play with friends. If you tell them that dad wasnt' supposed to have them there then it's a problem. same if he tells them don't tell mom. He obviously is going to be there. even though he said he wouldn't, things are different now, so make it work for the kids. She's not a complete stranger, be glad about that.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Get some therapy for you and your children and move on with your life.  It's terrible that you were betrayed not only by your husband but by your best friend too.  That is so harsh!  I'm sorry.  Stay away from them both and never look back.  You are better off without either of them.  Good luck.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Get your divorce and also supervised visits for your ex-husband to be.  You put up with enough bullshit from him in the process of trying to work things out.  You deserve better and so do your kids.  lieing, cheating bastard.  Good luck.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Get out.  Stay out.  Tell the truth to your kids, and be totally open with them.  Your 'job' is to love them, protect them, and take care of them. Do that.  Live your life.  He's a cheat, a liar, and a deceitful man.  He's demonstrated poor judgement and hurtful, injurious behavior towards YOU and HIS CHILDREN.  Keep it to yourself- but your kids will figure it out too.  Life is short.  Move on!  Pursue the things you love to do- and enjoy the time with your children. You can't protect them from jerks like their father, but you yourself can DO the right thing, and LIVE right.|`|vm1Fj2AVaa	I can't believe what men will do. This is just going to have to play out and it's going to hurt. He's gonna want you back one of these days. My husband did something very similar to my stepdaughter. He took her to his mistresses house when I kicked him out one night and he slept in her room with the door closed and left his stepdaughter slept on the couch. I can't even imagine what was going on in her mind as she lay there on the couch while her dad cheats on our marriage of 11 years. She may be my stepdaughter but I've been with him since she was 1 and have raised her with 100% custody for over 5 years now. She finally told me because she didn't like what her dad did to me. She finally got so mad at her dad that she told me I could tell him everything she told me. Since all this, my stepdaughter has been having nasty sex chats with boys on the computer and other promiscuous and rebellious stuff. She is only 12. The damage this stuff does to the kids sticks with them for life. You need to tell him that you found out another way...make something up. And tell him it's unacceptable and you're not going to allow him to destroy these kids lifes just because he wants to be a selfish a**. This stuff makes me so mad and it disrupts so many innocent lives.|`|i9nlUZb0aa	First off, I'm sorry to say, but your husband hasn't just done it that one day he was doing it sooner. So, when you get your divorce make sure you get him for cheating. Secondly you are right. He should never have involved the kids at this time. So you need to tell him that you know what he did, that you didn't like it especially when he already agreed that now was not the right time and thirdly to ask the kids to lie for you was the worst thing he could have done. Then you need to let him know that if you cant trust him to do the right things with the children then you will make sure he gets supervised visits until he can go to parenting classes. That your business with him is the children and that is what you guys need to focus on and what he does when he is not with the kids is of no concern nor do you care anymore what or where he goes or who he is with. I hope things work out for you and your children. Good-luck
nWGgaQdhaa	i'd say that if it's everytime she walks by you then, she may be doing something to keep from acting like an idiot. or she's trying to get your attention. or another possible explanation is that she was texting a friend saying something like OMG!!! there he is, he is SOOOOO hot... i dont know it could be a variety of things. good luck...|`|5d5t1Rpeaa	im thinking shes doing something so she does have to look at you? or maybe shes addicted to texting?

P4Jc76GPaa	Anytime you have a relationship with someone and they bring up their ex's or other sexual relationships, then it's a bad thing. He's treating you with disrespect. You did the right thing by telling him that you don't like it and you shouldn't. Although it's only been a month you need to set ground rules. Now is a good time to start. Both of you need to sit down and decide what is appropriate and what's not. Usually when a guy brags like this, they are usually lying or adding more to the story. Good luck.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	And YOUR the one that can't be trusted? I DON'T THINK SO! You tell him if he wants to be a sugar daddy then go ahead but you don't need his bull! You deserve better than that and you don't have to stand for it!|`|YtSGbYqEaa	usually when a man doesnt believe you or says he doesnt trust you its because hes doing something wrong himself and he might be doing it with the girls he talks about you shouldnt be with a man like that find a respectful man who shows he trust you and only thinks of you...you cant have a healthy relationship with out trust be strong hes no good leave him|`|eqWftUQeaa	I would say kick his @ss to the curb. He sounds like a total loser anyway.
dNujGVBzaa	I suggest to be abit different, have you thought about planting notes around the house with envelopes with a rose petal. Each note directs her to another location. In the envelopes you could have different little things - like 1 peice of candy, another rose petal, sticker to say I love you, little things make the most impression. You dont need to spend big on valentines day. At the end of your destination of placing your envelopes as she/he looks for them - You could make up your own poem, do a picture of you both doesnt matter if you cant draw, the point is the thought is there, be creative.  eg to what to write on the pieces of paper - first one hand it to her/him, saying Hi i'm the cupid fairy and I was asked to help on your behalf but I havent quite finished my romance school yet because I play up and love adventure lets have some fun.. (describe the area where she/he needs to go.) eg go into the kitchen, look for something red, hot,cool. dont give your place away make her/him look for it.   at the final envelope place it to where he/she was orignally.   remember you can sticky tape the envelops to the bottom of the tables, keep it out of sight so it doesnt ruin the suprise.|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Try sleepin wid her
Lfc9Zav2aa	Sounds like they are not considering your feelings. You should let them know how you feel.
i5jNl2Cuaa	The following only applies if you are 18 or older. If you are younger than 18 you will regret having had sex before this very young age when you are older. . .    You can't go wrong with a skirt and tank top.    1. They're sexy    2. They're a lot easier to manage then pants when undressing prior to sex.    Wear a nice thong (see-through/lace) and bra (that shows some clevage). Also some nice smelling perfume (just 1 squirt) and a necklace would be a nice touch.    Now go make some babies! Jk, have him wear protection!|`|evJ2GEodaa	The best thing would be to wear    NOTHING!|`|LGHMmRVFaa	nothing lol|`|f848f2bd049ab143a6b0f7c8ef72e5d1aa	wear nothing duh!!|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	Doesn't really matter, since it won't be on long.

In 1 or 2 in both case it is important. So first ask him. No not directly. Start from here.(1) Your house is big isn't it. So many rooms.How do you live. So if he is busy talking of rooms he wants sex? (2) Your mummy will see me she will throw me out. If he talks regularly about mummy, He is intrested in introducing to mother. (3) The last At what time. If morning or evening it means family memebe will be there So U can try. if afternoon or night Be careful.  Girls are to be careful by herself. No other can help u.

For any relationship it is essential that both the partners understand the thought, rationale behind what somebody is asking for or doing..  All the best

WOW...|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	no but you could have a chance with boys.|`|m31vJe5xaa	If you've already had two women like that, I'm pretty sure there's a lot more who can satisfy you. Look at all the girls with the other really weird fetish's, I'm sure you can find plenty like the last two. It may take some time, but you eventually will.|`|OR5PhU40aa	There's always a chance, and you're lucky because foot fetishism is fairly common.    A woman will do a lot to ensure that her lover will stay with her, and this includes indulgence. Good luck!|`|YyFexhd3aa	what is your bloody question .? you want to find a woman with a feet i think you can find although its rare nowadays|`|5N1rEjiqaa	Yes  www.footlovers.com|`|N8kxg8wgaa	urr freak who likes feet?  why don't you be normal and like boobies and such|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	You're sick.|`|TAh77GR8aa	faking aso u love feet look and love the pusy dwag|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Depends on how wierd you are about it...I mean no offense, but if I was just getting to know someone and all he talked about was feet, or wanted to touch my feet, Id not see him again. You have to curb your lust towards feet a bit. Its not all about you. Try to go to 'feet forums' if you want...if its that bad a fetish where you have to have feet available to you in a relationship.....but its up to you on how to present it to a person....you still have a chance, everyone does.....|`|NEfngXeXaa	why do u like feet?|`|rB8jM04Laa	yeah as long as its not all about there feet, te he !  of course , why wouldnt you? wats wrong with you  ? te he  xx yeah i think everyone has a secret little thing like that, not such a big deal realy xxx

Z7KRAzbeaa	It's difficult to understand if you are friends then surely you've talked about guys you like and the kind of guy you like, which obviously he can figure out that it doesn't sound like it describes him.  I know lots of guys over the years, and I can say that they would want to know whether or not they are wasting their time with you.  You can casually say "I am so glad we are friends".  Use the words "friends" often.  When you do him a favor say "that's what friends are for".  Pay sometimes when you go somewhere.  Say "my turn, we're friends".  He will get it.  DO NOT flirt with him.  Do not touch him.  If you still think after all of this that he has a big crush on you, then I believe you need to do the difficult thing and not be with him very much.  What agony for him.  I think it is almost inhumane to a woman to string a guy along for her own convenience and pleasure.|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	Give really obvious hints that you are just friends.|`|DJwRCAFpaa	as long as youre not encouraging his behavior you should be ok. no flirting, leading him on, etc|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	You just need to be honest with him. He has to know he don't have a shot with you so he can move on.|`|AGbusTqGaa	You just have to be honest with him, tell him that you really want to be friends with him but you are not interested in a serious relationship.  Also let him know that you had no intentions of leading him on and apologize if that's how he feels.|`|gN9Kc2q7aa	honesty in the best policy really. tell him that there is not chance of a relationship. If you continue to put it off, he may feel that there is hope and then will be more upset when he finds out that no relationship will ever happen. explain that you like him as a friend and thats all you want right now.|`|m31vJe5xaa	haha, trust me there is no way to break it to him easily. I've had this happen plenty of times, you just have to tell him that you don't quite feel the same way as him but that you love being friends with him and love being around him. Tell him all the stuff you like about him and how good a friend he is, but that that's all you feel right now.  He will get upset and maybe mad, but he will get over it trust me.  Like I said before, let him down easy, tell him all the good stuff but then give him the bad news in there too.    Hope this helps :)|`|2iXOaVQoaa	Meh, I'm kind of on the opposite side of that.  I'm the guy that likes the girl.  But she likes me only as a friend.  We dated off and on for about a year, but now she wants to be just friends and wants to be able to think about things.    She kind of put it flat out that we are just friends and I just kind of accepted it, knowing that I could still talk to her and be with her like normal.  I still like her, she knows that, but we don't talk as anything more than friends anymore.
sEFmjAJkaa	Well you just answered your own question....    You were tired of ALL THE ARGUING!!!!   Why stay in that type of relationship.    Better to end it now....... so you both can get past it..   V-D means almost nothing anymore, it's a MAN MADE HOLIDAY, for idiots to spend money on their bf or gf just for this man made holiday.    You don't sound ready to settle down, AT LEAST not with this woman!    Time to start looking for another woman......but take some time for yourself, so you don't go on the REBOUND.... which really sucks!|`|eAc67eoYaa	sounds like shes jus tryin to have some fun before she comes ack to you.  who knows what she could be or doing or even worse, who...  it sounds like you need to move on.  may not be what you want at all. but it may be for the best. is it?|`|t0uIgY08aa	Valentines day is an over rated holiday that people made up to get noticed in their relationship. Usually distance makes the heart grow fonder. So if your not missing her, and wanting her back, then really It needs to be over, before you lead her on, and or yourself on and get in a bigger hole than what your really wanting to be in. Breaking up with someone on Christmas or before is Messed up but Valentines day is stupid. Another thing you can still make her feel good by sending her a Rose as a Friend.. Anyway you should just end things and go your seperate ways.|`|DS3QXmTBaa	Leave the *****.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	mate dont ring her go and see her .that way she knows you want her .more then a call. go for it ..|`|AGbusTqGaa	I don't think there is really a time frame for something like this.  If you are over the relationship all the time in the world wouldn't make you change your mind.  It is a crappy time to break up but you need to do whats best for you.  If you're ready to settle down you shouldn't be wasting your efforts on someone who isn't.  That sounds really harsh buut thats the way it goes sometimes.  I hope that helps and that everything works out for you!|`|ecNeN0staa	Go find someone else, you deserve it.  Nothing quite like the feel of something new!|`|Q8amh0rUaa	turn it around on her.  After she starts to talk to you tell her you have found someone else.  and make her mad.  Move on!!!|`|lUO6wLGAaa	I'm doing some thinking too.  I think it's already over.  She hasn't contacted you, and you don't want to be with her, so what's left to figure out?|`|iT4gn3z8aa	I would call it quits. If you have doubts right now, they won't get better with time. There's an old saying when you're dating someone;    Take your problems that you have now, and multiply them by 3 times. That's what it will be like when you're married.     This is true. I can speak from experience. Months of marriage counseling has helped, but being single, you have the luxury of waiting for someone who you're 100% happy with.|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	you should give her a call..and talk about it..ask her seriously if she will get back with you..you dont want to pressure her..but you know ask her because you been thinking about the same things..and that your not sure what to do if shes not..and if the both of you are not ready to make a move..then just leave it alone..and if you guys arent going out by valentimes day..just still buy her atleast a box of chocolates it will make her feel happy and special..  :)  good luck!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If she needs to think about it that much that's not a good sign.    If you are thinking of throwing in the towel that's not a good sign.    Give up and move on.|`|AA11309717	I have a friend who is in a somewhat similar situation to yours. She doesn't get to spend much time with her guy because he travels a lot. He promised her he'd contact her at least once a week while he was away. Long story short she hasn't heard from him since dec 8th of last year. (no merry christmas no happy new year, nothing) This has given  her time to think about things and she has decided that rather than actually throwing in the towel she is meeting new people with the idea that if he ever contacts her again the 2 of them will discuss it then. In the meantime she is going on with her life and meeting lots of new people.    I believe truly that this is your opportunity to go out and meet new people. Don't ever close the door completely but keep on looking and don't worry about about your girl if she gets back to you then you can discuss what needs to be discussed then. I say this because it doesn't really sound like you want to be with her anyway. This also might be her way of thinking to herself but not saying to you "I'm not ready to settle down or you aren't the one I want to settle down with"    Get out meet people and have fun!|`|szVvf7Nkaa	This relationship does not seem to promising at all. If you were already thinking about breaking up with her then yes you need to do some thinking on your own. And do you really want to be in a relationship where you constantly argue all the time. I think you really need to think about what you really want to do. I also think you need to forget that Valentine is just around the corner. And it does take more then one week to sort out feelings. If your girlfriend has to take time apart from you then she is not certain about her feelings for you. I think you need to ask yourself if you are going to be able to trust her feelings for you if she does decide to go back to you.|`|XqDTyY6Yaa	this realy doesn make sence|`|FHRfTlCxaa	Well,if you don't really want to be with her,why go out with her..|`|RTojCgVPaa	i'd say 2 weeks at an absolute maximum. but even though you think the ball is in her court she is taking time to think but it means you can think too. it's both of your relationships not just hers and you have a right to think and call it quits if you want too. arguments is a good reason.|`|yoNyPfMraa	2-3 wks is a fair guess i think|`|fKedbYR4aa	Hey brother..    It wouldn't hurt to just give her a call and have a talk with her. Tell her you're tired of waiting around. Just be honest with her. Feel out the conversation, and see where it takes you. I mean, usually, when someone says they want some time to think about things, they've already made their mind. If you're tired of waiting, just let her know. The worst that can happen is you guys will break up, big deal. Like i said, just be honest, and talk it out with her. Maybe you will both decide you're better off moving on, or maybe you guys will decide you can't move on. Just talk to her.|`|62d419570572377e88e6cca8cc106a30aa	It sounds like y'all are done.  I would just call her and say, you've been doing some thinking, too, and you should just make a clean break.    Also, on a side note, do not put stock in Valentine's Day.  It's a ridiculous holiday.  And I'm not one of those lonely, bitter people who say that because they're sad.  I've been married to my high school sweetheart for years, and if love someone you don't only express it one day of the year because Hallmark and jewlery stores tell you you're supposed to.  It's just another day.|`|9CCXPGXqaa	a week is not long enough.  sometimes we as women just get our emotions tangled up.  give her a few more days and then try calling her.  send her flowers on V-day anyway and if your the one debating on if you should get back together or not then let her know that.  that way you will both be on the same page.  Honesty is important in this situation and just sitting down and being able to talk about things.  If you can't talk to her, then it's not going to work anyway so you mid swell stop wasting your time.|`|NQ97Q1gkaa	A week? thats not that much,but how old are you two?    You should think if u love her and think about what if you stay together what would happen,do you think she will be willing to work it out,and talk to her tell her what you want and how you feel just be straight up,and seeing what she says back then u make a decision.    You dont have to care about valenties if you want someone and u break up,any day is gonna hurt the same.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	You had your doubts before due to the constant arguing. You are having doubts now. I'd say get on with your life. Stop thinking that you messed up. Good luck!|`|MWjNp6y3aa	If you are ready to settle and she isn't then I would move onto a stable girl. You aren't married and she has left you. Unless you have a kid with her then leave. Trust me...it will be worse if you marry a girl like that. Just hang out with buddies or something valentines day. Get wasted play video games, movies, etc. Just keep occupied. It will suck but maybe you will find another woman on Valentines day that is looking for a nice man too.|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	call her up ask her what happening val day and ask to go on a date dont bring nothing up on the date and then after the date ask her to call u next time she wants to see u make sure tho u make it like it was when u first met each other that will bring her back then wait 3 to 4 days call her up ask what she would like to do then while r out tell her u love her and ask her whats happening between use not past future wise if she still wants to b with u take the next step and she will go crazy for ya :) hope it all works out|`|r7sgshwKaa	Valentine's Day is just another day. If all you do is argue with your partner why would you want to be with them anyway? Love shouldn't be about arguing, it should be about loving that person. Sure you may have differences but you shouldn't be arguing on a regular basis. If you aren't on the same page, then I suggest you move on. I bet you feel good not having headaches from all that arguing huh?  I personally would rather walk away from a person than to argue. Life is way too short for all that crap. You had a legitimate reason for cooling things off with her so unless you want your future to be revolving around this again I suggest you find a replacement.|`|Jzo2cm15aa	Give her her space. Valentines Day don't mean a thing. It's not like it's a special day you both made up like an anniversary. Think about what you want to do not what she wants. If you are ready to settle down make sure she is the one for you before you regret it and end up worse off. If she doesn't come back around do something for yourself on Valentines Day. Time is on your side not her's you know  Good Luck|`|AA10364849	Hello,    Valentine's Day is just another day. Don't let the marketing folks fool you on that.     If the two of you were fighting before, is taking time off going to change that? You are feeling the relationship cooling off, she is remaining silent.     There is a reason it's called a break up. It's because it's broken. Some relationships can be worked out with more communication. Some relationships are broken beyond repair. This is something that only you can decide for yourself.     Hang in there, I am in the same boat so I understand your point.|`|x1Jh7sCoaa	she's torturing you for hurting her    she'll let you know about a week b4 valentine's if she wants to be with you (she'll want to give you nuff time to arrange v-day romancing)    meantime do what she's doing - see what else is out there

If he gets to irate about it, something is going on. If he wont show you, something is going on. Dont accuse him flat out, but ask him why he blocked you, why you cant see his page-info. Or get a friend of yours, or make a fake page ( i did this ) and start talking to him, so you have PROOF of him cheating, if he is....start out normal with him, then you can ' get to know him' better as the fake person.

Christian homes are not the only homes that are capable of raising respectful, moral children.  3.  I am an Agnostic w/a Hindu husband  and I am a stay at home Mom raising our 3 sons.  I also consider our family "normal".  4.  I have nothing against the Duggar family per se (I've watched their shows and bought their book).

I'll send you my address, endorse it over to me.|`|4POGapREaa	I understand that those are your wishes but it would be INCREDIBLY rude to destroy their check.  I'm sure they knew that gifts weren't necessary but they wanted to do that for you regardless so sending it back would be really disrespectful, almost like saying we don't need your money, thanks but no thanks.  Just send them a card & tell them how appreciative you are.|`|woOeYFrEaa	Why don't you simply send it to your favorite charity.  I think you'll offend the person if you try to return it or simply never cash it.  Thank the person and tell them how you used the funds.    We didn't want gifts either and set up some "charity registries" that several of our guests did send money to in our honor but we also got gift cards and other traditional wedding presents.|`|AA11312653	Call the couple and thank them for their generosity. Offer to return their check and if they decline, tell them that you would like to donate their gift to charity, and that you wish for them to choose the charity. Then make the donation in their name and arrange for the charity to thank this couple for their gift. You also send a handwritten thank you letter to the couple telling them how pleased you are to know that their generosity toward you is now helping buy books for children in Mexico, save endangered species, distribute Bibles, or whatever.     This is a great question. I wish Miss Manners knew of a really effective way to say "no gifts" without committing the rudeness of presuming on guests' generosity.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Do not return the check to the gift giver, that would not be polite.  Accept it graciously and write them a thank you note.  If you don't want or need it, then donate it to someone who does.      Also you shouldn't make any mention of gifts on the invitations whatsoever, even if it's to say you don't want any.  To make a reference to gifts is pretentious on the hosts part.  Saying that you don't want gifts on the invitation is the same as putting registry info on it, they both say that you're expecting gifts.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	it would be rude to return the check, because it kinda makes  it seem like "your money is no good to us".      perhaps what you could do instead is cash/deposit the check, then donate it to a charity of your choosing? or several? perhaps if you know of a charity that is near and dear to the couple who sent you the checks heart you could donate some to that charity?|`|Muoe8lQtaa	i don't think that you should return it cause that's like a slap in the face.  why don't you just donate it if you really don't want it.|`|AA11138696	I agree with the idea of giving it to your favorite charity.  You can send then a note to let them know what you did with the money.

uBssj3Znaa	if you were broken up then it shouldn't matter. You weren't together at the time so he could do whatever and whoever he wanted. Get over it.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	The most important thing now is what you think the kind of man he is. Sometimes it's not even about being blinded when you're in love but what the guy does everyday to show and proove you that he would never lie or cheat behind your back. You need to be certain of that and this is what will keep the relationship strong in order to go through this dilemna.  Let me explain this to you.     I have been on and off for 5 years too with a man. We have absolute trust for each other and that's what helped us go through it. During all our breakups we were still very close, talkin to each other everyday etc and he was pushing me to move forward and meet someone which I did. I even slept with the guy but then I realized he was playing me and i left him. My ex then took me back and now we are more commited to each other than we've ever been. It is awefully hard for him to accept it that i slept with another person, he keeps picturing it and all and although I feel horrible, we are 100% communicating about it. He tells me when he's sad/mad and I try to be here and supportative and talk about it although it brings me back bad memories but i do it to help him and us. Although we weren't together i feel i cheated on him as we were close still and he feels so too.    If your man sound slike a honest and reliable guy, ask him to help you get over it. Him avoiding the talks about that girl is bad for you both if you want it to work; He has to make that sacrifice and make it up to you. You weren't together but for the sake of your 5 years together he owes you explanation, support, love, lots of self control to not get mad etc. He has to STOP talking to that girl too|`|0udjgaoBaa	Y'all werent together and you should be used to this by now....why do you guys keep breaking up? Do you ever feel like you are wasting your time with him?|`|v2D4Sao5aa	dont get back togethere with him he will think you'll easy to mess around with dont give him that chance dont get back togethere with him ok|`|ks2oieV0aa	You were broken up at the time!?!  xox|`|AaoLwJJWaa	well u gotta deal with it, the dude did nothing wrong, he's ovbiously not gonna wait around for you if yall were broken up|`|faOBk7qtaa	It isn't cheating if you were not together, so I don't know what the problem is other than you keep breaking up. Doesn't sound like the relationship is working anyways.|`|VCRP9efqaa	u kinda just gotta get past it because   he did nothing wrong because he wasnt  with u wen he messed around with those other girls.|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	yeah get it out of your head..you were not together..he did nothing wrong..unless he breaks up with you..too hook up guilt free|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Did you mess around with anyone while you were broken up?       Take a look at what you did, not him.        That usually relieves it.|`|TOei73dbaa	You should really let it go because if you weren't with him you had no claim to him, so its really his choice whether he does stuff  or not. there isn't really a point in worrying about it cause it will just mess up the relationship you have now. Hope i helped. Good luck.|`|7sxGW40qaa	GET OVER IT!  It was you guys's own fault that you broke up and he is allowed to do whatever the hell he wants while u 2 are not together.  Just don't think about it.  Or just stop breaking up.  Or don't get back together.|`|r7sgshwKaa	If the two of you were broken up when he kicked it with someone else you can't be upset about that. You may not like it but you can't hold that against him. Really, hes a dude. Unless he was wearing a priest collar when you broke up what did you expect him to do? Find somebody else if you can't get this image out of your mental Rolodex.|`|0f7849dcb48dc489f8d3b3b73332e378aa	I have been in your spot and I know how much your hurting!   I realized that he only broke up with me as to say "I never cheated on you!" but truth is I felt that he did and that he knew I was always going to be there waiting for him because I loved him too much as we been together 5 years like you and him.     I took till the third time he did this that I finally cut him off. Believe me it was hard and the pain was like nothing I felt before, I always thought about calling him and saying I am sorry. But i deleted his number and changed mine. Moved out of my place to a shared flat and made new friends.     I heard he tried everything to find me and he went in to depression.    Am I am so glad I did this. It's been 2 years now and I although I am not in a serious relationship at the moment but getting to know two really great guys.     I realized that the 5 years I spent with my ex I was only lying to myself that I loved him.     You have to let go of him. He doesn't deserve you at all!!!|`|LXsxmp3Faa	first all you and your boyfriend were broken up meaning you and him were no longer together. second he has the right to go with anyone that he wants to go withso you cant tell him who and who not to go wit. Its your decision to decide if yall wanna stay together, but if you constantly cant get the thought out your head maybe this is sign that you need to move on and really find somebody else.
CkpzuduCaa	hmm 19 75 or 76. to a away hs fb game.|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	when i dated your mom.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	a long long time ago!:)|`|5N1rEjiqaa	1942|`|e1hA0pVJaa	IF DIDN'T KNOW I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON FOR CARING ABOUT ANYBODIES FEELINGS EXPECALLY WOMEN!

MWjNp6y3aa	Tell her. Or try to never do it again. But it will eat at you if you don't tell all.    Say "Honey, I cheated on you. Wait wait..let me finish...I cheated and feel bad. I know I should feel bad. I hurt you and shouldn't have. I am telling you because it was eating my soul alive. Most girls will leave a guy for this and I wouldn't blame you if you did. I love you honey and am very sorry for what I have done."    Then you walk away...let her follow you if she wants you to stay and talk. Give her the opportunity to realize you are sorry and would like to patch things up. If you make it then she will know you can tell the truth even when it is going to bite you in the ***.    You probably won't have a gf anymore but you won't eventually if you hide it. It will catch up to you. All things do. If you tell her exactly what I said you might get away with a patched up relationship. Otherwise dude...your screwed.|`|nr1Bt47baa	Nothing because you don't deserve her. In other words there is nothing you can say really. You messed up, just learn from your mistakes.|`|eqWftUQeaa	YOU CAN TELL HER THAT YOU CHEATED ON HER, AND ADMIT THAT YOU ARE A DOG. AND HOPEFULLY SHE WILL LEAVE YOUR @SS.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	let it go. find an other gf and never cheat again.  because if your gf is now asking here if she should get back with you, every one will tell her that if some one cheats on you, he will keep doing it. no mater how much he "says" he is sorry.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	mate she ..going to be mad at you for a long time .. try to get her with you more so you dont do it again ..|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	slap her|`|0HO8sTGeaa	you s**k... just get out from her life.... you don't deserve her |`|Fh76mMuUaa	wow. just say sorry. what you mean. if u cant think of anything then you dont mean it.|`|VnRECJJxaa	you can't eve make up for that, she'll never trust you again and she shouldn't , you obviously dont really care about your girlfriend or her feelings,you screwd youraself and if she ends it she has every right to and you should leave her alone    nothing hurts worse then being cheated on,|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	everybody messes up. but unfortantly for you  most women can forgive, but not take you back. I think you should tell the truth say your sorry, then do the right thing and watch her walk away. she deserves better and you know that, so don't say anything but I cheated and I'm sorry, don't ask her to take you back, it's not fair.|`|ZJsjD4JHaa	if you were real than you would tell her how you feel about the situation and just say sorry dont beg.|`|4Ydn2d9waa	wow. well first off..  can you promise yourself you would never cheat on her again? if you cant just appologize and say you cant risk hurting her again and say she deserves better.  if you can promise yourself you would never cheat on her again, then i think the best thing to do is look her in the eye, and tell her exactly what you feel.  if she accepts your apology you are a avery lucky man XD  good luck mate.
tL2U34kraa	well you need to figure it out because you are already leading him on, and you don't want to hurt him. why are you telling him you just want to be friends but then doing the opposite like holding hands cuddling and sending signals you want to be kissed, he is probably thinking you like him now.if you changed your mind and want a relationship that's fine but if you don't know then don't keep on leading him on.you need to figure out what you want.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think if you don't want it to lead to anything more, then you stop being physical.|`|03GQ637Raa	If u want to remain only friends, then stop all physical contact with him except a slight hug.  Ur friend might be getting mixed signals or he is basking in your arms eevery timehe can.  Men have their 'FEELINGS" on the outside, while us women have ours on he inside.  Know that all that hugging and cuddling is gonna turn him on.  So the choice is yours, be his gf or be his friend.  U can be hurting him without even knowing it.|`|ZZ18Iwuoaa	Well I know how it is to be the guy wanting a relationship with a friend or friends in my case... It sounds to me like you are fighting the idea of having a relationship with him why?  Do you want a purely friend with benefits relationship?  If you are uninterested in him relationship wise you should tone down the physical-ness of the relationship.  What you need to decide is do you want to spend the rest of your life with this person as a friend or something more.  Understand that your friend has put some of the most intimate feelings a person can have towards you and not towards the millions upon millions of other girls out there.  Respect his feelings and do not undermine them.  But figure out how you feel and tell him.  You need to clearly communicate how you feel.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	i feel u want to be with him and dont want to loose him...just dat u have problems accepting this reality....give everything a thought..if u still think u r not into him..stop getting physical with him...!!
og060QfZaa	Well, try to talk to the owners of the place where you live in.|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Please don't write all such girl crap here.
ZzEAc5ecaa	hope it works out for you .. good luck|`|sP98NDi5aa	Did something happen to him? People don't normally change without some dramatic event happening to them. I fear that his promise to change is an empty one to keep you around. Give him a chance, let him know this is the last one, and keep options open about other guys.   This pain may be bad, and I feel for you, but there are few things more painful than regret.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	If you have pain, he did something to YOU, so why are YOU looking for a poem> Is this for yourself?? Make him beg and grovel and plead and kiss your butt IF you are going to forgive whatever he did. If he cheated, dump his ***. Depends on what the prob was.....|`|GfG4PfjMaa	I trusted you and gave you my heart  and now our relationship has fallen apart  what happened to the loved we shared  Is it gone forever, or is it still here    That flicker of hope I see in your eyes  makes me forgive you for all of your lies  It may even make me give you one last try  But will you appreciate me this time    My heart hurts and the pain is still raw  Don't rush me to decided, I'm not the one flawed  If you promise can I believe you this time  Or is it just you got caught and are given me a line    It is said once bitten twice you're shy  I hope you know you made me cry  Don't fret, I'm strong and yes love is still here  Although I've cried my eyes out with tears    This time you need to get it right  I'm not going to spend another tearful night  Thinking about if you are doing me wrong  For if I even suspect you, baby I'm gone
SBMxJdyraa	thats coz u r a little possesive nd u don't want her 2 go nd leave u alone.............u lyk her as a frnd nd u r a bit protective as u r a guy nd u care 4 her tats y don lyk her tokin 2 oder ppl much...........nd perhaps u cant do nething bcoz if u say sumthing she wont lyk it so.............i think evn u shud make new frnds...........nd its nuthin lyk love so dont worry........|`|pNqjsJn7aa	dude...she is ur friend and not ur gf!! even if she was ur gf..being so possessive is not a very good idea....just give her some space.....and involve urself in something else..
0HO8sTGeaa	give him a hint|`|xJBJn6dOaa	He could be staring at you because he noticed you staring at him... and he could be trying to figure out the same thing that you are. It's tough to say if he is interested, but if you like him... you should try talking to him and then you will have a better idea if he likes you or not.|`|71yXXY3eaa	He is probably confused at the attention you give to him and is unsure of how to proceed.  He probably is unsure how much he would like you and how much you like him.  You have never given any other signs to him about your attractions to him other than eye contact which is simply not enough for him.  It would probably elevate a lot of confusion if you went ahead and confronted him with more direct gesticulations.|`|CUUjvakpaa	yes he does|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	no|`|lTbZeGiYaa	Hm, im sorry but i dont think he'd like you just because of 'eye contact' I think for him to start liking you, you'd have to talk etc? Why dont you try talk to him, get his email, number or something.. :)|`|Y2sDswLBaa	You really cant no for sure until you talk to him.|`|3sGtibk5aa	Thats normally a guy sign that he likes you.  Write him a letter :-)|`|QdIwuRRVaa	if youve never talked to him that forget those little signs.  i mean maybe he could like you who am i to say he doesnt  but if he did want to be with you hed at least have enough guts to say something to you    you sound young move on and if he wants you he will come for you :]
goe3y4FPaa	its all ''Confidence'' bro.. who cares if ur fat.. its gonna take several months go get in shape.. if u just wait.. into u get in shape.. to ask her out.. and if shes popular and hot.. chances are.. other guys are chasing her.. just ask her.. is she says ''Yes'' u could get in shape.. while dating her.. on the side.. if she says ''No''  get  in shape.. and ask anyone u want out.. if u still want to ask her go ahead.. but u have to seem like ur not a ''loser'' and have other girls on ur mind.. not just her.. that way.. she knows she has competiion and will want u more..|`|sl0Z4lTSaa	work out|`|AaoLwJJWaa	here's what you do, you ask her out first. then if she says no, then you spend the next year totally hiding from her, and meanwhile working out and transforming urself, and when she sees you all sexified she'll melt and feel guilty|`|xJBJn6dOaa	hit the gym and get sexified. it will not only make you look better, but your confidence and self-esteem will sky rocket.|`|5F224cRzaa	Pray to god shes not shallow|`|oMXlbWu9aa	Either lose weight or find another fatty to go out with, you've no chance with a hottie, sorry!|`|4LYasBGXaa	just ask her-    be funny- humor is key.      however- for your own health and well-bieng, you will live a better life and healthier one if you are not fat.    learn proper nutrition and excercise (your eating habits are the primary key- excercise is secondary but a very helpfull supplement).
71yXXY3eaa	You should make it clear to him in both word and deed that you regret saying the statement you made.  Do something special for him that you know he likes.  Above all, be patient.  Because by being inpatient you just prolong the message to him that you are upset and dissatisfied with him.|`|8FO52r0Maa	I don't understand what he is pissed off about it's not like you told him he has a little winkie or anything, just let him sulk for awhile he'll get over it|`|cGGvZqJNaa	He sounds immature. Tell him to grow up or you are leaving.|`|AA11328507	He is a big baby...I mean its the truth so why is he upset?  He needs to grow up!|`|cmFU81rQaa	For people who don't understand, she made it sound like a big favor to be ******* his dick.  Anyway, tell him what you told us more or less.  Especially the paragraph you added after the fact.|`|0jyJ6Utjaa	Stop apologizing.  He will either get over it or he won't.  He was being a S*** too.  If you stop trying so hard he might respond faster....men are infants at times.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	making love isn't your problem.  Being willing to be so malicious and hurtful to each other is your problem.  You need to learn to not fight back.  Sure, he needs to learn not to be hurtful - absolutely right!  But you can't control him, you can only control you.    So go to him and simply say, "Honey, I am really sorry I insulted you.  I felt hurt and that is never a good enough excuse to insult you.  You work so hard for this family and you deserve more respect than I give you.  Will you please forgive me?"  When he says yes, tell him "I don't ever want to fight back when you are upset.  I am really going to work at listening to you instead of fighting with you."    Maybe you can get "The Love Dare" and start doing that.  If it is worse than you imagined, maybe you can start seeking counseling to help you overcome.    I know it is hard to do, but unconditional love is the only thing that can make marriages great!|`|e7dAJAA6aa	My advice would be to not force him to talk about the issue. Just go down on him to make him feel that you doing that is something that you enjoy doing and it's not something that you just do to make him feel happy. Maybe that's what he's upset about- maybe he feels that you feel doing that is a chore.|`|yy45iAbtaa	forgives you.you need to forgive him.go about your days and waite for an apology from him.that is what you do you did nothing wrong.that is what wrong with woman today you make men turn it around and make us think it is our fault for what happens in the relationship.remember it takes 2 not 1 in a relationship to start one and to end one.so don't waite fo him you will never get one just forget about it and go on about your days.just take care of your daughter and if he is home for dinner feed him also if he is not home i would not go out of my way to make him something if he can;t be a man and apologize to you.then he can feel your wrath until he does.|`|4C9U3Xh6aa	leave him alone. He will eventually come around. He will want some sooner or later. He cant hold out that long. He is just a little upset give it some time.|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Well, I think there is a communication thing going on.  Sit with him and talk with him, not the type of talk where one of ya's are about to head out the door to go to work.  But a genuine talk on the couch about you both feel and talk about things openly to each other.Make a bubble bath and sit in it and when he comes home, tell him you want him to join you.  Put on some n ice underwear to perk up the mood.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Basically you told him that you have sex with him for him, not because you enjoy it yourself.    That would be the end of my marriage.
XGgPhaDbaa	If you are busy then let the phone go to voicemail. You don't have to answer like a robot every time you get a call.   I swear people act like they HAVE to answer their phone or be on it all the time.   There is voicemail for a reason. Use it.|`|W5siRdwpaa	omgg i had a friend like that... what a pain ey??? Just tell her the truth be like im a really busy person and i cant meet up all the time cus my life is busy and be like if i am free ill let you know|`|Wf7vVQGCaa	Ahhhh, Well. You could just not pick up and then she'll think that your actually busy.     Or You can just tell her that it's nothing important for her to know.

qDpFSqn4aa	That's the reason God made Buses and Taxis.  You don't have to have a car or your license to date someone.  I let my license elapse.  I'm getting too old to be driving safely.  It sucked at first but now I see I did the right thing.  I've dated a few women in this time (about 14 years) and they didn't have a problem with me not driving.  Well I have driven when it was absolutely necessary.  I've been in too many accidents (not my fault) and banged up too many times for me to start driving again.  People on the roads are crazy these days.    Girls at bars are a waste of flesh.  They go there to have fun and most of them want to get laid when they are drunk.  I hate alcohol.  the smell of it makes me sick.  I've even kicked one girlfriend out of my bed because she only came to see me drunk and horny.  she was worse than a total waste of flesh.  If you want to date someone from a bar then I hope you get what you want out of it and not something you don't want.    I say try to get back with your last girlfriend and tell her how you feel about the car thing.  I bet she'll understand.|`|JCdBSULraa	I would say there's not much point in trying, but if it happens, it happens.   If you're that self-conscious about it, just make sure they know ahead of time, so you can get the rejection out of the way.
szVvf7Nkaa	I think you really need to talk to him in person. I understand that he's hurting but he's confused because he's afraid. He's afraid if you get back together that you could break up with him again. I don't know why you broke up with him in the first place but maybe you need to work on that and talk to your ex fiance about it. And try to work things out. And for him to date this girl he is probably doing that because he knows she is not his type and he already knows that he won't have any feelings for her.And I honestly believe that hes only with this girl because he doesnt want to be alone. If you really want this guy back then fight for him. Make him understand that you made a terrible mistake. But don't rush him. He needs to be sure that he can trust you again and that might take time. If you love him then you need to be patient with him.|`|KkmEUe1qaa	my guess is that his ego took a huge blow when you broke things off. he may not feel like he can find anything better than this girl because his confidence is shot. she is the in between girl and will not last long. are you saying breaking things off is a mistake because you want to be with him now? if so, you should talk to him about your feelings and see if you can work things out.
IkWcwsj8aa	that's just stupid, what a stupid thing to say, i mean that is so stupid, stupid beyond belief...    doesn't matter if your married or not, if you are in a relationship and u sleep with someone else then it is cheating!    stupid|`|Molu004zaa	Just another idiot trying to rationalize cheating by coming up with some ridiculous excuses. Cheating is cheating, whether you're married or just 'girlfriend and boyfriend'. Plus, EVERYONE gets married still :/ She doesn't know what she's talking about!|`|BZwJeuMGaa	i disagree.  if your with someone, your with THAT person. unless you've agreed to an open relationship which i think is bullshit...     not everyone believes in marriage, and some people are just not ready for it. it doesnt mean you dont love the person your with.   theres alot more to marriage then just not cheating, its a big responsibility, and some people arent ready for that committment|`|rEafx4QTaa	thats a nice and intelligent thought but, im going to use common sense and not try and use that as an excuse on someone that im dating|`|s6e4bqahaa	I don't believe you need a piece of paper to prove you love someone!!!  But if you do love that person,then yes,I agree,it is cheating if you even kiss another guy!
cmFU81rQaa	I don't text people much.  Texting would have nothing to do with how I felt about a girl.    Maybe it's the same for him.|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	what else do you want him to do?  He said he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.  He said he can't wait to see you, and you were together just 4 days ago.  I think his message is pretty clear.  You are just needy and insecure.  just let things go naturally.  doing what you suggested will only damage your relationship.
VshMDLW3aa	Yep. He was really super sweet and always made me feel so important to him. After a few months, though, I just felt I had done nothing to deserve it and broke up with him without even saying why :/    I regret it now. He was a great guy.|`|sCr2iTczaa	I have never sabotaged a relationship, but i do believe my bf is better then me ans deserves better but i wouldn't sabotage my relationship|`|Sv62SsxXaa	i havent - but ive had it happen to me. my boyfriend of 3 yrs broke up with me & wont allow us to talk anymore - because he claims im too good for him and he wants me to go out and find better. it actually hurt me more then any other break up because its NOT something i wanted & i still havent come to terms with it.|`|5F224cRzaa	sabotage on purose?|`|AA10529674	My Ex boyfriend did. He ended up hurting me and I was angry with him for a while. He apologized profusely and I was about to just move on and forget about him but he pleaded with me to stay friends with him. A few days afterward, I was still angry and he decided that I need time to just forget about him. Less than 2 weeks after that, I apologized to him for not totally forgiving him. After apologizing I felt a lot better and we're good friends now.
1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	No, she is refusing to leave her relationship. It's a case of have her cake and eat it too and in the end I bet she's going to choose to stay with her LTR. Things that are new and exciting (you) will eventually get old when they are no longer new, then you'll be left out in the cold with nothing.     Move on and find someone who has 100% in you and you alone.|`|nr1Bt47baa	She is using you.|`|GWECmJ46aa	no you should leave.  you will just end up getting hurt.|`|AA11706291	Stop seeing her, she is getting the steady thing from her boyfriend and the things he isn't giving her she's getting from you. She will not dump her boyfriend for you while you let her have her cake and eat it too.|`|ffd55edbc3eb321363da4138a90098abaa	Even though u might like her, I think she needs some time and space to figure out what she needs to do. Just because she's unhappy right now does not give her the right to do the person she's with so wrong and it's not fair to u either the way she runs back and forth between u two. so my advice is to tell her to make one choice either you or him.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	I think you should run and never look back. You are only looking for trouble if you continue a relationship with this woman. If she has a hard time to let this other guy go then that means, she still has deep feelings for him. And if this other guy stays in the picture then she will always be confused. I don't think it's wise for you to want to be with someone who has no clue where she is going with her life. But if you really care for her that much then maybe you should take a break and let her sort out her feelings. It could do a lot of good if you didn't see her for a while. It could open her eyes about whom she wants to be with. And once she can figure that one out then she won't be confused anymore.
AA11668492	There's a couple ways to do this.  You can start a conversation by commenting on something in the vicinity (I'd call this version situational) - like, it could be a piece of clothing she's wearing, a random person, whatever.  Just comment on the environment.    The other approach, which is more ballsy, would be to go in direct with your interest.  Something like, "Hey, I saw you from over there and I had to meet you, I'm X".  Or, "Hey, you are stunning.  I'd be kicking myself if I didn't come and talk to you."  Or, "Hey, I'm X, I had you meet you."  Basic stuff, but it takes balls and if done with confidence it would immediately build attraction with the girl.    You could also just ask her opinion on something.  It could be something as simple as "Is this the Westland stop?" or some other random innocuous question.  Once the conversation has started, you can steer it where ever you want.      Good luck, and remember that the worst she can say is no, in which case you're no worse off than before you even talked to her.  Better to try and fail than not try at all.  I got a girl's phone number today, I was walking down the street, started randomly chatting about a phone conversation she was having, and she ended up driving me home and we exchanged numbers.  This stuff works!|`|fMipszPDaa	smile at them first then if they smile back then  talk to them  |`|4cbaa6dbd59f14715a698c9f441eeec6aa	Well, if it is girls you see all the time and they see you start by saying hello and after a while they'll recognize you and will be friendly with you.  If they don't like you, for whatever reason, they won't say hi back and give off that vibe that they really don't want anything to do with you.    Try to make friends first then see where it goes from there...|`|nYzrxbc0aa	do something interesting like a trick or something and wait for them to come to you ;)|`|1QUXMRgCaa	1. Ask them for the time and start from there  2. Ask them for the name of the author of the book that they're reading.   (it's even know what they're reading, you can talk about the book!)  3. Ask if they've went to a certain school that you used to attend  4. Ask for directions to a certain destination!  5. Compliment their clothing!  6. Compliment them in general!  7. If none of the above helped then just pick you're own unique approach.|`|687614c994273a56a152c96e18a81662aa	just go up and talk to them man. dont be scared|`|rXZGdQrcaa	Say hi  I wouldn't think ur weird or anything |`|4vLt3SqFaa	Smile and say hi.  If they make eye contact or smile back continue the conversation.  Use some thought.  If they are holding flowers you say, "my but those are lovely flowers."  If they are reading  a book ask about it as if you really want to know and were considering reading it.  You get the idea.  Be pleasant and sincere.  Tailor the conversation to the situation and most people will respond to you, but be prepared to back out of the conversation gracefully if she doesn't want to visit.

MGC1NKnVaa	Focus on relaxing your body.  For example, concentrate on feeling your toes relax, then the balls of your feet, your arches, heels, ankles, all the way up to the top of your head.  If you can keep your mind focused on something other than "somebody," you will eventually fall asleep.|`|yPqk8diuaa	See the answer I give to a similar question.|`|qeUND8MGaa	Get off the f**king computer you silly silly Object.

AA11309717	She thinks there's competition. Can you handle an on again off again relationship with someone who only wants to be on when the Competition comes calling? I'd say you guys are better off just being friends|`|yC4REA3waa	give her another chance|`|auwG3d2yaa	Hey bro I can try to help you.    Best advise I can give you is to just openly talk to this girl about this. Next time you talk to her, make sure to confront her about this. Ask her why she has been avoided you, and tell her how you feel. Perhaps she is talking back to you now because she felt jealous and wanted back your attention. She liked your attention, but now when someone else has your attention she decides to try to take it back    Talk to her man, that's the only way you are going to know if you should keep trying to date her.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	She is a retard. Date the other girl. She missed her chance for greatness.|`|7TW5r5ygaa	Why do people have to be so complicated!? Go find someone you can trust and where you know where you stand. She blatently just wants your attention when it suits her and she seems to be using you.|`|MNOZPQ8jaa	I would move on with my life.  She's not being a good "girlfriend" much less a friend.  Not responding to text messages or phone calls?  Nobody is that busy.  It seems like she is one of those girls who wants what she cant have and when she gets it, doesn't want it anymore.  She is playing games and she doesn't deserve you.  Find someone who will appreciate you not someone who will keep your life in a turmoil because you don't know where you stand with her.  Nobody is worth that.  Good Luck, it's her loss.|`|Fh76mMuUaa	ask her.. be open with her... if your gonna date her you need to be open with her.|`|SRGNyXMLaa	It really depends on the situation...does she know your friend that came to stay with you? would she thinks theres something going on? either way you should definatly talk to her about how you feel, and see how she feels. (Talk in person, not texts or IM. It means more.)|`|ZAH7iOTTaa	just ask her, the best way to find out is to ask|`|DJwRCAFpaa	if she doesnt have the time of day for you for almost 3 weeks its not worth it. move along|`|goe3y4FPaa	what u should do.. is stop.. acting desperate..sending text, calling,etc  talk to other girls.. date them for the fun of it.. and rub them in her face  that way she knows she aint the only one.. and u will be more ''desirable''|`|8uhJFdOMaa	i dont know, sounds like competition. but best thing to do is ASK|`|NEfezEUQaa	competition, definitely.  she's jealous.  make sure you don't ditch your best friend to make the girl happy though.
scnW0Wzeaa	Go out and find one!|`|SivOCxSAaa	then go out and mingle girl, WORK YO BODAY|`|LMfYodo6aa	Hold a pillow and invest in a vibrator. They'll never let you down.
4wOOa0JNaa	Lots of people are just looking, and don't sign up to participate. Lots of folks don't like automatic re-enlistments, either; and most sites do that, too. It's not you. It's the system.|`|fe3863fd67cf75804445448637f44f65aa	show some cleavage in your pic|`|4ab429e808eba014a3038b5d58a37e4eaa	Go on adultfriendfinder.com.  You will get lots of responses to your personal ad.|`|AA10520412	I don't think they are being rude or why would they be on there.  Each man is looking for what he likes.  Maybe the man who likes your type just hasn't come on yet.  You have to try more than one site.  I met my husband on seniorfriendfinders.com - there are tons of sites, match.com is good, Dr. Phil is helping on there.  Yahoo is great too, just give it time.

A7pIevxPaa	Coming from a guys point of view,     I'd say he's afraid of some inner conflict between the ladies involved.     Possibly one of the two females involved makes him feel intimidated when both the females are in the same presence.    Guys will hide or avoid these feelings. He probably doesn't feel good about what he's doing but he may feel like there's no other way out.      *sigh* girls.  *double sigh* guys.  *triple sigh* god.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	That person is not a friend.|`|c9232079239008fa1ff8168aef93ab0baa	If he only acts like he is not your friend when the other girl is around he is what is known as a scumbag have nothing to do with him in the long run you will be better off.|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	This is what we call a "fair weather friend".

42HA5r4xaa	If you got to ask, then he probably is. The phone number bit is highly suspect and an old school player move. I'd trust my gut and take a pass on him.|`|J6WRbjRoaa	Player... guys who are too sweet to girls are player. they tell girls that they are pretty, that they love you. dont trust guys.|`|iVuVaa7zaa	All of those are subtle signs of him being a player. Being flirtatious is def a sign, and when they sweep you off your feet, then they tend to do it to every other girl as well.

Non sapevamo ancora che potere avessero gli ormoni e quanti danni avrebbero prodotto. Per non parlare poi quando, da adolescenti si assisteva alla disfida tra Duran Duran e Spandau Ballet.

BLM6vZWYaa	Ol querido!  Minha cria??o foi conservadora. Sempre fui feliz, mas meus pais me privaram e ainda tentam me privar de muitas coisas. Admito que isso foi muito bom para mim. Sempre me diverti muito, tive tudo que preciso, mas tinha vrias limita??es. Quando crian?a, n?o ficava brincando na rua o tempo que desejava,quando adolescente voltava mais cedo das baladinhas do que todas as minhas amigas. Ent?o isso impediu de certa forma de muitos vnculos. Depois descobrimos que aquelas pessoas populares por que eram de certa forma mais livres sempre se ferravam no fim. S que o grande diferencial  que minha m?e gostava era de ver com quem andava.. com quem estava. Ent?o sempre permitia meus luais at que amanhecesse o dia em minha casa sem sua participa??o ativa. Todos adoravam.    Querido vai ter que me contar como foi a sua!

I would also suggest if you have anything else in your house that your ex can take to sell, get it out of the house. If she knows you have something good, and when you work, you are an easy target. One other thing you can do is contact the area FBI headquarters. Believe it or not, every area has an agent. You can provide them with all the information. Just be warned, Meth heads get more than a little pissed off at people who report them.
ckjZnqHRaa	...your boyfriends dad isn't passing allot of humility and embarrassing judgment on you directly here sweetie....he already knows you are highly attractive and his horny bed squeaking son really likes ya  endearingly...LOL!!!  Your boyfriends dad used to be a horny old teenager once too ya know.  Surely the noises you two kids are making disturbs his old teenage type mentality often.  Try utilizing a blanket on the floor next time I suppose...(less squeaking noises presumably) and keep it safe and keep it sensual often...what else really?  Enjoy!!!|`|yOBSrR4raa	i'm sure the dad doesn't have a problem with sex as he does with the noise. the dry part of it they have lubes and oils to help with that. sounds like the bf should oil the bed as well to cut down on the noise or secure the bed better. we all have been caught up in certain things that seem get us over concerned. don't let it get to you. if he doesn't want you there he would tell you. generally the people that complain about the sex on stuff like that are sexually frustrated. he probably isn't getting much himself so he is taking out on you two.|`|AA11591992	You don't say anything, his dad knows what is going on so the game is up.  If the guys dad had a real problem with it he would have said something more.  Just let it go and don't screw around when parents are home.|`|qHUcyrytaa	Just play it cool and pretend it didn't happen. He obviously knows what's going on and if you are both being responsible don't worry about it.|`|f46ed724435ac2ee47d248b74aef9b48aa	I wouldn't worry about it. If he cared, he would have said something other than "keep it down". Sounds like he thought it was funny.|`|RihPWIfBaa	First of all His dad is proud of his son for having a girl (it's a man thing)so don't worry about what he thinks. He was just messing with you guys. Second   Dry humping is gay and should be embarassing. Moisten things up a bit.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	dont say anything to him, you dont even need to do anything about it. just go back there and be yourself, his dad probably wasnt surprised.  theres no point you being embarrassed if his dad doesnt see that theres anything to be embarrassed about.|`|BpyZUhK6aa	Don't worry about it. His dad is probably cool with it if he hasn't talked to either of you yet about it.|`|5ZKdo0Tqaa	just leave it alone, as time goes by you wont feel so embrassed,   i wouldnt say anything to the dad if thats who you mean omg seems to me that would make it worse..ha  if the dad wasnt embrassed to say keep the noise down, then just let it be  next time get on the floor ahhha less noise|`|aiDV9FgGaa	What is dry sex? Like just humping each other? Is orgasm acheived?  This fascinates me!    To answer your ?: Just let some time pass and it will get less awkward.|`|89TgOjXpaa	Hi , i think its okay don''t worry to much about it, his dad properly won't even remember the incident that happen you worry to much plus he knows what you guys are up to well most times lol!!    just chill it will be all okay|`|FzFSzilmaa	hahah... dry sex??? how sweet, schoolchildren trying to play grown up....    perhaps you should just be children until you are 18, then you can have REAL sex...    [EDIT - foreplay??? hahaha... no, that is childs play... and you don't sound 18... maybe 14!!!]|`|SVoOAS8Yaa	you should be ashamed. you don't have sex in the parents house.you should apologize to the dad for disrespecting his home.|`|udQlrgYRaa	laugh it off|`|fiG221SEaa	haha yea there isnt anything to be embarrassed about. as long as he wasnt having like a family/ company dinner down there. im 16 and my dad walked in on a ******** and later on complemented me on getting some that night. i was super suprised cause my dad isnt like that but dont be embarrassed!
vUVxS9Xhaa	I think you are messed up.    Get a freaking grip if you keep acting like this your boyfriend will eventually dump you because you are overly jealous and obviously insecure. You need to grow up.     If you were my girlfriend and you went to question one of my female friends i would kick you to the curb in a heart beat.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	It sounds like they were just friends.. It doesn't sound like she was trying to get with him at all.  I wouldn't make a fuss about this.|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	if you dont like it just tell him, cuz they could fall in love with each other. and he not responding to her letter about the nursing too he just trying to do something other then just talk about nursing. talk about her and probably do a liitle more when the time come and he just mate fall out of love with you|`|D5v7GouCaa	To me it seems like they are flirting a little, it might be just trying to become better friends. Ive been through something very similar to this. Men seem to be more flirty when they are taken. The best advice I can give to you is to ask questions to him. Just say to him... are we okay? is there anything going on with you and your "so called lab partner"? Let me know how it goes. Hope that helped.|`|yMtDZWt8aa	doesn't seem like a big deal to me - There is no reason a guy can't have female friends or a girl to have male friends.  Would you freak out if he was having lunch with a female co-worker?  Relax or you are going to loose him.|`|AA11886887	I am pretty sure you are one of those crazy chicks that cause us guys to stray. It sounds like he is not doing anything weird or sleeping with her behind your back. But if you continue to get all over his back for saying hello to people that are trying to be nice or get information or be a friend then I would put a nice size bet that he will cheat eventually or straight up break it off because he is tired of hearing about how you think he is doing all this wrong. Relax!|`|hyxUSsRNaa	yes i think you should stay with him as he ignored her messages   proves that he isn't interested in her and wouldn't do anything to upset you.
sl0Z4lTSaa	Get her something she likes!     For me, I'd love a video game (Tales of Vesperia) for vday. I have been dropping hints about it, lol...     Yeah, just think about what her h obbies and interests are, so your gift shows that you pay attention to her.|`|hXFndli2aa	A romantic think to do would be that you and her go out on a picnic, plan a picnic, I think that that's cute and romantic, got to a hill and watch the sunset, and buy her like a cute heart necklace pendant or a ring.   Or   You can also cook dinner for both you and her at your house  with candles and stuff make it all fancy.|`|Fnsea1sMaa	buy her some really nice jewllery   like worth a lot of money  maybe a bracelet  i love it when guys buy me stuff like that    and then you could cook for her,  so its romantic and special :)  have a great day|`|m0pYcA7Jaa	Necklaces. A pretty rose boquet for her home.     There a plenty of things you can give her. A chocolate rose would be nice too. =)|`|FVkRLl10aa	Order her gifts online from Victorias Secret. I love everything at that store. You could get her a cute hoodie, or some delicates. A really cute purse. I dont think you could go wrong with anything in that store. Personally, I absolutely love the perfumes, lotions, and bodywashes they have there. I love it when my boyfriend surprises me with gifts from V.S.     Taking your girl to a nice restaurant is still a good idea. And you could take her to the movies to see a chick flick. No matter what age you are, I think its totally romantic when your boyfriend is man enough to sit through a chick flick with you.
smIFzjv7aa	Just talk with him and see what he is like personality ways! Or stare at him and see if he looks at you back smile and if he looks away or smiles that means he likes you. and go talk to him and you will get over the lust 1nce you've talkd to him.  because with me when i have so much lust over a girl when i talk to her it goes!  hope this helps!!!|`|kYbMJLqMaa	Your mom has recently made a number of people very, very angry, including me. However, as anger serves no function in a successful rebuttal, I will simply state objectively that most of what your mom says is pure gibberish. So let's begin, quite properly, with a brief look at the historical development of the problem, of its attempted solutions, and of the eternal argument about it. Your mom wants to produce an army of mindless insects who will obey its every command. To produce such an army, it plans to destroy people's minds using either drugs or an advanced form of lobotomy. Whichever approach it takes, by allowing your mom to condone universal oppression, we are allowing it to play puppet master. The basal lie that underlies all of your mom's bad-tempered intimations is that it does the things it does "for the children". Translation: Truth is merely a social construct. I doubt you need any help from me to identify the supreme idiocy of those views but you should nevertheless be aware that your mom would have us believe that coercion in the name of liberty is a valid use of state power. Not surprisingly, its evidence for that absolutely frightful claim is top-heavy with anonymous sources and, to put it mildly, it has a checkered track record for accuracy. I think it would be more accurate for your mom to say that we must restore the traditions that it has abandoned. Those who claim otherwise do so only to justify their own flippant, saturnine shenanigans.    Next time, your mom, you may want to check your facts correctly. Truth be told, I am sick of our illustrious "leaders" treading on eggshells so as not to upset your mom. Here's what I have to say to them: Your mom has been known to "prove" statistically that all any child needs is a big dose of television every day. As you might have suspected, its proof is flawed. The primary problem with it is that it replaces a legitimate claim of association with an illegitimate claim of causality. Consequently, your mom's "proof" demonstrates only that it's a social liability. So let it call me irascible. I call it obtrusive.    I must emphasize that I am more than merely surprised by your mom's willingness to replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on reckless stoicism. I'm shocked, shocked. And, as if that weren't enough, your mom is a supporter of everything that was trendy in America in the 1960sthe marvelous effects of LSD and other psychedelic drugs, pyramid power, various oriental religious cults, transcendental meditation, UFOs and extraterrestrials, CIA conspiracies, you name it. I'll go further: Your mom is the embodiment of everything petty in our lives. Every grievance, every envy, every loathsome, mindless ideology finds expression in your mom.    We all learned the Golden Rule in school. Maybe your mom was absent that day. We have a choice. Either we let ourselves be led like lambs to the slaughter by your mom and its pals or we treat the blows of circumstance. While I don't expect you to have much trouble making up your mind you should nevertheless consider that your mom says that the sky is falling. But then it turns around and says that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative. You know, you can't have it both ways, your mom.    I was, however, going to forget about the whole thing when it suddenly occurred to me that I'm not writing this letter for your entertainment. I'm not even writing it for your education. I'm writing it for our very survival. As sullen as your mom's epigrams are, your mom should work with us, not step in at the eleventh hour and hog all the glory. Okay, I've written enough for one letter, so let me just finish by saying that your mom files one grievance after another.    Did u really waste time reading this?|`|e6a23ac67889f43ee25e6ff968fea607aa	As a girl you need to make yourself comfortable and easy going in mens company dear.Dont be scare of humiliation.Humility leads to strength and not to weakness. It is the highest form of self-respect to admit mistakes and to make amends for them.Try to watch in the guys eye and talk.with confident then i am sure no one gonna humilate u dear. If u wanna make Bf then accept the guy who accepts your Simplicity. Simplicity is the seal of truth.    Just start the conversation by "Hi" "hello"...etc..be cool chill and calm... talking to guys is nt a big deal..    if you're not inclined to start a conversation if the man isn't looking at you, how about doing something that will get him to look at you? Something really simple, like maybe just saying "Hi".    "You know, I don't work here, but I'd just like you to know that I would help you with whatever it is that you could possibly want or need..."  Men love to talk about themselves, so asking him a few questions could be a great way to break the ice.     BEST OF LUCK DEAR....(/:-)|`|dE0vtX2eaa	i guess it depends whether you talk to him often or not. if not, then you should go out with him and some other friends and after a while go out with him alone. (just as friends). after the night is over, go up to him and say. you know, i had alot of fun tonight. makes you think whether we were made to be something more than friends? so, what do you think? should we go for it?      and thens when you'll find out whether he wants you or not
CpJnhy1saa	I got married at 20, between my sophomore and junior years. My grades were better after I got married. I suppose it depends on the person and who they are marrying. We decided to wait to have kids until we both completed college and had jobs, with health insurance. (4 1/2 years later) I have been married 31 years. My husband had graduated with a bachelor's degree before we got married and was a grad student the first two years of marriage. Both sets of parents were extremely supportive. My dad did ask if I was going to finish my degree.|`|CQSB4MESaa	I was in this same situation a few years ago.  I was just in a rush to start a new life with my now husband, but we decided to wait.  What is the difference between agreeing to be with each other for the rest of your lives and actually being married?  If you agree to be with each other forever you will still reap all the benefits you have listed, not distracted by other guys, going out all the time, etc.      My husband and I married about one year after my graduation, and now I am glad we waited.  I wanted a nice elegant wedding with all my family and friends, not a courthouse or quickly planned wedding where details were not planned out.  I planned every detail of my wedding and it was exactly how I envisioned.  Planning a wedding takes a lot of time, even of you hire a wedding planner, and I don't think you have that kind of spare time while going to college.    Hope what I have shared with you helps even though it is probably not what you wanted to hear.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	DO NOT DO IT! You need to enjoy your young life.

It is not going good due to classes and trying to spend time together it is really getting to them. I believe it will all workout if they put in a plan to find a way to make it work. It all depends on how much love and trust is there to make it work.|`|CU7yipOuaa	Not recommended. You need to focus on school and getting placed after you graduate. Get married after school. You'll be thankful you did for all the right reasons.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I think it depends on the person.    I personally will not get married until after college, and preferably after I've got a decent job.    I think some people grow a lot during college, and I KNOW that I still have some growing to do, and I'd like to get a job, and do some things on my own before getting married.|`|zdpp7cubaa	I think it neither helps or hinders school work. If you are someone going to college because you are trying to get your degree and better yourself you won't be distracted by other guys or worry what you look like. My fiance and I plan to marry a few months before I graduate.|`|0jyJ6Utjaa	It depends on the person.  I was married in college, it helped some but hurt a lot more.  We divorced a couple of years after school because he spent all my $$$.  Keep your options open, life is too short to tie yourself down when you are still growing as a person.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You are considering marriage for all the wrong reasons.    Marriage is not a boot camp that will keep you from doing wrong things.  If you both love each other and you really want to complete college, you will be able to do it with no problem.
wwB3csfYaa	I can see what you mean for sure. Older people are so smart and wise. Getting advice from your 60 old friend is better then what these people have to say.   My husband and I are 23, got married at 18. He's going to school full time to become a Civil engineer, and we are so happy. We have already experienced so many stages of our lives together and we hope to look back in 50 years and see all the things we have been through that no one else understands. We are lucky because we have a 24 7 best friend. We want to renew our vows on our 30th year ann.  He has been able to go through school and I am very happy with my job so we have really made it work. Granted we never got to sleep around, party, drugs drink, but we spared ourselves the drama, the hurt, the trouble we could get into, the lonliness and feeling like someone is missing in your life. instead we have been able to save $ for vacations, drink with friends while camping, and remembering the night, never lonley in bed, had a cuddle monster always, been able to come home from work/school and talk about stresses or funny things, gym workout partner and BEST FRIENDS!    I love it!!|`|vtW3qPZmaa	I met my other haf in my first year of uni.  We lived together the entire duration of our degrees and then continued to live together post graduation while we started careers, bought a house and paid off student loans.  10 years later we're finally getting married, and I'm glad we waited  this long because now we can have the sort of wedding we both want without stressing about finance.  Not being married doesn't mean not being in a committed relationship.  We certainly haven't been sleeping around just because we weren't officially married, nor were we not focused on our schoolwork.    In fact I think that getting married at the beginning of our relationship would have added an extra layer of strain and made uni much more stressful.  While we have always been committed to each other we did recognise that being together in school and being together in the real world were 2 very different things.  We're lucky in that post-school we grew together instead of apart, but we are one of the few couples in our circle of friends that has ended up marrying the person we were with throughout our degrees.    If I had the chance to go back and do our relationship differently I wouldn't want to - I have no regrets about waiting, but I think I would have had regrets if we'd rushed into a legally binding relationship early on.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well if you can't prioritize your school work over boys, you're not mature enough to be in college, which is a big investment and costs a lot.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	If both parties while in school decide to marry, yet STILL agree that a single, mutually agreed priority, that being school, finishing it toward the prospect of your careers, then what it will necessitate is that both of the parties hold this agreement as inviolately as possible.Yes, I believe marriage while in school is possible and can be greatly mutually enjoyed.Just be mature as possible when handling the u integrity of your mutual agreement! You have my vote!|`|AA11312653	If you are "distracted by other guys" then you definitely should NOT be getting married. Get married when there is someone in your life who is so much a part of your life that you are totally indifferent to making yourself attractive for other men and don't even think about spending time with other men. Do not get married first and then expect the ring on your finger to somehow make your thoughts and attitude chaste and focus you on school. If you need to do better in school, then what you need is self discipline not a husband. "I need to get married so I can stop partying and sleeping around" is a mighty poor foundation for a relationship.|`|AA12324049	I'm curious whether you are married now and in college or if you anticipating getting married while you are in college?  Anyway, in my opinion it is better to wait until you graduate for a number of reasons.    1.  My mom married my dad when she had one semester left and never finished.  College and marriage are two very important phases in life and when you mix the two it can sometimes ruin your focus on one or both.  I'm not saying it can't work but it is harder.    2. Because of my mom's example, I vowed I would not get married until I finished college.  I got married the month I graduated and I'm still happily married 24 years later.  Who knows, it might not have worked out and I wanted to make sure that I had my degree in case I had to support myself.      3.  Often those in college get financial support from their parents and/or families.  After you are married they see you as on your own so the financial support doesn't always continue.  In this economy, college students need all the help they can get.    4.  If you are in a committed relationship and plan to marry you still have all of the benefits you mentioned above without getting married.    5. Most kids grow up a lot during their college years (I know I did) and the person you meet when you are 18 or 20 may not be right for you at 22.  Luckily for me, my husband and I were best friends for the first 3 years of college so we knew we were very compatible when we decided to get involved.  I think that is why a lot of people that get married right out of high school get divorced - because they weren't mature enough or they grew apart.     These are just a few reasons I think it is better to wait but I think when it comes down to it, everyone has to decide for themselves!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	A good marriage will help you, a bad marriage will hurt you. It doesn't have to do with college per se, it probably has more to do with a general line of reasoning that the younger you are, the more likely you are to make a bad choice when it comes to finding a mate; most people who go to college are young; therefore, there's a high likelihood these young people will make a bad decision and marry someone who might not be right for them in the long run, which will in turn cause problems in their personal life which will distract them from school. I don't think there's a direct connection between being married and doing your schoolwork, but rather an indirect one. Personally, I feel that if you have a good head on your shoulders, you will do well in college whether you're single or married. There's nothing about marriage itself that makes it more difficult to go to school, it all depends on the choices you make - but then again, the same statement applies to single people as well.    P.S. In my personal experience, being married while in college helped me immensely, as it was easier to have a companion in my life and to work as a team, as opposed to struggling on my own. I wasn't lonely, our finances were better, he was a supportive presence in my life. We are not together anymore, but our break-up had nothing to do with being in college (we split up a few years after I had graduated). At the time we were married, it was good.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I guess if you're a party girl or a crowd follower then I suppose a more settled life would be good for you in college.    it really depends on your temperament, your goals, and your maturity as to whether or not marriage during college is a good thing for you or not.  I had friends who were married and attending school.  Some of them managed quite well, some dropped out when an unexpected pregnancy came up, some broke up before they graduated.  Marriage is not for everyone or for everyone at a young age.    Marriage was never one of my life goals  as a young person and it would have been a distraction for me and not right for me.  I've always been pretty focused and I went to college to get an education and prepare for my career not to party and screw anything that moved so didn't find drugs or guys to be a distraction to me.  I partied when I wanted and I dated when I wanted and knew when to draw the line so it didn't interfere with my studies.    If marriage and college works for you then good for you!    but I do have to question why you think you don't have to worry about what you look like once you're married.  You're husband is going to be very unhappy if you truly believe that.  He doesn't stop caring about you looking good and taking care of yourself just because you're married.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I'm not married (yet) and have been going to school for 3 years now and have never worried with other guys or my looks or sex to the point where it distracted me from my school career.  I can see where it could help SOME and the other's who have a stable marriage and the emotional and financial support of a spouse.  I guess it's to each their own on this one.|`|AA11138696	I don't think it helps and it really could hurt both the studies and the relationship.  You are putting two stressful periods in life together which will make it all 4 times as bad.  If you want to nto date around you do not need to be married to stay home and study.  A ring is not going to make you stay faithful that is what character and will power and self control are for and you don't need to be married to exercise those things for yourself and the sake of your studies.|`|di6p10Ifaa	A friend of mine who got married during college said it helped a ton. She no longer had to "make" time to see him, because they were always together. He was supportive and helped her study and with her homework if she needed it. So that is one point of view. Your fiance should be very supportive of your wishes and goals as well as school work.|`|xDFaFeN9aa	I think that it is a good idea-so long as it is comfortable for you and your fiance. However, if you find someone that you love, then age doesn't matter and you could probably wait until afterward and just enjoy time together dating.|`|cvU3MOqMaa	Every situation is different. It could potentially hurt you. Planning a wedding will require a lot of effort and could be distracting from your studies. What's the rush? Why not wait until graduation?|`|RaWIRGYmaa	Life changes a lot when you get out of college - and people change with it.  My personal view is that I'd recommend waiting to make sure you're still well-suited to each other once you're out of college.    I'm planning a wedding now and I can't imagine pairing that stress with the deadlines and work of college, particularly if you are in your more advanced studies right now.  I would suspect either the school work or the planning would suffer.    But that's just me.  Everyone is different!
5mXeHYYlaa	He obviously doesn't want a regular relationship. Get on with your own life and don't worry about the new girl. She will have to take her knocks like everybody else, that's life.

0dcd37f503bc48279e49a9a0ca00f9dcaa	There is nothing much you can do. They would have to be the ones to bury the hatchet.     My sister and I have never gotten along. She was the "princess" until I came along and stole her spotlight. She never got over it and treated me bad since. While we say hello to each other and can spend time in the same room without going for each other's throat, we are not close and there is not fondness for the other.     Your sons' personalities might just clash horribly and it might be hopeless that they become close. Unfortunately, that is the way things end up.|`|QV7Jz2wJaa	Find out why they don't get along.  Ussually something has happened to cause them not to get along.  Sometimes there is nothing you can do  just support both of them

Then, just be honest with her.  Tell her you think she rocks.  Plain and simple.  "Love" is such an overused word.  Don't say it unless you mean it.  Tell her you don't want to keep your options open, that in your eyes, she's the only option.  Then ask her to be your girlfriend.    It sounds like she likes you, so definitely go for it. :)|`|253221ad74b08854dfee9d2a50aaff32aa	Sit her down, talk to her and tell her you love her, and ask her for a date.

When he starts asking you to go out, tell him you already have plans. Make a story up; tell him you are seeing this hot, young, energetic guy, named Alex and that he is so sweet and this and that. Kill him with kindness and start separating yourself from someone that probably is not worth your time. Girl... You will know when you find the right one!!|`|SSYzuckyaa	He obviously likes you and feels that constant need of getting your attention.If it bothers you that much then go and tell him.If You don't have to go through that everyday especially if you already feel harassed.If you don't want to go that extreme of reporting him for harassment, then i suggest you don't mind him at all, reject his invitations to go out and go on with your work.

MlQIqyZkaa	I would say neither option. It's selfish and self-destructive to marry (when you say propose, you do mean marriage right) or get engaged to someone whom you don't love. In the short term you will hurt this girl who loves you, in the long term, you will hurt yourself as well.    To be honest, the fact that you are considering making this decision  in such an arbitrary way, says you aren't really ready for the responsibility of a committed relationship at all. My opinion is that you should break up with both girls and take some time to mature and learn about yourself and what you want out of life. Knowing those things help make decisions about things like who to get involved with very easy.|`|435390163a4e541b09d69e6930758316aa	go for the one you love|`|fqA5sybtaa	the second one the first one should of answered by now.  don,t wait around for her if she is liike that.

r4mFLQxVaa	There are many ways. Some people are direct and just blurt it out. Kinda sweet, but not overly romantic. Hehe    Show love through your actions, not just on valentines day, but on any day you get the opportunity. You don't need ot spend loads on chocolates and flowers (although that is nice from time to time). But just helping out, treating her with respect and kindness, being honest and telling her how great she looks. Maybe writing a poem or leaving a note in the house with every reason you love her (or everything you love about her).    Take her out on a date, make her feel special.     If your going to tell her you love her, it's always best with affection, like holding her hand and looking into her eyes  :)      awwwwww. hehe|`|4d8yOK3iaa	Sit down and think about everything that you feel for them, and everything that you want to do for them.

If the person is someone you've known for a while, just let it out.|`|3fa51b6b708b89ccaaf9d048c309103faa	The direct approach is always best, especially when your heart is on the line.|`|4gIuuRhcaa	Do it as romantically as possible!|`|5f21fc1e471a252e600571f6d92c1586aa	this is not a qnu must ask sme one.. say wats in ur mind....

But you and HE are the ones in the relationship and it is HE who should call an end to their constant contact for the simple reason that it makes you uncomfortable.  I would also think twice about your friend, because she doesn't sound like she is your friend.  Been there, done that and it doesn't work out.

AA10983590	Well, I would think that it is safe to say that you two are dating.  and this guy seems like a good catch.  Dont let go of him, but I would maybe encourage you to ease back on the sex so that you can get the know this guy a bit better.  talking via MSN is one thing, but talking to him face to face is another.  So, get to know the guy, that way you know the person that you're giving yourself to much better than you did a few times before....|`|YWUjeTnUaa	Well one thing you never mentioned in your whole post...

If you like him, then you should date him. However, you should really consider a few more things:    No offense! but if you feel you only like him because of your bodily hormones, not because of something like his personality/character/jokes, then you shouldn't date him, this type of guy you described can hurt you and make you feel stress.    If you date him, you should try to appeal to his nicer side, so that he gets used to acting the same good way to you all the time, even if he treats other people bad. It's possible, I've done it with friends who were jerks to everyone, but they lightened up and became nice to me when they got to know me.    Good luck! I hope he is a good boyfriend for you and that he treats you right later on!|`|uXsqZLoiaa	go for him!  you never know what can happen until you try!

115337554e500a655e4ce026b88426f3aa	Francisco,  n?o s?o os pecados dos filhos,  mas a educa??o que as m?es d?o aos filhos. Aquela coisa de total dependncia, muitas m?es criam os filhos como se fossem seus bichinhos de estima??o, moldam os filhos da forma que elas querem, e entram depois na fase da chantagem emocional. E o filho sente-se t?o culpado, por algo que nem mesmo fez, que acaba dedicando toda sua existncia  m?e. Tenho um caso assim na familia. Meu tio. Ele se anulou para cuidar da minha av, que tornou-se totalmente dependente dele. Tanto que quando ele namorava, ela literalmente enxotava qualquer mulher que se aproximasse dele, at que ele come?ou a ser isolar. Culminando em terapia. E realmente foi isso que o centrou no nosso universo. Ela era possessiva demais.   E j existem as m?es, que nem podemos chamar de m?es,  que abandonam os filhos, exploram os filhos....  A vida  assim, meio complicada mesmo. Feliz da mulher que consegue realmente entender que criamos os filhos para o mundo, ent?o devemos dar o melhor que temos para que sejam adultos seguros e dignos. A m?e que n?o consegue ensinar o mnimo disso para o filho, ter criaturas horrendas andando por a e chamando-as de m?e... alguns na cadeia, outros na poltica....|`|1WpavEBFaa	concordo plenamente, tem mt gente pagando bem caro o aluguel de 9 meses na barriga, acho q devemos cuidar das nossas vidas , fazer nossas escolhas , m?e s serviu p/ nos carregar na barriga depois de uma boa gozada, acho q ? devemos nd p/ elas.|`|43dbf766242dd22a3b7f549c9ee519abaa	Tem m?es e m?es!

Se idolatramos o Presidente da Repblica, a m?e na micro-organiza??o tem direito de ser idolatrada. E ser a nica pessoa que nos dar a m?o no dia em que todos nos virarem as costas: quando a firma falir, virarmos bbados, perdemos as pernas e formos para uma cadeira de rodas, pra pris?o.  uma amor incondicional, irracional, levado s ltimas consequncias e que deve ser respeitado.

Ela era realmente uma for?a inexplicvel para seus filhos. Sinto que meus filhos tambm sentem essa mesma atra??o por mim.   Ainda hoje, depois de 26 anos, quando tenho pesadelos, ainda grito por esse nome: M?EEEEEEEEEE!  N?o sei explicar. N?o  idolatria n?o, pois eu era mais apegada ao meu pai.

I've heard so many people go on about how much they regret losing their V at such a young age and with the wrong person, because they weren't  physically or emotional ready. I'm 18 and I haven't done it yet, im waiting for the right guy who cares and loves me for who i am, and won't pressure me into anything. I'd rather be able to look back on doing it for the first and the only time i can lose it to be a good experience, not something i wish i'd have waited. Your time will come don't worry, maybe wait till your in university or something. And i have found guys respect me more for not being a s|ut and throwing myself to fit in with the crowd, or conforming to peer pressure.  Just hang on in there and wait till your ready and you have found the right person.|`|b71fd7cb98c2cfb6fa78323a60177c1eaa	Nah don't worry about it.|`|2cb613a7ed36239e69d3ff90f5e5ac37aa	I would have LOVED to be a virgin at 18!!

I would think of the person as someone with GREAT control and that is something to be respected.|`|d1f8a11ce43d0aac286d54fa7a0b7f1baa	no i am not having s-e-x untill married|`|ad77506eaf0ec51e97da55e3fa1a0ea6aa	No that's a stupid idea|`|415d515ff59d174742c615065ec62503aa	check ur mail|`|08123dfed82837234d534d94d4332ddaaa	nop, it doesn't matter if you r gay or straight!    that means you have something some people don't have or lost it already! so, keep it until you find someone!|`|a4ec09a660949408cc3cbda20ad8f58eaa	No,that isn't dorky!

Get to 28, and people might start looking at you funny though. Anyway.    Gay or not, here's the deal: It sounds like you might want to give up your V-card. That's fine, as long as you're ready for it. Thing is, there's this place that makes it a lot easier to find someone to do this with - it's called college. I'm not gonna come down and say that you should be in a caring, committed relationship before you do that. I'm a girl, and losing my virginity meant nothing to me, and I was 18. I didn't get all dramatic and sentimental about it. It just never held that power over me, so it might not for you too. In that case, I say go to college, have fun, meet some guys, find one you're into, and just be safe. Best of luck.|`|6535022884a5c954487e46e019261209aa	No I would not think you were a nerd.Sex isnt everything. Just because people are doing it doesnt mean you have to. Who cares what people think about you.as long as your satisfied. Being gay does make it harder because there are no other gay guys your age in your home town.And that I cant really help you with. Keep Looking though.   Good Luck!!!! You wont b needing it !!!!!|`|dcd4580c340924d33610b253c08d6704aa	why would that make you a dork.   it shows that you have enough pride in yourself to not go and **** around with anyone who winks in your general direction.    and kudos to you for realizing who you are at a young age. life is too short to pretend to be anything other than who you are and who you were meant to be. one day you will find a guy who will knock your socks off and he will be happy that you waited til you were ready.|`|be2fa030066a145097b99561837042f0aa	first of all no you are not weird! i'm waiting till i get married and i'm not weird second i want to help you with the gay issue i am religious and being gay in the bible is bad. i want to try to help you understand that being gay is wrong with out making you mad about it . you might have feeling for a guy even though you are a guy does not mean you are gay ! some times gay people have  horomone problems whitch cause them to feal some thing twards the same sex which would make them think they are gay but they are not .you need to see a doctor to have your hormone levels checked the imbalence of a hormone can cause many things and  like i said at the top it can cause fealing twards the same sex . listen you do not have to take my advice but i hope you do i'm not trying to make you mad i just want to lead as many people twards christ as i can.God Bless, Heather

a8Zxt40gaa	Le agenzie interinali, fanno da tramite tra il lavoratore e l'azienda, il dipendente interinale  di fatto un dipendente dell'agenzia che nel momento in cui lo assumo lo dirige verso l'azienda. Solitamente quando termina il rapporto con l'azienda si esaurisce anche quello con l'agenzia che lo ha reclutato. Delle cooperative invece si  soci, il rapporto con la stessa pu non esaurirsi una volta terminato quello con l'azienda presso cui si svolge la missione. Per esperienza personale tendo a preferire un'agenzia interinale da una cooperativa. Nonostante sia di Torino non ne conosco di cooperative, posso per indirizzarti verso agenzie interinali pi serie di altre. Per per evitare pubblicit lo far in privato (mail) se ti interessa l'argomento.  Buona fortuna.|`|9b5728c105d60adb2c327ac2ff3a240baa	Se sei assunto tramite agenzia hai diritto allo stesso trattamento retributivo e contributivo dei diretti dipendenti dell'azienda in cui vai a lavorare.

In cooperativa invece diventi socio (pagando una quota), i salari sono pi bassi rispetto a quelli dei dipendenti diretti e cosa pi importante di tutte la cooperativa non ha l'obbligo di farti lavorare tutti i giorni e per tutte le ore che ci sono scritte nel tuo contratto.

If he's pressuring you to leave right now so he can have that b**** around your kids, find a relative that will take you and the kids. One day when he's at work, you pack their things and you leave. You dont have to do everything step by step. You are the Mom... They are not going to take them away. If he calls the cops, oh well, you are the mom. He's gonna lose everything because he's the one thats cheating. He knows this, thats why he's threatening you. Take back your life, and your control. Pack your things a little at a time, and one day, when you're ready, LEAVE. That'll show his a**, go down and file for divorce too... Bcuz you havent worked, he'll have to pay alimony. So him telling you to get a job is just a set up.... He's gonna have to pay alimony becuz he took care of you and the kids during the marriage.... Girl you got this!!!

You're thinking about yourself, and not what is best for your kids. Yea he may have cheated and vacated the marriage, but that doesn't make him a bad father...bad husband yes.    If you want your kids, you're going to have to have job and a way to support them, let alone the fact that you can't even afford an attorney without income.    The ONLY possible outlet would be that you were a stay at home mom, or have a low paying job, and you hire the attorney and have him file a motion for interim fees. That is the only way you're going to have a lawyer in this case, in which you will definitely need one.     Consult with an attorney and find out what your options are.

Ask anyone who's been in a relationship and done the dumping.  You miss the familiarity and security and all that yada yada.  She probably thinks she made a mistake breaking up with you.    In my opinion, it's probably just her feeling lonely.  And if you don't want to look pathetic, don't take her back.  There was a reason you two didn't work out and a reason you are NOT together.  Plus, she had her chance.  Take time to grow from this, not just fall back into the same patterns of behavior.|`|27811c525c248f48283d151f747b8de3aa	well, from a different standpoint, you never gave her time to get over her anger and kept pushing it. i did the same thing. once you give them the time to get over things, they may start to realize what they lost (hopefully), and then come around to try and work things out. its not always the case with everyone, but that's what it sounds like to me.|`|180c5fa90b14e77ab29f55708333f082aa	Either she is really horny and having fantasies about you, or she left her favorite lipstick or panties in your car and wants her Cd's back.|`|cff4904343727a438f3f93e98a78979faa	WELL SHE PROBABLY NEEDED SUM TIME 2 HERSELF 2 THINK N REALIZED THAT SHE STILL WANTS U.

So why don't you just ask her what she is thinking and why all of a sudden she is calling you, because you thought she wanted you to go away?  Good luck to you.|`|AA11692313	WOW i have this problem to. You must have been really good...... no but really I think she realized that she had a good thing and now she wants you back.|`|AA12341383	have you ever thought about the fact that she knows she blew it with you and now you did exactly as she asked now she is wanting to meet, take a fools advice run like the devil was chasing you, you are better than that,she will do it again, as soon as things don't go her way
wJ12orXKaa	I really like the long one it's really heart felt. But I think if she is still mad at you I don't think she will bother reading it all. I think you shoudl tell her the 2nd one in person if you can. And if she warms up to it you can give her the second one explaining you where scared she might not want to read such a long emotional gooey mosh (it's like REALLY emotional it's soemthing I would except from my boyfreind after a fight).     Best of luck, and i hope she has cooled down in those 10 months and is thinking about giving you another chance. But boy you better of been working on those things liek you said cause if you haven't she might not want to take you back.|`|09a6e4be19614bb4babe44f26a3cdcfeaa	If someone sent me this letter.

Then when I went to the toilet I would wipe my *** with it.|`|7ebf4f741e3312a403ba6587367dca06aa	send it to her it does not matter what one but she needs to know how you feel about her cause if you dont tell her then some one else with pick her|`|WCkT1hSIaa	Send your letter..not the one that was shortened, (I liked it better anyway).  Letters are a good thing in my female opinion.  Sometimes people (men and women) have a hard time expressing thier true feelings to each other face to face, sometimes you can say things better and more clearly by writing them down.  The most important thing is just to get your feelings out there, whether it's thru a letter or a conversation.  Go for it.

fHfVRcqbaa	If you are talking about religion, it's not a race issue.  It's a religion issue.    If religious beliefs are that important to you, then no there is nothing wrong with wanting to stay within your religion.|`|t81MEJ82aa	"Racist" only applies to race, not religion. It is not wrong to want to marry someone of the same beliefs if they mean a lot to you. It is obnly common sense to do so. Also, it's not wrong if you only want to marry someone of the same race. Racism is way overrated, as long as you do not deny other people their rights.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I see nothing wrong with this. After all. if you have strong religious views and clearly you do if you feel like you want to marry someone with the same, than thats exactly what you should do. A successful marriage, in part, is based on in sync values, morals, goals and ideas.   I feel just as strongly as whether to marry someone with a different religion, both are great choices but how this will be compromised should be agreed upon.  My dad is an agnostic, my mom a christian. It worked well for them.|`|xBd96wvRaa	No.    It is a wise choice is you are very devoted to your choice of religion.  Marriage is challenging enough without adding things from the get go to disagree about.    Religion is not the same as race in a perfect world it should represent the values you hold the core of most marital problems is differing values and standards among partners.     However I would never walk away from someone who I truly loved based on religion.   But you won't have to worry about being put in that position if you only date people of your own beliefs.   For example: I am an atheist and I have never dated anyone who is religious.     Whether people think your values are perfect or flawed - it is you who will be responsible for your own happiness. Marriage is a life promise - ask yourself can you be best friends with someone of a different religion?|`|iD4ejChZaa	if you're a born again believer you cannot marry a non saved person, the two become one, therefore each must be born again, as Jesus told Nicodemus, 'ye must be born again to enter the kingdom of heaven.'   John 3;7|`|cGGvZqJNaa	I think it is good for goodness sakes.|`|5F224cRzaa	Well its there loss... I think they are ignorant|`|yy45iAbtaa	marry whom ever you want it is your life.|`|2SEVDjpnaa	I think all religions are equal in the eyes of God|`|GzL8X6vTaa	No it's not racist but I think that you are entitled to marry whoever you want.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	No. Marriages if people have been proven to last longer if the two people are of similar socio-economic backgrounds, religions, races, political views, etc.    I am not saying 'intermarriages' cannot work, but they are more likely to fail.|`|GhetCx0iaa	No, i don't think its racist.  Some people may be okay with having different religious beliefs within their marriage, and some may not.  But maybe if you do meet a person that happens to be outside of your race, and you grow to love that person, you never know.    If you were a vegetarian you wouldn't marry a meat farmer, right?|`|AA10176176	I am baptist and my husband is catholic and we have no problems what so ever.. We have been together 7 yrs  now love sees no religion, color, age etc|`|024910ffc7104c135d901f2da8f1011daa	If you love the person it doesn't matter of what religion she or he is.|`|lzooHi0Baa	It not called racist when you believe in marrying someone with the same religion, its called being wise.  Spirituality is a very important part in a relationship, after all we are spirits living in a body.  I would like to change the word religion to believer in God.   Religion separates, being a believer unites.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	It's not exactly an open-minded preference, but I don't think it's unreasonable.    I'm an atheist, and I would certainly not marry a hardcore christian because we just wouldn't be compatible. They usually have extreme political/moral views, and it just wouldn't work out, regarless of their opinions on God.    That said, I wouldn't go out with a militant fellow atheist either. And a reasonably mellow, and liberal Christian would suit me fine. Or  whatever religion they happen to be as long as they're not crazy about it.    I don't think religion really matters, unless theres a good chance that it will interfere in the relationship.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I think it's foolish, You limit yourself to possibilities.|`|ruczpWrGaa	which are you questioning? religion or race?  either way you are closing yourself off to something that might be great.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Personally I don't think it's racist to not want to marry outside your race. And I don't think it's religiously intolerant to not want to marry outside your faith. When you are picking your mate you should pick someone that you are comfortable with their beliefs. Your marriage is not a place to prove how politically correct you are to the world. I find it utterly ridiculous that people now think that if you only want to date and be with people that are similar to you that means that you must somehow be a bigot.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Not racist but it sounds like your not willing to compromise your religion for true love.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Well, race and religion are not the same thing.  Some religions (I believe this includes the Jewish faith) demand marriage with others of the same faith.  So it wouldn't be racist or hating other religions, just being faithful to your own.    I'm not religious, but I can still see the problem inherent in marrying someone who had a fundamentally different view of the world than your own.  Even if you choose to not discuss it, you will have big problems with it comes to raising children.  Do you want their heads filled with your spouses crazy religion, or your own religion?  They will think exactly the same thing from their perspective.|`|f6VhiYJeaa	I believe both religion and marriage are a massive waste of time everyone has been brain washed into.    I believe they both ruin and tear lives apart.    So what do you think?|`|0Id85yiYaa	i don't think much of it. to each their own|`|b26NgqOFaa	Inter-faith marriage?  I can't speak for everyone obviously but it was extremely important to me that my husband have the same religious background as I do.  Why would that be considered racist?      My religion is very important to me.  And so is having a family.  Knowing that we both accept the same beliefs means that we won't be confusing our kids and allows us to continue celebrating our important days the way we were raised.  We really enjoy this. If our kids grow up and decide they want something else, or no faith at all- that is another story.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	That's not at all racist because your reasons aren't race related. I do think it's important in a relationship though.     When people decide to marry, they should marry someone who is on the same page with them in areas where it matters. Money is one. Having children is another. Religion is also on that list. If you have one person who believes in God when the other person doesn't, that is one conversation that those people will never be able to pleasantly have. There is no topic that a married couple shouldn't be able to discuss. Saying that you will only marry someone of your same religion isn't the same as saying that you will only marry someone of your same profession or someone that lives in a certain neighborhood. Most people live by their religious beliefs and use that spiritual guideline during their everyday living. To sacrifice that for love means that you're putting that person above who you pray to, therefore what's the reason for praying to a God that you don't put first? You'd be better off praying to your spouse because that's who you're holding nearest and dearest to your heart.|`|71yXXY3eaa	No.  Religion and race are two different things.  Although some religions in many instances can be associated with a race such as Judaism, because religion and race are different in fundamental meaning, it would not be racist to not want to marry someone professing a different religion but simply you would be religiously intolerant.|`|UgcPxd4maa	not at all - everyone has their own prerogative! I wouldn't date outside my race for future children's sake. And I don't care how people perceive that!|`|IKXZZDH9aa	This doesn't even make sense. Are you asking what we think of interracial marriage or marriage between two persons of different religious beliefs?    Edit:     Future children's sake? Is that the best you can do curious?

I used to do the scaring thing, too, but for some reason, they don't find me that scary...  Why don't you ask your parents if they could get some cheap incentives for your siblings? You know, like a pack of gum or matchbox cars or a new game if they behave really well for the day. I tried that and it helped a lot.   Siblings can be annoying until you sit down and actually do something with them, not just shove them in the closet. Maybe ya'll could play a board game or Wii or something together.

Sometimes you just need to be open with the "ignore-er" and tell them it hurts your feelings and sometimes its best just to let it go. Who knows, they might be having a bad week. It never feels good to be ignored but don't be too persistant, or people may become annoyed.
5IKrjCHiaa	I would say something to her mother-like when I was babysitting for your daughter she said something that really surprised me. This was what she said while I was changing my baby. Either the mother knows what her daughter is feeling or she needs to know so she can keep an eye out-either way you really need to tell her, the child may need some counseling.|`|l1XxMHLlaa	You should definitely tell someone.

I remember I used to hate babies when I was younger because I had many little cousins that I would have to take care of. They would always annoy and get me into trouble by lying to the adults. Kids sometimes say things without thinking. I think maybe she is annoyed or jealous by her little sister (maybe her little sister cries a lot or gets all the attention) and thats why she is saying things like this. But, just to be on the safe side you should say something to your friend.
4drQ38qZaa	I have a bunch of stories.     Um when I first got together with my boyfriend I wrote him notes telling him I liked him and then soon this weird game called 'oreo' went around school and a guy asked him to ask me out and I said yes and he sort of fainted. Lol. He recovered. But then we became official on my birthday. So that is good.     Um my first kiss stroy. I was at my boyfriend's birthday party and his friend were there and they kept telling me that my boyfriend wanted to kiss me and that I should kiss him and when the party was almost over I talk to him about kissing which was weird and then kissed him on the cheek. He felt very dizzy after. I felt very bad afterward because well I have no clue.    Sorry the stories start with um.    Another story was when I first held hands with my current boyfriend. We went to Twilight together with my two best friends (one was my sister and one was my bff) and during the movie I slid my hand under the arm rest. I think he wanted to hold hands too because his hand soon touched mine. But after almost holding hands he had to go to the restroom! But he returned and we did the same touching hands and soon he lifted my hand and we cupped hands.    I think those are all the stories you need today. Email me if you want more!
KX5ALUzWaa	Hmmm  I'm not sure...because some guys like having to chase girls and they find it annoying and clingy when the girl chases them instead :/  I've been in exactly the same situation though...neither of us made any effort but we both still liked each other...it was like we were testing eachother.  In the end I just gave up and called though and he was over the moon about it :)  I think you should call him :) you know thats what you secretly want to do anyway.|`|eAc67eoYaa	sounds like you want to.  maybe this is the one thats gonna work.  youve never chased a guy and never really felt the urge to.  but now you do?  maybe that should tell you something.  chase him. go for it.  but dont make him think youre clingy or crazy. lol    good luck    oh and honestly. i love it when girls chase me. jus not in the crazy way like i said. lol|`|YSoBO3tpaa	he'd love you... .|`|gYyW39wTaa	Chase him|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	yes you should|`|fR2Geezcaa	Sorry to say but sounds like you might not be the only girl in his life.     Hopefully this is not the case however I would not "chase" after him. Call him to let him know you are interested and if he doesn't respond to that then time to move on. Remember, guys like the thrill of the chase, easy prey is to them is just plain boring.|`|ks2oieV0aa	Nope, Never  xox|`|ITfBQzg6aa	IF YOU WANNA KEEP HIM THEN YES..|`|CUUjvakpaa	no just  make him chase u|`|Y2sDswLBaa	Yes, i think you should give in. because you dont wanna lose him over something stupid like that|`|39pl2Dotaa	do it|`|7sxGW40qaa	Go for it.|`|AA11309717	I think you both need to invest some time into your relationship.    Call him and talk to him. Tell him you'd like to hear from him more.     Stop playing games .|`|sCr2iTczaa	Honestly. There is nothing more that turns a guy off then not calling him. My bf got mad because i never call because i am like you i don't call them. But i had to give up and call. When you don't call the feel that you are not interested and that is one vibe or message you don't want to give off if you like the guy. so i would grow up and stop playing childish games and just call him. Nobody will die if you make a phone call to him. The only thing that could happen is you two going further with the relationship.. or just splitting up. So just put on your big girl panties and give that boy a call.|`|lBLn7E13aa	do whatever ur heart tells u to do.|`|96d31d5c643374b7ec8fa40a82fc5bceaa	do what your heart tells you, you feel is right|`|9HWVqOkIaa	if you really like him and you know he likes you go for it, but be careful cuz if he;'s not calling or anything and for him it ain't a game then he might not really mean what he says|`|wCRrDn82aa	yes call him do what you feel that is the best for your relationship|`|a5VLn2cWaa	Depends on the guy. Some will love it and some will take it as a sign of weakness and use it against you cause they know now you really are interested in them .|`|oMXlbWu9aa	Guys who play games aren't interested in you, plain and simple. Find a guy who won't play games|`|DJwRCAFpaa	do it but dont over do it. youll make him feel special if you do but if you over do it youll come across as clingy|`|ZAH7iOTTaa	i wouldnt chase him persay, but call him if you want to.  maybe the more effort you put in, the more he will put in|`|goe3y4FPaa	well.. hes letting u know.. ur not all that..i wish more guys were like this.. instead of been sissys.. and been ''desperate'' if u wana chase go ahead.. but i though guys had to do that..|`|VcIYeMcyaa	hahahaha o man i love those games.. he must a tough cookie or just simply extremly busy.. and or has another Life somewhere ;) first of all make sure that he does not have another life somewhere.. and of course if that doesnt bother you. by all means go for it. but i think you should make him sweat it out a lil more.. afterall you are the innocent prey here..    btw i'm 27 i've had more gf's than i can count.. my point is i've always been the hunter and when i found someone who actually came after me.. i stayed with her.. she is now the love of my life and my soulmate. so who knows maybe you will make the right choice by hunting him down..|`|NEfezEUQaa	no no no no no.  Chasing him will indicate that you are desperate.  You can call him, but don't chase him (like, don't bug him)|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	Yes. I have always let the girl make the first move and I like it that way. Just because he's not calling doesn't mean he's not thinking about you or that he doesn't like you.     Start chasing! But keep a safe distance or you'll be dumped!
gzhaBNu7aa	By not giving it a chance, you run the risk of ruining the friendship anyways. You've entered an area where there is no turning back. He'll always have feelings for you until you allow him to entertain them. If it doesn't work out, he wont have those feelings anymore and you two can still be friends. Its hard for us guys to let go.     A guy that likes you for that long is one that would do anything for you. You're very special to him and he genuinely cares about you. Hes not in it for how you look or getting under the covers. He wants to be yours, because of the person you are. He actually loves you in his heart. The way he feels about you is how you'd want a guy to feel about you. For a situation like this "I just want to be friends" is the most crushing thing for a guys heart.    You want the person you love to be your best friend. You two already have that. Don't deny yourself the best relationship you could ever have. I've been there twice, and both times the girl didn't want to "ruin" what she already had with me. It just never worked after that. I'm still "friends" with both, but not close friends like we once were.    Plus you have to remember, that guy will find someone else one day, and what would that do to you special friendship with him? It won't last forever, especially the day he finally gets married. Don't let this opportunity escape you!|`|dE0vtX2eaa	you gta think how much of a "guy" friend he is. do you tell him everything? if so, then u guys are basically in a relationship. i mean, think about it. you and a guy, talking about everything, sharing your feelings, without the physichal part. now that part, makes the relationship even better. but can also add more problems, but being s friend for so many years. i think you guys could work through all sorts of problems. so, go for it. i mean, its not like if you guys break up you wont be best friends. itll be fine. take a walk on the wild side. good luck!|`|X1YVUA5oaa	I don't really believe in the whole "losing him as a friend" thing, and never have. If you guys get along great and have feelings for each other why not take it to the next level and actually date. Do you wanna look back in twenty years and wonder what could of been? As a guy I reaalllly hate it when a girl gives me that "friends" line. A guy and a girl can be like best friends but still be dating/lovers too. Thats how it should be actually.|`|4yaZE0Rpaa	its better to turn friendship into love,,, than love into friendship..  GO FOR IT!!!|`|SweWC8p1aa	tell him exactly as you feel.. if you really like him, go for it but make a promise to ALWAYS be friends no matter what.. This happened to me, and we were friends affter it ended.. try it out and if it doesnt work, just go  back to being best friends |`|Y2sDswLBaa	I think you should go for it because you will regret it later if you dont. Also if you are really as good of friends as you think you should be able to forgive each other after and stay friends.|`|dvX11ttNaa	Being afraid to lose him, could actually MAKE you lose him!  Don't hold back, let him know how you feel. Don't tell him you love him, if you don't. But let him know you like him! You won't lose him if you are meant to be. Honestly, i see how this is a hard decision for you! Tell him you don't want to lose your friendship, and your afraid of what might happen if you break up. Let him talk with you. But make sure you let him know you like him too! If you dont know, you'll always wonder what could have been.    Good luck!|`|KBU2X921aa	I hear that all the time when girls are scared to ruin a friendship. If its really that strong of a friendship then even if the dating didn't work out you two would still be close. I would just go with what your heart feels and not to worry. If you are going to worry you might miss out on something amazing that you might regret. But remember, being honest with him, yourself, and the relationship is KEY!|`|VSXUa9lraa	Tell him how you feel about the situation and be careful the feelings you may have could be just this emotion you think you feel but really you just like the flattery. Ask him if he thinks he could do "everything" right so you avoid losing a friend, or stay best friends and a good couple together.    Best friends in the movies always work out, in my life, all of my friends that have dated their best friend including myself- lost a friend.|`|gZmieKzeaa	First, tell him that you two need to talk.   Have a long sit-down chat and ask him how he got these feelings for you and that you have feelings for him but they arent that strong.  Be as up front as possible.  Make sure he knows, because the last thing he is going to want is for you to lead him on.  Tell him that you two should take it slow and glide into things instead of falling right into the relationship.  You two are already so close (im assuming) that you could make something like this work.  Make sure that when you talk you tell him that if you end up dating and it doesnt feel right that your just going to forget you tried it out.  i know it doesnt sound easy but forgeting things is better than dwelling on them and thinking about them.  I wish you luck let me know how it goeess.  (:|`|T5rTxUKIaa	you two could make a great couple if you both will be together since you both are best friends and like each other too.....    dont be scared you won't lose him as a bestfriend......   he'll always remain your best friend, my dear.|`|P1LkXSBLaa	If you like him too, you guys should be together.  Because if you wait to long he will move on, and when   you see him with someone else it will hurt and make you sick.
8NgbQNSMaa	wow . maybe your too young. try having guy friends rather than boyfriends. if you are still shy and different around boys have one of your girl friends come hang with you while hanging with boys. it will ease the tension. later on you will be able to come out of your shell .|`|BpyZUhK6aa	You dont seem ready yet. Just wait for the absolute right guy to come and you will know.|`|FzFSzilmaa	you aren't ready for a mature adult relationship... perhaps you shouldn't date...|`|38OLrY0Zaa	Maybe you're shy. I know I am. You mentioned being hurt in the past. Maybe that pain still lingers within you. You need to learn how to trust a person. Put yourself out there. You maybe taking the chance of getting hurt, but if you don't, you can miss out on what could have been love. There is nothing wrong with you. You just need to find a guy that you feel comfortable around. If you feel like you can't be alone with a guy, then you shouldn't. Just find someone that you trust and can talk to and be around no matter what. It may take time, and lots of it but, in the end, it'll be worth it.
AxZLKfo8aa	i have to say that i feel exactly the same as you.  i'm 21 and have never had a serious relationship.  its getting me down because i see all these couples and think, well if they can get together then wot am i doin wrong?    i had quite a sheltered childhood so when everyone was out partying or hanging with their friends, my head was in a book.  out of ten, i'd say i'm 8 in the confidence range so i don't think that the whole solution.  the right guy has never come along and if one has, they've been right idiots who don't give a hoot about me.    i get all the cheesy one liners from my friends all the time like  'don't worry, it'll happen when you least expect it'  'its right round the corner'  'don't go looking and he'll come'  does that help? eh no.    the only thing that keeps me going is that i'm a very positive person.  i just hold me head up and keep thinking one day it'll happen for me.  i just know it, i have to have that hope.    i don't think for one second that u'll die alone. ur only 23 for heavens sake! lol.  all i'll say to you is don't lose hope because girls can pick up on the lookin for the bottom of the glass expression and that is the only turn off they will have.    you should try getting your mates to set you up with someone or chat to a girl somewhere in a quiet setting. (not that its worked for me but its worth a try)|`|m3Y3KkRmaa	I would never find it a turn off! If you think it does, then don't tell them that you've never been in a relationship. Just say that you've been in few relationships but they didn't work out!    I hope you find a great partner some day and wish you all the happiness in the world when you find her !|`|AA11169206	It is a little odd, but you shouldn't dwell on it too much. If you walk around feeling miserable and desperate all day, people will pick up on that and be put off by it. Just try to relax and not think about it too much, you will meet someone nice.   Good luck :)    edit- we all get fed up of waiting around for mr/miss right, but there's not really much else you can do about. apart from getting out a bit more, maybe join some clubs related to things you are interested in to increase your chances of meeting someone with similar interests.|`|lb6s0Yvhaa	Personally, I don't think that's a turn off at all,  and I'm a woman.  There are many people out there who have never had girlfriends or boyfriends either.  Don't worry..  The right woman will come in time.  Everyone has a soul mate!  Everyone was made to meet at least one person they love and one person who will love them back.  You just have to find that one!  Its not too hard, the time will come!|`|T5rTxUKIaa	Hey you know what??????????  There's some one very special out for you........            And she is a lucky girl.......  GOD wanted you to give her the purest love.....thats why you never had any gf till now...|`|VwEUO6reaa	confidence is the key my friend...  unfortunately the problem with that is in order to get more confidence you need more practice with the fairer sex  and so on and so on..why not go to a speed dating night,if you treat it like a laugh and not have too many preconceptions you might even enjoy it!!  you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs(not sure wot that means!)  good luck and dont worry all will be groovy sooner or later,dont let it get you down...you'll be fine  the fact is there is probably a lady out there for you who is thinking exactly what you are!!|`|pTSk4O8Aaa	this girl is single and is most probably looking for a boyfriend as she has just broken up with her boyfriend. check her out at    http://www.sexyemilie.com/?id=1278065|`|MI8WTnL4aa	you will find someone when the times right. you're unlikely to while you're looking tho. just the way things go. i'm sure when you do meet someone they won'thave a problem with it but you don't have to tell them if you don't want to. If asked, perhaps just say you've never had long term serious relationship before.    What ever you do, don't act desperate. women don't find this attractive at all. If you have told women in the past and made out that you feel lonely and down about it etc wanting a gf they will run a mile i'm afraid. Just be yourself.|`|1EC8WP8Naa	I don't think it's a turn off. I think guys who have had a lot of girlfriends are a turn off, I then think what's wrong with them that they had so many girlfriends?.   But you are still 'fresh' and i would date you, becouse you are probebly a nice but what shy guy.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	ok. being depressed isn't going to help find a girlfriend. Girls notice confidence. Pick yourself up. Grab a friend and go out. Have confidence and have fun. Try not to concentrate too much on how much you want a girlfriend.   She wont just turn up at your door. They say that as soon as you stop looking, you'll find her. Which i believe is totally true. Go and have fun with some friends. eventually you'll get more confidence and you'll meet someone lovely.  Remember, so many girls wait until marriage until they have any sex. A girl will find it refreshing that you have little experience.   You're not old yet so dont give up|`|5b3uOQc6aa	As for your age:  It's defo not a turn off if you haven't been with anyone. It's not too late!! You're only 23, dude.  If you keep worrying about it you'll get older before your days.  Many people have partners and still die alone. As long as you have loved ones, that's all that matters.    As for your lack of confidence:  Don't wait for her to turn up. Cinderella won't come knocking. You have to go look for her.   There's one thing I learnt: There's some for everyone!  And there's more than twice more women than men, you'll defo manage to get one. He he.  A Muslims scholar by the name of Abu Hanifah was asked: who would want to ever marry an old woman?  He said: Every dropped one is picked up.    Also, Social Skills doesn't get you a partner. I'm crazy bout this guy who's the most softest man. A real man.
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	OK let me get this straight, you have been seeing this boy but you havent seen him in person yet AND you have to convince him to meet you. Let me break it down for you, sweetheart. First, you have to meet this guy. You are at that age, I can tell, where physical appearance is important. You dont even know what this kid looks like, how do you know that you will be attracted to him? What if he is ugly and you have invested all this time in him? Will you still like him if he is not physically appealing? Can you just go off his personality? Second, why doesnt he have a phone? That is just strange to me. Where are his parents? You are telling me that there's no phone in his house? Something sounds really fishy that he can only call you from his cousin's house and basically you are at his beacon call. You have to wait for him to call you, so if he decides not to call you or go to his cousin's house for about 6 months, where is your relationship going to be? Now for the love thing, honey I cant tell you if he loves you or not because love knows no age. I am not that type of person to tell someone that they dont know what love is because they are young. There's 45 year old people out there that dont know what love is. I just want to offer this advise to you, you need to tell him ASAP that you want to meet him and that you HAVE to meet him. If he doesnt give you a day and time or approximately then you break it off at that moment. He is hiding something if he doesnt want to meet you, whether that is ugliness or another girl. He is hiding something. :-( sorry!
MtbaNz5Yaa	I have a rental and when the last renters moved it took me and my wife two days to wash the walls and fans of all of the smoke build up    If your father has to wash the walls and ceilings because of the smoke he may get a new attitude|`|Mf78vvLbaa	Perhaps, he needs to make sure they are smoke free renters. And second, you really need to stasy out of his business. He is upset because he counts on the money. And its very stressful as it is. i think he will get over it soon, he will cool down and just apologize okay.|`|TycEvdg0aa	Give him sometime to stabalise. I am sure once your hardwork with the ads and all gets some new people over he would love it. He may not say it to you directly to you but don't get hurt by that. Fathers are never good at showing emotions(except anger).
IkWcwsj8aa	you're both over reacting|`|BkrBNTPPaa	No u r not over reacting. He should have left you a note or something or told u that he would have to leave later. I would have reacted the same way but a little more violent. u should feel hurt by this because as a person in a relationship, it doesnt look good when ur bf or gf is not there at 3 in the morning. he could have left a note by the bed left u a text so when u looked at ur phone it would be there. How would he react?
tL2U34kraa	well, she probably knows you were interested in the army and all the things that went along with that, its not like you got married and signed up for the army one day, I have friends who's hubbies are in the service, they write letters or send a journal back and forth to there spouse send pictures, keep in touch, if you are married then she can live on base at least that's how things are where, you just need to do the paperwork.yes she may be pregnant since you had your honeymoon and al that, she will probably keep you updated don't worry.talk to her, get some ideas on things you both can to while your away things you want to do to keep in touch...|`|Zvf6ulXnaa	Well darling. If your going to fort benning for training because afterall it is a training base then you wont be able to see her until after your training is over. But once you get your first permanent station then you too will be back together and with the sounds of things with a little addition to the family. Dont stress it too much cause the army will be paying you extra money to support her as well as yourself so she will be fine until you get done at fort benning. But once you reunited again you will feel like you made the best decision ever cuz any branch of the military is super family friendly and gives your whole a fmaily an amazing life. Best of luck and good luck in training! And congrats on the new addition!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Certainly! But you need to file that you are married, seeking off base housing and higher pay.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Let her stay with her parents while you finish boot camp.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	When my husband went to Benning for basic I just stayed in our hometown until he was done. That was b/c we weren't sure where he would actually end up being stationed at. SO the way the pay worked was that he was paid BAH for the area that I lived in (NOT for Benning), BAS, family separation after the first 30 days. As far as health care goes they will have you enroll her in DEERS and she will be taken care of through Tricare. There are several types of insurance programs to choose from...basically depends on what type of copay you want. Most people start out with prime b/c there is no copay. Once she's enrolled through DEERS and set up with Tricare she'll be assigned a PCM (primary care dr) She can have one in the area she is currently at and then have it switched once she joins you at your duty station. She also MUST have her ID card to access her health care (oh and dental is a separate thing and you must fill out other forms for that and you must pay for it separately...comes out of your check) After you've been gone about a month she'll get the paperwork in the mail that she needs to take to the nearest military facility to get her ID card. She needs to go to the ID office. Make sure that she has a Power of Attorney (this is a MUST!!!) , marriage certificate, social security card and that she knows your social security number (in fact she better memorize it now b/c soon she'll use it all the time...way more than her own!)   As far as when you get to your duty station you can either be put on a waiting list for on post housing or live off base. We've always lived off base. You get paid BAH and if you do it right you can make money off of it...plus you don't have people up in your business all the time. But other people really like living on base...that's just a personal preference really.  Anyway hope that helped somewhat. Good luck!|`|zGVVxuFLaa	Welcome to the Army!    You need to make sure that your recruiter has your wife's information in DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.)  This is the first step to getting her enrolled in the Tricare medical and you receiving BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing.)    In theory, she could come to Georgia and live out in town, but there really isn't much sense in that.  You will not be able to see her and she would be moving somewhere where she didn't know anyone.    The military will move her when you get to a permanent duty station, or to a school that is long enough to authorize a PCS (permanent change of station.)    Good luck to you!|`|wpyoYVaIaa	talk to your superior and ask him what happens|`|6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	As a Military Wife I can tell you first hand that there are many resources available to you and your wife.  Speak with your recruiter about points of contact.  Ask as many questions as needed until you find the answers that are suitable for you both.  Chances are good that if it is boot camp that you are off to that she will need to remain behind.  I wish you both the best of luck.
mvKDbb2uaa	It's possible.  In a lot of European countries, they actually wear their bands on the right hand.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well if your dad is italian I imagine he'd wear his ring on his left hand like the rest of the western world.  I didn't know muslims wore rings on their right hand.  why won't he come clean about being married or engaged?  sounds shady.  if he's not totally proud and happy to be married to his gf if I were her I'd be pissed.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I would think that they are married.|`|mxrlZEweaa	Apparently during the engagement they wear the rings on their right hand, then after the ceremony it gets changed to their left. Also their rings are silver, gold is not permitted.   http://www.qatarliving.com/node/282326|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Cant believe he would keep anything like this a secret from you.
dDSuBQURaa	Tie a big red bow around you and present yourself to him as the best present ever.|`|ioLun57Caa	Here goes...  A dinner that you cook yourself soft music a sexy nightie and if possible make arrangements for no interruptions.  That's pretty much what I'd like form my wife God only knows what I'll get. 20 years OMG.|`|TebPFTrJaa	Hey  I think he already told you what he wants YOU. If you really want to do something for him go out with him to have a meal at a restaurant or just spend the night with him.  Hope I helped
JOtnpGaQaa	I know what you're going through. I think that if you like her still, and can't stop thinking about her you should try contacting her. Talk to her, see if you still feel anything when you're with her. Then, you should ask, if you want to, if she's willing to try it again. I mean, are you sure she's moved on? Has she told you? If you just THINK she's moved on, you  might be wrong. MIGHT. Life works in mysterious ways, maybe it was meant to be. Maybe you were suppose to break up to realize your true feelings for one another. Or maybe you were suppose to break up cause she wasn't the one for you but you felt like she was because she made you happy or something. Its all okay. If things really don't work out for you guys ((if you don't get a second chance with her)) then you'll eventually get over her. It will just take some time. Things aren't always that easy. She just might be that person that got away or something, or just that one that was a possibility. For all you know you'll meet someone better. Just try it again, but it it don't work out, or she's taken, then just go on with life and you'll find someone better eventually. ^_^
8YZoW8K7aa	She thinks you're thinking that you aint sure of where to go from there, therefore she wont say or do much unless you make another move ;)

3720fdbc94b97994aad7fd110a20091caa	i dont think women decide in advance whether they will date middle aged men or not. attraction happens more in the spur of the moment.   but i hope not every 40 year old has a slight pudge and a balding head!|`|2d1f05b2c3f1429b28056391e24d4823aa	For some 20 somethings,  it depends on the size of the wallet.|`|666232c363fe16e3f09f28233e4da200aa	Well, my 40ish fiance does not have a pudge, has a full head of hair, and is full of more life than the majority of men in my own age group.  So, yes I am attracted to middle aged men.|`|2ee39302451a3455e007df8f2ba9e8c3aa	Not really. Sorry, but looks are the first thing that attracts people. Maybe once they get to know you then all will be ok.|`|06aecb6f8a246492242da9cc1c4591e8aa	YES...........  AM 39 years old,  And a young woman 29 years old is already attracked to my personalty and mind.|`|AA10755166	lmmfao!  my husband was 46 when i met him i was 27...i was very interested in his body! he has no slight pudge or balding head but to me all around sexxxxy!|`|AA12224567	In my experience no....  I'm 46 balding and my chest has dropped to my stomache.  I used to be a very good looking guy.    I get no response from any age now unless they see my bank accounts.  Then they all get real interested.  Sign of the times I guess.
38bd9261f1cdf1cd17104e221d5f190eaa	Personally, when I like a guy, I always give him my full attention when he's talking and make eye contact.  And it's true, I'm a tad guilty at laughing at all his jokes, even if they weren't that hilarious.    If she is laughing at your jokes, smiles when she looks at you, and seems genuinly interested in what you have to say, I say that she is definately into you!  As for not wanting to creep her out, (and thank goodness your conscious of not wanting to do that!) I would say to make subtle, SUBTLE, ways to physical contact with her.  Be creative, but start small.  Don't over crowd her with attempts, it won't come across as good.  Girls like to be touched, in a feel-good sort of way, so keep that in mind.  I hope things work out!|`|1302dc083ff40d6b43e908c3389b6127aa	basically be a gentleman.....& gal need a space too...............try hinting.......and honesty is always the best way to go.....jus tell her honestly but at the same time explain to her u dont want to jeopardize the relationship|`|3d29b3c5add26506676d0872c7b6f4b3aa	Just be her friend first. Be confident, and flirt a lot...be a little cocky too, but make sure it's funny, you don't want to seem conceited. Charm her to death! If she responds well to this, ask her to hang out with you on the weekend.|`|dcadd4dfb28832e37e59b50e75e0905aaa	ok well how can u tell if she likes u is wen she flirts and how a girl flirts is wen she smiles a lot and is kind of jumy and if she doest like u move on and how u can tell her with out ending ur friend ship say,"hi um...can i talk to u and dont get mad i meen...i dont want our friendship to end if i tell this i like u and i wish we could go out i kno it may sound wierd but would u like to be my gf?''and if she says yes u got it good!|`|3c093f28179927df703a892909e1b5b0aa	If you've already been open with out actually saying "I like you", meaning she's aware that you like, she probably doesn't return the same feelings. If she knows you like her and she's not doing anything about it, them you're better off staying friends or moving on all together. If a girl really likes a guy back, then he'll know it. Does she talk to you a lot? Does she find ways to touch your arm? Laugh at all your jokes? If YES to question 2, she likes you.|`|AA10480018	well i like a guy and im not sure if he likes me but i try to talk to him alot,i give him hugs,and i try to just be myself and in ur case if ur really good friends u can say to her.....i need to ask u a question but i dont want it to ruin our friendship or make it weird but do u like me? and be honest.......and if she says no then just say ok and u can try to give her alot of attention and be the best guy on earth that shes ever met

72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	This guy doesn't care about your feelings at all because if he did he wouldn't be hurting you on purpose over and over again. How many times are you going to let him tell you the same old excuse over and over again??? All that he's going to do is go out do what he wants and then come home and make you have pity on him. You have to wake up sooner or later and put your foot down. Either that or you need to find yourself a better man sweetie. He should be at home with you and the baby, and he should have been there with you through your pregnancy. I know that had to hurt you very deeply inside to have gone through it alone. You have to dig deep inside your heart and ask yourself is any of this worth it??? I have the feeling that you don't think he loves you. You want to believe he does, and your hoping he does, but your heart is telling you he doesn't. A person can still love you no matter who they are and what they do.

I think that you should think of some of these questions in order to answer you question  1. has he changed, or showed an effort of changing since that labor thing happened.  2. How often do you guys get in fights.  3. How often do you think of leaving him  4. Does he say that he loves you, or shows any signs    He may have just been streesed out, having a new baby is stressing. Not saying what he did to you was right.

I guess it would depend how close I was to the guy I loved whether or not I'd tell him I loved him and how he felt about it.  If he had another girl, I'd feel like I shouldn't interfere with their relationship.  It just depends how close he was to me, that's all.

962c3305c53db9b2e694e33efc4a424caa	Just because you have known her for a long time doesn't mean she is the best friend ever. My old best friend was like that too. We had all the same friends and I really liked her, but she pushed me around a lot and I got fed up with it. I was pretty rude when I told her how I felt about it, and that led us to break apart. Now we are just aquaintances, and she took all of my friends with her. You have to be polite and reassuring, and don't just tell her your problems with her. Ask her if there is any reason that she treats you differently, and you have to tell her that you won't be upset if there is a reason. Remember, if you cherish your friendship, show it through your actions towards her, and make her remember why you two are such special friends.|`|856e979b1ca891d5ab08d4da0261106aaa	First email her and tell her that u don't like the way she treats you and if she keeps it up just dump her, there are friendlier people you could be friends with|`|84c7d7b774807b25fbc8addffabb7584aa	if she changes keep her but she might be trouble you must be brave and people change in good ways and in bad ways|`|e6c5f5c81068ce7eb0ae5e138ad4eea8aa	Just tell her you love her but your tired of her pushing you around.

If she decides not to do that, then speak with her cousin but dont call the cops it would make the situation worse, people getting arrested isnt a good approach to anything.

Also your saying she had sex with him the first night meeting him. Which means your son had sex with HER the first night meeting her. Don't just blame the girl eventhough that's your "baby" he's a grown man. She's young she's bound to make stupid decisions, she's not your responsibility and the fact that "no one" wants her may be the reason for these outbursts. So instead of pushing her away and trying to get her away from your son, try being kinder to her and place yourself in her shoes for a day, also try telling her to be safer cause asking a stranger for money and using his phone is not a really smart thing to do.  Don't call the cops, and be one of those petty mothers.|`|fc23e143b614e98a0287e4a2049acbdbaa	this is tough. 1st is if she comes to your house then yes call the police and report it as a disturbance especially if it is 230 am. do not try to stop your son you will make her more appealing and push him away-let her own behavior do that and stand by him and support him no matter what|`|AA12272806	theres something called sentences. try to figure it out sometime. it would help other people figure out wat your saying.    just tell him to break up with her or something|`|64c102fea1425a354dc0402533898d7faa	truthfull he's 19, u cant controll him unless he lives in ur house, and if he does, tell him to act responsible or ur kicking him out, as for the girl tell him to take that shyt somewhere else or get out.....dont involve the police this is a family thing|`|36dea8cf6f99b545caf9cd8e90dc7db5aa	ME PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY UP TONITE AND HER HAVE IT.

Marriage is between husband and wife, not between husband, wife and whomever else they can convince to join them in the sheets.

Come out and face him with it. If he's for it, well and good, you've set a precedent, and can have an honest open relationship. If he's against it, he probably isn't the one for you, because you'll want to do it anyway later, and that will cause problems.

I would suggest just being yourself and not trying to hard to do or say the right thing.  Then you will attract the right guy/s to you who will like you for who you really are.    Don't worry, it's all about taking risks and being prepared to make a bit of a fool of yourself but it's worth it if you like a guy.  There are many other people who feel the same as you so don't feel alone.    There is a whole website devoted to having fun dating and looking for Mr Right.  Check out Will He Call...?  http://www.willhecall.com/home.php    "With the right information you will discover the freedom to relax and be yourself around guys and to enjoy finding out exactly what you want from dating, relationships and your life as a whole. So whatever youre looking for youve come to the right place; whether its love, laughs, lust or simply a life that doesnt revolve around the same questions:    Why hasnt he called?   What do I do when he doesnt call?   What will I say when he does?   Should I wait or should I call him?     And the most important question of all:  Will He Call?     Good luck and just be yourself! x

I tried it and have good result as I only recieved responses from vendors     according to my request.    One problem I had with my wedding is that it is hard to locate vendors in most website as most likely they     group by states and there are too many of them that's too far from me and I have to look at each site to     figure out.    The sites I provide above have a easy to use layout to show you pictures, pricing and location in one page     plus, you can send out your inquiry for matching vendor to contact you.

She's behind you in class, so you can always start a conversation by making a humorous comment to her under your breath when something odd or funny happens in class.  If you can't get into a full blown conversation in this situation, you can still make her laugh.  Humor is the fastest way to get a girl's attention (just not at someone else's expense--it'll make you look ugly-natured).  If you want to keep it, be yourself, and pay attention when she speaks--really listen, and remember no matter how cute or smart she is, she's just a person.  Don't put her on a pedestal, or you'll never be able to relax around her enough to have a decent shot.    Good luck.
dbvxApQWaa	Zuerst msst Ihr bei einem ruhigen Gespr?ch ohne die Kinder (z.B. wenn sie im Bett sind) kl?ren, was Ihr beide Euch von der Beziehung erhofft und wnscht. Dann k?nnt Ihr entsprechende Kompromisse finden, oder aber die Gemeinsamkeit wieder aufl?sen. Es ist sch?n, dass die Kinder ihn akzeptieren und m?gen, wenn ihm die ganze Familie aber zuviel ist, nutzt das leider nichts.   Vielleicht braucht er aber einfach nur Zeit, Ruhe und den ein oder anderen Abend/Tag mit seinen Kumpels. Da hilft nur drber reden und sich mitteilen.|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Lass ihm ein paar Tage fr sich, dann, soweit die Kinder schon alt genug sind und du jemanden hast, gib sie fr ein Wochenende ab und verbringe irgendwo ein romantisches Wochenende mit ihm.  Ich nehme an, dass du schon versucht hast mit ihm darber zu sprechen und er nicht wollte. Gib ihm das Gefhl damit jederzeit zu dir kommen zu k?nnen.  Viel Glck euch!    Schon mal berlegt woran es liegt? Vielleicht muss er einfach zu viel Vater sein und ist zu wenig deine hei?e Liebe. Bei einer Wochenendbeziehung hat man meist die komplette Aufmerksamkeit und Bewunderung, wenn man sich mal sieht. Im Alltag, besonders, wenn noch Kinder im Haus sind zeigt man seinem Partner oft zu wenig dass man ihn liebt. Ihn als Mann und nicht als Vater oder Familienmitglied oder Mitbewohner. Du hast deine Kinder gefragt ob sie wollen, dass er bleibt. Wie sieht denn deine Antwort aus?    Ansonsten sprich einfach mit ihm. Frag ihn was er will. Er wird wissen was er jetzt braucht. Sag ihm dass er seine Auszeit von den Kindern bekommt, wenn er sie braucht. Dass du mit den Kindern auch alleine zurecht kommst. Dass du ihn nicht als Babysitter brauchst. Dass du es zwar sch?n f?ndest, wenn er den Papa spielt, aber dass du ihn brauchst, weil er dir wichtig ist, weil du ihn liebst. Wenn dies denn so ist.    Ich habe sehr viel gemutma?t. Tut mir leid, wenn ich irgendwie falsch liege und dich damit angegriffen habe, dass ist nicht meine Absicht. Ich m?chte dir lediglich ein paar Gedanken mitgeben, die dir vielleicht weiterhelfen.    Also noch mal:    Alles gute euch!|`|lwKBXV6Laa	Lass ihm ein paar Tage Zeit. Fr ihn ist die neue Situation bestimmt ziemlich heftig.

Trust me, or you will lose her.  Be more of a role model for her, someone she can trust or she will never confide in you about anything.  Let her make mistakes and just give her advise in moderation.  If it turns out you are right about some things, she will most likely seek your advice more often.
Mwo1CNGRaa	As long as he is still married and seeing you, that is adultery.|`|RBtAn3b7aa	Well first of all he's legally married and to boot has two childern.. if your waiting until september for him to make his move, you shouldn't of ever moved in with him to start with! You need to get some self esteem and move on.. Hate to put it boldly to you.. But he's more than likely not going to divorse not when he can have the cake and eat it too!!!!  IF you stay then thats your problem for real! GOOD LUCk|`|yPqk8diuaa	To be honest, I don't know.  But if the laws require them to be legally married for a certain amount of time then they are probably playing it safe by allowing the marriage to continue at least a little longer than the required time just to make sure they don't become suspicious and charged with some kind of marriage, immigration or other fraud crime.  It sounds like they actually wanted to be together at first so I don't really see any fraud in that.  I wouldn't rush it until you know for certain what you're dealing with.  Besides, some people think getting to know each other first, for at least a few years, is a good idea before considering marriage.   Living together for a year isn't as long as you might think when it comes to hidden secrets or a deeper understanding of each other.  Usually by the second or third year you will know if someone is worth spending the rest of your life with.  I wouldn't rush it if you really care about him and he has been honest with you.|`|oQxh8bImaa	Sounds like you need to just straight up say it like that.     The marriage is no longer necessary.     Tell him you can't have a loose end like that if you are to continue with him....you just can't deal with it.    Honesty and communication are always the better way.     Good luck.|`|zIhxDshKaa	I think you should def talk to him about what is happening. Although he's bringing u around family and his kids so that shows something, and if the ex doesn't have a problem with you thats good too, cuz believe it sucks when they are insecure and can't handle your relationship. But I would tell him how much this is tearing you up and that you don't understand what the hold up is. Divorce is a pain in the ***, going to court and paperwork and deciding who has the kids and when the other parent gets them and then you have child support to consider, its a huge pain, but if he really loves you he should be willing to at least get the process started. If they (ur man & his x) are on good terms, it could be easy (as easy as court sh*t can be) because they can agree on everything thru mediation (out of court) but its still a process...But thats when u have to ask yourself if you are ready to have mom in the picture and a part of your life and relationship because she is ALWAYS going to be a part of his life because of the kids...its hard, i got with a guy who had a kid, then we had some kids and they had another kid and we are in the middle of a huge court battle over visits...she took them cuz we got into an argument when they were here...and we were all good friends 2 1/2 yrs ago and now we haven't seen his kids in 1 1/2 years...so theres always the possibility of serious drama and thats something you have to ask yourself if you can handle and if its worth sacrificing your sanity for. Its a tough road ahead....good luck|`|ZHWYnpthaa	He may be thinking of his children in all this ~ A divorce, no matter how amicable, is bound to have an influence on them.   Even if he does divorce, they are still his kids & you will undoubtedly have some occassioal contact with them. If this is too hard for you to deal with now, you need to think about whether you would/wouldn't cope with it in the future.|`|CkAGlkujaa	So, it wasn't a real marriage but he has kids with her??

The big reason is that if you split you will make everyone in the office, including you and her uncomfortable.  That is why in most large corporations it is prohibited.|`|IezZuF9oaa	the most important thing you have to do is not to look desperate or trying too hard.  You have to get to know her first, help her, talk to her but make sure you do it step-by-step and take the time to get to know her. Make sure she feels comfortable around you, tell her your secrets or experiences so she would open up to you also, let her feel that she could trust you. Then if you guys are like hanging out, be closer to her, get to know her more than ever, and be there for her all the time and be the first one to be beside her when it seems like she's standing on her own.   Many men struggle each day watching the love of their life flock around with other guys knowing that you are the person that really does love her. Jealousy, hatred, and a feeling of loss might all come to life during this time. But what you need to do is win that person's heart.  Courage Most girls like guys with confidence. Just walk up to her and start a simple conversation. (Example: "Hi, waiting for a friend?") If you didn't get it the first time, try and try again.   Prove that you really love her and are not simply crushing or lusting for her. Ask her about herself, talk to her, don't just move in for the kiss.   Care for Her: Ask her about her day. It's a simple way to show her that you are interested in what she does. When she starts to talk, you must give her your full attention. Look her in the eye and don't check anyone else out! And most importent of all, don't interupt!   Send mixed signals. Yeah, it's a bit childish but necessary. One day call her and compliment her, then don't call or speak to her for two days. She'll wonder why you haven't called, which means you'll be on her mind. Never go so far as to compliment her one day and make fun of her the next. Subtlety is key.   Don't tell girls - for that matter, anyone at all - they have a flaw unless you are OBVIOUSLY poking fun at them, even then only if you know they can take a joke, and know you well enough to know how to react to your teasing. Otherwise you risk putting them off.   Show respect to other girls too. When she will realize that other girls take interest in you then she will automatically get to the point where you want her to be.   Make sure to be good friends with her friends. If her friends like you, chances are she will.   Make her feel like the most beautiful thing in the world, you can actually directly say that... Girls LOVE to know they are beautiful, but don't push it, then you just feel awkward and can't hold a conversation about something else.   Be a man: walk, talk and act with confidence. Be a leader. Offer her the security you can provide.   Don't be petty: Don't complain about trivial things.   Be exciting: always talk with vigor and energy, no matter what it is.   Be playful: tease her a little, and when she teases you come right back at her with something funny. It's like two puppies wrestling. Very fun.   Take pride: Dress well and be clean. Don't litter.   Don't interrupt. Show a respect for everything and everyone. Be a good guy, understanding.   Lastly and most importantly: Respect her above all else. She is special and unique. Don't stand for even your closest friend insulting her whether right or wrong. After all, you love her, don't you? Good luck.   Also, her left side is more emotional than her right, so flirt with her while standing on her left side.   You should try to make her laugh... girls love a funny guy!!   Don't push it. No means no.   Do not cheat on her. You may never win her heart back and you could emotionally scar her and prevent her from wanting to be in a relationship again.   Understand that people change. She might be all that now, but later you may not be interested.   DO NOT try and share the same interests as the girl all the time. Sometimes girls like men who are different to them. This is why it is ALWAYS important to be yourself!   Never put all your eggs in one basket, unless ready for a devoted marriage or prolonged relationship. Understand you may get burned.   Don't worry if you don't match up with all of these suggestions. If you feel similar feelings and you love her you will be ok.                   |`|znG94ACLaa	WITH YOUR EXELEANT BEHEAVIOR.....YOU CAN DO THIS....|`|6fwEF5ATaa	O wow, thanks for all the info.

Lessen the chances of the kids getting hurt over and over again. You know? The old revolving door that dating can be!!!|`|wtGP1VUTaa	(When I was 17 my girlfriend at the time was finally ready to have sex. I, as one might expect of a 17 year old, was excited. Neither hell nor high water was going to stand between me and my final destination.  I get ready for the night, trim everything up, shower extra well. Unfortunately there was also an issue. I have a digestional disorder that sometimes cause my **** to become large and quite solid while still inside me. I wasn't aware it was a treatable problem and, in fact, just thought everyone had to deal with the equivalent of anal kidney stones. I bring this up because I had a mighty one which had been loaded into the gun for several days.  Let me set the scene. Her parents are away. We have her house to ourselves. She was always a little kinky so she demands we do it in her parents bed.  I walk in to a candle holocaust. She's been working on this all day apparently, and its as bright as high noon in there with the lights off. Which is good, because she proceeds to do a sweet, sexy little dance for me. At 16, she was AMAZING. For those of you who never experienced a female at that age, I pity the fool.  Now I'm sitting on the bed, watching this dance. I smile and tell her how good she looks. Unfortunately, most of my attention is focused on the dull throbbing from my sphincter and the large amount of intestinal discomfort associated with not dropping duce in days. But somehow I still get hard and we go to town.  She starts out on top, then we switch. I bend her over the bed, and I even smack her *** (a ballsy move at the time, but she loved it). Due to my built up distraction, I last for what seems like FOREVER. She can't stop moaning and telling me how good it feels, and then she says what every man wants to hear "I want to make you go in my mouth." I **** love women.  So she goes down on me. She was always average at best in the head department but at least she tried. She pops my **** out of her mouth long enough to look up at me and say "tell me if you like this". Then I feel it.  She stuck her finger up my ***.  My brain hits the panic switch and every muscle in my entire body locks up tighter than a three year old virgin. But its too late.  I take a massive, PAINFUL, PAINFUL ****, all over her parents comforter.  No, you aren't understanding. I mean large. Huge. IMMENSE. Take your largest **** and multiple it by forty-two and you'll have an idea of what flew out of me.  And gents, when I say flew, I don't mean "I pooped." I mean "projectile". I mean "hurricane force winds hitting an umbrella stand". And due to my condition, it comes out as a large, dark brown, smelly harpoon.  I know it hit her. I didn't see it. She ran screaming "OH MY GOD OHMYGODOHMYGODEEEEEWWWWWWWW" but I always imagined that, due to her position, it hit her right in the chin. Or at least the ****.  I would like to say I got up to go after her. But I heard the bathroom door shut and I just lied there. The smell hit me after a few seconds. It smelled like someone rolled a cat in **** and threw it into a tire fire. I looked down and saw, to date, the largest bowel movement I've ever heard of laying on the bed. Then I noticed the blood, and when I did, I noticed the pain.  Apparently the fact that it was so large caused it to rip my *** a little bit (thought I was bleeding from the inside. This little doctors trip the next day is what taught me of my condition). There was a small pool of blood where my *** had been. A final reminder of the exact place and moment I lost my virginity. I will treasure this memory for all my days.  I grab my **** with my hands and go to the downstairs bathroom. I throw around 1/3 into the toilet and flush, fearing any more will clog it and only add to my already significant woes.  I stand there, holding 2/3's of my biggest **** of all time, feeling a trickle of blood flow down my leg, trying to ignore the sharp pain stabbing my rectum. I find myself wishing I had a photo of this.  Anyway, I finish flushing my baby, clean off my hands, jam toilet paper between my cheeks (I skipped the bandaid) and went upstairs. I could hear my girlfriend sobbing from behind the bathroom door. I decided not to say anything to her and just keep moving. The smell in her parents room was abysmal. Its like when you take a **** and walk out of the bathroom you think "hey not so bad today," but then you walk back in to grab your magazine and go "HOLY ****!". It was one of those moments.  The scene is burned behind my eyelids for all time. My life. My shame. My very first time smelled like a pile of dead babies. I quickly got dressed since the heat from ten thousand candles was making the room feel more like a port-a-potty. I was aware enough to grab the comforter on my way out and drag it downstairs to their washer. Also the top and bottom sheets since the blood had leaked on through all the way to mattress. Still no sign of the GF but at this point I considered it a blessing.    I jammed in the washer with 3 loads wor|`|q2EAOoshaa	Well talk to your ex and tell him that he should start dating and then he wouldn't have a ploblem by you dating someone else|`|L6C66lAJaa	You need to just tell him that its over.

It was a big mistake of you to do something like that in her party, and she probably liked you a lot that time that it would hurt her this much and would affect her for this long. Don't you think so?  At the bar, with her smiling at you, I think that she just wants to give you an impression that she is fine and maybe she's just being nice to you. I men, with the past you two have together and  all, it is plain mean to ignore you or pretend your not alive.   With the whole internet facebook IM thing, maybe she just doesn't want to remember the bad memories you guys had? or maybe she just doesn't check in too often!    What you should've and SHOULD do if you really want to get things going and hope for answers for you numerous mind questions is just to talk to her. You should've done that at the bar because it wouldn't be such a mess. With her smiling at you and following you, she probably wanted to talk to you or you to at least acknowledge her presence.    And I don't think she is playing games, maybe she is just as confused as you! Try to clear the cloud of uncertainty and suspicions between you two! Who knows something might happen!    Hope this helps and Goodluck!
XXDnf3teaa	ahh i just want to give you lots of hugs and tell you its ok!  nothing is wrong with you, its perfectly normal to have insecurities, and stupid magazines just make us all feel worse about ourselves.   Somehow, you need to learn that we all get old, we all lose our looks, thats why its important that we have a great personality.  When you think about it.. why are you friends, with the friends you have? Not because of the way they look, but the way they make you feel. When you go out in social situations, people won't be talking/not talking to you because of the way you look, but the way you make them feel, either by making them laugh or just having a good conversation with them.  You're lucky you have a partner who wants to spend the rest of his life with YOU, knowing you will both grow old together, he loves you for YOU.   Please stop putting yourself down so much! The fact that your a mother who has brought another life into this world is such a beautiful thing, give yourself some credit!   When you wake up, try to start the day positively.   Think of all the good things in life that we maybe take for granted, you have a house, you have a family, think of developing countries.. they don't have simple things we take for granted, a lounge, a plate. etc. You have a lot to be happy for, just take a closer look ok.  I hope you get through this phase soon, and remember you are a beautiful person, even when you have your bad days, just push through, it will get better.   Do a face mask? You know what's really good for minimising pores, egg whites! Whisk some up, and let them set on your face for about 20mins. Trust me, they work!    Oh and.. you think celebrities have perfect skin?

You need to see your doctor because everything you just stated are signs of either a chemical imbalance, depression or post pardom, something very treatable. Write everything down and take it with you.  Pray for direction to go. Get up and put on makeup, even if you are not leaving the house. Sing, find something to laugh about. Watch a funny movie while doing a few situps. Everything is going to be ok because you are seeking answers. God Bless You.|`|0f20a5a6e44450923ec1dc4f592cd631aa	Get a grip of yourself.   The only reason why you are complaining about how you look is because all your other problems are resolved except for 1.     That is your lack of self confidence.  You also never really understood the situation from your husband and son eyes. One look to you as support and the other for support. You are a wonderful mum my fren.     You are already a wonderful wife and mum. A beautiful son and caring husband. Count your blessing. Unless you want to throw all this away.  The last to to do is to discount yourself from what and who you are.    You choose to live in thinking like this your whole life or choose to live and appreciate what a beautiful family and life you have. Rem that you have chosen a good husband and have born a beautiful son. |`|xRUHFv7raa	You can't really believe freckles are ugly. MANY people find them quite attractive. As for your body, start taking Pilate classes to tone those areas that make you feel inferior. It doesn't take long to start seeing a difference. Seek some counseling for why you are feeling this way. Trust me, surgery will not change your insides. Those fine lines can be minimized with a good facial routine and moisturizer with sunscreen.  I don't think your breasts are an issue or your husband would have found someone more ample before he married you. You need to get some "me" time. A day spa is a great pick me up!  You are just too preoccupied with the new child and caring for your mate that you forgot what a great person you are.  Just a little change in your routine and a professional to chat with will do wonders for your self image.|`|FeEU1IDOaa	Well for starters, you MUCH too hard on yourself. You're stuck on you not deserving him, or him deserving someone "better" than you. I have to deal with insecurities myself, and my husband is very understanding of them. I will tell you like he told me....maybe your husband could have someone that the media wants you to believe is "perfect" but guess what he picked you, and now you have to deal with it!     Don't listen to what magazines tell you! Freckles are actually adorable in my opinion. And don't worry about having small breasts, either. Obviously your husband must like them! Magazines, television ect doesn't give you realistic ideas of what women look like. Those women, models and actresses, are on super-strict diets, have all kinds of plastic surgery, and the pictures you see nine times out of ten are edited to make them look flawless. (I'm a photographer and I know how to do that. I could probably make your freckles disappear in a picture, so I would know!) And I've personally woked with models. They're not as perfect as you'd think. They are human too. They fart, they burp, they cuss, they drop their cell phones. Dont worry about that, please! It's a complete waste of your time.     Sorry that was long winded! But I would also like to add that maybe you should seek some professional help....because it sounds like you may be suffering from depression too, and there are things out there that can help you to feel better. Not just meds, either!     PS here's a top about looking revolting without makeup....same here. I just use some concealer on the worse spots, dab on a little lip gloss and light some candles instead of having all the lights on. Everyone's skin glows in candle light! Try it!|`|d08c2ff1d2c6a46f4309339f29ed68c4aa	OMG are you selfish, all i've heard is I have this, I have that, I, I, I, I,  get over your self.

A maioria aprende com seus pais, m?es, tios e avs que o corpo feminino  feio e so serve para gerar filhos.    N?o  verdade nada do que acabei de escrever.    Masturba??o n?o  somente normal para os meninos mas como tambm para as meninas.  Voc tem direito e necessidade de fazer isto, mesmo com namorado, marido ou qualquer pessoa que seja. Voc pode inclusive, alm de fazer isto sozinha, praticar com o auxlio de algem podendo ser uma irm? sua ou uma amiga.    Eu me masturbo bambm mesmo depois de casado. Esta prtica costuma tirar todo o meu stress acumulado. Quando chego ao orgasmo tenho a impress?o de que tirei um fardo enorme das minhas costas.    Eu sou pai e tenho um casal de filhos.

7YTiooX5aa	First of all every parent is like that because you are the enemy who is there and possibly the one that will take their baby girl away from them, that is something that every parent dreads. As far as your past well unfortunately it is your past and not a good one however her parents just need to see for themselves that you are no longer that person and that it was just a mistake you made and paid the price for it. I guess the only thing I could say is why not just let it alone for now give them time to see that you are a responsible guy that truly loves their daughter, If you push the issue you and her are gonna end up fighting. Give it time and maybe by the time you are done with basic training they will have softened up a little. As a mother myself I understand their out look on you but as a human being I also know that mistakes are made and people need forgiveness in order to get through their mistakes so just so you know and not that it will matter to you or fix your dilemma but I forgive you and so will they in their own time. Good luck and by the way Thanks for being one of the brave to go and protect this country from all that is out to harm us my respect and love goes out to you.|`|Ls1oc5syaa	well first does your girlfriend care if her parents hate you....but if she doesnt then dont really care about it because if you love your girlfriend then dont make anything come between you guys...|`|DtEnHza6aa	Action speaks louder than words.. you need to prove her parents that they're wrong about you..

If it's not the committed relationship and you just feel bad for sleeping with both of them, you just need to choose which one satisfies you more.

Luckily.. he was very understanding. pray before you talk to her. ask God to give you the right words. good luck!!|`|565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	Read 1 corinthians 6:9-11 and make your decision.

AA11294818	Honest opinion... it's not equal in your relationship. He can be all possessive over you and invade your personal space but you can't do the same to him? This sounds like a relationship you should do without. Make sure he stays 'boyfriend' at this point in the game, and not ending up as 'father of your child' or 'husband', because honestly if I was in your position, I'd start to have a bit of mistrust. After I had a little discussion with him about those erased text messages and the double standards he's imposing and if I wasn't satisfied with his answer, I would honestly kick the relationship to the curb... you're young and you don't need that.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Sounds like he is flirting with someone else. You need to explain how you feel to him about hiding things from you.|`|GQfQ0TsDaa	I'd confront him straight up. No questions asked.

But dont jump to conclusions, cuz it probably isnt anything serious the person mite be his friend or he jus may be trying to make u jealous. i hope things work out for u two|`|4el3goYMaa	Well, I know it's probably not what you want to hear but obviously he's  talking to other girls atleast.

But my personal thoughts are that he might be talking to another girl, but not in a romantic way. He just might be trying to avoid false accusations by you. meaning he isnt really doing anything bad he is just afraid you might think he is.|`|kh1G8Si5aa	u guys r together everyday so its unclear to see wat hes been doin... so dont give ur cell phone to him wen he wants to see who u have been txtin.. i know it sounds mean but if u want to find out wat hes been doin u have to try to get in his head|`|sr0vZPQqaa	But is he with you every night?

It was hard because we were so young and we needed to find ourselves, find who we were before actually getting too serious. I took it as it came, slowly..we have been together 9 years and have two children..we just got married the day after .|`|VuIed11caa	AKA swift! hahaha|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	it sounds like you and him both got a crush on each other but y'all want to know who likes who more but if you check out the polls the girl has a more chance of liking the boy more but hey don't listen to that cause more likely he likes you the most cause if you two was friends first then he has grow a crush on you and he is wondering if you two could be more then that but all because y'all are friends he don't want to mess that up so if you like him let him know that you two can be more then just friends.|`|7iM7heMIaa	Try to contact him again and ask him what's the situation with you or him...
c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	Observe a little bit more.  Maybe, he just want to be friends with you.

Uj5kuzoJaa	There are a lot of fun things to do! I know bowling sounds kind of lame, but it really is fun when you go with people you like. Guys like it because it gives them an opportunity to look at your butt without being called a pervert. And in most bowling alleys there's a full bar and beer! Another fun idea is go exploring together. Maybe find a mountain or beach that you've never been to and explore it together. Bring some picnic items and some wine and it can turn into a really romantic experience.  Do a search online of interesting restaurants in the are. I know where I live there are a couple places, Like theres this one where on Thursdays they have a "Build you own Bloody Mary" night with a full stock on a buffet table. It's fun and interesting. Or theres a "Cook your own steak bar" which I have found that guys love.   Look into some cool hobbies that are available where you live. Like maybe take a class together to learn how to blow glass. Or a pottery class. (Most guys like the idea of blowing glass better than pottery because it gets down to their basic level--"Me man, make fire, make pretty vase!" lol) When you sign up for a class, that guarantees at least a couple weeks where you have a set plan, takes the stress out of wondering what you're going to do tonight.   So go out there and explore the place you live, you might find some interesting things! Hope that this was helpful|`|x3LclBZ0aa	go to a nice dinner or even a casual one. go to museums, see a concert, go to the park, have a picnic, go for a drive..|`|rMeuCOtLaa	bowlin is good .  . .maybe try like sucba diving   thats if  u live some were warm xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	OK, sweetheart, ALL men, yes your man too, watches porn. It doesnt mean that you are doing something wrong or that he wants something else. That's just what they do. What you need to do is find some porn that you wouldnt mind watching, go buy it or rent it or whatever, and sit down with him and have a nice porn session. My husband and I watch born regularly. ALL THE TIME and there's nothing wrong with it. I quite enjoy it and I sometimes watch on my own so that I can learn new things. You should pay attention to the things he really gets excited about so that you can learn how to do these things. Remember, what you wont do for your man, so other woman WILL do!|`|VtTU4KcNaa	Men masturbate whether they are in a relationship or not.  Part of the reason is that our bodies are constantly producing sperm and if we don't we get blue balls.  Another reason is hormones.    As for the porn, men are visual creatures.  Our fantasies are different from women's fantasies.    You need to get over your insecurity that you are being replaced by porn stars and a box of tissues.|`|mBXu5G5saa	No you are not, I feel that when you are married, Porn should not be watched by neither the wife or the husband but for a boyfriend.... no matter what you do, he will still look at it, But Pornography is a sin and should not be watched by anyone. So yes it is wrong for him to do that.|`|m3cI54Ycaa	Who CARES!|`|clipc9yJaa	I watch it with my guy all the time and when we see something that looks fun we try it togethre. Sometimes guys jus wanna get off and not have the whole things of sex and worrying about pleasing someone else. If he is looking and using porn instead of you then that is an issue but if it is once in a while then i dont see ne thing wrong with it.    xx|`|TstiC2Ilaa	I don't really like it, but it's not cheating, so I'm okay with it. Now if he was watching a girl he knew or getting pictures from a girl he knew that would be different. But mostly likely it's just some slutty pornstar, so I can deal with it as long as he doesn't want me to watch it with him because I think it's disgusting.     EDIT:  But if you don't want him watching it, satisfy him to where he won't want to watch it ;) that's what I would do.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	porn is so NOT reality and yes its wrong especially when they have the real thing right in front of them so not good|`|NDgLcOhXaa	I dont get the big deal.  There is nothing wrong/weird/taboo about any of this.  Get over it!|`|d2c9f7f7fd791cf237b3c1d5a1ac4d5aaa	No. I do it to and I have a girl. Its not wrong.|`|SivOCxSAaa	a guy has needs and if the girl isnt putting out then thats where porn come in|`|KkjhkUbpaa	well its kinda wrong cause when a guy watches porn.. he usually jacks off. And if he jacks off over another woman.. that means he'd cheat if he had the chance..    Buts its true what they say.. a man's only as faithful as his options .
1vjFyrNJaa	It's not a big deal, but I will usually check that area out before we get down to business to try to get an idea of what he is packing.|`|C2Fh3pphaa	no just no how to work what you got   :)
XWRxRWVkaa	thats why its done in a restaurant.  if someone is going to take it hard they have no choice to keep composed as to not make a scene.    of course this can backfire if the person flys of the handle and throws a drink in your face...or worse.|`|EevMUAqJaa	That's so funny. You know, in a twisted sort of way.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	Interesting... but I wouldn't break up with someone in a restaurant. It's much better to go to the person's house.|`|7049bf1f288a6b18613b5892449d32a7aa	very wierd but i would never break up with somebody in a resturant. thats something that needs to be done in private not where everybody can see the reactions because the other person might take it alittle hard
oDGttkmLaa	*hands you a present*  You have a winning smile.|`|jBEe6Sqdaa	A present?  For what?  How am I supposed to tell you how to convince someone when you haven't convinced me?????|`|s3oOWtNnaa	Tell them...|`|ozVqauMXaa	Generally speaking, someone who thinks they "deserve" a present doesn't.  People who deserve a present are those who give...not wanting anything in return.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Why do you deserve a present?|`|lN9jcKYhaa	be like i know you want to give me a gift for my hospitality towards you, but your friendship is all i need|`|vGxipYJnaa	Talk about things you want I guess. Why do you 'deserve' a present though? is it your birthday?|`|AGbusTqGaa	A present for what?  No one deserves one, you get them bc people care about you and want to give you something to help show that.  You probably won't get one if you think you are entitled to it.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You need to be more specific. Is it your b-day? Then remind them of how old you will be. Then say I don't know what I want & name the things you like....if you just want a present say I wish so & so would buy me something for valentines day? then they will end up getting it for you.|`|6qsocyK3aa	If it's your birthday, then if they're your true friends they'll buy you something or at least acknowledge it in some way (what if they can't afford to buy you anything?).    If it's not, why do you think you deserve a present? Is it that you want them to acknowledge something you've done?|`|3bApbb2yaa	tell him|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Remind them of your past?|`|51ne4RkHaa	if they want to give you one , but if they don't well to bad|`|f4zHMZ1iaa	Throw a tantrum and then piss yourself on the floor.|`|1Nd4XrjVaa	don't say anything.. because they will think u r a freak :]|`|dVgqFDpIaa	tell them|`|mC4mnvGFaa	why do you think you 'deserve' a present?? Are you dying??
3836ce7870f6033c9a565c71eb51c35eaa	okay seriously now your married. Move on. You and your ex broke up and you guys went your seperate ways. You shouldn't even be bothered by the fact you didn't even say hi to your ex esp since you guys had a nasty break-up and the fact your still thinking about him is bad. If your ex wanted to come back into your life while your married now it sounds like you would, cause it sounds like your having 2nd thoughts about you being married. Personally I would have ignored my ex if I am married and moved on, but it all depends on the situation. At max maybe a hi and bye would have been okay and then keep it moving, but its nothing to get all mad about.|`|KkmEUe1qaa	i would have done what you did, especially since you aren't sure if it was him or not. even i you were sure, you did the righ thing.|`|qsPyi6Mhaa	you did the right thing, regardless if you lived with him or not. You respected your husband, good job girl.|`|AA10529198	WRONG.  You should have kept your head up.  Looked the person in the eye, and if it was your ex, you should have introduced them and moved on.    Your behavior was secretive, and makes it look like you have something to hide.|`|1gKbUuZVaa	wow,kinda like with me. lol i wouldnt have said hi though. i would feel bad,but he didnt say hi either so its like eh,like i never even met him.|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	But you didn't, who cares.  If it bothers you that much, it sounds like to still have mixed feeling.  Yes, you may be married, but you are putting so much thought into this.  Well, it doesn't matter if you said anything for not.  Sounds like you still feel something for this person even if it's a little bit.  Move on and just love your husband.  Just because your married doesn't mean you have to feel uncomfortable about seeing or saying anything to you ex, you both had other relationships.  I saw my ex and we had a good conversation, it sounds like he grew up.  Still he's nice looking and I even told my husband that I spoke with him.  He didn't care but I have nothing to hide.  Our kids play on the same sport team.  It's kind of hard to keep avoiding him.  I grew up!|`|k6it06fiaa	he didn't say hi so i don't think you did anything wrong.
LHzlvfRQaa	Talking about your grief, in both situations, is the best medicine, for feelings of grief.   Talk to your dad, as he will be feeling your grief as well. Also talk to a counsellor, or anyone else, you feel comfortable talking to.  Just remember the good times, and look to the future, when situations in your life can't be changed. Keep yourself busy planning your future.  Maybe buy yourself a new puppy to replace your dog. And join some new clubs/hobby groups, where you will meet new people, and make new friends.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Always remember the joy a pet brought to you and/or the family and that it lived a good life, where millions don't have that opportunity....and that is a fact. It will take time to build trust with another man, but - for what happened - it's his loss, not yours and the storm clouds will move out and bring a rainbow.|`|V1dNF1vCaa	The only advice I can give you that will truly help is to roll with the punches. I wish thier was some easier answer but there isn't. Crappy things happen for no apparent reason but it's not what happens that matters- it's how we deal with it and move on.     Start by deciding to do something new every day. Get another dog and start there from scratch. I grew up loving and losing a lot of dogs, but each one taught me something else.     Join a rambling club locally and go walking or enrol at the gym.     Don't look on the parting of you and your fiance as anything other than the thiong that set you free. You can do whatever you want now. Think about that for a while and just go with the flow.|`|XE7n66IHaa	Im so sorry for your losses. Talk to your parents im sure they will comfort you with your worries for a while and get a job( if you don`t have one)  Then try to move on gradually you will begin to feel better and happier. If it helps buy a new dog or cat to keep you company. Always remember they will always be light at the end of the tunnel somwhere!|`|bTYIIrpbaa	20? and you were about to get married?   Don't rush your life all at once you are young and should be going out with some mates to the pub. Don't worry about your dog just think of the good times and he/she was old, it is natural. There are plenty more guys out there. The person who cheated on you is a lowlife and he doesn't deserve you. If he cant keep his hands off someone else he is not worth getting upset about. Show him you don't care if you have broken up. Hold you head up high and move on from him. Once he sees that you have moved on then he will think twice about cheating on someone next time. Delete his phonenumber and email and cut him out of your life. He sounds like he is just not worth getting upset over. And it will be hard moving on from your dog but your friends are always there for you :D|`|9F76AUgfaa	Oh, Sophie, i am so sorry to read your words.  I can't even tell you that 'time heals all wounds' like some folk say,because it's not necessarily true.  All i can say is eventually you will learn to live with the pain of your loss.  Just try and take each day as it comes.  If you are in the UK go to your health shop like Holland and Barret and ask for some Rescue Remedy.You just put a few drops on your tongue.Honestly, i find it helps when someone is distressed.  You are going to come up against people that say to you 'it's only a dog'- just ignore them-they don't understand.  There will be a light at the end of the tunnel, just take your time, you'll get there eventually.  My heart goes out to you.Take it easy. With love ella x x x|`|QxWLAjcnaa	Sophie best thing to do is cherish the good moments you had with your Dog and boyfriend, use that to make you move on put the negative moments behind as you will always find the light at the end of the tunnel|`|k6it06fiaa	it will get better. You need to go out with some friends and get out of you house to take your mind off of over. I hope things will get better for you soon|`|ulIJWSeuaa	Well all i can say is to keep your head up, Don't take this as the end of the world, if you dwell on it this will kill you inside. Obviously he didnt deserve you in the first place. Get yourself out there hunny it sounds really bad but find yourself a rebound. You are hurting inside i understand but i cant stress enough about dwelling on it, try to be around people who are positive or really funny, dont listen to songs that remind you of him or wach sad movies. Listen to upbeat music. I know none of this sounds really appealing but i just when through it about 6 months ago. And honestly it onley took me about 1 month to get over him, i was with my fiance for 3 years. So i know how you feel right now and i am really sorry about your family dog.    Just remember that this is a healing process. Take care of yourself.    Good luck hunny

Then tell her that you are doing your best and if that's not good enough for her she should find another child to raise if she isn't happy with the one she gave birth to. If that doesn't work, tell her to **** off (she'll probably slap you) and proceed to fail your classes on purpose for one semester and see if her tone changes. but be prepared to suffer the consequences like grounding, no internet, and so on....

LGidAYDwaa	A lot of marriages end up with this exact problem when it comes to intimacy. One partner ends up not even trying to get any intimacy because every time they ask, the other person says no or isn't interested. So, they give up asking. Then the other person is like "why don't you ever bring up intimacy? I'm always the one who has to initiate it!" And the reason they give? "I quit trying because you always say no".  It's a horrible cycle to get into, since both are left unhappy. It's doing the same thing to your relationship when it comes to calling and messaging. Let your b/f know that you'll be more willing to call if he'll be more willing to call back. It's a first step and hopefully your b/f will realize it's actually important to you and make that a goal of his - to return your calls.  OR, you can change the purpose of your calls. Instead of making a returned call a necessity, just leave cute little messages like, "I just saw the most amazing (book/movie/tv show, etc) that made me think of you. hope you're having a good day." And leave it at that. Leave anything for which you need an answer for face-to-face or when he actually answers the phone. Above all, regardless of what you two decide to do about it, never sit waiting for him to call you back. You need to have friends and a life of your own. If he doesn't call back in time to go out and do something with you, then go out and have fun without him. He will either realize he's missing a lot of time with you and step up to the plate, or he'll just deal with it.|`|Ra24OqXXaa	My bf would tell me to call him, but when i did he wouldn't answer. I wasn't supposed to be talking to him on my home phone anyway, so i stopped calling him for two days, and he knew that he couldn't call me. After 2 days, i kept getting phone calls from my best friend, telling me that he said call. I still didn't call him, I guess it was a sort of punishment LOL!!!!|`|el8XHxBpaa	My fiance txts me ALL day. i cant txt as much because i work 5am-6pm and can only txt sometimes. she gets upset sometimes lol.  To me it seems kinda childish to not call cuz he don't.  Call or send a txt just to tell him you are thinking of him sometimes.|`|TKaM7Cvwaa	What do you mean by, "right away"? Does he wait a day? A week? It sounds a little silly to me. If he has no interest in talking to you, then you should probably reconsider your relationship with him. It really shouldn't be a game to either one of you, especially if you are in a caring relationship. It isn't productive to keep tabs on eachother either. It's all about equal reciprocation, IMO.|`|UgcPxd4maa	I don't and wouldn't do that with my bf cause everyday is different, some days he's crazy busy at work, and some days he has all day to chat, and vice versa....so no, whay would you keep a stupid "score" like that in a relationship?|`|8HDQMkSBaa	WOW....what about world hunger???|`|mJDqKejtaa	no i always text him but we never call each other|`|MsSHhX8zaa	I think it is silly. I completely understand where you're coming from though. I was in a relationship where I was the one who put the most into the relationship, i was the one who initiated the conversations, and i was the one who called but never had my calls returned. It's a horrible feeling because you start to wonder if there's a reason why you're the one that's doing everything or if you're not important enough to be called back.     But just think, because you're not willing to make that extra effort to call or text your boyfriend, you're not communicating, and you're losing all that time you could be spending talking.|`|UP33GlBwaa	Crap, no.  I call if I want and if he doesnt call, then **** him.  I dont have time to play baby games. I have bigger problems then to let a guy jerk me around or to waste my time with a jerk.
DaKOec8aaa	absolutely YES! but  if you  cant tell to your spouse "youre in the bad mood " .... spend moretime w/your spouse  ,give more attentions and try to sit at his/her back  give embrace while giving   slight massage ....let your spouse feel that you'll always  willing to listen  morethan anyone else....ask some question that you cant offfend him/her....GOOD LUCK !|`|POHWTDPRaa	God, yes.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Oh yeah. When he's in a bad mood, he gets quiet. I've never seen him in a very bad mood. Since he's been a stay at home dad, he doesn't get into bad moods much anymore. I've found that I'm the one who's quicker to get into a bad mood but because of his pleasant mood, once I walk thru the door, my bad mood is lightened.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	yes he usually gets red in the face starts yelling or totally ignores me|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Yes, absolutely, and I just steer clear so he can't take it out on everyone.  He usually rings me on his way home from work to let me know he's on his way (no, nothing controlling, just so I know I can turn dinner on), and I can tell over the phone if he's had a bad day.  I try to make sure I can give him a hug and ask about his day, instead of telling him anything about mine, so he feels I am there to listen to him and he won't take it out on me or the kids.  He eventually calms down.    If he is angry at me or the kids, I can always tell by his body language. But I never hound him about it.  If he starts picking at things because he's in a foul mood, I just pull him up on it by saying "Is there really any need for you to be like that?".  That usually stops him in his tracks.|`|AA11496842	My spouse is not a moody person. He's the most easy going and laid back person, always smiling about something.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Absolutely.  Often, I can tell she's in a bad mood before she even realizes she's in a bad mood.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	yup|`|rH33ty23aa	I know my husbands moods very well. He is in Iraq and i can even tell thru emails and txt what his mood is. Which comes in handy because they cant tell us wifes much at all.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Easy to tell with both men and women.     If a man comes home with a grumpy frown and you ask "what's wrong?" and he says "nothing", he means that nothing is wrong. He just wants to relax for a minute. He'll tell you when he is in a bad mood.    If a woman come home with a grumpy frown and you ask "what's wrong?" and she says "nothing", she means she wants you to show you care about her feelings by coaxing it out of her. She'll tell you she is in a bad mood after you show interest.|`|FHu7pHhRaa	I'm not married but I can tell if my friends are in bad moods!  x|`|JaNE0HKyaa	Yes I can it is very easy to tell.|`|207dFmdHaa	Yes, but it is rare....I am one of the lucky people in the world who married a man who wakes up in a good mood...he is always positive, for the last 33 years, I can count on 1 hand the times he has been in a bad mood.....but when he is I can tell, his usual smile is not there, his pep, his look that he can fix anything and we can get thru anything is gone.....normal little things dont put my husband in a bad mood, he doesnt sweat the small stuff....|`|U5IigAByaa	definitely. he's like a bear with a sore head!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Absolutely!  That's a no-brainer!|`|Gv71dW0oaa	Yes!|`|672Wl59Paa	Ohhh yeah, when he's in a bad mood it either puts me in a bad mood or I just stay clear away from him.  And viceversa with me.  He doesn't like it when i'm grumpy and don't want to talk to him.  OH well it happens to all of us!!|`|dnFpyyMSaa	Who cares about his mood?|`|LgvegbIVaa	Definitely. You have to watch people's body language and tone of voice. My spouse gets quiet.

Find a place to live - do not let him know where.    Contact a women's shelter (they know all about women leaving abusive men) and ask them what the safest way for you to move out is.  They will know the laws in NJ and be able to advise you as to whether you can request police protection while you move, etc.    Be careful & stay safe!|`|0Id85yiYaa	you're getting a preview of what marriage would be like, except that it will only get worse. get out now.
iVnQ4aCiaa	Hooters?  Just kidding.  Steak sounds good and guy always love it.  What about a seafood place?  Fondue?|`|PfE6bg5iaa	Congrats!    steak's good... buffalo wild wings is a favorite for my fiance, if there's a place like that by you... you know, like a sports bar?    And actually, I went to Hooters one time with two of my guy friends since it was one of their birthday. The burger I had was pretty good, and it's not like a strip club...|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	yay|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Take him to his favorite restaurant|`|AA10787865	It really depends on his taste. My husband has some criteria when it comes to restaurants he enjoying visiting:     1. They serve something you can't get anywhere else  2. They treat him like a king - 5 star service    There was another one I forgot. But check out Yelp or Chowhound for some ideas.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I know you're in the DC area, like me. If you post a little more info about roughly where you live, I can give you LOTS of suggestions, as we go out to eat a lot.     Off the top of my head, though, I'd start with Maggiano's (even though I usually hate mall chains). That place is awesome.    There's also a Ruth's Chris steakhouse on Monument Drive in Fairfax that is spectacular, but high-end. You may want to check their website for a menu and prices, as it is a bit steep (but, you know, special occasion).    If he likes middle-eastern or Mediterranean food at all, try the Lebanese Taverna (it's at one of the Tysons locations, I believe - the newer, fancier one). They serve steak with seasoning, and it's really delicious.    Congratulations!!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Yeah, steak.  The carnal relationship men have with meat is beyond me LOL.|`|0Id85yiYaa	steak is the first thing that came to my mind    congrats!|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	Im glad everything is working out for you. I dont know where you live but i live in nyc and there is a restaurant in every corner. So im going to try to suggest a restaurant that is national. What about olive garden. I love that restaurant. What about ruby tuesday or red lobster. Thats a great thing to do. Have fun. Going to a restaurant with my fiance is hell. My fiance is a chef and there is always something wrong with his food. I could count the times he haa been completely happy with dinner.
uBssj3Znaa	Tell her it is over and then stop picking up her calls ... then she will get the hint.|`|HaEsRdC0aa	Don't let her treat you like that. She's playing you. Of course, it is easier to see things looking outside the box. =) You seem like a great guy, go find a great girl!!|`|ark4Psqjaa	well it is better when you tell her face to face or by phone and don'r answer her calls after you tell her it is over|`|PROxs7qJaa	What religion is she? Maybe she's afraid you'll treat her like a toy. Not that I think you would.   Just call her and tell her "We should just stay good friends." ?  That's it.  YOU have to find courage to do it. Don't be afraid.     Good luck.|`|sY8F5cytaa	iight mayb u shood talk 2 her bout the way u feel cuz it woodnt b rite 2 leave her hangin like dat since u have fallen 4 her so much... but if u feel like dis relationship isnt goin ny where then u need 2 let her kno its all bout communication n it seems like u guys dnt have dat n u need 2 get dat n in order 2 really understand how u each r feelin!
9Q1muFGXaa	We have had a hard couple years and owe my husbands parents like 5k now. I ask my husband if he wants to talk to them about setting up a payment arrangement but he always says no. I don't think he actually has any intent on paying them back at all. So now i got to listen to his mom. i tell her she gave him the money and she needs to ask him because he says nothing about to me. We got a majority of that money almost 2 years ago. He said a few days ago that he would like to start giving them money. So i don't know if he will or not. i have borrowed money from my dad but have always paid him back. Our friends are always broke.lol. But they would get paid back b4 his parents would.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	You should pay back your parents.|`|cyht3kSvaa	yes|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Talk to your parents about it.|`|0adde2725ea90445eb116c6f500bdd2daa	oh yea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	You pay back the person who you borrowed from first.|`|VLBT0tu8aa	Yes because my parents are more understanding.|`|n6DcjcmLaa	u can sell some of ur old thing that u dont want and not tell ur parents and pay off ur frinds that way|`|0AjyzHUHaa	You should pay back whom ever your borrowed your money from first.  But make sure everyone knows where they're at (ie. I borrowed money from so and so first so I'm going to pay them back, but you're next since I borrowed money from you second, and so on).    At least that's what I would do.  Although everyone's right parents are more understanding, but then again, for whatever reason your borrowing money for just remember that if you can't afford it in the beginning, then you probably don't need it!!!!|`|tGlnumvKaa	You shouldn't be borrowing money in the first place! If you do, pay the person back you borrowed off of first.
2t62ETgEaa	First of all who will be Godparents will have to be agreed between you and your husband/the father..and tell her until then it's not even a subject to be discussed.Next time she says you're pregnant.Just say "you're doing it again" , and walk away.The more you verbally disagree the more she has to say back.or just walk away..Sounds like she may have some jealousy because you have freedom and she doesn't .Keep your chin up, and go be successful in life..good luck|`|iVq1byuwaa	My dear Priscilla  yeah, well, you sound like a very sensitive and caring person. I'm sure you'll get though this bad times. No matter what you think about the situation now, just remember, IT WILL GET BETTER!   Hope i've helped.    Love and support from Italy,  Kati Rio Degranero xx
fIWzTzfFaa	It's not the same. Physically attractive is just tolerable with no fireworks going off in your soul when you see them. Now sexually attractive is when you see somebody and you lose focus or start salivating or forgetting what you're saying to your homie or you walk into a pole because your head is turned around the other way while you're walking.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	very different things, you clearly already know this.|`|KWl605JTaa	yeah I like men who are physically attractive.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	it depends on your preferences, i personally like athletic girls better.  from my experience they will stay in shape and are better in bed.  i like girls who have a healthy life style.|`|CJ75pkgzaa	Yes I do the other day at school I saw the cutest girl and my heart litterily went soft and mellow I was stunned by her,looks make 70% of me falling inlove|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Physically fit and physically attractive are two different things/types|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	I think you are drawing a distinction when one really doesn't exist. The saying physically attractive doesn't concern physicality at all. It just means that someone, based purely on their appearance, is attractive.|`|uCD0cKttaa	i dont get it its all the same to me|`|H8P1oKT3aa	I've seen girls who are exotic looking. That make me attracted to them. But there's no telling exactly what im attracted to about them. It's a mix of alot. Some people say smell.

I have a term I use when I'm attracted to someone and that someone seems attracted to me and the word is 'clicked'.  It's like when your eyes meet in a crowded room and you 'click'.  thanks|`|gFHzuIrUaa	I think physically attractive is when that person just looks good to you, and sexually attractive is when you just wanna "do" that person. But someone who is sexually attractive to you might just be physically attractive to someone else. I think it all just depends.|`|3c0J1meGaa	I think they're both kinda the same really.  I don't think I would be attracted sexually to someone that I did not find physically attractive|`|4tDTQOgNaa	There both 2 different things. I have never been physically attracted to somebody. Now I'm in college I am attracted sexually to some men.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	there is a difference|`|1oiUVWvYaa	to me, eva mendes is physically attractive, like, i can see what the appeal is, cause she looks good, but i am not in any way sexually attracted to her. is this what you mean?|`|f11aaf0e82de675b10c7a24c978ee269aa	Yeah I like guys that are physically attractive, but I don't really think looks really matter. Unfortunately in our society it does!! I've been with the cutest and most gorgeous guy, but his bed game was HORRIBLE!!! I've talked to unattractive guys that are either way too nice because there ugly or a jerk because there use to getting picked on. I really thinks it depends on what type of person you are..|`|4GKZneneaa	i think that physically attractive is the looks of a person   i think that sexually attractive is the way somebody performs ;}  and if your not attracted to neither of those I believe there is a way to fall in love with somebodys personality and somepeople fall in love with some one else's material things but to answer the question yes I am attracted to physically attractive men.|`|xxiX1qQgaa	Yes people that are very attractive capture your attention, for me sexually attractive is like you desire the person, physically attractive is like you' re like whoa what a great body, look the eyes, things like that.|`|izbAdDUraa	physically attractive just means you are attracted to their physical appearance. that does not mean they are body builder types.  sexually attractive means you are attracted to them in only a sexual way, that does not mean their appearance is sexy necessarily.   i think you are mistaken..   but yes there is a difference between the two.  and NO body builder women are not attractive in anyway to me. gross.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Any guy who I find 'physically attractive' I would want to have sex with.

I have found over the years that if you come out tell a girl how you feel about her you can scare them off and not mean too.      Maybe someone told him something about you without you knowing and he's listening to them and not asking you if it's even true or not.      I would just act the same way and see if he comes around or if it bothers you that much then you should just walk up to him and ask him if there's something you said or did that has made him ignore you.|`|yY4MIlMOaa	maybe he really liked you and wanted you to call on a personal basis, you didt and now he has moved on.....if he has someone now he wont respond for fear of making her mad|`|48m0Ls7gaa	try to lestion to fwhat they whany|`|BkOgWbg6aa	Okay there are at least two things i can think of one you should try to talk to him if he still ignors you or wont talk to you then two he may have found somebody he likes and maybe he liked you before he started talking to this other person if thats the case then he may not be talking to you because he may be scared that if he does his feeling for you will come back and that may mess up what he has now|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	Maybe he was trying to see how far he could get with you and realized you aren't going to "give it up" so he's just ignoring you.|`|rVPrhd26aa	he sounds like a self centered snob to me.... that or perhaps he has an abusive girlfriend who will beat him up if she catches him talking to anyone female... or just a really controlling girlfriend.

Shame on you for letting it happen 3 times. That's your fault. If you don't want to whip her then call the cops on your disobedient kid. Tell her she does it again she can and will go to jail. My neighbor did that to her daughter for being unruly and she went to jdc and came back a couple weeks later i think it was that long, she came back a better kid. I remember when i was younger my parents told me not to go on the railroad tracks. Well i did and when they found out about it my mom whooped my butt and I can honestly say i never went back on the railroad tracks. Good luck. Or if you want to play nice parents then buy the kid a trampoline or something and tell her she has to stay off the roof, nothing like trying to buy your kids love and good behavior. I see to many parents do that. But whatever i hope we don't see you or your family on the news from a roof accident.

70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	You will be in a considerable amount of pain...of course it will also depend on how much digging the oral surgeon has to do to get them out and what kind of drugs he or she prescribes for you afterwards.    After my wisdom teeth removal, I was on Vicodin and Percocet and it didn't take away a lot of the pain.  My face was swollen for about 3 days and I couldn't eat solid food for about that long, either.  I just sat in my Lay-Z-Boy with an ice-cold rag on my jaws all day and watched DVDs.  Talking was also out of the question.|`|u1uECuFNaa	The pain is manageable. You should be able to stay at a friends'.    Depends on what dentist you have.  Why you are having them out also.

To help - take some advil or tylenol prior to having it pulled and after wards - be careful - if the novocaine or anesthetic is still working, you will have some problems swallowing the pills. I dribbled a lot, then bit my tongue and only felt part of it, did not realize it was bleeding. Avoid "hard" food for a day or too while the hole heals and rinse out your mouth often. It can cause the side of your face to swell a little too.|`|kM9xoajHaa	when i got mind out i went home until i was not in pain|`|iAAS3GwXaa	one thing to say your cheeks will be swollen|`|X9cGsOq8aa	when they did that to me afterwards i want in pain and went out to a friends party! i was and im still 15!

vm1Fj2AVaa	I am doing it now. Todays challenge was the forgiveness one. It is a GREAT book and a GREAT thing for marriages in trouble. I watched the movie and ordered the book the next day. It definately helps to see the movie first. I was able to get my husband to go. I didn't think he would, but he is ,after his affair, to make me happy. We were the only ones in the theatre and instead of jumping up when it was over he put his arm around me and held me for a minute. If your marriage is in trouble, no matter what the reason, get the book and try it. If anything can work, it is this!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	My hubby watched the movie and it made him cry! I still haven't seen it but I've only heard great things about it.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Ask your local library to buy the book. They have a budget for that.|`|SiniSj1eaa	thank you for describing what this is!! I may have to look into this!|`|Rl2VamIRaa	where do i find this book my marriage is falling apart or the movie please let me know|`|5k7BexD3aa	This movie was actually made in my hometown in GA.  I LOVED it.  It certainly makes you appreciate what you have!!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	No I have not, but the movie was awesome.  I watched one night while my husband was on CQ and I made him watch it the next night with me.  I think we're going to buy the book.  We have a great marriage, but there is ALWAYS room for improvement.  Plus we need to get closer to God as a couple.        You can buy the book new for $8.24 on amazon.|`|LwstxBm4aa	I just watched that movie last week, and I wanted to take the Love Dare sooooooooooo bad, but when I looked online for it, you had to purchase it. I am still debating to buy it or not.     as for the movie being helpful, it was for me, but hubby wouldn't watch it with me. but just like the movie said, if we do our part to try to do whats right, the other half will follow, right?
AA11097612	Since your father is all grown up I suppose he is allowed to live his life and spend his money as he sees fit.  It is probably true that he doesn't need to seek your permission to do things or spend his money in any certain way.      Stop trying to control your dad's life.  Maintain a relationship with him as best as you can and treat him as well as possible.  He will need you when the realities of this relationship present themselves.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	I would take him out to dinner alone and talk to him and tell him but you know what it is going to make problems. But then again let him do what makes him happy he will find out the hard way trust. I didn't like my moms boyfriend because i just didn't want her to be with nobody so i told my cousins to handle him so the did and we never seen him again. Well now i notice my mom sad as hell because that's what made her happy and i feel bad but im also happy. i was being so selfish but it hurted so bad seeing her with someone.|`|e2ccfda0779d310e0b3d6d1cdc69d2d1aa	That's the price he gets for buying a wife.So he is stuck with her.|`|47Et6CaHaa	tell her to **** off, she sounds like a little whore|`|GmTMVmASaa	if your dad is happy with her, even if all she does is spend his money and lie around in pajamas all day, then let it be.if it doesn't bother him, then it shouldn' bother you. as for her cold nature, perhaps she suspects your dislike?  as for the age difference, so what? befriend her then, or try to.|`|9kos1a8Jaa	I am surprised some what of this abnormal behavior for a vietnam immigrant.  I thought they worked like dogs?!?  It seems like your dad took the opportunity to spoil her rotten, first by bringing her to America the most spoiled country in the world (my personal opinion), then by making certain that she is a designer gluten and probably has molded her to do 'ANYTHING' for money. In addition, he has allowed her to be lazy and do...well.. nothing ( as long as he is gettin sex any way he can...he is happy man). A normal man usually will not deal with a woman who is not delivering or helping out in the home, he either cheats, finds a way out, or staight out leaves.    Regardless, this is your father's personal problem and it does not seem to bother him much if he is the main contributer (he obviously has much to learn if he is on wife number 3..lol). This is his wife, whether you like it or not. No one said you had to like her, just respect her if she respects you.  If she does not respect you, stand up and let her know what she says offends you. Tell dad that you refuse to visit or invite him until she learns to respect you and your father while in your presence. This may be the first 'eye opener' for dad to see through his spoiled wife!|`|2t62ETgEaa	Are you included in whatever agreements they have made as husband and wife.Unless you know their "pillow talk" don't worry about it.As long as he is happy don't worry about.If he starts showing signs of not being happy then talk to him alone about it..|`|jXD8eBFgaa	Your father met  real gold digger,watch and learn .How much did she want?
AA12268495	Seriously??? Absolutely NOT. I'm sure she is planning some last ditch effort to make a pass at you. Did she actually say, "one last visit"? That screams of desperation ~ and showing up, even if you do nothing, would simply give her some unrealistic hope.     I mean, she can't help having a crush on you ~ but even if she doesn't have something sneaky up her sleeve, it's best to just let it be. And let her move on. The best way is by simply turning down her offer for a visit.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	why would you go? What could she possibly have to say to you now that you are getting married? Honor your wife to be and sever ties with the woman. Sounds like she is trying to stir up trouble if you ask me.     I would be ticked if my fiance went over to say "goodbye" to a former crush. It would damage our relations and create an element of distrust.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	no        no no no no no no no no no      just plain NO|`|d3VBC36Paa	y not, ur just going to say bye, i mean if is just on the freind status, if u had something with her i recomend dont go|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	No, it shouldn't affect you at all that someone has a crush on you.  you are getting married and that should be your focus.|`|q8eue7CRaa	"One last visit"???? No, don't jeopardize your marriage! It'll be easier for your crush and you to just leave it as it is. I'm not sure if I understand why you're still talking to her in this sort of level still.. focus your time and energy on your engagement and your fiance, not your crush.|`|em0VhxyOaa	i would not go over for the last time and i would just call her and tell her wat u think and just cut it off with her though with out going over ther|`|wwB3csfYaa	You really should not go. Really should not.   Do not go.  I said good-bye once to the guy that loved me more then life, and it was really akward and I WISH to GOD I didn't because he ended being so sad, then after a few days he turned bitter and phyco and he almost ruined my wedding.   I don't think she's intrested in "goodbye" I think she wants to know if she has a chance with you. People get a little phyco in these despert situations. She'll def. cry hestericly and BEG you not to get married and tell you she's actually in love with you then once you tell her your plans are set in stone and getting married is what you want she might do something CRAZY at your wedding.|`|AA10441482	The fact that you are even questioning this makes me wonder if your ready to get married. Why would you want to see another woman when your getting married?! Almost positive this wouldn't be an innocent visit. . .     My suggestion is if you insist on meeting for a "final goodbye" meet with the woman and with you future wife. IF you can't do that they you shouldn't be meeting with this other woman.|`|IUgkylWqaa	Why were you "visiting" her when you were seeing someone else during the whole time anyway?|`|76nTvO4iaa	No.    What are you hoping to accomplish by doing this?  Give her one last chance to make a fool of herself by declaring her everlasting love for you?    Stay home.|`|0Id85yiYaa	no
279a30474c1f2139cd647756a7ab8d69aa	BS to the guys here - and all over the world - who says it's a turnoff and phony.  These are the same guys who are addicted to all the magazines and online sites like ask.com.  The majority of those women are enhanced.  Men can't have it both ways... idiots.|`|CE4hcUmhaa	Absolutely hate fake boobs, always have, probably always will.  They are easy to spot, and nowadays are signs of massive personal insecurity, and a woman looking for a quick fix to her perceived problems.    Plastic surgery in the context of accident or cancer victims is one thing, but the generic boob job is just pointless.    I have had the privilege to examine thousands of breasts, one dollar at a time, and the profusion of fake boobs is truly an indication of the decline of  the American woman.    The implants may look great when clothed, but when exposed (the moment of truth!) the scars, loss of nipple sensitivity, visible seams and creases from the bags themselves, are not worth the cost.    Find the perfect bra, buy clothes that fit, and exercise to stay in shape- you will look better and have a greater sense of self worth than buying some bags.|`|4Vchxp32aa	yes because it's not the real person.  Plus, I prefer small boobs to big ones.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	the more deformed the better|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Yes it's a turn off unless it's to repair damage. Breast augmentation looks so phony.|`|W618lfZ6aa	It depends on the type, if it's because the person was in a horrific accident, then yeah not a problem.  If they are doing it to be "hot" then I find it stupid.|`|dDSuBQURaa	As long he doesn't look like Michael Jackson, then he is fine.|`|AA10074712	Yup, absolutely. If I go out with a woman, it should be a woman, not something where ya can't go too close to the heat cause there's a risk it'll melt :)|`|QINXWKPUaa	turn off! i like my men natural, people shouldn't have to alter their bodys, you were born a certain way for a reason to be you!|`|vS3C3dAkaa	Plastic surgery is not a turn off though you should spend the money and get a good job and not go overboard.     I am all for enhancement! Have fun live large!    Mark|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	HUGE turn off..when you feel a womans fake breats its disgusting and it looks terrible if its too much..just like those Orange looking women that tan too much YUCK!! those girls with those lips that look like the were sucking on doorknobs and we expct them to droll when talking,,are pathetic..what is in their mings thinking they look better..shallow and vain women that need to tan all thime are huge turn offs..I will a natural nbeauty any day..girl with no make up beautiful hair and smile in jeans t shirt and ball cap and then can dress up in the sexiest outfit in minutes nt house geting reay..natural beauty is the best..live with what God gave ya...someone will love you just the way you are..|`|Z6SFDLZcaa	It depends on what they getting done .but shouldnt go over the top with it
QsbB6vkoaa	you must get a backbone, and force yourself not to say anything you don't want to say. never compromise yourself by trying to please other people. it never works and it leaves you feeling very empty. if they really were good friends you wouldn't feel intimidated by them. i always hear a lot of gossip and sometimes it's hard for me to keep quiet. i don't know how old you are , but i assume, you are still very young. when i was younger and i gossiped it made me feel part of the group, but after-wards i felt horrible for spilling someone else's secrets. now that i'm older, my best friends are my mom, my sister and my husband. so any time i feel like i have to spill a secret i tell one of them, and that way when i talk to someone else i don't feel the pressure of telling anyone else. i would suggest for you to build a friendship with your mom, it might sound a bit awkward. but it's the best thing you can do. just start off by saying to her "mom, i have a question for you. when you were young did you feel the pressure to?" and then just tell her the story. she will give you the best advice since, she obviously is the one person who doesn't want to see you in awkward situations.|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	Be your own person and do not let them take advantage of you that way.|`|wTMMG0enaa	oh, i've been in this situation...sounds like your friends are evil master manipulators. really, you need to get new friends and tell a trusted adult about you situation they'll know how to deal with them. real friends wouldn't treat you this way. and if they still try to get info. out of you and make fun of you after you stop hanging around them or whatever  just ignore them and try to make them look really stupid, form your own group of friends then all of you could pick on your evil manipulating ex-friends unless things get to out of hand, tell an adult about it then maybe you could move to a different school?|`|51ne4RkHaa	you need to stand up to yourself.. be tough|`|7mjB9maOaa	It is hard for most people, including me, to be able to confront people about things you don't like that they do. What I would do if I were you, is I'd ask them to please stop next time they start bugging you about a question. Try to get some backbone and tell them that you're not willing to answer, and you'd like it if they'd stop squeezing answers out of you all the time. If they're good friends, they'll understand that they're hurting you, so try to just be polite.|`|SBMxJdyraa	look they all love you and try to be a bit confident...............tell them tat even u wanna noe bout dem nd deir secrets nd u really appreciate dem but its not dun dey shud tell u more bout themselves...........learn deir ways ...............notice carefully how dey tok 2 u nd try nd do de same..............it will work........nd if it doesnt mail me back i'll try 2 help u..............|`|kJeRAg5Kaa	well this is an art some ppl are born with.if u feel you are being ill treated by them then u are with a wrong group of friends.find another group who respects you for what you are|`|cGlVzud8aa	have you tried talking to they about this? its clearly upsetting you and if they aren't willing to stop, then sorry but they aren't true friends|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	Get a backbone!|`|BkOgWbg6aa	Yea let your buddies know whats up and if they get defense well sweetheart its time to get some new friends|`|2d8c9bc0469baeffd9fca823fb022132aa	They aren't your friends and they are definitely using you! Friends are people who are there for you, who care about you... friends should never make you feel like you feel. Sounds to me like "The Popular Crowd". Man I am so happy to be done high school. Watch "Mean Girls" lol. Any way good luck to you, I hope you realize they aren't real friends and find someone who will treat you fairly and care about you.|`|48m0Ls7gaa	do not listen to her|`|2SgkewSJaa	Tell Them In Private who your feeling about this so It wont seem as hard.But I recommend you get yourself some new friends in the mean time darling .

I am sure they'd tell you if you asked them something. :)
htSZsds7aa	Stay married for the kids, dont cheat, get marriage counciling.  If your kids are the main thing, then divorce and a girlfriend is out of the question. stick it out till they are 18.|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	Why not address your marriage situation first to see if its even salvagable.  You are too quick to dismiss your wife and move on to someone who catches your eye.  Why not try counseling and some other things to bring the spark back into your marriage.  Sometimes people get too comfortable with each other.  Before you throw in the towel, for the kids sake as well as your own, give you wife a chance.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	You should ask your wife to go to marriage counseling, or you  should throw yourself into your marriage full force.    Send your wife flowers.    Take her to nice restaurants.    Buy her a few nice gifts here and there.    See what happens...you could find out that you love her  more than you thought once you see her reactions from  being treated so well.    If you do all of the above and the spark does not come back,  then you will know that you are better off as friends.    Either way, make sure that the relationship is amicable.    You owe that much to the kids.    Best wishes    BTW: The girl at work is just a deterrent that you are using to  avoid facing the sadness of the way that your marriage is going.  Sleeping with her is not the answer. Work relationships can mess  up your employment.|`|AA10886262	rekindle the love for your wife...you have only been married three years, surely you didn't marry her and not love her...of course your love changes after kids and 3 years, spend the energy on your marriage; that's what is best for the kids|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	First try counseling to see if you can find that spark. If that doesn't work, you can divorce knowing you tried your best.  Kids are miserable when their parents are miserable, so  2 is not an option. And  3, that's just pathetic.   Always finish a current relationship before starting a new one- wait until the divorce is final before getting involved.    I feel sorry for your wife, she probably has no clue there's something wrong. Are you sure you aren't letting your lust overshadow your love for her?|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	:( sorry you are so torn.     I am 'the girl at the office' and it does bother me that this man i am involved with is in the same situation you are in....it hurts like hell to know he is in pain over our affair...and that he is not in love and longs for more....and does not want to hurt his kids.. and that it is inevitable that somebody will get hurt :(        I have no answer for your question...|`|FHu7pHhRaa	I would ignore the feelings and go on the way you have been. Wait a few months and really try to get those feelings back for your wife. If you still can't then talk to your wife about it and ask her what she thinks would be best for your kids. If she really doesnt feel the same way about you anymore, and she agrees on something that wouldnt hurt your kids, then get a divorce.  Be sure that the person at work won't cheat on you though, and leave you unloved.  x|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Kids who grow up with parents who don't love each other find themselves thinking that it is normal.    Try to work on the relationship.  What made you fall in love with your wife in the first place?    Cheating on your wife is not what's best for your family.  It's selfish.    You need to try to improve your relationship with your wife, it's what's best for the kids.  If that goes nowhere, separate.  Don't drown the kids in the aftermath of cheating on your wife.|`|v6MvF2Mgaa	Keep it in your pants sparky! Even if you decide to cheat, you shouldn't do it with someone at work. People who do that get caught about 90% of the time! Never s hit where you eat!    Not to mention if you get a divorce, your wife will end up with full custody of the kids and you will be paying about 50-60% of your gross income on child support and alimony. Bottom line, it's cheaper to keep her!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Get a divorce. However the grass isn't always  greener on the septic tank.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Dude, you just said that the girl at the office doesn't seem to mind that you are married!!  What does that say about her?  Well let me explain it to you,  She is a LOSER!  She has no morals and no integrity what so ever.  Why would you want a woman like that?  So you are going to lose your whole family for some skank?|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Please do not cheat. Go watch the movie fireproof and take the love dare, if after that you still dont feel any diffrent you can leave whats a few more days after as long as you have been married. if you wont do it for her try it for the kids at lesat. I saved my marriage. you can save yours , i tried this when i thought there was no hope and it worked|`|Nq8fhhRPaa	Love is not a feeling, it is a choice. I think the book The Love Dare would be a great place for you to start learning how to love your wife again. Once you start choosing to love your wife the "feelings" will follow. Divorce will not only hurt your wife and kids but you as well. Please consider the book and marriage counseling before you consider divorce.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Divorce|`|ad153b7afea3d1e4c3bb669e8b8bf28faa	man up - get some therapy, go to church, see the movie FIREPROOF, whatever it takes! my point is that there will be stuff no matter who you are with. maybe different stuff but still stuff! man up and be the husband and father you are suppose to be! instead of seeing her faults, work on your own. i think you will be surprised. stay away from the girl at the office.|`|AA11731307	Don't cheat, you don't want your kids to feel that you left your family for another woman.  What about a legal separation?  Talk to your wife maybe she feels the same way.|`|AA11156037	Option   2 but get counseling.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The ideal situation is for your kids to be raised by their biological parents but staying together for the sake of the kids when no one is happy is only a disaster waiting to happen. Dont get involved in a affair as this willonly complicate things at home so if youre hell bent on seeing this girl at work then end your marriage.Your kids will survive a divorce far better than living in an unhappy household. But now if your marriage is just fine, dont destroy it just becuse of some pipe dream with this girl or youll really end up miserable and will lose all the way around. Your choice, good luck|`|Ow5gSrAQaa	go to counseling and sort out your problems before you cheat, stay or leave your wife.  you need to get your problems resolve before you move on or else it will follow you whoever you go. of course, we all get tempted from time to time.  it doesn't mean it's ok to cheat.  let her know how you feel.  communicate, communicate and see what happens.|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	Kids will NEVER be happy if there mother and father are not "happy" together, A divorce should also be your last choice. I believe you married your wife for a reason, and most likely that reason was true LOVE, and maybe over the years you have grown apart.     My advice to you is, to work on your marriage. Try to work it out, you can even take a weekend get away. Seek help and after you'll try your very best and fought for you marriage, and it "still isn't working" then think of divorce because you shouldn't remain unhappy.     But please don't run to divorce, or another women because it would hurt your wife and your kids more then you can think of. Also the woman you find your self  "attracted" to knows your married and doesn't seem to mind. Sound like someone with very little respect to her self and much less respect to your wife and kids.     Just think of it this way, if that woman were to ever become your wife and she finds her self being "attracted" to another man at work or at any other place, I guess she "wouldn't mind" that she marriage and cheat on you.     Show the kind of woman she is and the kind of wife she'll be. You also see the value of marriage to her, and would she be a good step mother to your kids ? Don't leave GOLD for something worthless, or take a 30 second  joy ride and lose a lifetime of happiness.      Good Luck and think before you act !|`|4C9U3Xh6aa	We all get those feelings. Like we find ourselves no longer in love with our spouse and we get this wonderful feeling when we tend to look elsewhere, But, trust me Its not worth it. Try to do things with your wife that will bring that spark back. Its just a stage that we go threw. If you work past it you will realize how could you be with out her.     If you did leave her you will not be happy. For the simple fact that you see your kids unhappy. And for the other women, Its just the attention she likes that you are giving her.   Hold on to what you have, We don't appreciate what we have until its gone.  I hope it works out for you.|`|mxkzFBS6aa	Try and work on your marriage. Trust me, the grass is def. not greener on the other side of the fence. In the long run having an affair will only make you feel worse about yourself when you realize you've made a huge mistake. Once you make that step you can't rewind time and fix it. I think that girl at work is a big part of the problem if she's making you reevaluate your marriage. It never hurts to try counseling and if that doesn't work then you and your wife should work out a solution together. Try that movie Fireproof....I'm going to watch it soon myself:) Good luck and keep your faith in God to help you through this.
VWueB85zaa	she isnt worth it. her life is already torn up anyway. she just need help. if you ever tried talking to her? i know it may feel uncomfortable; nevermind! stratch the talking part! if she need something, help her and if she disrespect you in a rude way, stand up for yourself! i hope this can help you. if not dont talk to her. good luck ;D|`|z2DmmhqJaa	I didn't read any of that.

WSkH6LaZaa	It is hard to say, could be the women want to stick buy their vows and are still in love with their husbands.  Could be they are blind   But it could be If they divorce their life wouldn't have all the drama they are craving.   Do you see how they told you about their lives and and how you reacted. It made them feel like they were important. They might have already known before marriage how their husbands are.   Stop worring about them and live your life. Its ok they will be fine.|`|v6MvF2Mgaa	Not sure but one thing is for certain. It's always best to MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS! Worry about your own marriage, not others.|`|pma90Xycaa	Yikes!  It's harder on a military base because everything is such close quarters.  But in general, the reasons that women stay vary.  Just because a man strays once doesn't mean that he's necessarily going to do it again.  Maybe the woman wants to make things work.  There's nothing wrong with trying...but there is a problem if she lets it happen again and again.|`|07f8af82c44cad0ad314af70c5b88735aa	Gail is an A$$.  Hope you catch every STD available.

Most people keep all the cheating a secret.|`|0Id85yiYaa	some women stand by their vows through anything. i sometimes think marriage deserves a second change when infidelity, but sometimes women are just blind.|`|4a14dfd051c9e1157b10bc5abd40a5faaa	Stupidity|`|R4F05z4Faa	wife and husband is a wheels of two. if partner cheated , throw outside .|`|hXQjnPuGaa	People cheat, get over it.|`|tsBL19qzaa	They are weak women.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	You really have to be in that persons shoes, with the history of that person's experiences to truly understand how they see things.     I've seen husband and wives go through this all the time... sometimes the marriage is worth saving and they go on to be married for 20+ years...and sometimes it only gets worse and leads to divorce anyway.     Everybody's got a story, and in the end, the only people that should be invovled are the two people who said I do (period).     You'll never know what you'll do until you are face with it yourself.   In the end, the only person that ever completely told the truth was time... so let time tell.|`|yy45iAbtaa	they are using the children as excuses.they stay because they are insecure and feel that nobody else would want them.but that is not true and you need to help them realize that.they also might stay because they think they can't make it on there own and they are scared little do they no they do it on there own anyway.there husbands are gone most of the time.|`|WzY2WhGhaa	Sometimes because they don't know who else they can go to...or they have noone else. Some wives (and husbands) are very forgiving and want to work things through and move on. Unfortunately there are good and bad things about that...and when there is another person involved who got pregnant by your spouse, it makes things all the more difficult. It can be very hard for others to understand-- I wouldn't want to stay in a marriage where my husband cheated and I'm sure he wouldn't stick around if I cheated either. To me, sexual infidelity is the worst thing that could happen, but some women are able to see through it. It's a matter of personal choice.

mvKDbb2uaa	It sounds like you should move on.  Don't stay in this relationship just because it's comfortable.  If you are questioning your life, then there's a reason why--maybe you aren't entirely happy with it or this relationship, maybe you want more out of it and are looking for more.  If that's the case, don't sell yourself short on this one.|`|0Id85yiYaa	move on. don't get married until you're 100% sure.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Sounds like it is time to move on. If you are questioning who you want to be with, then you're not ready to commit for life. Break the news to your fiance as soon as possible.|`|7foornMVaa	You need to pick a  date with him. If he blows you off or beats around the bush then I would take it as a sign to move on.    Good luck|`|2rsiKfj7aa	I was in a previous relationship and it was basically the same way. Long engagement and all. I new deep in my heart that it wasn't right. We canceled and now I have met my prince charming! Been married 2 years and love it!    If there is any doubt do not do it! When you are ready to be married...you know it! Good luck whichever way you decide.|`|AA11603468	I wouldn't get married with that kind of doubt on my mind. When you're 100% sure, that's when you marry-not a minute before.|`|bVIewZe9aa	follow your heart.  maybe you both want different things.  maybe you both want to be with each other for the rest of your lives.  don't make a decision that you'll regret.  Emma (:|`|A6MQuHfbaa	decide what you want before you get married.|`|7AeSRNWgaa	wow, that's a long engagement...    um, why not just postpone it until you figure it out?|`|TM9N4FKXaa	The best thing is to really figure out if this is what you really want and if you have to keep questioning yourself  then its no point of staying in the relationship|`|E7LQp6VRaa	If you are having second thoughts about marrying him, then I agree it is time for you to move on.  Not only for your sake, but for his.    If you were to get married feeling this way then you would have an unhappy marriage that would end in divorce and you don't need that.. life is too short...     I would sit down and talk to him and just be honest with him about how you feel and what you want.    Good Luck|`|vlEeaB4baa	Better think about it really hard before you get married.  Sounds like you may be having second thoughts.  It's a lot harder to get out of a marriage than it is to get married.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Discuss this with a trained counselor. You should go alone and then with your fiancee. You could just have cold feet - not uncommon - or you could be drifting apart. In all fairness to him, at least give counseling a try.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	You are not ready for marriage if I felt that way I would wait and see if things change instead of making a mistake.
AGbusTqGaa	I'm pretty sure it only becomes a legal issue if the guy is 18 or older.  You guys are only a year a part, you should be fine.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I live in Missouri.. when you turn 16 legally you can date anyone under 21.. and when you turn 17 feel free to do whoever. Don't know about how your parents will feel though. good luck.|`|UbR8EfMxaa	i heard 13. maybe they changed the law|`|6UDxXsieaa	http://teenadvice.about.com/library/week...|`|SZdVYrSSaa	If you are still together when he turns 18, it is not illegal for him to date you, see you, take you out, he can even kiss you. And for the most part, since you are just a little less than two years apart, the law will overlook most violations beyond that as well, due to your proximity in age. The legality issue between a minor and an adult pertains only to sex. As long as the two of you aren't having sex, then you can date all you want.    I actually dated a 17 year old when I was 20 for about a year, and so long as we didn't converge sexually, there was absolutely no law against it. He consented to my attention, and I very legally conducted a relationship with him that cannot be suspect without physical intervention.
XRn0Ai3Naa	I say wait til your 18 and change it its not bad nobody even uses the middle name.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	when we named our daughter we gave her two names so when she got older she could use ether.   It is a pain to change a name as you have to go to court and a lot of legal work in involved|`|GsrLh50laa	It's only about $20 dollars to legally change your name. If you prepare the forms yourself all you'd have to pay is your state's filing fee. You can get everything you need to legally change your name at - http://www.legalformsbank.biz/namechange...|`|wFN8bVqsaa	We've all been there, hating that middle name. I could not stand mine for the longest time. I think you should reconsider changing it. It's original and your parents had a reason for picking it for you. How would you feel if you named your child something and they changed it? Plus, it's just a middle name after all. I think you should embrace the uniqueness and coolness of it. If it's a plain name and you want to change it to something more unique and cool, just make up a cool nickname for yourself instead. I hated mine, but now I like it because it is what I was given. If you are absolutely hating your middle name and have thought about it a ton, I am sure your parents would understand if you talked to them open-hearted about it. Good luck!|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	I used to hate my middle name but now I like it. My given name is Tammy Sue...not Tamara...so my brothers would call me like they were on a farm and calling a pig or something. It was so annoying. My little Brother still calls me Tammy Sue and after I grew up and found out that it was my dad who picked the name I became more accepting of it. My mom wanted to name me Victoria Elizabeth. How stuffy is that?     I named my oldest daughter Bridgette Rae and she hated her name...she said it was a boys name and I tried to explain it was rae like sunshine....kids teased her too until now she is an adult and she loves her name.     So give it a chance. If when you are an adult, you still hate your name so much that you want to change it then do so. It is a court visit and some legal papers to do it. But most people don't even care or even know what your middle name is so I think you should leave it alone.|`|GTZa0H9waa	Like these other answers,yeah it seems like you should accept it or wait until your 18.I got teased so much in elementary school and middle school about my middle name,like seriously I went home crying some days because what kids said were hurtful.I look at it now and it was stupid,because my middle name isn't even bad.When I was younger I HATED to tell people my middle name and I never did I lied and said "oh I don't have a middle name" then people beat it out of me and eventually when people asked I just said it and I didn't care what they had to say about it,my mom picked it for a very good reason,she was 16 when she had me so you know she thought of the names and I thought they were plain old names but there were meanings behind it.    so this is my name Nicole Brianna Blossom.  Nicole she just liked that name.  Brianna was her best friend,and she stood by her side when she was pregnant even though she was only 16  and Blossom was my great grandmothers name.    over time I said screw people it's just a middle name.I actually have grown to like mine.so you really either have the option to wait til your 18 to get it fixed or just embrace it,im sure it's not even that bad!
BkMjabPvaa	i would say BESTIE|`|XnNRRuGnaa	your ex boyfriend is expected to lie to it just comes with the letters e and x but your best friend shouldn't lie to you and if he/she is lieing to you a lot then they are not really a best friend xx hope this helps xx :] :]
bKK2fPiVaa	Absolutely!  I did mine in 4 months and it was great.  See if you can find "Wedding Planning for the Working Woman" (the title is something like that anyway) and it's a great step-by-step guide.  It was a lifesaver for me as I did it by myself!  Just remember to have lots of fun!|`|ifgzHzA3aa	That's plenty of time.  First thing, make the guest list.  Then get on the phone and start calling, to get your venue.  After your venue is set, get calling for the rest.  You just have to get on things.  Make lists and get something accomplished each day.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	We are getting married on 6th June also and it has taken me from last June to organise it.

Figure out what you would like, who you want there and how big your budget is going to be.  But if you want it by this June, you need to start immediately.|`|4SjwTCASaa	Start planning right away and start with the big things (location, food if catered, DJ, Flowers and dresses)  All of these things are usually booked way in advance and as for the dresses, they usually take a couple of months to get.|`|pqIBeXsRaa	Weddings can be big, and there's a lot that goes along with them. To plan something by June, you'll need to start soon. Here are some tips to help you along:    Get the biggest things done first, such as clothing (bridal gown, bridesmaid's dresses, tuxedos, etc.). You'll need to start on your dress soon, since you'll need several fittings to get it right. You'll also want your shoes and underclothes for the fittings, since that's what you'll be wearing on the Big Day.     Try to get a fitting once you have all your gear. Get another about two months before the wedding, and a third about two weeks before the wedding. If you're planning on losing weight before the wedding, you'll want to make sure and get at least that many fittings, if not more.     Many florists like to book you 3-4 months in advance, varying for each company, so you'll want to get those booked soon. Florists also like to meet in person with their clients, so try and get an appointment ASAP to discuss your ideas.    Bakeries for wedding cakes often want a couple months notice and contract in advance as well. Meeting with your baker to discuss the cake you would like is a good idea.     Make sure to get all the services you need, such as catering, hair and makeup, and photography booked ASAP. You can ask friends and family for references.    To help you get started, you might want to decide on wedding colors or theme, if you want one. You can use the following sites for ideas, inspiration, and getting the items you'll need:    http://www.brides.com/    http://thebridescafe.com/    http://theknot.com/    http://www.weddingbee.com/    http://www.etsy.com/    http://finestationery.blogspot.com/    Also, browse the internet and bridal magazines to help you get ideas and to get some companies you might want to use.     Wish you the best of luck! Hope this was helpful.     J|`|WROvNbBsaa	I agree with many of the posts above. Get all the major items out of the way.  Recruit help!

Why spend the money and torture her with something frilly that she'll only wear one time?|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	At 6 months she is not likely to look anything other than completely beautiful whatever dress you put her in.

We have a couple near me and they always have really cute outfits there, including a few christening gowns.    That way you wouldn't be spending a fortune on a new gown and you can shop pretty close to the wedding, since they grow so much at that age.|`|7cdfc5d9a205827b098980cae58531dbaa	just find a dress in which she looks cute. she doesn't need to be formal. she would be lovely and everyone would like that.

tGlnumvKaa	You should report the abuse to the police, or at the very least one of your teachers or a family member!  There is no excuse for a parent to beat the crap out of a child. Have a doctor to look at your hip, it could be dislocated. If it is, and it isn't treated it could cause you problems for the rest of your life.     When you tell him you're moving have someone there with you. Whether it's a neighbor, cop, counselor, social worker, friends or family members who will report it if he goes off on you. Having someone there might prevent him from attacking you again. If he does, you will have a witness.    Does he ever leave the house? If so, you could move your stuff out while he's gone then tell him by phone or send him an email. Anyone who abuses their child doesn't deserve the respect of being told anything in person.    Tell him that you're trying to better your life and you can't do it there. Remind him that it's your life and it's your decision. You are an adult now, you are at least 18, right?  He should be proud of you for finishing high school early and for wanting to continue your education. Hell, I'm proud of you and I don't even know you!     Anyway, you sound like you're on the right track with the school.  I know it will be hard to get up the courage to tell him you're leaving. But once you're gone, you will feel much better.     I wish you luck on your studies and your life.|`|QINXWKPUaa	Well if my father did that to me i wouldn't need a nice peaceful way to say im moving out....or if your the other type of person i would just be like hey after high school usually everyone moves on with their lives and start growing up so im moving out.|`|TycEvdg0aa	Move out.  But temporarily. He will soon know of your value.  Although if that is impossible why don't you discuss your problems with him but first make him swear not to get restless or angry. May be he would understand and then try to improve. If he doesn't get an immediate positive response THEN move out.|`|IczYnBelaa	Dude, get out on your own.., He'll never change.. I'm taking it he drinks alot???? My mother was like that. I left home after highschool too. I learned the hard way in life because of it, but, today i'm a better man because of it. Try joining the military?????|`|qHEpR92Gaa	1Intention: Be clear on what your intentions are in your confrontation. Are you trying to express an emotion, do you want to change another persons behavior, or do you just want to get back at someone? The intention from which you approach the situation can have a large impact on the outcome.   Step2Plan Ahead: Decide what you are going to say and when you are going to say it. Timing is key. Its probably not a great idea to confront someone in the middle of an argument. That will just make things worse. If youre trying to create change confronting someone in an arguement wont be the way to do it.   Step3Keep it Short, Simple, and Nonjudgmental: Say what the behavior was that bothered you, why it bothered you and the effect it had on you. Use facts, not judgments. State if there is an alternative that you would prefer or the consequence if the behavior continues.   Step4Rehearse it: Remember the important components that you would like to address.     Here is an easy model to follow based on the previous step:   "When you were late these last two times to go to the movies [Identifying the behavior], I missed part of the movie [Stating the impact of the behavior] and was disappointed and frustrated [Expressing your feelings about the situation]. If we are going to go to the movies again together, I want to be on time or else I cant go to the movies with you anymore [Stating an alternative and expressing the consequence]."   Step5Stay Focused: If the other person begins to bring up other examples of unrelated or mildly related items refocus on the discussion at hand. For instance, dont get caught up in defending yourself about an issue. That can be resolved later. Simply say Its important we address that, but now I want us to focus on what I just brought up. We can talk about that when were done with this discussion. This gives you the power in the conversation and forces the person to take accountability for their behavior.   Step6Be Open to Problem Solving: Allow for the other person to express themselves. You may be playing a part in the situation; perhaps there are changes you can make in regards to the problem. Be a part of the solution and don't forget to be receptive to feedback.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	As you have had physical contacts with each other I would suggest that you pack and have it all out of the house and when the day comes tell him from across the room that you are leaving and will stay in touch and walk out the door unless he is coming after you and then I would tell you to run|`|j3U6zjHzaa	You need to say: Hey Dad , I am sick of you abusing and physically hurting me. Then tell him that you are going to spend some time outta his house. Hopefully he won't go off. If it gets worse talk to an adult about it and contact Childrens Services.

AA10199189	ok, first of all it is not up to "god" and if you need any more proof think about the 14 kids that screwed up woman in california has.    you have to get counselling for the two of you or you will split and then there is your child to consider.  you both have to arrive at the same decision about more children.  it probably is not in your best interest to have more children, esp. when your doctor told you you would need help.  you will be playing with fire if you try to get pregnant and suffer serious consequences.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	don't get yourself fixed - who knows what you want years from now, just take necessary precautions|`|YDoYBdTUaa	no of course not, it is your body and you dont have to do anything to it that you dont agree with. you should talk about this with him and see if you are looking for the same things in this relationship. but do not do something that you will regret. if he doesnt want anymore children then the obvious far less drastic option is contraception and that way you dont completely diminish the thought of more children in the future when he may have changed his mind.   hope that helped.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	No your right and a man's recovery time is a lot shorter than a woman's.|`|z7rN4Bokaa	Not only is it your body, but it's your religious belief.

Also remember that no matter what measures are taken, all birth control has a possibility of failure..so have that "what if" discussion with your partner.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	see ur gynac|`|IczYnBelaa	Birth control, condoms, abstinence... In worst case senario, he can get a vasectomy, it's cheap, and reversable.|`|cp4hjnZoaa	Hi Ola,              It's a simple process in this modern times. First of all don't be stressed out about not to have children. But, be aware the same time. During intercourse, the primary precautionary measure is avoid orgasm inside. Usually, most couples prefer condom but at times it prevents intimacy. So, have I-pill capsules to use if needed. In case, if it happens take a pill within 72 hours. But, don't use over dosage. Moreover, pregnancy happens only during 10 to 15 days in a month. Other dates are almost safe for intercourse. No need to be planned. Apart from that, you can alternate between different methods for uninterrupted pleasure which won't cause pregnancy. It will serve as a variant in your life. So be happy and enjoy your married life. Best wishes. :-)
b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Lets see if I cn help here. First,respond by stating shes counter suing for divorce and she will send a list of her demands to his lawyer. She should have already received a copy of his suit with his demands which she can use by either agreeing or disagreeing with each demand seperately and stating what she wants. You dont necessarily need a lawyer here as you guys can figure out what she wants and communicate that to his lawyer. Learn to barter here as he wants the divorce so lets see what hes willing to give up to get the divorce. His demands are not etched in stone so they can be altered or changed as needed. Because of different states involved here this will take a little longer but just how bad does he really want this divorce?  Time is on your side here. Yes if he can prove mental instability on her in court he will receive custody but she can go for visitations at his expense. Tell him she wants spoual support if she does or not get child custody and how much. You can also request he continue paying for her medical insurance. Like I said before you guys just need to find out just how bad he wants out and that his existing this marriage is going to cost him. If you guys have any more questions or concerns my email address is   thunder_wright@yahoo.com    and Im willing tio help you all as much as Im allowed to. Just dont agree nor sign anything from him or his attorney without first checking with me first or else the courts cant overturn any agreement agreed upon outside the courtroom. Good luck|`|bO2rzfISaa	IMO he's doing the same thing you in her family are doing: abandoning her in her time of need.    I don't see how he can divorce her when she's incompetant to represent herself or make a decision about the divorce.    Have you tried to get her help for the divorce through Legal Aid?    Also, there are attorneys who fight disability denials and charge nothing unless you are approved.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	I would contact the military, she should be getting a lawyer as well as him from his benefits.  I would also get this story public, local news and  nationwide talk shows (respectable ones).  This could look very bad for the military if they let him do this to her.  She needs some professional witnesses that will attest to her inability to function, doctors, counselors, psychologists and even someone with child services but the military should help with this.  If she comes across as capable then she will be getting nowhere in court.  Also you might be able to find a lawyer that would want the publicity but you have to present the case right to them.  Like this is an outrage of the military more than this guy being a jerk.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Have you talked to your local social services?  Their job is to handle issues such as these and to help where they can.  It may be best to go to the local office and see if you could talk to someone there.  They should have all sorts of information and ideas at their fingertips...Tough break - good luck!|`|AA10118707	This is indeed a complicated situation.  My first thought is to contact social services in your area and get your sister into some counseling at a community mental health agency.  That way, a counselor can see beyond the "normal" front your sister presents and then put her in touch with some of the community resources that may be available for her.  Documentation of her medical condition is super important as any agency offering her help will want to confirm exactly how disabled she is.  A referral by a counseling professional may help in securing at least some help.  Your sister's doctors should also be able to at least give your sister or caretaker family some idea of how your sister can manage with her condition.  I would think there are some rehabilitation programs that may offer her some time with an occupational therapist who can help her better take care of herself.  If she is behaving erratically and having mood swings, a trip to a psychiatrist would be in order (with all medical records with her.)  A psychiatrist would be able to determine if medication would help with her erratic behavior.  Best of luck and I hope this helps.
AA11603468	When we were seriously considering the idea, I called my siblings and mother to ask if they'd be willing to attend--they were my only "musts". If they said no, we probably would have gone another route, but my family was excited about the prospect-we travel together anyway, and we're a close bunch even though we live in 4 different states from Florida to Pennsylvania. We offered right up front to pay the airfare and hotel for those people. My husband's an only child, so it was only his parents-they also agreed despite not liking to travel. Everyone else who came was gravy. If we'd had a local wedding, it would have been for about 300, but having a destination wedding, we were only 33 total--which I GREATLY preferred. I always wanted a very small wedding, and never wanted anything to do with the ballroom/church extravaganza so many women covet.     We paid for our immediate families, but we still had about 18-20 people attend we did not pay for-they just used the wedding as an excuse to get away to the Virgin Islands in February!     Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't want anything else in the world. We did have a big party when we got back-that was a ball.|`|4POGapREaa	We got married in Hawaii but never expected anyone to make it there.  2 of our friends did come with us but only because they just happened to be planning that exact vacation already.  A friend of mine recently got married in Vegas & I couldn't afford to go.  15 months does give people time to plan, but just remember that saving their money & using their vacation time to go somewhere they may not have otherwise chosen, would not sit well with a lot of people.  I would do my best if it was either family or an extremely close friend but I wouldn't do it for an acquaintance or co-worker of someone that's not in my immediate everyday life.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i'm getting married in march in jamaica. we've always wanted a small wedding with just our immediate family. so having one was perfect for us, b/c the only people that were invited were those that wouldn't miss it for anything. it's also a good way to rule out those who would only come for the free alcohol.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	My husband and I got married in Hawaii, just the two of us. We didn't invite anyone but had a big party when we returned. I wouldn't do it any other way. It allowed me to focus on him and on our relationship and the commitment we were making instead of worrying about entertaining others.    I did attend a friend's wedding in another state a couple of years ago. He gave us almost a year's notice and he set up a group rate at a nice hotel that was convenient to the reception site and also was in a really fun part of the city. I knew I'd go to his wedding wherever it might be and the year's notice really helped. It also really helped that he had figured out the accommodations.
T2LSV53Waa	You sould talk to her and explain you did't have any bad intention.. She will understand.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	there is no accounting for stupidity so try to explain it and be glad that no one at the school saw it    Get rid of it or paint it orange|`|IczYnBelaa	Look before you leap next time. Admit to her you weren't thinking and you know you screwed up and you will be more cautious in the future. Not only will this show you are growing up, but it'll probably blow her mind. especially since you probably do a lot of stupid **** i'm guessin. i can talk because i did....
wMWfCjBpaa	Send out the invitations two months prior to the wedding date. They should RSVP at the latest two weeks before. Most venues require payment by then as well so that you know exactly how many guests you'll have.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I got married in September and we sent out my invitations in July.  The Rsvp was in August i think.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I am getting married 6th June and we are sending out invitations in March so that we can get the RSVP.s back by May for catering numbers.|`|f7l9byFGaa	It really all depends on what the date is that you need a head count for the reception.  I would say mail them out in the beginning of April, then have them RSVP by the beginning of May that way if anyone forgets to RSVP you will have plenty of time to contact them.  By having them rsvp in the beginning of May you also have plenty of time to do seating arrangements and do a full head count for the reception.  You don't want to be running around at the last minute.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	I think it's safe to send out the invitations 6 weeks before the wedding date.  For you, that's May 5th.    Have them RSVP at least 2 weeks before the wedding date.  For you, that's June 2nd.    Congratulations!|`|gK0vcdnDaa	I'm getting married the week before you :)  June 12th!      Congratulations!    I am just ordering my invitations and I'll probably send them out as soon as I get them.  I think that a lot hinges on if/how much travel is involved.  90% of my guests are traveling over 500 miles to attend so I'm trying to give them as much time as possible to plan.      I'm sending out Save-the-Dates in a week, I'm waiting for my engagement pics so that I can complete the e-mail/mail.  That will alert guests of the exact date and location, and I'm guessing that the invitations will be ready to go out mid-late March.     As for RSVP information, we are going to set the RSVP date as May 19th - approximately 3 weeks before the wedding so that we can make final arrangements for out-of-town guests and get the head-count to the caterer/ceremony venue.  We are offering a block of hotel rooms for out of towners, we have paid for the deposit, which we will be refunded when the guests pay for their room.      I have read that 6-8 weeks is plenty of time, but in our circumstance we are giving a little more.  I think its relative to what your acaccommodationsre.    Good Luck!  -Elle|`|A6MQuHfbaa	i would send them now, and have them RSVP within a month. then 2 weeks or so before the wedding give everybody who said they were coming a call to say how glad you are that they are coming to your wedding. they cant forget|`|KNGs5JfAaa	well my sister is gettin married in april of 2010 its sumtime from now but she will send them 3 months prior, she is also looking to order "save the date reminders" its magnets that has the wedding date & all the info they need to remember its really cute they will have their picture on it, and since they are magnets they can stick em on their fridge & everyone goes to the Fridge! =) u should really RSVP maybe  2 months before just in case for last minute changes u have enough time & wont stress it too much !!|`|TM9N4FKXaa	Im getting married July 11th and Im sending mines out in April, so I would think to send yours out either the 1st of 2nd week of March.|`|rZXQvA75aa	I would send your invites out on April 19th (that gives them 2 months notice) and ask for them to be returned to you no later then 2 weeks prior to the wedding, so RSVP by June 5th.|`|giocJLVKaa	Congratulations!  I am getting married the same day. :)  I plan on sending invitations out at the end of April.  I think that 6-8 weeks is sufficient.  I have always received invitations to others weddings within that time frame.  RSVP's should be done at least 2 weeks in advance.  (I'm asking for a 3 week notice.)|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Wow lots of june weddings! I am getting married June 12, 2009 and I am planning on sending my invites out the end of March or early April. I am doing the food myself so we don't have to worry about catering and all that. But if you are working with a caterer then I would ask them when they need to know by. Congrats and good luck!

I assume it has more to do with your own insecurities than anything else.  If your mate knows what those are (which they do or they will) they can either use them against you to drive you away or use them to make it easier on you (if they care at all).  But as for once they are out there. I guess you have to convince yourself YOU dont care.|`|UGG0yi4aaa	Just keep on smiling and ignore what they are saying.|`|BkOgWbg6aa	all depends on the situation when it comes to a man I dont simply because if he wasnt doing whatever it is hes doing i would have no cause to get jealous

It seems you don't have much of a problem meeting people and if you have friends go out with them even if she's around. You don't even have to bring up the fact that something is wrong because the way I see it, she is more of a liability then anything else. I do think you should subtley distance yourself from her because if and when she breaks up with her B/F she will probably want to spend more time with you. SO, make it clear enough now without saying it - that you don't have any time for her anymore. Trust me, you are better off without her!    GOOD LUCK!|`|owLbZfZraa	I think that she is just probably jealous of you I wouldnt even waste my time with a person like that...|`|0Q0iLRtlaa	You know its funny I have a friend almost exactly like this :P  I've known her for 8 years now and we've been bestfriends but in my case she doesn't give me freedom to have other friends, she sabotages many things, she openly insults things I do, and I feel like she takes advantage. You know, for a long time I thought I'm going to talk to her but not friendly...I thought I'm going to seriously lay it out and show her what the hell I can do, but my mom told me something that made me stop and think again--she said "shes your best friend. In bad times or good times or in any situation. You can't just say you're going to lay it out on her and then forget you were ever friends. It doesnt work that way. Your history won't allow it.." So I realized maybe shes right. I thought maybe I can try and overlook all those things she does and even ignore it. My last resort would be calmly speaking to her about it. I think your first resort is try to overlook it...I know its hard believe me but the history...I mean its almost your whole life with her...Its like erasing your past if you erase her. So I suggest you try your hardest to fight for your friendship even if she isnt doing much for it. If it becomes hell and even worse, then a talk wouldnt kill even if its hard too. Even my friend is not a "talk" to person so..I really hope this helped.  Best of Luck!!  -Mia|`|T2ztOxa9aa	nope..dont even waste ur time thinking it again..ive been there...move on...life is short
kHeXKtKraa	You are in a difficult position indeed.  First of all, identifying the possibilities is the best position for you to take right now.  You are in a postion to help her and she is willing to make her situation different in the hope that it will be better.  She has to acknowlege with you up front and IN WORDS that her behaviors have been difficult for you your whole life.  While you don't blame her and you do forgive her, that does not make her behavior acceptable.  The impact on your life already cannot be changed.  But you must tell her now, before you go any further in your discussions with her, that if she decides to make another attempt on her life while in your home, you will not forgive the impact it will have on your children.  You will be affected by an attempt, regardless of where she lives, but you must tell her now that you will not forgive her for what she will do to your family if she does this in your household.  She cannot expect sympathy for doing something she knows is unacceptable.  Allow her to move in with you under the requirement that she remain in therapy and you must also be in family therapy with her.  In therapy, she will learn to use words to tell you she needs help. Suicidal ideation is a tough thing to deal with in your home.  It is impossible to deal with it if you do not talk about it.  The feelings that the family has are important to deal with now, not later.  Depending on the age of your children, they must be able to access therapy too.|`|hneetSf2aa	wow that's a tough question to answer..all i can tell you is do whats in your heart..im sure you will make the right decision|`|9Q1muFGXaa	I would let her move in under guidelines. Strict ones. Like starting with counseling. She must go and attend and take her meds that she should be on if isn't yet. Tell her 3 strikes she's out. You need to give her a wake up call. That should help. It would probably make her happier being around the grand-kids to. They may brighten her day a bit more. I would do it but like i said be strict with the guidelines and stick to your guns on it.|`|A8kFFduNaa	She's your flesh and blood, so look after her in her time of need.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	Do you know why she is miserable?  Can you offer solution?    Your mother is an adult.  When she sets her mind to something, either be miserable and threaten suicide or actually commit one, there is nothing you can do to change her mind or change her behavior.    If you allow her to move in with you and she maintain her current course, she will just drag you and your family down.  In the end, she will remain miserable and suicidal.    It is easy to say "it's your mother..." but you have already said, you have been affected by her behavior all your life, and you are afraid of being dragged down or affected further.  This is a real concern.    Find out what the source of her misery first.  Step in ONLY if you can offer solutions and she is willing to change her ways.  Otherwise, you need to think of your, and your family first.    Remember - she is an adult with all the rights to change her own life.      I was thinking about this a while and it has occurred to me.  You said she has always been suicidal.  That means she always talked about taking her life, or she may have made some attempts.  The important thing is, she is still alive.  It is entirely possible that she became so accustomed to feeling this way that this may become her mode of everyday thinking and quite possibly, she has learned, she can manipulate people around her by acting this way.  Certainly, if someone was serious enough about taking her own life, it is not that difficult to do it in a way to make sure the job was done.  Please think about this....|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Okay im not gonna answer this for you because it is a major problem to deal with. But i can say if this happened to me i wouldn't let my mom live with me because if i was doing good this kind of stuff will just bring my family down and i wouldn't want that to happen. Im sorry but i wouldn't be able to bring her home. I love her very much because its my mother but i will bring her to where i live and put her in a facility that she can live in for awhile to get help. I will go and visit all the time and after she has gotten better i would bring her home. That's what i would do. Good luck i know this is a hard situation to deal with because its family but you have to do what you have to do.|`|hN2j60pgaa	no, do you really want a suicidal woman living with you?|`|X9cGsOq8aa	she should move in with u!|`|mcywqcHuaa	yeah, have her move in with you. it'll be easier to discover the body|`|kXFc00D9aa	Are you out of your freagin' mind?!  She should be in a safe place (NOT your house) getting professional help. God forbid she moves in with you and attempts to commit suicide in front of your kids...don't put your children through all of that simply because she did it to you for the past however many years.|`|rySAdA3Haa	That is a hard question to answer with out knowing the people involved but i think that you should think about what is making your mum feel like that dos she live alone suicide is often a cry for help i hope that this will be of some help|`|0AjyzHUHaa	Would you want a depressed women who is suicidal to be around your children.  You have to think about them in this situation.  It sounds as if your mother needs to go to some type of physicality to help her with her issues.  NOT into your home, with your children who DESERVE a sane, happy home, not one with their grandmother who is depressed and could pass that on to them.  Again, THINK ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN, and speak with your siblings about putting her somewhere that can help her with her issues and not putting the pressure on you or them.  Just remember to visit her (by yourself, leave the children at home until there have been changes), have the kids make her cards and send pictures...that should help a little so that she knows they still love her.  But your mom sounds like she needs more help that you could give her and she can work that out with a real therapist.|`|iVq1byuwaa	No matter what, she is still you mother, and you should support her when she is having difficult times.   Good luck   Love and support from Rio Dejunero,  Kati Rionadanio
sc6VBAmzaa	The thing is, if she's clingy, then she will not want to leave you. You will have to do the breaking and either way it will still be hurtful. More pain on her side than yours. I think you need to sit her down and explain to her in a calm and caring manner how much she means to you and all of the positive things she offers, but then slowly transition to her faults, but don't name them all and get irritated when you explain them to her. Just tell her how you feel and what you want from life and that it doesn't involve her. Try and stay calm and caring through all of this because she is going to be hurt badly by being so sensitive and clingy. I wish you the best of luck! My bf used to be so clingy and sensitive until I sat him down to explain all of this. Now he realized that being clingy is unhealthy and we are both happier now.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Just be yourself...an a*hole!|`|4a14dfd051c9e1157b10bc5abd40a5faaa	Try acting like an adult male.

Being a pansy about it just makes it worse for both of you.|`|707gOCvbaa	Be honest or tell her you found someone else? Either way she's not gonna like it but if you want out then it's your final decision. Last resort would be to just stop seeing her, do not call or visit and ignore her calls.|`|nAK82h6vaa	Just tell her it's not working out,and need to be alone for awhile|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Be firm tell her you are sorry and walk away.

Sit her down, tell her it isn't working, and break all ties if you don't want to continue a friendship after the romantic relationship ends. If she starts stalking, then you can get a court order against her for being psychotic.  Trying to 'spare' her feelings is only going to hurt them worse and you sending the mixed signals will just confuse her and make her cling harder.    Anyways, clingy, sensitive girls hardly ever break up with someone. They are called clingy for a reason.|`|p1jrHQMvaa	Tell her that you want to end the relationship. Then don't answer her phone calls, texts, emails, IMs, etc. If she goes all Fatal Attraction on you - get a restraining order.    Use common sense here. Why are you letting her control you?    If you have anymore questions, I started GuysCryToo.com - Relationship Advice for Dudes, and girls. There are a lot of others in similar predicaments as yourself and I feel you could get some good advice there as well. I typically don't give advice, but I like providing my own opinion at times.    Good luck!|`|Azp6bBazaa	you tried??  obviously not good enough.   man up.  tell her goodbye.  dont answer her phone calls or even tak to her. shell get the point.     and if you want her to break up with you. cheat on her.   or tell her youre gay.|`|436nLu91aa	Tell her you think you might be gay lol|`|U2nVrGm1aa	just make up some reason that you cant be with her - base it on something that is real though, itll make it easier to lie. dont tell her the truth though, let her down easy you'll have to be determined though, my m8 went out ith a clingy girl once.... it took him like, 3 hours to do it lol !|`|AA11919937	meh, get into an arguement.  then say "look. i'm done. i tried explaining to you yesterday but you wouldn't accept it. i'm sorry. it's over."|`|AA11570274	just tell her its not working it will look better for you if you dont get dumped by a clingy girlfriend but if you really want her to break up with you then just be really flirty with other girls and ignore her etc but that is mean so i suggest just break it off quickly and quietly and your free! or alternatively take everyone else's advice and tell her your gay...maybe get a friend to help with this! good luck.

Just think of this and it will make everything seem "new"  One of you could be gone in a WEEK or TOMORROW ...maybe even TODAY and your last words to each other may not be what you want them to be. Every time you say "I love you" think of it as your last "I love you" that's all you need in a relationship. You don't need cuddly ideas and cute pet names, all you need is true LOVE.
fHfVRcqbaa	I would check into getting married in Denmark.  There is no waiting period and they have weekend getaways up there.  You can check in the Herald Post and they have package deals.  Good Luck!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Call the german courthouse and ask them what you need to obtain a valid marriage liscense so that you can be married on whatever date you choose.|`|0bf8b29ed2b052955105afb4f7e2894aaa	CONGRATS!!!!! I would go to the court house and ask for full info because some states/countries require a complete physical for both partners including blood work. Also, you will want to know if there is a waiting period etc... Germany is a beautiful country and you will both enjoy the scenery involved. Have you checked out areas as far as picture taking etc...? You want this to be complete and memorable as well. The best of life to you both.|`|kbz5S3waaa	I'm not really sure, but I wanted to say Good Luck. :)  AF DEP - married to AF AD|`|qB4KvbDiaa	seems like you r on the right track
uBssj3Znaa	because they crave attention whether its positive or negative.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	wants attention|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	because they want attention from their parents.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	They are just looking for attention.Attention they are not getting from their parents.  Even bad attention is attention.  It is a cry for help.
IXskJPlVaa	Sorry dear you have to go thru all this. There must be something which has pushed her over the edge - if you can zero in on it - discuss it over with her and may be she has a change of heart. Else convince her for going in for couple counselling - for the sake of all the good times.That can really help or probably the best choice you have. For other lady for the time being - till all options to revive the lost love are exhausted. Best of luck.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	As impossible as it seems now, her leaving is not the end of something but the beginning of a better life for you and your kids, honestly, there is no excuse for that, whatever her reasons are, and for your sake and your kids, get out and meet people, not just looking for dates, but go out and be with people and network a bit, join a club, volunteer somewhere onn a regular basis, you need to keep busy and feel good about yourself until you can get back on your emotional feet. This may very well be the best thing that could have happened for you, just write in a personal journal and get your feelings off your chest, get out and meet new people do new things, and keep busy. Believe it or not, you can get past this in time and be happy again.|`|iD4ejChZaa	she left looking for love, she had been unhappy for a long time, you just din't see it. from 17-37 she thought is this all there is to life?    she isn't needed as 'mommy'' any longer, and is searching for herself. so you cooked, do you think that excites a 37 y.o. woman? if she finds a different man you may see he is the opposite of you, perhaps younger, romantic or fun. it's not right but i am stating possibilities.  i really hope she finds Jesus and returns, but if you are already thinking about other women, as you suggested--then you were not the devoted man she needed. my husband of 24 yrs. will not come back to stay, i am crushed, devestated,  i cannot even think about another man. it's only been 6 weeks look at yourself man, you're already thinking of other women.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Go find a rebound woman. Your wife sounds selfish.|`|03llfXdpaa	You were both very young when you got together. Maybe she just feels like she didn't experience single life enough. That doesn't make her a bad person. Just not the right person for you. It is hard to start over but you just need to take it one day at a time and think positive. You will meet someone else eventually but for now just focus on your kids and yourself.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	This is going to take sometime. You cannot erase 20 years over night. Your entire life as you knew it is changed. There is really nothing that you can do except move forward with your life. Perhaps enter into counseling and discuss you feelings. This can offer assistance with the healing process. And do not blame yourself she is a grown woman who is obviously not very mature if you had no clue she was not discussing her feelings openly. Good luck.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Steve I am sorry for your situation. So many people just do not feel obligated to their vows or children.     Try to be strong. It sounds like her mind is made up. Do your best for your kids. You will be ok, it just takes time.     Good Luck.|`|AA11692548	I am sorry to hear that you are going through such pain.  Yes you both did get married young and often with very young couples, feelings do change early on simply because people in their 20's are still evolving themselves.  Give it time and be there for your kids.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The biggest thing here is you have two kids that need you more than ever right now so you have a duty to carry on no matter what else happens. Sometimes people just feel overwhelmed with their lives with no where to turn for help so they feel that they can "escape" their present life by running from it. Chances are great that she will never find true happiness out here and sooner or later the guilt is start to set in on abandoning you guys. Now whether or not this guilt is strong enough to bring her back home is to be seen.She will soon realize its not having what you want, but wanting what you have. The happiest people dont necessarily have the best of everything, the just make the best of everything they have. Hopefully shes using this time out to get her priorities back in check and get a new grip on her life and return. I imagine with todays society the way it is that theres going to be alot of people running out of their current lives in search of new and better ones until they find out the grass is never greener on the other side. I pray that she returns soon for all of you but put your kids first now and the rest will take care of itself. Also,now would be a good time to do some soul searching of your own.Good luck|`|AqLwmafOaa	You have no idea how common your story is or how many other men have lived this one themselves. No another woman is not the answer. Focus on your children... they only have one parent now.... and they will be needing your help. As to moving on, keep your mind busy... jam it with anything handy to keep it  busy so it wont gnaw at you. You may need to write down on paper a list of EVERYTHING that must be done... date each bill is due, each appointment or obligation and then execute it as a check list to be sure you remain functional. It will may take a few years for all the healing to occur that's gonna happen so be patient. This will not go away overnight. Actually, it is never going to fully leave you. This will be a part of you always so adjust... it's about learning to get on with it not over it because you won't ever be the person your were before this experience.|`|0bf8b29ed2b052955105afb4f7e2894aaa	Steve,         This has to be really hard to deal with as I can imagine! Not only for you because of the time your lives have been spent together but because of your children. No, I wouldn't go out to replace that void right now but what I would do is to take some of this time personally to "re-group". Stay strong for the kids, go to church, get involved with community events or just be supportive of the kids if they belong to any type of club/school/or events. I wouldn't try to fill in the gaps too much regarding your wife. Let her do her own talking to them. After all, she is the one who left. She will have to answer to them and that helps in keeping you out of her area. Be listening for the times that the kids decide to talk and make sure your words are seasoned. If you are involved with church, go to the priest/pastor/father and have a quiet conversation about where you should go from here. Trust me they are well equipped with peoples problems from long before you.
8XKmMBU7aa	eat, drink and be marry, far tomorrow we die.  Life is only to enjoy.  What will you find after thinking on this one bore topic.  Don't care, don't think.    have a nice day and nice dream.|`|0Id85yiYaa	companionship, security, love, children|`|OltyaEbhaa	It is a sign of respect for each other as well as for any children to come.  You are right love, children can all be had without marriage, but not respect.  Do you have enough respect for yourself to demand more?  A ceremony between (God if  you believe) your family and friends?  A stand taken between the two of you with a legal paper, it says much more than the two of you are committed to each other, it is a legal document, binding, it shows the two of you respect each other and wanted to do what is right in the eyes of your family, friends, society and your children to come.     Children deserve to be in a home where the parents are married.  In schools (I taught in the school system for 15 years) there less confusion from a child in a  married home, the child usually has more self esteem, more sure of himself.  Their peers ask over and over about their family situation.  Also, what about the example for the child?  They deserve stability.  If this was not a big deal to someone, they would get married, and not ask the question.  This leads me to believe it may be easy for one or both of the parties to walk away from the relationship and don't believe what you hear about children being resilient, they are not resilent about losing one parent and having to choose a parent, they are simply dealing with a situation the parents cannot.  A legal document is much harder to get out of than moving in together, this gives the couple time to consider, to work things out. In any relationship things get tough, it is easier to walk away when you have less to walk away from.  I once asked someone who stayed  and worked out their problems in their marriage why they did so.  They said they could have left but it would have ruined their children, they did not want them to choose.  But also, they thought if they ended up in another relationship, the relationship most likely would have ended up in the same place, so why not work this out in the current relationship.  They are extreemly happy now, and are so very glad they worked things out.     Yes marriage has its ups and downs, you are going through life with the one you love.  It is a marvelous ride, one I can take and trust with my husband by my side, I trust those vows he took in front of God, his family, friends.  He is a man of honour, he does not want to let  God, me, his children, family or society down, nor do I.  I would not want to be with someone who did not want to marry me, who did respect me enough to marry me, or  give me his family name.      Marriage is a wonderful union between man and wife.  It works so beautifully when you both live to make the other happy, that is love indeed.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	It does matter if one of you dies without a will. With a marriage certificate, the survivor gets everything. Without it, nothing. If one unmarried partner dies, the survivor might not even get to go to the funeral, as it would be within the dead person's family's rights to arrange the funeral as they please, and to claim the property as the next-of-kin.  Common law marriage DOES NOT EXIST - though lots of people think it does. They are wrong.|`|mbenirEQaa	IThink marriage is a big gamble. Whats going to happen after marriage no one knows about? Even if you have been together for 3 years it doesn't matter after marriage relationship changes dramatically.   Why this happening becuase is everyone is been selfish, don't want care for anyone. Every individual only want to live for himself. I believe true marriage is when both husband and wife are living for each other and the kids.|`|QIwhMrBraa	because its the ultimate committment to someone, least officially. u can justify just 'living together' for 20 years as just the same committment, but really, i think we know it isnt.    if you have to ask ur looking for an excuse. and thats ok, if thats wot u want, its your life. me, i guess i was optimistic that both of my ex's would last forever, but at least my heart were in the right place by having at least gone into it believing it would last forever, rather than being skeptical and thinking well if it dont work out at least we didnt get married. cop out.|`|AA10990456	there are none - it's an outdated concept which serves only to put money in the pockets of the church and the divorce lawyers.    a commitment to another is based in the heart, not on a sheet of paper|`|2bfd67c8fecd2669e6fd5ad71bae6febaa	I believe it is a sign of your love for each other, a chance to share your love and joy with everyone you love (as in family and friends) It is commitment, respect for each other. It is a memorable day that starts off your life together in the best possible way. It cements your life together for good. Not everyone takes it as seriously as they should, but that does not mean you should see it as something not worth doing. You should not judge marriage on the people that mess it up and do not take it seriously, you should do it because you want to, because you love the person you are with and want to make a commitment to them. Getting married was the best thing I have ever done and it has made a difference to our lives, we are more cemented as a couple. It is really hard to explain the fantastic feeling you wake up with every morning knowing that your best friend, soulmate, is right by your side no matter what. Not everyone takes marriage vows as seriously as they should but some of us do. Do not try and form your feelings and opinions on how messed up some people are when it comes to not taking their vows seriously. What matters is how you feel about that person and if you want to get married, then do it. As long as you know how serious you are about the person you love, then that is all that matters. xxx|`|7fL2ZIruaa	For us it was because we couldn't afford to live together otherwise as he is in the forces so we can rent married quarters for a lot cheaper than private.

hLWy1evQaa	As a girl in the same situation, I have to say...NO!     I too get along with guys better than girls. From their humor and their laid-back-ness and the minimal drama, I just like being around men.     I get fed up with girls sometimes because they often get catty, petty for reasons unknown, and start stupid fight. Not all girls are like that; like you said, you have a close group of girl friends who get you, and those are the keepers.     But there is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with enjoying the friendship of the opposite sex more because you are comfortable with them. Having two older brothers enables you to see a guy perspective more than say, a girl who only has sisters or is an only child.     Don't worry...you're normal. And even if you weren't, what is normal anyway? :-)|`|8LBIeeomaa	nothing wrong...most of my friends are guys..girls act funny at times...|`|X9cGsOq8aa	UMMM..NO! OF COURSE YOUR GOING TO GET ALONG WIT OTHER GUYS BETTER, BC GIRLS ARE BITCHES....sometimes|`|RB7RjINwaa	It's not wrong. It's just that your two brothers have influenced you to get along better with boys, don't worry about it. Boys like it.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	No it's not wrong. Im the same way but mine is because I have had to many women back stab me before.|`|PdIRHRZgaa	no because gurls are very catty.|`|wS4ilryWaa	I'm exactly the same. My friends group of girls is about 4 whilst my guy friends are about 20, I think this is due to the fact that certain girls have the same humour and laid-back personality as guys.    For instance, a lot of girls bore me since they talk about shopping (my least favourite thing) and I just want to talk about computers and things, I find it easier to be around guys. They don't judge you if you don't straighten your hair.|`|5X6DVpRcaa	nope' this doesn't mean anything to be honest i am a guy and i get along with some girls better then guys and i don't feel different    althought i do get along with some boys better then girl's maybe you just need to find some girl's that you have thing's in common with|`|uBssj3Znaa	most women get along better with men than other women ... i know I do
va4dh98baa	If you really want to go out with him then just be honest with him and tell him that you like him and think that you guys should go out sometime.  Make it seem really casual at first if that will help you in actually being able to do it.  Plus don't worry you are only 12 so even if it doesn't work out right the first time there is still a chance.|`|nbf209Hqaa	What???|`|83MWb6kgaa	THIS IS THE LAMEST THING I DID BUT IT WORKED.

Girls hold all the power in the world.      Girls mature faster than guys, so unfortunately, you will have to wait until he is much older for him to understand anything.  So, be a kid, yourself.     When the guys are older then you, they also know how to manipulate you.     Yes, we will always try.  Better learn that now.  we are pigs. "I'm not joking."

w0ZqjJBtaa	Could it be that you are a perfectionist? Meaning...you hate to fail and rather running the risk at not being the best or getting it right; you bail out. That way, it is not set in stone that you failed. In a way, you doing it first means you will never have to know the outcome.|`|EAxjVxTEaa	your afraid of failure. Most people are. You have to look at it as a learning experience. If you never fail then you will never learn from your mistakes. Sticking with something can be good for you in order to make you better.|`|AA10118707	You have to find something that is truly enjoyable to you, doesn't bore you and gives you a sense of satisfaction.  Otherwise, you start and then quickly become bored when it becomes more challenging and never return.  Another way of thinking about it might help: once you feel the boredom set-in, vow that you will stick it out until at least one project is done, then make a judgment on whether it's for you or not.  If you're a student, then talk to your teacher or school counselor or academic advisor. They may offer some ideas too.  Good luck.|`|QIwhMrBraa	u are never gonna make it in life if u keep quitting. my guess is you had an unstable upbringing and maybe less than stellar parenting from your mum and dad. did they not have faith in you? was your self esteem crushed at a young age? are you depressed?    all these things can make you a quitter. u got to believe in yourself. even if you think u cant do something ,TRY. u will amaze yourself what you can actually do if you try.    f**k i repaired my vacuum cleaner yesterday and i know nothing about machines. i just took my time, thought about it, had a few tantrums and f*ck ups ,but after an hour managed to fix it, and it felt bl**dy great.    if i can fix a vacuum, you can do graphics. it just takes patience and stop being scared to f**k up. everyone does. some just handle it better.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Because you're not tough minded|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	This is were mind over matter makes a difference ,Start today saying to yourself I will never quit something just because it intimidates me.

bO2rzfISaa	Yes, I think he's calling her. I don't know how you're going to stop it, though. You have a trust issue with him because he's not trustworthy.     I think it's irrelevant that they don't want to know you. Your feelings are hurt about it, but it really is their prerogative.    Also, I don't think he really moved on. He still has a big emotional investment in her.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	It honestly sounds like they are carrying on an emotional  affair.    Their children are grown and the only topic that could be  keeping the chatter going for this long has to be them.    There is no doubt that they could be friends, some people  can reach that level.    The thing that makes me think it is more is the fact that   she never moved on.    You need to tell him that you suspect that even though he   is not having a physical affair, he is having an emotional  affair.    Ask him if he has intentions of leaving the marriage.    Best wishes|`|mbvpWNMeaa	If he has had so little contact with his children over the years that they did not even know he had remarried until ten years after the fact, then maybe he is talking to them at lot because he is working on repairing those relationships while he still can.  Why would you want to get in the way of that?  I would be ashamed of a man who waited that long to have a significant relationship with his children, but seeing that he is willing to work on those relationships now should restore some of your pride and faith in him, not the other way round.    Also, no woman wants to get back together with a man who abandoned her with two tiny children for almost 20 year.
pSiwm8rmaa	The daughter of a friend of mine used to see something in the corner of her bedroom too. I don't know what to make of it, but your story sounds very similar to his. Interesting...|`|9Q1muFGXaa	I would say it very well could be. Things happen in this world that can't be explained. I would somehow look into it. It couldn't hurt. Just try not to let your son see you worried about it though, he will sense how its making you feel. Maybe have a video camera at night in his room and watch to see if anything happens or see how he sleeps. Maybe he is just having bad dreams since its only occurring at night. take him to a counselor or something that can help him get over his dreams. I know he is only 2 but there is somebody out there to help him im sure. He could go to the hospitable where they Monitor patience sleep to see what kind of activities are going on mentally or if they do things physically while sleeping, like some sleep walk. That's what i would do take him to the doctors and find out whats going on and be patient to. If this continues and becomes to hard for him to deal with, it may only make it worse on him and the whole family. Good luck.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Your son might have a gift to see demonic spirits that you can't   it sound like someone might have died in your house and that someone or something is haunting your son,I would say get your house blessed by a priest,this sounds like it could get much worse if you don't do something about it,your son might have SIXTH SENSE,      When children say they see spirits, they do. To deny that they do is to guarantee the child will suffer from insecurities and self-doubt. Its much better to acknowledge to the child that spirits are often seen by children. Ask if the spirit(s) is an adult or a child, a male or female. Then add, if you want: "Many people, like myself, have been taught how not to see spirits." Or: "Many people, like myself, have forgotten how to see spirits." If you want your child to continue being able to see spirits, say this instead: "Its great you can see spirits. Of course, you have to tell them to obey your personal rules and house rules, just like people who arent spirits do." When A Child Sees Frightening Spirits Say: "This (man, woman, child) you see does not belong here even if (he/she) thinks otherwise. Maybe he/she is frightened and doesnt know any place better to go. Or maybe he/she likes to frighten children. Either way, Im going to send this one on his/her way by pointing out where he/she can go to get what he/she wants and needs." You can offer your child to help you do this, or to sit with you while you do it, or you can tell your child you will take care of it and explain how you did it when he/she (your child) is older.     TO SEND FRIGHTENING SPIRITS ON THEIR WAY SEE: SPIRIT ATTACHMENTS    When A Child Has "Invisible" Friends: Explain to your child why his/her friend is invisible to you. Explain his/her friend must obey your rules, just like your child does, or his/her friend cannot come to visit. Ask your child if his/her friend has a home or if the friend lives at your home. If the child says the friend has a home, ask if the friend feels happy and safe in the home. If the friend is not happy and safe at home or does not have a home say something like:    "Oh dear. We need to help your friend find a happy, safe home to live in where he/she has a safe, cozy room all of his/her own, with a loving family and a pet to protect him/her if he/she needs and wants one. Your friend can still visit you to play."    THEN SAY: "Tell your friend to close his/her eyes and hold your hand. Now your friend must think: I want the happiest, safest, most fun home and family for me. Now we count 1-2-3 and poof! Your friend is there. Im sure he/she will tell you all about it when he/she comes to play again."     If your child wants to know how to visit the friend, say, "You can do it in your dreams, which is the best way to visit the soul world."     If your child wants to know how to find his/her way in the soul world, say: "You can have a pet all of your own in the dream world (or soul world if you prefer). Your soul pet (whatever the child chooses - a dog, cat, dragon, tiger, eagle, or a fairy or whatever your childs imagination "conjures") will protect you in the dream world and bring you safely back home."     Shadow ghosts appear as a shadow of sorts. They look a bit like Ecto-mist but are dark gray to black in color. There are actually three separate types and we list them all in classes below. In photographs, it's easy to confuse them with natural shadows, so be careful with your analysis. They are usually extremely sneaky and evasive. When they are spotted it's usually out of the corner of your eye or as they are darting through a wall. They can also be spotted as a reflection in shinny objects and mirrors. As for photography, They are one of the rarest ghost types to be captured on film. Birds and cats are especially sensitive to them.    Type A - Appear as a small dark misty cloud and are almost always under two feet in length, but can hover or float up to 8 feet high.     Type B - Appear as a huge glob of thick cloudy mass. They typically range from 2 to 8 feet in height.     Type C - Appear in human form and some may be seen wearing a hat. They typically appear up to 8 feet in height.      Locations spotted:  Most often spotted in homes. Have also been seen outdoors at a distance.     Speculations:  I guess the general consensus would be that they are ghosts in one of their forms. Some would say that they are demonic spirits or creatures, but that doesn't seem to be the case, at least in most cases..

Children all have over reactive imaginations and most of them hate trying to go to sleep on their own in their room especially if the lights are off. Give him a night light that he can have on in his room when he's trying to sleep. If he could see something then he would tell you, however, dont ask him if he can because children can sometimes make things up to say what you want to hear. He will grow out of this when he gets a little older.. i wouldnt worry :)|`|AA12204752	Yes, children are innocent, so they have that ability so see what we refuse to see. Pack your things and get out of there. Unless your child has acted out before in this manner, you have every reason to believe him.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	I say yes. Experts say young children can see these images because society has not taught them yet that the images they see are in their imagination. I believe this theory.    My 4 year old daughter used to freak out when we would drive by a huge cemetery in our area. She always claimed that she could see "ugly things" there.     I have never lived in a house with this sort of activity and am not an expert, but your son is trying to tell you he sees something disturbing. Whatever it might be. Can you change his room? it would not have to be a permanent change but something that could ease his mind for the next few years.|`|VEw6Z4Gcaa	Well I think children can see things that adults can't. My mom and sister tell me all the time how i used to see "things". I used to see as they put "angels" all the time.   So I think kids can see 'spirits' because their so innocent and not blinded by everything else. Maybe a family member is watching your son. Or maybe someone is trying to send you a sign that you guys should move out of the house. But i strongly believe that whatever is going on is connected to how he's acting.|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	No, I think you are just being superstitious. You're not going to like this answer, of course, because it means you have to deal with the real issue which is training him to sleep in his own room, and that's not easy. But really. A small child's perception of the world is very different - they don't integrate their senses and emotions the way we do, so staring at the corner could mean anything. He probably just associates a particular feeling with looking up in the corner because he looks up there when he's alone, or maybe he had a nightmare while sleeping with his eyes partway open and "saw" something scary up there (I have done that when my eyes have opened a little when sleeping - dreamed about things happening in my real surroundings that I was seeing). You might want to explain to him about dreams, and maybe put something happy up in the corner like a picture or a mobile. Music boxes have delicate metal parts that can be sensitive to temperature and humidity so it's not impossible for it to start playing at random.    If you like to think this way, the nature of demons and spirits is, they become actual when we believe in them, and only then. The minds of the living are the most powerful things in the universe. You can shut anything that "is" in his room down with your will, and you can enlist his too by teaching him not to freak out over nothing in his efforts to get to not sleep alone.|`|AA11731307	Sounds like you should be burning some sage and put salt around the peremiter of you home, don't forget window sills.  Yes children can see things that we don't.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	I strongly believe the purity of children does open up these things. I am a spiritual woman and when we moved into our house my son had the same issues. I had my home blessed and since then we have not had any more disturbing moments.     According to my son (5) his angel keeps him safe and plays with him.|`|IczYnBelaa	Yes, some children can be extra-sensitive and see the super-natural. I know... I was one of them......... And still to this day i can sense, and sometime see.. It's a gift and a curse...
HBKglChlaa	if you know everything about eachother, there must be something there. you should arrange to talk to him in a more private place and see how he reacts as in the hall might be a bit too public for either of you to reveal your true feelings. just keep things going for a while and step it up a bit each time. try touching his arm when you speak to him, to let him know your into him as he might be thinking the exact same thing.  hopefully this helps (:  good luck.x|`|8SDg4Xy9aa	Talk to him about it. I was in a similar situation and i finally got the guts to ask him about it and now we have been dating for 2 months this saturday =)|`|nbf209Hqaa	Do not stress about it. Go with the flow. He is just a guy do not act desparet (spelled it wrong but you know what I mean). Luv yourself and that will attract guys to you. They can smell out desparation. TRUST ME! Keep up the flurting.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA ME LI, only way to find out, if he likes you enough to date you, is to ask him out.|`|690MZg0Xaa	Hint about going out or sumit, see if he asks u out...I think he likes u|`|yj3i682Zaa	Yeah. Just go with the flow. Just go by the things he says..|`|ilbMPWmzaa	touch him back, get flirty,|`|QLMW7HRMaa	Even when you think, you do,  you don't.|`|VcIYeMcyaa	ok here is one awkward way of finding out exactly what you are looking for..  since the details you give are a bit cloudy.. such as "Touching me" i don't get that part.. but if you want to figure out if he wants to step it up to the next level or just remain friends.. you will have to ask yourself a few questions when talking with him.. and yes this has to be done real time.. i know it sounds crazy but i swear it works.. when talking to him look for anything that gives his intentions away.. where his eyes are looking when you talking where his hands are placed at that time.. when a guy is nervous he tends to either put his hands in his back pockets in his front pockets or just move them around a lot.. and when he likes you but can't cough it up because of lack of courage he will give you signals unintentionally such as.. he pays attention to what you are saying.. and he would also remember things you talked about awhile back.. so try asking about something far back.. and if he remembers this guy is actually trying to built a profile of you.. things that you like dislike and maybe ask you out when he is sure of himself. or simply just corner him and ask him straight.. are we just friends? because i have a feeling you are holding back on me. and gl  and btw i am a guy i've been in his place a decade ago ;) if his eyes look straight in to your eyes this guy likes you for more than just ***|`|EyElJfHyaa	you dont|`|BqXSymxjaa	Ask him.|`|DtEnHza6aa	you don't..    just go with the flow.. hit him back.. talk to him.. stuff..    or you could ask him to watch a movie with you..|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	Best thing to do is ask him out and see what he says! If you're talking as friends or flirting you could just say something jokingly like "So when you taking me out then?" and see what his reaction to this is... It's going to take guts but it's probably the only way you'll find out for sure.    Good luck!
EMKuBql8aa	Yes.     I haven't spoke to my parents in 2 years because they basically dis-owned my daughter (their grandchild) and my wife because of religious reasons.    EDIT: I should mention that she isn't some crazy religion, she is Jewish. And after they called my at the time 10 month old daughter a "Dirty Jew" I stopped it. I am NOT going to have my kids around vile, toxic people who doesn't love them for their personalities, but only cares about their image. What did a baby do to them?     The stuff that they did to my wife is too long to get into here. She put up with hell from them and never complained. She only said to me, "As long as they are good grandparents, I can keep my mouth shut." Well, that didn't happen.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	No my mom and are are very close and can talk about anything.|`|9Q1muFGXaa	Yep over drugs and money, lying and stealing. i have disowned 2 uncles and one of there girlfriends. And my younger brother. I haven't seen them in over 2 years and i could careless and hope they get what they all deserve. They treated my parents like crap when my mom let all of them stay with her rent free. They were doing drugs and stealing from my parents and would lie. So my parents ended up saying screw it and moved out of there house and let them junkies have it. Which sold everything in the house (windows, trim, doors, wiring, ect.) They all lived in it for 3 months after the utilities were shut off. A bunch of low llife'sand I am ashamed of how they have become into monsters.|`|AA12198711	Are you trying to gather stories from others to justify your actions toward a family member? Just curious.    I chose to close the door on my sister. She is manipulative, lies, cheats and puts down others in order to make herself feel better about her.     When I turned 50 for some odd reason I decided I did not have to subject myself to anything that was not right for me. She wasn't, never was.    This led to distance between me and my mother because for some odd reason my mother chose to protect my sister and make me out the bad one. Choosing? Never do that.|`|QINXWKPUaa	i swear now and days the perfect family doesn't seem to be so common. I only live with my dad and he is all i have, i do have a sister and a mother and uncles and all those other family members but i do not see or speak to any of them because well honestly they are f*cked up. i figure as long as you have at least one family member that cares then your set.|`|7foornMVaa	Yes, my mother.     I love her very much but I dont like the person she is.    She lies, steals, stalks, asks me to lie for her, asks me to stalk with her and much more.    I chose to keep her out of my life to spare me and my family from the drama that oozes from her veins.|`|DenLZAL1aa	No I didn't stop loving my son, but he chose to estrange himself from his complete biological family, at the behest of his new wife. His wife was demanding and manipulative. It has been ten years, and recently we found out my son had a son three years ago. He does not want us to know.
ZbxcHDh2aa	Its ure choice hunni choose the person who respects you just for you,who you think is realli intrested in u-who you have more chemistry with.who always makes u smile when u are by them,and makes ure heart pound.  they seem like they both love you..your caught up in a love triangle..sort it out.|`|CMDnwVuUaa	I personally think you should dump the boyfriend you have now. For the reason you two are fighting all the time thats not a healthy relationship.     try the new guy and see how it goes because you are being deceitful to your boyfriend by having another boyfriend.

Yeah, take it from me, weed can REALLY mess you up!!! i dont smoke so how do i know right? well my ex bf used to smoke weed. he turned out to be aggressive, and would always say things that didnt make any sense. he was insane so to speak not alright upstairs. he wasnt like that before. lets just say he hung around the wrong people. your smart now, but if you keep at it, by the time your 30 ...  youd be a half witt. only telling the truth, coz i also had friends and family that used to smoke it. to be honest, non of them turned out good in life. just a word of warning !!! but it might be different in your case, who knows hey? But good luck though :)|`|zGKmgwofaa	Forget it em, you are a pro.|`|k2PyXP4saa	its none of ur business what u do with ur time. as long as ur not a pot head. and do nothing with ur life ur good atleast u do somethin with ur life|`|cyht3kSvaa	there's nothing to do let them talk but smoking weed is bad its not doing nothing but killing you lungs alot of people who i know that smokes weed is trying to stop not cut down but stop|`|MaUPQ7mEaa	JUST STOP BEING A DUMBASS fred/DEMON  Just keep doing..you are a pro...i guess..|`|WGTRBYepaa	ignore them ~ folks who don't 'smoke' will never quite understand those who do....|`|47Et6CaHaa	everyone has their poison. some people get drunk, others get stoned. personally i do the latter, and everyone respects that cause i know what i'm on about. I can tell you EVERYTHING there is to know about buds, and cause of that people respect my decision to smoke it. I suggest you do some research, find out what you're doing to yourself and why its better than alcohol. I recommend www.thegooddrugsguide.com  or  www.thesite.org  ignore anything to do with the government, its seriosuly biased.|`|51ne4RkHaa	they should not care what you..|`|PfRctum7aa	Better a regular weed smoker than a regular alcoholic.    Scientific research has found that THC might cause brain cells to grow and it would be beneficial to treat many medical conditions such as depression and anxiety.     http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn81...    As to the the people that are opposed to your smoking maybe they have lost a few too many brain cells from all the booze they guzzle down and cannot see past the propaganda that has bombarded them for the last 80 or so years    the marijuana plant is one of the most benign and beneficial drug on the planet, it is impossible to overdose unlike aspirin or even cough medicine. weed cures glaucoma, headaches, back pain...etc etc   Big Pharma has a lot to loose from it's legalization as hemp    It has potential to be the answer to many of the worlds environmental problems. hemp cloth is absolutely without a doubt superior to cotton and does not require any chemical pesticides. (cotton industry is one of the worlds biggest pesticide users.) and is the reason our ancestors used hemp for everything from paper to ship sails, Christopher Columbus used hemp to sail the seas and found America.  bill of rights, American constitution all written on hemp paper.    industries that would collapse if weed was legal would be the following"  logging/ wood chipping industries  cotton industry  pharmaceutical industry  charities as weed seeds produce a high protein food source.    so my advise to you is get educated about weed and then you will have ammunition for those that think it's just bad because they were told so.    The truth shall set you free.    and remember everything in moderation|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	I don't smoke weed but some family members do.  It's illegal but shouldn't be.

Overtime the stuff will wear away your brain cells and you will not be so smart.  As for those who cant smoke like you? well actually they are the smart ones for they choose not to always be high on a drug but to be high on life.|`|8mr0Yy8Caa	Actually, you should change.

You seem to at least be aware that these kinds of behaviors are not normal, so you are one step ahead. As for why your parents treated you the way they did, you may never know.

db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	my fiance's best friend is only spending $50, but it depends on the wedding... some want tuxedos (I don't - just your best black suit) tux rentals are about 150... then there's the bachelor's party... I'd say 250 MAXIMUM and that's including the wedding gift if your funds are tight... or go in together with all the groomsmen|`|x2p2Ivz4aa	About $250..|`|F2ygsPEbaa	When my wife and I got married many years ago, we paid for all the tuxes of all the groomsmen.  Also, our bachelor party consisted of going out drinking at a bar...nothing really expensive or elaborate.    When somebody asks you to be his best man, there shouldn't be a financial obligation that comes along with it.  If his expectation is that there will be, feel free to say "no."  I would never go through a veiled attempt to get somebody to help me with wedding expenses through an invitation to do something that "really means" I want you to spend money on MY celebration.    Let's look at this for what it really is.  A heart-to-heart with your future brother in law and perhaps also your sister is in order.|`|k6Ki1QwXaa	This depends on a lot of factors, such as travel, hotels...    Basics:  Haircut: $20  Tux: $120 - $250  Bachelor Party: $200 - as much as you want... (everyone who attends should help pay)|`|ZXN5Thb4aa	Rent your tux, get something personal but inexpensive for the wedding gift (a framed picture of you and the happy couple at a party, trip, school, etc., for instance) and throw a close to home bachelor party and let the other male members of the wedding party help.  Unfortunately, that's just about the cheapest way you can go without looking cheap.  I think that most grooms-to-be just want and need your support and best wishes.|`|cIJ960Wbaa	you can find a tux for about a hundred bucks anywhere.|`|woOeYFrEaa	The bride and groom will likely pick the tuxedos and you'll have to rent where they pick.  It should run somewhere in the $100-150 range.  If that's too much you need to just be honest with them.  We paid for some of our wedding party's tuxedos because we knew it was a hardship for some of the guys.    As far as bachelor party, well, my husband's friends just took him to ride go-carts and play video games.  All the men in attendance chipped and paid for his share.  You just have to be the organizer.  Camping/fishing weekend, video games, shooting range...just think of an activity he would enjoy.  It doesn't have to be an expensive night of bars and strip clubs and his wife would probably be thrilled if you picked something tame.|`|eeyfLIeMaa	youre gonna spend better than 100 on tux rental alone|`|5sIPEujsaa	$100.|`|KkmEUe1qaa	it can really vary. the best man will need a tux, which will run about 120$ depending on your location. you also throw a bachelor party so you'll be responsible for your drinks and a share of the groom's drinks. mostly the cost can be shared with the other wedding party though. the best man doesn't have nearly as many costs as the maid of honor. be glad you aren't a girl!|`|ra69rxxgaa	It depends on the wedding..
auwG3d2yaa	Hey bro, I am sorry about your problems and I hope my answer can help you.    Talk to someone man, anyone. You need to let everything out bro. You probably have so many things inside you that you do not discuss with anyone. That's unhealthy and not letting your feelings out will make you even more depressed.    You should call someone you know and trust, and talk with them. Let your tears out man! Cry it all out!    Also take sometime to relax and think about things. Go outside and enjoy a beautiful day.    Remember of the people who love you, remember all the good things you have, be grateful for everything man. Be grateful for your internet, for your computer, for your freedom, for a place to call home, for food.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well you need to get out and go places with friends and family,read about Jesus or watch movies that will help get rid of the depression,  talk to other family members,take medication that will help with the depression,  If it is morning, get up. Take a shower. Get dressed. Eat a small breakfast. Do not turn on any sad music or depressing TV.   Step2Get out. Head to the nearest thrift store. Greet the person at the counter. Rummage through the store yourself, and try to strike up a conversation with any friendly customers. Look for an opportunity to help a large family by contributing a few dollars toward their purchase. You could accomplish this indirectly, if you wish, by arranging with the counter person to help with their purchase after you leave.   Step3Head out to a big discount store where you can buy bakery goods. Buy a few dozen chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies. Leave them in the original store package. Bring them to the reception desk at a nearby large retirement home and/or soup kitchen and tell the person in charge that you would like to donate them to the patrons there.   Step4Eat lunch out somewhere, be kind to your server, and pay attention to the activity of the people around you. Leave a more generous tip than you are accustomed to.   Step5Go home and look up the phone number, address or email of a friend that you haven't seen in some time. Write or try to contact them to see how they are doing.   Step6Go outside and take a brisk walk around you neighborhood, at a nearby park, or at a mall if it's raining. Be alert to the people and children around you, and be prepared to smile and exchange pleasantries with anyone that you are able to make eye contact with.   Step7By this time you will have experienced bursts of joy, which are very good medicine indeed! Write about your experiences in a journal, and begin to brainstorm future activities along the same lines. Meanwhile, each day get up, get dressed, eat breakfast, and look forward to your adventures that day, that will involve giving of yourself to other people.   Things Youll Need:  Shower   Clothes   Breakfast   Walking Shoes|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	many times it is not something you can deal with and you may need medical help so see your Dr and tell him or her what is going on in your life and how you feel|`|gK0W7cUFaa	go see a phsyciatrists..    they will help you get over your depression..    or if you have a doc. app. any time soon   tell them you feel depressed they can give you some  antidepressants..|`|AA10199189	first of all i don't think there's a person on the planet who has not thought about suicide at least once.    secondly, find yourself an honest, trustworthy person with whom you can talk about anything.  open up, do not leave out any details.  this could be a therapist, a counsellor, a priest, or a mentor -    good luck|`|N94zVTC2aa	I'll tell you now, from personal experience that any one can commit suicide even if they think that they are too cowardly to try it.  The only thing I can give you are suggestions, but I hope that you will try to follow them.  1. Tell a true-blue, I'll-be-there-for-you friend about how you are feeling and ask them not to judge.  2. This will likely be harder, but tell an Adult figure, with authority and that you look up to, such as a teacher, guidance counselor, etc. about your thoughts.  3. Talk to your doctor to make sure it's not clinical depression; and   4. Say one positive thing about yourself every time you tell yourself something negative.  Yes, I know there is a lot of talking involved, but that is just the first step to overcoming your depression. And remember the most important thing the people you tell about your depression, and I do not mean over the internet,  is to ask them not to judge you over your thoughts.
AW1dCzH0aa	It depends on where you live.  I would stay away from Kay and Zales jewelers as they have horribly priced diamonds that are terrible quality.  You may want to check out Shane Co. (they also have a website).  I live in San Francisco and I shopped at Derco, Simayof, Giraux and Tiffany locally.  Then I found this article about Costco diamonds vs. Tiffany and decided I did not need to have a Tiffany diamond!    http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Business/Story...    But, I still think bluenile.com is the best deal around!  They have great deals on diamonds, no sales tax (which can save you a bundle) and right now, they are having 10% off all their settings.  You should check them out, even if you don't buy there.|`|woOeYFrEaa	My fiance and I basically just hit the mall.  We went through the various shops and I got an idea of what I liked.  We ended up finding the setting at Jared's and my husband liked that because he could pick out the exact stone that he wanted placed in the ring where the standard mall stores (Zales, Kay's, Etc.) don't offer that service.    If you want to go really high end Bailey, Banks and Biddle has a great website but they're super pricey.|`|2T7r1Gmcaa	jareds!|`|0Id85yiYaa	kays!    http://www.kay.com/webapp/wcs/stores/ser...    it's where i got my ring and his band.|`|h7xh61TWaa	Kays, Zales, Marks & Morgan, etc... they all sell the same stuff.     Look for specials.     Tiffany's does have GREAT quality rings, but you also pay 200% more just for the name... You can't touch a 1ct Tiffany ring for under $8000.|`|aCcRsh7uaa	Here's a whole bunch, all of which have stores in most major malls all over the country.  You can use the store locators on the sites to find exact locations.      www.zales.com    www.kay.com    www.jared.com    www.helzberg.com    www.whitehalljewellers.com    www.baileybanksandbiddle.com    www.robbinsbros.com    www.jamesallen.com    I hope this helps!|`|HQsmRzPsaa	kay's|`|zaSyEcnqaa	Avoid the mall stores IMO.    Tiffany's has beautiful things and you can get a ring for $5000 but ti will be tiny. You pay for the name and the tradition.     We went to Jarad's and got impeccable service. They have a great selection and are a true jeweler. You will pick the diamond, the setting, the head.    Unlike a mall store where the rings are pre-made with diamonds of questionable quality. When you are making a big purchase like this, it pays to go to a reputable jeweler who can back up your purchase.     The Jarad's website is bad, you really have to go in person. They do not have engagement rings  on there since most you build yourself in the store. They, do, however have some preset rings.     Good luck.
DjLFiZEwaa	I really doesn't matter what you want or what your husband wants.Children need both parents around unless one parent is abusive.It will be best if the two of you can live close so the kids will have the advantage of both parents.It may come back to haunt you years from now if you take the kids  a long distance from their father.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I would never NEVER ever leave my children for any reason.

QIQNzE11aa	If your husband is on the birth certificate, it won't matter if she isn't biologically his or not. Even if you can prove, biologically, that the child isn't his, he still has to pay for child support. IF he is on the birth certificate. IF the birth certificate is left blank for a father's name. Then he can get out of child support payments IF she's not his biological daughter.     How horrific to suddenly hear this after 17 years. If the daughter knows, i think a DNA test would be in order. If the daughter doesn't know.. that's really difficult to say the least. But DNA can help you.|`|0Id85yiYaa	no. imagine how the daughter would feel. even if he's not her biological father, he's the only father figure she's had growing up. what's 1 more year of child support?|`|t81MEJ82aa	Yeah he should to put some closure on the issue. It doesn't sound like they are close, but to avoid future situations he should. Also, there might be a time where the girl needs medical attention so obviously it would be to her and everyone's benefit that she at least know your husband and his family are not blood relatives. Also, she'll probably have no claim to his estate upon his death. If he has doubts I don't understand why this is even a debate, regardless of the mindless people saying that this is a slap in the face to the daughter. The ultimate slap comes from her mother for lying all of these years. That argument makes no sense to not know the truth.     As far as my understanding, he'll probably still be obligated with his child support order. But if they come back that he isn't, he should still consult with a lawyer.|`|bO2rzfISaa	If she's reached 17 without this being an issue, I have the feeling that you are the one bringing it up. If that's so, you should stay out of it.|`|71yXXY3eaa	There is not enough tangible information to make a decisive judgment.  However, it sounds like no one is sure on who the daughter's father is.  If there is in actuality no firm belief in this, you should get a DNA test if it could resolve such an important issue not only to your husband but to the child's sense of identity.      However, if this is more a case where many people are simply trying to convince themselves of something that is not the truth, you should work to disabuse everyone of this behavior and show why the truth, although painful, should be accepted.|`|8FO52r0Maa	do it, seriously, that is no way to live your life, and for medical reasons it's a good idea to know.  God forbid should anything happen to the girl and she would need a transplant, or there could be genetic problems that she may not know about if your husband isn't her father that she needs to know about|`|iD4ejChZaa	of course how could he pay all these years on her word alone?|`|OBCvewW2aa	Seems to me, if your husband is worth his man card, the results of a dna test wouldn't make a lick of difference.      Those tests are pretty expensive.  And asking for one at this point in time is a slap in the face to his daughter (yes, daughter).|`|VmQBhY6iaa	HELL YEAH!!! for tomorrow is later!!!  I don't understand how he hasn't have it done yet,if the mother is such a ****!  P.S: she doesnt have to look like the father to be his...but a DNA test will solve ur problems! Good luck!!      Edit*****  if your the one bringing it up,not too good,but somebody has to open his eyes,right?...especially if she(the daughter) dont show her face unless is for money...|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Yes, if for no other reason than peace of mind.|`|AA11328507	I do not see the difference it will make now.  He should have done it when he found out he was a father.  The girl is 17 for goodness sakes.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	What interesting to me is that you say "the only time we here from her is when the child support is a day late."  Is this father not actively pursuing a relationship with this daughter that may or may not be his?  If he only looks at her as payment for a "mistake" he made with the mother than yeah get the DNA test so he can prove once and for all if she is his financial obligation for another year.    If he actually cares more about being father than an atm machine maybe he can man up for another year and be a father to her for the rest of her life?    EDIT: thank you for the additional info...pursue DNA testing and if he is not her child than he can stop being her atm machine.  She sounds very spoiled and selfish|`|ruczpWrGaa	yes because if the mom is openly saying this then the girl knows they may not be related.  it will help with some of the questions she already has.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	That is sad for the father For sure he can go right to the courts and demand a Dna test and he also needs to plan to have something in writing that child support stops since she don't want nothing  to do with him,Except for his money.You stick with it make the test happen so he will know and he can stop paying .|`|lyhnHhuWaa	He can ask for a DNA test but it probably won't make much of a difference other than to prove that the child is or isn't his.  Of course, if the child isn't his then it will prove the child has no claim to his estate upon his death.  But... at this point, if he has acknowledged himself as the child's father for the past 17 years the courts won't reverse anything relative to child support.  Even claims to his estate could be succesfully challenged if he's acknowledged himself as the child's father for so long.  Biology won't make a difference in court after that many years.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes. The girl should know if he mother was a floozy.|`|sPtELQ1Xaa	He needs to get one;  but he should wait until after the last year of child support.  Even though it might hurt the girl, its best to know the truth.  But the relationship shouldnt change.|`|e7dAJAA6aa	Either way he is still going to be a father to her. Why even put the both of them through that emotional stress.|`|MbViaCVoaa	He and his daughter have never been close and she doesnt even call him dad.. the family thinks she knows the truth but as long as the money is there she is going along with it|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	First of all this is his business and what  a loser if he gets the test  if he  was there for her then he is the dad period. And why is it step moms never know their place? Sounds like your just being greedy with the money. Its only one more year anyway.|`|DjLFiZEwaa	Is your husband a daddy to this girl? If he is a daddy  to this young lady it has NOTHING to do with if he is the bio father to her.If he isn't a daddy and only the male parent to her she will be 18 soon enough and that will end the child support. Don't go mess up this child's life by trying to prove she is or is not your husbands bio child.She will feel like he doesn't love her and doesn't want to be her father.She will feel like the man who has been my father for 17 years really isn't my father.This could lead to a lot of problems emotionally for this girl.Being a daddy is what is in your heart not DNA.|`|4C9U3Xh6aa	Yes. Even if the truth hurts. Its better to know. This child might one day need her real father, Health wise. No one should have to support a child unwillingly if they are not the real father.|`|YDjoAKROaa	If you want an answer for the sake of possibly eliminating child support, then yes.  if you are thinking about the girl involved, no.    imagine being 17 and having to submit to a DNA test because the man that you've known as "dad" your whole life now believes he is not your father.  If the results come back that he is, that girl will probably be anger, bitter, and resentful towards him and it will ruin any relationship they've worked to have.  if it winds up that he's not, she'll probably be heartbroken and have a ton of questions.     if your husband has known this girl as his daughter and cared for her emotionally throughout her life, then abandoning her is not the right thing to do.    Keep in mind that even if the child would be proven not to be his, then he would NOT get any money back that he has already paid.|`|qpS8Kbzxaa	sounds like a wonderful guy first he abandons his daughter now he wants to show his love by trying to disown her.|`|fb719885a6ad0c93baa1955ec6f7904caa	You need to keep your nose out of it|`|AA11692548	He can get a test but at this point she really is his daughter so to speak.  Will this test be done out of vengence? I am wondering how the girl is feeling right now.  I am very much concerned about how this is affecting her.  Even at 17, she will be horribly devastated finding out the truth ( if it turns out her father is not her father)|`|xGshAiXOaa	Yes, they both deserve to know the truth.  If the mother is telling 'everyone' that she doesn't know who the real father is, hasn't the daughter overheard something?  She could be curious about it as well.  Your husband needs to sit down with his daughter, and they need to discuss this.  He can start the conversation by bringing up the fact that he has recently heard that her mother may not be certain that he is her father, and they can decide together if they would rather know the truth and risk not getting the results they want, or if they would prefer to not know and continue as father and daughter.  Shame on his ex for putting them both into this situation, but sooner or later the truth would come out with so many people knowing of the mother's uncertainty.|`|yE2ebQGmaa	Get one of those identigenes from the drug store. 20$.

ba9d16f9a309b045361ff22238034b23aa	Sobriety is not a requirement for getting the license in fact they even allow for spelling corrections to your name after you are married.  I assume that is because they know some people will be too drunk to write their own name correctly.    Also, the downtown license office is open every day, holidays included, until midnight.  (During peak periods they staff extra employees.)    Additional - There is a civil marriage chapel at the downtown license office that is open until 10PM or you can visit any of the chapels that are within just a few blocks of the license office.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I'm guessing the laws are different there, or it's somehow easier to get the license.

In the U.S. you can get married at 18 without any consent.

2rsiKfj7aa	Hi! I live in Alabama and I have 2 kids with a sperm donor as well! Are you sure he did not live separate lives?  Anyway, my ex is on what is called a tax offset. Any monies that is received from taxes will go straight to the department of human resources and then to me. When you applied for support did you go through the human resource department? If you did, you could call them or if you have a web address for them check it out there. I can access mine through their web site and entering my social security number then it says tax offset information! Good luck with all of this! Mine just got out of jail for non payment and guess what he still isn't paying! Some just do not care!|`|htSZsds7aa	Alot of times you will get his refund check if the state knows he owes you.

I would not let him take my phone and check it, he's not my father and he's not even my boyfriend anymore, he has no reason to do that.  Oh, wait, yes he does.  He wants to feel like he's so super special that you can't get over him.  It may be an ego boost for him.  Again, don't go over to see him, don't talk to him, issue solved.    Go out with who you want to go out with.  His friend asks you out?  You want to go, you go.  He's going to get mad?  Really? Was you getting mad a concern when he was setting up new girlfriend while you were still dating?  No?    Here's the thing.  You need to be concerned about you and stop being concerned about him.  What he does is on him, what you do is on you.  You allow him to kiss you, hang all over you and by doing so you're keeping him in your life.  Let him go.  In fact, push him out.  He doesn't get to be the main focus anymore and that was his choice.    I promise you I wouldn't be limiting myself on the basis of what would make him happy or upset.    EDIT:  Oh honey, if he still thinks he's going to marry you that's incredible.  I would not believe this friend.    Honestly though, does it matter?  Do you want to marry someone who decides the thing to do when he's not sure what's going on is to break up and see other people?  Is that going to be the way he handles problems in the marriage?  (Yes, probably it is)    I repeat:  Don't talk to him.  Don't go see him.  Don't kiss him.  Don't let him touch you or hug you.  If he asks why you're not doing these things just tell him you're not his girlfriend.  If he's still interested he will see that his current little whatever isn't working and is losing you for him (and it should, really, I'd be a fond memory and nothing more).    I really wish you luck.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Why do women let themselves be played like this. You broke up and it's over. So, just move on and learn from this experience. Don't sit there and bemoan your existence just because some guy dumped you.  Besides, if after 2 weeks he is already dating someone, he was probably cheating on you.|`|AA11969451	You need to stay away from this guy. He is poisoning your spirit with his little games.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	He's playing you and you're letting him.  He's being sweet to you so you'll keep hanging on to hope.  As long as you're hanging on to the hope that he'll take you back he knows he'll have you waiting in the wings if his current fling doesn't work out.  If they break up, he'll be all over you until the next fling comes along and then he'll dump you again.  He's not worth the trouble.  Scoop up your courage and self-esteem and tell him to buzz off for good.  He's a loser and you deserve better.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. I will say this, anytime I've ever broken up with a girl, and then returned to the relationship (outside of the sex of course) I eventually remembered why I wanted it to be over... and left again.     I wouldn't suggest playing the back and forth game. You should just stay away completely (cold turkey), and if he comes around, then maybe all he needed was time to reflect, and if he doesn't, well, he's not meant for you.     NOTE: Most men will do just enough in this situation to have their cake and eat it to.|`|xV2Xjo4Iaa	leave run fast in the other direction|`|AA11692548	Sounds like he is playing with you.  As much as it hurts to not be with him, he is teetering on the fence with you and the other girl.  If you step back for a while and see if he is someone you want to be with, tell him he has to figure out what he wants now|`|WSkH6LaZaa	This guy is a cheater and is getting at you and her. He dosnt want to be tied down. All the treatment you gave him didn't matter cause he is a user. Move on you deserve better. What the other girl knows is none of your business. Let her find out what a lame person he is. Stop going over and seeing him. He isnt going to take you back. They never do. He is done using you and now he is just getting what he wants.|`|024910ffc7104c135d901f2da8f1011daa	Just say firmly  NO and do not let him to your place under no circumstances. It will be a bit tough for you to say that because you evidently still love him. But you have to bear in mind that he is just playing game with you and that game could be quite costly to you. If he is so frivolous with you he is likely with other girls as well. I would advise to stay away from him before it is too late. Remember about HIV or other VD. he may acquire by having sex with other girls.   VERY SCARY
xGshAiXOaa	Tell your mom that you're extremely disappointed, both in her unwillingness to forget the past for one day, and in holding resentment towards you for wanting both of your parents to attend your wedding.    My parents are divorced, but they never made me choose who to pick for important events.  They were both there for graduations, awards ceremonies, etc.    You can not make her go, and you wouldn't want her making a scene if she did.  Let her make her own choice and be haunted by regret for the rest of her life.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Oh man. That's really rough... I'm sorry for what you have been through. It seems as though everyone is moving on but her, and IMHO, if she wants to continue being angry, let her. If she refuses to attend your wedding, be the bigger person and let it be. She will come around if and when she's ready.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	Look I am a mom and here is my advise ,10 years is long enough and if your mom really loves you she will suck it up and go .So let it be up to her after you tell her this .   Her and your dad divorce you didn't divorce neither so she should respect your plan and hey if she don't then she will be the one looking bad not going to her daughters wedding .So please just ask her why she would let that keep her from the wedding,And tell her it is her own choice that you wish for her to be there but totally up to her .And have a wonderful wedding,It's way past time mom should be over it by now|`|yy45iAbtaa	then if your mother wants to act like a child and not come because she loves you.then go on with your wedding without her.i know you would want her there but if she can't out her own anger aside for you for the happiest day of your life your mom has issues she needs to come to terms with that have nothing to do with you.sorry that your mom is a sick woman and she needs help she will be unhappy for the rest of her life and that is so sad.|`|WauZTodNaa	Explain to her how you feel about her not going. Tell her how much it would mean to you if she was there, and that it is a special day for you and she shouldnt let your father ruin her being there. Be calm, just tell her how you feel. Good luck! God bless.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I'm sorry. Same problem here. We ended up eloping we couldn't handle it. But it still stinks, every family gathering you have to switch off parents and the other is still irked.    I think it's very immature for parents to behave that way.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Your mother is very wrong. I'd tell her that if she didn't deal with it, she will risk missing out on one of the most important events in your life. What will she do if you have children? She cannot be allowed to tell her grandchildren that their grandfather is a horrible person? What about holidays, when more family could be around? She is risking loosing all that over a hissy fit. She is harboring hostile feelings that you cannot condone. Tell her to make her choices wisely (and maybe seek councilling). I wish you peace, but if she won't change her mind, you have to cut her out of the plans....|`|03llfXdpaa	Unfortunately, you can't force her to feel a certain way. It sounds like she needs to go to therapy herself and work out her anger issues. You need to sit her down and calmly tell her how you feel and how much it would hurt you if she wasn't there. She needs to realize that she is being petty. All you can do is talk and tell her how you feel and hopefully she will respond positively. Good luck!|`|WzY2WhGhaa	I think your mother is being selfish and is making you feel bad for something that you need to be celebrating about. Unfortunately if she doesn't want to come to the wedding, that's her issue...easier said than done though.    She's also turning this into a power struggle-- and in her own mind, you are going to lose either way. You'll end up offending someone if you did or didn't invite your dad and his new wife. What your mother needs to do is grow up herself and if she can't get the maturity to realize that this day is supposed to make you happy, maybe it's better if she doesn't come at all.    I would tell her that it's YOUR wedding, not hers. If she chooses to be angry because you want to include people there from your life who are important to you, that's HER problem. HER problem is that she needs to respect the fact that it's your wedding and you can invite who you please and it's HER choice if she won't come and wants to make you feel bad. Say these things calmly and if she gets angry, let her. You dealt with your issues and it's time for her to deal with hers.    I got married myself and I can tell you that someone-- it doesn't matter who, but that someone will always take offense or issue with ANYTHING no matter what. I say get married the way you dam_n well please.|`|AA11661476	My Mom when she married my Dad in 1967 said my grandmother did not want her father to be there.  My grand mother paid for it and my mom had a very very loving stepdad.  This man was my grandfather.  My mom didn't have her real father at her wedding cause of this.    Have a long talk with your mom.  I am going through the same thing with my husband ... His ex family does not want to know me.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Ugh... as a divorced mother of two this annoys me to no end.  I'll never understand why some parents can't think beyond themselves and put their children first.  Tell your mother that you love her and want her to be a part of your wedding.  If she refuses then the problem is hers, not yours, to resolve.  She hasn't come to terms with her divorce and is being rather juvenile to put you in a position of choosing her or your father.  If she chooses not to attend because your father and his wife will be in attendance tell her that you accept her decision.  Then drop it and let her stay home.  It's not your responsibility to force her to cope with her life circumstances and you can't beat yourself up about her lack of acceptance.|`|AA11692548	If you mother wants to digress and act like a 10 year old spoiled child ( which she is), then she shouldn't go to the wedding.  I have seen this problem in my work.  The piece of advice I give is whether it is that important to you to have both parents there.  They both need to keep in mind that this day is about you and not your mother.  Often weddings will bring out the worst in families.  Your mother needs to understand that making you unhappy on your day will surely affect your future relationship with her. Inform her that her hostility and anger need to stop for one day or don't bother to come.  This may bring you pain but at this point ( after ten years), what is the point for her to stay angry with your father? She is not thinking about you but herself. Make it known to her your intentions.  If you don't stick to a firm ground with her, she will continue to use your dad as leverage to get her way.|`|e7dAJAA6aa	You should tell her- "listen this event is not about you, it's about me and my bride to be. I would like it if you could share in celebrating my happiness. If you don't want to join me in celebrating this moment due to some feelings that you have about people that i have invited to the wedding, that's on you. Just know it's important to me that you support me in this moment and not be one more stressful thing that's going on in my life. I love you and understand that my father hurt you but becuase of that you are hurting me and that's not fair." I'd type it up or write it in a letter give it to her and not count on her being at the wedding.     Once you write the letter release all feelings that you have about the whole situation. If she comes it'll be a nice surprise, if she doesn't you won't be surprised.|`|AA10897992	Tell your mother that you want her at your wedding, and if it will make her feel any better tell her to bring a male guest to accompany her. She needs to start acting like an adult and put her personal feelings about your father and his new wife on the back burner, because this is YOUR wedding and not hers. Your father has every right to be at his daughters wedding and walk you down the aisle, regardless how she feels. She can chose to be angry and act any way she wants when she's on her own time. But she needs to be told to behave at the wedding(if she goes) or have her removed just as you would any other guest that behaves inappropriately. If she chooses not to go to the wedding, I would talk to your father in private about just how childish she's acting and how much her decision is hurting you. Sometimes you need to be hard on your parent(s) when you're trying to do something the in the best interest of yourself and everyone else involved. It's not going to be easy but it needs to be done; then the ball is in her court to do the right thing by her daughter. Good Luck with your mother,and Best Wishes in your marriage/future!!!!!!!
FEbT1numaa	Try ...  'Fed up of being used.' It's pretty much to the point! Or maybe just don't talk to them for a while, they might appreciate you more after that.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	I'm here for you, are you for me?|`|eUcLEQCoaa	you should put: Here to be talked to not ignored!|`|aAdmCZAyaa	You only call me when your feeling depressed, when you feel happy Im so far from your mind I don't exist.
JQZzI49Paa	Ignore her|`|2YKUepLjaa	That's frustrating.    some girls just like to play a little hard to get,  she probably doesn't want you to think that she's super hung up on you right away so she's taking her time responding.    That, or she's just busy or in a class or at the gym or something.  Or she left her phone at home, give her time...just don't let her play with your mind too much.    =) good luck!|`|JLjaRYIgaa	shes probably busy... dont think too much|`|dUIUSAu8aa	yeah shes probably busy.. i wouldnt read too much in to it.. if she blows you off at least you tried.|`|qsPyi6Mhaa	She's probably young, and preoccupied. Don't sweat it. Why doesn't anyone call each other anymore???|`|HBKglChlaa	she's probs just a bit busy.  leave it for a while, and if she doesnt reply send her another msg.  if she doesnt reply to that one, then just leave it.  at least you tried (:|`|ks2oieV0aa	She could be busy, school, work, home stuff etc.  be patient  xox|`|bec16h7Taa	Hmm...hard to say. Maybe she's worried its going to be a date and she doesn't know what she wants yet? But then she could just be busy or something if its normal for her not to reply right away.|`|0rt5oCQCaa	she probly is just a lill busy or shes askin her friends opinion|`|owjZhOOhaa	she is probably just busy just give her time to write you back
ks2oieV0aa	Just talk to him and let him know how you feel!  xox|`|Y2Jjwe6Taa	just tell him you care.  if he really loved you he would probably believe you.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	prove u do. open up and tell it like it is.|`|GJjpXeqyaa	sleeping with him almost always work. But just talk it out see whats really going on|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	show him you love him, if you smell what The Rock is cookin.|`|owjZhOOhaa	that is probably just an excuse he is using to cover up the real reason why he broke up with you.|`|Bm4cPW8naa	Tell him that you love him... and prove it... small actions go a long way...do something that he likes that you may not care too much for because that shows you are putting an effort into what he is interested in... actions like that goes a long way and he should see how much you care and love him... hope that helps|`|dUIUSAu8aa	talk to him and find out whats up.. if you dont think you did anything wrong, i wouldnt be going out of my way to please some guy.. and words can only go so far.. if your actions show you love him then he should pick up on it, and if he still has a problem then he's dumber than a box of rocks and its time to move on to the next guy|`|yKhrdGPFaa	well you can tell him you love and care about him and still wanna be with him but actions always speaks louder than words and if you really do care about him and love him then show him show him exactly how much you care and love him and if he doesn't realize it then then thats his lost and that probaly wasn't the reason yall broke up|`|fTVhtE0maa	tell him how you feel. if that does not work, then try to do something to prove to him that you care and that you love him. you just need to tell him and that is all you can do. maybe you could write him a love letter.|`|HBKglChlaa	tell him how much you care, how much you love him and how much you want him back.  if he liked you, he'd believe you! (:  good luck (:|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	talk to him tell him you care about him and love him alot. open up to him and tell him everything that is on your mind. you can tell him all the things of what he does that makes you love him and tell or show him all the reasons of why you care so much to have him in your life. also ask him why it seems like you didnt act like you cared about him. just open your heart to him and show him that you are there for him and want him in your life.
7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	First of all, you need to get rid of this friend. Period. Then put your spare keys in your pocket. You are asking for trouble if you don't. You can get any legal help if you can't prove that he is doing it. Believe me when I tell you that he IS NOT your friend. He's using you.|`|dVgqFDpIaa	call the police|`|hq0VAXDbaa	wow if hes realy close i dont know what im more suprised at... the fact he steals from you or the fact you want to take action, good on you though cuase thats probably the hardest part. just tell the police what you told us and they will take action, make sure your completly honest but be open to the fact that the ps3 might not of been him|`|iFAlZfVMaa	How long ago was this?  Did you file a police report?  Have you moved your sparekeys? Have you changed your locks in case he made copies?    Start with the police report... they may, and often do, ask if YOU hae any idea who did it.      If it's been a consistent time (during the day while you're working) sit on your house with a camcorder... get him in the act.    BEST place to start is the police report...|`|jBEe6Sqdaa	Legally you have no action.  You can't prove it was him (at least you haven't here) and if a key was used then there's no proof you were even burglarized.      You can change you locks, the location of the spare key, and your phone number while your at it.  You need to get this guy out of your life as he will only continue this behavior.      I hope you learned from this expensive lesson.  You can't trust everyone with everything.  Maybe next time you'll keep the location of your hide-a-key (and maybe even your house) to yourself.
9ZnYAfi7aa	alright  so hes "friend" told me that he DOES like you.    but there is an age gap & bc of it hes oping to be in a relationship  BUT there will have to be more than just "making out"|`|njSyZh0Aaa	Man I know what you mean me and my friend have gone through this like one minute he is sweet and so interested and the next he doesnt he doesnt want you but doesnt want anyone else to have you..... I think he may like you but hunnny dont get your hopes up|`|51ne4RkHaa	maybe he does , but doesn't  want to admit it.|`|FY3z8Dq7aa	he likes you for sure. he's just a bit insecure that's why he ignores you sometimes. i mean he likes getting physical with you and that's more than just a guy-friend thing.. when he ignores you sometimes, he's trying to see whether you actually care or not to chase him.|`|RzhKIOHZaa	If you are the only person that he acts this way to, then most likely yes. If you text him and he doesn't reply, that's probably either because he's:    a) Shy. Maybe he feels comfortable talking to you when other people are present so that if anything goes wrong, he'll have his friends to back him up or    b) Busy. If you're hanging with 10 people usually, then he's probably getting text messages from everybody! So that might be why he gives you short answers.    The only way to truly know if he likes you, confront him and ask him if he likes you or not. You can't have a friend do it for you, he might lie to them, so it's best if you ask him yourself.
UpPWXRK4aa	When I used to be on the pill I would miss a few here and there too, and same thing happened. You really can't be missing pills, after say two or 3 times of missing/double dosing/etc it starts to mess with your hormone levels and do funny things like make you bleed that gunk lol. On top of those symptoms you also aren't protected for sure against pregnancy, it takes about 2 weeks of CONSISTENT bc pills in your body at the same time of day, for it to work properly.    Since this is happening it is a sign that you screwed up your pill cycle and should use a condom, probably until your period which is in 2ish weeks. From now til then, if you know you might be missing more pills the next couple weeks just throw this pack away because it really isn't going to do you any good.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	It sounds like you might be pregnant. But first take a pregnancy test, then you should definately go to the hospital regardless of the results, because if you are pregnant you need to begin taking the necessary precautions now, and if you aren't pregnant something can seriously be wrong with your body. Good Luck!|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	I wouldn't go to the hospital, so expensive!  If you can get into the doctor today I would though.  Birth control does strange things to your hormones and periods can become erratic.  As for the abdominal pains, could be period cramps.  I would take some tylenol or advil and put a heating pad on your stomach or take a hot bath until you can see the doc.|`|bec16h7Taa	Birth control is really tricky and it probably has to do with you missing your pills sometimes. You need to talk to a doctor.|`|0le6RYndaa	You need to call the doctor.  Missing pills is something that you definitely should not do. You can get pregnant if you miss pills, and you said you've missed a few.|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Get in to see the doc. Sounds like a miscarriage to me but I am not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination.|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	i wouldnt make an emergency vist to the hospital but i would make an app. with the OBGYN asap|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Try taking your pills properly...it's not that hard!|`|AA11499514	Call your Dr|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Stop missing pills; there's no point in being on the pill if you're not going to take it consistently.  That's just stupid.    If you fail at taking the pill, start using a condom.  Don't bring a child into this world when you're clearly not responsible enough to have one.    Break through bleeding is really common with the pill you're on (I think I know which one, and I took it for a while -- had a period every day for 6 months, whoo hoo, lol).    Now go buy a home pregnancy test and take it.  Be ready for the results.  You probably are not pregnant (sounds like breakthrough bleeding to me, and since it's a new pill, that is entirely possible), but take a test.|`|NyjxygFmaa	Call your doctor. Sometimes you have to be on the pill for awhile before they regulate your period like they are supposed to. Just call your doc to be safe.|`|Kvajun9yaa	Eww that is really gross and i think you need to go see a gynecologist|`|OxDr0zazaa	GO 2 TH3 DOCTOR... AND f...A...S...T|`|5902755f27163f031c036cd6f0fc0367aa	I would say to get an over the counter pregnancy test before you go to the hospital. I do not know the pill you are on but I do know that there are times when the pill takes awhile to work the way it should. I have been in the same situation and it will put you at ease in just a few minutes. I bought if you are pregnant but best to check.  Best of luck.|`|0rt5oCQCaa	GO TO THE F CKING DR  ARE YOU MAD???????    you dont play w/ sh t like that|`|1gKbUuZVaa	the clue you have is...."MISSED A FEW PILLS! with birth control you cant miss any. so take a prego test. they should have explained what could happen if you missed a few pills.|`|X7z0KWXbaa	it is common in the first 6 months of taking any birth control to have irregular  bleeding, nausea, period resembling pains and discharge, normally it is nothing to worry about     if u have been a bit careless with them then i would do a test just to check and ask then about side effects to ur contraception|`|nbf209Hqaa	This is personal and you need to talk to a medical professional. ASAP|`|EyElJfHyaa	thats discusting|`|fktK0xOVaa	um.. im thinking you should go see your doctor sooner than later. it could be you are pregnant, or maybe it's something worse, either way you should definitely seek some doctor help.|`|8SDg4Xy9aa	well if your bleeding your probably not pregnant, or you could have been and you had a miscarriage. If you need to take a pregnancy test though. And you can get your period if you miss a pill, its happened to me before. But if your really worried you can go to your doctor and talk to them about it just incase.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	go take a pregnancy test and make an appt with the gyno. this should be in the women's health section|`|0EYIsRU2aa	Either take the pills properly or don't take them at all. I would definitely see a doctor asap! I had the same discharge problem and I went to the doctor and they changed my BC, there was too much estrogen in them.|`|N3LVlVmnaa	uhm ever hear of calling the doctors office and tell them that instead of asking people on here who most the time don't know wht the hell there talking about .|`|2wiZfK44aa	Hi!    Well First and formost i am sorry that this is happening too you.    You need to take your pills ON TIME EVERYDAY! especialy if your having unprotected sex. My advice to you is too take it before you go to bed every night. thats what i do and it helps me remember.     Also I think that you should make an appointment with your OBGYN, because if your having pregnancy symtoms then thats serious.     i hope you get better (:|`|GHFFbr0Haa	My sister, who is a nurse, told me something that most doctors don't like to admit or dismiss as "Human error": The pill does have a higher fail rate  even when taken appropriately than is generally advertised.     This is due to the fact that the amount of hormones in each pill was reduced in the last couple of decades to reduce side effects: This is why it is SO important not to miss a daily dose AND to take it within the same 2 hour time span every day. I suggest that you try the nuva ring or if you really hate having a period, try the depo-shot: it's nice that you only have to go in and get a shot every three months.     I think two things could be happening:  1.Taking birth control pills not only prevent conception, they regulate your period: Hence why you have those placebos to take if your on the standard monthly pill: stopping the hormones allows the body to menstruate normally. If you continue taking the regular pills, menstruation is delayed or stopped.     So, if you missed more than a few doses, their might not be enough of the birth control hormone left to tell your body not to menstruate: i.e. your body is just doing what it would have done in a couple of weeks anyway. OR, this is a new regimen for you, yes? Perhaps your body is still adjusting to this admittedly unnatural hormone regimen (Your body wants to have a period every month, not every four, so it might not have caught on yet).     2. Missing some doses allowed you to become pregnant, but because of the birth control pills or simple nature, you are shedding the pregnancy. (DO NOT FEEL BADLY IF THIS IS THE CASE. Many pregnancies are shed early on as a newly fertilized egg or a few cells before a woman even realizes she's pregnant, and this has nothing to do with birth control, it's just natural.     Scientist's don't know why this is, but they think it MIGHT be because the body senses something amiss with the fertilized egg. It's also natural to lose a fetus in the first trimester for the same reason (body senses issues with the health of the fetus, or danger for the mother).    In short, you must be very scared. Call your gynocologist if you can, and if she's/he's out, request to have them paged. If this doesn't work, I'd try your family doctor as he knows you and your history much, much better than someone in the ER. Last resort, DO go to the ER.     If you are bleeding heavily, go STRAIGHT to the ER and make sure they know you are bleeding very, very heavily,    Don't second guess yourself, or feel embarrassed. If you're sensing something is amiss, most of the time you're right (although, it may not be serious or life threatening).     I hope that helped. :-)
wrVRj1O5aa	It's so cold there right now and you should dress warm and formal long sleeves black dress or a winter color. remember it's cold but it's a wedding and everybody is looking.

Make sure you find sensible heels or flats and nice coat to wear to keep you warm.|`|A6MQuHfbaa	you can never go wrong with a classic black dress|`|qVgr5OBeaa	Black dress pants, heels, and nice top.

If she likes you, she'll respect that you told her the truth. I'd be a bit put out at first, but then I think I'd be okay with it. Maybe you should've said something like 'I liked your hair better before'?|`|TTogBTYxaa	What a stupit thing to say to a girl?

That should save some face.    Then tell her you were only trying to see if your new date/relationship could survive a little strife right away.    Heck....tell her it was a bet you had with some friends....and you are using the money you won to take her out to a really nice place (her choice)|`|F9amJRzbaa	well i agree you probally lost alot of respect from her . call  her tonight, and tell her to look out the window. talk about the sky, if its cloudy be like. it looks liike its guna be really gross out tomorwow, maybe i can call you and we can both stay inside and talk to eacohther.. ooor if its starey, say its really beautiful out.  then get to the main point...  ttell her that you regret what you said yestuday, and that you are sorry. tell her you still think shes amazingly gorgeous, and that you just dont like change. and that you grew to oknow her with her old hair color, it was just weird.|`|dDSuBQURaa	I would rather club you silly instead.

Maybe he doesn't like children.|`|AA10529198	He is definitely beating off in his spare time.|`|hGpDwj2daa	Perhaps a side effect of some form of medication (legal or illegal) or maybe alcohol related.  If he answers no to all, definately shaking the stick too much.|`|36Ps6EO7aa	By your comments and the fact that he can make himself come very easily, it's probably the result of too much masturbating.  Some men over the years get so use to ejaculating from their own hand, that's it's hard for a woman to get them off.  The real answer is for him to stop masturbating and get totally use to the touch, and feel of a woman to achieve orgasm.  If your good at it (and some women are better than others), he might not want to use the hand anymore.  I got over that when I was about 22.  I prefer a woman any day of the week and it doesn't take me too long to make it!
pma90Xycaa	It all depends on his age.  The older the man gets, the longer it will take for him to recover.  I learned this in an Anatomy class.  When a man is up into like his 70s/80s, he'll usually need a day or two to "recover" before he can build up more.  Hope this helps! :-)|`|DlCcFu1eaa	When I was younger I think my record was something like 11 times in an afternoon. Now at 50 if I get in 2 rounds in a day I'm doing good.    Keep in mind that a lot of things can effect a males ability to preform. Few guys realize that sudafed, Advil and asprin can prevent erection because they don't say it on the lable. If a guy gets a 4 hour hard on from Viagra like they warn you about on the comercials, the treatment the doctor will give you is sudafed.|`|0Id85yiYaa	replenish?|`|u1uECuFNaa	DAYS?

It doesn't take days, unless you are really old, like 60.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Sperm-wise, only about 15-30 minutes.  But if it was a very energetic session, his back or other muscles might hurt for a couple of days, or he might be winded for a day.

Me and my boyfriend went as far as parking on the side of the highway to get our kicks, lol the cars wer passing us by and it was really like wow, ok another place i would say is get 2 balnkets and some candles and go to the beach at night even if its cold you guys will heat up fast.... if the candles dont stay lit who cares.

In a ball pond   In a changing cubicle at a local swimming pool  In the stockroom at my old place of work    But some other good ideas would be to try places where you know you will put yourself at imminent risk of getting caught, so like a barn on a farm, telephone kiosk, next door neighbors garden shed, etc...

If she is totally offended or gets mad, it would be a bad thing anyway, but If she laughs and says yes or gives you a smart *** answer back you have a smart funny girl.|`|dVgqFDpIaa	hi baby.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	No don't ask that.

The path to womens hearts is open for the entire world to see, yet the wanting huntsman too often puts his quarry on pedestal so high he can not see the desired targets weakness.   Keep the target within your sights trapper.  If you look close to the core, you will see her desired valentine is frozen and securely encased in ice.  But fear not for her health, it is a protective shell and will open for passions yet to come from one who can ignite a spark.  The greatest fires can only commence when there is fuel to burn, oxygen and a little heat.   Combustion will commence with friction and to gain enough warmth, you will need to stay close in spirit.  A close union will turn to a spark only when a friendship has come to past.    In other words, be friends with her but dont wait for someone else to ask her out.   As to what to say.. She is your friend, what would you say to a friend.|`|1Crt9jQXaa	no dont ever ask 'do you like me'  that sounds like you are really insecure and unstable  just compliment her and smile and ask how shes doing. find something you both have in common and just talk about it and make jokes  make her feel at ease|`|chLUktZNaa	try complimenting her about her hair or clothes.

Specially in a case when this woman has undergone a lot of mental trauma as a child , who never trusted her father even, and she always observed her father hiding things and lying to her mother. Although he was caring enough to fulfill her needs but was always unfaithful and being a womanizer kept on switching from one extramarital relation to other. So her religious mother died young  due to a sudden heart attack trying to prove herself a devoted, caring, loving wife and mother leaving behind too daughters.( her father remarried without even bringing it in to the knowledge of his own daughters after lying to them that he is going for an official tour) The elder one took over the role of mother for her younger sister keeping aside all her own  joys and pleasures as a young woman.  So how is she going to trust his lover if she identifies his acts as that of her unfaithful father?  Then another complexity is that whether this Man will continue loving her and accept her even after knowing about her father, which she never- ever shared with any of closest of  her friends in her entire life, because it was always very painful for her to see her friends fathers loyal to  their wives. She never even shared this thing in her previous relation , as she was always scared of being judged on the basis of her fathers attitudes.  Now through her profession she is trying to bring couples together, understand each other in a better manner, children close their parents so that she can see all of them living as HAPPY FAMILIES?

You can't disown your father unless he is abusive towards you, or he is threatening your life in harmful ways. If he is just a let down, well, i guess it depends what it was, but otherwise you'll need to contact a social worker which that isn't the best situation, it's a sticky procedure, and takes a lot of time. There's this other thing that allows you to be on your own...but that takes  A LONG time, is hard to even get and you usually get stuck back with a social worker.    Just wait until you are considered a legal adult in the UK and you can just forget about him then. Thats what i am down to now.    Take care.   Or, google it

IT IS suffering to live. That is what Ryunosuke Akutagawa, a popular writer in early 20th-century Japan, wrote shortly before committing suicide. However, he prefaced that statement with the words: Of course, I do not want to die, but .?.?.    Like Akutagawa, many of those who take their life do not want to die as much as they want to end whatever is going on, stated one psychology professor. The wording so commonly found in suicide notes suggests as much. Such phrases as I could not take it any longer or Why go on living? show a deep desire to escape lifes harsh realities. But as one expert described it, committing suicide is like treating a cold with a nuclear bomb.    Although the reasons why people commit suicide vary, certain events in life commonly trigger suicide.    Triggering Events    It is not uncommon for young ones who give in to despair and commit suicide to do so even over matters that may seem trivial to others. When they feel hurt and cannot do anything about it, youths may view their own death as a means of getting back at those who have hurt them. Hiroshi Inamura, a specialist in handling suicidal people in Japan, wrote: Through their own death, children cherish an inner urge to punish the person who has tormented them.    A recent survey in Britain indicated that when children are subjected to severe bullying, they are nearly seven times as likely to attempt suicide. The emotional pain that these children suffer is real. A 13-year-old boy who hanged himself left behind a note naming five people who had tormented him and had even extorted money from him. Please save other children, he wrote.    Others may try to take their life when they get into trouble at school or with the law, suffer the end of a romance, get a bad report card, experience stress over exams, or become weighed down by worries about the future. Among high-achieving adolescents who may tend to be perfectionists, a setback or a failurebe it actual or imaginarymay bring on a suicide attempt.    For adults, financial or work-related problems are common triggering events. In Japan after years of economic downturn, suicides recently topped 30,000 a year. According to the Mainichi Daily News, almost three quarters of the middle-aged men who killed themselves did so because of problems stemming from debts, business failures, poverty and unemployment. Family problems too may lead to suicide. A Finnish newspaper reported: Recently divorced middle-aged men make up one of the high-risk groups. A study in Hungary found that the majority of girls who contemplate suicide were reared in broken homes.    Retirement and physical illness are also major triggering factors, especially among the elderly. Often suicide is chosen as a way out, not necessarily when an illness is terminal, but when the patient views the suffering as intolerable.    However, not everybody reacts to these triggering events by committing suicide. On the contrary, when faced with such stressful situations, the majority do not take their life. Why, then, do some view suicide as the answer, while most do not?    Underlying Factors    Much of the decision to die is in the construing of events, says Kay Redfield Jamison, professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She adds: Most minds, when healthy, do not construe any event as devastating enough to warrant suicide. Eve K. Mo?cicki, of the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, notes that many factorssome of them underlyingwork together to lead to suicidal behavior. Such underlying factors include mental and addictive disorders, genetic makeup, and brain chemistry. Let us consider some of them.    Foremost among these factors are mental and addictive disorders, such as depression, bipolar mood disorders, schizophrenia, and alcohol or drug abuse. Research in?both Europe and the United States indicates that more than 90 percent of completed suicides are associated with such disorders. In fact, Swedish researchers found that among men who were not diagnosed with any disorders of that kind, the suicide rate was?8.3 per 100,000, but among the depressed it jumped to 650 per 100,000! And experts say that the factors leading to suicide are similar in Eastern lands. Still, even the combination of depression with triggering events does not make suicide inevitable.    Professor Jamison, who once attempted suicide herself, says: People seem to be able to bear or tolerate depression as long as there is the belief that things will improve. However, she has found that as the cumulative despair becomes unbearable, the ability of the mental system to restrain suicidal impulses gradually weakens. She likens the situation to the way that the brakes on a car are worn thin by constant stress.    It is vital to recognize such a tren|`|XGgPhaDbaa	OK I'm going to be real serious here.    Why would you try to kill yourself because you are hurting from a breakup? Everyone goes through many breakups and hardships and pain. Yeah, you are going to hurst for a little while but you will get over it.    On the other hand, if you kill yourself your family will NEVER get over it. Please do not be so selfish and self absorbed to commit suicide and hurt all the people that love you.    You just need to talk and cry about it and then you will start getting over it in a couple weeks.

So if anything is wrong with the car like maybe it got impounded insurance ain't covering it because you didn't call right away.|`|75zggy81aa	YES!!! I would have called two and a half weeks ago!|`|zz9slNFlaa	shes screwing her own life over, u caling the cops on her might straighten her life out....think about it|`|BvfTVj7Yaa	I would call the police because there ain't no telling where she went especially when shes doing drugs. but that's just my opinion.|`|FndjFPPaaa	yes definitley she should take responsibilty for her own actions. Since she doesn't then the phone call is necessary.|`|XGgsxhD8aa	thats a really dumb question, call the cops.|`|YuZ8QHMLaa	Call the police.  If you don't want her to get into too much trouble, tell them That she's missing.
J2VVwzJQaa	i think she does because otherwise she wouldnt hav been so hurt. do you like her? if you do i think you should apologise and tell her how u feel. if you dont like her, i think you should still apologise. she must like to behave like this.  hope it helps  x x x|`|H5q22PSxaa	What? That is really confusing.|`|H84n72Nlaa	SHE OBV DOES! u just embarassed her :) dunnn worry|`|EzovLAP4aa	some thing you can't tll another woman, they talk to much, if you like a girl you two are talking keep us out of it. until you have each other wrap up.
Uj5kuzoJaa	This answer is really up to you. Just realize that this makes everything WAAAAYYYY more complicated. I mean it's hard enough to deal with boyfriends ex-girlfriends when they're not around, and now this one has an excuse to be around for the rest of their childs life. Also if she turns out to be a b.i.t.c.h. she can easily throw some insecurity into the mix. I had a friend in this same situation so I know first hand. The baby's momma was saying things like "When he comes over to get his kid, you know he sleeps with me right?" When it wasn't even true, but now she thinks that it may be true you know? Also you have to watch how he reacts to his ex and his baby. If he treats them both like crap, he'll probably do the same to you if you end up in the same situation. And just because she got preggo doesn't mean that he wasn't using protection. You can get pregnant even if you do use protection. This is a really sticky situation your in. If you can, I wouldn't get involved. But if you really like him then just realize that this is going to be a lot of work to keep things good.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	SO, his GF is pregnant, so he tries to get in your pants?    Bad vibes here.    Stay away from this one.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Ugh - so much baggage! The fact he isn't with his baby mamma or even caring about his child makes me think you should run for your life.    He obviously doesn't really have enough mind to wear protection. Trust me - you deserve better.|`|TufsEE2baa	run away|`|51ne4RkHaa	i should get away, before all the ex girlfriend drama starts|`|SBMxJdyraa	stay away frm him.......such guys arent gud they jus wanna use nd throw people so dont be used and just go away from him.............he is not a gud person...........|`|UNryBT1naa	and?|`|AA12374498	If I were you, I would stay away if you're not prepared for lots of drama in your future.|`|ldmSmaKqaa	bad real bad|`|574RUrfdaa	hell no|`|xfbHTGU4aa	Since you just met him i would just run the opposite way.I'ts alot of baggage and drama that comes with the baby momma thing most of the time.
v6MvF2Mgaa	Do NOT do it! Stats show that 70% of all marriages in the US that start when one or both people are under 21 end in divorce. That number jumps to 85% when 18 or below.    Move in together if you want but don't get married. It won't last and you will end up a divorcee!|`|s0idL7szaa	I thnk both of u should first talk with ur parents, then they will suggest u good that what u guys should do and what is best fro both of u.      If both of u are in love then my suggestion to u that this love, frndship etc all is just timely feelings. so be careful.    Thanks|`|q411DXsFaa	Nope. Your mom and dad have to consent it...I was married at 16|`|rH33ty23aa	My advice is probably not what you want to hear, but if you love him so much that you wanna spend the rest of your life with him, then at least wait till your older. It will be much to hard on you especially financially. The divorce rate is so high that statistically if you get married at 16 you hav a 98% chance you will be divorced by the time you are 18 or 19. Ya ya your thinking that wont happen we really love each other. its that kind of thinking that means you need to wait. You are still a child and are not ready to be a wife.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	you have to have consent and emancipation takes a long tiem, you will only be emancipated if a case worker find that yo uare in a sbusive relationship with your parents otherwise your going ot have to wait two more years. Chances are in two years you will want to marry someone else.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Whats your rush?     If you are in love and will be together forever, then you have all the time in the world...    Be patient. You will appreciate a lovely wedding that you can afford, and a home to be carried across the threshold.|`|buHCijQOaa	I wouldn't do it if I were you. You're still a confused teenager like the rest the rest of us. If he really loves you and you really love him, you'll be able to wait a couple of years.  Good luck!
xoXkHOVsaa	If he's not dating this other girl yet, then there is still hope.  Talk to him and tell him why you want to get back together.  He might say no, but at least you will have tried and it will give you the closure you need to move on.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Did you want him back before you heard he was interested in someone else? It's possible you're just jealous about it and you're feelings aren't really true. I would think about it a bit before you make any moves. If you think your feelings are real, maybe discuss it with him. Be prepared that he doesn't feel the same way.|`|zLk8m6kuaa	love is a two way relationship... if he doesn't like you then its over. might as well build the friendly bridge between you two and in the same time date someone else.. don't waste your time for one person only... there's a lot of guy out there.. just try to open up your mind....|`|2AoNw9Omaa	talk to him. tell him how you feel and let your emotions flow out to him. this has happened to me a few times and it worked for me so i hope it helps you too. good luck!:)|`|oEmBeyUPaa	well that same situation happened to me and i got him back. so i would talk to him about your feelings and tell him how you feel so he at least knows how you feel also tell him that people have told you that he likes someone and ask if its true and also at the same time during all this flirt with other guys in front of him to make him jealous and make him want you and miss you :)
ZSznCJhSaa	Sounds like the second is the one for you.     Go with your heart, not what other people think, though. :)    Good luck.|`|qNkFMv8Naa	Yeah u need to flip a coin.|`|fffKTnMCaa	Well it sounds like you like the second boy more. But you are still tied to the first one. I know what I have done in the past, I had just about the same problem. Except it wasn't two and three years, haha. It was more a year, and six months. Anyways, I would talk to both of them about it. Well, separately. You don't want world war three! (:
jWMXi3Lnaa	Well obviously you will have to earn it. You can start by getting another job. This will show them that you are willing to support some of your college tuition and manage money wisely. Also, getting involved in clubs and social events helps because it takes responsible action. You can't just go out partying and sleeping. This next one might sound stupid, but also getting a girlfriend/boyfriend. Being in college and a relationship just screams responsiblity because you have so many priorities to juggle|`|K1oOQqqVaa	It's pretty simple really.  Act more adult and responsible.  Have you done childish and irresponsible things that might tend to give them the impression that they should not do it?  You must have the answer to your own question.  Think about it.  Put yourself in their place.  What would you want to see?|`|BkMjabPvaa	since you have a job why not buy a cheap one at a used cares place for like 10,000 or less and get your own shyte|`|WvAwQmndaa	Sit them down and talk to them. Explain what you did in this question. I mean most kids don't work at all. They expect their parent's to pay for everything. I think its amazing that you've been working for 3 years already. That should be a big red flag to them that you're ready for more responsibility and freedom!     If that doesn't work, you could always just move out. You're over 18 so technically you don't have to do anything they say. You're an adult. he he.       :-)|`|67EaIAvbaa	your 19...tell them your not 16|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Your risk-reward ratio will go through the roof.    Be grateful (and I really mean that) that you can live  on campus and get a college education.    Don't become greedy or studpid.  Be thankful|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|fQgbBx7caa	Usually parents are the smart ones, is there a reason are you a bad driver?  Past accidents?  They why did they buy it for you?|`|47Et6CaHaa	Dude **** em, you're 19. Most places in the world classify you as an adult, you can do as you wish. You don't need your parents permission to move out. Just explain to them that the chick's gotta fly the nest some day.|`|dcf7ee408eb7247b8858f93e4117f77daa	Seventeen magazine suggested: Offer to cook your family a meal, and tell your folks you want to do everything: plan the meal, make the grocery list, budget, shop, cook, clean up. And if cooking is not your forte, look around and see what else can be cared for. You dont need a specific decree from your parents to act when there are dishes to be washed, floors to be swept, or rooms to be straightened up.    Many youths take on part-time work during the summer or on weekends. If this is true in your case, have you proved that you are capable of saving and managing your money? Have you volunteered to make a contribution for your room and board? (You might find it eye-opening to check the going rate for renting a room in your community.) Doing so might mean less pocket money, but as your folks observe your grown-up way of handling money, they will no doubt be inclined to give you more freedom.|`|NLxCpn8iaa	If you're worried about being close enough to home in case of "major trouble", you may not be ready.  Listen, living at home for awhile while you are in college can be a GOOD thing.  Don't rush it.  Maybe wait till your junior year, that way, you and your parents will all be a bit more ready for it!|`|0AjyzHUHaa	Are you an only child, if so it makes sense...it would be called empty nest syndrome.  But if you're not, then maybe you should think if freedom of your own apartment is worth giving up a car, public transportation, counting on friends, or moving close enough to where you need to go so that you can walk there would be the next option.  It's not about responsibility, it's more so about you being 19 and an adult you shouldn't have to ask your parents for any thing, you should be able to provide for yourself...so that car is THERE car, not yours, and if you want a car, you may need to save up and get one on your own.    Your parents holding back shows that they want you to have more responsibility (or that they're just mad and don't want you to leave the nest...) either way, more responsibilities will have to kick in.|`|LroAwfA1aa	get the bus.............or buy your own car your not a baby anymore........|`|tGlnumvKaa	You should be paying for all of the insurance, the car payment and the gas if you want to take the car with you. You will have to prove you're responsible in other areas first. Do you pay your bills on time every time? Do you go to work on time? When you're at work do you do your job or are you just there for the money?  Do you clean up your own messes when you're at home? Do you offer to do the housework, shopping or cooking at home?     Parents look for things like this when deciding maturity of their children. A child who does things willingly without being told a million times will be looked upon as mature. If they have ask you to do something (or tell you that you can't do something) and you whine about it, they know that you're not ready.     If you're responsible enough to get an apartment, you should be responsible enough to buy your own car, take care of the license plates, insurance and buy gas for it.     If I were in your shoes, I would buy my own car and live on campus for at least another year.  Moving off campus is basically a reason for other people to come over to your place and party.     I'm not saying that's the reason you want your own place, I'm saying that's what your college friends will think.  I'm going to school and have had college kids to ask me if they can crash at my place, have a party at my place and so on.     Think very carefully about this before making a decision. Do you have enough money in the bank to pay the bills at an apartment in case you can't work? Can you afford food, rent, utilities, and renter's insurance? If you had to, could you also afford a car payment without borrowing off your parents or friends?  Do you have the energy needed to keep an apartment clean while you're working and going to school?      Set up a realistic budget. Find out how much rent, utilities and renter's insurance is in the area.    Add 14 months worth of rent payments and divide by 12. That will give you a cushion in case the rent goes up.      Now figure up 14 month's worth of renter's insurance (yes it's necessary!) and divide that by 12 also in case it goes up.     Add in cable, internet, phone, electricity and water.     Add everything together then add 20%.to the total.     Divide that by 12. That is roughly how much you will need each month to live on. And you should have at least 12 times that much in the bank to fall back on and remember you can't figure up your budget with the expectation of borrowing from anyone in case you can't afford it.     When you get your figures together, take them to your parents and show them that you have a budget ready for next semester and that you will stick to it. It may take a while to prove it, but that's a great way to show responsibility.       Good luck!|`|zU1hrRIgaa	Tell them what you just pointed out. That you'll pay for everything, and you're a mature adult who can handle it.|`|6FC45oGMaa	don't be me  just act more responsible and they will trust u more hope it works for u 
N1wUHYKlaa	what i've done to divide rooms (living spaces in the military....) is to get shear curtains, thread a thin rope through them, and hang them from the ceiling. depending on the type of ceiling you have (like the regular drywall kind, or the hanging ceilings) you can attach the rope many different ways. and you can get fancy curtains from a goodwill or salvation army! like lacey ones, or the sheer white ones. may take a few of the curtains, but you can bunch them up to add more "privacy" or leave them kinda layed out to create the sheer effect from looking through them.|`|AA10787865	Contact the place you're renting from first. They might have done this many times and have the proper dividers or they can put you in touch with a company that will rent them to you for a reasonable price.|`|sGP6s7uraa	http://www.weddingsfromabove.ca/images/d...    http://www.tent-suppliers.com/pcat-gifs/...  This is outside but do you see how the curtains are gathered?  have the curtians hang from the ceiling and then gather in the middle like the picture and it would make it feel like a tent of sorts.      http://www.robeysfabrics.com/images/Soir...    http://render1.snapfish.com/render2/is=Y...    http://www.fortworthcatering.com/images/...    http://render1.snapfish.com/render2/is=Y...|`|f7l9byFGaa	What I would do is make flower streamers made out of flowers that you are using in the wedding.  Then you can always hang them with tacks or something from the ceiling and it will look really nice and still look like a curtain.
FHu7pHhRaa	your bf will marry you when the time comes! Try getting counselling for your problem and hostil approach to differences, and your attitude - then he'll probably notice the difference in you, and be more likely to propose to you!  x|`|g4AAZRuxaa	You should be able to communicate with each other otherwise don't get married.|`|tDbBLZrraa	Why would he committ and marry  what he has been able to get 4free for 5yrs..Dont cry now for what you have allowed for this long..|`|faOBk7qtaa	One question at a time.    Have you talked to him about your ambitions to be married? Five years seems very long, are you even living together yet? Communication is best, let him know your goals and feelings.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The antidote to decreasing your hostility is listening better.  When someone says something and you feel yourself disagreeing, stop yourself, and instead paraphrase what the person said back to him.  Ask him questions about it.  Ask him how it makes him feel.  Tell him your understanding of what he just said and ask him if it sounds like you have it right.  Showing another person that you're really listening to him is an excellent way to prevent hostility.    And I think you're at least 2 years overdue regarding marriage question.  I agree with some other people - he's probably thinking, "Why buy the cow when I'm getting the milk for free?"|`|oEOo9U7iaa	Why do you have to spoil everything by proposing marriage?|`|Bo49sEX2aa	I bet you are living with him right?  No, he would have proposed by now if he wanted to marry you.  You give him no reason to marry you if you have been living with him. How old are you?  And yes, hostility is probably because you are pissed he hasn't asked you already.    Why would a man want to marry someone hostile...?|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Well things change in time and we grow while we are in a relationship. But don't think he will ever marry you until you grow as an individual on your communication. This is the key in marriage and he is so right to make you wait..|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Have you asked him that question?

y6gVmhHxaa	It's not a written rule but weekend weddings tend to be more considerate for your guests.  They don't have to take time off of work or rush to go after work then stay out late on a weeknight.  If you are planning a small affair then it should be fine but a weeknight may not work for a ton of people if you are planning a larger affair.|`|4POGapREaa	There's no rule about it, it's just normally inconvenient for people who work full time.  I guess it depends on who you're inviting & what their schedules are like.  A lot of people don't want to use one of their very few vacation days that they work so hard for to attend someone else's wedding.  If it's in the evening, I would go but attending an event after a full day's work & still having to get up early or for some people having to pick up their kids & then get a sitter, etc.  It's just not ideal but whatever you want to do, I'm sure people will work it out.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  No, there is no unwritten rule.  The only thing is that most people have to work, so it's difficult to get to a wedding during the week AND, then, of course, they need to work the next day so any late night drinking and partying is out.      So....that is the reason why most couples choose Saturday.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	So?  There is no law that says you can't get married through the week.  It's just easier for people to come if the wedding is on a weekend.  Then they can party and have a good time at the reception without having to worry about getting up for work the next day.|`|KSEtqVT3aa	The problem would be for your guests... most people will have work during that day, and the next day, so you pose a problem for them. Weekends are easier.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Having it on the weekend is just more convenient for people who work (which is just about everyone).|`|AA12268495	If the actual date of 4/7/09 holds a special significance for you, then you should hold the wedding on that day. However, I would suggest including a brief statement in the invitations explaining the reason (so guests aren't left to wonder why you are holding a wedding on a Tuesday)     But the following Saturday, hold a large reception for all guests to attend. Most people aren't going to be able to make a mid-week wedding ~ but they may still want to celebrate with you. You can still have a small get together the night of the wedding ~ for cocktails, dessert ~ something small & simple. But definitely save the large party for the following Saturday & wait to leave for your honeymoon until Sunday.    Hope this helps, congrats on your wedding :)|`|kG9oI68eaa	isnt it traditional to get married on a saturday|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Nope. People are just more able to come on a weekends because they are off work. Unless you are doing it in a church, some religions have specfic days.|`|woOeYFrEaa	Most people pick a weekend simply to make it easier on their guests. If you're expecting people to come in from out of town then having a mid-week wedding means they have to take vacation days from work to attend your wedding.  Also, if you want your wedding to run late into the evening, you'll have people ducking out since they have work in the morning.  Get home to get their kids to bed since they have school in the morning, etc.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's just easier on your guests to have a weekend wedding.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	we are having ours on a wed. and most people will be coming.     i have found that trying to get people to gatherings that more people will take the time during the week than on their precious weekends.    neither of us works 9-5 jobs so its easier for us to have a week day wedding. also our guests will be coming form all over the world (and most of them are taking the time btw! because its cheaper to travel and stay in hotels during the week    the wed is the anniversary of the day we met.     oh and we decided five months ago and had most things booked within two days because all the venues are free and i did not have to wait a year or two to have my wedding on a sat|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I got married on a Tuesday (Aug 29, 2007). the important thing is to pick a date that is significant to you and a date that you will both remember.|`|crxbob5jaa	Most people get married on the weekend because it's easier on the guests. However, if most of your guests are in town, a week night is perfectly acceptable. And you will get off with spending less money because venues are less expensive mid-week.|`|VjxG2p6Raa	I dont think there is a rule- BUT...it is completly unfair to ask ALL the guest to take time off from work to attend your wedding. In many peoples cases...it hurts to miss a day of pay or have to use oh so precious vacation time, which some people might not even have.  I think you will get less of a turnout as well.    Have it on a weekend.  Although a weekday will be cheaper for you (because no one has them on weekdays for good reason)    If you have it on a weekday....you have to realize there will be some unhappy campers, they will just not let you know.

Since you are new to the dating game...you haven't yet experienced the horrible feeling of being lied to. Lame excuses and being led on are two of the worst things about dating. Instead of wondering what you should tell him, tell him the truth and maybe y'all will be friends after wards. Telling him "my parents changed their mind" or something of similar sorts will only cause problems when you are ready to date someone else.

It will hurt both of you at first but telling him the truth is the right thing to do.|`|WdW1ga14aa	Tell him exactly what you just told us.  Tell him the truth that you were extremely flattered that he asked you out but at that moment you said yes but now that you have thought about it, your really not ready for a committed relationship so you would like to remain friends with him  Good luck|`|7049bf1f288a6b18613b5892449d32a7aa	wow! sounds like you have a problem. Maybe just sit him down and say..i am really happy that you asked me out but i just dont see us as being more than friends. I want to still be friends but i think that would be best??|`|GzL8X6vTaa	Just tell him sooner then later.    It is hard to spare feelings but the sooner that it is the easier that it might be.|`|3EBKrVrDaa	Just tell him you're not ready for a relationship and you just want to be friends. If he's really a good guy he'll understand.|`|tNVaEig7aa	girl you should do what you think is right   if you like him then date him no mater what you parents say  kk|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	be honest and tell the truth. if you lie and he finds out, he will definitely be hurt.|`|peeC1ECfaa	be honest!|`|6XqY0istaa	Don't tell him your parents changed their minds, don't tell him you like someone else instead, and DON'T give him junk food!  Kindness and honesty are the principles to follow here.  You're right- waiting a couple of weeks would make it harder on you AND on him.  Tell him right away that you were excited about the idea of having a boyfriend but that you didn't think about it seriously enough and you actually are not ready to date (him).  Don't give him hope that someday you will change your mind.  Tell him you want to be friends (emphasis on that word) but that is all.  Try not to date the very next boy who ask you.  ;)  Good luck, chica, and welcome to the dating world!|`|oN92aOUraa	Hi Sparkles   There really is no way to tell a guy you are not ready for a boyfriend. So the best thing to di is be honest and tell him that it is nice but your not ready.  I am sure he will not speak to you again for a little while but if he really liked you he will  get over it.   Good Luck|`|k4I9dG0Caa	tell him you parents changed their mind|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Give him a bag of Funyuns.|`|uIlmjJjhaa	Honestly, there is NO easy way to tell him. But try and tell him as gently as possible. It hurts.. i know.|`|J3VSkIE9aa	tell him the truth|`|lk0UMYpTaa	Well.....Talk to him....say you were just jumpy to have a boyfriend maybe after time you can actully become something more than friends. :)|`|kJeRAg5Kaa	lady,even we guys have feelings.when u felt u wanted a bf u said yes to him.now u feel u dont need one u'll dump him.try to know him better u mite start to like him.  trust me all guys hate this line--"i like you but only as a friend".even if u dump him dont say this to the least|`|wVydrlFWaa	You've said two different things here: first, you said you only liked this boy as a friend. Then, you said you weren't ready to have a boyfriend. Which is the actual reason you don't want to date him?    Either way, you're going to have to be honest with him. If you're really not interested in him in particular, and you start dating someone else, he's going to find out about it. If you're really not ready to have a boyfriend at all, then he might be a little disappointed, but at least he'll know it wasn't his own fault.
fUBWB88laa	You need to go in to a few stores and try them on. Normally enhancers are meant for solitaires or a thin band...since three stones are obviously a wider band, most enhancers will not fit them properly. You need to just got to a few places and try them on that's the only way you'll know for sure.|`|r5AbT6tmaa	Have not seen them but you can have anything custom made to fit your ring.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	They had a large selection of those when we looked @ Kay Jewelers.
crxbob5jaa	I know a conservative bride, and her bridesmaids booked a suite at a local hotel. Actually it was a Residence Inn type suite so they would have plenty of bedroom/bathroom space. They went to dinner, went swimming, played games, watched movies, and had all sorts of old fashioned slumber party fun. They told her it was her last slumber party before marriage. She loved it!|`|0Id85yiYaa	you could make it a lingerie party, where the guests bring her something to wear on the honeymoon. or a pleasure party. it's like a tuperware party for sex toys. there's always strippers. or for something low key, a spa day.|`|woOeYFrEaa	I loved mine and I guess you could call me "conservative".    My girls made a whole day of it.  Here's our itinerary:  - Brunch around 10am  - Paint your own pottery place for a couple hours (they picked out pieces to give me as a wedding gift)  - Afternoon snack of cheese and fruit at a wine tasting  - Pedicures and manicures  - Quick stop to change outfits and off to a fancy dinner    It was so much fun spending a whole day with my best friends!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Ask her her favorite restaurant.  Book a private room to that restaurant.  Have appetizers served (meals paid by the guests) as well as coffee, water and tea.  Use her favorite color or the colors of the wedding to decorate.  Get a cake in those colors.  Supply goodie bags with lotions, lip glosses, body sprays, candles etc.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	How about a dinner and then some dance lessons?  You can do something raunchy like pole dancing or striptease, or something more conservative like salsa. Most dance instructors will do private lessons, and may even be able to help provide partners (if not, all the girls can partner up with each other for ballroom/salsa dancing).    Spa days are also nice if you can book off the entire morning or afternoon so that only your party will be there.    Is there a local theatre performing something fun any time soon?  Dinner and a show would also be lovely.

LOL!!!!! He can't do a lot of things that women can do like hmmm give birth.|`|mDw65XGbaa	just tell him you will find someone better then him, it usually works|`|b2mp5C9oaa	id say...ya your prolly right cuz i am just a girl anyways so men are better than me...|`|GzL8X6vTaa	Say that you all ready have because you aren't with his dumb *** anymore.|`|e5O7hQb8aa	no, i couldn't get any worse than you.|`|435c271Kaa	If someone is saying that to you, don't you think you should think about what kind of relationship you are in? This is a controlling comment, and if you stay around and tolerate it, you are in a co- dependent relationship. This is unhealthy.|`|IyLpIObcaa	Easy.  Piss him off.  Grab your nearest girl friend and say "I already have."  I've never told a woman that, but I have been told by girls several years later that they just aren't able to do better than me.  It's a great ego boost, but if someone goes off on an undeserved ego trip like that... put him in his place!    OG  Neuro Awakening|`|q0e5NlBCaa	"Oh wow are all the guys perverted, idiotic freaks that have the maturity of a three month old just like you?"|`|gFHzuIrUaa	OMG some guy said that to me before. I laughed in his face and walked away in front of all his friends they laughed at him too and his pride was so hurt. He never even looked me in the eye again, plus after I left him. I started dating the captain of the football team, then he felt really stupid I'm sure LOL. Try that, (but you don't have to date the captain of the football team though lol)|`|pZuRxAAdaa	say i mite not do better than you but at least i know im not a geek like you, or o well i dont need to do better than you im fine rite where im at. that will really get him pissed cuz your not letting it bother you|`|ZOTHfIOmaa	Say:  "Oh man that's pretty scary since you really suck"|`|f7GGTNjVaa	show him that you can do better! just don't rise to his petty little comments! hes obviously a waste of space|`|10gI6rFKaa	Hold your hand up in front of his face and say..."See these fingers? They've been doing better than you for YEARS"|`|xJBJn6dOaa	You don't need to say anything... find a better-looking, nicer, smarter, and more athletic guy to date and that is the sweetest revenge. good luck!|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Tell him you already have....Many, many times
Vp1Wzu07aa	One of my coworkers has this problem. She finally told the court she could not afford an attorney anymore and they sent them to mediation. After the mediator saw them multiple times with the same complaint (the fathers complaint) the mediator took action and will not allow the ex husband to file the same motions over and over. It helps your case if you get the same judge or mediator every time. I don't know if you have this type of system in your state but it is worth looking into.|`|iVq1byuwaa	tell him you need your children otherwise you can't live. Hopefully if he will understand. gd luck xxx|`|5qvZFVe7aa	I understand your question. My ex- husband has taken me to court a lot in the last 4 years, and have spent over $60,000 to keep my kids also. My ex will not give up until I give up custody. But, I will not. I'm very upset at him.  The legal law sucks! And they let dead - beat parents do this all the time. I believe there should be  a limit of how much time you go to court.
71yXXY3eaa	You should talk this over with someone and perhaps move to a different part of the class room near a friend that understands your condition.  You can be in a very tight and nervous situation if you feel isolated and feel like everyone is different from you.  A relationship is the best way for you to get out of the situation.|`|rHTsKg3kaa	its ok|`|r3jfodBUaa	Well i have some idiot boy friends they joke around but i get embarrassed by them sometimes you just have to get used to it.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	if you really don't get it, then you might want to be moved to a lower class.|`|nv7Cofm5aa	There's nothing to feel embarrassed about. You're in charge of understanding certain materials. Yes, there are professors who will often joke with you (even worst, some classmates). But why bother? You're paying the professor. It's his/her responsibility to make sure you're learning the material you want to learn.     My point is... be confident. Don't pay attetntion to what anybody thinks. Focus on your work.. ask questions you don't understand. Trust me, that is the best way to learn. You'll realize you learn better when things are cleared up. It's about being educated and showing that you are motivated for being educated.     Again, think about your education as a huge investment. This investment is nothing to be embarrassed about. The only thing to be embarrassed about is if you never ask questions... letting this 'huge investment' slip away.     Focus on yourself. Be strong. Life gets better after high school... then again, you're going to have to deal with college... but not as bad.     Good luck.|`|7049bf1f288a6b18613b5892449d32a7aa	I have the same problem. Math is deff not my greatest subject..  So what i decided to do.. was when class was over i went to my teacher and i asked him if there was any time that i could come down and have him show me one on one.. because i feel so stupid when i get something wrong and when we get work to do and everybody know what there doing.|`|izDlfkZXaa	See if your teacher or any other math teachers can help you one-on-one after school.|`|omq3X7wgaa	dont fell embarassed, your learning. learning is trial and error, just pay attention, show up every day and maybe ask those smart kids for help, it may come easier to them because they have a different learning technique that you could benefit from. your in the class with those smart kids and not in remedial math,  for a reason. and think about this, math may come easy to them, but they probably struggle with other subjects - just like you.|`|6f5c461596d36223a4de1ff50d1fe3c1aa	Why should you be embarrassed, not everyone is smart. All you can do is try your best. P.S. I hated math too.|`|2AoNw9Omaa	just be confident in yourself. instead of having the teacher help you everyday, ask him if you can quietly get help from a neighbor. then ask one of the smartest people beside you in class.good luck!:)|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	i understand your dilemma. i was a straight A student in math, but english just killed me. and yes i would get embarrassed when the work was handed out and i would just sit there and look at it and look around looking for help. bottom line is we all have our good classes and our bad classes, just accept the fact that math is not your strength. i'm pretty sure you do well in other classes. not all of us are scientists or models or football players concentrate on your strengths and don't place so much emphasis on your weaknesses.|`|MHcxmjP8aa	I think there is a very high percentage of people who do not work well with math. I'm one of them. Take that fact into consideration and realize that you may not be the only one in that class in particular that may need help as well. It just seems as if they all get it, trust me, there is at least one other person that does not get it either. So don't beat yourself up over it, just ask questions this way you don't regret it in college like I do.
mAPSl0DZaa	When Harry Met Sally  Gone with the Wind but then you will have to read the sequal together.(Scarlett) time consuming but worth it.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	None.  You don't want to put the pressure on her...and a romance movie might do just that...and totally put her off!    Just watch a regular movie vs a "date" or "chick's" movie... and have no expectations. If it's meant to be it will happen without any manipulation on your part.|`|Zvf6ulXnaa	A walk in the Clouds!    Its super cute about a guy who comes back from war to find his so called wife and him have absolutly nothing in common and well he meets this amazing girl and pretends to be her husband so her parents wont freak out about her being unwed and pregnant. Long story short they end up falling in love depsite the family hatred toward him and in the end he becomes a true asset to the fmaily.|`|HaEsRdC0aa	Fireproof.|`|lckv4hs3aa	how about Just Friends lol? Seriously|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	fireproof. it is so romantic and funny. it's a christain movie. i highly recommend it. it's about this couple and a girl wants to get a divorce and the husband doesn't want to. it's the best!|`|UySiU0LSaa	Titanic. Its sooo romantic. I love it!|`|ark4Psqjaa	defiance it is about Jew's partisans true story and good movie|`|uIlmjJjhaa	The notebook, itll have them eatin out of the palms of your hand.|`|hN2j60pgaa	the notebook|`|PROxs7qJaa	She's Just Not That Into You.

This is a good movie, but there are some scenes with a lot of people being shot and blown up.  I wouldn't recommend it for this.
1Lm2Lfucaa	Dont go into debt over a wedding.  i would personally cancel it.  i just cancelled  mine because i can't afford it, and i can't see spending thousands of dollars for everyone else to eat and drink at my expense, when i can be using the money towards paying off my educational loans.  maybe i am overly pragmatic, but thats my point of view.  i am going to elope instead.    In times of financial distress, it is imperitive to separate wants and needs.  a wedding is big, expensive, stressful want, not a need.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	Borrough money from your friends, cousins whatever..|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	first of all, sit down and read all the contracts carefully  for anything you have  booked.  find out how much money you would loose if you canceled.  if you cant afford to outright  cancel it, see how much you can  downsize or make yourself.  like, if the flower person will allow you negotiate, take one or two flowers out of every boquet and centerpiece.  if your getting charged per stem, that can save you a lot.  skip things like favors.  lots of people waste money on wedding favors that will not ever get used, so why spend the money?  look at every little detail in the contract and see what you can afford to skip out on.        to save more, look at your life outside the wedding. its gonna suck for a while but cut down on any eating out you do.  clip coupons for anything you buy on a regular basis.  avoid buying anything you dont NEED to live.  consider buying non name brand stuff for a while if you can.  buying store  brand stuff can really add up to some good savings.      ummmmmmm......is your fiance getting unemployment?  if he isnt, ANY job he takes right now will be an improvement, even if its just for a while.        i hope i helped in any way.  i am in roughly the same situation as you, and its hard, and scary.  best of luck hun, i really hope the best for you guys|`|2rsiKfj7aa	Take out a loan! I hate to hear that! Good luck|`|HQsmRzPsaa	see if your parents are will to pay for te whole thing up front and you will pay them back for half, or take out a personal loan|`|IxoazyHUaa	You may be out your deposits, but I would cancel the big wedding and just have a small ceremony and dinner for immediate family only and call it a day.|`|xRJQSNJeaa	I hate to tell you this and it's sad to hear it but in theory you can't cancel the wedding sweetheart. Since the vendors already have the deposit if you canceled now or even moved the dates around if you canceled the vendors wouldn't give you your money back and I think if you switched dates you'd have to pay a deposit again not sure though. But heres what I suggest either get a loan and pay it back after get a credit card I hate to say that or if possible is there anyway that   you can cut down costs in some areas of your wedding I hope this helps and I'm so sorry|`|em0VhxyOaa	i would put it off and wait till u have the money or re think the weeding plans|`|CYjrHrmAaa	Is your half of the wedding more than the money you'd lose if you canceled it? (like any deposits, money you spent on invitations and what not). Some deposits are not refundable or you only get part of the deposit back, so take that into consideration.|`|Qi00wt3Taa	Take a look at your budget and see what you can cut.  Also start calling your booked vendors and see if you can get any of your deposit back or see if some of your deposits were small enough that you feel ok cancelling that vendor.  You really do not need favors, programs, or any other kitschy things like monogrammed matchbooks or napkins.  Save on your cake by using sheet cakes and make sure that you're being charged per cake and not by slice.  Order flowers from fiftyflowers.com and make simple garden style floral centerpieces.  Only a few stems are needed for each one and you can make your budget go further by getting inexpensive greenery to go in them.  Small hand tied bouquets are also easy to DIY.  Check out Craig's list for used wedding dresses or go for something a non traditional dress at J.Crew or a department store.  You can find a beautiful white dress for a couple hundred bucks.  You can make less expensive menu choices such as Mexican or Italian buffets or even do heavy appetizers only.  A morning wedding with a brunch will also be a less expensive meal.  You do not need to have champagne for all and can toast using Sparkling cider or whatever everyone is already drinking.  Have a friend take tons of pictures.  You can make a nice album later using snap-fish or another site.  Do your own hair and makeup, you can make your own veil.  Keep things simple and personal and the day will be beautiful.  Everyone will be excited to share it with you no matter what amount of money is spent on it.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	do what we did we got married by the county clerk then we had a nice cookout at a friends house.     you can cut down your list and just have a few friends and family members and have a small reception at a nice restaurant .  or you can just get married at the court house and go somewhere for dinner with who ever stand up for you and have the parents there. you can have a party later that way you can have a small honeymoon over the weekend|`|8xDOEr63aa	Don't cancel.    Sit down with your fiance and begin prioritizing what is most important to you as far as vendors and what you are contracted for.    You may need to cancel certain services or settle on more basic offerings that cost less. Talk to your vendors about you situation and see what they can do to help cut costs. Do you really need to pay a cake cutting fee?    If the two of you were contributing equally and one of you lost your income then all you are needing to replace is 25 percent of the cost. Cancel, pare back, have a yard sale, put stuff of craigslist neither of you use anymore, ebay... get creative!     You can still have your wedding. It's worth trying the best you can, because this is a huge moment in your lives. Plus, you two sharing in this effort will build very solid skills that will be called upon many times throughout your married life.    Try to go through with it. Don't take out loans from a bank or family under any circumstance either.|`|r5AbT6tmaa	Forget the wedding. Get married in a simple ceremony. Have a nice dinner with family to celebrate.
tmeo3diUaa	Don't push him he's not ready     Tell him you will wait for him while he goes out and sows his wild oats, tell him to screw every woman he wants so he gets it out of his system that way when he marrys you (if he comes back) he will be content with just your vagina.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Yeah it would. There must be a nicer, gentler way to let him know that you want the relationship to move forward. You know, something that doesn't involve giving him a deadline. That could end up hurting much more than it helps.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I say that if he is you are good enough for him to sleep with every night then you are good enough to marry. tell him you want some kind of commitment or then he has to move out and then you will still date him. why live like you are married and he not want it?|`|w1necKzYaa	I don't think it would be selfish tell him you are not going to wait forever! but be prepared in case he deciedes to go the other way!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Are you for real?? You've been with this guy for 5 YEARS!!!!!! he's avoiding marriage. It's just that plain and simple. Give him an ultimatum and see what he does. If he doesn't want to get married, then I suggest that you suggest to him that it's OVER???? I don't blame you one bit. Trust me>>He's just avoiding marriage. I have to say that magic 8 ball hit the nail right on the head with this one!! You've made it too easy for him to where he feels like why should he get married??? he has everything he wants right there without and marital commitment??? Give him the ULTIMATUM!!!!!!!  See what happens. Tell him if he doesn't want to get married, then you need to move on with your life and find someone else to settle down with??? TRY IT!!! believe me>>>he'll give in if he knows you won't be around????  THAT A GIRL HOWDYS GIRL!!!!!!!! works everytime! But you need to be sincere about it. Don't say it if your not going to do it!!! DO IT!!!!!!  OH GEEZ?? I wonder who gave me the three thumbs down?? Couldn't be MEN could it. They HATE it when they get FIGURED OUT??? But then again>>their easy creatures to do that to. LOL|`|HtHFHfDKaa	The first thing you did wrong was letting him move in with you. If you are already engaging in intercourse with him then no wonder he doesn't feel the need to get married there really isn't much mystery left that is why he isn't rushing to get married.  You can try giving him the ultimatum but it might not do any good it's not selfish or hasty he just doesn't see the need since you two are already living together. It is supposed to be get married then move in together.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Try this.. say  I'm 29 now and I'd like to be married to you before I'm 30 because I want to start a family.  If this isn't something you want to do, then please tell me by Easter.  That way I'll know we don't' share the same goals and I'll move out and find someone who I'm compatible with. I love you and hope we will be together, but marriage is important to me and I'd like to have a ring and a date set so I can continue to move forward with my life"    Then stop talking and drop the subject.  If by Easter you have no resolution, back your things and move. Don't keep playing pretend wife.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I think that your ultimatum will blow up in your face.    I will never understand why people that want to get married move in together and start a life as man and wife without a ring on their finger--at least an engagement ring.  You have made it very easy for him to have it all without the marriage.  Don't expect it to change.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Do not give him an ultimatum.  You will regret it.    Just let him know that you are going to be moving out as it seems that you are both on different pages regarding the future, but then my friend you must go thru with it....move into your own place.  If he comes running then great!  If not, you move on.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	For me at least, marriage / engagement is a symbol to the outside world of your commitment. You mention that you need that commitment. That does not sound like a good sign. An ultimatum would be a horrible idea - he says yes and forever you married because you made him - is that the best case or worst case.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	why should he get married?  He's been "playing house" for the past two years.  You mean to tell me that after 6 years; through the emotional roller coaster of college; and the stress of employment; he hasn't decided if he wants you to be his wife?  Sure, that's reasonable. Not!    I know only old people speak in anecdotes, but does the phrase that mentions a cow and not having to buy milk have any meaning?|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I've seen this question a hundred times, but yours has a twist I've never seen before: your bf told you how to get him to ask you to marry him.  What, you didn't notice?  Sure - it's where you wrote, "no need to rush anything because we already live together."      Clearly, then, the solution is to move out.    I'm serious.  And this is exactly the same answer I always give to young women, even when their boyfriends have not been kind enough to tell them the solution.  Tell him you need to step back to consider where your relationship with him is heading, and that, in order to do this, you need some space to really think things through.  So, you're moving out.  And that is all he needs to know.    When you move out, also stop having sex, again telling him that you're thinking hard about your relationship, and that sex only clouds your mind, so no sex for now.    One of two things will happen.  He might decide to call your relationship quits, but if he does, it means your marriage would have sucked anyway.  Or, he will come to you, get down on one knee, and offer you an engagement ring.    I think you should try it.|`|GmTMVmASaa	no you are not being selfish,  most women desire that. 29 is young, but i understand you don't want to wait forever for the children.plus also as you get older, the children get faster and it aint so easy running after them.jk. anyway, some men do that extra push.|`|AA10748233	6 years? What the hell is he waiting for? A sign from god? When my husband and I first got together, we agreed that we would wait 5 years, and if we could still tolerate each other after that, we would get married. He's had plenty of time to decide if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you or not. Y'all aren't getting any younger, and if you want to have a family, you'd better get cracking! Besides, an engagement doesn't mean you have to be married immediately. You guys could be engaged for a year or two before having a wedding, and knowing he's interested and willing to commit means everything. Sounds to me like he's afraid of something. I don't know if backing him in to a corner with an ultimatum is the solution, but you should certainly communicate your feelings about what you want for your future. If he doesn't want the same things, maybe it's time to move on. And maybe if he's loses you for a while, he'll realize how much you mean to him, and reconsider. Good luck!|`|AA11138696	If he is not ready after 6 years he will never be ready but he has a point, what is the point after 6 years.  I am afraid that you must be prepared to move on without him.  Your only option is the ultimatum marry me or else but you must be prepared to go through with the or else part or it means nothing at all.  so  how far are you willing to take this?|`|03llfXdpaa	If you've been together for 6 years then why would he not be ready? Either he doesn't want to get married or he doesn't want to get married to you. If that's the case then you need to move on and find someone who is not going to take years to figure out if your're the one or not.|`|TDWcZ1Sbaa	If marriage is something you truly want to accomplish then yes an ultimatum.  But if you love this man and you could be happy with only living with him then I wouldn't push it.  But it sounds like this is something you truly want so my advice is put your foot down.  Tell him what's what.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	I wouldn't insist on a time or date.  But you should lay it down.      Just say - Honey, if we aren't going anywhere soon, I want you to know that my clock is ticking and I won't stay like this forever.  I will eventually walk away from us if we aren't moving towards a more permanent arrangement.  Not a warning..it's just a fact.  I don't want to leave.  I don't want to lose you..but I don't want to be single all my life.|`|11qdMtlGaa	I don't think it is nasty or selfish you have a goal in life and you want to accomplish it.  If he doesn't have the same goals maybe you should think about that.  Maybe you should ask him if he ever wants to get married and have kids.  If the answer is yes than you know it will come sooner or later but if the answer is no than maybe you should think about who you are with.  Also why does he have to ask you why can't you ask him?|`|1Lm2Lfucaa	I think if you do the ultimatum, you will get your answer.  i agree with the person with the first answer in that if he can't see that he wants to marry you by now, he is never going to see it.  if marriage is one of your goals, then you should do what you can to achieve it.  it doesn't look like staying with him will allow you to achieve it.  maybe he is stringing you along.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Be frank with him - tell him it's do or die time...set your own time limit (keep it to yourself!) and start planning for the worst (save money in case you need to get your own place, etc.).  Hopefully he'll pull it together and you can use your money towards a wedding...but, if things don't work out - at least you are prepared.|`|Rl2VamIRaa	if you do this please be ready to lose him he may not be ready and if he isnt and you are then maybe its time to think about letting go...|`|bKK2fPiVaa	YOU SOUND LIKE ME!  Sounds exactly like what I went through.  Here's what I did:  I wasted a lot of time nagging and crying about it.  That never worked and I felt so hurt and used.  We loved each other and had so much fun together but we had been together for a long time.  He just wasn't "ready"... whatever that means.  After several years, I finally gave him an ultimatum.  A time frame. Not to pressure him, but to make sure I wasn't wasting MY time.  I loved him, but if he didn't feel the same way I felt, then I was done.  To say the least, he proposed a few months later, we got married 5 months after that and life has been wonderful.  All that pre-marriage pressure is GONE!|`|7IszrvmWaa	y  don,t you ask him to married and be the agreser that way you do no have to give an ultimatum|`|yd2SP7d6aa	He says he's not ready, no need to rush anything because we already live together.  What is the saying, why buy the cow when the milk is free.      At any rate, there is nothing wrong in asking for what you want and moving on if the person you are with is unable / unwilling to provide it.  It's not like you are already married and have made a committment (your just boyfriend / girlfriend, which is the point of dating).  If you don't have a time frame in situations like this and you follow the instructions of people that say "just wait", well before you know it your 40 years old, you have no marriage, and if you do have kids they are out of wedlock.    The only thing I would warn is that you have to be prepared for the "bad" in ultimatums, namely he will say "see ya, I'm not getting married".  The good thing is you will now know and in the future you can date men that aren't just looking for a "friend" but a wife.|`|xGshAiXOaa	How can you love him, if you're just as ready to marry him as you are to leave him?|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Don't use an ultimatum to test him.  Only say it if you really mean it.  Games really damage a relationship.  Having said that, don't wait forever and miss out on having a family.  The idea that it is easy to get pregnant and have babies in your late thirties is a total myth.  It works for some women, but your odds go down every year after 30 and by 35 most women start to have real problems.|`|b072771e0ce9d50e2eb422756b55e11eaa	Cut your losses, he will never change - you just want different things.
uBssj3Znaa	because he just wanted to have sex with you and once he gets it he starts a fight so that you two don't have to talk to each other for a while ... at least until he is horny again.|`|ax6cjSn6aa	okay you shouldn't make love with him because most males just want sex it hurts the girls i think. i wouldn't do it again. that's why im waiting for a special one.|`|71yXXY3eaa	Leave him and never have sex with him again.  You should not be having sex unless you are married and have a firm and committed relationship with the man you love.  If you are not satisfied with the way things are going it would strongly behoove you to leave this man and find a new one to marry so that you can have a happier life.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	He's keeping you away.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Try asking him.    You are giving him what he wants with no strings attached. Why does he need to respect you ? You always come back for more.|`|ks2oieV0aa	He doesn't want to commit!  He clearly is just in it for the sex.  xox|`|nrnVqh7iaa	After you milk the cow, you don't want it hanging around the barn.|`|435c271Kaa	He is probably afraid of commitment. If he hasn't settled down with you by now, he most likely isn't going to.|`|GzL8X6vTaa	If he can't act right or treat you right then stop having sex with him.    Remember great sex doesn't equal love.|`|GBZQP5pAaa	Maybe he feels superior to you and does that to make himself feel better. Nevertheless, it's still wrong. I wouldn't expect any kind of emotional relationship with this guy, and honestly would not even have a "physical relationship" either. Your choice though.|`|nWGgaQdhaa	sounds like he's afraid of commitment, heres an ides. refuse to do anything with him awile, say a couple weeks, then tell him that you want him, (and he should be dying for you) and see what happens, then if he hasn't changed try talking to him, or do it in reverse.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	cut him off from sex|`|2AoNw9Omaa	maby his life is unstable and that is how he takes it off his shoulders.|`|XC20JjzVaa	HAHAHAHA Will S.    anyway the guy sounds like an a$$hole.  id break it off.|`|b2mp5C9oaa	duh!|`|TckkApupaa	because he's a jerk who is treating you like dirt|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	Maybe it's just great to you! He may just come around when he can't find no strange...|`|6MtQIZaTaa	it sounds like he is just confused about how he feels. or maybe your right and he doesn't want to get to close. although sex is getting pretty close. try talking to him about it!     best of luck!|`|cGlVzud8aa	some guys just like to fight, my guy picks fights with me and wrestles me around cause that's his turn on. if its not your thing then maybe its time to find someone new|`|4tDTQOgNaa	Well that might be the answer. If for years yall have been having sex or what not thats probably as close as yall are going to get. Thats his answer to you, that he was never really up for a relationship or wanting to fall in love.|`|mcywqcHuaa	next time he starts a fight, distract him by giving him a *******|`|b3Wtnkjkaa	maybe it wasnt as great as you thought .|`|VCRP9efqaa	you should act like you dont wanna fall in love with him.  after great sex. you should just leave like you dont even care.  leave like he never pleasured you at all.  he'll come running back to you garentee.|`|omq3X7wgaa	first of all its why DOES he pick a fight, not why do he.....  maybe your grammar bothers him OR your just a booty call and if you dont want to be treated like dirt then stop acting like a hoe|`|6f5c461596d36223a4de1ff50d1fe3c1aa	You're just a sex thing to him.

Unless you did something really unforgivable that the family hasn't forgotten about. Then just stay where you are you are happy where you are aren't you?
y6gVmhHxaa	My husbands bachelor party was a day of paintball then all they guys went back to one of the guys house and played beer pong.  He had a great time.  It depends on what the guy is into, if he likes going out plan a bar crawl, you can really do anything.|`|0Id85yiYaa	that's a pretty broad question not knowing where you're located or what the groom's interests are. here are some suggestions:  - go on a weekend ski/beach trip  - golf  - bar hopping  - sporting even  - fishing (charter a boat)|`|3MDY29gnaa	A bachelor party is about one person: the groom-to-be. This is his opportunity to enjoy activities celebrating his impending nuptials with his groomsmen and friends without the watchful eye of wives, girlfriends, and the bride-to-be. Because of this, most bachelor parties revolve around male-dominated activities that women arent usually interested in joining. The key to a successful bachelor party is to determine what the groom-to-be enjoys, and catering to those interests by celebrating him.     Creative bachelor party ideas include:     Poker Night: Themed accessories can create an entire poker party venue, and watching poker championships while playing with friends can be a great way to relax at home.    Playing golf.Casino Trip: Traveling to a casino can be a long bachelor party weekend including different gambling activities, good food, and other entertainment.   Sporting Events: A skybox or suite is a great location for a sports-themed bachelor party, complete with catered food, excellent views, and other spectacular service.   Movie Night: Guy-favorites such as the Matrix, Die Hard, and other action movies can be the focal point of a cinematic bachelor party, including nachos, pizza, and other movie snacks.   Homecare Party: While it may not seem like much fun, gathering all the groomsmen together to help with lawn care, washing the car, and doing minor home repairs can not only be an opportunity for horseplay and casual fun, but its a great help to the groom-to-be to have these chores taken care of before the wedding.   Sportsmen Event: Whether its a day of fishing on a nearby lake or hunting in the backcountry, enjoying sportsmen activities together is a great way for the male members of the wedding party and close friends to bond before the big day.   Playing Sports: A touch-football game, round of golf, pool tournament, paintball challenge, or day at a baseball training camp can help work off nervous energy and enjoy good friends for the soon-to-be non-bachelor.   Food Party: A beer-and-bratwurst party, chili cook-off, or ultimate barbeque feast is a great way to indulge in delicious food and celebrate the groom-to-be with his favorite foods.

Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	tradition says they pay for the rehearsal and honeymoon, maybe limos but that's all the groom's side does.  it's a shame they're unwilling to chip in more just because of their opinion that it's a waste of money.  yes, it is a waste of money to spend four figures or more on a party that lasts all of 5 hours but you suck it up and pay it anyway so your kids are happy for one lousy day of their lives.|`|4POGapREaa	I'm not a kid so mommy & daddy didn't have to pay.  My husband & I paid for it.  I think it's absolutely ridiculous to put your mother in this position.  You want to focus on what HIS parents AREN'T doing, but what about what you're expecting from your mother?  She has to dig into retirement accounts to pull this off?  And you don't care about that?  So, your mom is paying for most of it, your fiance's parents are paying for the flowers & photographer, your fiance is paying for the honeymoon, and what are YOU paying for?  I'm so sick & tired of this spoiled brat syndrome, I can't even tell you.  You're starting off your married life doing things that you can't afford to do.  Will you be able to pay rent, gas, water, electric, car payments, insurance, cell phones, food, and other necessities by yourself?  You should elope since your fiance has the honeymoon covered already.  Just get married by yourselves wherever you're honeymooning & save other people having to dip into their accounts for you to be happy.  Seriously.  I mean seriously.  Think about that.|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	it's not like the olden days where the Bride's parents pay...it is a joint kitty & everyone should chip in.    i would have gone abroad & got married on a romantic sunshine beach if that was me....that would teach his parents not to be SO mean!!  take your mum with you too as a witness....saves all the fuss & expense here!!|`|AA11366224	Traditionally, the bride's parents pay for the wedding and the groom's parents pay for the honeymoon.  Perhaps you should tell them.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I would feel really bad if my mother was dipping into her investments to pay for my wedding, but that's just me.     No one is required to pay for anything for your wedding. Consider yourself lucky that you have help and move on. My fiance and I are paying for our wedding by ourselves. We've decided to have a long engagement simply so we can save up.|`|TjNMabEIaa	To start with, a wedding costs as much as you want it to.  There cannot be an `average` in the real world when you also have to include the millions celebs pay for their weddings.  Mine cost less then 3K and was everything I wanted...to get married to my husband, a reception and evening disco with buffet with all our friend and relations.  You don`t have to pay 10K, just be creative with where you buy things from.  I would definitely be worried if my parents had paid for it, in actual fact, we paid for our own and we paid what we could afford.  The honeymoon is a time for you to get away from everyone and be together...this could be in the next town or the other side of the world.  Again you book what you can afford or what your consience lets you.    It is traditional for the brides parents to pay for the wedding.  It is usual for the parents of the groom (these days) to offer a contribution, but this is not traditional and you cannot expect this to happen.  You are both doing your best to help your mum out by paying for what you can, and this is more than some children do. You should be proud of yourselves.    One word of advice though.  My parents and sister fell out in a big way over her wedding as they paid for everything and his parents paid nothing.  You need to persuade you mum that this is not the end of the world and to forget about his parents not sharing the burden of the bills for the wedding...It will only sour the day for you all to think negatively about his folks.  Try to put it to the backs of your mind and remember what this is about.  Two people in love wanting to get married, not about the money and who paid for what.    Good luck and I hope it works out for you.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	In this day and age - both parents should offer to contribute, as well as the young couple paying for it themselves. In truth, most couples dont get parental help nowdays, but when parents are in a position to do so - they often offer.   I think she is more worried cause it seems she is being allowed to cash in her investments - investments she has saved a long time to obtain and maintain and to give her a better life when she's older. And she'd do it for you as you can see. But when someone just as capable stands there like a cooked chook and CHOOSES not to contribute as well when its for their child as well. Then, I do get what she's thinking.   You should ask the parents to contribute equal amounts, and if they want to contribute more, they can do so secretly.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	My husband and I paid for our own wedding.  Total cost, including wedding rings, was just over $1,000.  My opinion is that way too much money is spent on weddings all the time.  We just wanted to get married, not have an over-the-top party like everyone seems to want.  There are much better things to spend ones money on, say, living expenses for your mother!|`|ARAYm7BLaa	your poor mother...why are you burdening her with a wedding that she can't afford, have a cheaper do...or pay for it yourself...at this rate you'll have fallen out with your H2B and his family long before the wedding.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Tradition has it that the bride's parents pay. Realistically, that is no longer practical or viable.  Fact of the matter is, if you and H2B scaled down what you expect your wedding to be lots of money could be saved.|`|df7e0a98adad7376c2265d7ad4d45e2faa	It's YOUR wedding, YOU pay for it. You shouldn't expect anyone, including your mum, to pay for it. If you can't afford it have a smaller wedding. You shouldn't be judging or criticising your in-laws because they are not contributing to YOUR wedding. Your poor mum needs HER money for her retirement, why are you fleecing her.  The sheer self-absorption you are displaying here is stunning.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	When we got married we paid it all ourselves and kept everything simple    My mum was a widow an my husbands dad didn't earn much    Both lone parents gave us money which we use towards furniture for our new home    I know you won't like me telling you this,   but all of this should have been discussed   before anything was booked   so that you both know exactly what your budget is|`|oXfvBdNHaa	Your mom has no reason to be mad. It seems like you are traditional, so it is more on your mom. And even then, your mom is not obligated to pay. Traditionally, the brides parents pay for everything except alcahol, rehersal dinner, and groomsmens tuxes.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	These days the bride and groom are expected to pay for the wedding themselves and not rely on their parents for more than they want to provide.  If you can't afford the wedding you want, then keep it simpler.  There are always ways to cut costs.     I don't know what the conversion rate from pounds to dollars is, but here in the US, the average wedding is $20,000 to $30,000, and we were able to have a nice simple, wedding for only $3,500.  Most of our friends and family have had weddings for less than that even, and many of them could afford much more but didn't want to throw their money away on a wedding.   People have a right to do what they want with their own money, and if they don't think spending it on a wedding is worth it, then it's not your place to demand it.     Also, if your husband's family is used to simpler weddings, than giving the amount of money they already have may feel like a huge contribution to them.  I don't think it's your place to judge.  My husband's mom only gave us $500 for our wedding, and didn't help with any of the planning, but we were grateful for what we received.  I didn't even have my mom helping me with the wedding either, so I had to take care of things by myself while working full-time at a new job.  You already have a lot more help than many brides receive.|`|NTK4XLuDaa	My wedding cost 720 inc rings and honey moon 4 years ago. I agree with his parents that it is a waste of money.

I know she wants to-but this is her retirement fund. Your H2B's parents are under no obligation to help pay for this, and they are being very wise. They are doing the most loving thing that they can for you and your H2B-they are making sure that they can provide finacially for themselves, now and in the future, and not paying for something outside of their means.     When you continually make a habit of living outside of your means, you end up reliant on OTHERS in your old age.     The 5-6000 pounds your Mum gives to you today could make the difference of her moving into your home a year or two earlier than necessity would require in twenty or thirty years.     Out of your love for her-pay for this wedding yourself. Have a wedding that YOU and H2B can afford.And be thankful that your H2B was raised by such intelligent people-this can only bode well for your financial future.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Traditionally the Bride's parents pay for the wedding except:    1) Honeymoon should be paid for by the Husband to be  2) Bridesmaid / flower girl dresses etc should be paid for the by Bridesmaid / flower girl family    Nowadays with the cost of things and families being as they are, the couples pay for things themselves and may get help from the parents.      By the way, I paid for my bridesmaid's dress as I felt it was wrong expecting her to pay when she was doing me the honour.|`|F8iYNurEaa	I think that the tradition that the brides parents pay for the wedding is outdated these days. This is because nowadays weddings cost so much. It was fine during the days when a wedding cost the equivalent of 500 but these days it is unfair to expect people to get into massive debt for ONE day. It is fine if your parents offer and can afford to pay for the entire thing, but in many cases it is not realistic to expect this.     I am getting married next year and I told my fiance after he proposed that I would be paying for my half of the wedding. He or his parents can pay for the other half (it didn't sound as brutal or stroppy as this when I told him....lol). Like your mum, my mum is also by herself. I would never ask her for money for my wedding as I do not want to make her financially unstable for the sake of a glorified party. My mum has offered us some money, and his parents have offered us the equivalent. Me and my fiance will save the rest ourselves. Both sides are happy with this arrangement. I think it is sad that your fiances parents are not getting involved in your wedding plans and that they think it is a waste of money. I can understand why both your mum and youself are upset by this whole scenario.|`|9IRup1jHaa	Traditionally it falls to the brides parents to pay me and my boyf are paying for the majority of ours and as we have done so we have asked our parents to chip in forgoing wedding presents!

To prevent this, get a better job, have both parties go to work, and stop eating out three times a week.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	I would set up a budge and set up and emergency account. Also, avoid credit cards at ALL costs! No matter how much people tell you that it's okay to have one, it really isn't. It is very hard to keep that credit card in check. Also, if you haven't already, I would try to stay out of owning a home with the market how it is. Also, again, if you haven't already, hold off on having children until you have stable jobs and home. Budget and common sense is the main thing to do. Try to limit on extra spending (like going out for food or fun) until maybe the end of the week or month. Save up for that time out but get what you need to have done, done. If you have money left over, then you can go out. You could also talk to some free advisers about budget planning.|`|K2QwEM4raa	The only thing I can say is that it is horrible. I think it is a slow death been there.

Your affairs are not just about you, they are a direct result of you failing at your marriage and thus a complete blow to your wife's confidence.  The fact that you do not give her the decency to stay faithful and be honest with her makes her feel like a piece of crap.  So she is faced with 2 decisions, either stay with you and have absolutely no respect for herself or divorce you.  Divorce is hard, and its heartbreaking when you know that the man you married does not even care about the honesty you deserve and chooses to have an affair multiple times.<br>  <br>  Seriously buddy... you are a selfish jerk.  I hope you wake up one day and realize that this world does not revolve around you.  What you do and the actions you take have an effect on the people that do actually love you.  Your wife loves you... and you chose to treat her like a piece of meat and cheat on her multiple times.  Her self-esteem has shrunk down to a tiny grain... its hard to get on your feet after someone has treated you so badly.  Your a jerk!!!!|`|OG4410bdaa	could be alot of reasons...<br>  <br>  - could be that she loves you dispite your disrespect for her and the marriage<br>  - could be that she doesn't want to loose the life you've bulit together, especially if you have a house or children<br>  - could be that she has some misguided belief that she can change you when you obviously have no interest in changing<br>  - could be that she doesn't care about the affairs, some women don't<br>  - could be that she feels it is her fault you cheat, and she feels she deserves the hurt you put her through<br>  - could be that she is afraid<br>  (afraid of being single, afraid of being alone, afraid that no one will want her, afraid that you're the best she can get, afraid of change in general...)<br>  <br>  why don't you try asking her why she puts up with your bad behavior?|`|4fCjH7iWaa	Honestly, some women can forgive, some women won't divorce to spite the "other" woman, some women are in it for the kids, or the money and the house, some women are afraid of life alone, some women are glad to have that aspect of marraige taken care of by someone else. Which category does your wife fit into?|`|7df573746dd6a85c2a8f383acdd3aefbaa	I have no idea.<br>  She might be scared because it'll ruin your relationship or that you may get everything including the house or kids ( if you have any ).<br>  <br>  Or maybe she's having money problems.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out :)<br>  <br>  ~Megan|`|l1KlZrAOaa	She probably hasn't figured out that she DOES have other options other than staying with a loser like you.

In my own opinion I don’t think either of you are really meant to be together because once you find that person that you want to be with you can’t bring yourself to cheat on that person.  I’m not going to judge you for your affairs.  You can love someone but not be IN love with someone and there is a big difference.  I think you love her but your definitely not in love with her or cheating would hurt you worse that her!  She I am sure loves you a lot but I think that she may even herself be confused about it.  When you love someone or something you just want them to be happy regardless of what it takes.  When a woman finds out that her spouse is cheating sometimes that begins to break down her self esteem.  She may think that sex with her isn’t as good, boobs aren’t big enough, booty not big enough, not kinky enough or pretty enough ETC.   I am sure that she is trying to figure out what these other women have that she doesn’t and comparing herself and her habits.  Going through that long enough may make her feel like she will never be able to get someone again.  Those situations are so horrible and it is so sad that so many women go through that phase when finding out their spouse is cheating.  I see a lot of women on here talking about how she should just get rid of your butt and so on and so forth but who are we to judge and who really knows what they would do unless they were in that situation.  Not to mention that we are all very different.  Are you the main financial support of the house?  She may also be scared of that too!  Nobody wants to be left in the cold with out help but sometimes we learn the best from those situations.  If she is religious she may not want to break those vows!  I have to commend you on being a great guy in the since that you actually care about her feelings and if she would need help or not.  Some guys don’t even care enough to get opinions on that!  You seem to know what you want and to me it seems very clear that you just haven’t found THE one yet and that you just are not ready for this kind of commitment right now.  In my opinion, if you really love her, I think you need to go ahead with a divorce if you know that you can not be faithful to her.  She may be devastated but that might be what she needs to get some of that self worth back in the end.  There may be a guy out there for her that is meant to be with her and faithful to her.  You may need to take that step for her and for you.  I wouldn’t suggest being mean about it though…I hate hearing about those nasty divorces.  Do you have kids with her?  If so make sure you will always be there for them in the end too!  You may want to go together and get counseling even if you know you want a divorce so that she has support emotionally and mentally through something like that.  I hope that I helped a little bit and my heart goes out to you both!  I wouldn’t recommend getting married again until your buddy down there only gets a stiffy for the one your IN love with too….You may think that’s impossible but she is out there and you will be remembering this message when you do meet her so I will go ahead and say “I told you so.” Now!  Feel free to email me if you have any questions?|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Sadly because she probably loves your sorry as*. Probably more than she loves herself because you don't stay with someone who constantly hurts you and could possibly endanger your health just because "you have a problem".

If she knows she is worth more than **** she'll probably get up the currage to leave you.<br>  <br>  Edit:  You should feel like crap.  Every day, then you might have a very small idea of how you've made your wife feel.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	She's afraid of being alone, can't support herself in the lifestyle in which she's currently living, or she's having an affair too and she doesn't mind that you are.

1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	First off, let me say that I am BY FAR the least jealous woman that God ran a gut through.  But another woman BLATANTLY staring at my man (which is what it sounds to me like you were obviously doing) will cause a couple of things to happen.  You admitted sitting close to them so that you could look at him.  That was your first mistake my friend.<br>  <br>  The first thing that would happen would be that I would remain calm and enjoy your little game (for a while).  (It would make for a great bedtime romp when my husband and I got home later that night though.)  Anyway, I would smile at you while you played this childish little game of yours.  After all, I'm a grown woman.  I've done the same thing and played the same game myself.  I know exactly what you were doing!  But you have to know if you're capable of backing your play or not.  You obviously weren't capable of doing that -- because you left.  But regardless, here's what would've happened with me.<br>  <br>  After a while, I would have excused myself to go to the restroom and while I was gone, my husband would have been given the chance to go and speak to you and perhaps buy you a drink or something.  That would be totally up to him.  If he refused, then I would expect him to convey some sort of a message to you through eye contact - or whatever other means necessary - that your game is now over.  Now, at this point, if your clever little a** chose not to forfeit the loss, then all bets are off -- and when I return -- I will take over.  <br>  <br>  When I return, if you should continue to act stupid, then that would be when I would have to step in and make my move on you.  I would go over to you and calmly explain to you that the fella that you have been flirting with is obviously taken and is not interested in you.  He was given an opportunity to pursue your game further....but I'm sorry to say.....he declined.  So at this point, I must tell you that if I see one more grin....one more side-ways-glance....one more toss of the hair....one more shift of the dress...one more flick of the tongue....or one more direct stare from you aimed in my husband's direction, I will proceed to stomp your a** right here in front of God and everybody and I promise you that I won't f*cking quit until the God-d*mned paramedics cart your trashy a** outta here on a God-d*mned gurney.  Now, honey, do we understand each other?  Your little game is over.  You lost. <br>  <br>  Then I would get up and ease my way back over to my husband so that we may finish our evening together.  What happens next would be totally up to you sweetie.|`|e52b24b36abfccc707d535ac5027e508aa	Women are already insecure enough about their boyfriends looking at other girls, even without you making eyes with them. Usually girls will use flirtatious eye contact as a way for a guy to notice them and talk to them. If you had a boyfriend and some chick was staring at him and he was looking back, can you honestly say that you wouldn't be jealous AT ALL? I personally don't think it's fair that you would do that. It's rude and insensitive.|`|h33po57Uaa	You did not do anything by looking at the boy..you looked but didn't touch. But she starting tripping once she saw him smiling back at you and the fact that he practically broke his neck to keep looking back at you, while he was in his girlfriends presence.. What she should have done was raise her voice at him instead of you. Me personally,I would have took you looking at my man as a compliment (like ooh her man is hot) But if the shoe was on the other foot would you have gotten mad too?

282957fb43771156426c9a69aa8e12f0aa	I guess you don't hang out with them because they don't stay close to your house. Its just normal. You stay in touch with a person who stays close more than who doesn't. If you want to hang out with other friends too then try to be in touch with them via phone or the Internet. Try to find interest in things which they find interesting and propose some plans for hanging out <br>  <br>  Even if this all fails, don't bother yourself Just enjoy every moment with the one friend whom you hang out with. <br>  <br>  CHEERS n DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY :)|`|vXa7IeDiaa	Just to let you know sometimes its good just to have one friend. out of a group of friends one of them is bound to be a fake friend.But i feel where you are coming from..Why don't you hang out with a group of friend with your best friend? just so you have like a buddy with you in the group..but do socialize with other ppl..Go out to a party.But just remember you don't have to do everything with your best friend.

I have one friend that i would ditch all just to hang out with and vice versa. However, its nice to meet other people so that you can express other aspects of your personality.

You can do this through a friend.|`|8YDQnUZPaa	seriously thats your fault if your shy and if she finds someone else thats your fault you shouldnt be shy if your really love her and you know that she is single buy her a rose on valentines and give to her and tell her you like her|`|bQcUvzZyaa	well just start talking to her or if you can text her or IM her on aim or something if being in person is hard. if u show her ur cool personality she will like you no matter what if ur cut hot or average or not attractive she should still fall for u if u try to hold a nice conversation and take risks in what you say dont be too self conscious. just be yourself and she might think its cute your shy.|`|YN9nRZQvaa	ummm ask your sister for help DUH!    give her a rose for V-day or like a teddy bear and be like "girl, I like you and want to get to know you! wanna go on a date with me?"

You just have to decide when and where you're going to do it.  Then man up and do it.  It's scary but totally worth it.|`|OURb1rnTaa	dude, if she's your friends sister, that's a good thing!  you've got a head start! get her some candy or a teddy bear and say "happy valentines day".|`|6H4QaYXXaa	get her some chocolates and say that you like her  see what happenss...|`|WbmWe4K8aa	look if she is ur friends sister than ask ur sister wuld she talk 2 her 4 u (tht always sumwat wurks) but u can giv her sum chocalate or stuffed animal .....|`|CK2itUN1aa	just go up to her and tell her and say look i know you know me but you don't know that i have this huge crush on you and i was hoping that maybe we could date but that's totally your choice if i don't reach your expectations as a bf i understand but i just couldn't keep it in my heart anymore.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	ask your friend to talk to her for you and for valentines day get her a box of chocolates or a stuffed animal just something sweet good luck =] x|`|8vfCRg7Caa	yours sister is the key, dont tell your sister you like her friend, but use your sister to figure the girl out and break the "creepy guy" ice..     Id say since its so close to valentines day and you dont have a lot of time. Work on trying to be her friend first. Just come up to her at lunch or something and sit with her and say can i sit her or such and such. Then say "my sister says alot of things about you" and start bring up certain things that would make her laugh.|`|AYodutzuaa	Tell your friends sister to explain to your crush that you like her and you want to go out. Give her a stuffed bear with a heart. Or a box of chocolates.|`|GF3rHIK7aa	Give her a rose and a stuffed animal. And be nice about it, don't have a friend give it to her, give it to her yourself and don't forget to SMILE :)|`|eMc9AOlAaa	if she is your sisters friend the first thing you should do is get on your sisters good side. Idk your sister but do something nice for her then when she is being really nice tell her you like her friend   See wat she ses then go from there|`|ss8oeIDyaa	You should bring up something you know she is interested in and then casually ask her out to a Valentines dinner. Since V-Day is so close flowers will do for a simple and telling gift.|`|2lSgdriKaa	My daughter really liked this boy in one of her classes and she is shy well anyways one day she got up the nerve to start a conversation with him. You know a real conversation not just a hi, bye kinda thing. Well anyways believe it or not the conversation started out with something as simple as they had similar tastes in gym shoes. Well the rest is history cause now they hang out and are starting to "see each other." She too was friends with his family so it was kinda hard.       If it's ment to be... it'll happen. Don't rush things.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Give her a card that says "Happy Valentines Day.  You are liked."
zarWdC6Taa	You sound awesome (:  And your defiantly cute. So no, your not ugly.  But beauty comes from the inside too, and it seems that you have both covered. :D    Oh yeah, and dont label yourself   labels are for soup cans not people ^_^|`|XkYhr4Vlaa	I think your hott....EmOish ....She will come along..dont worry....|`|6H4QaYXXaa	i wouldnt mind ;)  xxxxxxxx|`|KguUQ9WWaa	You're not ugly at all! Infact, a really good looking guy, you have great hair! Just because you're a virgin, doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Be proud! Most girls would KILL for a guy that is still a virgin, and that hasn't slept around with all the sluts. You'll gain respect for the simple fact that you clearly respect girls. I'd be happy to find a guy like you! Don't be pressured into anything, and save it for someone special. Good luck sweet :) xxx|`|xxiX1qQgaa	Well to tell you the truth youre a pretty boy, dont know why are you asking just wait for the right girl, and be an emo is nothing bad, always be yourself!|`|9GR84v2faa	I think you look cool dude. You might be emo but thats cool. She will come one day!.    Good luck!.|`|wsUXFeH2aa	You are actually really hot. And there's nothing wrong with being "emo", but I hate labeling people. I get labeled as "barbie", but Im so different. Im more "goth" on the inside. What im trying to say is that labels are wrong, because its unfair to judge someone when you just have your own unique style. Labels like "goth", "emo"...etc. generally have negative connotations and are associated with depression, darkness, death, and other stereotypes. That isn't fair though, because you are clearly a good, happy person. You are doing NOTHING wrong by being yourself. Actually, your strong enough to do  what most people in this world cant do. And your REALLY hot. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.|`|bRoSGSxLaa	you look realllly cute =]  not ugly at all!|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	just be more confident in yourself, you are really cute :)|`|6xHOa3tJaa	I thing your great and any girl would be very lucky I have to say you are the sexy man in the world damm fine as hell dont be hard on your self I would go with you in a heart beat  sexy man of the year  right here fine bye Aaron take care|`|5iGS8zPBaa	You sound like a cool guy, and yes your emo.

You have your own style and you know who you are so thats a plus. Maybe the girls your lookin at are just blind cause you seem to be a great guy.
XWc7JIW6aa	Well, its not yet too late. You can still tell her how you feel. Just talk to her. Maybe she likes you back. Don't worry about your "flirty" friend, he has a girlfriend and it's not right to be dating two people a time. Just tell him that you like the girl. Maybe he'd understand since he is your friend.|`|suKoM2owaa	you need to wake up those balls of yours and kick your slimy friend in the nards, then go chat up to the chick. dude, in 50 years or so we'll all be either old and ugly or dead, so what do you have to lose? just do it|`|og3Tmn0saa	Shy girls are nice because they are more likely to go out with you IF YOU ASK THEM AFTER THE SWIM MEET.  When she says yes, inform your friend to the bros before hos rule and tell him his flirtiness with her is up.|`|Mq27uY0Maa	Just forget all your fears she is only human she will talk to you..... just practice at home think about what you are going to say.... think of something funny or clever to start off with you can reverse alot in life it just takes time and the right approach
f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Not at all.<br>  He gets home and still the first thing he wants is to get it on.|`|vsSuEtG1aa	We are in the residential electrical field.  We haven't had much work for quite a while with the economy crisis going on.  It has affected our sex life, but for the better.  We only have each other right now and we are closer because of it.  In hard times, we seem to pull together and live on love as much as we can!|`|7cjqT33Baa	I don't understand the question?  Why would it be affected because he's in the construction field?|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Yes... he is very good with his hands;)<br>  <br>  and super tan in the summer... except for the super white butt.<br>  <br>  Yummy?|`|88bDvyiwaa	what does construction have to do with ejaculation?|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	I am not a wife or g/f, but I can say that construction work can be extremely physically demanding , plain and simple, too damn tired to want sex.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	yes you try doing that job on a daily basis and see how sexy you are
MqCuDV4Naa	VERY OK!|`|CzdxFiRLaa	Hi Girly,<br>  <br>  Of course it is ok... it is normal and a natural thing to do.  It is beautiful learning about your body sexually, you will feel more confident when you develop a relationship with someone special.  <br>  <br>  Also you find out what excites you and what doesn't, what is stimulating and a real turn on for you, and after a while you will discover those special things that give your wonderful climaxes.  <br>  <br>  Ignore those who say it is dirty, un-godly, sinful and other negative terms, they are either ignorant, anal or liars.<br>  <br>  Go for it and experiment.<br>  <br>  David
c5UAa65qaa	Not automatically, no.  They'd be able to file for a fiance or spouse visa and start the process of applying for citizenship from there, but it's a long, complicated process.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	nope.  If you stayed married for three years they will get to to petition for US citizenship.  Also, immigration will check on you periodically to make sure the marriage is legit.  Also if they person has deportation orders they will have to leave no matter that you get married.  <br>  <br>  Best just to move to their country with them.|`|OHfZFR31aa	No, and if you lived in another country, you could be married for 50 years  and she still wouldn't be eligible for US citizenship|`|a3c3392247d405058e0fabf6cb28ddc7aa	The answer is NO!. There is a time period imposed by the federal government and this way its not for profit or any odd reason other than love.|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	No|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Automatically? No. You have to go through the whole process to get this person naturalized. It takes several years before they can become a citizen (I think, it's 3 years before one can petition for citizenship if they're married to a citizen; 5 years if not married to a citizen).
fZCfJWpOaa	So she sleeps with a teddy bear...likes chocolates, mickey mouse, and soft toys.  So what?    I don't think there's anything wrong with that, unless she acts like a child.  I love chocolate and plush animals, and I think so do most women.  She's just a girl!|`|AA11289793	A lot of girls like those sorts of things, there's a girl I work with that's 22 and she love Disney and collects all that sort of thing. But it doesn't mean that she can't be as grown up as everyone else, because the girl I work with is a manager and she has her own house a long-term boyfriend. So I wouldn't worry about it...|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	well every girl loves soft toys at any age especially at 17 its because of your age|`|fh2E0UJmaa	what lol pfft no u should know its normal because uv been to high school before too alot of girls in my school carry around " i love elmo" bags etc etc and i know people who have alot more stuffed animals.    btw im 16     and dont u think ur a bit too old for her? if u find her immature maybe its just becuz ur too old. she just over 16 frankly id feel like a bit of a pedophile if i were u no offence lol.|`|7UVFSjFBaa	she's still 17...  she's not a real adult yet..  but i think you should kinda tell what you feel and stuff..  but say it kinda in a way that it won't break her hear..  if possible|`|cZNzMyVuaa	Buddy, that's pretty normal behaviour, for ALL girls, but especially a teenager.    I'm 30 and i still have half a dozen of my favourite childhood toys, one of which I keep on the bed. And yes, I hug it if I'm in bed alone. I've even caught my boyfriend hugging it!    You need to relax.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	ummmmmmm    hello, she's 17----she is still IMMATURE.    and     there's nothing wrong with that....  I'm 42, and still look at stuffed animals and CHOCOLATES---HELLO---yumm|`|Jdvr40Chaa	its fairly normal for a 17 year old girl to still have stuffed toys left over from childhood in her room.  if she still buys soft toys then maybe its a problem, but if they are just left from when she was younger and she hasnt gotten rid of them yet that is fine.  a girl your age probably would have gotten rid of most of them by now, your girlfriend will let go of them eventually, its not a creepy thing or a problem.|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	dude chill|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Well she is seventeen. I have a teddy bear that I've had since I was ten, and I like her to be in the same room as me. It's kind of like a girl thing especially at our age. Even my older sister who is a mother has he special teddies.   If she is not 'mature' enough for you, then don't force her to be. If you're not ready to accept her how she is at the moment then you're not ready for a commited relationship with her.   But interest's etc. don't make you mature, it is your attitude and reaction to life that does. I'm VERY mature and everyone such as teachers, employers etc. all say so, I'm great looking after kids etc. yet I like Miffy, I love rabbits, I love sweets and candy, and I sometimes even speak in a childish voice, but all my 20 year old fiance can say is that it's cute and he loves me for it. But I know in a few years I'll grow out of it (except for the candy and rabbits lol)  So just let her have fun whilst she is young and don't preasurise her okay?  Raych|`|tC6MG0nyaa	that is not very weird.. relax..|`|Ys10tX6Yaa	lool yeah im like that its just a girly thing if you really 'love' her then you could try at least to like her habit it makes her feel happy. when my boyfriend climbed in my room i slept with him then turned over an hugged my teddy bear aswell haha, sorry mate its a habit for girls to do these things. if you tell her this then she might try and be something shes not just to impress you that shes not so immature|`|R0U4qy6haa	as long as she is not having sex with the teddy bear and not you i would not worry too much|`|AG3dYL84aa	Mate sorry but you need to learn some things about women.  Every girl needs somebody.   Weather it's a girl, a young woman, or even an older woman.      The teddy bear is just a substitute.  Don't worry at all about it.  If things go really well with her then one day you'll notice the Teddy bear is in the corner.  Then you'll know you're the one she sleeps with even when you are not there.|`|5sCpMpbWaa	I think you should talk to her about this.|`|YgZDXDgFaa	She is 17, and there are a lot of girls like that.     You should like her for her, and if she likes teddy bears and chocolates then its part of her personality.    If she's your girlfriend, i would've thought you'd notice her level of maturity and if that really bugs you then i don't really know why you got into a relationship with her.     I don't think thats a big issue to be honest. That would be the lamest thing to break up with someone over.  "I think you're immature because you have a teddy on your bed and you like chocolate"    There are a lot of women who still like those things, even when they're way older.     I love being childish... i don't ever want to be so mature that i can't cuddle a teddy bear!! Or run around playing 'it' in the snow! haha|`|s63U2ccFaa	Just talk to her,if she gets angry of stressed then she isn't that much of a girlfriend is she.She will probably understand. :)

RvmYqQtRaa	Yes, I consider most of the people on this site my anonymous friends. Even though everything any of them say may be complete lies. I feel people must live in trust and honesty, or be controlled by fear.|`|JhvYXbMmaa	Of course =]  All you really know is what you think you know though, cuz you dont know that person that well. But its possible to fall in love with someone youve never met, definitely.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Yes... I had kinda "small" feelings for him and thought it'd be really nice to get to know him... i was 13 at the time and him, 19. (we were almost 14, 20) We stopped talking til about a year ago because dad would be real mean when he caught me talking to this boy... but we talked every day since we reconnected and we consider each other boyfriend/girlfriend, though we still havent met. We are meeting this summer. I'm almost 19 now, and he just turned 24. My parents know about it and are pretty cool with it. He lives in California while I live in Kansas.|`|HRXTcAxQaa	it is only superficial attraction if you like someone you see at the store every other day. you don't know them so you can't have any real feelings for them beside lust. And online relationships are not real, the only connection between you two is the cable that connects you to the internet.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	Yes, i was in a college class with this girl when I saw her across the room from me. Just the way that she conducts herself made me want to get to know her. She had class and pride and that pretty much just drew me in.    She had sex appeal but her personality drew me in FROM ACROSS the room.|`|HdDKwcg6aa	yes ofcourse why not like im dating someone from another county we never met we are going to meet soon|`|PrqfYO7Oaa	Yep, I sure have, not anymore though|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	Nope.  How can you have feelings for someone you've never met?  Maybe you have feelings for an image of what you think that person is like, but that's about it.  If this is some kind of online relationship, just remember that the only thing you know about that person is what they want you to know or think.
I13rHn1Waa	patch up|`|Bi51WJd7aa	Why would I be forgiving them if I'm the one who got drunk and swore at them? lol    JK, I think you just muddled your words up a bit.. That's a tough one because if someone gets drunk and swears at you, who's to say they won't do it again? But, I'm a true believer in giving someone another chance. I would forgive that person and give them an opportunity to redeem themselves. If they did it a second time, I'd dump their a**!!|`|19TSkwaKaa	Boot.    Not a nice thing to say!|`|8Xu0A70Saa	Give them the boot, once and for all.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	If this behavior occurs again (3-4 times) then the break up is the only way.

Depends|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	You can patch things up but you need to punish your partner in some way so they don't do that again.
diGsA3isaa	NO! you're not cheating and its completely wrong from him to make you think that. he doesnt sound like that great of a guy in some aspects. i would tell him what you want and dont want from him, set the guidelines|`|PCrh5bOMaa	No you havent done anything wrong. Sounds like this guy really likes you but doesnt have the confidence to ask you out yourself.  You arent a couple therefore you cando as you please.
K1TUT0mZaa	If the car is in your name make sure you have it.  If anything happens to it while he has it, it's still considered yours.  If you are going to let him have it you need to be sure it is all put in his name then.  I would think since you have your daughter then you should have the car.  Sounds like he's being very selfish and just taking whatever he wants, so just stand your ground and make sure you have what you need to provide for yourself and your daughter.  If nothing else tell him you need to sell the car and split the profit to each get your own vehicle, or work something out like that.|`|AA11587827	depends on why u guys seperated, whos fault was it, i think it may have been urs|`|K6vEbdqxaa	Legally, if the car is in your name, it is your car!

At least you still have your child.  Start afresh.  I wish you the best.|`|om89gdFIaa	PLEASE!!!!!  How on earth does someone decide that the light bulbs are theirs?  Get the car.  It's your name on the documents.  If it was a gift, it belongs to you, it is YOUR property.  So what if he "spent more money" on it than you.  A car has to be roadworthy; that costs money.  Would he have had your daughter being driven around in an unsafe vehicle?  He cleared the house!  Doesn't seem to me as if he had any concerns, whatsoever, as to how you and your daughter were going to live.  You DID lose everything.  Everything that is considered "normal" to everyday living!  Bill him for the taxi fares you have to pay every day.  I'll bet he'll soon see that it is going to cost him a darn sight more than he ever spent on the car!  Even without knowing him, (or you, come to that), there are several things I would like to say to your husband, and several names I would dearly like to call him, but I think I would probably be struck off this site!  Have a word with the police again about this matter.  I was under the impression that if something "legally" had your name on it, it was yours, and, if another person "takes" or "removes"  that item "without your consent or permission", then it is "theft".  And thieves get prosecuted!  Good Luck.

AA11331041	Married women are probably just as likely to have affairs as married men.  In any event, it's unrealistic for one party to a relationship (married or otherwise) to expect the other person not to care and to be hurt when the relationship ends.  I certainly would not put all the blame on the woman who gets hurt.  The only way an affair can last and be happy (or as happy as possible given the limitations) is for both parties to be honest with each other about it, and to be caring of each other.|`|AA12089968	THE MOVIE SCARED THE HELL OUT ME AND I'M A WOMAN. MAKES YOU THINK TWICE ABOUT A ONE NIGHT STAND FOR SURE...|`|AA10470974	i think a man does this because he is bored in his marriage/relationship and wants to try something new and he probably does like her and then the next thing you know he has gotten involved and doesnt know what to do,he was only thinking of himself and didnt think of his wife,kids or the woman he got involved with it is a very selfish act and when he gets caught of course its not his fault its the ladys because she came on to him and she made him feel good about himself please they have all kinds of excuses and alot of times thats what happens the man or woman does become obsessed with the other and it ends up in a mess and then the spouse finds out and it can end up fatal for someone in the end it happens all the time unfortunately that is why it is against the law its called adultrey i personally would never get involved with a married man because i wouldnt want that done to me i have been in past relationships where the man has cheated and it hurts and it is something that to me cant be forgiven

mzNLfY4Caa	 He's a grown man looking for a grown woman. Just be reasonable...|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	stay away from him.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	You are jailbate,hon, and you are going to   get him     arresated|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Who cares how you get over him, just do it.  He shouldn't have to go to jail and spend the rest of his life labeled as a sex offender because you "can't get over him".|`|zka26204aa	He is much to old and mature for you.  You need time to grow and mature.  Let it go for now.  A couple of years down the road, when you have gotten more life experience, you and he would have a better chance of making it.|`|c2a0BgWraa	Definitely been there.  I've always like older guys and had this problem in high school.    The most important thing is the fact that you are a minor and he is a adult. Legally that does not fly at all. For that reason alone, you two need to remain friends for another two years.    Also, you've got an eight year gap between the two of you. You are at totally different places in your life and can't possibly have a whole lot in common.    My advice is to stay friends with him...but don't let it become anything more than that.  Then when you are 18 (and if after that time frame you are still interested in him) go for it!!  |`|71921d2d1fa46204a573f51a100b63afaa	Age difference of 8 years isn't that big of a deal.  Go for it if you want, just be careful, often older guys use girls and then leave them.  Besides, you have years of life to play around, you really should find out what the world has to offer.|`|Uu8TpjD5aa	Yes, yes you do.|`|xkWacKXDaa	u r too young for him 1st of all, and 2nd u have such a long time to meet hundreds of guys.  u barelly started ur life.  don't u wanna c what the world has to offer for u?  there is so much out there!|`|7pMPFk2Taa	wait ten years. if you can stomach the age differance then, your meant to be and it wont be as sick|`|JXa1yaXraa	your too young for him , he would get in trouble for being any more than friends with you. Sorry but its the truth. get over him or just be happy with being friends.. maybe in 5 years when you are 21 and he's 29 than there won't be so much of an issue|`|GzzLOwbbaa	You got to get into it and go through it to reach the other side. I hope you got the messages between the lines. I would not have an age old answer as avoid him or concentrate else where.  If you really like him a lot and he is worth you then you get along with him. Take your relation to the extremes and you will yourself get to a position wherein you will be able to make decision if you should continue or move your way.|`|ZPDvY2FQaa	You need to grow up and move on and talk to guys in your high school, this is a MAN you are talking about...its so weird your like 4 years younger than me and ur man is 4 years older than my man, u really need to get a guy your age when I was 16 I dated a 17 year old and me and him are still together...think about it this way... when u were 4 years old this guy was 12 thats nasty!|`|PEPMYUPLaa	Well, it's really not the difference in age per se, it is the placement, and there is nothing at all that can be done about that except to let a few years pass so that the age difference is not such a big deal. Some of the folks seem to be on the right track though in that maturity and general life experience play a lot into whether or not you really have anything that will make it a relationship rather than an infatuation. At this point in your life, especially if it really hurts to hang on and suffer, you are best to let go so that you and he can move on and learn from this.    For what it's worth, at your age and definitely by mine, everyone has been in a situation where they are feeling the strong things that you are feeling. Really and truly, it happens to everyone eventually and we all get through it even though it seem to be a living hell at the time. Relationships come and go, and almost none of them are without some sort of painful experiences along the way even if they are generally great. Though you probably do not believe it now, in the end you will be fine and you will live to love another day.    Best luck!|`|8xbGfsn4aa	I swear to gosh it will go away as long as u try to find someone else|`|FSzViWKmaa	it realy doesnt matter when i was 16 i was dating with a guy 29 years old|`|LDBPIleaaa	Oh my gosh!

DlCcFu1eaa	Considering something like 90% of the people agreed with you I'd say you have little more to complain about than the "other woman" does when the guy returns to his wife. LOL. <br>  <br>  I also hate it when people assume things that I didn't say and go off on that assumption. Some people seem to just pick out a few key words and their brain locks up on some pet peeve of theirs. It's especially annoying when the question is short and to the point like your was. Sometimes when somebody has a rambling question, like my rambling answer here, I don't blame people for not reading it right.<br>  <br>  As long as we're griping about dumb $hit$ on YA, my present pet peeve is stupid people who shout their whole question or answer.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Perhaps because you came off as judgmental and condescending in the way you worded your question. I don't know if you meant for it to sound this way, but it did. I agree with you 100% that women who fool around with married men do so at their own risk, and have no one but themselves to blame when things don't work out. But I wouldn't generalize it to all "other women" - there are lots of different people, lots of different situations, lots of different attitudes. Just because *some* of the people act a certain way *some* of the time doesn't mean that *all* of them act this way *all* of the time. Your question was posed in a somewhat confrontational way, and you did elicit some confrontational responses. If you are offended by confrontational responses, perhaps it would make sense to use more neutral wording in your questions.|`|rawz0RJuaa	k i just read your other question. <br>  and yeah that is totally a legit question.<br>  the "other women" know that the man they are with has a wife. <br>  why would the man be loyal to them when he is not even loyal to the woman he pledged before God and legally to be loyal to!?<br>  haha the other women are the ignorant ones!<br>  why do women do this to other women is what the real question should be!<br>  if every woman would refuse to lead on emotionally or sexually any man who is married or with another woman in any way, even if they say "my marriage is over" then imagine how drastically this country's divorce rate would plummet! <br>  why do we insist on stabbing each other in the back?!?!|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	I understood it the first time & I was truly amazed how many peoples heads that just went right over.<br>  <br>  <br>  20 year olds...LOL...Tsk, Tsk, Tsk!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I'm sorry but the only question you asked is whether I can read. Yes dear I can do that quite well.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I SO have to check out your other question now. :-)<br>  <br>  I'm not slow... but just logged in a few minutes ago. :-D|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	To answer you question "NO PEOPLE HERE CAN'T READ!!!"<br>  They glance over the details and assume way too much.<br>  If feel most people have a preset generic answer to every question asked, especially the religious zealots who have to reference God or the Bible.|`|4U1822AXaa	lol! well, i'm going to read it for the first time, right now. <br>  <br>  :)
jPJ9MTCwaa	I think red or black shoes would look lovely.  Red would be a bit more daring and fun.  Black would be a bit more classic and understated though.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Dye the shoes the same color as the dress or white, beige, or silver|`|RxBe4y3Waa	silver goes great with aqua.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I was going to say silver also, but gold would also look great as long as it was a delicate strap and nothing chunky|`|6ut6qMwraa	silver,white|`|EsnFmcMFaa	wear the the same color aqua shoes    or maybe white shoes|`|QNuW7ivyaa	If you dont want to do the dyable - dyed to match - shoes... i personally always loved Aqua and Silver (than again i have a sterling set Aquamarine ring, myself)  The silver works well with garnet too (my sister has the same ring i do, in her birthstone - how funny!)    A simple silver shoe isnt hard to find, and is usually cheaper than those you dye.|`|DqetlSB6aa	silver- thin straps though    http://i11.ebayimg.com/04/s/07/7a/72/45_...  http://www.shoebuy.com/pi/dyeab/dyeab201...      or aquamarine|`|POFdWpUzaa	I think you should jazz things up a bit and have them wear shoes that match flower or something in their hair.

Good Luck|`|yaaNbLeyaa	I think you should have the shoes dyed to match the dresses - it's classic and not trendy.  I may be old fashioned but do you want people looking at you, the bride, or the bridesmaid's shoes?  You don't want to have wedding pictures you'll one day laugh at so keep it simple.|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	you can red shoes to match the red flower in their hair  Silver  White|`|JAdNkzENaa	i say make it easy and let them wear black shoes. or white really. sont make them matchy matchy becasue its annoying lol|`|nvHcLzuZaa	Shiny silver/ glittery shoes i think, dolly pumps would be my first choice, i remember having to wear heels to 2 wedding in one summer, what a nightmare! anyway, flat shiny shoes :)|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Aqua.  Shoes that match their dresses.  You can get dyable shoes in any nice shoe store.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	The garnet colour, same as the flower in their hair. It will balance the outfit nicely to have highlights of colour.
HOQp0gA7aa	I would speculate that is because "God" and "Allah" fearing men have felt it traditional in their faith to subjugate women under patriarchal control for thousands of years.  The majority of modern women in Western Cultures are beginning to learn (on a Historical scale) that misogynistic treatment is not their due in life, and are viewing men who insist women have a subservient role based on their faith as possibly less than ideal husband material.    In the short term this means a reduction in women interested in this kind of role in life.  In the long term it probably means that unless "God" and "Allah" fearing men change their attitudes about women, they will likely become a dieing breed as they become unable to pass on their beliefs to subsequent generations.    I hope this helps.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	God fearing men are usually arrogant, self centred, controlling and narrow minded. Who would want one, well, only another messed up person would. So yes, you'll have to find one in church.|`|AA10950898	We're not afraid, it's just that there aren't any out there.|`|jPcgQoNJaa	This is a great question and one that will have a million different answers but i think it has to do with the fact that woman love a man that leads and is in control off his life and a "God-fearing man" leaves his life in the hands of his God.|`|p0a1dB28aa	Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming when a saved man approaches you. Truthful it is no different than any other guy trying to get with you. However it is extra weary when a saved man tries to get with you because he tries to use that as a advantage. Like oh I am good I am a saved I wont' hurt approach. Yes allot of women are sexual in church only because they have a lack of love that they are receiving. Not because they are sneaky females. They want to be rewarded for there good behavior and back slide because we are human. They want true love and for some reason will trick their brain into thinking it's OK and validated for there own self satisfaction. It's deep there is really no black or white answer.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	I think you are generalising and, in my opinion, that is always an inaccurate supposition based on ones own experiences and bias.  Generalisations are those type of statements that fail to see reality.  It may be that you are not looking for these women in the right places.  I am not saying that church is the right or only place to look but I know many women who are dead happy with God fearing men.  It may be that the God fearing men or man may have to do some introspection and see if his values are those of God or those that one or other church is preaching.  And yes I am saying that the dogma of some churches are Scripturally incorrect.  Don't blame God, blame those people who create an image in their minds that are based on human definitions.  It is not so much looking in the wrong places but looking with the wrong eyes for the wrong people.|`|Hbf5G8C9aa	hmmm - because it just sound bloody scary. Girls just wanna have fun - not preached to by a scary father figure.|`|9Yyk1p2Saa	You will find the right woman when you are meant to. Just keep praying. It took me a while to find the right man and yes he is God fearing. Your soul mate is out there just keep looking. Good luck.|`|AA10746826	I'm not. I tried to talk to YOU but you are ignoring me. Why is it when a guy find a GOOD girl they don't want them?
ai4lrclMaa	I think you've been badly and recently hurt. So you are hitting out at the people who most remind you of the hurt...women.Personally, I am pretty insulted by the implication that I, as a woman, am a grasping, avaricious, unfeeling wh ore. Maybe I'm being too sensitive.LMFAO!!    And further I would like to share my opinion..... that far too many men AND women think that material possessions will make them happier than being with someone great whilst living in a tent. I think the whole effing society has got to be so grasping, so selfish, so narrow and greedy that we have almost forgotten HOW to form the sorts of relationships that our grandparents and parents were able to form.Loving, lasting, selfless unions which enriched both partners spiritually, though often not economically.    How many marriages of today do you think will survive until they're getting Golden Anniversary cards? Not too many, is my guess. We don't seem to like longevity in personal committments any more.    And I think that is a great pity. Because if it keeps up, pretty soon the world will be devoid of love entirely. And we will all consult an accountant and an investment broker before we decide to wed.    But then I am just one of those b itches you hate so much. So why the eff would I have anything worthwhile to say?  LOL!!|`|AA12041870	And you are so right to prefer to be alone rather than with a money grubbing woman that doesn't love you.  A person like you keeps a person like her from having to work for a living but gives them everything they want at your expense.  Don't let someone do that to you.|`|jR6QWSfraa	I agree they all love money, but who dosn't? We all do  don't you love money?  and let me tell you the point, money make the life easy. so even if the person is old or ugly or stupid the money will cover for that. money means happiness for some people.|`|gRsuXxkbaa	u seem bitter about something  - I wonder what that is exactly|`|HVY2rqzfaa	If a girl is just going to like you for your money then there really is no point, unless you are well aware of this and are prepared to have a very superficial relationship.    To say that most women are is wrong though, because this is not the case. Not all women are gold diggers although I would say that the majority of women would like a man who can at least finance himself (at the very least). I work for my money I expect my man to as well (unless he wants to be on childcare duty).|`|lJXH22nQaa	Many women are instinctively attracted to men who can provide Security just as Men are instinctively attracted to women with curvaceous bodies. Its all in our animal instincts that women seek security (often financial) and men healthy genes for survival purposes.|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	What is the one thing older women hate more than anything else in the world? Older man younger woman couples. (who doesnt know that besides the blind. Not all older women. My mother was married to a much older man, but, older women in general)    Older mothers are the indoctrinators of the planet since they are the child bearers. They indoctrinate their children to believe its wrong  for a female to admire a male's success because they know that is what blinds young women to the fade of older males. So, mothers teach their sons to study in school so they can be successful and then teach their daughters to believe its wrong to admire the success of their successful son.     Older mothers did not indoctrinate their children to call a 55 year old woman who chases  a rich 35 year old man a gold digger or a 35 year old woman who chases a rich 35 year old woman a gold digger. They only indocrinate their children to call a YOUNG woman who chases a successful older male a gold digger. Older mothers dont indoctrinate male children to believe its wrong to chase a rich woman 20 years our senior, therefor we are never called gold digger. In fact, we are encouraged by older women to chase wealthy older women.     But the reality is, its better to be admired for your money than for your looks because looks fade. Money fades too but it can still buy things.     Did you know females married to accomplished males are less likely to file for divorce AND TO CHEAT than females married to poorer males? Its one of the paradoxes marriage researchers laugh at behind closed doors.     Personally, Id rather have a faithful woman who wants me for money than a cheating one who wants me for me.  Fidelity is more important to me than love. I cant handle a cheater.     Thanks to money... I wont ever have to wear cosmetics when I get older. Money is the reason males dont use cosmetics. Dudes, its either money or cosmetics. Choose your competitive weapon wisely.    Remember the golden cliche: money cant buy love and happiness.....but at least with money you wont wont have to date toothless trailer trash.|`|12XKDq4Faa	Then she may as well be a hooker.|`|fc4qv3vPaa	find better girls and/or lower your standards for women|`|6wh7lHpyaa	you're right MOST are but not all    try finding a girl without telling her how big ur bank account is n c if she likes u for u|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Well thats why i usually never date a woman without a job or one that can't take care of herself.  You know if a woman your dating refuses to work or pich in for a dinner once and a while she's a moochen scrub.  So find a woman who wants to have a career not sit at home waiting for you to bring home the bacon.  And there are woman who want to actually work.    If you see a goldigger play into it and say you have money, have sexual intercourse with her with a comdom of course and never speak to her again.   If you find a good one keep her around|`|WC2bTHkKaa	Well if she's just after your money then leave her alone. Go far, far, far away.

That's like saying " all guys want is our body ". It may seem like it's true, but it isn't. So don't give up. Keep looking. Actually don't. She will come along when you least expect it, and you will know that she is the one.|`|4isLyM5paa	I didn't know most women ONLY liked someone for money.   If she doesn't work then she wont want to feel that your having major money problems, and if she does then she doesn't want to feel like she is bringing in all the money herself.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	You get used to it. Girls tend to be attractive to boys, some are nicer than others, most are actually, laugh. Good or bad everyone is out to do the best they can for themselves, boys or girls. Money is very attractive! Very useful no matter who you are. Next most important thing is looks, an artificial transient thing used by God to make you want her or him, laugh. We all get old and ugly with very few exceptions but money still looks good whether your old or young. You pay, get used to that idea, you get used, sorry but that seems to be a part of life. In the end if she wants what is best for you and you want what is best for her even if it is not your ideal it works out, never perfect but it works out good then. Focus on people who want what is good for you rather than just good looks or a good time ( that you pay for)|`|DESWKtdgaa	The SEX is the point! Thats why when someones with you for your money they have to be really, really hot or just don't bother! Its OK to be with someone like that for a laugh, because they pretty much do everything you say, I used to have jokes with my mates about my GF who was like that! Just don't expect anything long-term from it!|`|1RnWLGnmaa	if a girls just after your money, get rid of her.  that ones easy.      and i know you said you don't want to hear it but not all girls are 'golddiggers' not by far!  and i can prove that because i'm a girl and i honestly don't give a **** how much money someone has, its juust that, well in older situations (30-40 etc) more money ovbiously comes VERY in handy. whereas if your a teenager your not dating someone for their money, your young! so yours dating them for their personality.      hope i helped!|`|WjMbU6xuaa	Women like successful men. Women like winners. If you are successful you no doubt have plenty of money and it follows you will attract lots of women.    If on the other hand you are a dead beat loser with little or no money you will just have to accept that you will be living life either alone or with so real low rent female that no one else wants.    It simple really.  I hope this helps.
CqQ1DaKDaa	When I wanted to be alone I used to find a time where everyone in the house had something to do or go somewhere and then invite my boyfriend over, but it wasn't for those reasons. Or we'd go walk the dog in the woods/grave yard so we'd be alone to talk about things.  Also you deffinatly sure you're both physically and emotionally ready for sexual relationships hun? It may feel like you do, but you got to know you'll be able to deal with a guy breaking your heart or using you etc. as it does happen quite often.   Everyone has a sensitive spot that turns them on, mine is my back, then it is my neck. Experiment really, by kising his neck softly, gently scratching his back with your nails, and I emphasize gently, or maybe touching his ears whilst running your hand through his hair. A more obvious way to turn him on is by gently rubbing his crotch area. Acting like a tease also gets them turned on as it makes you seem more desirable.   Hope I helped  Raych|`|suKoM2owaa	just kiss him and let him touch you b00bs. that'll give him a b.0.n.e.r alright, and if you're not careful he's gonna want to use it...so don't give him one....|`|aSx2kEb8aa	do the move emma|`|22247c23a55dead202cad38509a7aee0aa	emma emma emma... the rush to adulthood is so so  quick and your there for such a long long long time. sweetie i let my  daughter go on group dates she is about  your age. in a group date she has several of her girlfriends who meetin a public place like the mall and see all their male friends there. usually  acouple of parents are there sitting in the cafe area the gang see a movie do some shopping hug and kiss each other goodbye and agree to meet again at  some future time. sex is messy at your age too messy emotionally and too messy for the consequences. wait and when the time is right an understanding parent will help you understand properly  so  you can make an informed choice. a baby is for life, and so  are many sexually transmitted infections...|`|uRc8z7gjaa	gift idea      http://www.amazon.com/gp/gift-central?ta...

It sounds like you want to get it on with  him, but you are still young. If your mum is smart she won"t give you that opportunity to be alone with a guy specially at home. So why can't you hang out alone together in public (a Park, or Library is always a good hangout ) if your intentions are no more than just kissing.  AS for the other question ..... you will naturally give the young boy a *****  just by passionately kissing, that is if he is not gay. Good Luck! Play it safe!|`|GfphOIdOaa	maybe you should wait another 2 years to explore your sexuality.   if you still insist, stroking his manhood is for sure a way to get it up. showing your chest to him will likely do the job as well. letting him play with them or letting him feel other private parts of you will surely make him rise.

So you have to respect her and her choice. You have no right to force her into that if it is against her will. Forcing her to have sex = rape.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Why doesn't she want to have sex with you?  Religious, mental or she has another?  Would you buy shoes without trying them on?

If you FORCE her to do things you'll only push her away.  She has every right to keep her virginity!    When she's ready she'll be ready.    It takes two you know.  It's unfair if you're the only one sure about it.  Both of you need to enjoy it.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Wtheckkk? Seriously, just another guy trying to get some and that's it! Let her keep her virginity till she's ready! Plus you guys haven't even been going out for that long. On top of that go back to school! People only focus on sex now a days and forget about the important things in life.|`|Yl4iHHBqaa	don't try to convince her just be faithful for another 6 months and im sure she'll feel more secure with you and give you what you want shes a virgin and she has been for awhile longer then most people she isnt just gonna give it out to anyone|`|8816fe6eb0864760b3fcfaf44e012d7faa	If you respect her:  Back off and don't push her.  Enjoy the time you spend together, and work on building a strong and meaningful relationship.  The both of you will know when the time is right.  And if your really horny, masturbate.    If you don't respect her:  Break up with her.  At least give her the chance to be with guy who is not a selfish prick who only cares about sex.  Then, get yourself a hooker (enjoy the VD)|`|41NyT8oPaa	Have you ever realise that maybe she is not ready, 6 months might be too soon for her and on top of that she is a virgin, give her time and be patient if you really love her, i'm sure you are not with her for that only. Let her be comfortable , it doesn't matter if she is 19, she will do it when she feels that she is ready to give it all to you.|`|y5qZRyLraa	Don't do anything!  When she wants to, she'll do it.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Nothing - she'll have sex when she's ready and not before.  If you don't like it, leave her and find someone that will have sex.  Don't be a jerk - if you are with her because you love her, you'll wait for as long as it takes.  But trying to push her into something she doesn't want is wrong and unfair.  If you've just been with her in the hope you'll get laid, well, she'd be better off without you.|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	Honestly, the more you support her decision to not have sex right now - the more attractive you'll seem to her. If you tell her that it's okay and that you can wait for her, chances are she'll come around to the idea a lot quicker.     If you try to convince her to have sex with you - you'll only succeed in pushing her away and making her lose respect for you. Never, ever force, push, or try to convince a woman to have sex with you before she's ready. If you wait until the right time, it'll be much more special for the both of you.     Besides, how satisfying can the sex be if you've got it in the back of your mind: "Is she doing this because she wants to? Or is she doing it because I want her to? Is she enjoying it or will she hate me for it later? What if she regrets it? What if she breaks up with me over it?"     Yeah, think about all that. But, if the kissing on the body and what not is making it difficult for you to control your needs and urges, tell her that you need to cool off from that because you really want to respect her wishes but it's making it difficult for you with all the physical contact like that between the two of you.     But whatever you do, don't force her. A woman losing her virginity is a big deal and it's something she'll remember more than likely for the rest of her life. You don't want to be the one she looks back on and wishes she'd never let you talk her into it, do you? Of course not. So just wait for her, if you love her enough then it will be worth the wait. Sex isn't everything.|`|aud9kyK1aa	1 get her drunk.  2 tell her in a with a firm voice that u think it is time  3 give her options like- i really need to have sex and if im not going to get it from u i will be forced to go somewhere else   4 she could be very insecure  with her body and not sure of herself yet which in that case just tell how beautiful she is and how much u really love her   5 u have to remember that when u lose ur virginity it is probally the most uncomfortable Sexual experience that u will have because u don't really know what ur doing and for a women it is 10 times harder than men because u really lose something men don't|`|gL0lWAJcaa	if u must do it, you have to marry her has in case now she is a virgin.

Keep an open heart you will find what your heart desires.|`|AA10182431	I disagree...I think you can fall completely and totally in love more than one time in your life.  Your right, that often times you will just be in love sometimes and that there is a difference, but I don't think life would be as wonderful as it is if you were only allowed to experience falling truly in love just once in your lifetime.  Especially if that one time was early in life and that person taken away from you.  I think it is more about a person being able to let go of the first time of falling in love and allowing themselves at some point to really truly fall in love again.|`|AA11110297	doesn't matter to me
AA12116295	Just tell her how you feel. It might sound simple but all you have yo do is just be your self and let her know whats on your mind. Tell her that you understand that you are friends now but you would like to take it to the next lvl. Ask her what her feelings are and where her mind is at. You might find that she has some feelings for you too or you might just find that she just wants to be friends. Whtever she says its always best to know something then to not know anything at all.    This might lead to something in the future if not nothing now. Just tell her what you think and see where it takes you. You never know what could happen......|`|AA11826783	Be funny, be supportive, listen, talk, be true to your heart!

I know girls who have flocks of guys who follow them around town.  All of them want to be the one, but the only one who knows if it is any of them at all is her, and she's not tellin' cause she likes the attention.    I say go for it.  Ask her out, tell her you like her, what ever.  Don't chicken out.  If you are the one, it will be great.  If you are not, atleast you won't be one of the idiots who follow her around hoping to be.      If she's not interested but the friendship is strong, the friendship will survive.  If the friendship falls apart, she's a loser.

That you wanted a child to love and that you thought that maybe one day you would meet someone that would be a very good dad for him/her.  I feel like this day and time that you should be able to do what you want in that perspective.  I applaud you for it.  Good luck in whatever you decide.|`|AA10231289	I think you should do what you want. Don't let others decide for you. I'm  a lesbian so if i have a kid I'd have to be artificial inseminated or adopt. Alot of people say it's wrong but same sex couples can raise a child as well as opposite sex couples. Don't worry about what you will tell the child now, take one day at a time. Good Luck 2 ya !!!!|`|AA11104372	Unfortunately, it is selfish.  You would be deliberately denying your child a father.  Fathers are incredibly important.  Why not consider adopting an older, harder to place child?  While I think every child deserves a mother and a father, a loving,single parent beats the foster system any day.  Good luck!|`|AA12059542	i would never choose to be a single mom... i wasn't given the choice.... that is selfish and i think every child deserves a dad of some kind.

479ab563ac9c268e753efea6dbe22126aa	It's hard to 'prevent' it in any other way than not hanging out with that person.  Best thing you can do is tell them to ease up.  Give you some space.  Etc.  Be as nice as you can about it, but make sure to get the point accross so that it doesn't continue to happen.|`|AA11864596	Try to portray a no-nonsense exterior. Don't engage in unnecessary conversation. If you need to communicate with him, be curt and to the point. If he continues to be overly gregarious, show him through your actions that you don't enjoy his advances.    If you feel he is mature enough to understand your discomfort, talk to him about his behavior and how it is affecting you. Let him know that you're not interested in having a relationship that extends beyond friendship.    Unfortunately however, there are instances when men continue to make advances despite a woman's expressions of discontent. In such circumstances the best thing to do is avoid him at all costs. If his behavior turns into harassment, I would suggest reporting him to the relevant authorities.    Good luck :).

AA11137435	Kiss-brush or caress with the lips: to touch somebody or something with the lips, either gently or passionately  *caressing done with the lips: a gentle or passionate touch with the lips     It means that the people are passionate about each other, they actually like each other, but they don't love each other enough to go out with each other. They really care about one another, but they might not be 100% sure about what they want. They are usually confused and just go through life as it goes.|`|VihiaZjdaa	That they like kissing.

Me and my fiance tackled this feeling with a nurses outfit, and a maid outfit, both proved very successful. We always try to do new things, but becuase of the obvious fianceness we both are happy with the whole steady relationship, marriage, kids etc.   He is probably one of these young guys that just want to hop from on girl tot he next because they're bored of life. If you still love him propose a two week trial where you should try new things, and maybe a bit of roleplay. If it doesn't work out just accept it and stay friends maybe.|`|FpGpxAb2aa	Yea...His right...he IS shallow  What a pathetic way to end a beautiful relationship...sweetheart u know as well as i do that he WILL wake up one day and realise the loneliness of jumping from one girl to another.  yea i don't have much advice but i agree with you, and belive ur (ex) bf was in the wrong!...What he said is just down right mean and shellfish and he had no right to make you feel that way   I know ur hurting at the moment and u need ur time and space to recover...but think about it how LONG is HE worth the recovery time?|`|og3Tmn0saa	He needs to grow up and realize a mature relationship lacks the new feeling.

6LxXR61Waa	If you don't love them at all, even as a friend, then you shouldn't be with them.

AA12399278	Wow, he loves you, you love him, and you both love spending time together, wish I had your problems! ;)    Seriously though, you're confused and scared to get hurt, and if you never get over that you will be alone and lonely for the rest of your life. If you know that one day you will have to get over these fears, and you have a golden opportunity now, what possible reason would you have to not make today the day that you face those fears and move ahead in life? You'll never have an opportunity with less risk in it, I mean you guys already know you love each other! Never facing your fears and living all alone until the day you die is massivley more hurtful than any break-up that you could ever possibly risk anyways. Go for it, enjoy life, I promise you will be glad you did!|`|AA11279777	Let me put it this way dear, you only have 1 life to live, why not live it.

Unless he has a history in hurting girls, that is.  If he does have a history...How do you know it will be the same with you? Take the chance and keep a close eye on him for a couple of weeks. If everything seems alright, chances are that they ARE alright. But if he does seems sorta suspicious then I would call "Uncle" and get out of it while you can. If he doesn't have a history.....Then you should definitely take this chance. You'll more than likely find that it was TOTALLY worth it. Who knows? this guy could be the man of yer dreams, he's just hiding behind a mask, once you say yes then the mask will disappear. If he has already said that he loves you then chances are that this is SO a chance you should take. Guys normally have a hard time saying that, so GOOD LUCK!

Recoge flores aunque tengan espinas y marca camino aunque levante polvo.  *Uno crece cuando es capaz de afianzarse con residuos de ilusiones;  capaz de perfumarse con residuos de flores... y de encenderse con   residuos de amor.  *Uno crece dndole a la vida ms de lo que recibe.|`|qRJcZMR4aa	Si hablas de un da?o por tanto tiempo, te aseguro que el otro es complice tuyo por lo que no deberias cargar con toda la culpa.

Nothing bothers you., All is happy all is peaceful... you miss being next to that person and when you are with them you feel that you will miss them when they or you go.. I think 2 to 3 months is a nice time to say it..............  not in a week...    Just before you say anything about love.. consider your relationship...think with the heart, but also with the mind...  use logic..   Love is a beautiful thing but it can also be the most hurtful thing if it ends or you are dumped... just don't put way too much of yourself into it, unless you are getting the same back........ love between a couple is and should always be MUTUAL and not ONE SIDED... sex, etc isnt love... many times guys use girls... dont be used... make sure you are comfortable and that your partner is compatible and give you love back.. if not, it's just infatuation in your part... look it up in the dictionary...  so love and be loved back or dont love at all...............    . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know...

He probably wants to tickle you with his feather duster and show you what is under his apron.|`|4eLLjTzzaa	I think if he's honestly, freely willing to "play" with you in this way it's wonderful!  But if he shows ANY signs of hesitation or that he changed his mind, don't push him.  He might come back to the idea at another time.  I dated a man who loved to tease me by dusting my bookshelves wearing only an apron...a frilly black and white one.  It was so much fun! =)

d227528a85c814aa711fc4048921e7f6aa	Open communication, understanding each others feelings, respecting each other and most of all the very essence of love and friendship is always around... life is full of test, not every marriage is made of joy and happiness  there is always this test in life that we have to face  and this makes a relationship stronger that ever..  there is sometimes arguement but with an open communication and respect with each other this could be resolve in a nice way both must be open minded to accept each other suggestion things could be better decided if both angles can be seen..|`|AA11110297	here's how me and my hubby get through hard times --- we take it to the Lord in prayer and we get other Christians praying for us and that has worked everytime ---- we still together --- doing fine|`|67db81276a8041aa4f5500ac53782ddcaa	You must talk and work together. Keep in mind that it is just the two of you against the world. Every time things were bad for us, I would start a project. Like painting a room. Soon we were talking about the color, what roller we needed, when  to do it. Put some music on, drink a few beers, laugh at mistakes. The little things you were picking on each other about just melt away. Your working as a team!
AA11689655	Two people who want to engage in casual sex should do so, be safe, and enjoy.  There is no reason not to.    Personally, I prefer relationships that are deeper and have been giving a chance to grow over time.  I like passion and emotional connection.

AA12059542	you are disgusting to me.... if he will leave her- for you... he will leave you - for someone better looking too... that's so shallow... you ain't the best thing to ever walk the earth and there will always be better.... so get over yourself and find your own man,,, that sounds pretty desperate if you ask me! you know that's some dirty, dirty girl.... perhaps he loves her, for her... not all people  love people for how they look... OH but shallow people don't know that!|`|b9a1f9997a3e751a12c661485452507aaa	S.A.B.O.T.A.G.E!!! You must sabotage your boyfriend and this other personality of yours.|`|aeb605f7d8e8932a744c14ca488a2f98aa	ok, suppose he does leave her for you. Would you feel secure in your relationship with him then? Because he already left one gf to be with the next, so what's gonna stop him from leaving you for another woman?
AA11449470	personally, i dont think there's much harm in flirting, as long as you know the other person feels comfortable with it too. of course, there is a limit, as with everything. if you go around flirting heavily with every guy you see, then you will probably be labled a "slut". so just keep it short and sweet, maybe try just with guys/girls who are really good friends.|`|AA12059542	people then believe you are easy and slutty...

5Wr9Mlwoaa	Impossible. And often this is even true with kids.    Class is dismissed.|`|0ylm04PWaa	Does unconditionally include cheating, abuse, stealing, habitual lying? If so, answer is no.|`|WDJH7KBEaa	Honestly i don't think so...|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Yes, why not? Your spouse becomes part of your family, so why would you want to dispose of your family?|`|b072771e0ce9d50e2eb422756b55e11eaa	Unconditional love is impossible except in the case of a child.|`|AA11206135	I bought the book yesterday after seeing so much about it..Unconditional love for your spouse isn't easy... but it IS what God had planned.. Husbands are to love their wives as God loves His church.. and that is unconditionally... No one is perfect, but loving one's spouse this way isa worthy goal and comes with great rewards.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes I absolutely love my husband unconditionally.  It doesn't mean that I cannot disagree with him or get angry or be disappointed in him.  In fact, sometimes I don't like him much, but I still love him.    It does mean that *No Matter What* I will always love him and be there for him.     Why is that so hard for you to believe?|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Yes it is possible.Are you married?You must not be because if you were you would know that you can love your husband/wife and children unconditionally.I love my husband no matter what.I love him for who he is even with his faults(vice versa).  I absolutely agree with maccrew.She knows exactly what she is talking about.If you have God in your marriage and in your life you would know that you do and can love your husband unconditonally.Its not easy sometimes but with God all things are possible.|`|5jMNBO2naa	no such thing  all love is conditional  as true love never let's itself be taken advantage of  and you never would be in a relationship where the "love"  is only one sided,  a baby's love maybe be unconditional, but that's only because he totally depends on you, a baby will bond with anyone who treat them well and feeds them, not just the mother, a dog does the very same thing..  well all love in hopes of getting something in return|`|YUtUsxLbaa	No.  It can be fully, strong, true. and can be blinding - but not unconditional.  Someone in denial can think that theirs is, but unconditional it isn't.|`|a7YmPtEtaa	I do believe unconditional love exists between husband and wife, but unconditional Like doesn't.  I don't like everything about my husband, but I love him unconditionally.  I don't have to like him, but I can't stop loving him.|`|910b198e71ca8d3098c6121db6c23d2aaa	Unconditional love exists. It exists in the form of Jesus' love for all people, in the form of God's love for humanity, in the form of a parent's love for their children, and in the form of marriage. Just because not all of us are capable of such love does not mean that it does not exist.     Don't confuse unconditional love with not protecting yourself or being a doormat. Just because you love someone unconditionally does not mean that you will allow them to take advantage of you.     Love is an action. It involves doing something like making peace when you're really mad at your spouse. It involves showing your spouse that you appreciate them when you don't feel like it. It involves being kind to your spouse even when they have done something unkind to you. It takes a very mature person to act contrary to the way their heart might want them to act. This is why it is unconditional. It is not based on anything your spouse has done, it is based on who they are. They are your spouse. You are supposed to love them in spite of their weaknesses, in spite of their failures, in spite of their sin.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	That's just an invitation to the spouse to take advantage of you. Beat me, get high, cheat, be a pig, I still love you. We have to set boundaries for our own preservation.|`|5M0FBU89aa	I'm somewhat confused about your question, because it's really two- unconditional marriage-love and  unconditional  parental love.      MARRIAGE:  I don't think so.  It's an ideal we strive for, but we are individual people with our own personal needs.       People tend to qualify this question a lot; the typical rationalization is "I love my "X", but I don't like him/her at the moment.... Well, good luck with that.    We try our best in marriage to meet the other person's needs, but If we don't meet theirs and/or they're not meeting ours, then the marriage is in trouble.    Even when children are involved, it is not "divorce-insurance" - in fact, it can be one of the WORST reasons for having children.    To those that have found unconditional marriage-love through parenthood, I salute you-  but I don't think it's the children, as much at the dual-focus that both you and your spouse have for your beautiful bundle(s) of joy.    PARENTHOOD:  My own experience with children- One loves me, the other hates me (because I left the house after discovering my ex was a lying, cheating sociopath and I  eventually remarried. My daughter too is prolly a psychopath - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.   My son, wife,  and I get along great-  I'm very thankful for that).    I love my daughter, but she doesn't love me back- we don't really even communicate very much anymore (for years - she's in her 20's.)  But yes, I love her - I just don't know either what "kind" of love it is.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	No.  I didn't know unconditional love until having a child.|`|5k7BexD3aa	No...You love your husband because he treats you well etc...  If he beat you, smoked crack in front of your kids, didn't work, etc...that love would fade away real fast.  I think the ONLY unconditional love is for your child.
8K3IucU3aa	i had a similar problem. i made two friends and i introduced them and they ran off and left me alone all the time. a real friend wouldn't do that to you. i wouldn't say you need to drop her as a friend but you need let her know that you aren't going to take her crap. she has no reason to be mean to you so don't let her be mean to you because if you don't stand up for yourself people will walk all over you and life will suck. i had a friend for 10 years and she proved to me that she didn't care about my feelings so i'm not friends with her. i miss her sometimes but life is better now. you have other friends don't you? don't cling to her. don't let her treat you that way. she's obviously too full of herself to care about anyone else. she will realize what she's doing eventually.|`|zl7sqHZMaa	yes|`|D92vrOAlaa	cant help you out make friends with someone she dont like and show off|`|WbmWe4K8aa	i knw u said plz dnt tell u thz but thts really the only thing u can do if she is ignorinin u but u juz gonna hav 2 really 4get bout her n move on n find more friends .........sorry ?????????|`|4TWfpvA5aa	well you know that always happened with really long term friends... but if you guys are truly are that close you will overcome it..:) the best thing to do is talk about it with her... but don't be mean about because then she is gonna think your mad at her and then she will get mad at you and that will cause a whole other thing.. so you should talk to her about it and tell her that what she is doing is really bothering u...  and no she is not ditching u.. u probably just think she is being mean because you are not as close as before....    i hope everything works out for you....|`|RcVSPsHPaa	andrea seems like a bit of a *****, maybe she is bitter because of her name.      No, serious answer now. This is happening to me and i am struggling. Try your best to ignore them and if it suddenly gets to you(as it does with me), remove yourself from the situation, smile to yourself and remind yourself of all the other great friends you have. If all esle fails, maybe when claudia looks back on pictures of when you are young she will realise the twat she has been.|`|xK2IMLPLaa	Talk to her about it and tell her how you feel|`|w52W5Ch3aa	hm. well maybe she just needed a friend she could rely and and you just weren't it. maybe you are drama to her. leave her alone untill she gets bored of her new friend. if shes out of your sight shes out of your mind. just stay away untill she comes up to you. never run after someone.    must be independent|`|OIREN5Jeaa	Get a new friend|`|4yTx07Pxaa	tak to her about it..express that you've known each other for years and its stupid to treat you like this. she'll come around..|`|LzZtdlc8aa	find a new friend or friends and hang out with them.....fight fire with fire.....but dont be mean or start rumors or anything just ignore her for awhile and if she starts to miss your friendship then she will come to you if not then she was never really your friend to begin with plus look at her zodiac signs......aries and sagittariuses have a tendancy to use people and forget about them cuz they are so caught up in themselves
71yXXY3eaa	He is still confused and unable to cope with all of the emotional strife that has gone on between you and him along with his ex-girlfriend.  It can take time for him to recover and come back to reality.  I would suggest just taking it in stride and if you show to him that you care about him consistently he eventually will break away from his old state of mind.|`|DiSOdCFXaa	it's obvious he wanted you for sex ans stuff|`|5RHQs5DPaa	Men will do this to you you're whole life.  It's funny -- they will disappear for weeks or months and then suddenly reappear, only to repeat the cycle again if you continue to show any interest.    Don't waste your time on this one!  He'll just make you resentful, eventually.|`|1LTvtdnHaa	He is playing games.  He stops texting you because his girlfriend probably comes into the room.  Same reason he doesn't answer your calls.  You can't have a relationship that is meaningful if he is still in a relationship with someone else.  Leave him completely alone, if he breaks up with her and comes to you, then you can decide what you want to do|`|ndnsUfFYaa	You just threw everything upside down. Men like to put everything in their place.  Girls we like go here  Friends/Guys go here  ect ect  Not to be mean which is not my point mind you. You were probably considered in the "one of the guys" category. He could have feelings for you hidden but when he looked at you. You feel into that category.   BANG!   You kissed. So now he is confused. He doesn't know how to act. He is thinking through all the things he said to you in the past. So he is bashful, scared, and internally confused. Being patient is the best path to take here.  You have a task of your own to take on. Do you like him? If that is a yes then you need to be patient and wait for him to come around. Work your female magic. Giggle, hair flip and a simple touch on his shoulder. These action set off chain reactions with us guys. it make 0 sense but *shrug* My wife got me when she giggled at my jokes. hehe    If you do not like him, then you could go an easy route and return to "best buds" like actions. Sigh some of these are gross but QUICKLY effective. lol Burp BOOM all thoughts of gf/bf are gone and laughing returns. Its a crude example but i bet it made you smile.    Remember love is all about mistakes. Just remember one thing. Each time you fall pick yourself up, pull out the notebook write down what you learned and keep on going!
xH9T6FU2aa	Better yet, take her shopping!|`|DuG9NaaZaa	if she likes to cook get something from william and sonoma if she wants clothes do something like macys or ann taylor,|`|l5jF3oxgaa	go to a class to learn how to sew. and sew her a complete darling outfit.

la9zji2Uaa	It's not good is it. Very worrying time at the moment. Keeping my fingers crossed for myself.... x|`|BaNrweQ4aa	encourage her to look for work elsewhere; and really try and her a job soon :) the more help the better at the momnet. when you aren't looking for jobs - do things to take her mind off it :)|`|dFHsAXDMaa	Times are so hard for many Americans right now and it is only going to get a lot worse before it gets better people need to really save everything they can right now unfortunately that may mean giving up things like nights out to eat, renting movies buying big purchases. really I do not see this stimulus package really making a big difference anytime immediately especially if you were a responsible person who paid your bills the money is going to go to states and mortgage companies to help people refinance who are on the verge of foreclosure but people who have paid and struggled and managed to actually keep up and pay are really not going to have an easy time refinancing because money is going to be used for the irresponsible. do not get me wrong I think the 10,000 families a day facing foreclosure should recieve help but unfortunately many people over extended themselves in the idea that we have to "keep up with the jones" lifestyles americans have been living for so long can't afford to pay for it well then charge it. parents have a hard time now a days saying no to kids when they want things and feel guilty it is okay to say no, kids need to understand how life works and that money does not grow on trees. <br>  <br>  I grew up with a father who always taught us if you cannot afford to pay cash do not buy it save for it. if you buy a car you can not pay off in a year in a half two years tops before it depreciates do not buy it. I used to resent his way of thinking when I saw all my friends in college ssaying charge it. but now I am so glad he raised us with that sense of responsibilty because I have great great, I paid cash for my condominium after college living at home and working for 3 years to save  for it and I have  no car loan. I am 39 years old and a mother of 4 great kids  and I have the security of knowing even if I was to loose my job we would have a home still. and I have enough in the bank to hold us over for at least a year. <br>  <br>  we are headed for a great depression again there is not a doubt in my mind. we will see the day again when americans are waiting in line for their food allotments monthly of things like butter, milk,  meat etc like our grand parents did in the 1930's. And that is kind of sad isn't it that the land of opportunity has so over extended themselves that we are now the laughing stalk of the world. Hopeful Obama can handle the job he has taken on and we will all continue to hold our breathe everyday.  it is definitely going to take more than 4 years so hopefully he will get re-elected because changing presidents once we start an unhill climb in the economy will just stall progress. <br>  <br>  Tell your friend I feel for her and her situation and she will be in my prayers along with all the other people fighting daily to survive. God Bless
6x3ZqVpOaa	hey mr. proud ...will you stop it ...ok you were the topper and blah blah blah ...but hey she is your classmate ...she must have said that just to  tease you a little . in fact the mere fact she teased you proves that evryone thinks that you are the smartest in your class and that everyone was expecting you to top . leave her alone for god sake . she was just having some fun . dont tell her anything tomorrow .    try to be smart AND friendly . coz the way you have written your question indicates your cold behaviour .|`|1xKS2ak6aa	Dont worry, it was probably by luck.  Just because she got a A on the test doesnt mean she will always  and besides you said she was dumb, maybe she's not as dumb as you think  Maybe she knows a way to cheat, with her BFF. Next time you should spy on her during her test, I mean one time I saw this dumb blonde (this REALLY dumb blonde) cheating on her science test and she got a A+ while I got a A. -.-  but meanwhile act cool about it  go like  "Hey, Congratulations on your test, its your first time getting an A right?"

AA11764375	I can understand why she's feeling distant,I know I would feel overwhelmed...it's a tough call.I would say wait it out,try to get her talk about about what she's feeling,have some patience...it's gotta be a scary time for her and mabe she's afraid to show that?I would at least be there for her and not pressure untill all this is done and behind you both...if you really care about her and she truely wants  this relationship,why riun a good thing?Give her some space.Mabe that's all she needs,to know that you care and are willing to stick by her.|`|AA10038219	IT COULD JUST BE THE STRESS FROM THE CUSTODY BATTLE TRY AND WAIT IT OUT BUT IF IT GETS TO HARD FOR YOU JUST END THE RELATIONSHIP AND TELL HER YOU WILL BE THERE FOR HER ONCE SHE GETS HER LIFE IN ORDER|`|0d08720d0030c29672b7608f0f970575aa	OKAY LET ME JUST CLEAR SOMETHING UP FOR YOU.  SHE'S SO NOT USING YOU CUZ YOU MAKE HER LOOK GOOD IN COURT.  GET A GRIP.  I DON'T CARE WHAT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE WITH HER SON.  DOESN'T MATTER. IF THE OTHER PARTY WANTS TO THEY CAN USE YOU TO SCREW UP HER CASE IF ANYTHING.  I MEAN GEEZ.    I'M KINDA UPSET CUZ OF THAT COMMENT REALLY.  DUDE HER CHILD IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A GUY.  AND IT'S A GOOD THING SHE THINKS THAT WAY. NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER CHILD.  AND SHE'S DOING GOOD BY CONCENTRATING ON THAT.      YOU REALLY NEED TO GIVE HER TIME, IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR HER, IF YOU DON'T WELL THEN JUST LEAVE.  SHE ALREADY HAS ENOUGH ON HER PLATE WITHOUT ADDING YOUR INSECURITIES.    MAYBE SHE'S SO STRESSED OUT SHE'S POSSIBLY NOT IN THE MOOD FOR SEX. HUH?  A POSSIBILITY.  I'D SAY SO.  I KINDA THINK YOU SHOULD MOVE ON.  YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE STAMINA TO WAIT THIS LENGHTY PROCESS OUT.  GO, MOVE ON, FIND HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE AND MAKE SURE IT'S WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN.  GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF YOU.|`|AA12048147	like any one on here can give you an answer on that !! you know her better than we do..... what is your heart telling you ? Do you love her and are you willing to wait till she is ready is the question ?  it sounds like it is a very stressing situation...... she has the fear of loosing her child...... do you blame her ?? and I do not think her dating you is a help or a hindrance as far as the custody battle goes....... a judge is NOT gonna look at you and say , * well she is dating this guy so it makes her a great mom*, geeeeee , get real....... sorry...... anyway, you have a decision to make......... God bless|`|AA11110297	She's not ready for a committed relationship --- she's in a custody battle and has enough stress from all that.... what she needs is a real friend who'll support her emotionally and not make any romantic demands on her....|`|03ede4c9444e0fc833bdfd03bc1505caaa	To tell you the truth I wont say shes being distant because of her work or custody battle but i will say if she really cared about you she would atleast talk to you about what is going on and how she feels if she wont give you the time of day then maybe you should consider other options... but talk with her first if she blows you off get out of it
tCiVuFK9aa	I think we all go through spurts of feeling that way.  Maybe you are not getting the arousal from your husband because he doesn't know what to do to please you.  Do you know what to do to please you?  If your answer is no, you need to go see a therapist.  I did when I was younger and he helped me to learn what sexually aroused me and how to show my husband.  We've had a great sex life since.  |`|UspK4SQBaa	Please see a sex therapist or marriage counselor.  It's fine to "just lay there" every once in awhile, but you shouldn't make a habit of it.  The fact that he gets angry only makes it worse.  Most men would not want to have sex f the woman is not interested.  Is there not enough foreplay?  Are you feeling ill? Tired?  Depressed?  These issues need to be resolved if you ever expect to get your libido back.  Also, stop having sex when you're not interested, but you need to figure out why you aren't so you can help your marriage.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	women hit their peak at 30 men hit their peak at 20 so it's normal!     but sometimes i'm not in the mood and well i would say about 25% of teh time when i'm not in the mood i'll do it!     sometiems i'm just too tired to do it!  but i still want it!   but i'm apparching my peak! :)  |`|77ZVd5hyaa	I always want to and it better remain that way for the two of us.|`|AA11376721	I am 22 and I am having the same exact problem with my husband. I am never in the mood anymore and I can't figure out why. I can't make myself do it for him either. What helps me is trying as hard as you can to make yourself want him. Watching porn sometimes works if you're into that. Foreplay always works. Find what makes you horny and ask him to do it. Trust me...it works. He should be understanding. |`|F0uLexezaa	why do you only ask that question of women? men also have to "perform" even when they don't want to|`|f4nfRv2xaa	ask urself what makes U most comfortable & go fr there|`|3YYgdNj0aa	Yes, because I love him and want to meet his needs.  I feel free though to say, 'Not to-night dear."    Once you co-operate , you usually find you are interested. :)    You're very young to feel this way about sex with your husband.  I'm 60 so have an excuse.:)  Are you stressed out or overworking?  You might want to talk to a doctor.    PS  A man can satisfy himself too. It's not all my job.|`|wpVSkvjkaa	Yes because he has a higher sex drive than I do.......so sometimes I do when I don't feel like it......because I love him.|`|F5IcNScMaa	No she never does and that's why i have a little on the side action.      Hold out on him and it's the flip of a coin on how he will retaliate that's just a fact |`|lbpc3D1laa	Yes, I have that problem from time to time, and yes, my husband is also very,.extremely...sexually active.  I'm just honest with my husband and tell him that I'm not in the mood. Some may argue that you need to sacrifice and do it even if you don't want to do it to keep your husband from cheating. I think that BS. If you are not in the mood, and there is nothing that your husband can do to get you in the mood, than you should not do it. It's not fair to him if your heart isn't in it.   There have been occassions that I take a small drink to get me in the mood, but sometimes that backfires. |`|AA11327878	i am w/u.  the only thing that i have on my side is that we have 5 kids and are constantly on the go.  so i have no time to even think about sex and when i start relaxing i don't think about anything but not for my husband.  s3x is always on his mind.  but i do give in for the most part but there are time that we will get in a fight because i don't want to or i am just really exhausted.    this problem wont go away you just have to learn how to handle the situation give in for the most part and don't let it bother you when he gets mad.  we should get mad at them for not recongizing our emotional needs|`|ndVFMJbuaa	I wouldn't like my wife to do it with me unless she was in the mood too, it'd be like playing baseball by yourself, what's the point? Sex isn't a one-player game. |`|7a9908c7c0672028e9909277215f94ebaa	First, you're not the one with the problem. Your husband needs to know you're not a sex machine!, and maybe if he'd lighten up, and not get mad at you when you don't want to have sex, you might actually want to have sex with him(if that makes sense) When we're angry, sex is the last thing we want to have with the person that is making us angry! I once heard it said that men think about sex ALL the time, and if they say they don't, they're lying. It's their basic animal instint.. Us ladies got all the brains ;-) But no, you're not alone in this, so don't feel bad.|`|L9iZUjDIaa	My girlfriend does she has been married 20 years and she absolutely dreads it now.  I seriously think she will go off the deep end because of it.|`|bdptdIGraa	What happens when you are selfish and only want it when you are in the mood is that he will start doing the same (rejecting you when you are in the mood but he's not) you guys will end up having sex every two months and none eventually.    I think is all about getting in the mood when your spouse wants it.|`|HljVnrFYaa	I tend to run into that issue a lot. my hubby could have sex all day every day. lol. and i just don't want to sometimes. i never do it if i really don't want to but most the time i let him start messing around with me until i get in the mood. never underestimate the power of foreplay.|`|bOw6V6Oiaa	i on the other hand have the opposite problem.|`|XB8Amgelaa	ya.|`|REVgMondaa	To keep ur husband from getting somewhere else.. Trust me happened in 1st marriage cause I couldn't have sex due to health probs it hurt severely @ times. plus he only thought with 1 head and not the one on his shoulders.. But if you explain to your husband what is going on and if he loves you like you sound like you love him then everything should be fine that is how it works now in my second marriage obviously this 1 does really love me.. so good luck!!|`|AA11277519	A normal males body produces 20 times more testosterone than a females. In other words, a male feels the same way after one day without sex as a female after 20 days without sex. A male that has not had sex in 20 days feels the same way as a female after more than a year without sex.    Knowing this simple difference, you can already understand the pain of the opposite gender. Its NOT their fault: they are made this way! Its in our genes! This is the reason why men are men and women are women. Men and women are DIFFERENT. Not better or worse, just different.    That said, I tell my husband "not right now" and do NOT let his subsequent pouting get the best of me. I have to IGNORE his frustration, 'coz eventually he WILL get over it. That's the key: learn how to truly ignore/dismiss/not care about his getting mad after you say no, and you won't feel bad about saying it.|`|PbwCVPL1aa	I just lay there untill it's over, and pretend I like it. Cuz I never want it.|`|TkSY2ZUfaa	When i really don't want to I'll offer a HJ or BJ, but if he really wants the whole package he usually knows how to get me in the mood :)    Marriage is about making sacrifices for one another, so if I am sleepy or whatever I'll make an extra effort to please him, because I love him.|`|qKGWeMK2aa	Men in general are usually more horny...My husband is and he says it's because I'm so damn sexy :)  I don't have sex when I'm not in the mood (which is rare at 30 years young)..and if he is and I'm not then I will pleasure him in anyway...Because my rule of thumb is that it's not his fault if I'm not 'in the mood' every waking moment so why should he suffer?....  I wish women wouldn't use the we have kids excuse tho like I hear some of my friends say...My husband and I have a 9 month old boy and we had sex during pregnancy, after and now...I guess when you're truly in love you have lots of sex...I know my grandparents did...|`|mh6ufmf9aa	I think you need to start paying attention to your man more and showing him that you are sexually attracted to him. Most women once they have kids and have been with their partners for a while just start seeing their partner as a good looking friend but forget that they are men that have this innate desire to please us sexually. If you are not feeling sexy try out new things. Put on some lippy, buy new lingerie, or buy a sexual toy if you're into that, and when you're child isn't watching.. just go for it.. be naughty! Whatever it is just try it and dedicate 1 hour a couple of times a week to having sex or just bonding sexually with your partner. You don't need to let him know you're plans because then he might think this whole thing is too structured, just try to show him that you still desire him sexually because he might start looking elsewhere if you both do not fulfil this basic need. And it is easy, men are very simple creatures :). Try to do it for me but remember you need to feel good about yourself first and get into it, because he'll know if you're not. Most likely you will re-connect with your body and start feeling sexier and more positive about sex.
sr7jX2wYaa	Sorry I was  going to  try & help , but  your  questions  are private, so I could not see the previous  question to use as a reference to answer this one. Hope someone  read it & remembers it , You realize how many people ask questions  on  this  site in this  section?*
AA10404395	It sounds to me like he's confused.  Worst case, he's lying to you or at least not giving you the whole truth.  Speak candidly with him, find out the entire story and make a connection with him!  How does he really feel about you?  When he answers, do you believe him?  Listen to your instincts!|`|e081ff064b692f928b7acd90148f8235aa	youre saying this guy liked being raped?? sounds like to me this guy needs to get some mental help to deal with the rape.   but as far as if he likes you or not, i guess you'll just have to feel that one out. he could still like you and be attracted to you sexually and still like having a man inside him too. then again, theres always toys you could use on him if he just likes the feeling of something inside him. but he needs to figure out if he just likes that feeling, or if he's turned on by being overpowered as he was in the rape. some straight men--even tho they might not openly admit it-- like their prostate stimulated, which is in the rectum, but theyre not gay. theyd never sleep with a man, but if they can get the girl to finger them/ play with some toys, etc, thats enough.   and btw, their orgasm is stronger thru prostate stimulation than just "normal" sex. Kinda like a g-spot orgasm is stronger for a woman than just normal stimulation.  seriously tho, your boy needs to talk to someone about the rape.|`|AA12048147	you need to back off from this situation.... he sounds very confused and tainted.... not his fault, not at all !!! rape is an ugly thing that is all about control on the rapist part, and lives are ruined for a long time after..... this poor guy needs to come to terms with it and seel help to find out just who and what he is...... being friends is more than ok...... but he really needs to get himself lined out before going anywhere else...... God bless|`|AA11638305	I imagine that he is very confused right now.  If he has not gotten help from a counselor because of the rape, he needs to talk to someone about the way he is feeling now.    The best thing you can do right now is to be his friend and support him but until he is no longer confused about where he stands, it is better for you to seek out someone else who is not confused about his sexuality.    Good Luck!|`|fb24e0ee609de2a9044b0996ac93621eaa	This boy needs to go to a rape crisis centre.    This is not the time to decide whether he is gay/bi/straight. He needs to get help with the trauma he has gone through.    Oh, and keep loving him, by all means, but it's probably in both of your best interests to keep that platonic, at least while he heals from this.|`|5736c291405894f0efc97f39b7f645deaa	I pity that guy.    Tell him this: It doesn't mean that being raped by a guy means he is gay. Ask him if he feels aroused when he sees naked guys. Unless you can prove that, he isn't gay. At least he is turned on my naked women, right>    By the way, naked women doesn't turn me on, So I know I am pure gay. Haha! =p

HL4DggdTaa	blimey, that's a really hard one. I am exactly the same age and have a bezzie a bit like that but it seems you two really shared something special. Maybe you should risk being made a fool of for this. It will not defiantly end that way and is your friendship is how you have claimed it then she will not throw away a chance to get it back. Just try and bring up a conversation. Don't say things like 'do you remember when...' because that will come across as a desperate attempt. What is it that she did for you two to break up? if you don't mind me asking. It sounds like you should really try to make this work and if she is reluctant to put in the effort then you would have to accept it will not come back but at least you could look back and know you tried!!

Don't mind if they don't answer or look funny, just ignore that until you get the hang of it.|`|Tp2VuKzeaa	Why dont you bring in some sweets and hand them out to all your classmates at the end of the day, like a welcoming gift or something.  You will become popular. :)|`|7dPwXcItaa	Just talk to girls tht seem nice then ask if you can hang with them, plz awnser mine : http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|aA8qw6Dgaa	Yes, Us at 'YahooAnswers' can always help you with very helpful answers that solve your problem.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just be yourself, have a great personality, a good smile and respect your peers including the jerks.  If you do that all of the above, you are most likely to have good friends, but be careful because they can take advantage of your kindness.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	i was in the same boat as you at one stage. what i did was get really **** faced with some people from my new school and hook up with one of the girls after that they loved me.     NB this probably won't work for anyone else. i was just a special case.|`|aaBWUx7Iaa	relax there r always new thing in life and there will be many more coming your way if some1 can help you in this its ur self ..talk to them share ur interest this world is full of topics go out spend time with then u will sure be having many friends by the end of this week :)  Best of Luck|`|HLmdbcFzaa	You could try sleeping with all the boys/girls?

Rome wasn't built in a day!|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Focus on other people (learning more about them, being interested in them, helping them out, that they might enjoy going somewhere with you), rather than on yourself (that you're lonely, that you're interesting, that you might enjoy doing something if someone goes with you, etc.)    Also, don't hold yourself back based on fear/worry/shyness.  Be open, when people talk to you and whatnot.|`|dU5RD79Paa	In your new school, to whoever you want to make friends with, first roam with them, then whatever they say you agree to eat, if you don't agree to it, just agree in front of them.

Also, just be friendly, not fake, friendly, and smile:) it makes you more approachable.

uzTUspgLaa	honestly, if he's not texting back, and ignoring her, i'd say she should move on. there are alot more guys and i'm sure alot of them would treat her better and give her the attention she needs. but then again i cant really talk much, i'm a 21 year old soldier deployed in iraq trying to get over my "girl" cheating on me with my best friend. so yeah.. anyways if either of you'd like to chat email me at rrunge777@yahoo.com =)|`|XPbwSSoaaa	he might just be playing hard to get!! so she shouldn't look for him. Let him get in touch.That way she will be able to tell if he really likes her. If he does get in touch then definitely he likes her but if he keeps quiet then she should just move on it is not worth the while!!!  tell her to mix and socialize with people more than ever before so that she doesnt get to think of this guy!!! and maybe she will meet a better guy !!  ADVICE:::MEN SHOULD DO THE CHASING do not chase them!!!!::::  good luck|`|19TSkwaKaa	Its not the end of the world.  Get them to move onif he doesnt liek her anymore  Hes probably jsut bored of texting and wants some action!!!|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Relax. Accidents happen all the time. Phones break, chargers get lost, even the phones get lost. Ring up the phone or his house phone. Or go and see him. And just ask simply have you lost your phone as I tried to text you? See easy right?  Raych|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Whats a fringeit. Is that like a hobbit or something?
xCjUEiB3aa	Hey hun.<br>  Im almost in the same situation where my boyfriend now and then texts his ex...Honestly i dont think its TOO MUCH OF A BIG DEAL but it is to me cuz im a VERy jealous girlfriend. I mean i would probably cry my eyes out the same way you did but u know what think of it this way your boyfriend is with YOU and not her. SCREW HER she's not worth you crying over...Your boyfriend is just being a little sorry to say immature TEXTING her now and then i dont think ex's should be friends. I would honestly say dont worry if you need anything Email me :)<br>  <br>  GOODLUCKKK AND DONT WASTE YOUR TEARS ON THAT GIRL!<br>  YOUR BOYFRIEND LOVES YOU!!|`|ec9c35855e277d5525cc9446acda7f92aa	You can only control yourself and no one else -- even though you are obviously endeavoring to control your BF and his X.  <br>  <br>  Get your life together!<br>  <br>  HTH.|`|5oTxOJocaa	Both. You are slightly over-reacting about the fact that they're texting each other, but your guy seems a little immature.|`|DYbABQARaa	you have every right to be upset i don't think your overreacting in fact i would react the same way|`|e9UESKFJaa	I think its a lil bit of overreaction,he probably didnt text back because he didnt wwant to hurt her feelings by saying no (:|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	I think you have a right to be upset, especially if he refused to text her back saying "No, I don't, I love my current girlfriend." I mean, it's not hard. You wouldn't be texting your ex-boyfriend stuff like that, so he shouldn't be doing that either. He needs to have evidence to support himself when he says "don't worry," because his actions don't match what he's telling you. He might not realize that he may be leading his ex on by not telling her flat out he isn't interested. And if you confront him about this, make sure to have arguments against why you're not just a "dumb girl," or why you're over-reacting. I mean, him not texting her back with a "no" seems like a pretty good reason to be upset, especially if he didn't specifically explain himself. Good luck|`|87XILDVBaa	You are not overreacting. When she asked him that question "do you wish we were still together" he should have responded by telling her what he claims to you "that you are the only one for him." If this is true, then he should have no problem telling her that. He sounds like he is playing games with both of you girls. Actions and words must match up in a relationship. Good luck honey!|`|BXe211Fvaa	You are not. I would've gone bzurk on him.<br>  Having conversations like that with an EX?! EFF NO.<br>  Tell him to drop her or you'll drop him. Gotta be a little more tough with guys. Otherwise their just gonna see you're very vulnerable and take advantage of that. He probably loves making you jealous. The thought that you cry over him makes him feel wanted. Gives him a confidence boost. You know what I'm sayin? Don't let it happen.<br>  You're getting mad/sad for a reason. If there wasn't a good reason then you would be okay with them talking a lil.  But you do have a reason, their over there flirting through texts and you're over there thinking you're exaggerating. You are not.<br>  Girl you better do somethin about thisss.
hBr3nfaIaa	Nono! Don't stop texting him at all.  He's probably shy&is waiting for you to do something.  I know everyone says wait for the guy to make the moves but that's silly.   Guys need to know a girl likes them too.  If he texts you then he must wanna talk.    Just say in one of your texts 'we should talk next time I see you[:' kinda thing, then he might feel confident enough to look up. At least then you can go over to him and it won't seem random,  This kinda thing always works for me :P      Good luck[:|`|q4MTwvXxaa	stop answering his text. guys can get confusing somethimes and we can go crazy trying to figure out why...trust me, i know..but dont worry about that. if you dont answer his text, he will realized something is wrong and if he cares he will make an attempt to use another form of contact to figure out what happened. Just be strong about this and if he is a good guy, he will come around...or if you feel that he is mature enough, you can just confront him and ask him what the deal is...|`|IEVwBt24aa	i have the same problem! this guy likes me so much and is asking if i'll be with him a month now . i like him but he isn't serious cause he ignores me in school . the only way we comunicate is threw mobile phone and msn so i'm sick of it too + i'm not over my first love. this hurts so much and i'm crying everyday cause of all these problems . 6 guys want to be with me but none of them are like my first love . so i'm telling you . if you like this guy really much go to him and talk about your relationship cause one day you'll be sorry for  the things you didnt done !!!|`|KguUQ9WWaa	He's bring immature babe :/. Why don't you say to him "how come you never talk to me at school?" If after that he doesn't bother, then leave it. Maybe in a year or so he'll mature a bit and get a bit less shy around you. It could be that he's thinking EXACTLY the same thing as you. Just be honest with him, and yourself and everything will be fine :)  Good luck hun!  xxx|`|ks2oieV0aa	I don't blame you, I wouldn't want a texting relationship either!  Try talking to him.  If it doesn't get any better, just move on.  xox|`|moeaIZB9aa	?|`|ruczpWrGaa	try talking to him once.  You may be surprised.  My boyfriends daughter went thru something similar.  They just celebrated being together for a year.  Try to talk to him.  If he still wants to act like he doesnt know you face to face then move on.|`|80npJDM2aa	any man that wants to keep communication private and censored from the general public (ie not hanging out with you) is a scum bag...you need to be with someone who is equally fair in treating you right in public.|`|uDkXHaa6aa	I think its strange he doesnt talk to you at school or even give you eye contact. I think it could be one of two things. 1.) He could be a very shy guy and talking to someone through text is very easy and you feel at ease saying things that are hard face to face and he is intimidated to make the move in person. OR 2.) There is the possibility its not him texting you but someone else maybe playing a joke? Either way I think you should approach him at school and just say hey whats up and start a conversation with him you can take his response to you at that point and evaluate what you should do next if he seems happy and relived then he was just nervous maybe bring up a topic you have discussed via text. But if he his not willing after that to talk with you while at school and only on text I would move on because that to me is not right. Good luck!!|`|YN9nRZQvaa	haha I like this question... kind of funny how you wrote everything out!      well just text him one more time like... "dude im tired of texting you! I wanna -**** not type!" Then he'll come and talk to you! haha|`|z3QsWmzpaa	you should text to him how come you never speak to me in skool and just see what he says but if he still doesnt speak to just ignore him and move on hes probably not worth waiting for =]|`|4tDTQOgNaa	Just leave him alone. Cause if the guy cant come to you directly and then act like you dont exist it's a problem. No you dont need to come to him. All this sounds like is game playing. Nothing serious.|`|Hw8P1to3aa	well maybe he's just really shy. if you do ever catch him looking at you, smile or wave and go over to talk to him. or maybe text him telling him how you feel, if that is the only way you guys can talk. if he isn't willing to speak to you face to face then he's not worth it. but give him a chance first.|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	chat with someone else in person and see if he glances if he dont hes not intrested.|`|6f5c461596d36223a4de1ff50d1fe3c1aa	Tell him your sick of texting him, and want to talk to him in person. If he won't.. then forget about him.|`|OQF6x5CDaa	go up to him and SPEAK to him.  because of texting, social skills are right down the crapper!  do NOT text him to ask him ANYTHING!  you'll be doing what you hate him doing.  if his response isnt what you want it to be-move on.  either hes shy or hiding behind texting for whatever reason.|`|TtfEmttXaa	There are three ways to look at it. He is either shy, is embarassed to have people see you talking to him or he's flirting secretly because he doesnt want other girls to know. Since I don't know him I can't answer for certain. So I'll let you answer in your head and I will tell you what to do based on each factor.    If he's shy. Be playful tell him to come to talk to you in real life and promise that you don't bite. This will give him confidence and also have him wanting more.    If it's any of the other reasons. Forget him. He will only hurt you in the end. He isn't worth your time.|`|gELUbPnAaa	talk to him about it...tell him the truth and that while you do have feelings for him, you can't keep wasting energy on a relationship like this.  he sounds super shy and so do you..maybe you two aren't ready for a relationship? sleep on it, don't be mad at him. do what feels right to you.|`|4459ubzsaa	one more time for fun then yes! ahah|`|lS15LB7Maa	tell him that its not   just a relationship were   yall just text tell him how you   feel and if he still doesnt talk  to you just forget him|`|ss8oeIDyaa	You should first ask him via text why he won't talk to you in person. Maybe he thinks that you are too shy or embarrassed of him to talk to him in person.  If he can't give you a good reason then this guy is a jerk and it is seriously time to move on.|`|Ryb4EOYsaa	maybe he doesnt know who you are maybe he just has ur number and know u on the inside but not the outside
AhwgLt8Taa	lol I am thinking this story is not real.  i looked at your other questions / answers and I don't think your 11.|`|AA11044659	Queer
AA10666196	yes definitely!! me and mine do it all the time. Watching him super turns me on! It's different than just having sex, develops a comfort zone in one another too |`|VoIzX7yBaa	Well not for competition, but why not allow more people in? We do it together alot. It is fun and hot to see. I love being there when she is driving herself crazy! and I like to do it for her too, We all enjoy doing it so why not. I do point out that we play with others to so it is just a part of our natural selves. It is quite neat participating in a mutual masturbation group session, which also includes masturbasting others. Great Fun!! DO IT! |`|Qv5CtneNaa	Yes, but best when the team is just two...like beach volleyball. Although I'd avoid competing in sand...yikes.     Try not to commit any penalties...those are brutal in this sport. |`|MMeyfqokaa	Sure, a few times.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Not usually.    Interesting concept though.|`|7ko9czaaaa	NO.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Team?    No.     As a couple, sure. Enjoy.    But not as an Olympic event.|`|H7hHCHRkaa	Yup, I think sex is way more personal.|`|F5IcNScMaa	Yeah it's called  circle jerking, when in a real marriage should be no need to do that.|`|AA11327878	for sure!!! but i would perfer to have someone else pleasuring me!!!  all tongue and vibrator baby!!!|`|6uLw65YQaa	Yup, have done it together and will continue to, it's fun!  Keeps some variety in the love life...|`|xEDnhoI2aa	 yep it gets lonely some times..and it helps to have help or watchers..|`|c2cTvAlqaa	There are just some nights when sex either isn't an option (thank you, Aunt Flo), and some nights I'm honestly just too tired for the actual act of sex and all the energy it takes to put into it. That makes for great fun with other alternatifves like you mentioned, though! |`|goaNob34aa	Yes, maybe some day you can compete in the Olympics and show your true athletic prowess.|`|e1658dd6f8cadd2baaecc6d6db216dfdaa	together, YES    Team sport  NO|`|DWEkHOAOaa	Absolutely, without a doubt, this is a great addition to a healthy love life. My wife and I enjoy this and have made it a part of our sexual activity. It has never completely taken the place of intercourse, just help "set the table". Talk to each other and learn how to please each other, this will enhance your oral sex life too!  Have fun!
LJ67klPraa	Maybe you should get rid of your husband....??    |`|rygLuXuqaa	You are having a mental and emotional affair with this guy through email, it is sometimes known as cheating.      How will karma of this come back to you?  Well, just tell your husband and you will find out.  Hopefully you dont have any kids so you can get a divorce with no strings attached.|`|6NNQZnsoaa	It won't! Black Cat...broken mirror...walk under a ladder. The fact is you are being stimulated by this email encounter. Your marriage is a sham and you need to be stimulated. Get ready....they are going to throw rocks and garbage at me for this answer....but it's pretty freakin true!|`|CPqyqBOqaa	Wow, you really need a divorce.|`|lSBWJA5Jaa	What do you mean by karma? Something like your husband is doing the same thing to you?  Sounds like if you're worried about cosmic payback then you are feeling a bit guilty about your virtual affair.   If you truly can't stand him then get out while you can. If you're just pissed off at him then talk to him about it. You'll never solve your marital problems with a closed mind and mouth.  Good luck!|`|EaJENrNxaa	If you can't stand the guy,  then why did you marry him? That's my first question. How does your husband feel about you? Have you even seen this guy you're emailing in person? He could very well be someone he says he isn't. I knew someone who took pictures of her clearly hotter cousin and used them to manipulate men. Then she would tell them when they wanted to meet her that she wasn't interested. But she would f**k them all day online.     There is no such thing as karma, but you do reap what you sow. Think of it this way, how would you react if your husband was doing what you are considering? I am one who believes in once married, always married. You took a vow before God, and the bible says it is better to not make the vow, then to make it and break it.|`|9K3kCCnaaa	Um. I say you need to either divorce your husband... Or get some counseling... What you are doing is wrong. It really makes me mad seeing people cheating on their spouse.... I mean hello! If your not happy divorce! duh!|`|sLLgERQWaa	well, how's about your 'wonderful' husband finding out about all the nasty stuff you two have been  e-mailing back and forth and either...  1) starts doing the same thing with some internet cutie pie in retaliation-what's good for the goose, so on.  2) It leads to an actual affair or  3 It ends up in divorce court, or both.......    So if ya can't stand the guy, well you married him, right? SO LEAVE!  ..and yes, Karma IS a big fat ole' "B"...you'll find out soon enough.|`|1I7Nu6zOaa	Karma may or may not get you back, but there is a saying that is true to life.  what goes around, comes around.  If you no longer love your husband, then talk to him and let him know how you feel, honestly you should not be involved (read married) to someone then pursuing another relationship.  It's unfair and gutless.  Sooner or later the men will find out about eachother, then things may not turn out so good for everyone involved.|`|UcezPQcjaa	Oh god, i giggled when i read the title of this message.    I thought the same thing ( did sort of the same thing )  And now im in the worst relationship ever with trust issues with him.    Just let the wind pass, do whatever you have to do to keep your wonderful husband. =]    Goodluck|`|LE0m4qqOaa	Why did you marry him?  If it is so bad then end it.  No need to suffer.  You do not mention any kids so it is not too difficult.  Aside from the fact if you do this you are committing adultery and if your husband finds out he can use it against you in court there is something else to consider.  This guys who is so happy to ***** your brains out may do more than that.  Be very careful.  |`|8bq6S19Oaa	I don't know much about karma, but basically what goes around comes around. Lets say you got of the marriage you are in and met someone you really liked/loved, the karma from what your doing now could mean your new guy cheats on you and you will feel misery. Thats pretty much how it works.  Why stay in a loveless marriage though? I mean it must be doing your head in, if it's not yet then it will eventually!  Good luck.|`|kaQ9EaAuaa	Yes you think you dislike your husband but wait until he finds a GOOD women, she will make you look like the trash u are|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	yes. it will bite your ***, take a big chunk out, bleed like crazy and leave a huge scabby dent. Yummy. Gee, how about it could END your marriage. why are you even staying if you can't stand him?|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u reap what u sow, when u hurt others, meaning your spouse, it always comes back to u, and sooner or later the truth is going to come out and u will be found out. what u do to hurt others, always comes back to u, one day u may really love a guy and he will betray u, this is how karma will come back to u.|`|AA11327878	if you aren't happy in your marriage then get the F out!!!  don't play those kind of games and yes karma will come back and bite your @$$ real hard!!!|`|2ikZxzBfaa	If you care your husband dont do it.A divorce is not worth the fling.Work things out with your husband.Have him      your brains out.|`|RD05jXYwaa	sense i hold the other side of your coin i don't know how to answer but i am interested in an answer. i know every relationship impacts all relationship (that is why i am not so good at them) bad begets bad good begets good and i don't give a **** begets............. tmm is that karma?|`|77ZVd5hyaa	I say good for you, enjoy the fun.
LxvA4vGpaa	Everyone posting is usually referencing a relationship that only has a 10, 15, or at most a 20 year age gap.  What you are asking is in reference to a 30+ year age gap.      With me, the age gap depends on where each person is in their life.  29 and 61?  No.  They are at different parts of their life.  One is just really starting to become their own person and starting their career, while the other is way past the starting line.  They have already been in the work world for over 30+ years and most likely even have grandkids, or at the very least, children the same age as the 29yr old.      When the age gap is less, it is more understandable.  More acceptable.   But you can't look at just the age in numbers, you have to look at it in a "maturity" and "life experience" way too.  For instance, I am 7 yrs younger than my husband.  I am 24, he is 31.  The age difference is fine for us, but I would flip a gasket if my 15 year old niece came home with a 22 year old man.  Now if they were to meet up again when she was 21 or 22, and he was 28 or 29, I would be ok with them dating.  Not because they are older, but because they are more than likely at the same "point" in life.  Both have (hopefully) finished college and have started their careers, both are ready to actually settle down, and both know themselves well enough to actually be involved in a relationship.      But no, a 29 yr old wanting a 61 yr old?   No way, Jose!  |`|o3xvqEkAaa	i think hes loaded|`|5ViTUTyZaa	I think it is OK.|`|ZkQiW0Foaa	She better make sure all of his equipment works before walking down the isle. |`|9106165ae84d53ee275469e1a89fc7e0aa	has he or she got money?

My sister thought it didn't matter, now she is 48 and her husband is 77 and the age differences really start to cause problems. I'd say think long and hard before taking it any further. |`|qfcS3louaa	I think it's a little weird. My father in law is 63 and I'm 25. That would be awkward!     I say, if they're old enough to be a parent or grandparent...then it's too old.     Do you want to be 40 yrs old with a 70 yr old husband? People will always assume he's your dad.       To each their own, you did ask my opinion! |`|Hfcm5fJCaa	I think it could work.    If he is the young at heart type then they could enjoy a very happy life together.  She is old enough to know what is good for her and also understand that 10 years from now their relationship might not be what it is today, should they get together.    |`|pZcyaNE3aa	its not right sorry|`|CLg9KA0Qaa	give it a chance.     you never know until you go out with him    you will get those "looks" but just brush them off    BUT if you're already asking this question,that shows you have a problem with it. |`|AA11439896	I think age is just a number and as long everyone is over legal age it's fine.    My husband is 18 years older than me and we have been together 15 10 years.  He is the greatest guy ever.|`|nICseecwaa	My answer is simple I am 58 and datiing a 34 yr old. Our sex is great and as far as I am concerned she is the love of my life. Age is useless. Love is the main concern, if there is love, affection, desire and commitment then who cares about a number|`|Llb3PvWbaa	If that's what you want then go for it.

Is it worth it?|`|4C9U3Xh6aa	Deep down inside No women trust thier husbands. We pretend to. There are to many women who dont care if men are married. You can only try to keep him faithful.

j45Q2ipRaa	Go to court as soon as you can.  Without court ordered visitation, you can't say no.  She is his mother for all it is worth.    There are several things you can do and some will show where here heart really is.    First, there needs to be an order of support if there isn't one and from what little you say there probably isn't.  If she loves this boy and really wants him in her life, she will agree to some support, even if minimal.    When you file for the support, file for the visitation schedule.     Unfortunately, you can't prevent the boy from seeing his mother since he is curious.  It would do more harm than good.      Once the visititation schedule is in place, if she keeps missing days and/or is causing emotional issues with the boy, then you can go for sole custody and work with a social worker to terminate her priviledges.    All the time, just remember to support the boy.  He is all that really matters in this situation.  Don't let him know how you feel about his mother as he isn't old enough to go through all of that.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	If he's been settled with you for that long then it's extremely unlikely that she could get custody or full joint custody. It really depends on what the mother and father both ask the judge for, usually parents will come to an agreement without the judge having to make a decision that one doesn't agree to but what she suggested - every other weekend - is quite a usual visitation arrangement for the non-resident parent. A judge might suggest that you start off without overnight visits until the mother and child know eachother a bit better though and if she does have unsuitable boyfriends or similar overnight visits should be avoided.    If there's a court order in place then you're not really allowed to cancel any visits she's entitled to, although people often do without many consequences. In an extreme case, if a judge thinks that you're getting in the way of the child seeing his mother at all then he could give the mother custody to avoid that, so always try to stick to any arrangements even if she's being difficult.|`|RzeYy8dTaa	She had abandon the child,now wants back in the picture.I'd go to court and have them set a visitation plan.They may not think she should have on.Who knows?But don't wait.

Good luck but get a court order asap or else she still has rights|`|OmqJmtrRaa	Firstly I am very sorry to read what you and the family are currently going through right now.    There is an innocent child in all of this and yes you have a right just like your partner to protect this child and do what is best for the child, but the is no clear and easy answer for situations like this.    I feel it is mostly important that this child has someone to talk to, letting him express what he really does wants, its hard for a child to talk openingly with a parent when it involves another parent, the is pressure to please the parent they are with....just with you saying the childs response has been blank, does he have a mentor inschool he can talk with over this?, he may or may not want to see this woman and its important he can talk through this.    I understand your concern and upset also, your a wonderful woman for bringing up this boy as your own and you should feel proud for that!,     The best thing you can do is get a list of local solicitors that deal with family matters, the law always changes in family law along with other laws but I am sure that you will get answers you need and the best routes to take with his/her support.    My daughter is 9 and her dad made contact when she was 8 years old, it destroyed me because I had attended to her every need on my own, sickness, tantrums ect and I felt angry that he just came along and rocked my daughters world, although my instant gut reaction was to protect her, I agreed to weekly letters being sent ect to see his cmmitement, as expected the letters faded out within a month and that was just 2 letters. Soon my daughter wanted to explore her dad and his family.  I decided to support her instead of being against the idea because it is no good for a child, you get further by supporting what decisions they make.    My daughter is now 10 and because she seen what her Dad was and that he never really did care, it was hard supporting her during this but it was far better tha me giving out allthe negatives I could have done.    I do wish you well and I hope you get things sorted soon, thoughts are with you xx

Marriages usually come with a contract which both partners must have to agree with before getting married. The contract disallows things like cheating and leaving the other partner without a good reason, which is more likely to happen in cohabiting couples, although in some peoples view this is not always the case. Furthermore, it also provideds safety for the children because their parents have decided to stay together in a more efficient and official way.     In addition to this, marriage is something traditional and has been present throughout time and still continues today. Lots of people in the world have a religion and in their religion cohabitation is not permitted therefore they must marry to be able to live and have a sexual relationship with another partner.

Here, the bestselling author of Suddenly Sixty and Necessary Losses presents her life-affirming perspective on the joys, heartaches, difficulties, and possibilities of a grown-up marriage  and no, that's not an oxymoron!    Featuring interviews with married women and men, the findings of couples therapists, the truths offered by literature and movies, and a bemused exploration of her own marriage, Judith Viorst illuminates the issues couples struggle with from "I do" through "till death do us part." Examining marital rivalry, marital manners, marital sex (extramarital, too), marital fighting and apologies, what kids do for (and to) marriage, and the boredom and bliss of everyday married life, Viorst leaves no marital stone unturned. From the early years when we wonder "Who is this person?" and "What am I doing here?" to the realities of divorce, remarriage, and growing older (and old) together, Viorst offers insights and advice with honesty, humanity, and humor  all the while recognizing how tough it is to be married and, when it works, how very precious it can be.    Chapter 1        The dread of loneliness is greater than the fear of bondage, so we get married.      Cyril Connolly, The Unquiet Grave    Most of the women of my generation probably married too young to have grown acquainted with the dread of loneliness. Most of us were taught, however, before we left our teens the dread of unmarriedness. One of my aunts, who remarkably got a Ph.D. in physics at a time when most of her peers went no further than high school, was perceived by my mother and father and other relatives as our family's tragic failure because she never achieved a husband and kids. Another of my aunts, who was seen as a lesser tragic failure because, although divorced, she at least had been married, was still an object of pity because she needed to earn her own living instead of being supported by a man. Earning a living was something a woman aspired to be relieved of. A solid middle-class marriage was a marriage in which a woman did not, thank God, have to go out and get a job.    So we married because, for a woman, there was no higher attainment. And we married to be taken care of financially. We also married in order to have safe sex, which  had we been pressed  we would have defined as sex that wouldn't make getting pregnant a vast catastrophe. We also  most of us  married to get pregnant and raise a family. Of course what we said was that we married for love.    As for the men who married us, why did they do it? Why in the late 1950s were men, at the average marrying age of twenty-three, in a rush to become our economic providers? Part of the answer, I think, is that they were brought up in a culture that equated becoming a man with settling down. Maybe no one whispered words like "breadwinner" or "responsible" in their ears, but most of them knew what they were supposed to do. "A young college-educated bourgeois male of my generation who scoffed at the idea of marriage for himself... laid himself open to the charge of 'immaturity'...," writes Philip Roth in My Life as a Man. "Or he was just plain 'selfish.' Or he was 'frightened of responsibility.' Or he could not 'commit himself'... to a 'permanent relationship.'"    And so these young men committed themselves, receiving in return the approval of society plus  very important  sex on a regular basis. Of course what they said was that they married for love.    We all meant it  well, most of us meant it  when we said we married for love, and we knew what kind of love that ought to be: Romantic love. And lustful love. And tender love. And giddy love. And you are my one true love, my destiny. And love-song love. And movie love. And happily-ever-after love. And baby, baby, you belong to me, so let the beguine begin because I've got you under my skin. Dreamy, steamy, now-and-forever love.    We all married  well, most of us married  for love, for some version of Sinatra and Casablanca love, for a love that would light up our lives and cast out fear, for a Romeo and Juliet love (except with a better ending), for a love that the poet John Donne once wrote "makes one little room an everywhere." And if our feelings were, as they doubtless were, a bit naive, a bit adolescent, I don't intend to disparage them, for there can surely be nothing sweeter than a man and a woman marrying for love.    And most of us did. But whether we consciously knew it or not, most of us also married  let's be honest here  for the sex, the kids, the security, the approval of our community, and marriage's other pragmatic benedictions. There were plenty of reasons to marry back in my day. But that was then. Why get married now?    Now that the state of unmarriedness isn't the disaster that it used to be. Now that women are raised to be economically independent, and actually want to go out and get a job. Now that unwed s|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Insecurity  religion  brainwashed  a lot of woman do it for the money  the only benefits in marriage are for woman|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	If you want to have a family life with a deep loving life partner & children for continuance of your chain of family in future. Marry soon before you reach 25. It is a simple thing to understand. It is natural that the moment one gets maturity, a boy needs a girl & vice versa, none can deny the fact & marriage is the most civilised way of having that in an organised manner.   Marriage has large number of advantages compared to living alone particularly for a girl. None can pass whole life alone smoothly without having even smallest possible tension without having any real deep loving  life partner. There is no better replacement of marriage. Only lengthy multi-step procedure based marriages involving a lot of pomp & show of few selected sections of societies make the system a big nuisance. If marriage procedures are simple as many do, it is a  very good thing.|`|2TiwAfPvaa	haha thats a damn good question nowdays...    work benefits?|`|1aFkPU7qaa	lol to have sons|`|RWLmOZzeaa	so when ur wife devorces you she can take all your money and your house... lol|`|eG53oROJaa	this question has plagued my existence.  my parents were divorced when i was young, and instead of focusing on raising the 2 children they created togetherthey remarried and made more kids.  as i was growing up i found i could rely on only myself and my brother so i really never desired to get married.  i found it pointless.  then i met Kurt, we had a mishap and got pregnant.  As soon as i began feeling maternal i wanted so badly to be married, to have that solid commitment and declare in front of our families that we were committed .  for our child.  we had this feeling that we needed to make it work for our kid and that was the reason (the only reason) for getting married, and 5 years into it we are still as much in love and as committed as day 1.    i guess what i'm saying is that the only good reason to get married is for children and the adults who have the children should be focused and determined to sacrifice small amounts of themselves so their children can grow up in a strong 2 parent home|`|2aab9990f44abc785cfb7c119b182bdeaa	to have free sex without paying even for room|`|jrqXRqqCaa	to consume SEX legally/i do marriage for convinience,and to have someone in cold lonely nights...|`|UZBULUuraa	I can only speak for myself.

A woman can be JUST AS controlling too but you rarely hear anyone in society say "its wrong to be a controlling woman".

RUN, run as fast as you can..... i think that they are beautiful because they spend so much time and effort making sure. which is a direct result of there insecurities. which means if they are not getting the attention of other men, then they are not happy. i found out and forgave my ex 4 times. after 5 years divorced, im finally over her. but it was her beauty not her! i have recently (6 months) met this woman who has showed me what love really is. she is not as HOT as my ex but i have never been in a better and happier place. she is more beautiful to me everyday!  my ex (just like yours) is still a mess... one relationship after another because she is never satisfied. im not sure, but i really hope i helped.|`|B1sT1t44aa	Beauty is only skin deep and I wonder if one of her affairs gave you a life threatening disease how you would see her then?|`|dm7gls1iaa	Ummmm you're only with her because she's hot?

You are saying that you are with her because she is HOT !! Not bad !!     I dont think i can answer this !!! Dumb !|`|N3ACzplNaa	I hope you see more to your wife than how hot she is.  You guys need some marriage counseling and if she wants this marriage she will go with you.  You can't base a marriage on how your wife looks.
sr7jX2wYaa	I found the best  way  is to do what you are doing & quit doing  things with that person, & find other  people to hang  out with. I know it sounds rude, but pretty soon she will ask have I done something to you, & then you be honest & say No not to me personally, but we just don't have as much in common as I thought , & It reflects on me when I am with you & you mistreat other  people. & I don't  want people thinking that is how I feel or think.I also like being around  people I have  things in common with & that we agree on.. So I figured the best way to handle it would be to not be around you sorry, but sometimes that is  the way of life*|`|ML4oQ8tuaa	be upfront with this person on how you feel but dont be overly angry or insulting about it. just tell this person calmly and respectfully how you feel and just say that you feel a mutual end to this friendship (or something along those lines) is best for the both of you.<br>  if this person does not react well, then this person is undeserving of a friendship even on a lesser scale that what you might have had.<br>  Good Luck
DRDdUhQ2aa	Sister,<br>  these feelings are perfectally normal,one solution for you is to try to find some work from home,there is a good website you can check out for that purpose  <a href="http://www.wahm.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.wahm.com.</a><br>  <br>  Women's rights are to stay at home,ignore the negative voices below,you have the right to maintain your domestic duties.|`|RgINbeNFaa	you're only being unreasonable if you want the same life your husband wants for your fam.

I have told my boyfriend the moment I met him how important a family is to me and that I will be a stay at home mom when the time comes. I'm sure if your husband has been at that job for a while now you twow ould survive with just his income! I mean if you have to work and he doesn't help out around the house either now, no way would that be happening. I don't trust babysitters at all and I am definitely beinga stay at home mom! That's final!|`|6a56c836d361c3eb479fddc9e9cb02e1aa	He is being unreasonable for not helping you at home.  You are being unreasonable to throw a temper tantrum for having to help provide for the family.  I started substitute teaching to help bring in money for the family.  The hours work for me.  You need to find something that helps out the family without compromising your family life.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	Is it possible to trim a little more away from the household budget?  Could you get the next round of kids' clothes from a second hand store or from relatives?  Can you buy everyone warm bathrobes and turn the thermostat down?

Yes, I think you are being unreasonable,.  Sorry that probably isn't what you wanted to hear but..<br>  <br>  Sometimes things don't work out like we plan.

How old is your daughter?  Things are great, but it's not everything!  You'll never have the time back with your child!  To me, it sounds like he has co-workers that have alot of material things or "status" that he wants.  I can understand that to an extent.  Why did you agree to go back to work without at least talking to him, telling him how you felt before you applied for a job?  I feel for you on the no help with the housework.  You need to sit down with him and talk to him.  Get all of your feelings out.  He's the main bread winner but you're not his other child.  He can help out with some things.  I hope it goes well for you!|`|AA11988503	Sounds like both of you need to change your attitudes. You need to realize that not every man makes enough money to support a home on his own and that you should contribute, and he needs to realize that housework is pretty much a full time job. I would say either you get a part-time job that allows you to be home in the afternoons (maybe work at your daughter's school?) or work from home. And as for your husband, he needs to figure out that if he can't work and do all the housework, neither can you. Maybe take some sort of "emergency trip" and leave him to do all the housework for a few days so he can understand exactly how much you do. Then maybe he'll be a little more sympathetic.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	In this economy honey sometimes it takes two people to make it. If you want to stay in the home you are accustomed to, or live the life that you are used to, you will have to make sacrifices sometimes for the best of everyone.<br>  Marriage is give and take. You should talk to him about how you're feeling. Tell if you feel as though working, housecleaning, taking care of your daughter, and doing all of the stuff you do now may be a heavy burden to carry yourself.<br>  Tell him that you need to him to help. If you refuses to help life doesn't have to be perfect. Let the house get a little messy, meals don't need made at exactly 5:30. You have to be flexible to make it work.<br>  I understand you wanting to be there to get your baby off the bus. It is natural to want to continue doing the things that you enjoy. Get a job at night if you have to. 11pm-7am isn't an easy schedule at times but, if you try to be flexible you can put your kid on the bus, take her off, and sleep while she's at school. If you work part time you can make it work. <br>  You need to try to understand your husband isn't doing this to make your life harder, he is most likely wanting you to contribute with money because you need it. <br>  Good luck with you and your family.|`|15d1Ig0Haa	You have to decide if his wants are something realistic or just selfishness. It would be a good ideal for you to do your homework by checking out the cost of after school care and how much money will actually have left over. Will it be worth it? Maybe he can apply for a higher paying job so that he can have more.<br>  <br>  It's easy for men to think their wives should go out and get a job  when they have  children but they fail to realize how much after school care cost, who's going to pick up the child up after school. Will he take off from work if your kid gets sick or during school holidays. Will he be wiling to pay for child care during the summer or help around the house since both of you will be work. These are things he needs to think about.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out well for you.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	while he should share some of the house work as we are no longer in the stone ages, i would say you seeing the state of the economy, you're upset at his level?? imagine if he didnt have a job, yeah you wanna see your daughter but he does also i would imagine. Things are bad you should both be working and doing home chores also..50 50 with house chores more on his end with regards to yard work an stuff. Why would you not want to work? isnt that what all the feminist groups are lobbying for the stereotype that women must stay at home? Be pro-active...more money always helps the family..boost your comfort zone and give you more financial independence also..good luck with ur interview though|`|k6mYgCBXaa	The problem, it seems to me, is not that your spouse doesn't make enough money but that too much of the monthly income is being spent on frivalous things which you don't consider to be a necessity.<br>  <br>  Tell your husband you are more than willling to get a job if there is indeed a real need for a second income, but tell him first you would like to figure out a budget and pin point what is being spent where. Make an itemized list of your spendings for the past 3 months. Look honestly at all the expendictures....Is there money being spent on junk food, fast food, morning latte's, etc...Devise a budget together. <br>  <br>  Remember, it is NOT how much you MAKE but how much you save that matters! Your husband may not be aware of the little expendictures that add up each month, those unecessary things you could both really live without. <br>  <br>  Figure out how much child care is likely to cost you and how much money you are likely to make working. Chances are it won't be worth it for you too go back to work. SHOW HIIM PROOF of this. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are going to be a stay at home mom and wife be a good stay at home wife and that means doing a good job for your family in your home....keep it clean, do all the laundry, plan healthy meals...In other words make HIS life easier each day, easier for him to go to work because you are home taking care of the bills, the chores, the phone calls and all the errands for the family. <br>  <br>  I am not saying this is true of you, but some women expect to sit home all day and watch soap operas and play with the children. That isnt a real parntership. Make sure he sees how VALUABLE you are at home....and if you two decide together that you need to work outside the home, let him know upfront you expect help with the household chores and you will NOT be responsbile for all that needs to be done in the home.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|l3Lw8tzqaa	First post had it right.  You can get a part time job to ensure that you'll be home when your kid gets back from school.<br>  <br>  Wanting to be a stay at home mom isn't a selfish thing; its a situation that will benefit your kid the most.  If you have an older child that spends all day at school, though, your child won't notice if you're away at work if you're still home when your kid gets there.<br>  <br>  Regarding your husband and your ill feelings toward him, where you aware of his earning potential when you married?  Does his training/education/field dictate that he should be making more money or be further along than he currently is?  Did you guys agree before you got married that you were going to be a stay at home mom?<br>  <br>  If you guys agreed that you'd be a stay at home mom before getting married then I would say that he's not holding his end of the bargain up.  But if this is a situation where you guys never laid those conditions out before having a kid, well, then you get what you get.<br>  <br>  For my part, I made sure that my wife would be okay with being a stay at home mother before I married her because I didn't want to stick my kid in day care.  I'm lucky enough that I have a job that allows me to provide that for my family without too much struggle.  Even if I wasn't in this position, though, I'd still do everything in my power to make sure my wife could stay at home with our child, including working multiple jobs and living in an apartment versus our house, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  The catch usually is that you're allowed to be a little put out if you guys agreed on this stuff before you got married.  If you're only figuring it out now, though, you don't have a whole lot of ground to be angry.|`|GWQwsH1Baa	I do not think you are selfish....I do not know one mom that wouldn't like to stay at home...I have recently lost my job. But about 7 months ago I started a home-based business that has really started paying off...to be honest I was not putting a whole lot of effort until the last couple of weeks (I just had my first child). Maybe you could do that....here is a list of my sites...check them out and let me know if you have any questions:<br>  www.freedomathome.com/rlippolis<br>  www.myhomebusinesspays.com/rlippolis|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	If your child is in school why would you not work?<br>  <br>  I am a single mother with a career, two children & a clean house...It can be done.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Very much so.<br>  <br>  He should help with the housework and if he refuses to, then stop cleaning his clothes or making his meals, but aside from that, who are you to want to be taken care of? That is YOUR responsibility.|`|ogdm7RLYaa	Put your daughter (and yourself) before your husband. Your daughter deserves a stable lifestyle i.e. her mommy with her at all times. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would tell HIM to get a second job if he wants extravagances.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Yes You are and get a part Time Job that way you are Working and have Plenty of time for home|`|KRE5oflKaa	Okay, first of all I dont think you are one bit selfish. I think staying home with your child is the most important thing we can do.  You never hear of people saying they wished they worked more.  Its always the opposite.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, I dont think you should work outside your home because he wants golf clubs or unnecessary things.  If push comes to shove and he is still being selfish, why not open a day care in your home?<br>  <br>  We needed the extra money because we got into dept and I didnt want to work outside my home anymore because my kids are more important so I opened a home day care and make more than what I did working full time outside.  ITs so much better and I can homeschool.  My kids are only 3 and 4 and they will tell you they like it more when Mommy is home.  That and they love having other kids to play with.  I can still do house work, cook and care for my kids...all while earning $500 a week.|`|Wv592rOqaa	You are only being unreasonable if you feel like you have to do everything by yourself.  Today's modern family dictates that there are no longer and gender only tasks.  <br>  <br>  I also understand how you feel about going back to work and not being there for your child, but the economy sucks and helping out financially is expected.  However, the deal would be - I go to work outside the home and you help with work inside the home - or I'm better off staying home because he should not expect you to handle everything along with working outside the home.  <br>  <br>  Tell him "you're not his super woman" - you are his wife.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	I mean do you have enough money to live comfortably? If you do not then go out and get a job of some kind. Part time of full time and do not blame him. I can see how you wanna stay home with your daughter but that is not always possible. Especially with the way the economy is lately. <br>  Good Luck|`|x3LclBZ0aa	at this day and age, especially with how the economy is, you shouldnt have an issue about working and helping support the family financially. as far as housework and chores, talk with your husband about sharing responsibilities.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Yes, stop being so selfish.|`|2KC467tFaa	A bit. I understand why you want to stay at home and raise your daughter, but remember that you are a team. You help each other out. Just because you have to help with the income, doesn't mean you have to work forever. Have you thought about watching children during the day? Maybe you could start baking organic desserts and sell them to local health food stores. There are unlimited jobs you can have from your home. You would still be able to raise your daughter and bring in some money. Either way, I would talk to your husband. Don't make demands, but requests are definitely ok. Explain that because both of you are sharing work outside the house, you think you should also share housework. It's only fair. Best of luck to you!|`|4cbcdee11cb3c61a098a2a21a3d1b3b7aa	Questions like yours only arise when two people get married without first planning and drafting an understanding.<br>  <br>  However, it depends on which direction you look at your problem. I believe a wife is entitled to decide whether she wants to be a stay at home mom or pursue a career, when there are children involved.<br>  <br>  But, in today's society where women make up 60% of the work force, it's quite normal for men to expect their wives to help with support. In return men must step up their role in household and parental duties, from cooking and cleaning, to shopping and laundry. <br>  <br>  p.s. Me and my girl work full time, I cooked last night while she shoveled the snow. Marriage require two people working in unison.|`|RvFwmQOPaa	You both need to compromise. It takes two incomes to succeed in today's economical struggle and any help that you provide will help your family in the long run. You must be living under a rock to not see what's going on in the world. Your husband is lucky enough to have a job! He has to also understand that if you go back to work that he needs to help out more around the house with chores and your daughter. Try gettign a job that will allow you to be home when your daughter gets home. As for resenting him, I don't think that that is fair. He's provided you the oppurtunity to stay home and now he's seeking your help. You're part of the family too and you can do your part in helping fiancially.You're sounding very selfish.|`|TKZAYJokaa	have you considered doing babysitting for a family member or applying for a daycare license? this is what i did so that i could stay home with my kids. I make only about $200 a week watching 2 kids but it helps him out....(he gets about $700 a week being asbestos supervisor) and we are doing fine with rent ($775) and bills. in fact i even manage to pay my girls dance/gymnastics of $130 a month!<br>  <br>  edit: sounds like he is making anough to support you tho...have you tried asking him to let you be a sahm, and you will not have second car, soend way less on frivolities, and start pinching dollars, cheaper grocery shoppings for instance and cheaper cable ect???
AA10285930	I feel soooo sorry for your friend...I was married to a man that was a cheater & was played for such a fool...I heard all the excuses of why he did this to me & all the reasons that he would never do it again to me...I fell for them all for a long time until 1 day I realised that the same excuses were just being used over & over again....For the man or any one who is the cheater it is a game of cat & mouse...But when the truth comes out your friend will be the 1 on the loosing end with him...All I can say is be her friend thru thick & thin but you also need to be able to speak your feelings on this...If she is a true friend of yours she will accept your views & respect them whether she likes the answers or not...GOOD LUCK !!!!|`|AA11405195	I don't think the question should be how do you feel about your husband cheating, however, how does it feel as a Married woman to know that your best friend is sleeping with someone's husband. The first thought that comes to my mind is that she could be doing the same thing to me. I think you should remind her that marriage is committment between a husband, wife, and God and she has no place in it.  She is committing a sin each time she is with this man and really does she think his going to leave his wife for her and even if he does he will more than likely cheat on her.|`|AA11081090	tell her to move on to someone available this wont work out well for her in any manner    Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|AA11110297	tell her to keep her personal business to herself.|`|AA11424108	It would be crushing to learn my husband was cheating on me.

Try out nre things, get drunk and have wild sex!|`|RuV7l2tAaa	Why not try being a little romantic to get him into the mood? Try doing things that will turn his interest on you to get rid whatever is on his mind :). An example would be waiting for him to get home from something (like work) and surprise him by waiting in the bedroom with your sexiest clothing (or lack thereof). This would work for me (and it has). :) Good luck!|`|lGSUToFQaa	never give up that easily, but if you tell him what to do does it make it romantic, i can tell my hubby i want flowers for valentines day, but when he shows up in july with 2 dozen calla lilies it's romantic because it's him doing it, but never give up, talk to him, tell him how you feel, try working with him, toys, counseling, etc. maybe he's scared of not pleasing you, talk to him about it, work with him a little, get toys, go to counseling. some times in a marriage you give more than you get, other times you take more than you give but it's till death do you part, not till he gets fat or ugly or bald or mean or drunk with his friends and forgot your anniversary, it's till death do you part it's a lifetime commitment, it's serious. good luck|`|kFcdwVwdaa	if i may, how long have you been with him? its really hard to get divorced, it cost money, and its a headache. its not as simple as being a couple. maybe he thinks that you are too boring, have you tried being more sexy? not you physically but i mean, the sexy outfits, tryin to satisfy his fantasies, more foreplay "head". sometimes it takes some guys this to get going. if he doesn't go for it then im sorry but you do have to go through the headache. good luck ok|`|x3EPqezJaa	If he's willing to work with you on it, then stay with him. If he won't work with you on this, then leave. I have to say, though, if he's not showing interest as a newlywed, he likely never will... unless he has a problem sexually he's not telling you about.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	There will be times when you're sex life is great and other times when one or the other gets bored. I guess it will get better. Maybe you should try new positions, new places, try getting  romantic first, have some drinks.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Passionate sex is something I will never try to workout.  The beauty of it is its original form.   I cannot imagine myself telling  my husband "you have to buy me roses, a bottle of wine and then make love to me all night, or else".....All essense is lost in the process.  Intimacy is twins with spontaneity.  Unless he is over 45, diabetic, has a drinking problem, or a drug user, there should not be a reason why this uninterest in sex with you.    Speak to him and be very bald, insist he tells you the truth, either he does not love you or he is gay.   But get it out of him at any cost.|`|23e0860d0b53493506c96a5edac4e09eaa	Definitely don't give up that easily!  First of all, don't beg any man to be more romantic!  The more you plead with him, the more of a turnoff it is for him.  Is he working alot of hours?  Is something else taking up alot of time?  Don't give up!!  Just keeping flirting with him, but don't mention sex.  There was something that attracted you to him or you both wouldn't have gotten married!  Give him some time!!  Take it from me!  I have been married 7 years.  The more you seem like you're not interested, the more it will perk his!  I wish you well!!|`|RgINbeNFaa	Wow you say leave like its a part time job.  And we wonder why marriages don't last.  Because so 'n' so's (you are included) don't feel like putting in work.  a marriage isn't 50/50.  you put your 100% in and he does the same.  any overtime should go towards something positive in the relationship.  Women forget that romance is a two way street.  I'm sure you've tried the romance thing, but just because you are a girl doesn't mean you know what you are doing.  Romance for a guy isnt as simple as you think.  If he doesn't respond to your advances your doing it worng.  Let me explain more clearly.  If he bought you a vacuum cleaner for your anniversery as a romantic gesture, how would you react.  I doubt you would fall to your knees and serve your man up.  You can't leave because YOU don't get what you want.|`|DntzRXczaa	work with him for a bit but if he doesn't get off the pot and give you what you need you need to talk to him about it and if you can't get what you need from him as hard as it is move on.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Its too soon to give up! You need to make it romantic and make him want it. Cook dinner in a sexy outfit with high heels. And start peeling little bits of clothing off as dinner cooks, or even as you are eating dinner!|`|MPYQ2Mfuaa	some guys are not romantic at all it depends on the guys personality .. why don't you do something romantic and get him in the mood|`|iPFUJXvpaa	WORK WITH HIM -- IS THEIR A REASON WHY HE SEEMS UNINTERESTED ,THEN HELP HIM TURN IT AROUND . SO IT GE T'S BETTER NOT WORSE...|`|CCXMW0HYaa	Leave him?! Marriage isn't a boyfriend/girlfriend thing. "For better or for worst, honey. For better or for worst."
SAgCy83Oaa	Actually, Government is the ONLY entity with a right to define / recognize marriage, as it is a situation most-pertinent to legal questions, requiring a clear, specific structure requiring parameters that all parties can recognize/acknowledge - i.e., government decree.  Government has no role in determining what constitutes LOVE and how beings should FEEL, but marriage is a legal relationship above all else.  You can call THOSE things anything you want, but society needs to have a "say" in what we call MARRIAGE.  You can form any bond YOU want, call it whatever you want to call it; just don't ask that it receive Government sanction if it doesn't meet the needs of Society, as expressed through laws.     Actually, life would be MUCH more complex, far from being easier, under your pattern.  Conflicting positions WILL develop and will need resolution.  Your recommendations give no way to handle those conflicts.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Because people freak out. I've never actually thought of that before. You have a valid point. Just because the government doesn't recognize you're marriage as valid doesn't mean that God ( or Allah, or who ever you worship) won't see it as a valid union.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	It is a case of trying to do the politically correct thing.   Make everyone happy, which is failing miserably.|`|s30Duwdraa	Because logic doesn't usually dictate when it comes to anything the government says or does.  It is a sad, sad world we're living in!|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	It looks like you have been drinking the tainted Kool-Aid.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Anymore, I am thinking that aside from the religious aspect of it (which I believe in), I think that it all too often benefits women and women alone.    Speaking from a male's perspective, I am not seeking child support from my wife, nor alimony and I have custody.    If we have a look at the reverse of that and the statistics that go along with it, we see all too well what the government is doing and what women are getting.    Just the facts.|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	my boyfriend and i have been together for 6 years, we live together, we have a child on the way (it was planned), and we will have another child in another year... and we are in no hurry to get married.... and people will look down on us. I say people and the gov't should mind their OWN business|`|OJcWrMADaa	i personally agree with u,i too want to know,marriage should be a private thing no matter which way u marry.|`|30a6856e0114dcf6cb5a1cd66f84151aaa	Religion and traditional expectation?  I am looking for the answer myself!   (Why get married? UK posted an hour ago!)|`|aSKsDtwLaa	But.....  It is a legal contract recognized for tax  and insurance reasons, among others.  I think two consenting adults are all that need be required.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Families are the builiding blocks of our society - they make and keep it stable.  Married couples are usually the foundation of a family.  Governments give them certain 'protections' in order to have the most stable society possible.  We all enjoy the benefits of a stable society.  Think what you want about the institute of marriage, but it is our foundation.    I have no idea where you get that life would be easier without marriage.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Actually, life would be much more difficult this way.  How would disputes be settled when these relationships ended?  Custody and property rights could be a nightmare.  Marriage, in the technical sense, is nothing more than a contract between two people.  There are specific laws in place to address the dissolution of such a contract.  Without the contract, things can become messy in a hurry and the legal resolution of conflicts would be outrageous in many cases.  Why do you think that gay couples are fighting for legalized marriage?  So they can have all the legal rights and protection that a marriage contract offers to heterosexual couples.  As for exploiting marriage as a means of attaining cheap government benefits, I think you've got it all wrong.  People who want to exploit government benefits DON'T get married.  Benefits very much favor unmarried people with children over married couples.  While there are tax benefits to marriage, the folks that would exploit government benefits are probably in an income bracket at which they aren't paying taxes anyway.|`|AA11956029	coz they want to have a civilized place to live....it is diffrent being a human and animal so thats y d rules otherwise it would b a jungle....|`|ojiO3svoaa	i totally agree with you. its not just government messing it up but religion as well.     but hey, who told you life was supposed to be easy? lol|`|VwgQYZHkaa	I agree with same and opposite sex but past that can spread new mutations and diseases.|`|L1TQJlrRaa	I think it has to do with the need for the government to try to add order and structure to all things of life. Just like race, income status, age group, and so on.  *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Because there are legal issues involved (taxes, insurances, medical decisions,etc.), therefore a contract (a legal marriage) has to be completed.    As far as marriage itself, I agree with you.  Marriage is a private and religous thing, it has nothing to do with the government and the government should keep their nose out of it except for validating the legal contracts between two consenting adults.
aDhZIhQcaa	Where do I start?  I am extremely blessed!  I am in love with my man, he knows how to please me, and WANTS to please me.  He says, "I want to spoil you" all the time.  I am 49 years old, and I finally have found the "one" God intended me to be with.  I have never been "in love" before, not ever, till now.  I love my life and have no regrets about anything in my life because any good or bad has taught valuable lessons and I have become the special person I am today because of those lessons.  And my man feels the same way about what he has been through and about who he is as a man.  I love that he commands respect just from being confident in himself.  He is a man's man (kind of like James Bond) ha ha, very masculine, a great lover!!, loves to do things for me, never complains, and he accepts me for who I am so that I do not have to change to accommodate him.  That in itself, is different for me.  He believes in me!  I thank God everyday that my honey came into my life.  I wish everyone could find and have what I have found.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Married for 26 years - still going great and full steam. She is every thing one can expect in a wife - I love her for all my life. We are not on the same intellectual plane still we relate in ways beyond explanation. Even without saying anything - we can understand each other - probably that's the language and power of love. It gets stronger by the minute. We do fight and differ - but a kiss/hug is all it takes to get back on track. She the most beautiful lady on the planet. Best of luck.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Something nice about my Husband....<br>  <br>  He is an outstanding Dad to not only his 2 Biological Kiddo's, but to my 2 Little Girls as well.<br>  <br>  He plays the Wii with the Family without shame...

So,,, he did FOUR loads of laundry, IN A ROW!  <br>  <br>  Although, that wasnt what I had in mind, lol. It made me laugh<br>  <br>  a good aspect of my husband.............. he doesnt raise is voice. but just between you and me and the rest of yahoo, I think the only reason why he doesnt, is so I seem even more crazy when I do.  :)|`|wia9SXCPaa	My children are the best part of my marriage!

Then, I had physical therapy Tuesday and boy did my back hurt... he grilled hot dogs, took care of the kids and "made" me go take a bath... LOL I say "made" because you can't really force me to go do something that makes my back feel ten times better by just sitting there in the tub. LOL<br>  <br>  He was at work this morning, and found out he has to work swings, starting this afternoon, which sucks... but he said he would be taking the trash out and cleaning up the kitchen - since I'll have enough to do after my PT today, and have the kids by myself. :-) <br>  <br>  That was some pretty happy news for me.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	She Likes To Clean ;)|`|H2bpuDsKaa	He's an excellent daddy..... :)|`|l1KlZrAOaa	He's good in bed!|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Yes, my partner is my dog...most loyal man I've ever met!

71yXXY3eaa	Yes you are overreacting.  If there is no clear indication to you that they are doing anything like that to you because of your weight, it is probably a conjured up belief in your head.  Do not let the thought bother and enjoy your life instead.|`|DiSOdCFXaa	being chubby has nothing to do with who you are. only the jerks care about appearances|`|KQjhOdsIaa	i don't know|`|PNwr3JgBaa	They are probably not strong enough, or don't want to be crushed.|`|ATb5iWoXaa	Ewww 5 ft and chubby yuK!|`|YN9nRZQvaa	nope. If I knew she was fat and only 5feet... I knew I was getting ready to kill myself!|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	no, he might really care about you.|`|MHcxmjP8aa	I think you're over reacting and you should just let it be. You sound like you've never had a problem before with guys, so lighten up and love it.|`|4459ubzsaa	just dont squish my weiner! =]|`|4Ob8z97Aaa	Giiirl, most men like women with some fluffyness to them.  I have realized that too, I weigh 152 but most chubby girls get the guys before I do..So love yourself, because i used to like skinny guys and now I like guys with a little meat, or at least a belly to lay on :) hehe|`|z3QsWmzpaa	it sounds like your bf really does care about you and you do pick up a few lads so you must be pretty just be confident in yourself =] x|`|ZuFVHsRpaa	Obviously they don't care about your weight so neither should you. They love your size and you should be happy about that! I understand where you're coming from.|`|Sru8JnBBaa	Okay, first of all, in your mind, I want you to replace the word "guy" with the phrase "that living entity that eats, sleeps, and breathes to do just one thing - get laid."    Now that we've clarified that, you ARE over-thinking this, rather than "overreacting," as that's not the word I would choose. It's all about confidence; if you have it, you will exude it, and such trivialities will cease to matter.    Don't go with what "that living entity that eats, sleeps, and breathes to do just one thing - get laid" tells you about your looks. Ask some girlfriends who you trust, or some women you don't know very well, for an honest assessment. You will far more likely get the truth doing this. Just be ready for what they might say, and place no expectations on the situation, or what they might say.    Some of the hottest women I've ever gotten close to were "thick" in the body department. Some weren't, but some were. The ones who were, though, definitely were demure, classy, and exuded confidence. Sexy. Oh yeah.|`|VcIYeMcyaa	i speak from personal experience.. and that is all..    first of all whoever wrote eeew is a loser..    i have dated girls slim short tall chubby or not.. it does not matter.. what matters here is finding the reason.. and that's what you are after..   yes a lot of guys would use your self doubts that you are displaying here to take advantage of you.. and if he cant pick you up that's his problem for being a weaksauce.. i weigh only 160Lbs and i can lift 200 no sweat.. and no i am not a gymfreak just work out here and there. guys telling you that you are one of the prettiest girls they have ever met are comparing you.. and that on its own is a mistake, you shouldn't be compared to lady X no matter what the reason. a lot of times people ask question to wich they already know the answers. i promise you that if you read what you wrote you will find the answer to your question. and one last thing. my current gf is about 110lbs or so i belive to me light as a feather but for her she is HUGE! yes those are her words.. so i wouldn't be surprised if you really are supercute and actually good looking girl who is overthinking this..|`|F6NQblvKaa	you have  sad life.
qKY3GZEJaa	im a gall and have loads of boybest mates when me and my bf first started goin out i realised he had a problem with it we talked about at and now hes not botherd , weve bin goin   dtrong ever since ,talk it through with him and ask him who they are hell probs think its sweet that ur protective of him ,  x<br>  <br>  hope it helps x|`|t0K6Haoyaa	well facebook is actually alot better than myspace in that if YOU would get one, you can go look on his page and see who is writing to him and who he's commenting to, UNLIKE myspace. If you do have a problem, your heart is usually right. Just confront him about it. Just ask, like "hey, boyfriend's name.... this girl named..... whatever.... asked to add me, and I knew you were friends with her" where do you know her from... if there's nothing going on, he'll tell you how he met or knows her. And that usually keeps an arguement from happening unless he get's defensive... he might be hiding something.|`|t8swfyD4aa	you got jealous for one of two reasons... either you don't trust him and your relationship or its just because you are a girl and this is what we do.  do you trust him? if you do then him having girls as Friends on a computer is no big deal. Do they live in the same town? is he putting his status as taken or single? if you remove him then you cant read comments and stuff like that. so think about what is worth it to you and how much do you really trust him.|`|aOx0U3wKaa	chances are they are just his friends, im sure you are friends with guys too. i know how you feel, my boyfriend's best friends are mostly all girls, and don't remove him as a friend, it would make you look crazy and jealous, just don;t let it get to you, or talk to him about it, cause they could even be relatives|`|fYDX6Ugiaa	On his profile, is he listed as "in a relationship" with you? For me, that would be the big issue. If he has female friends on Facebook, I think that's OK, as long as he didn't meet them online, which would raise some red flags.<br>  <br>  I think you might be overreacting a bit. You have male friends on Facebook, right? What would you think if he got mad and jealous over that?|`|UGHVDspjaa	Its natural to be slightly jealous I do get like that, its normal, don't delete him as thats petty, he will get friends with girls as it will be old school friends and thingd. Don't worry to much don't get obssessed and give him a hard time or he get annoyed with you|`|Jj0zcJLwaa	Some internet "friends" add you just to boost their own friend count, I have over a 1000 "friends" on my tagged account, I only added about 20 :S|`|CIcnppgkaa	No chicken chill....If it is really worring you confrout him and tell him that you dont really like it.|`|6szy4wngaa	You are being vey childish here a lot.<br>  A man has a right to have other females in his life as well.<br>  Its not like hes going out with them he loves you for you thats why hes going on with you.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Do you have male facebook friends? And does the "how they know eachother" answer say the went to church together?

You can't take it to seriously.  They're just girls that know who he is, they're not interested in your man.  If you ask him about this he's just going to call you nuts, which you would be.|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	I have friends on facebook that I dont talk to or even email, but I do know them.

hLWy1evQaa	Ok...calm down buddy. Take a deep breath.     It's okay to be shy. I used to have the same problem, but when I got to university, I made up my mind that I didn't want to be anymore. I had to force myself out of my comfort zone, and often went out of my way to speak to people I didn't know of both sexes. It takes practice and it's often uncomfortable. But you just have to learn to shake it off and try again. Just like your art, public speaking (both formal and informal) takes practice.     Talk to girls as if you would your guy friends. You'd be surprised to find out that many have the same interests and humor as you. There is nothing different about talking to girls and guys except the difference in chromosome.     As for the girl who's art you [failed] to critique, don't sweat it so much. There's absolutely no reason to feel guilty and I can assure you that after the initial awkwardness she probably hasn't given it another thought. And if she likes you, as you suspect, she probably even thought your fumbling around was adorable. Don't ask me why.     If ever you're in a situation like that again, and you can't seem to stop babbling pointlessly, stop, take a deep breath and try to rearrange your thoughts. If that doesn't work, crack a joke about having chronic verbal diarrhea, which will probably elicit laughter and ease the tension.     Don't be afraid to critique people tactfully if they're asking for it. If you're honest and genuine and there is no malicious intent, people will see that and appreciate it. f    As for being hurt in life, everybody has their issues and their past. It may or may not contribute to your current dilemma but the thing you have to realize, is you can't let your past rule your life. It will only make you unhappy. The best thing is to learn from it, and go from there.|`|sc6VBAmzaa	Aww you poor thing. You remind me of my current bf. He was so shy and never talked to too many people for like 17 years (he's 23 and I'm 19) Thank goodness his best friend helped him through those years. I know where your coming from because my bf and I are both shy, It was so hard for me to start talking to him and yes I started because he was way to shy. The thing for both of us is that we had a god awful past and it seems you did too, as you've stated. If I want something bad enough, then I go for it, even people. If I see someone that would make a good friend then I begin to talk to them no matter how stupid I may feel or sound. And yes I made a lot of stupid mistakes but joked about it to make them funny. It does sound like you have social problems which is what my bf and I suffer from too. I would suggest you find someone to talk too, like a counselor to get some of your social problems out and for that person to try and help you. I know it helped well for my bf and I. You will be taking a big step in talking to someone or even making some good friends with girls, but I know you will not regret having those great friends. Just take a deep breath and start talking, no matter what it is, conversation is appreciated. I know exactly where you are and how you feel for I was there and so was my bf. I would say more but it would be way too long. I wish you the best of luck!!!|`|ZuFVHsRpaa	I have that problem too. obviously not with females but I always say that I'm going o go talk to someone but I never do. Maybe you should take  it one day at a time. Take baby steps and eventually you'll be able to talk to almost any female. Good Luck!|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	bottom line grow some balls already,dude tighten up.|`|LIU1UROdaa	well, alot of girls hate when guys have low confidence about themselves. so you should loosen up and start getting confidence so you can have a girl that actually likes you for you and not for nobody else.. i've gone threw shyness and i'm pretty sure evrybody does but it's cute that your shy but not always especially if your this young, you should have some confidence about yourself and get your head in the game and take risks man...|`|Ivcldk9Oaa	Ok wow what a long paragraph. Well first of all being a shy is not always a bad thing....and just because your a guy doesn't make it bad either. Some girls love shy guys. I do believe that things from peoples past can have an affect on relationships or just being social in general. I know I do and I have only told one other person that I really can trust, and I think when you find that person or "girl" you'll feel better and relieved because you let it out.     I think you should practice talking to different girls. Maybe that one girl you met does like you and you should ask her out to do something fun or just to dinner. Not everyone is an expert at getting girls or guys.....it takes time and practice. I freeze up all the time and I do get mad at myself for it but at the same time I think it does help sometimes. I do think that is good you mentioned your not into swinging and nocking up random chicks......so you should have problems with the ladies.    Try not to be so hard on yourself. Girls can sense those kinds of things. Like I said being shy is not a bad thing.......you have to find a girl who will accept your flaws and will embrace them.|`|gFHzuIrUaa	Well first off not all of us like to be called chicks. If you thought she needed a little help with her art you should have said, "Oh this is good, but maybe you could try this next time" or something like that if you gave her constructive criticism in a nice way she might have appreciated it. And life shouldn't be all about work if she likes you and you think shes cute ask her out, and have a little fun for goodness sakes. Maybe you can tell her that your really shy, I think she'll understand and try to make it a little easier on you. Good Luck!|`|ks2oieV0aa	Be Yourself, whether someone likes you or not, let them base there opinion by who you are.  RELAX.....start out by talking, see if they want to study or get a burger or something.  xox|`|DUOoMBqoaa	First of all. We ALL have girl or guy problems! Second of all, you are not shy, you are too insecure to say what is on your mind. Stop being so hard on yourself and embrace who you are. Tell the chick, your sorry and you think she's awesome. Heck, tell girls that you are shy and say the wrong thing all the time. It might be funny and lighten the moment. Eventually, when you are not as stressed about what you say, it will be easier to think clearly. But it doesn't happen overnight, that the lame part about really starting to talk to people you are interested in for the first time. But it gets better, just keep at it, it will get easier... I was too shy talk talk to anyone when I was 19. Now it doesn't bother me at all. I still get nervous sometimes, but that's OK.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you might want to get that confidence.|`|4TdBKpobaa	I can be shy myself but I've learned just to go for it...

Now when i had my son almost 6 years later, i had to move back home, my mom loved it more then anything, she helped with my daughter and my son, so i got really depented on her, and for me that was a bad thing because when i moved out i was a little lost, or for a better word overwhelmed. Just remind here that you love her and will always be her daughter. But you have to have you own life as well as she needs to have hers. And i can say from personal experence my realitionship got 100 times better. She more liek a bestfriend, that i talk to everymorning at and in a way it's made us closer. : )

Confidence and arrogance are sometimes mixed up.    And, in my experience - the only people that matter in what they think about me, are close friends, loved ones and family.  Also my employer and my colleagues - as i have to work with them of course.  The rest? You guessed it, i do not care.|`|wTMMG0enaa	i think it's them...when going through a life changing experience (such as a bad relationship) of course your not going to be the same (wtf is wrong with your friend, and why didn't she try to help you get out of that relationship?) and also, "finding yourself" is something everyone goes through, you may stay the same,change,and accept things about yourself all at once, have you told your friend about what your going through? I think you need to get a new best friend. your are changing and you are doing all of this for you, who cares what your friend thinks and what all her friends i bet they are the ones who are really arrogant, you are trying to become a new better you, and that's all that matters.|`|D92vrOAlaa	if you take them on you would not reach anywhere be yourself.try to ignore|`|xxiX1qQgaa	Be yourself, always no matter what, you should listen to your best friend but tell her that when you got a bad relationship is normal to changed I mean you learned a lot about bad experiences and is totally normal to changed, but don't hurt her feelings just tell her that is time for you to changed, and tell her how appreciated are you for all the things she done for you. Good luck|`|zRnliMkkaa	You shouldn't give a hell what they think because they are not your friends. but on the other hand you should care what ur friend is telling you. ask her to explain and give examples of what it is u are doing that comes off as arrogant. sometimes confidence is mistaken with arrogance. just have a discussion with her and tell her how you feel about what she said and where ur coming from.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	i don't care what you're story says...you should listen to people, take the good and leave the bad.  thats it...it doesn't have to be complicated.|`|AB3D5gIJaa	no u shouldn't care about what others think just be who u r and not who other people want u to be|`|QCj4QA4yaa	Hi, do trust people. Make sure u respect everybody feelings. Second do what u feel is best.|`|f4zHMZ1iaa	It's hard to say - everyone perceives "arrogance" differently. What they see as arrogant, you see as confidence. Have you done or said anything that has made them feel bad about themselves? Do you put people down, or judge them? You should ask your friend who told you this to expand a little more on what she meant.
vHxauOyeaa	Just deal... remember the better times.   My grandmother has been bedridden and something is eating her brain stem... tehy don't know what it is but she lost that whole name thing years ago. It sucks, but just try and talk to her a bit... tell her you love her ... just appreciate that she is alive for the time being.|`|ujHkXVucaa	you just need to spend time with her. its hard, but tell her all the things you want her to hear. it will help you feel resolved.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	This is a lot to happen all at once and I'm sorry.  I hope that she is comfortable and not in pain.  Do what you can to be with her during this time even if she can't talk or is sleeping.  Her spirit knows you're there and is thankful.  Do what you can to say goodbye even thought that's going to be the hardest thing.  If you're a spiritual person, meditate or pray over her to remind you of all the good times you shared with her.  Take comfort that she will be free from pain soon.  You will always have your memories to hang on to.  Write her a letter to let her know how much you care about her or talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling.  This is not going to be easy but my guess is that she'd want you to be strong.  My thoughts are with your family.|`|IEVwBt24aa	look .. everybody will die someday like me and you too . deal with it and don't think too much on your grandma . look on the bright side of life ! you still have your family and friends that sopport you in any way . many people lose that too but life goes on no matter what . good luck |`|elSUVcaZaa	Sorry to hear of your sadness. The aging process is one of the most painful part of life that we have to come to terms with. In a sense it is a way of preparing us for the loss of a loved one. The only thing that I can suggest, is that you spend a little time alone and let your thoughts collect on the enevitable farewell that must come. try to also focus on a new family member, or the baby of a friend. The contrast will allow you to accept better the circle of life that you are a witness to. Good luck.|`|ejxpsVq5aa	OMG, I'm so sorry that's terrible. I feel for you, my mom past away almost 3 years ago, she was diagnosed with melanoma shin cancer and she had it in her vaginal area. Which is rare. And they gave her 1 year if they removed it and it possibly coming back. Which it did, then we had only a 6 months left to be with her. The hardest part was she didn't want to stay in the hospital, she wanted to be home with us. We saw her go through all the stages, and slowly slip away, very sad but she was happy to go this way, which made us happy because we did as she wished. It will be okay, this is painful to go through. All you can do is spend as much time with her and talk to her and ask questions and just tell them how much we love them, just try to be strong and patient. And god will do the rest to give us strength to get by. Keeping you in my prayers, sorry not sure if it goes by you, but i do. t/c

AA10065812	***  Rule  1  A home is not a democracy.  It is a dictatorship, and your parents are the dictators.    Rule  2  You need only obey those rules for 18 years, or however long thereafter until you move out on your own.  Thereafter, you will have over 60 years to do whatever you want.    Overall, it's a very short time that you will be under the control their control.  The whole world will be waiting for you, thereafter.  But, what you are learning now, whether you want to learn it or not, is what you will need to deal with the whole world.    Do you know how old Christ was before he was mature enough to make his own decisions?  He was 30 years old.  Are you more mature than him?    You did not even BEGIN developing the ability of conceptual thought process until you reach age 12.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_...    This stage of development will not be complete until age 24 in females and age 30 in males.    Slow down.  You are still a child.  Enjoy this time.  You will be missing far too soon.  Remember your parents are there to teach you, and worry about you.  This is a difficult time for all.  The other day, a 15 year old boy was assaulted and robbed in an upper-middle income area that is not known for crime.  He didn't tell his parents he was going over to school, after hours, to run on the track.  There was nothing wrong with what he wanted to do, but there was in not telling them.      Good luck and have a long, healthy life.|`|uAzBvk5gaa	umm.....thats the way parents are. LIve with it until your 18 then whatever. Maybe you did sometihng that made them not trust you?|`|HeAFlwFeaa	wow that sucks.. maybe you should talk to some one|`|tGlnumvKaa	How old are you?  Do you help with the house work? If you make a mess, do you clean it up? Do you do things around the house just because? Do you clean your own room and do your own laundry? Is there a reason they don't trust you?  Is their a cultural clash? (parent's growing up in one culture and you growing up in another)  Do you conplete your homework as soon as you get home? Are you at least trying to get good grades?     What do you mean by "out a bit in the afternoon?" Do you skip school or do you go somewhere else instead of going straight home from school? What do you mean by  "go to net at night?" In what ways have you changed?      You need to look at these things and see what you can do to regain their confidence in you. When that happens, you will be able to regain your own confidence.     In order to be treated like an adult, you have to act like one! Running away never solves anything. It just gives them a reason to treat you like a child. In order for anything to change, you will have to talk to them about it. Don't throw a fit, don't accuse them of trying to hold you prisoner, don't cry!  Ask them if you can talk to them, then let them know it bothers you and tell them why.     Ask them if there is something you can do to gain their trust. And if you can help around the house. If they tell you that you can't do something it's not because they are being mean, It's because they are your parents and they are responsible for your actions. You should be responsible for them too.|`|YI5QnbUjaa	Sorry, I have to agree with Papa Bear.  Until you are 18, you should try to at least get along with your parents.  They have to set rules for you, or they wouldn't be good parents.  I hated all the rules my parents had, and I fought with them a lot, but once I moved out, my mom and I got along better than ever!    Trust me, you aren't the only one that feels that way, we have all been there!  It really doesn't sound that bad!|`|7mLvb0rNaa	If you are old enough to get a job i would... that would show you are responsible and they can start to treat you more grown up... or play sports that will keep you out of house and give your parents some since of pleasure by watching you at an event....

Slow down! Just try and enjoy his company and his personality without thinking about his body. Relationships don't always have to be about sex. Even if you are nearly 17, it doesn't make you more or less 'ready' than anyone else, it's not a case of how ready you are. It's a case of not being an idiot and ruining your relationship by having sex too early.
FWo0oScMaa	I had  a problem a bit like this with my best friend we had been mates 14 years old and she started hanging out with someone else all the time and stopped inviting me out. I confronted her and ask what her problem was and told her she was pushing me out after a long chat she understood how bad she had made me feel and apoligised and at the same time i realised she had a few problems she hadnt told anyone about and helped her with them!     Your friend probably has some of her own issues and is trying to deal with them the best she can without getting the people she cares about involved. Try talking to her and be straight with her tell her how she is making you feel and that you would be there for hger no matter what but if she doesnt share her problems with you, you cant help!|`|rlQymP7waa	Well first of all, make sure you know that this most likely has nothing to do with you. When you are in high school and middle school, people (especially girls) change quickly, and not always for the better. At this time, the part of your brain that lets you see consequences is totally disfunctional...so she probably doesnt see the consequences of drifting away from you.    You can try to figure out why she's drifting, but I suggest that you give her space and let her come around. In time she will see what a great friend you are. For now, be friends with someone who really deserves your friendship.    best of luck.

AA12212310	Watch the movie "You've got mail" starring Tom Hanls and Meg Ryan. Very Relevant|`|AA12170560	Western civilizations have a communication issue...    90% of our communication is through NON-verbal cues - not what we write.    So when you read a persons words on line...you have to add 90% of whats being said using your own experience and ideas.    You're falling in love with the image you've created for yourself.    getting to hear a voice is really misleading because we are equipped to differentiate voices - you can hear your moms voice in a crowd...we also tend to be attracted by certain vocal tones...that makes us very descriminating...if you're attracted to the voice and the written word...you're hooked...and you've never seen the person or how they live.    Proceed with extreme caution and before you commit to anything...date face to face for awhile...|`|AA11151460	No, thats not love, its lust.|`|AA12315388	then you are in love with being in love...|`|AA11093708	no. u re just lonely and can not for some reason attract men around u. so u find escape on line.|`|5e500bbfdb42f41dad2078a0ea5fea56aa	I think it's true you can fall in love with some one you don't know.

But beware he may not be what he may present himself to be.|`|AA11792112	No and its not possible to "really" love someone you meet on-line. You only know what they want you to know. Its not the real person that you think you "love". Meet them, get to know them before you do anything stupid. And only meet them if you truly believe they are honest and not some molester or something.

If there is no reason it sounds like you have pretty much broke up already|`|AA11116059	Well it depends.  Do you know where your boyfriend is right now?  Is he in another city, state, country or what?  Or is he not talking to you because you two got into an argument?    If you two did get into an argument you should at least give him a call and see what is up with the relationship.  If he does not answer or call you back in a week or so then forget it.    But you should at least talk to him.  What if he is in trouble or something bad happen to him.  He might be in the hospital.      Call him and see what is up first.|`|AA11132313	yea, it is already over|`|AA12089968	I THINK IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND YOU CAN TALK TO AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE, BUT THEN I DONT KNOW THE REASON WHY YOU HAVENT TALKED TO HIM IN A MONTH.|`|AA11443620	Unless there is a real good reason for not talking together for a month   (distance if you live apart is an example),   then you dont have a boyfriend anymore.

AA11853609	Looks like the same one who signs yours and approved your user name..Oh no your better than that...............
AA10533955	Unfortunately, since you have a history together where she was a financial burden to you it may be difficult for you to act like it didnt happen and try to start over.  It's not like youd be dating someone new for the first time and willing to put up with a little more things to get to know someone.  You already know her and it sounds to me like you don't believe that the relationship will work, and if you start off thinking like that then it will not work.  I have a tendency to date guys that sound like the way your ex used to be.  And, because I am not able to say no to them or because i feel like they have changed and deserve a second chance or because i did really care about them and they still care about me too..........whatever the reason was, I ended up in a pretty bad financial situation myself.   In 2003, I bought myself a brand new BMW 330ci, which I traded in a 1998 BMW 318i for. I now drive a 1997 Nissan Altima.  I completely understand where you are coming from.      My Final Advice to you is: Just Don't Do It!  (Although, if you're anything like me you probably will anyways)|`|AA12095484	Find someone else.|`|AA10766815	I think you need to give her another chance, people can change in 5 years...Just go slow....|`|030dd82cb167c736f497afbef6fd62d2aa	you already know the answer to this one dearheart. please follow your better judgement. i don't think you're crazy, but getting back with your ex is a crazy thing to do. a $5000 cd isn't much to show...i wish you well.
AA11588361	if she is taking advantage of you, that's called DISRESPECT, and is not healthy for a relationship. you may have to re-evaluate your relationship with her.|`|AA12059542	its kindness on your part, to allow her to go somewhere?  your the one with the problem... she doent have to ask your permission to go ....hello! so she goes anyway right....i don't blame her! what is the real deal? your a control freak.... what woman would like to date a guy ,.who was trying to control her, and where and when she can go places?  the worst part is you call it " kindness " when  you allow her to do so....lol... she will get sick of you soon and you will be history....believe me... your her boyfriend not her dad... get over yourself !|`|AA11371978	teach her not to be this way...put you foot down.|`|AA11427901	It seems like she loves to control, I would get rid of her, she doesn't deserve you. Don't let anyone take over your kindness, step up a little, don't be afraid to say no to a girl. She'll respect you a little more. Good luck.|`|AA11816396	Dump her. It's a both sided commitment.|`|AA11125843	You should try talking to her about how these things effect you.  If she truly loves you and wants to be with you then she wont do the opposite of what you ask of her.  Could also be a good time to possibly start looking elsewhere if all fails.|`|56775eb359074eaf8934217199aabf50aa	If she's doing that, it's not worth sticking around. Leave her or talk to her about it. Or just stop being so nice and if you don't want her to go somehwere tell her seriously you don't want her to and if she does, leave.|`|AA10210526	dump her if she just likes your kindness then dump her because she only likes you for your personality not for who you are|`|AA12306645	Sounds like you like pain......No one can treat you like a door mat unless you lay there and take it.  You are too young for marriage, but use this experince when looking for wife material....|`|AA11201088	don't let her do that, it is enough now. You just think yourself and act accordingly.|`|14671d6c27693318910c515e22a803ddaa	Basically you've set it up for yourself.. Sometimes to get people to stop doing something you dont like.. is to walk away for awhile and mean it.. if your wishy washy about it  then people will walk all over you...Ask yourself how badly you want to keep her? is it really something you want to put up with?  Depending on your answer  IF yes you want to keep her no matter what than your accepting how she treats you.. You will run into trouble if you go about trying to change how people act. Doesnt sound like she wants to change how she acts to me.|`|66a8ca67f51c999a8596620416ccd30baa	your playing games and so is she if you do something that you know i don't like butyou know im going to get over it then im going to do it  so stop acting like it's okay and fuss later about it .you really like grape but say oh you can give me strawberry and then ***** about it hello.|`|6259d13f21d0a72626ab858e208f4912aa	if she's doing that dump her becuase that is disrespect and if there isnt respect in a relstionship it wont work|`|06124c7266d1d3a62034764b48a58a8aaa	You should start acting like you don't care about where she goes and she will start noticing that you don't care anymore. Also you should start going out places and that will start to bother her. Next she will start telling you how she don't want you going anywhere and then you can say well now you see how it feels.|`|AA12153999	She knows she has complete control over you and that she doesn't always have to listen to what you say because you'll always forgive her. You need to sort out some things with her. I mean what kind of girlfriend will just ignore your feelings like that and do what you said not to do anyway, knowing that she can get away with it because you're so nice to her? If you let her, she'll keep doing it and it'll get worse. Say you tell her it's important that she be exclusive, she knows even if she strays, you'll forgive her. That's completely not right. You need to sit her down and tell her how this is hurting you and being unfair. If she doesn't try to respect you more, you need to move on and find someone who will.|`|AA11468301	use her, use her for your own refreshment and fun. ask her for a little sex. take off her clothes kiss her **** and then put ur **** inside her ***** or what ever u want

Since you have come to the answer place I am going to assume that what your wife is doing is bothering you.  If you are asking "here" for advice on what to do...then I may again assume that you have made it clear to your wife that you do not like it?   You see your question is not clear.  You may as well have asked.   "What do you do when your wife insists on doing something you don't like....even though she knows very well it is upsetting to you?"    You question doesn't need to have lesbians in it.  The problem is with YOU.   Now you have 2 kids and a marriage that is not working the way you want.  Have you suggested counciling?   Women are usually surprised to hear the man suggest counciling.  Men naturally avoid counciling like they avoid asking for directions.       It's like this.   Either you are going to get over it and allow your wife to hang out with her former lover or you aren't.    Here is a speech for you.  Think about what you want in your marriage.  Talk to smart people.  Parents, friends parents, clergy,               *                 *                 *                     *                      *               *   Hey! Guess what?  I don't think that you hanging out with a former lover is a good and healthy way to keep this marriage strong.  I certainly don't thing that "I" should be hanging out with former lovers of mine.    I don't feel important to you when you do it.  I want to feel important.  I want to know that I matter and that what I want in this marriage is being taken seriously.  I'm afraid.  That is the bottom line here.  I'm scared.   Do you honestly think that hanging out with a former lover of yours is a good way to make the marriage strong?   Do you want to be married to me?    *                       *                    *                     *                         *    You may not like some of the answers you get.  Your wife may not find you "any fun" or "exciting" any more.  It may be that it is just convenient for you and her to stay married because of money and social pressure.    Marriage is a hard thing to take care of.  You have to really want to stay the course to make it work.  Evey time you turn around there is another good reason to get divorced.    Back in the Pioneer days a man and a woman worked so hard at survival they didn't have time to assess how much "fun" or "excitment" the other person was giving them.  Now we have romance novels and movies and the neighbors to compare our lives to .....So to answer your question the way it was asked:   I'd tell her I don't like it.  I'd ask question about what she wants and what she is willing to do to make it better...I'd ask what she wants me to do to help make it better.  These questions often lead to heartaches and smart *** remarks and can lead to arguments and fights....all of which can and will lead to the next right thing....be that , separation, divorce, counciling, or making love.   If nothing changes.......nothing changes.  stir it up...what have you  got to lose?

You have to go by what she tells you and decide how well you trust her word.    If a girl's hymen is broken, it could've happened from anything. Falling down the stairs, or a bumpy ride on a rollercoaster. Sorry, but it's not like a super-strength thing that will withstand anything except a penis pushing at it.    Doctors can't really tell. My gyn had no idea if I was a virgin because I was 18 and it was already broken. I didn't have sex to break it. It was from some other activity in life. Who knows what. But if a girl says she's never had sex, then you need to decide if you believe her.     Also, if you have sex with her and she doesn't bleed... that's no way to judge if she was a virgin or not. I didn't bleed when I did the first time. That's just a bunch of bull. Unless you're having sex with a teen, you're not going to cause extreme pain and cause her to bleed. The pain of a girl's first time is usually soreness the next day because of things being stretched in a way they've never been before. It's not excruciating! Sheesh, people.     Don't listen to anyone but her. If you have doubts, then that's for you and her to work out. But there is not a miracle way to tell. Just like there's no way for her to tell if you've never done it, either.|`|80c0299225422e7f58ba16b6000cb320aa	I think the most mature thing would be to ask her but if she feels uncomfortable change the subject or tell her you find it attractive that a girl is still a virgin. You can really tell by the way a girl acts though if she is uncomfortable with you making out with her or something she more than likely isn't experienced.|`|eb2ff5f5fb842abbdf9578102cec424eaa	she will bleed when you sleep with her pink small amount of blood and it is slightly painful|`|b4f2e4abd6848e12f06ad06cb8bd016faa	well, if she is a virgin she will most likely bleed if you have sex with her, that means that her hyman was not broke. otherwise ask her like the other two answers said.|`|a6178d88b1c4255041d4114ab8d66763aa	You cant base it off if they bleed that first time... it can get "broken" from a number of things other then sex.  Just ask.|`|c4c076d18c393c85ac4670f33ac25ad5aa	How you can know is.  First ask her if she is or not.  You could also talk about sex, sex positions and anything to do with sex.  Also bring up using protection.  Just talk about sex to get her reactions. If you bring up sex positions or oral sex and she doesn't know what your talking about or and doesn't know how to do these positions.  Maybe she's a virgin or just doesn't know how to do them.  There's plenty of ways to figure it out besides just asking her if she is or not.|`|AA12195080	there is a thin piece of skin deep inside of her,if she is still a virgin you would feel it when you make love.if she is no long a virgin it would not be bronken thur and would stop any thing from going to deep inside of her.

That is how people feel around ex convicts.|`|AA11638305	It is simple really - people are afraid.  One hears of women hooking up with an ex con - and some of those women are hurt, maimed, or killed.  It is because of those few ex cons who cause problems which hurt those other ex cons who have learned a lesson and are on the straight and narrow.    The best thing to do is to let the woman have as much time as possible to get to know you.  Take things very very slowly.  Do make certain that you are established with a job and a place to live - and show her that you are indeed back in society.    The more time you give her and the more patience you have with her should only help to get her on your side.

Besides it's the imperfections that make us different and unique. Those are the qualities that we choose in a partner. There are of-course some undesirable qualities like a liar or cheat, a thief or hooligan. Look for someone with compassion (if they are kind to animals that is a good sign). Generosity and good nature are also good qualities...    Decide what imperfections you can live with and then choose partners from that criteria.    as for tuning him in to you why don't you step up and ask them out?|`|23a0334585f0d1e3612851903be02a59aa	hey look no further im right here

AA10664023	First you must decide if you really want to leave him. If you do fill your day with activities and hobbies; try seeing friends you haven't seen in a long time and try maybe some exercise (I recommend swimming but anything will do). Whenever you start thinking about him do something like reading a book or whatever you need to keep yourself concentrate in other things. Of course you want to stop thinking completely in someone then you may want to fall in love with someone else. that is the best way to forget; but the new guy has to be better for you than the last one. So after saying all this I might say... this is not the easiest thing to do ;) so try to go back with him if you think he might be the one.  Good luck :)|`|AA11573606	why would you want to do that?|`|AA11952785	I wouldn't bother trying it won't work|`|eb2a37fa84b847583b625da6dc350561aa	Hey i guesse u cant stop thinkn' about someone that might be the 1!!!!!

To be honest you'll never know until after you get to know them and let them get to know who you really are not just surface impressions, as friends despite either of your shortcomings.  When you both have a good concept of who you are.  Ask her or him (I don't know which you are.)     People get crushes all the time, and sometimes when they see you for who you are it's not what they were interested in.  That's why it's important to build a working friendship before starting a solid relationship. It's not a 100 percent full proof method but it's most likely the best.    Besides you don't want to have someone who likes you for what they think you are, or something you did, but for who you are and what is in your heart. A real, lasting relationship.

I hope he isnt that way.

10b31d7109a360752e8863b0bf89ca6faa	Definitely the apartment. Moving to someplace you can rent will give you time to learn how ot live on your own. There is alot of new responsibilities that come with the added freedom....by all means well worth it. It'll give you time to learn how to pay all the bills, manage your money and take care of your own place without having to worry about repairs and mowing the lawn and all that.    There are alot of hidden costs in buying a house, especially a starter home. Repairs, lawn care equipment, furniture, etc can add up fast.     When looking for a rental, look for something within your means. Your total living costs should not exceed 50-60% of your total income.

dbfd176f4be00bc205f755421d116366aa	Better see an attorney. In some states, a spouse's debt is not owed by the other spouse, unless it is for a necessity whatever that means. Some years ago, a man was forced to pay for a very expensive luxury piano, the stupid judge decided that was a necessity. (Where do they get these guys?)    On the other hand, there are some legal issues which can make you liable.  For example, if she used a jointly used credit card, you might get stuck for the most outrageous luxury since that joint card means you accept her charges.    Also, if she divorces you, that same stupid judge (there are so many of them) might make paying that debt part of your property settlement ruling. It is real easy to be generous with other people's money and lives.  Women should really rebel when judges treat men this way, since such disgusting things make it hard to get men to marry.  They don't say a word, they just whine when they can't find a husband.    NO, it is not a good idea to mortgage a house to pay her stupid debt.  If there was a guarantee her misuse of money would completely stop, it might work. But, there is no reason to think she is going to change, and if you do anything very aggressive to control her stupid money practices, she will be here next year whining her husband is a control freak, and our little kiddies here will be telling her to divorce you, though they don't really know what is happening.      If she hadn't died several years ago of pancreatic cancer, I'd say you were married to my ex-wife. Her constant cry when she was flirting with financial ruin was, "I might die tomorrow."  So, she suffered constant financial problems and misery for, um, over 35 years, just in case she might die "tomorrow."    She also battered my daughter so badly for over ten years, the girl needed therapy for years in the military.  Proving once again that only Mommies can really take care of children.|`|AA11110297	Yes, sorry but that's how it was for me too|`|7ce59dae3479c97950626dbebdc3f7b1aa	if my husband did this i would say no first but then id eventually feel sorry for him being a dumb a*ss and id start helping. good luck|`|f26b6a9190616880b68898cb4a22b632aa	Dint Mortgage the House, you will only put yourself in more financial Difficulties.

You have a responsibility to yourself to determine whether a person is financially responsible before getting married.     When you marry, you agree to share joint financial responsibility.    I'm not sure how you didn't notice the things that she purchased, but at any rate, I'd make her pay and I'd cut up the credit cards.

That hurts more that he was just there a few days ago telling you that he loves you so much.  You need to find out the reason..not that you will feel much better, but not knowing will bother you alot more.  Talk to him and tell him how you feel about him and what he did.  Do you think there is another girl?  You gotta keep busy, be around friends and do stuff so you aren't sitting at home thinking about him all the time.  It's really hard, but eventually you will get over him if after you talk to him, you know it is REALLY over.  Good luck!

Also if your on meds for the blood pressure this also could cause limpness|`|AA11110297	See a doctor for a complete physical and follow his instructions.   Better health can be achieved over time - as you exercise and make healthier food choices --- having  a loving and supportive spouses also helps---- tell the wife to check her attitude because if you said that (i don't care what you look like) she'd be VERY OFFENDED !  Maybe some marriage counseling could be of some help ----|`|1dead629b5c6b5052ec7d46b74da9569aa	Ok, first, you have to get her to stop obsessing.  Ask her who is she going to show off to?  And tell her that while you are glad that she is beautiful, that you will be with her for the long haul no matter what.    As to losing weight and sexual performance...how old are you?  Make sure she knows that guys cool down with age, and that frequent urination could certainly cool down an erection.  I think losing weight would help your health definitely.  But, if you are urinating frequently, it could also be diabetes, and you should consult a physician.  I would suggest losing weight for health, but not for appearance--and I think you will find that appearance will come along with health.  But before you start cutting calories, check with your doctor.|`|8c8696d67b4124887af2e240763d468daa	Absolutely,erection has a lot to do with blood circulation in your body,when you're fit its much more easier than overweight also try to cut down a little alcohols and smoking if you do also effect it greatly.your wife will be impressed to see how hard you are doing your best to please her,look good for her.|`|0af27319af7a74c577bb1a7f8cf24ea1aa	sexual erections or more mental than physical....maybe its because you find yourself unattracted is what is causing this dysfunction because you know how much ur wife is into maintaining her healt.  so maybe if she joined you in some form of fitness routine daily it will add some spice to your sex life....imagine after a nice workout both of you really hot and sweaty try jumping into the shower or even maybe on one of the workout machines...|`|AA11325963	OK, Scott.  Not to worry about the loss of erection.  That will happen from time to time--don't panic.    As to the health concerns, it sounds as though your extra weight is causing some issue(s)--high blood pressure for one.  Frequent night urination may or may not be directly related--chances are this condition is entirely treatable--often with lifestyle changes.  See your Dr. and follow his instructions.  Do lose weight, however, no crash diets or radical measures.  For most of us--more and regular exercise and cutting back calorie intake will do the trick.  May need to cut back on fluid intake 3 hours before bedtime.|`|749477e82568907830b5df540219a7a2aa	Losing weight helps sex. As you get older and also as you have sex with the same person over and over I don't think it's unlikely to lose an erection while going down on them. I had a break up and I came a lot harder when I was on the market with new hook ups. But then again maybe try role play where you pretend to be other people. In terms of orgasm and exercise I would recommend yoga and core exercises as well. They helped me strengthen my "core" a lot and as you know the abs, butt, and piss muscles are the ones that shoot your wad. Your wife just sounds insecure. If you tell her that you want to be perfect for her and that you hate the way you look because "baby you are perfect and I don't feel like I'm man enough for you" and think about your dog dying and start to cry she'll totally be into it...unless she is a woman who hates vulnerable men which means you will lose regardless of what you do. Good luck.|`|2b635a7afebc767a8d758a1fd0d69411aa	Frequent bathroom trips in the middle of the night, along with your weight sound like you may be diabetic. I'd get in to your doctor and work on getting back into shape. Everything else will fall into place.

If you strike out on the 1st try just remember, we you finally do get it and it's good just think how happy you will be|`|cf1cd7afaec0ef72c9fdec0c84d7f639aa	You never know until you try, but yes asking someone out is very difficult, Go for it, he may be thinking the same thing.|`|9d5b6c222a665efc482678ab770ed8a8aa	Do not think of it as rejection Think of it as God keeping you from making a misake|`|5a63c02694335c37637e9998a3e01cc8aa	u dont, never ask a guy out. if he doesnt ahve the balls to ask YOU out he aint worth it|`|fd9c164b22bef51fc866bfd6ba674d53aa	make a friend ask him for you|`|c4c076d18c393c85ac4670f33ac25ad5aa	Don't get embarrassed because if he turns you down that's just his lost and you shouldn't feel bad about it. Because there's always someone for all of us. Ask him out and if he says no and does embarrasses you just smile about it and forget about it. It's not worth getting embarrassed about.|`|4664bdfa1cda0ef29f8cf8b3a202e423aa	What makes you think he's going to reject you?    Can't you angle things so that HE'LL ask YOU out?|`|AA11266370	dont be embarresed...and rejection is just part of it...takes sa while to realize that not everyone has the same taste in everyone else..girls i like dont like me  and girls that like me i dont like kinda thing..just ask..if he says no..no big deal his loss move on to the right guy casue he obviously want the right guy for you ..and the more you ask the easeier it gets...good luck|`|b0eea14c29a8b8adcb74866aef7b2152aa	Same way guys do when they ask girls out.  Keep your fingers crossed and pray.    Just ask him out for coffee or for a drink.  Something low key and casual that will give you a chance to know him.    If you ask him out for say, coffee at 5, if you like him you can say Hey, lets go to dinner, then drinks . . . then . . . well, you get the picture.    Guys are ALWAYS nervous when they ask a woman out, likely the guy will just be happy that you asked him.  And you don't have to worry bout a guy giving you a fake phone number, or otherwise blowing smoke.  If he's not interested, he'll say so politely.|`|0cb83ba0441b8e626922a7c215683d64aa	Just think of it this way.. when the guy says no after you just asked him out-- just be happy that he was being honest -- I think you would rather him be honest than him playin you.|`|9ef11fd7477f42fc35ce844d35d90adbaa	to avoid embarassment when u ask a guy out, dont get your hopes up before u ask them.  just be calm, collective, and dont worry if he says no. theres other fish in the sea! and have fun, dont worry so much about havin a bf, being single is fun 2!

33a48752e5ffedd8b17fbaed11b0f83caa	I am wondering how long you two were together. Iam assuming a while. When two people are together for a while they become comfertable with each other. They become so comfertable that they feel as though its normal to be together. Now that you two broke up you probably feel like things are not normal. Just know one thing. That does NOT mean you two belong together. Your ex-girlfriend is probably feeling the same way and jumped into another relationship to try and fight those feelings off. You cant do that and its okay everybody copes differently.

You can just enjoy it, or you could tell him it bugs you a little bit. Or you might turn the table on him and tell him "That's Misses ***** to you, studmuffin!"

He probably learned it from someone that liked it and thinks it's true for every woman, or he just learned it from watching porn.  Either way he didn't learn it from you and if he wants to please you he will change it.     Or like the above have said, it's some sort of fantasy.  But still it doesn't have to be every time.  Geez!  haha|`|8e0e58819824e14376b24031d09b8284aa	if my boyfriend called me those names...it would ruin the mood for me and make me feel dirty and nasty...he should make you feel beautiful...and hes not going to do it by calling you those names.. sounds like you dont like it ...so you need to tell him you dont...if you dont it may hurt your relationship

A suit and tie can mean that you are professional and possibly wealthy. Women defintely like a man in a suit.    But remember its not the clothes that make a man... but a man that makes the clothes. You can dress as nice as you'd like, but keep talking like "cuz" instead of because" or phrases like "all that stuff" and a woman will quickly know you're not classy.|`|4686195ee2e42daaed30e4443f200bbdaa	Yes|`|AA11840865	Only a tie|`|a5182e3f5f16262d217663039407a740aa	Two words..

643ee1269def6ad84a2ad8450e860581aa	It's hard to tell what the problem is with you and your husband.  I would guess stress from the family situation.    Somehow you have grown apart - maybe due to your responsibilities as parents, maybe due to job, maybe due to money, who knows?    No one should have to live in those conditions.  Fighting is not a good way to communicate.  Somehow you and your husband need to start actually talking to each other.  You may find common ground and work to get the marriage fixed.  You may find you don't like each other and separate.  Either way, you need to move from the stalemate you are now in.    Is he cheating?  He could be.  Men who are not happy in their marriage often cheat.  Women also cheat when they are unhappy in their marriage.  It isn't right to cheat, but some do anyway.  Find some way to get communication going.  You can ask him what he wants to do about the situation (and if he is cheating) then.  Don't be surprised if he wants out.|`|3b91972650738e2180cc43345f44e573aa	Before you do anything you might regret FIND out what the problem is from his point of view then go from there with your decision.Make sure he knows  what you want/need and make the time right!|`|AA11354052	he maybe cheatting,ask-spy,if he is leave.|`|AA11404078	Sorry to hear your relationship is so distant with your spouse.

If he doesn't come around by then......then simply tell him that you need some space and time, and move out to your mothers' or a friends place.  Maybe he is just taking you for granted. A little time apart may be good for the both of you.  He may not know what he is loosing until it's gone.........If after all that, he still doesn't come around.......then start talking to a divorce lawyer.

37f54a350e8577a779d6fd7fa5fe9406aa	Hey Girl,  Well since no men have answered your question, (at least up to the point that I am) here goes.  If he is young he will constantly try to make eye contact with you. He is naturally afraid of rejection and wants to be sure you feel something for him. Plus he needs to verify that another man is not in the picture. Plus he needs to get that damn zit off his nose that appeared a the exact time he decided to approach you. Don't know why but no matter how old a man is, just when he is ready to make his move, the facial zit appears. Basically a curse on men put on them by their mothers when they were young and naughty. Just a guess.  So anyway before I write a book here. Just trust your gut and let him know that it is okay to approach you,  hopefully you like him too. Remember men are fragile at this stuff so be easy on him and patient too.  hugs to you,  jeffrey|`|AA12068358	stares at you, goes out of his way to see you. is always willing to help you. will do anything just to spend time wiht you. compliments you. always tries to be perfect around you. trries to make you laugh. ... hope this helps|`|f01d9024fab4a11a8aba4cce18dd2078aa	Ask him.|`|df230326666fefa301470868758745f6aa	at first be sure that u like him.

Saying yes is sooooo much easier, and then the girl can let the guy know if she does or doesn't want to go with him, in less direct terms.|`|2bab7047ef7c34f7d4027e5d8a7eff79aa	he will try to impress you constantly. read tips on dating and flirting to help you more on this site|`|AA11106670	he picks on u.|`|2381139948ae0b9abf2516e029043130aa	isnt that lifes question?|`|10a1db757cf566ecab93a260c5eb7748aa	Ask him.

All this stuff is just a trap and your going to get yourself stuck and when you do he sure will not be around. Keep it real let this man know you aint no fool and you aint no clown that is going fall for his tricks. Whatever he plans to do your best bet is to say "NO" you ain't doing anything. Don't get pregnant by this man, how you know he will be there to take care of this child with you. Mens tell you anything you want to hear. They have roles they try to play but let this man know you aint up for no games and you got better things to do in life right now then trying to conceive and have childrens. I would hold off on marriage to. You got to think is this a guy I want to spend the rest of my life with. My advice to you is don't do it this seems like something you will regret in the long run.|`|c45a450311f2d77f4bcc402546cebce8aa	I would not take him seriously.  There is no good reason to have a child, before you are financially able to do so, and have a stable family environment to raise it properly.      If your parents do not approve of him, then there is probably a good reason, since it's unlikely they would do so just to hurt you.  He sounds like he's a manipulator, and a user of women.  And those type of guys make for very unhappy marriages.    If I were you, I wouldn't allow him to have sex with me without a condom [given the choice of either do or no sex; men will usually choose to wear one, to get some, rather than go without].  If he is not willing to wait for marriage to have a child, then I doubt he's someone you should believe will marry you, even if you do have one.      Do what you think is right.  If he truly loves you, he'll accept you for who you are.  And if he doesn't accept you, he wasn't for you anyway.  In that case, it may hurt to lose him, but in the long run you will be glad you did.|`|d2e87c60d802eb3070a5f9bdbc567eb5aa	That guy is crazy.  If guys want to get into your pants they will say anything to do it.  They do not care about babies or what they could catch or give out.
c92b34b57afe08ccef2923c11171750caa	Okay... First of all you need to get face to face with this guy and try saying something like this.....  " I know that I messed up... and it hurt me just as much as it hurt you. I cant stand being without you... I will never cheat on you again and you just have to trust me. I wish you could trust me again. It was the biggest mistake of my life losing you. I want you to give me another chance... Maybe you could go with me to homecomin.. and we can take it slow. "   Or leave him a little note on his car asking him to go with you or something.     Hope I could be some help. & good luck|`|AA11307280	have a friend tell him that u want to go to homecoming with him. thats what i did, and the guy asked me. congrants on being queen!|`|AA11828811	Ask someone else to write it down in a letter for you.

I hope he says no, but you never know he might be stupid enough for you to get lucky (again).    I hope he realizes how much you miss him and are so desperate for him to be your arm candy at the dance (got your dress to match his eyes yet?)  and can show your "friend" (that's a laugh) you just have to click your fingers to get him back again and prevent her from getting him.

Tell him that if you want. Cheating is when there is something like marriage and other girls/guys are lusted after besides the two in the couple. Don't worry if he doesn't trust you. Find yourself someone who you know you can trust. That is the point. Make sure that they understand that dating isn't a real relationship, it's something like a test for a game. You test to see if a relationship could work. get it? hope you do. And I hope you find someone to take you to the homecoming, good luck!|`|AA12089968	JUST COME RIGHT OUT AND TELL HIM.

He probably will not find it flattering and he may show it to all of his friends, and your feelings will be hurt, that he shared the note with others.      When you see him, smile and say hi.  Don't say anything else.  You can flirt by smiling.|`|AA12089968	IM GOING TO GET A COKE AFTER SCHOOL, MAYBE ILL SEE YOU THERE AT ________!|`|AA11977614	Tell him that you want him and that you need him.

I guess that's the best I can give you.
8e1f140936dd7a827f6f2be48b9a9545aa	To change the dynamics of this long established relationship then the friend likely has to see you in a new light - meaning that you may have to change your behavior.

Begging and pleading will not work to keep her.

AA11760715	I think she was saying that he was ugly because maybe she was interested in him. either she did it out of jealousy or she was just trying not to hurt ur friendship with her because deep down she liked him, if yall are friends yall should be able to talk to each other and be honest. dont waste too much time because the more time you waste the more opportunities you will miss.|`|AA12089968	SOMETIMES YOUNG PEOPLE DONT GET INTERESTED IN SOMEONE UNTIL ONE OF THEIR FRIENDS DOES, AND THEN THAT MAKES THE SOMEONE WORTH DATING.|`|8b87e4e5789fb6f0e20a8b0d3d8af24baa	She didn't want you to have him!|`|0998c58a42e00823b42399decc8fdc93aa	well yea u should tell her Like i like him and u knew it why are missing with him?i think the girl is a bad friend and u should tell the boy u like him!
fc41be3bf3379e36905b64068a78c8d0aa	Yes, it's better to have a lawyer, but if you can't afford one you can go to the library, and find the papers you need to fill out start the process.  When you file the papers you will still have a filing fee, but not nearly as expensive.  Good Luck|`|6a6086b2996985e57de03e16c5597258aa	You can but it is a reall pain in the as5, and judges HATE people who represent themselves in court.  Whether you have the money you cannot afford NOT to get a lawyer.  2 years separated?!  Your hubby could be running up debts etc. that will make you poor for 50 years paying off.|`|AA11327878	just like the last answer you have got to find a lawyer.  they will let you make payments.  if you guys have been seperated for 2 years then it should be a simple process.  you can be divorced in 3months.  i know!!  done this before!!    thank God for divorces!!

Just because you have a crush does not mean that you are in love. He probably got a girl. It might just be about what he see not you personaly. If you want to know if he likes you or not speak to him ask him do you like what you see?If you never see him again don't sweat it there are more fish in the sea, and if you like someone and don't know if he likes you communication is the key.|`|c1ca6e88a04a2e6dc0d0616abb43ade1aa	you love him cause he looked at you? wow doesn't take much huh? you must be a very young girl. I think you just like what you are seeing of this guy from the sounds of it thats all you have done is see him...you probaly never even spoke to him or even know his name.  Love is a very stong word.

AA11946848	As long as there are people brain washing her and telling her bad things about you she probably wont come around. You know your a good mother it sounds like your ex needs to find a hobby and quit trying to ruin the relationship between you and your daughter. I havent ever been through this but if my husband were to ever turn our daughter against me it would just break in two. My daughter is my every dream come true and I cant even imagine how things are for you right now. I hope that she doesnt listen to all this garbage thats been said about you and hopefully she will start contacting you again good luck.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she will find u when she is ready, she is mostlikely getting problems with her father over her contact with you. sometimes we get lied on, seems we can lock our doors against a theif but not a liar. one day she will find you and want to know the truth, right now she is listening to your ex's lies.|`|AA11780989	I don't know how old she is but I bet he still has an influence on her.  Give her time and she will come around.  I'm sorry - such a shame.|`|804b08035213bc9da8c84ed4835f2deaaa	It is really sad that a lot of parents who separate or get divorced use the children to hurt each other. Often the child is hurt most of all because they will usually blame themselves.  What I have to say may not be of much comfort to you, but children do not forget their parents whether it is a mother or father.  They can only keep your child away from you for so long, in the majority of cases when the child is able she will seek out the truth and you as well .   Yes I have seen this occur too many times, just pray on it and try to be patient.|`|AA11110297	When she's being monitored like that she has little freedom to chat with you - no doubt they could of deleted you from her contacts.    Your situation isn't very clear because - there's no mention of what was decided in court by the judge(and you don't admit to any wrong doing, so one can only wonder)... it seems you have a second chance with another husband and young son, so make the most of it and do what's right by them.|`|9792216a2cc25dd4a287bf44f01ec326aa	Be patient. There is an old saying " The Chickens Always Come Home To Roost". She will come around.
4a43fed1c99f6d646774e5e9a5d3a305aa	yeah i think the guy knew she liked you so that is why he kept whispering your name...next time you see her talk to her about him..she might be willing to express her feelings to you and then that could be a start of a great relationship!|`|AA10920682	NOT REALLY SHE WAS JUST TELL HIM TO STOP BECAUSE HE WAS EMBARRASSING HER, I MEAN YOU CAN TRY IT BUT IT MAY HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU .I THNK YOUR READING TOO MUCH INTO IT.|`|d21b8a886cea9e7687d2a1f509f75f80aa	that is her way of tellin u "come an approach me, i want 2 b wit u"|`|45659c8103455a36e943847a1d4a1d47aa	nope|`|AA11679109	no dont aproach, she is just being nice. but u cud saythanks for the other day. and c if u cud be friends.... baby steps baby...|`|5988d411f1d29f0695bbb2bdb6ccef33aa	Why was the dude whispering your name? Why did you not respond if you heard him? Whether he or she are loonies, I would not go out with the chick if she is hitting on you when she is with another dude, or was it the guy? There are plenty of other girls out there that don't have that type of baggage.|`|f568c23507eeeb3fa994a4489e6e7e8faa	no- she sounds like she's beeing an a s s to you!|`|a5556f79c55584d9a027f6244cb828d2aa	I actually think that it is! hse might just be trying to be nice to you or she could like you... you will never know untill you try! do ya feel me?!|`|be327de9a5afd39052afb77d3fa848d4aa	yep, I think she likes you dude ...... !    good luck !!|`|3a0b0d29b52e8eb861d3aee5e432f177aa	That is a tough one.  She may have let it slip that you were nice, or asked who you were.  If her ex is a chronic joker etc, he would definately be honor bound to tease her about it, in this case whispering your name over and over.  As for approaching her, don't do it while he is around or she will be flustered and embarrassed.  We females hate that combination of feelings and often duck out of situations as fast as possible when they happen.  I think it depends on your ages as well.  I don't know about if the comment she made makes her friendly, but if it seemed like it to you, then go for it.    Please do not make the mistake many males do...Do not bring up her ex in any conversation.  We like the attention from you guys, and most of the time enjoy your company, but there is nothing worse than meeting a guy and only talking about the ex.  yours or hers.  Instead, work towards finding out if you have anything in common and latch onto it.  Hope This Helped.  Good Luck!

"WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WOULD IF HE GAVE YOU THE TIME OF DAY" BUT AFTER THAT HE'LL PROBABLY GO BACKTO HER. IF HE REALLY WANTED TO BE WITH YOU HE'D LEAVE HER THEN ASK YOU OUT.

How do you think it reflects on you that you are trying to get with a guy that is taken? Not so good. You both need to grow up and act like adults. Let him finish out his relationship honestly and then it will be your turn if he wants you. Be respectful.|`|84c69d42e8a208487de0226372362eb5aa	well you might try to secertly meet him.oh and how do you know you love him if youve only held his hand???|`|220be1c5cb9b783ce71e70234dfc2e81aa	Easy gal.

The more you ignore your subconcious, it will quit talking to you.  |`|AA11110297	This is how a controller acts - take heed and leave this one alone!    Some things to look for in a compatible mate:  1)His or her goals and aspirations align with your goals for the future?  2) You feel comfort in the presence of the individual rather than negative anxiety.  3) The majority of your time together is not spent in conflict.  4) He or she does not pressure you to do things that go against your moral judgement.  5) Youre able to resolve conflicts in a healthy manner without the other mate shutting down.  6) He or she doesn't embaress you in public or make unkind remarks about you in front of friends/family.|`|41e7246fa6e2edbd9613b2d1d36e676faa	ma drop the guy aight look, obviously hes not on your maturity level. in fact hes not even good enough for you...look if a man is mad enough to embarass you at a party, over something like that, hes obviously not ready for the mature realtionship. because you being able to associate with anyone you choose comes with that. either he deals with that, or deals with being alone. you shouldnt have to associate with only ppl he ants you too, cause sooner or later he's going to say he not comfortable with you talking to girls period. im know cause i used to be the same way, but thats life u know deal wit it.|`|1039f6a9f766198d5b6bbba02752a421aa	no offense but he doesnt sound that great. maybe you should tell him that you do not appriciate the way he treats you and if he doesnt try and change that you will leave him, if a guy did that to me i would totaly flip out. to me that is completely unaceptible and should just not be left forgotten.|`|2ef48329209c8a1a8faa76ed30e1e8aeaa	he doesn't sound too nice or he has some Issues...|`|AA12161870	DUmp him.

Your friends if they are true friends will be there for you regardless if they like this girl or not if they are true friends. What is wrong with her for them not to like her? Well, it doesn't really matter because you are the one who wants to date her and not your friends. Don't throw away a good thing just because your friends aren't happy about who you date. Yeah you feelin this girl and your boyz ar trippin. Maybe they are jealous of what you got and they don't have it. Who knows but in the end you have to be  happy and if this girl makes you happy then go for it.

Bless her- if she likes you, then she likes you for you and not your friends. They don't have to spend time with her if they don't want to, but perhaps you could organise a group outing with both her and your friends so they get to know eachother and you can spend time with both :)    If they give you a hard time about it, you may need to put your foot down... if they still moan- they don't sound like very good friends...    Try your best, and do what you want to do with your life!|`|AA11344883	Listen to what your friends have to say.    You're under no obligation to follow it or take their advice however, you'd be foolish to not listen to them.    When you are with your girl common sense often leaves, this is why people date jerks, creeps and other assorted awful types.    If your friends are true and honest, have your best intentions are heart, ask them to be as blunt as possible about their objections and listen, really really really listen to everything they have to say.  Don't object, don't protest, don't justify anything, when they have spoken all they need to say you are then free to make a decision.
AA10804895	i would jus go see her, talk about old times, get 2 know eachother.  and u never know, u might like this jen girl|`|AA10655344	Freinds who have studied together all their life, and then move away when they get to college/universities, and with the distance, the regular phone calls, chatting, all that gets lesser due to the new place, new people....Its absolutely natural. I am sure you have met some new people too yourself. Yes, you should certainly keep in touch with her, while also listen to her when she talks about her new freinds. You should be happy for her, and probably show that you are still her best freind. Likewise, you will meet other people too, which is a normal change in life. Freindship would not usually ''die'' with distance, yea, it would need a bit of polishing now and then....probably you could catch up with her during weekends, and anything that you both would want to do together, like some other classes (dance, music)...She's not moving away, and even if you felt there was a little distance coming in between, you could always take the effort to pick up the phone first, and let her know you are around. She has not told you anything rude, or tell you that she doesnt want to talk to you, right ?? In fact, I feel she must be so excited about her new place, new freinds, and that is why she felt good telling you about her freind Jen...and thats okay, you are still her freind, arent u ?    So go on, and pick the phone, keep your friendship, dont let it go. But if it is really negative, to a point where she does not want to talk to you, then you know what to do. Just move on.

90b02d13d0e2cca02532b5742f02085aaa	Girl! It aint right and he isn't right! Just cause he's notgetting physical doesn't mean he's not cheating! Personally, I'd let him go, then go out and find someone who actually needs you, instead of just keeps you. Girl, that sounds so mean, but if the steaks cook up white, you can't serve it to the rabbi, you know what I mean. I just think that unless he cuts out that sort of thing, then you can do better. So know it's not right. Not for you! Go out and buy some new lip gloss, and some new clothes, and get out there, and let your real prince charming make you happy ever after.          Or make him say he's sorry, and promise not to do it again. But I wouldn't, cause I think I could do better.|`|AA11234615	You are reading his messages?

If you think you might be over reacting, try using some 'I' sentences like - I feel hurt when you...or I feel anxious when you..... and really listen to his response. Then reevaluate your commitment to your relationship.|`|cd1a810788f68a9dedf97e107dd8708caa	Its a forum of cheating, next will be lets get together you now the rest. The trust you have for him is going ,Sorry   You have caught him ,He wouldn't cheat [DAH] if there is a new meaning let us all know also read the hundreds of sites of people with your situation. Face it your being  had .     See if you can work it out but you won't trust him again.        Good luck|`|tA2zIDI9aa	1. u know him.....i think if he is your fiance and you think he would cheat you? think very good not just from the appearance   2. it isn't right that he talk to his ex like this.....just talk to him really good|`|99db02121ce94de6661edc600e6de577aa	he probably got used to calling her babe, i mean that maybe his endearment to her when they were still together.     but tell him to stop coz you mind. i mean maybe he didnt think it will offend you, but well, you dont like it so you have the right to demand him to stop calling her that. he'll probably be mad if you still refer to your ex as babe or whatever too.     just talk to him about it, and hopefully, dont fight about it. =)
fFHgdHXeaa	no|`|AA10940353	maybe|`|vMKEg29kaa	Give details about how you think and then we'll decide!|`|ZodYp7sraa	idk....i don't judge by looks
ySYcQhcjaa	He may be giving signs like you.|`|fhGhZ7cIaa	It sounds like he's comfortable with you as a close friend or maybe more. hard to tell. I've had guy friends who were that close to me but no romantic feelings were between us.    If he doesn't call or text you or so for a week, he's just busy getting his own space. You can't smother a guy to death.    You didn't mention. How does he treat you when you're sick? Does he ask you how your school is? I hate to imagine he's a guy who only cares about himself and talks about himself. I've dated those kind before!|`|AA11618519	Oucherz. Tahts a toughie. I would say you are givin too many signs, but I think he just may like you. just turn it down a notch and good luck! ??|`|9e78f1f00e7159039ef7cb3dab8445b9aa	i kinda have the same thing going on, at leasst the second part of physical apperences... i would say you were doing everything right and if he doesnt get the hints and signs you give him then its his loss, not urs    i would say, to be on the safe side, be his friend and then when u think the time is right, tell him ur feelings and walk away... if he feels the same he'll make sure you know, if he doesnt then move on....(breathe in, breathe out, move on)...    hope this helps, believe me, i really hope it does
AA11137435	Well many familys like yours (no offense) act mostly like you. Once again no offense, but when a child feels insincure boys usually confide in their mothers and girls confide in their fathers. So sice you confided in you mother that probably means you did not like any of you male family members. So when you start getting more time with your mother and many other females your brother will get jealous. So since your sick and tired of your family members bullshit you should go out there and start your own relationship have your own childrens and make sure they have a better life. Then you'll fell  like you accoplished more then you parents did.
AA10817556	He ended up pawing at me half the night and I had to call a cab to take me home because he expected me to sleep with him...NO WAY!

He'll eventually ask you out. The same thing happened to my b/f and I. Go for it!|`|rcBb1vHSaa	You'll never know until you find out. Maybe he just wants to hook up but not be bf and gf. I think he'll try to make out with you..of course
AA10845765	if you love her let her go and if she trys to come back don't let her. she shouldn't have left u in the first place, sounds to me like she likes to play the field, and she'll just leave u again.|`|a8QLIy8Gaa	The only way you can show her anything is through your own actions. show her how much you care for and respect her. but you must also attract her and being clingy and jealous is the last way to do that. Show her you respect yourself also by being there for her but not hanging on her every word. Let her know you love her and want to be with her and then let her make her choices by herself and be happy with whatever she chooses. If she wants to be with him and he's as bad as you say then she has issues that will only get in the way of you being happy with her.   all you can do is make your offer and if she takes it, cool, if not don't wallow in self pity, it disrespects both of you.|`|2wzxyQq7aa	dude let it go she never wanted you she only wanted to make her current b/f jealous.  DUH!!!  come on wake up and smell the coffee dude.  stop being so girlie and move on take it from a girl WE HATE GUYS WHO DWELL OVER US....she will never take you back unless she sees that you are over her and have moved on and she cant have you.|`|eceae77e93654ca780658aabb5d9ec22aa	you don't win her back. if it is true love she be willing to come back to and accept your mistake and be willing to work with you no matter the situation|`|OBJXqfdlaa	BE TOTALLY FAKE|`|AA10804895	Well, this is quite a fix youve got here.  First off, give her sometime and use that time to become good friends with her.  Call her up every now and then, ask her to chill or sumthin, then slowly let her decide which way she wants to go.  The hardest part is letting her go if she goes the other way [which is prolly the wrong one].  Tell her just how ya feel, sounds easy but it hard 2 do.    Much love Colie

AA11012938	you're 13 for chirstsakes... go out and have fun!    plenty of time for relationships later. and if he's pressuring you at 13 he should be hung drawn and quartered|`|d4d2280b501076605afd722cb2e0c536aa	ur so 13... i miss being a teen...lol|`|OxoVYVi4aa	...what?|`|X4ffO5Aqaa	2 points!!     sorry i needed the points, anywas its your right to have sex when you think your ready, just remember birth control and condoms!!!|`|geAWAsqnaa	Apparently you really dont know anything about relationships. If he is cheating, then he will always be a cheater. If you are cheating just to get even with him, then you have some problems to work out in your head or you will never be a happy person in life. And if you are cheating and not telling him about it, then that makes you not only a cheater, but a liar, which is even worse.|`|V5nOvTLKaa	1. that was not a question  2. you are in a dishonest relationship and you cant even spell yet??? (virgin, not vergin...)  3. if your only on here to waste our time, get off.. and go on your brats website that you clearly would have saved as a favorite..    and lastly, posting questions titled 'sex' and 'gay pplll!!!' does make you a little immature kid..|`|jl65QNtjaa	WHAT THA FAACK?|`|3LxBN1t4aa	im 14 wooooooo|`|PPP1ZCQwaa	you lost me|`|FYQg9coqaa	lmao. omg that was the funniest thing to read EVER. you lost ur virginity and you cant even spell virgin?  lol.  thats f*cked up.|`|yEv1bPdNaa	.. okay? lol
DotZU7o3aa	i think your sister might just be stirring it up a bit. perhaps she is trying to get back at you for what happened in the past. be upfront with your family, tell them it is not happening. have a chat to your sister too, tell her what she is doing is not nice.  good on you for being honest.|`|AA11327878	that is a tough question to answer.  you need to sit down and talk to your sister and ask why she is saying all of this.  if she is telling the truth about you going off on her then you may need to seek counseling to get this corrected.  you surely don't want anything to happen to your sister or your self.  rage can be controlled by different means.  you say that you are working on yourself.  that is great.  the biggest step is 1. admitting and 2. knowing that you want to change for the better.
bzfXbM4raa	Yeah, too early.      DON'T let anyone pressure you into anything!  Now are you saying no sex before marriage, or no baby?  Don't listen to that boy...if he's serious, he can wait.|`|AA11327878	DON'T GET MARRIED!!!!!!!!! you are way to young.  i got married at 19 and was divorced 5 years later.  the divorce rate at that age is so high.  you need to make sure that this is the right guy.  you need to date more people.  you have the rest of your life to get married.  as i tell my girls (13 and 14) don't get married before the age of 25.  by then you should have finished college and gotten your career started AND you have experienced a little more of what we call life!|`|nFVYFWwRaa	  Unless one of you is planning to go into the service then a firm job and housing becomes a major concern. Money issues break up most young marrigaes more than any other issue. in the millitary at least they give you the resorses to eat keep a roof over you head. good medical care for all of you kids too. And two pay checks every month. and by the time boot and basic military training is over so will the war as both sides are being forced to promise to bring the froops home early 2009. If you are in Love 18 is fine, just see about a pre-marrige course at a local church. most will cover money, housing, and the like. issues you have not had to think about living under anothers roof. Like why does the bank take money from your account for an atm after teh atm took money for the withdraw? They do and if your not ready your overdrawn and there is a fight. So preperation is important before you get amrried if 18 or 58. Bad Idea no not if you have plans. if you take your diploma and get amrried and live in your parents home yes it's a bad idea. If you want a baby, plan ahead, They last longger than 18 years they are forever, your parenets will tell you they still love you forever, or they should. Good Luck in Life Dear. |`|8e0HG8ILaa	Uhhhhh... YEP!  Why do you need to have a kid now?  GO TO COLLEGE, make something out of yourself FIRST, then think about SERIOUS things like KIDS AND MARRIAGE!!!  GOOD LUCK GIRL!!!|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	You should know someone for at least 4 years before getting married.|`|AA11627844	it depends on how mature you guys are. I suggest you attend some pre marriage counseling to work out all the problems and find out if your really ready for marriage. wait to have kids until you've been married for awhile and you both have good jobs and enough money.  if your not ready to marry then tell him so because you don't wanna rush into things. if your man loves you as much as he says he does then he will be willing to wait for you.  oh and moving in together can sometimes be the demise of some relationships especially if you don't work out the details before you move in together.|`|AA12275607	In this day and age absolutely. The issues surrounding divorce today and 18 is unable to handle and having a baby while you are engaged tells me you are soooooo not ready. |`|RgbARcJTaa	um speak to him say that maybe were moving too fast    take it easy say to him you get married when u graduate and u kno and get ur thingy and u can get a gd job for u babyyyy|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	First of all i just want to tell you that my boyfriend and I love one another very much and we have been dating for quiet awhile now and we both care so much about one another. And we want to get married but i'm only 17 years old right now i will be 18 in another 5 months. But i mean he is willing to wait as long as it takes until we are both ready for marriage. I mean 18 i think is way to young to get married. I think that the both of you need to slow down. I mean getting married to young usually ends up in divorce young. I mean you should not rush things reguardless if he wants to get married as soon as possible. Just let him know that you think that you guys need to slow down and take things one day at a time. Let your man know that your not ready for marriage yet because your still young. If he loves you, and cares about you he will respect your decision and wait. Well whatever happens i do wish you the best of luck! :) |`|JmbjZvdbaa	Are you pregnant? You guys can live together without having a child. And if you guys plan to get married, it's totally up to you two. No one can say No and Yes because you two are adults. Just make sure you're mentally, physically, spiritually and financially stable. And you're ready. Good luck!|`|vdcJBx6Daa	I don't think anyone should get married before the age of 24.  Here is why.    Your high school and college years (14-22) are a time for change.  Scientific studies show significant physical brain development during that time.  Those years also contribute to the development of personality, likes and dislikes, personal beliefs, and other pieces that make up YOU.  At 18, you still haven't developed yourself fully, never mind understanding what you really want/need/like in life.    After college/trade school, or after high school if you don't continue your education, getting a real world job (not just waiting tables on weekends) teaches you even more about yourself, responsibility, and real life.  Have you lived on your own without mom and dad yet?  Have you paid your own taxes?  Have you already climbed onto a carrier ladder?    And I haven't even gone into the fact that you are not financially stable.  Marriage and kids requires a financial stability you probably have not yet achieved if you are to succeed without undo stress.  Without established carries, you guys can almost be guaranteed plenty of arguments rooted in money issues.    Did I mention that the highest rate of divorce is among people married before the age of 24?      In summation, there is so much more for you to learn and much further for you to grow in the next 4-6 years.  You and your BF could be different people by the age of 24.  What happens when you get married now and, in 4-6 years, you realize that neither of you are the same people you married?|`|kZptrGQ6aa	I suppose so...|`|01d5aa28e8119b28808a80780cc05d5eaa	Slowwwwwwwwwwww down girl!  Date for longer than a couple of months before you think of marriage, absolutely NO babies until you are mature enough to make it on your own, and what is the frickin rush?  If you rush, it will be a mistake FOR SURE!|`|Tsjj4kDfaa	I think you should wait. Most of the couples I know who got married right after high school are now divorced. You should move in with each other first and see how that goes after a while. |`|HWU9tb0gaa	You wait. You need to experience life on your own first, maybe get a steady job or a college education. Don't be in such a rush. People change as they get older and what seems good now is a mistake in 10 years. If he loves you, he will wait. |`|WxdtbO9yaa	well it depends if you feel like your mature enough. don't plan to get married and have a kid if you plan on going out and partying all the time. your going to recognize all the maturities that a mother would hold for her newborn. if you're ready, and IN REAL LOVE.... then why not. but if your gonna break up/ divorce in a year, maybe month then no. also, if he's planning to go to the army then no. my friend got engaged to a guy during high school and they had to split up b/c he was goign to the army and she was traumatized thinking about it every night. but if you feel it in your heart then go for it girl. good luck!|`|ffWprHaYaa	Marriage at 18 is pretty young you have still got your life ahead of you. And picture this your going in for a interview,and you find out its the perfect job. But you can't take it because you come of work at 4 and you need to pick your kid up from at 3. Get the picture. Just tell him your not ready,and if hes the one he'll understand.|`|x1pIk9ptaa	Well first off..   answer  this question  "WHAT DO I WANT"  second, I got married  at 18 right out of high school   then i got divorced a few years and two kids later. i look back now and realize i was too young to  know what i wanted  out of life at 18 .i married a man who had  not grown up yet  himself.   consider living together  for a while first.  |`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	What do you really feel? and what do you really want?  Marriage is done thing, finished. You'll become institutionalized.  At your age, you're still very young and it will be better if you don't get tied down too early.  He seems to be very attached to you that he already wants to possess you. Give it some time.  Before you say yes, make sure that you really feel that he's the guy for you.  He has to touch you deeply that would guarantee he will be there for you.  Marriage is just like a contract. You will have to do all the duties of a wife which is what marriage is all about.  |`|tCiVuFK9aa	18 is awful young to be taking on such responsibilities.  I wish you had stated why it was necessary to move in together after you graduate.  That is also a big step.  Why would you want to be a live in girlfriend when you are not sure you are ready for marriage?  Isn't is almost the same thing? You stated yourself that you haven't been dating all that long so whats the rush.  I think everyone should live by themselves after leaving their parents house or with aa roommate before involving themselves in a relationship.  You need time to grow on your own and find out about yourself.  Why not try that first.|`|AA11328507	You guys are too young to be talking bout babies or even moving in together in my opinion.  you just said you guys haven't been dating long so STOP talking as if your guys have been.  Enjoy and get to know each other and see if you feel the same way in a year.

Walk in your neighborhood and find a rose bush and pick 3-4, go to the 99 cents store and get some candles, a bag of salad and a bottle of wine (don't know how it will taste, but it's the thought that counts. Go to the grocery store and pick up a stofers Lasanga and some garlic bread.  Then you go back home stick the lasanga and garlic bread in the over.  Prepare the salad, put on some soft music, run him a nice bath, take the roses and take the pedels off and lay some out on the bed put a few in the water.  Put on some nice and sexy, and make him feel like the king he his in ALL ways.  Do things that you normally wouldn't do to him.  Be nasty....They like that.  Good luck
SaGlPoeIaa	Sex is something that is intended for a husband and his wife.   It is a beautiful interaction that forms a bond like no other.  There isn't quite another feeling in the world.

Every time you share an experience it will also remind you of the hurt he inflicted that you do not deserve.  Get rid of this guy and move on and make yourself happy without him.|`|L9iZUjDIaa	I am so so so sorry!!  You need to get some conseling for yourself.  He is out of the house already right?

And he didn't just make "a mistake".  He made many of them.  He's not worth it sweetie.  This is killing you inside.  You need to rid yourself of him and move on.  He's just going to keep hurting you and you can't live your life like that.  You need to be strong and healthy for your kids.|`|9gxzPlZZaa	This is something that could have been prevented, you see you wouldn't feel like this if your husband wasn't thinking with his other head. I could see one time but so many times, I can't imagine how he can say he cares for you if he has been with other women. You need to stop and think forgiving is easy forgetting is hard, and the trust is gone. If you ever gain that trust back you are one in a million. I think what you need to do is get away from him for a while and see what is best for you really think about how much you can handle, if this happens again will you be able to handle it. If I were you I would Thank him for the good times and let him know you love him but you will never get over this and that you are ending it because you have a little more respect for yourself. Please know that we always go with our heart but can your heart truly forgive and forget if it can't you will be unhappy for the rest of your life.|`|BLGUGzipaa	You both need counseling in order for you to heal. However, you know your husband is a cheater and most likely won't stop cheating. So, you have decided to stay and forgive him, than stop thinking about it. When he cheats you can only blame yourself for staying. Because, you have accepted who he is, a cheater. Either, live with it or get out and gecounselingin and know that you deserve better.|`|CxUH0fJ2aa	that was too long to read entirely but 6 women doesn't seem like a big deal.  i've had a lot more than that since i've been married|`|ZhP30sXEaa	Stop having sex with him, unless you want to die.  Do you know how many things you can catch from him since he sleeps around ?  Geez girl,  you must be crazy.  I stopped sleeping with my ex because I was afraid of what she would bring home and spread to me.  Luckily I didn't get anything from her, but if I were you, go get yourself checked out.  AIDS, isn't that scary enough, what about all the other stuff that is out there... Think about it.... Wow....Terrible.....     Tell him he needs to get into counseling and get him checked out for Compulsive Obsessive Disorder.  My ex and I were together for 15+ years and most of it she cheated on me and I couldn't put up with it,  I divorced the *itch over 2 years ago.  I finally got my freedom from all the hurt and pain she put me through.  I still communicate with her once in a while and I found out she is in counseling and has been diagnosed with COD and that is what made her cheat and lie and run around.  I won't take her back, ever.      What you need to do is follow your heart and pray for help and understanding.  It is too late for me, but you can still work on your  marriage, if you both are willing to.  If you think he will cheat on you, he may.  It sounds as if you both need counseling to get through this, but if he isn't willing to then I would say he probably won't change.  Follow your heart girl, praise the lord with all your might, and look to him forgiveness and help.  There are tons of people out there willing to help if you all just reach out and ask for it.  But most of all,  Praise the LORD......God Bless and think Green and Gold.....|`|D0wFwBu5aa	Hey Jen, you have many dilemmas and your pain cuts right through your life.  The issue at hand is how youre treating the situation, youve been dwelling in the past for far too long, how can you have a future when you keep living in the past? Youre past is your future at the moment and every second you keep thinking about the situations of the past the more it will cause you agony.   Now that you know this you can take action and figure out the necessary measures to take, the communication between you and your husband is flawed because youre still extremely hurt by what he did which means you still have some issues you both need to fix together.   I dont appreciate the fact that he did what he did and that he hid it, imagine if you hadnt gotten the information out of him? I dont think its fair the way he treats you.    If you live near a park or somewhere thats covered my natural nature (none of that manmade stuff) take a walk by yourself and think about things but think towards progress not towards misery. What youre looking for is emotional closure concerning this matter and you wont be able to get it until you deal with every little derivative of this problem.   There are a lot of trust issues here and I dont blame you for it and I think youre a very strong person for what youre going through and when you move past this experience you will be even stronger and very liberated.  Concerning your love for him, dont use love to make decisions, love doesnt work very well when it comes to decision making. A great number of people stay in abusive or bad relationships because of this thing called love. He keeps constantly hurting you and I dont think thats love. You really need to be logical here, do you want to continue being hurt or do you want to fix things, you have big decisions to make.  Love can make people very passive to very bad situations.  Concerning your heart, I think its been shattered so bad my your husbands actions that when your around his its like hes stepping on it over and over trying to turn your heart into powder. You do deserve better and when I say better I mean his actions and how he behaves needs to change 360 degrees or else you need to provide him with the ultimatum.   My last words, happiness is derived from within you, no external thing can make you truly happy, those are fleeting ideas, you can only have true happiness from within yourself, that is true happiness and nothing can take that away.    I hope this helps    Send me an email if you need more advice or help ?    Tony Cupcakes    PS: One lie ruins a thousand truths. Ghanaian proverb  |`|Zh6Vhck7aa	sitting here reading your question it's obvious that you lve him and your family very much and would do almost anything to keep you all 2gether.it sounds to me that your very independant and way too good to him.My childhood sweetheart of 7 years cheated with my best friend and a few others.Although i loved him i couldn't get past the fact like you that he was in bed with other women.I too imagined the two of them talking about me in nagative ways{which they did}   If he doesn't treat you the way you feel you deserve ,by staying with him in a dormant relationship,you may miss out on that guy that may be around your very next corner.the guy that would love you for the good and the bad,through all your darkest hours.{you never know}.  For me i was also scared to leave my ex cause i was not used to being on my own and i thought someone was better than no one.But i was lucky enough to fall in love with a caring and honest guy,but i almost missed being with him as i was with my ex.think long and hard to yourself,if he doesn't change{people i know that have cheated,have continued it on}then maybe your kids too think its ok in time-when their older...tell him you are the bread winner the kids mother  the cook the cleaner and to give you some love and respect or you will move on without him,.when you think about it breaking up with him would have to hurt less in the long run rather than the daily thought of his betrayals to you.Since i have moved on...i couln't care less about my ex now....I hope i helped a little.you sound way too good for him.|`|eFhDtbSWaa	I had afriend like him and i heard a jeaouse bf or husban shot his gender off at clost range|`|Lmk8X8ECaa	leave him and get yourself checked end of question.

Good luck|`|wMbPyzxdaa	I had 18 years of the same thing you're going through.  All the women and 2 extra kids later I finally kicked my ex out of the house about 3 weeks ago.  I did it after talking with my Aunt and she asked me if I wanted to die?  I didn't get it right away but she was referring to the fact that he doesn't use protection when he sleeps with women.  So he's putting us both at risk for catching something life threatening.  Heck yeah it hurts.  I hurt - I can't sleep at night but one thing I can say is that I have peace of mind.  I don't sit and wonder if he's been cheating, I don't sit and worry about what he does for the other women and most importantly I don't blame myself anymore for him cheating.  Don't remarry him, it's the worse thing you could do.  I hope that you are not considering this because of your child - that's the worst thing you could do because you are hurting your child if you keep him around for the child's sake.  I suggest you do what I am doing and that is get a life - My world revolved around that man.  Now today I go to happy hour, hang out with my girlfriends, participate in play dates.  I'm having fun.  I do still have moments when he crosses my mind but as time passes those are become less and less. |`|3VExc2Q9aa	hun you really need to leave him. He is not going to change  you have been 10 years with him and he is still not changing, all you are doing is putting yourself through this hurting that you have and i understand how you feel. it is best if you just let go. He is going to keep on and keep on and keep on especially if he knows you will forgive him anyways if he does it. You are a faithful woman there is a guy out there that is willing to have such a wonderful person with a heart like yours that WONT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU. I understand you have been with him for so long. 10 years is ALOT !!  but those were 10 years of pain and im sure you do not want to go through that again. He's done it so many times he is not going to stop.  He's told u he's sorry plenty of times but he kept doing it. What makes you think he is going to stop now?.. He is only going back to you because he knows that you are going to put up with it.   He doesnt deserve you and you deserve alot more.  You have a daughter to raise, you do not want her to grow up and see you hurt all the time because of her daddy.  Just let go and be happy. i know it will be hard for you but like i said you do not derserve that. Let him play another woman like she's stupid not you.  You are going to go through alot of pain when you leave him and you see he is not in your life anymore, but it will be worth it.  Remember  things are going to get WORSE before it gets BETTER  GOOD LUCK =(|`|9K3kCCnaaa	Aw... Sweetie. I am so sorry. =[ That touches my heart. I can only imagine what pain you are going through...

xxDjV6Axaa	Wait, are you saying you supported the family and now don't have money to pay for college?  Or you helped her emotionally?  Bit of a difference.  Anytime you are asking for money or any help at all, it's best to be polite and don't cuss.  Even if she laughs or is rude to you.  Because you only hurt yourself by not getting what you wanted.  Can she afford to help?  Was she laughing because it was absurd when she can't pay for groceries?  We don't know the whole story here.  How did she abandon you?  She's still there?    Have you asked the school for all the financial aid they have available?  Have you checked Sallie Mae for loans you can pay back after you graduate?  Did you check Fastweb and apply for all the scholarships you could?  Did you apply for Pell and other grants?  Can you get a Stafford Loan?  Those are pretty fast but you have to go through your school.  If the aid isn't coming fast enough, go to the school's financial aid dept and ask for a deferment.  They can postpone the due date for you.  Ask the school about jobs on campus as well as look for some around your classes too.  If they have a co-op, that might be your answer.  Work a semester, go to school a semester.|`|AA11327878	i can understand the frustration that you have w/ your mother.  my mother and i have not spoken in some time now.  i finally sat down today and wrote her a letter explaining everything.    here is what i think u should do.  you need to find a job, keep going to school and move out and start taking care of yourself.  your mother has issues of her own that she needs to learn to deal w/.  you need to be out on your own making things better for you so that you don't end up like your mother.    good luck!!!!  and yes i have insulted my mom many of times so you are not alone.|`|vcwk9HhPaa	I understand talking in anger, but you should never say that to your mom.

xxDjV6Axaa	Oh, this is going to be sad.  That girl doesn't even know her but the courts will do anything in their power to put her back with her mother.  It could be the new bf is really trying to get her on the right track and straighten her life up.  He may want her to try to get all the kids, one at a time.  It would look much better if she did it that way so he might know what he's doing.      If you can't prove that she has a reason to be called unfit, other than the fact that she hasn't been around for 3 years, then I'm sorry to say that your chances are slim.  You have to have a compelling reason that she should not have her child.  So start gathering whatever documentation you can.  Take it to a lawyer.  They will tell you your chances.  If they are a good one, they won't take your money and give you false hopes.  I'm not saying this is fair.  It happens all the time.  That's why you should push for custody when the mother has left the child.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	sometimes we have to cry when others cry.(and laugh when others laugh)|`|VQCKjEacaa	do you have custody?? if not your probably screwed.. moms always have the rights unless you have custody.. idk i would still try to prove her unfit.. how old is this child?? just think whats best.. probably being with you  GOOD LUCK|`|AA11327878	find you a good lawyer and talk to him about everything.|`|cg0JjKygaa	No judge would let her take her daughter if she has not been in the picture, let her take you to court at best she will get supervised visitation, and if that goes well and she is really interested in being a mum she may after a wile be able to have her, back but only if its in the little girls best interest good luck x|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	You need to have custody of her, if not her mother can take her back.... or you can prove that her mother is unfit and that she'd be better off with you.

She gained so much weight it was repulsive to see her naked.  Sickening.  The women can say what they want, but it was.  Today, we are going through a divorce and I am so much happier.  You do what you feel is right but I want to be happy and the women can say what they want, but you only get 1 chance.  How do you wish to live it?  And what is their main response?

Your husband probably finishes too early for you to get to orgasm, so you should ask him to slow down a bit and take his time. I'd even mention to him that you haven't experienced an orgasm. Maybe he'll try harder for you.|`|NXA4fJbTaa	you are married but you dont know what an orgasm is?!  a bit weird to explain but read some erotic stories online. they are quite detailed.|`|CrA1gaPtaa	An orgasm is the ejaculation of sexual fluids after sexual stimulation. This may refer to the ejaculation of liquid by a female during or after sex or the ejaculation of pre-ejaculate liquid ejaculated by male before sperm ejaculation.
8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	You are not accountable to your mother in law.  Really it is NONE of her business.  What her son chooses to discuss with her is up to him but you dont have to speak to her about it.    If you have children then explain that you do not have a problem with her keeping in contact with the grandchildren and seeing them etc but make it clear that you dont want to discuss anything with her about the marriage break up.    What you have been through is personal and no doubt upsetting for you and she is being very intrusive and you should politely tell her so. Remember, sometimes people want someone to 'blame' or information that they can then go and gossip about, so be very careful who you share the intimate details of the marriage break up with.    Hopefully this will help.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	Tell her to mind her own G*d D*mn business!  Then quit answering her calls!|`|xI4L9byOaa	next time she calls just say look i wasnt married to you there fore i dont have to explan myself to you and that if she wasnt like this then maybe her son would still be married so back off and but out x good luck hunny x|`|504bb36f74e6a1d516b625e01829deb3aa	Tell her that you are a grown women and you don't have to explain anything to her.If she wants to know so badly why don't she call her son up and ask him for explanations.I just wouldn't answer her calls anymore.|`|XAfzIBjdaa	get caller id and don't answer her calls. write her a letter with your reasons  *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|RjpPzbBJaa	She is harassing you and she should be informed of this. If she wants answers she needs to contact her son, not you. Its both disrespectful and inappropriate.  I don't suggest you get into an argument either because it will only give her what she wants. If she calls, inform her she is harassing you, she needs to contact her son and she should not call back again. If she does call again you may seriously consider filing harassment charges. Otherwise she'll continue to do this until she gets all her anger/issues out on you.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You don't owe her any explanations. And even if you told her, she wouldn't believe you.  It's her job to support her son.      If she calls you and isn't civil, hang up the phone.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Dont answer her. Screen your calls, even call your phone company and ask for her number to be banned. she'll soon realise she isnt going to get through to you and give up.   What a crazy old mother in law. Thank goodness you're out of that relationship!!!|`|1bb0f7ae2b31d51224421eb6bee127fbaa	Tell her it's none of her business and hang up.  Make a written document of every time she calls, and call the police.  This way you have a paper trail, and if need be you can get a no contact order.  If you get one and she continues to violate it she could be looking at jail time.  If you have caller ID do not erase it when she calls, it will add to your documentation.  You deserve your freedom and owe your MIL nothing.|`|1kfeghDDaa	It is sooooo not her business. You could tell her that she can have her son back too.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	You don't HAVE to explain ANYTHING to her??????? This was YOUR marriage. NOT HERS!!! It's none of her business why your marriage didn't make it. You need to learn how to speak up for yourself. Stop allowing people to shove you around emotionally!!!!!  Just because she comes off as a control freak, doesn't mean you have to go along with her behavior. Tell her nicely that the reasons why this marriage didn't work out is between you and your husband. And NO ONE ELSE!!!!!!!!!! And if you can't do that, then just don't pick up the phone. But you can't run from bullies all your life. And this woman is a bully!!!!!!!!!! Stand up for yourself. Don't allow her to push you around. The only reason why she is>>>is because your allowing it.|`|5b77077e70b84dab7414213e14225d32aa	There is no rule that says you have to explain yourself to her. Just don't answer her phone calls, and she will eventually leave it alone.  Why would you want to answer the phone and listen to an earful of abuse?|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	Just say you have fall out of love from your husband and his family too.  Admit that you need this 2 to balance the marriage and if she still blurr change your number!|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I would NOT be talking to anyone in my spouses family who is demanding reasons and cursing me out.  It's none of her freaking business why you've chosen to divorce her son.  I wouldn't be answering her calls at all.|`|6BhTjwoNaa	Dont take her calls. You dont owe her explainations.I feel sorry for you, as if she werent like she is your marriage may have had a better chance.Screen your calls.If she should call from a strange number , when you hear her hang up right away.Dont tell her anything, she is too nosey.Don't let her intimidate you any longer, you deserve peace of mind and happiness.Your reaction is within your power. You will feel stronger each time she tries to intimidate you, shut her completely out.Cursing alone to you is really bad, she is a mean, spiteful woman.How sad.|`|onbwN4csaa	Tell her nothing.  If you have to say anything. Just say you all should know by now.  Then hang up.|`|BItkg1f0aa	block her number, or something....i feel bad for you    damn in laws..not all of them though
SQyVBEIwaa	Maybe like a pretty necklace with a heart on it?    Girls are suckers for stuff like that! I do agree that flowers are too soppy, especially if you aren't in a relationship with her yet.    But a charmed necklace or bracelet is a great idea!
K2QwEM4raa	Of course there are. Next time at the mall look at the couples and you will notice some not so good looking girls with very good looking guys and the other way around. It depends on the person. And if you marry for looks I bet there will be a second marriage for real love.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Yes it is possible.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Why would it be impossible? Surely not every single man on earth is exactly alike? You've lumped us all in one category without any other option!    Give a guy a chance!|`|aOjMf5SPaa	yes|`|KNcZTbqQaa	Um yes, totally possible (I have seen it from time to time)|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	I think there are some guys and girls that go for heart over looks, I am going out with the most amazing guy but hes not the best looking guy ive ever seen but hes still lovely and he has a heart of gold he would do anything for me and im guessing there are guys that feel the same about girls.|`|AA11879518	Not likely.|`|ZfWMnvW7aa	ive seen this many times before, hot guys with crappy girls, not in looks but in attitude also. you can def find a guy who likes you for you just stop searching he will come, but if you're interested in this particular guy then be friends first, get a feel for what he likes and if hes right for you|`|GfphOIdOaa	sure. The problem is, does your hot looking guy know you exist? Most men are first attracted by what the see, before they are attracted by what they feel. If you can manage to make yourself noted and he likes what he feels, looks are not as important anymore.   Also, don't doubt yourself. You are surely an attractive girl and with a little make up and clothing could be a real vamp! (please send pictures of result) (just kidding). Believe in yourself and your higher self esteem will make you many times more attractive|`|AA11289793	Yeah it defiantly happens, and besides "Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder"|`|Un9CElCaaa	i have dated 3 hot girls. they all turned out to be stuck up b*****s. i finally have met someone with a big heart and even though most guys would call her hot too it is her personality that im attracted to. i would definitely date a less attractive girl as long as she is a good person. the girl i like is like finding a needle in a haystack. good looking and a big heart but if she wasnt as good looking i would still want her. if he doesnt like u for who u are he is not worth your time|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Im an attractive guy and i dont always go for the hotties  I'd rather have a really kind hearted girl that doesn't look spectacular than a hot girl who is a total b****|`|gRsuXxkbaa	all men arent that shallow|`|41NyT8oPaa	Yes it's possible ,..... some hot guy are just show off, some of them go for the heart and don't care about looks.|`|gvbK8VHgaa	if he is like stevie wonder or ray charles maybe there is a chance|`|e6XFt05yaa	of course it's possible if she is a great person to be with whatever she looks like, then yes a guy could fall in love with that girl.|`|pfC2eD9Qaa	yes|`|SQyVBEIwaa	I wish there was!|`|K6KHL9lNaa	Well knowing guys, if he loved a not-so-hot girl he most likely wouldn't want anyone knowing that|`|rItaulkDaa	Anything is possible honestly but unfortunately a lot of guys can't get past the looks and see the heart. It does happen though.   Two sayings  Beauty is only skin deep...  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|e9js4PDaaa	Yes, for me as a guy, I don't really look at the face of the girl. I prefer better attitude. If the girl is not hot but good and intelligent, she's still in the line of beautiful girls. Like Ugly Betty =D|`|zYnArpdIaa	Of course, loving somebody isn't about the outside, it's about the inside, talking to each other, doing cool stuff together.  The outside is a trigger but so many people so many tastes....|`|25HBvSxGaa	guys who with girls soley for their appearance do not find love. sure, looks are important to some people, but noone will find true love without discovering something much much deeper than appearances.    yes, it is possible for a hot looking guy to love a girl who is not hot at all. but remember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|AA10269450	Sometimes it takes a few tries before a guy figures it out. I mean figures out that beauty is more than skin deep. As for me there is much to be said for the qualities that lie within. Besides, any girl can be beautiful to someone.|`|vAyvv5ngaa	of course it is!ive seen a lot of them actually..:)|`|LomICtW1aa	It has nothing to do with looks.  A good guitarist will go for how a guitar sounds rather than how it looks.    It is those who wish to flash their guitar around, will buy the latest and most trendy..|`|1uRUaSblaa	Looks may be the 1st things that draws a guy to a gal but  it is usually their  personalities  ( &  heart conditions)   that dictate how much further they both can go.    A so-so looking gal can still be attractive to a 'hot' man   who spends enough time to see and appreciate the real   beauty in her.

Are you clear as to why you want to go for the holidays to London?  Where will you be residing, how much monies do you have etc .... when Mother says NO ... you can either accept that or talk her nicely into trusting you with all the details SHE wants to know!|`|7jwHnDixaa	Tell her all the advantages of going, also offer to do something for her in return for you to go on the trip.|`|tg9D0tVGaa	my mums the same way  she wont let me go to france and i live in london  but if u get every detail possible   accomondation prices things you will be doing ect   then she should let you  thats what i do  oh btw its realli cold in london right now, like heavy snow
7dPwXcItaa	Go out with his friend, ur ex bf will get jealous, promise 2 neva cheat again, then u'll live happily ever after!!!    ok lol, that's a bit too exaggerated.|`|jDOeA6wtaa	if you love him....be with him...but it'll be better if you think as many times as you can to be sure of what you want to do...
yvhMspYBaa	try and convince one of the pair (Whoever you're closest to) it's not true and hope they'll set the other straight,  good luck  x|`|8FbJjRpwaa	didnt understand u|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	the thing is not clear, but i would say think b4 u talk...  it's a complete waste of time to talk BS n then realize that its BS...|`|e4mgLrGlaa	just dont care...the person will realise their  fault/guilty soon........|`|URsRqqCcaa	SLAP EM IN THE FACE  AND GO GET SOME ICECREAM
d1guDJzyaa	Stop being so desperate!! Wait until he even shows a interest in you first before you decide to try and kiss him|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just be more flirty and look straight in the eye.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	Grow some balls (so to speak) and kiss him.    If you can't manage that, tell him "I want you to kiss me".|`|AA10852244	You gonna need friends to ask him if he like you first, if yes let them hook you guys up, if it worked make a deal and both kiss each other at the same time.       If you wanna practice kissing just tell me ^.^|`|6fZzRFIXaa	ask him  i bet his shy|`|shvhgzXeaa	Get the guy alone and move close to him and look him in the eyes.|`|xLYKoDluaa	Y do girls hate making the first move!? Lol no offence, stare at his mouth when you are with him that normally signals that u want to kiss someone and he should pick up on this|`|YLnZRMA6aa	flash your ****|`|rSdmxlBNaa	Knock him out with a lamp and it'll be easy darlin'|`|JhnDqebJaa	well grab him and pull him to ya then kiss him then kock him out
MC1V0VDuaa	he puts is hand on your head to get deeper    and he puts his hand on the small of your back to hit your G spot     if you look at the pick of me and my wife you can tell she is tiny too i do the head thing but as far as the hand on your lower back tell him to use a pillow.|`|shvhgzXeaa	If it does not bother you and it does not hurt you then just enjoy it. It probably is a dominance thing. As for the tilting hips it might affect how deep he goes.|`|b82ybE3gaa	my boyfriend does this too and he says its so that he can have better....motion, like a good grip i suppose, so he can pound better.|`|fc4qv3vPaa	hes probably just making for better positioning/angles|`|Ys10tX6Yaa	it probably gives him betta control and force , or he jus has nower to put his hands|`|269a22963227ace39bc99fecd062b0d5aa	You are correct with both of your assumptions. He holds your head for a feeling of a control over you and he lifts your hips for a better angle. Many people put a pillow or even a small ramp to get the right position.|`|v8dkk5gvaa	he doesnt know how to screw. thats what it sounds like.|`|bS8Lzb9caa	he is obviously more experienced at sex than you are, or you would  not be asking these questions.    yes, he is trying to keep you from sliding away from him, and tilt you  into the best position for contact with his pelvis. enjoy the ride..!!|`|og3Tmn0saa	People do things during sex. If you don't really care, and he realizes you don't care, maybe that's just a more comfortable thing for him to do? That would place his head pretty close to yours.  As for lifting your back, yeah, that will affect the angle of your vagina. Could be for deepness or just better angle. He might not even realize it and just does it because it feels better. Ask him?|`|LdLt0vpRaa	i do that at times(holding my gf's head) but not all the time,mostly to look into her eyes i.e i'm on top n my elbows r around her shoulders then i run my fingers either thru her hair or just rub her face before i kiss her..if thats wat u talking bout he's just trying to be passionate..then the 2nd one has to do with ur body(mid section and ****) rubbing agains him..dont think it has anything to do with how deep(not speaking from a professional point of view,just personal)...it still boils down to trying to be passionate....u could joke bout it when u tell him u're uncomfortable when he holds ur head so u dont hurt his feelings|`|pjRnFrexaa	It makes him feel better... More comfty position...|`|e4Knq4GWaa	I think he is just enjoying your feminine body. I think he enjoys bringing it closer to himself, and enjoys the fact that you are small enough to pull against him. My husband does it and he is not controlling at all.|`|N1CJO4bJaa	I think he is a perfect player of intercourse.Let him do what he want. It increase your joy. So there is no harm in it. He is not dominating you, rather he has a technique and simply using with you for your both the satisfaction.
RoEyFm5yaa	SO YOU WOULD BE PERFECTLY FINE WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND TALKING,TEXTING,EMAILING OTHER GUYS?AND FLIRTING IS OK TOO?IF YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT DONE TO YOU,DON'T DO IT TO HER.|`|AA10852244	This guy just wants to get attention, he has been asking stupid questions the whole day.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	y do u need to email othe girls ******?isnt ur gf enuf for u?|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	i put girls in my phone as nicknames. i have rome, chu- chu, banana peel, liquid cocaine, shenanigans and etc. so when i get a text or a call and she asks me who it is i just say its a guy and its too long of a story to explain nicknames.  i often put girls in my phone with the same nickname as one of my friends with a letter or two different so i just say its my best friend or a hockey buddy.    it's fool proof. remember the "fool" part of that phrase.
d5ec0d14b20f77a346c8dcc04807a042aa	Have u tried being urself? It might lead to a second date ;)|`|K5uoaetaaa	Act naturally.|`|EMcwjhZ4aa	One shot of Patron. Just one.|`|YgZDXDgFaa	They say its better not to kiss on the first date, or seem like you overly 'want' your date.  I mean, i think the first date is about getting to know the other person, seeing what things you have in common etc. So it would probably be good if you're natural and act as if he/she were a mate of yours (to a certain extent).  I think that building common ground and having fun is way more important than trying to kiss and hold hands and basically trying to 'get into a relationship'. If that makes sense?!    Im going on a date this week, im nervous too, eeeeek|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	like yourself|`|37PYnKr9aa	Be yourself. If you dont like that, have a few drinks before they meet you at the restaurant!!!

COZ IF U GO WITH HIM HE WANTS TO USE U FOR SEX AND HE'LL GO TO JAIL COZ ITS ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	he is almost a young adult..you're still under age, wait for another 4 years then you'll be fine|`|eVK2zZsOaa	No, I think he is too old for you and your parents might be very upset. He needs to find someone his own age.|`|vpoP8ksHaa	hey man,  i totally would.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	no, quite dangerous for both of you|`|R2CyLXTHaa	You can't be serious can you?  No, it is NOT ok. It is not right! The whole thing sounds wrong, really it does.|`|DxYwNFdhaa	NONONONONONO !!!|`|dCMi5rjdaa	ummmmmmmmmmmm    NO.    it's not o.k.  you're 13, he's 17.  I know, that's only 4 yrs, but you are a MINOR.  and he could get into BIG BIG trouble.|`|q5bYAmgpaa	As long as you're comfortable with it and he's not pressuring you into doing anything then its okay|`|tC6MG0nyaa	no no.. i dont think u shud...|`|sDYtDDE4aa	no no no  dear seek in your own age.|`|Ys10tX6Yaa	heyy im 14 and going out with an 18 year old everythinks your stupid right? well if hes always talking to you phoning you up (not you phoning him up wasting your credit) always telling you i love you and stuff and he wants 2 see you then its your descion if he wants sex and you know it forget him! dont think about other people jus think what you want!!!|`|og3Tmn0saa	Go for it ;)  But be STRONG. Make sure things happen the way you want, not the way he wants.|`|sVkSrUqNaa	no no umm no|`|e4Knq4GWaa	No. I am sure you are a wonderful girl, but a 17 year old who wants to date a 13 year old is just creepy.|`|qCBkCMlWaa	it is quite a big age gap since you're under 16, if you were both over 18 say you was 18 and he was 22 i'd tell you to go for it. However since your not i wouldn't recommend it, but its your life not mine :)|`|EGoLQyOtaa	i dont think u shud.........

Did you talk to anybody first...it dont sound like it!!!    First off, when you found out you should of kick her ***!!!! then got rid of him and found another guy. It sound like you forgot about your feelings and happiness and obvously they could care less about how you felt when they were both screwing around on you. It sound like to me you need to worry more about you. Now your best friend is married to your man that you invested time into. Your best friend dont deserve happiness in this situation because its not right.     As for him, you dont need him. The same way she got him that's how she will lose him. He will do the same thing to her. Be glad she took that jerk, now you can get something better!!! It is your fault to encourage something so stupit. but it is not your fault what happen. This gives you the oppurtunity to find something bigger and better and leave that mess alone. it wont go far trust me!!!|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	What the H*ll??!

You were wrong to allow your friend to get treated like royalty.    Your best friend wasn't being a good friend at all. She should've tried on your shoes, she was being really self centered.    Your ex cheated on you. He was supposed to marry her, to help her. It's his fault.    He was wrong to blame you for everything.   Ditch them both!|`|b6LcC0CEaa	They have issues that they need to get over so they don't wind up warping their baby. Poor kid :( As for you, get as far away from that mess as possible. You have been too nice (almost a doormat) so far... you are not responsible for anything they did or whatever situation they are in right now. They were "adults" enough to have unprotected sex, and they are adult enough to make their own big boy and big girl desicions. If they really didnt want this, they wouldnt have done it. Get away from them and have your own happy life!|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi, can I call you Xena ? Like that warrior.    You're so amazing that your letter can put a lot of trouble people to shame  and when someone read it, seems like everybody starts to want a part of you.  I really loves a girl someone like you, so matured yet so sensitive and are  very patient with all your surroundings, quite alert.    I actually don't have much a comment, as you've did the right things for both your ex b/f and best friend but too bad that your best friend had betray you.    And you're so awesome that you still be able to go for the wedding and to  congratulate them.  And 1 important thing, that is, NO. NO, you're not INSANE.  You're simply irresistible.  And just remember, there's not a single thing is your fault and you make sure that you got no regrets about it. OK ?  And I seems not to know what I'm typing anymore, cuz your letter is so well  arrange and is neat and tidy as well and everybody seems to understand fully well about it.  And boy, you can write songs too, that suits me 300% and I'm totally into you.

AA11614449	Good for him! If he believe in sex before marriage then maybe he feel he wouldn't be able to control himself if his pants came off.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	maybe there's rumors about you and like have herpies or something people are so mean.  or maybe he wants you guys to wait.  or maybe hes selfconsciouss about his thing down there haha|`|19TSkwaKaa	Maybe hes just not ready yet|`|3jhLIUKyaa	maybe hers shy because you guys have never done it|`|p0a1dB28aa	He was scared and intimidated. Do be to pushie next time. Make him work for it!|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Maybe he doesn't want to be a father.  Are you two ready to support a baby?|`|shvhgzXeaa	Here is a little hint- Its against the law.  You should be appreciative of your guy for holding out until you can legally have sex. Its either that or he is just not ready.|`|vaacRAi0aa	Because he didn't want to?|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	He probably loves you and wants to make your first time special. He may also want you both to be legal as well?|`|IkWcwsj8aa	ask him|`|7YkO9zmOaa	He's probably embarrased or more likely not comfortable on the setting. I personally don't like taking my pants off unless I know the area (I know that noone will come around knocking).    My bet is that if you were at his house he wouldn't have minded. For all he knows someone may come barging in your house.    That's just a possibility.    EDIT: HAHA! I doubt he's affaid of sex, or wants to wait! Besides you didn't ask him to take his undies off, just his pants. He's probably, like I said, afraid of your parents or someone arriving before he can hike his pants up.|`|ldqQDwI4aa	Maybe hes Shy!    Don't be too pushy!|`|59HXAtRHaa	Hes not ready!  U put him in an awkward postion which made him uncomfortable..      He'll let u know when hes ready!!  Don't rush things!!|`|Ys10tX6Yaa	maybe he  wants to make sure he's having sex with the right girl.|`|1968df56bb4d12221cfe3e719b7c1488aa	babies...!

Maybe he would feel better if u guys were older.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	Sex and relationships are big, powerful things, and this is very often overwhelming and un-nerving for young people.    Don't take it personally.  It's probably not a rejection so much as a self-defense thing so that his mind doesn't break in half.    If you can both handle it, then the best thing to do is to just ask him.    Good communication trumps all else.    Good luck!
ysBlIlmSaa	uh... are you kidding?|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	im in yr 9 and i think you should like him from afar otherwise you will get bullied by other kids and he will be freaked out that he is a gay crush|`|shvhgzXeaa	Whatever you feel is right|`|pIKPFpbiaa	He is fit.

uzXwM0Qzaa	Hey girl, relax. First, you must know if the guy is honest and sincere with you. If you are sure about it, then you give him so much love that he wouldn't want to be away from you. Give him lots of attention, physical love and you will see that you will get all these in reciprocal and your relationship will be perfect or near perfect!!!!!!!|`|19TSkwaKaa	Calm down!  Go with the flow.  Think about his feelings before your do somethign that could break up the relationship|`|AA12212403	OK, my answer is to SLOW down here... it's only been a week.  Relax, be honest in whatever you say or do and have some fun.  If it is meant to be, it will happen, if not move on.  You sound really young.  Guys like girls who are interested in them, so ask him about himself, his hopes and dreams.  Get to know him really well so that it's not just a physical attraction.  Tell him your hopes and dreams.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	the best advice to be given is to just chill out, be yourself and do't try too hard.|`|JOVbmsF7aa	jus be the opposite of urself then u kno wot i mean -lyk woteva u did rong in past relationships do the exact opposite this time -its worth a shot ^_^|`|yGPRntXFaa	just be you, stay sweet, look your best, show honesty and loyalty.. stay keeping it real with him.. change your routines every couple of weeks so he doesnt know your next move and gets bored... do cool things . listen to what he likes and tell him what you like and if he likes you and cares for you as much........then that will grow... of DEFINITELY LET HIM HAVE HIS SPACE TOO................. dont overwhelm him with LONG TERM DATING questions and statements... go out with him, do lots of fun things and easy cool things like go to movies every week or two if you can afford it and keep it interesting........ if he ever changes like stops calling or texting you... give it a day or two then ask him if everything is ok........ . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know... Have a great day... BTW, I'm Alex from New York and I'm 31....... just a bit about me... The End....|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Drink your milk.|`|mzadMLQgaa	RELAX WOMAN!!!   just wait til there is a possible problem and resolve it then!! ask us when there is a problem, not when u feel there will be a problem later on|`|3240244337e315e4b6abfceee9445797aa	You have only been together for a week. You know the cliched old saying, it takes two to tango? Well it's true. It takes two to work a relationship. You can't be the only one trying to make it stronger. Although you shouldn't try too hard, just let things fall into place. Learn from your past relationships. If you did something wrong before, learn from it and try not to repeat that same mistake with this relationship.|`|7vJdFEPQaa	Hi just be you're self guys like that.....    my relationship broke down because i didn'tt act myself and i would'nt do things around the house... i said honey if you want me to do something for you, you have to ask me so i know what she wanted
pVnUhYLQaa	Sometimes it goes "floppy" immediately, sometimes it stays hard for 5 minutes or so. It depends, not really sure on what though.|`|hoBREUGLaa	Depends how good the sex was. Or bad.|`|AA11571111	Depends up on the age dear.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	It seems to depend on the guy, his age, experience level, or whatever.  My guy lasts about two minutes.
8rM5W0EBaa	your boy friend seems a bit on the boring side. but make sure you dint cheat on him ! no one will trust you then.

YuVSDBkzaa	There's a lot more to having a beautiful wife and marriage then physical appearance. Just remember to never give up and never look outside your marriage when you are having problems (i.e. affairs). Communicate and don't sweat the small stuff.

Then tell him your plans and see if he can work something out.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	As noble as your plan is, <br>  <br>  1  Take a little bit more time.  Her father would probably say the same thing.<br>  <br>  2  Talk to someone else in her family to see how he would feel about this.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you have a better understanding of him than I do, and you don't think he would have a problem with it, the sooner the better.|`|rawz0RJuaa	my guy asked my dad about a week before he proposed.<br>  my parents were not really a part of it though like what you are talking about. he just asked out of respect|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Now so he can plan and give u some guy to guy advice.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Great for you! <br>  As soon as you are sure she's the ONE and you are sure she will say "yes" when you ask, then that's the time to talk to dear ol' Dad.<br>  I'd make his participation optional, however, I personally wouldn't want to be involved in the actual engagement with my daughter.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	I would ask him as soon as possible and then keep him updated with the specifics.

I don't think her dad will go for that in that short of time.|`|t81MEJ82aa	What's too early? If you want him to participate, then why not give him time to plan according to his schedule and that so he doesn't have to pay for higher ticket prices. It's cool that you want to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage but nothing wrong with being considerate.
kL8BzsBNaa	World of Warcraft is by far 10 times better than Guild Wars in both PVP and RP. Let alone the graphics, WOW also has many more features that keep it always interesting. You can get mounts (horse, rams, raptors, wolves, etc.), train in various proffessions such as mining, fishing (which is actually fun). Even the guilds in WOW just as good if not better, the only thing is you cant have your own guild base like in guild wars. The main thing here is that WoW isnt just a one time payment like Guild Wars. You have to keep paying every month to play WoW unless you pay online and its about 70 for 6 months which if you think about it isnt bad seeing as you only need to pay a little over 10 for one month. Its really up to you but if you say that you have been saving up for a game i would go with Guild Wars since you might not want to spend money every month. I did it because i had a job at the time and i have both games. Let me tell you, i got over Guild Wars in a month but WoW kept me playing till i quit my job to concentrate on school.|`|syDn1z0Haa	well my brother was addictied to wow and i thought it was an okay game
C5pVfdzwaa	Ask him what in hell he actually wants.  He needs to make up his mind.  Tell him to decide what he wants and do it and not put you in the middle of it. <br>  Tell her that you can't fix this for her and its up tp him what he wants to do.
wia9SXCPaa	Forget the therapist, talk to the man.  I mean really talk to him.  Don't be afraid to tell him everything.  You have nothing to loose at this point because being in a marriage like you describe simply sucks!  Trust me Im there right now.  Your christian values don't tell you to be miserable the rest of your life do they.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Seek counseling, either together or alone. They can take an unbiased look at the issues, and help work them out.|`|HRegfSrEaa	I feel you there. I feel the same with my husband. I love him so much...but at the same time, he drives me nuts. I feel like I am always putting his needs before my own without any apprecation. I try to show and tell him how much I appreciate his working so hard for our family. Without him going to work we woudnt have anything. But i dont feel I get the same respect or appreciation. I feel like he also doesnt compliment me for anything. I know I dont want to leave him too...but at times i feel like i have no choice but to leave so that I am not depending on him for fullfilment, appreciation, or complements. I think my husband doesnt know how good he has it, and he wont unless he sees life without me. Its scary for me though....i grew up christian too, so I know what you mean. I dont want a divorce, but at the same time, I feel like he needs to be without me for awhile to realize how much I do.|`|WAJWWKKTaa	My husband and I just recently went through this.  He complained that I wasn' t interested in him anymore and he was thinking of leaving me.  What he didn't realize, was that I had felt that way about him for years.  I, like you,  was disgusted by every little thing he did.  I decided to make a list.  First I listed the reasons I was a bad wife.  Then I listed why I was angry at him.  It was so therapeutic and made me feel so much better, that I decided to share the list with him. He was so grateful that I admitted my faults first, that he was more open to listening to my complaints about him.  It was great getting everything in the open.  Plus writing it down made it easier to say what I had to without saying it wrong.  You might be surprised that he is feeling the same way you are.  Also, he might not be the type who feels comfortable giving out compliments.  Maybe his lack of complaining is his way of saying that you are doing things right.  But I advise you to talk to him.
cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	Short answer: Yes.<br>  In fact, you can get pregnant from the precum.
nxEoR9CEaa	Sounds like sexual harassment.  Approach him, tell him that his behavior and advances are not welcome and if he would discontinue asking questions about your personal life, taking pictures, and encroaching on your personal space.  Inform him that his actions make you uncomfortable, and can be viewed as sexual harassment.  Following that conversation, meet with human resource and inform them of the situation.|`|421b1247395dca6ee67c1d6b736731a7aa	This is sexual harrassment and you should talk to his superior.  Do not feel intimidated by him. If he somehow managed to get you fired for it you could sue the company for tons of money, so companies tend to take these complaints seriously.|`|axdgDiGMaa	go and talk to someone in human resorces and tell them that your boss's innuendos are making you uncomfortable.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	I think you're playing too much into it.  Just be professional and short with him.  Don't indicate to him that you're interested in him outside of work in any way, including as friends.  You may be misinterpreting his actions and you don't want to get him in trouble and jeaprodize his job if you don't have your facts straight.  If you're wrong you will start an office buzz and that can trash your reputation at work.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	If he has a supervisor or if there is someone above him at the company go to them.  If there is a human resources or HR office go to them.  I would write a letter and present it to them with details of everything he does.  Write in quotes exactly what he has said to you and what you said to him.  I don't even know if should continue working there.  You could file a complaint against him and most likely win a sexual harassment suit.  That he is taking your picture is against all the laws and I would be super pissed.  These questions and the flirting are completely wrong too. Please talk to someone and make sure they know if something is not done you will contact the authorities.
C5pVfdzwaa	He is not your daddy and he doesn't get to decide who you do or do not go somewhere with.|`|plBXp91Daa	I think this is ridiculous that you have to ask him first when you want to hang out with a friend. Does he ask your permission when he wants to hang out with his friend(s)? It look like he want's to control you and maybe don't really trust you.A relationship is based on trust and not control each other. Even if you were married it isn't right that someone controls you and you have nothing to say.|`|mMBzpldbaa	no, you should not have to ask his permission for anything, and still wouldn't even if you were married. it seems like this behaviour should be classed as warning signs for the future. if he is acting like this now, i can promise you he will get worse.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	I think you know the answer to this question don't you?  As you said you are not married, so just imagine if you were. Doesn't seem like a good thing to take into a relationship does it?|`|3LdKvdYtaa	HELL NO!! You dont belong to him and you shouldn't answer to anyone. So tell that ************ that you do what you wanna do when you wanna do it and if he doesnt like it he can go *********.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Married or not you are not his property.  Don't let this guy or any guy walk on you.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	I don't think you should have to "ask" him anything..he is not your daddy.  But every relationship there is a respect boundary and if you are committed to him you do need to let him know that you are going out and you will be home in a few hours.  If he can't handle that then that is his problem.|`|wYvJ1RVFaa	You know what. My relationship is kinda like this too. And to tell you the truth, Yes its very wrong for him to act like such a kid. He may not show it but he wants total control of you. And why? Because he doesn't trust you. Which probably your thee greatest girlfriend around. Some guys are just stupid and need to get a hold of themselves. <br>  I bet you have pointless fights just cause he don't trust you?...Set him Straight! it if that doesn't work, kick his *** to the curb. :]<br>  Cuz girly your worth way more!|`|yBtldCU7aa	Knowing my bf, i think he would be the same way,<br>  But I don't really like going out,<br>  Yea its kind of wrong.<br>  He should really trust you.<br>  Sometimes guys say they do, but thy don't.<br>  Or maybe he doesn't trust your friend.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Are you dating him or does he own you?  Even if you were married, ask permission?  I don't think so!<br>  <br>  In all honesty, why would you even come close to thinking that's okay?|`|5oTxOJocaa	You definitely shouldn't have to ask permission from him. I think you need to talk to him about this quickly and get it sorted, otherwise things could escalate...|`|CQsD09D6aa	It depends on the relationship. If it not ok with you, you should say so. If he does not respect your boundaries you may consider counseling or saying adios.|`|l0TxGogyaa	he has some problems then if they were boys i could see y but he`s got something rough with him
zG4QCxK7aa	you sound like me... had that with a guyfriend of mine, totally fell for him.. i was actually(and still) in love with him... however my friend got him instead and asked me if it was a problem they would go together and said that if i couldnt deal with it then she wouldnt do it.. so ive all this time been trying to get over him and its going better and better each time, just be happy for them no matter how hard it is, ive cried so much for him but now i realise he just isnt worth it, i see them kiss everyday right in front of my face, even when im still talking to my friend, and no matter how much it hurts, i can somehow cope with it, since they are both my friends, (he is less of a friend now, he hurt me so bad and it had nothing to do with love.) but i can still be happy for them, you are strong i know you can do this...however i do think your friend shouldve talked to you about this but i think shes too afraid to, since she knows how much u like him, my friend had tears in her eyes when she asked me and she was so scared i would ditch her from being my friend just talk to her about it in real, not on msn.|`|jg9w6IbQaa	forget about him. and her. if she was really your friend she wouldn't of said yes to him, no matter how much she liked him herself. if i told my friend how much i liked a guy and then she turns around and dates him, i'd be really upset. to me, that isn't a friend. i'm sorry that happened to you. <br>  <br>  if she says something about it to you, let her know it's bothering you because you thought she was your friend. i mean don't make it into this huge dramatic situation, but there's nothing wrong with letter her know how you feel.|`|xsYEJRJeaa	Some friend she is.<br>  It was so nice of you to try and be happy for them. You have tried. But I understand you just can't. Your friend betrayed you, the thing is though the boy probably had no idea that liked him when he asked her out. Tell her it hurts you that she would say yes to go out with him when you liked him all along. <br>  See what she says, but whats a friendship without trust? x
K1YHSR3oaa	the way that you tell them and the way that you handle their response is going to show a lot about your maturity and it's going to say a lot about whether or not you're ready to be married.  I think you should just sit down with them and tell them that you have thought this through and you think this is a good decisions.  If they disagree, tell them that you appreciate their feelings but you hope they will come to see why you have made your decision.|`|4EWCegiRaa	If you're not mature enough to talk to your parents about marriage, you are not mature enough to get married!|`|1oiUVWvYaa	i dated my ex for four and a half years, all through high school, we thought we were going to get married when i was out of high school, i loved him with all my heart. but then i fell out of love with him, and if we had gotten married like we wanted to, we would have had to divorce and it would have been bad. if you guys have no doubt in your hearts at all, and love eachother completely, then maybe it would work, but i wouldn't suggest telling your parents until you're engaged and have specific plans for marrying, not just wanting to marry.|`|t8swfyD4aa	honestly its not going to matter how your tell your parents. Your too young to be thinking about getting married. What about college? what about traveling? what about living on your own and experiencing life for a few years. Realistically speaking you will stand a better chance of staying together if you don't get married before you turn 25. If you're both so perfect for each other than waiting shouldn't be that hard.|`|v1xAKwJ4aa	well, tell your mom first (see 1 how to tell her), they're always much better than your dad, tell your mom to tell your dad, then discuss it after dinner one day, say something like so its ok i marry _______ (boyfriends name) or if they said no, than say why not? and come up with great things about him. >=)<br>  <br>  1.)

He doesn't love you enough. 2. He has a problem committing. 0r both.|`|pRF5LLloaa	It means that what he REALLY wants is to get in your pants.<br>  <br>  men and women see thing completely differently.  A MAN'S mind is focused almost entirely upon the physical act of sex.  A man's goal in life is to get laid.<br>  <br>  Women, on the other hand, look primarily for the emotional side -- "love".  Women need to express emotional lvoe, and they need to juear it expressed towards them. <br>  <br>  but men aren't very good at that. they just want to "get busy" and get it done with -- so they can move on to the next female.<br>  <br>  But suprisingly, women STILL haven't figured this out!  Women STILL think that when a man says "I love you", he probably means it.<br>  <br>  But that is NOT the case.  When a man says "I love you" it is usually just words to get the woman "in the mood" so that she doesn't scream RAPE!<br>  <br>  So women get suckered into all kinds of relationships, waiting for the man to make good the promises.  She will finally give in and bed down, justifying tha action by saying "but I love him" when in fact what is really going on is that she is trying to trap him into making a committment.<br>  <br>  Both side need to stop playing games!  If HE makes a committment, then HE needs to stick with it.  SHE needs to stop believing that her man has somehow turned into a woman, and is suddenly capable of providing more than "lip service" to love. <br>  <br>  if a man wants to committ to one woman, then he buys her a ring and starts looking for a church.  Until that time, SHE needs to realize that any promises he makes are probably just intend to get her on her back.|`|5oTxOJocaa	I think he's scared of committing someone lifelong. I agree with Just Me Being Me, actions speak louder than words - maybe you should be slightly careful.|`|RtrqOqosaa	you sound way too good for this guy...|`|4EWCegiRaa	Why do you need a title?  You two supposedly love each other so much you can't breathe without each other, who needs a title?<br>  <br>  Sure, he probably can't commit to you because he probably doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with you since ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS and knowing you want to commit should make him want to do it just because he wants you to be happy (ya know, that thing called love where you want to make the other person happy), but hey, who am I to say anything...
PuQyYMM8aa	Please excuse me if i have this situation all wrong... You kicked your husband out of the house because he got into a fight with your parents? I am guessing that you both live with your parents? <br>  <br>  If i was him, i am not so sure i could live in that situation either. I don't know what the fight was about, and that would have a lot to do with my answer. If you don't live with your parents, then you just chose your parents over your husband, and that is a No No. Again, i don't know what kind of husband he is, but you need to be there for your husband.<br>  <br>  You both need to talk and get a place of your own, together. So that you can raise the baby with a family. Divorce should always be a very last resort!|`|plBXp91Daa	Well i know it is hard to choose between your parents or your husband but when your husband is right i would choose his side. If you still have the pregnancy test you can show him that you don't lying .|`|HRIbmp67aa	you know what - he'll get over that, BUT you need to grow the hell up right now.  if my husband EVER defended his mother against me - i would've left him too.  my husband's mother is not his immediate family anymore....I am!<br>  <br>  *edit* - honey - you didn't lose your husband because of them, you lost your husband because of yourself.  if you wanted  things to calm down then you should have said - honey could you please take a walk so things can calm down.  not get the eff out! duh!  you really need to decide - YES - CHOOSE, because you already chose when you got married.  HIM or THEM.  that's it - get your family out of your parents' house and grow up.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You are in the wrong here. You two should not be living with your parents any ways. Grow up. And don't expect him to come back. You need to defend your husband. If you can't afford your own place, you shouldn't be having sex and children.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You are not giving us much to work on.  Please add to your comments why the argument  with your parents and why did you kick him out.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Sounds like you are living with your parents and taking  their side   Wow  that makes him feel real manly ! Girl  grow up|`|Wv592rOqaa	The dynamic and love between a child and their parents and a person and their spouse is so different that feeling you should forsake your parents for your spouse is just unreasonable.  <br>  <br>  People think that marriage replaces a family - in reality is suppose to extend the family relationship - hence the words in-laws.  <br>  <br>  Your husband is playing a game of emotional blackmail, otherwise if he divorces you over something like this - he did not love you in the first place.  <br>  <br>  I'd tell him - I admit I made a mistake, but your divorcing me says a lot more about how you feel about loving me than my trying to protect you in the wrong way.  Tell him, this is all new to you and you will make a few more mistake as will he before you both get it right - is he going to be immature and want a divorce each time the marriage has to get over a bump or hurdle?   <br>  <br>  Let him know you will be waiting for him when he returns.  I guarantee you he will be back - unless there is more to this story than you are telling - and he was planning on escaping anyway.|`|kyaCKtFHaa	go see him show him you are pregnant. Then explain to him face to face why did what you did . Hes hurt and loves you too. It will take time just fight for your man find him everyday show him you love him. But plz take care of your self you now have a baby to worry about. and stress can hurt the baby <br>  <br>  best wishes|`|fc1n9vBjaa	If your husband doesn't believe you about something like that then it seems you have bigger issues, ie. trust, paranoia, etc.|`|dD5uhH8naa	from the sound of it you all live qwith your parents so you could move out and get your own place and that would cut down on the arguments|`|wia9SXCPaa	Go to him, show him the pregnancy test.|`|yQfaj7c2aa	It is never fun to be stuck in the middle, and maybe once your hubby has a chance to cool off he'll see this. What I can tell you is that I wouldn't have allowed myself to be placed in the middle you are essentially going to have someone vital in your life very upset with you if you do. You also need to remember that while your parents are important, they are your history. Your husband is your present and future, he is your immediate family now. I don't know what the problem is about, but at this point I would give him the opportunity to calm down before you continue to try to convince him back. You are 5 weeks pregnant and take it from somebody who has had two miscarriages, stress isn't good for the baby. Concentrate on taking care of you, on centering yourself, and on understanding the issues surrounding what has happened. When you have the opportunity to calmly discuss with him what happened, offer him a frank and heartfelt apology (this is all you can do). If he refuses to accept it then there isn't much more you can do at this point. You are only responsible for you and you'll know you did all you could to rectify the situation. <br>  Hang in there, and enjoy your pregnancy you are about to embark on a wonderful adventure! Your husband will hopefully come around...<br>  <br>  I just read the last part of your story and do have to say that his statement to your parents was not appropriate. No wonder your parents were upset. He may not be coming back at this point because he truly doesn't want to, the situation may have served his needs perfectly. I suggest you offer him that apology and allow him to get his head straight on what he wants... He may have stopped being invested in the marriage long before this incident. <br>  Take care of yourself!
avWiMKl7aa	If you love each other, then your parents have no right to seperate you two. Def. fight for it. Dont let it go if you still have feelings for each other. I wish you the best of luck with your girlfriend and i hope you proove your parents right.!!  =]
GsrLh50laa	If you can get your daughter's father to sign a consent form then it's easy and cheap to do. You can get everything you need to legally change a minor's name at - <a href="http://www.legalformsbank.biz/namechange.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.legalformsbank.biz/namechange...</a> - and you can learn more about the process there.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You might not want to rush into this. My bf's parents divorced when he was 3 and his mother changed his name to his step-father's name after they married. But she was only married to his step-father for 4 years. As an adult, he now has established a relationship with his birth father, but neither he nor his mother have anything to do with the step-father whose name he now has. He is still bitter with his mother for changing his name.|`|AA11604319	You will need a court order to change her name on the birth certificate and more than likely you will need her FATHER'S consent.  In order for your fiance to adopt her, her father will have to sign over his rights and give his consent.<br>  <br>  No matter what you do, the child will alway be your ex's daughter.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Don't change her name unless you have her biological fathers permission.  It will come back to bite you if you don't do it the right way.  It may feel like the right thing to do right now, but what about when she is older. He has rights too.<br>  <br>  Sorry, probably not what you want to hear.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Depends on how many time you get married and change her name !     Think of your child  dim-witt|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Your fiance would have to legally adopt your daughter in order for her to adopt his surname. I'm not sure what the exact channels are for this, but there are legal documents and court dates that will need to be dealt with, and the father of your daughter will more than likely have to agree to it unless you bring him to court and prove his neglect of the child. Of course if he hasn't seen her in ages, this would not be difficult to prove. It will require additional court dates, of course, but even for the adoption process you will most likely require the services of an attorney.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if your fiance adopts your daughter, your ex will no longer have any financial obligation to help support your daughter. I'm sure this a non-issue in your case, but it's a fact worth mentioning.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MPYQ2Mfuaa	i guess you can change her last name but you have to do it threw <br>  court|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I'm pretty sure you'd have to get his permission|`|KZlgdMeEaa	im not familiar with the laws in your state but im guessing u could call an attorney and they would tell u.
d2fcf78a4441e801854c7b22e08d60b8aa	Why on earth would he call you to tell you about it? And why did you promise not to tell? I think that he is playing rather juvenile game and I wouldn't get involved.<br>  <br>  If you see him with your friend give him a quizzical look, he might explain himself to you. I would discourage my friend in her relationship. I would tell a really close friend, I wouldn't want to see her being messed about with. Make it clear that you have concerns about telling her, you don't want to disrupt her friendship with the guy nor do you want to break a promise but you feel it was important that she knows.|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	Even a fish wouldn't get in trouble if he kept his mouth shut.

5DJzp6bMaa	When you can Support Yourself and have a career, Take care of Yourself First then that way If things Dont Work out Your Not stuck like most People who say i cant Leave my Spouse I cant Support Myself.<br>  The Only Person you can Really Honestly Count on for takeing care of you in This Life is You.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Normally I would say there is no "right age" for marriage...It's when you are mature enough to handle a relationship and have met the right person to do so with...<br>  <br>  But if you need a number for class, I'd say 25 years or older.|`|IXskJPlVaa	After the legally permissible age anytime you are comfortable it is fine. Biologically - anytime after 18 is okay. Marriage is a union of two persons - there can be n reasons and no reason at all - just the feeling to be together. Even sex has a role. Differs from individual to individual. Best of luck.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I would say to never get married before the age of 25, and ideally maybe more like 27 or 28.<br>  <br>  I know I am going to get a million thumbs down for this, but seriously...<br>  <br>  You have so much growing and you change so much, what you want out of life, your views on the world.  So when you get married to young there is a higher likey chance of divorce because the person you were when you were 20 is not likely to be the same person when you are 28.  If you do not both change and adapt to each other together then the marriage will fail.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|OmzJq7EIaa	No right age, some people are ready at 21, some people should wait till they're 40.  And some people have no business every uttering the words I do.<br>  <br>  I'd say most people should wait until they are at least 24-25.|`|wia9SXCPaa	We were both 23 and just finished college!
GHnkKwl3aa	lol Sounds like you had a good day, played guitar, kissed a guy....<br>  <br>  Don't let your Mom, Jake's Mom, or even Jake pressure you into dating Jake. You do what your heart tells you. If your heart tells you you shouldn't date Jake and stay as friends, stay as friends. If your heart tells you you like Jake and want to date him, date him.<br>  <br>  What have you got to loose? You know that he likes you, he kissed you!|`|M6PsYn56aa	follow what your heart wants to do!<br>  do you like him?<br>  you only live once so if you do like him.. go for it! lol :)|`|ipRIrjcyaa	First of all, do you like Jake?  If you do, you should.  It's ok to talk to your mom about it to.  I'm sure that jake's mom would probably understand as well because she's probably been in a similar situation before.  If you don't want to go out with jake, explain to him and his mom that you don't want to.  good luck!!|`|1f93fe056a8941a67a5c0373d1ae4e0baa	No wonder she freaked, shes a church mom. I doubt that no one has ever felt like that towards the other but you do now and you should go for it and i try to emphasized that i am still friends with a good amount of my ex's.|`|cmfBO9cXaa	if he is hot-<br>  <br>  then go out with him! come on he is a musician and hot and your friend<br>  it sounds like a reli perfedct mixture to me!|`|e9h1AxGvaa	lol that was funny :) but the thing you should tell his mom is that this happened out of no where, neither of you had expected to feel this way for each other and that now that it happened you realize that you do actually like her son. Don't go into much detail though cuz moms always have attachments to their sons lol..so just tell her all the positive things about him and how he makes you feel but only do it if you really feel the same way about him. If you like him go out with him and experiment see how it works out..i wish you the best.|`|aIY39akoaa	well you should ask him out if you are close enough friends and tell his mum that you are in love and that you want to be with him(if you do)|`|ixHWpBcAaa	Whether u decide to pursue a relationship or not, u need to apologize to his mom. She was obviously upset and she trusted she could leave u two alone and u broke that trust (she'll respect u for it and she'll want to do some talking as well). Don't be surprised if she nixes ur alone time as well. As far as "jake" goes, go for it if u want to and if not let him down gently so u can salvage the friendship.
87XILDVBaa	Walk away. People like this are not worth the time and effort.|`|5oTxOJocaa	Leave them behind and move on. If you guys don't want anything to do with them, then there's no point in talking to them about what happened - and to be honest they don't seem worth it anyway. =)|`|ec9c35855e277d5525cc9446acda7f92aa	Or what.  <br>  <br>  Just walk away, Renee (song....).  You don't need to mess with, or be involved with, or talk to ppl who are like that.  Just walk away, don't look back. <br>  <br>  HTH.
GqI8wY8Iaa	Don't argue. Some guys don't like to be hung on and petted. Let him breath and make the first move. Then go with the flow. Apparently your overwhelming attention irritates him. Save your attention for yourself and let him earn his from you.|`|RtkB46peaa	Go read the book "The proper care and feeding of husbands".  It's all about how to get everything out of your husband, while keeping him happy, too.  Amazing concept, eh?  Oh, and it works.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	About abuse…<br>  <br>  How are you affected?<br>  <br>  * Are you unable or afraid to make decisions for yourself?<br>  * Do you do anything you can to please your partner or not upset him?<br>  * Do you make excuses for your partner's behaviour?<br>  * Are you forgetful, confused or unable to concentrate?<br>  * Have you noticed changes in your eating, sleeping, alcohol or drug use?<br>  * Have you lost interest or energy to do the things you used to?<br>  * Do you feel sick, anxious, tired or depressed a lot of the time?<br>  * Have you lost contact with your friends, family or neighbours?<br>  * Have you lost self-confidence and feel afraid that you could not make it alone?<br>  <br>  What can you do about it?<br>  <br>  * Realize that emotional abuse is a serious problem and you can get help.<br>  * Recognize that emotional abuse is as bad or worse than physical abuse.<br>  * Take your own safety and the safety of your children seriously.<br>  * Know that emotional abuse can lead to physical violence or death.<br>  * Know that you are not to blame for your partner's abusive behaviour.<br>  * Find people to talk to that can support you. Consider going for counselling.<br>  * Do not give up if community professionals are not helpful. Keep looking for<br>  * Someone that will listen to you and take emotional abuse seriously.<br>  * Recognize that you have the right to make your own decisions, in your own time, and that dealing with any form of abuse may take time.<br>  * Trust yourself and your own experiences. Believe in your own strengths. Remember that you are your own best source of knowledge and strength, and that you already have the tools you need to survive. <br>  <br>  Where can you turn to?<br>  <br>  * Women's help lines are for you too. Find the number in the front of your phone book.<br>  * Shelters do accept women who are emotionally abused and have not been physically abused. The help line can refer you to the one nearest you. Use the Bell Relay Service if they do not have a TTY. If you have a disability, ask where there is an accessible shelter in your area. <br>  * If you have been threatened with harm or death, or are being stalked (followed and harassed) by your partner or ex-partner, you can call the police. Dial 911, or if you are in a rural area, find out the emergency number.<br>  * If you are considering leaving, especially if you have children, see a lawyer. In Ontario you can call, 1-800-268-8326, for referrals to a lawyer and be entitled to a free half-hour visit.<br>  * Abused women are at the greatest risk of being harmed or killed when they leave. Ensure that you have a safety plan in place.|`|lzooHi0Baa	As long as there are volunteers to feed the ego of an abuser, there will women like you asking for the same advise.  You chose to live a miserable, abusive life and that is your choice and we respect it.   But no matter how you slice it, your husband should go to anger management counseling before it gets worse.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	Well it sounds like he is unhappy.  It sounds like you guys are young.  He may feel tied down.  Or he may not be doing well at school and he is worried.  Maybe he's unhappy cuz you are not too pretty.|`|oNqxzfLQaa	ive seen a similar situation before. although, of course we cant generalize. <br>  <br>  what may be happening is that he may feel as if he is superior to you now and he doesnt think that speaking with you is fulfilling. what may be happening is that being around more "learned" people is making him feel as you are not on his level mentally and that could explain the shortness. he may not want to come out and say it though. you should ask him. im guessing by this time, you should know when he is lying about  his answer so ask him directly and watch his reaction.<br>  <br>  <br>  if this is the case, you can find ways to prove to him that you are worth conversation. <br>  <br>  we all could use some self enrichment. although you have nothing to prove if he really loves you. but you can go to braincurls,com. buff up your knowledge and vocab. research his feild so you two have something to talk about. hope this helps some.<br>  <br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  . <br>  also, you said you werent very beautiful. that may be part of the problem. sometimes, people treat you according to the way they think you see yourself. <br>  <br>  you are beautiful sweetie, and as soon as you start believing that, the change will come. he may sense your lack of self esteem and may also be unattracted to that. <br>  <br>  let him know that you KNOW that you are the ish.lol<br>  <br>  and sometimes, it takes age old jealousy. you can handle that part.|`|dzGtjvf2aa	He is most likely cheating on you.|`|PvNJCzgmaa	well my husband acts the same way too sometimes. he works full time and goes to school. it might be stress. you should try to maybe make plans to go somewhere together alone and nice and maybe let the little things go. if you tell him hes rude hes going to get defensive and be mean to you. it might not be your fault but stress can make a person very mean.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I think sitting down with him and having a serious talk is the key here. You need to tell him how you are feeling. Ask him why he's been treating you like this lately. Don't hold back any feelings or expressions, he needs to understand this is truly hurting you. Let him talk and have his share as well, see what he has to say.<br>  <br>  After this talk if things don't start getting better then, he really needs a eye opener and a break. Hopefully it won't get that far though and things will go great after this talk. Good luck hon, I know this is hard.
AA11988503	He's bored. Or lonely. You still have your sense of individuality because you have a career and a life outside of him. He has nothing to call his own, which is why he's found a circle of friends and a new hobby. He's overdoing it a little because he's found a sense of individuality again and he's clinging to it because he doesn't want to lose it.<br>  <br>  Tell him you still love him and that you've missed spending time with him. Ask if there's anything he's wanted to do in life (a hobby, a trip, etc) that maybe you two could do together, either alone or with friends. Or tell him that you've noticed how important fishing is to him and ask if he'd maybe share that passion a little with you and teach you how to fish sometime. Don't take his new hobby or friends away from him or he may be resentful. But do see if there's something fun that you can do together.|`|W1q9hV2Naa	Ask can you go, if he says no, do some P I work.  He might just enjoy their company to yours, if so you need to do some damage control at home.  Make some dramatic changes to your social life - that ought to get his attention.  Good Luck and Take Care.|`|A5U4EgPJaa	I would say, try to spend time with your girls and pay less attention to him... let's see how he reacts to that!  It's called reverse psychology.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Start spending a   L O T   of money on yourself  that will perk up his ears and eyes !|`|5DJzp6bMaa	He is Old and has friends You said You have tried talking to him so If that did Nothing then Go get some Friends of Your own to spend time With or Take up Fishing and Join him and his new Buddies.|`|RtkB46peaa	Perhaps you need to plan something for you both to do together, rather than waiting around for him to do all the work.

Is that why she says she gave him head, then claims no sex happened?<br>  <br>  That's complete BS!  Oral sex is sex, and she cheated on you!  You need to decide if you can forgive her and trust her again, and if your marriage is worth saving.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide that, but with all this lying it doesn't sound hopeful.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	I really would ask twice about the whole situation. You either trust her or you do not. I mean it seems if I was a man and my wife said that I would not trust her anymore. I think she did it and is a liar and trying to fish for reasons why. Claiming you did not love her and that she is sorry. She is not sorry because if she was she would of never done anything. No matter if she thought you did not love her or not.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't understand your question.  You say both that your wife says she gave another guy head, and also that no sex happened.  These statements are completely contradictory because "head" = oral sex.  Please try re-writing your question.|`|HRIbmp67aa	well, while you're in the habit of listening to what others' have to say, why not check the magic 8 ball for it's advice?|`|mQhSxCpoaa	I would say that your wife is lying.<br>  She gave him oral sex, now they are both lying to you to cover up their lies and their butts.<br>  If she said that she did it, then you honestly have no reason to believe that she was lying and is now telling you the truth by saying that she did. <br>  Why would she apologize and says she's sorry for something she didn't do. <br>  It sounds like she is guilty, but covering whatever happened for him and herself.<br>  I am guessing that if she was down there, they might have had sex too. Get yourself checked honey. You never know what she could be giving you next.|`|23e0860d0b53493506c96a5edac4e09eaa	First, why is your wife even flirting with other men, let alone your friends to begin with?  Is she just that type of person?  That's just a dumb excuse for her saying that she didn't think you loved her.  She knows what she's doing.  She's wanting her cake and eat it too.  Don't be played by either one of them.  If there truly was something going on which there shouldn't have even happened in the first place, everything will all come out.  Just give it some time.  If she really did sleep with your friend, I wouldn't sleep with her because you don't know what she might possibly have now.  Hope it works out for you.|`|kDbsdmLbaa	If she has talked about it she has probably done it. No excuse not "even you don't love me"  is an excuse for cheating. Even if she says there was no sex, they probably was to. I would just tell her to go and be with the guy. If he was any friend to you he wouldn't have done this to begin with. Move on and be happy with your life or someone else.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	that's sad for you both. Sad for you that your wife is going outside the marriage in sexual matters. Sad for her that she feels so low about herself that she would even joke about that. You should sit her down and explain that if she's gonna give it to anyone it should be you, and ask her why she thought you didn't love her?|`|xhpAiWPvaa	She did it she just came clean to you might have joked about it but she told you|`|GcsUwIAaaa	sounds like someones knob gobblin
qrI5ZH42aa	There are a few issues that you've raised here that you'll need to talk to your husband about:<br>  <br>  1)You feel as though you can't handle the stress of caring for your FIL as well as your baby and work.  From what I understand, you'll only be working while your MIL isn't.  So could you come to an agreement with her that if she's at home she'll help you with household tasks and care for her husband while you work and care for your baby?  Then when she's working you won't have to so you can care for you FIL.  If I've misunderstoon and you'll have to work all the way thorugh/ your mother in law won't be working explain to your husband that you're willing to work as hard as you can but this is just too much.  He may come to an agreement with you himself (only cooking once a week and freezing meals to eat later, he'll do the housework when he gets back from work etc).<br>  <br>  2)You don't want to leave your baby with your MIL when you go on holiday.  Why is this?  Is it because you don't trust her or is it the common anxiety every parent gets when they leave their child for the first time?  You know you can trust her, she's raised her own children as well as worked as a babysitter.  And you know she'll pay a lot more attention to her grandchild!  He'll be in safe hands, and I'm sure you know it.  If you're anxious, talk to your husband.  Make arrangements to call home twice a day and have a mobile phone so you're always contactable.  It's something you'll just have to cope with unless you want to shorten your holiday length.<br>  <br>  3)Your MIL will be giving you advice.  Talk to your husband in advance and explain to him that you know what you're doing and you think you're doing a great job.  I'm sure he'll agree with you!  Tell him in advance that if your MIL gives you advice you don't want to follow, you'll tell her that you prefer your way.  Get a promise from your husband now that if an argument ensues he won't take his mother's side and tell you off.  Apart from this just listen politely to what she has to say, do think aboiut it before dismissing it, explain to her why you prefer your way and if she still tries to persuade you just calmly keep repeating your logical argument. Don't get flustered or wound up.  If you google "unwanted advice" the majority of results are about new mothers complaining about MILs, so you're not alone! Here's a brilliant link <a href="http://www.justmommies.com/articles/unwanted-advice.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.justmommies.com/articles/unwa...</a><br>  <br>  4)You think it's all about the money.  Are you sure about this?  Indian men are proper mummy's boys.  How long has it been since he's seen them?  Have they ever met their grandchild?  I'm sure there are other underlying reasons to the visit.  If it IS purely monetary then explain to your husband that it would be less of a disruption to keep his elderly parents in their home and send them a bit of your excess money every week and hire a babysitter for ten days.<br>  <br>  5)You're already tense. You feel like there's going to be a lot of work and arguing coming your way, and maybe there is.  But think how much this will mean to your husband and inlaws.  You're being an excellent family member and sometimes that requires sacrifice as long as it won't send you over the edge.<br>  <br>  6)You're scared of talking to your husband.  Why?  As long as you don't say anything disrespectful about his parents he will listen to you.  You're his wife and he'll work hard for the happiness of you and your son!  Don't say "your mother will give me a lot of useless advice" try "I'm happy with the way I'm raising our kid, I'm going to stick with it until I'm convinced there's a better way".  Work together as a team on this and it may well end up being very useful to you having help with your son.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long, if you need more help my email's open.|`|dD5uhH8naa	you should tell him exactly how you feel and see if you guys can work something out
AA10065812	You need to notify child support enforcement to discontinue the claim.  If you two are back together because of the economy, I hope it's in separate bedrooms.  Just getting back together, and sleeping together, does not fully resolve the issues that caused the divorce.  You should be dating, chaperoned by your kids, or someone else.  No touchy feely, or "Let's just do it for now".  You need to take it slow and rekindle what there was that brought you together in the first place, than get remarried, not just living together.

Why don't you get separate accounts? That way you'd be sure to get the correct amount.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if the court has ordered him to pay it then yes.<br>  <br>  if you are together because you're going to remarry each other then once you've remarried you will petition the court to withdraw the child support order.|`|htWw0OlCaa	If you have a court order for him to pay, then yes, but if the court finds out that he lives with you and money is going into a joint account, then he can take you to court to get the payments stopped or modified. Child support is for what absent parents are suppose to pay, but your case sounds like you two are together, and in that case your child support should be stopped since it seems like he is helping to take care of the child/children.....|`|Wv592rOqaa	Yes, if you have an court order against him to pay child support.  You would have to go and stop the action because if you have a joint bank account and he owes back child support they can put a lien on the account.  However, if he is giving you money willing and and you see no need to have a court order him to pay - he does not and should not have to give you additional money just for the children.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you have a working joint account to pay bills and keep your own account as well.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	That doesnt sound very "ex" to me. Does he still sleep in your bed too?<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	If it's court ordered yes. If you are choosing for him not to pay child support anymore you are going to have to go to the department of family services to the child support division and drop your case for sure. Otherwise, if he doesn't make the monthly payments then it is going to get him behind. <br>  The state/federal gov't isn't going to know that he lives with you without you telling them.|`|3glmptC7aa	Then why is he your ex? Would that not make him your man now? <br>  If your child support is under a court order then yes he would have to pay unless you both went to the child support agency in your area and say you and him are together but that means you can't just get it put back into the system if you have a break up or split account thing going on and want child support again. That would take some time to get all that put back in the system! I am still waiting on child support for my son its a whole whopping 102. a month which I am glad is ordered but have in six months only seen 112.00 I am fighting just to get paid!|`|4cbcdee11cb3c61a098a2a21a3d1b3b7aa	Yes, however you can get the courts to revise the order as long as the children live in the same house.<br>  <br>  p.s. What difference does it make? The money taken from him by DCFS and then mailed to you. So it's still in the house.|`|ed3479cd30aa26d0499c9236b905e198aa	As long as you remain divorced, he still has to follow the court order to pay child support.<br>  Since your living together and sharing your money at this time it should be no big financial deal-money comes right back into the house.|`|W1q9hV2Naa	I would say yes until the courts give an order for stop payment.  If not if he moves out in 6 months, you can always go back and hit him up for back child support.|`|59b1fddc617491e538d31b5a8aa3904aaa	Yes , if there is a court order .<br>  You must petition the court for review .|`|wXyoo8mNaa	No idea but that's 1 strange relationship u have.|`|bURy6VFaaa	YES, I THINK WHAT YES|`|Iptnp2zCaa	Let me get this straight.  Your EX still lives with you and you still have a joint checking account?  So if it's joint, you have full access to his money and vice versa?  What's the point of child support if you have that kind of living arrangement?  He would pay you child support and you would turn right around and put it in your joint checking account?  You'd be giving it right back to him??|`|a467db7e2a60319577424440ca3b3d25aa	yep. but there are ways you can go to court and tell the judge that he has been supporting the family. That way everything will be on the up and up. Just so that you won't have to worry later.  I did this went to court and just said he lives with me. AND he pays bills, buys food, clothes etc.  Best for him if he has the paperwork. That way it is on record that he really is supporting the family.  because you are not married....|`|KwdtzmKhaa	Have you filed for child support? that's the only way he HAS to pay it. If you have filed, then yes, he still has to pay. the only way he doesn't is if you get married again, or you file again and have it taken off.|`|GegQJNzSaa	Yes he does,unless you both go to court and tell of new circumstances,and then they may still force it. But why worry if its going right back to the family anyways|`|YDRRDwiBaa	No if you guys live together his technical still a guardian of the children|`|fg7rE9OHaa	Yes - if that is  in your agreed upon divorce settlement.|`|JSFCkne8aa	He has to pay support until the court says otherwise|`|AKPaQCsCaa	Are you both still paying into the bank account?|`|dD5uhH8naa	i dont think so because the child is still with both of you|`|vuRejUo3aa	Already got 5 answers.

He doesn't get to dictate what would make this process easier for him, or when you'll be at peace enough with the situation to establish a "cordial friendship," if ever.  Trust your instincts and do what's best for you and your child.|`|5hxWSezPaa	In my opinion he is trying to befriend you so that you are easier to work with when it comes to settling the financial issues in your upcoming divorce.  He knows he has cheated and he wants to be able to portray your relationship now as one where you still consider him a friend.  Don't let him use you in that way.|`|veZLfnGFaa	You don't have to be friends with anyone you don't want to be.  And you certainly don't need him as a friend.  Of course, you are joined at the hip to him for life since you have a child together.  But that doesn't mean you have to chat with him every week.  Get your divorce and move on.  :)|`|w87jwOaOaa	Your relationship only needs to go as far as communication with him regarding the child.  Break all other ties.  Besides when he has a new woman or you have a new man, it would be hard for them.|`|3glmptC7aa	Time is the best advice I can give you! You have to do what is right for your child. It sucks I personally can say that! I was in a similar situation We were friends for almost 5 years before we got married then married and a year later were separated and now are on much better terms my son was 2 at the time we didn't talk for a long time I could not get over him cheating on me either!  My son is now 7 and his father and I can do a lot of things together for our sons sake! But on the brighter side I am getting remarried so things can get better follow your heart and your gut instincts your not only a mother but a person who needs to be true to herself too! I wish you the best of luck !|`|wia9SXCPaa	If you really want to save your marriage you need to keep the lines of communication open.<br>  <br>  Before you can be husband and wife you need to be friends.  <br>  <br>  If you can forgive him for his infidelity and you Truly want to make this marriage work you need to take the steps to accomplish it.  Talking and being friends is at the heart of those steps. Get a good marriage counselor.  Try to make it work for your child.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Me and my husband are divorced we have three children together, were not friends but we do keep it cordial with eachother because we do have kids. If your husband wants to be friends just to "chat" thats not really fair to you because your still mourn'n your seperation from him, he probably feels a lot of guilt as well, thats why he wants to be friends so he doesnt feel like crap so much for hurting you..<br>  <br>  Godd Luck!|`|GegQJNzSaa	I was married for 20 years. There was a million reasons we were divorced. Some feelings were hurt. For the first year after the divorce we did our best to avoid contact except for dropping off our 14 yr old. But after a year when things cooled off we started doing favors. Like he is bad at banking,so I taught him how to write a check. I would often pay is bills for him. He would work on my car or things like that. This has been going on for 3 and a half years. We both bought Harleys and often go on trips together. We get along great. Yes we do sleep together. But we both know we could never get back together full-time. We know each other to well and we're not our type lol. We are best of friends and everyone involved is better for it!|`|lhsg6l07aa	first of all, if he cheated on you i will not say that u do not need to be with him because it is not true when they say "once a cheater is always a cheater". if he truly regrets what he has done and you both want to save the marriage, then do so. but if you really think that it wont work out, you need to stop all comunication with him unless it is about your child. it will def. make it harder for you to move towards a divorce if you are "friendly" with him. i would say, if you think it can be done, try and save the marriage because u have a small child together|`|lzooHi0Baa	Keep a safe distance until the divorce is final.  With friends like your husband, who needs enemies.   He can take his friendship to his mistress not to you, it would be like giving you leftover so you won't go hungry.   You do not need friendship, you must have many friends, what you needed and wanted was a loyal, caring husband and he failed that test.   You will need to have open communication after the divorce when it comes to your child's issues, nothing else.   Don't steep that low, after being his wife, become his confident.    This is my highest recommendation considering the fact that you still have feelings for him and are wishing to save the marriage.   This fact puts you in a very vulnerable position whereby you can be manipulated and used very easily.
5DJzp6bMaa	Polygamy|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I think this is how society falls deeper and deeper into immorality and eventual starts to excepts things that we normally would not except. Basically, your solution is to lower our standard so it doesn't seem "wrong".|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	My problem with your "question" is your underlying implication that polygamy would reduce or eliminate divorce and adultery.  How ludicrous!  People would still cheat and divorce no matter how many spouses they had.<br>  <br>  I also have a problem with Islam's sexist stance that a man can have more than one wife, but a woman can't have more than one husband.  Do you think that allowing women to have multiple husbands would also eliminate divorce and adultery?|`|AA10065812	*** A few years ago there was a conference here of Social Historians.  One of the discussions on the agenda was the decreasing number of male child births and the implications this will have on marriages and the general workforce.  As the number of breathing males decrease, pluralistic relationships may become necessary.<br>  <br>  As for divorces, 85% involve couples who were living together, and/or married prior to age 24.  Wait until than to drop your shorts or panties and you will find a lifetime partner.|`|5sMZrmqjaa	Average life span of females is more than that of males<br>  <br>  <br>  By nature males and females are born in approximately the same ratio. A female child has more immunity than a male child. A female child can fight the germs and diseases better than the male child. For this reason, during the pediatric age itself there are more deaths among males as compared to the females. <br>  <br>  During wars, there are more men killed as compared to women. More men die due to accidents and diseases than women. The average life span of females is more than that of males, and at any given time one finds more widows in the world than widowers.<br>   World female population is more than male population <br>  <br>  In the USA, women outnumber men by 7.8 million. New York alone has one million more females as compared to the number of males, and of the male population of New York one-third are gays i.e sodomites. The U.S.A as a whole has more than twenty-five million gays. This means that these people do not wish to marry women. Great Britain has four million more females as compared to males. Germany has five million more females as compared to males. Russia has nine million more females than males. God alone knows how many million more females there are in the whole world as compared to males.<br>  <br>  <br>  8.   Restricting each and every man to have only one wife is not practical<br>  <br>  <br>  Even if every man got married to one woman, there would still be more than thirty million females in U.S.A who would not be able to get husbands (considering that America has twenty five million gays). There would be more than four million females in Great Britain, 5 million females in Germany and nine million females in Russia alone who would not be able to find a husband.<br>  <br>  Suppose my sister happens to be one of the unmarried women living in USA, or suppose your sister happens to be one of the unmarried women in USA. The only two options remaining for her are that she either marries a man who already has a wife or becomes public property. There is no other option. All those who are modest will opt for the first. <br>  <br>  In Western society, it is common for a man to have mistresses and/or multiple extra-marital affairs, in which case, the woman leads a disgraceful, unprotected life. The same society, however, cannot accept a man having more than one wife, in which women retain their honourable, dignified position in society and lead a protected life. <br>  <br>  Thus the only two options before a woman who cannot find a husband is to marry a married man or to become public property. Islam prefers giving women the honourable position by permitting the first option and disallowing the second.<br>  <br>  There are several other reasons, why Islam has permitted limited polygyny, but it is mainly to protect the modesty of women.|`|asxqampCaa	If those are the only three choices you can think of, and you are advocating the one where men get all the sex - then the BEST answer is -<br>  <br>  cut off your balls so you cannot infect the rest of the world, Einstein.<br>  <br>  And you have the nerve to advocate Islam? You mean the Islam that says women can't be educated? The Islam that says women can't drive because they are equal to cattle? The Islam that says women can't show their noses or ankles in public for fear it will excite some man and he will rape her and then we will have to stone *her* to death, not him? The Islam that shoots women in the back of the head with a Russian rifle as halftime entertainment at soccer matches? <br>  <br>  THAT Islam?

Rather, they are likely to ridicule what you are saying although they probably know on the inside that you're right but too proud to admit it. It's obvious what the answer is, and based on the situation with our society's insane divorce and cheating, we can definitely see the wisdom in polygamy. Just thank Allaah that we have this benefit and we have things easier on ourselves in that regard.

As soon as a woman is allowed to be educated, work, and own property, she walks away from this abusive lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Polygamous families in free democratic countries are very unstable. Even Brigham Young, early LDS polygamist, had 10 divorces.<br>  <br>  Our whole country and our economy is based on a strong nuclear family with 2 adults who love each other exclusively and pledge to care for each other. It allows both to flourish and contribute to the community.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it takes people a while to settle down with the right partner. That doesn't mean it isn't the right goal.<br>  <br>  Do you really think the government should go around enforcing contracts between spouses to treat each well? Will they put cameras in our bedrooms to be sure we sleep on schedule with the right spouse? Creepy.|`|yOHCXiaMaa	First of all lets get the bible straight.  Polygamy was practiced to keep women within a certain religion and/or tribe.  Second it was used to keep women from marrying men outside their religion so the children would continue to be raised in that religion.<br>  <br>  Second I see nothing about women having more than one husband.  I mean fair is fair.<br>  <br>  No polygamy would not stop divorces or cheating.  And no woman in her right mind would allow her husband to gain another wife.  Heck most men can't support the one they got with 2.5 kids and 1.5 dogs. I also know men are so selfish they wouldn't want to share their wife with another man and end up with Tuesdays and Thursdays.  So lets not try to hopefully gain acceptance on a thin strand like this.  Divorces are meant to separate two individuals at such a point that they are not willing to put up with each other.  And as far as divorces being down...sure cause more and more are just staying married and living with others...or killing and hiding the bodies.  This is just a way to commit adultry and get away with it.  HA!  Guess what God still knows.
sr7jX2wYaa	Yes  you should call them, maybe  they don't call you because  they aren't  sure you want to hang out now that your Main  friend is no longer around.  Just give them a call & see how it goes, & if  they want to do something, & see how they react.

b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	All women are naturally great lovers, if you notice women love to grow things and love is there favorite thing to grow. However a woman can not grow love unless the love she sends into a mans heart is focused and returned to her so she can grow it some more, this love energy is the circle surrounding the Yin Yang symbol and can take the couple to beautiful, spiritual heights but as most people have been taught to be very unnatural we must be willing to let go of what we have been taught. In Tantra we use sexual energy, Kundalini, "the energy of passion" to burn through years and life times of conditioning, we see that what is called Kundalini is loves vehicle and that all things are Kundalini, "the energy of passion" appearing as the physical universe as well as ourselves. I could say much more on the subject but the experience of life, love is the most important. <br>  <br>  "No matter how much a woman loves her man and wants to give her love to him, she will not and cannot give up all her divine energies if he is not yet himself, fully integrated or aligned with love. As very few men are themselves, the gap of unhappiness between man and woman keeps on growing.<br>  <br>  To be a fully integrated male, a man has to assimilate in his body the divine female energies that woman can only release to him through right physical lovemaking. But the man has to be man enough. He has to be able to love her enough; that is, love her selflessly during the actual act of lovemaking. He has to be able to absorb and express sufficient love in his body to reach the highest part of her, and love enough to extract the divine energies from her deepest centre. To be able to love in this way is the authority man has lost - his only true authority over woman." (Barry Long)|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	For me, it is one who is open to discussion (about what they like, want, and fantasize about), confidence in themselves, and even a little aggresiveness, and great oral skills.  Experience also helps alot.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	With women it's their passion.  If they are truly in love with their partner they put a whole lot more emotion into it and that makes all the difference.|`|Gb8cl8n2aa	being true to them..and loving and caring 4 them dearly..|`|zrz4bcalaa	Hi,<br>   <br>  I feel that it is the freedom that a man and a woman share together.  The freedom to be honest, open and for both to be connected at an emotional and physical level and BOTH to participate fully.  To me, this means trust  communication, and openness.  Genuine love is the final ingredient that takes the lover experience to the highest level.<br>  <br>  Of course, it is often the case that only one person has the same feelings, and a one sided relationship usually means that it is not a complete fulfilling experience for either party.<br>  <br>  True passion arises out of both man and woman sharing each other on multiple levels with genuine love and acceptance of one's self and the other.  IMHO
BYQ2kHPjaa	To be honest if he is harrassing you and threatening you, then that isn't really the actions of someone who loves you or cares about you. The fact that he dumped you on valentine's day shows that he doesn't care so I would not get back together with him. It sounds as if he got jealous when you hung out with your guy friend. I would try and be friends with him, buy only if he stopped threatening me. If he carries on then just ignore him. I would forget about him, and find someone who realli appreciates you and cares about you. Good luck xx|`|HPSApjGOaa	He sounds like a nut.<br>  You seem to have chosen a loser, and you built him up to the point where he thought he was all of that.<br>  The end result was, that he thought he did not need you anymore, and that he could have anyone he wanted.<br>  He wants you back now because he found out that he is not as hot as he thought he was.<br>  I would let my family, friends, and the police know what is going on.<br>  My family and friends would also pay him a visit. LOL<br>  Bottom line, watch your back. <br>  Buy a 3,000 volt taiser and always carry a cell phone. Program it to speed dial.<br>  Never show this creep fear. If you do, he will make it worse.<br>  I am speaking from experience.

How far will he take it? Just end it!|`|lrjCsFGpaa	1)Well,maybe..if he's really sweet.But to dump a girl on V-day?Not cool.<br>  2)I would be friends just so I can come back to the point where I love that person again and just so that person would stop harassing me and threatening.<br>  3)Um..maybe.If he was with someone else,I would just go be with my other friends.But it may not be okay because the threatening and harassing may get worse.|`|FIuUsrAMaa	1_no<br>  2-no<br>  3- yes(dont be afraid of him,those who threat ,usually do nothing,if really worried ..call the police)|`|jsgKGtdBaa	1)<br>  2) <br>  3)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  wut?

Is there a happy medium you both can agree upon?<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Your fiance sounds like he is about 10 years old.<br>  Since you purchased the boat before getting married, it is 100% yours. It was your fiance's choice to fix it up. Tell him if he wants to un-do what he did to fix it, fine but he'd better have it back to you in the same condition it was in when you got it. He likely threw the (old) parts away and since he stripped and painted it, it'll probably be impossible. Then tell him the boat will be in storage until you can afford to fix it, with or without him. <br>  I don't think the big problem is the boat. I think the BIG problem is your husband's immaturity. He's obviously insecure or he wouldn't tell you you're stupid. Personally, he sounds like a bigger pain in the azz than he's worth. Good luck and try not to let the rude answers bother you so much. There are a lot of rude people with nothing better to do than hide behind their computers and insult people.|`|AA10248966	Take a picture of the boat immediately, in fact, several really good ones. Get affidavits from people ab pout how the boa rt looks on the date they see it. Have it stored and do not tell him where it is being stored. You TELE this loser control fr eek who happens to be abusive, menacing, as well as compulsive and irresponsible. He;d make a OPUS husband, terrible;e dad, and he would get You into serious debts.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are totally right but hide the Benoit and stop seeing him. Speak to an attorney now about this for 15 minutes and also, make sure you do not repay him unless a court hearse the case. don;t even disuses it with him. Tell it Ono to the judge someway., and end the relationship,. Jon judge Will allow him to strip the paint off. No judge wil;l allow you to get the improvements without paying for it. also. So it is somewhere in between. The thing is he is a terrible human being who you must break up with, but FIRS, store that boar t somewhere without his knowing where,. and make sure it is kept Secret.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Your fiancé is not some one that you should merry he sounds like a trouble maker. He only seem interested in the boat and nothing else and that could be a sign of much pain and suffering that will come to your relationship. Tell him that you want to put off the marriage For a wail.  Tell him that you think that we are not meant to be together and see what he say. Remember that in a relationship everything should be equal .If it is not as one meaning both united together then the relationship will not last and there will be much pain and suffering. So ask your self ,is this what your ready to go thru if your marriage with him.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	If he insulted you, leave him.  My husband has never talked to me like that and never will, because he doesn't want me to leave him!!  And you respect the people you truly love.  He doesn't respect you.  Sell the boat and get your baby somewhere where he or she will respect their mother because they won't have to constantly watch their mother being disrespected.  You're trying to do the right thing and be responsible and he's being a child.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Greg is not going to be happy, but it's NOT HIS boat.  If he tries to dismantle it or strip the paint, you can call the police for willful destruction of property.<br>  <br>  Also, the tax return is NOT HIS.  You can do with it whatever you want.  You can put it into savings or blow it all on expensive shoes, or you can take yourself on vacation.  He has NO LEGAL RIGHT to tell you what to do with YOUR money.<br>  <br>  You have to put your foot down and just tell him:  <br>  <br>  "Honey, I am not going to put any more money into my boat until I am more financially secure.  That is final.  It's MY decision.  I'm not going to talk about it anymore."<br>  <br>  And if he tries to argue, just tell him: "I'm not changing my mind, and I'm not talking about it anymore."<br>  <br>  Seriously, YOU are the adult in this relationship.  Don't let him whine or make threats to get his way.|`|usrEJiZSaa	sell the boat , dump the jerk , get a job and get on with your life. stop being manipulated by the arrogant con man|`|zMg4hQwDaa	leave this jerk there is no other way to avoid a control freak they never change.

AND WAiT UNTiL YOU GET A JOB TO SPEND A LiL MONEY ON THE BOAT!!!|`|lXR2jjDDaa	I wouldn't really want to say that you or him is right because that might just make more arguments. Seems to me that your fiance should learn be communicate nicer and not put you down. Its normal to argue but giving in to make him not yell anymore and scaring the child is not the right way to go. Think about how it will effect your child when he or she is older. In my opinion you need to set it straight to your fiance and tell him he needs to set his priorities right and tame his temper. Money is a big concern in our economy and right now it should go to taking care of the family and not a boat. Its not good for any of you to do all this fighting on a daily basis. I'm sorry to hear your situation. I hope you figure it out
9xCtDDBgaa	I have a few black female friends who tell me the same thing.<br>  My friend Kayla asked this guy "Why don't you just approach me? You've been staring!" and he told her that most black women only date black men.<br>  <br>  WTF right?<br>  <br>  So then she told him the truth, which is that race isn't important.<br>  And he said "Well black girls are just loud and so you're not sure if you wanna get into that."<br>  <br>  People are just ignorant idiots.|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	It would probably depend on how familiar and experienced the white guy was with black women.  It can be intimidating if you don't know much about your racial heritage and cultural background.  White women are hard enough to figure out for many guys, so try to imagine trying to get the feel for a black woman.  <br>  <br>  I have been trying to experience a black woman for years, but have not found any I was interested in or attracted to.  Have met a few thay wanted to just do me, but I did not feel anything towards them, either physically or emotionally.  Any tips from a black woman's perspective to us white guys who are interested in being with a black woman?|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Well some white men are like that its because they don't either want people talking about y'all or they don't want there family to look at him in a bad way I went through the same thing.|`|gEd1jlOEaa	Some white guys are shy!

Good one though!|`|V6XVLbaGaa	another example of a man who should not talk during intimacy.|`|65ojSBXgaa	Well you can’t really play like that with women.  In this case you know your wife better, so if you knew she didn’t have a sense of humor then you shouldn’t have said that.

My husband holds me all night and then says another woman's name :(|`|bT713RWqaa	haha i guess it depends on how you said it LOL she is probably too insecure to find any humour in a comment like that.<br>  <br>  or maybe she is PMSing!!!!!!|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I don't know....If my husband said that I would've laughed!|`|oGo4ftFMaa	Lol!

Why can't they just come up to us and say I like you or whatever they say? Because I was right last week when I said that girls are way smarter than guys.<br>  <br>  And when they get into fights right in front of you just for attention? That annoys me too. But it is kinda cute that they do it just for you. And if you've got a guy playing those types of games with you, then watch out, you may just have a secret admirer!|`|lx3orRJDaa	Yeah, they pretty much do and sometimes it ends up badly. they send out mixed signals and you think they don't like you and then you chicken out. but most of the time, they use it to get your attention.|`|nkc7a39baa	Absolutely not! We are a very evolved species, who do not have time for games! He is merely networking.|`|HFn8M2KDaa	oh yeah hella silly games! my ex is doing that to me right now..but just ignore it, all he wants you to do & run to him so he can get your attention..it's all jealousy trust me^.^|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	funny..... that kinda sounda like a chick..??

Why does she  report  to some  guy? I do not understand what that means. I would let her know you are  not interested in the guy  she  reports to  so when  she likes to talk he gets the message*|`|D8EMsZT1aa	call me n il tell u 207-523-0879|`|ML4oQ8tuaa	you never know about people but I wouldn't dig any deeper into the situation than you already are. just lay low and maybe the truth will end up revealing itself, whether it be that she really does have a crush on this guy or if she was just testing your feelings about him. <br>  time will only tell<br>  Good Luck

They said my baby had spinabifida. I went the next morning and after extensive testing, they found that my baby had Gastroschisus. His intestine were floating on the outside of his body. I went to the hospital for 3 days a week from then on out. They wanted me to have an abortion because they didn't know how bad it would be. Plus, his intestine had kinked like a hose, he couldn't pass anything through his little body. Doc said that his intestine could explode while in my belly and i could die too. I said NO. Whatever GOD had planned for me, i will deal with. <br>  <br>  They induced labor when i was 32 weeks. I had a beautiful baby boy that was 4lb 2oz. Very good size for his age. He spent 2 months in Children's Hosp of PGH. He had 3 surgeries total. If you seen him now, you would never know.... Except he has no belly button...

Gb8cl8n2aa	ask her how would have she felt if you would have done the same thing with her..tell her she is like a professional slut..and dump your bf..|`|1sRqj5fhaa	slam the door in her face and  tell her that she is a whore and ask her one questions what possessed her to do that? and break up with your boyfriend make him feel like crap|`|2quTUoA6aa	Calm down, he's probably not worth getting this upset about. Hear what your friend has to say, it may not be her fault. Make your decisions after you've gotten all the facts and have had a chance to calm down.|`|jTHSi304aa	I would tell her how she made you feel and take a little break from your friendship so you can really think things over.Is this guy really worth losing your friendship over?Do you love him?If you love him and are serious with him I wouldn't have anything to do with either of them.Your friend's are soppossed to be there for you and support you no matter what.They don't kiss your boyfriend!She knew you liked him and she did it anyways.He's not innocent either.If he really liked you he wouldn't of kissed her.If you continue to have these people in your life it will be drama!I doubt you want that so be the better person and go get another friend and boyfriend!I wish you good luck!|`|UVnr7wrmaa	You need to explain to your friend exactly how much she's hurt you. Explain to her how much you liked your bf, explain to her how much you trusted her and thought of her as a best friend, until she used you... explain to her that you don't know if you can ever trust her again. Explain to her that a true friend wouldn't go out and kiss another friends boyfriend. <br>  <br>  And let her talk to you, too. She obviously wants to make amends, but kissing your boyfriend was wrong, and you need to make her realize that. If you're still angry at her then tell her you need some space to think things over. Tell her that after her betrayal of your trust, your decision will need time.<br>  <br>  You were right do dump your boyfriend. He had no excuse for doing that to you. But now you need to make up another decision of your own. Will you or will you not forgive her?|`|hIzQyflqaa	wow, what a *****, shes obviously not a real friend, tell her where to go!|`|cb104d1bcc77d1529695dba02921e82aaa	First, lash out your anger at her, but don't use insulting name-calling or anything. Tell her exactly how much she hurt you. Talk for as long as you need. If you finish, and she is still there listening to you, carefully think about how your life would be if you didn't have your best friend by your side. How much is she worth in your heart? Think if you are willing to give her a second chance. If not, break it up with her.

If anything, you get the last laugh.<br>  <br>  You can't change your wife's past, and it might not be a good idea to do so even if it were possible; if she hadn't gone through certain experiences and made certain mistakes, she might never have grown into the person you fell in love with.

My wife and I have each had several partners before meeting each other. I am very grateful that neither one of us was a virgin when we met. That probably would have ruined our relationship.

She probably feels like you made your decision based on not wanting to spend time with her. Invite her to do something either free or cheaper.

vo7Ws7xtaa	I agree with everyone here... I think between month 3-5 the initial excitement of the relationship wears off, and this is where you start to really get to know the other person and if you mesh as a couple.  Sex and romance are so easy at the start, you just constantly have that desire to do those things, but it gets a little tiring after a few months and you start to get back to your normal life.  Once things settle at this point it gets comfortable.  I'm in a 10 mth strong relationship now, and things did get rocky around 5 months, but we've weathered our changes and things are great now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|aBPNeRA9aa	Oh, totally!

I think it is because the new effact wears off, and you are learning more about the person.<br>  <br>  Just remeber to be truthfull with your parnter, and let them know if anything is wrong so they can try to fix it. <br>  <br>  Once you get through it, your relationship and bond is much stronger, and the road is essentially much smoother like the others said, hope this helped, good luck|`|Zx6el3mpaa	yeah it does,<br>  thats when it was hardest for me<br>  when i started to doubt my relationship. <br>  but its been almost a year now and everythings<br>  amazing.|`|ey7ekTpTaa	My relationship that I've been in for 10months was the worst ever around the third month.<br>  But now we're both happy because we sailed through it together.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	yes , best to keep the fire going , by getting her roses , candy , going out and having  fun .

I've only been with 1 person for a long time so I'll give you my best description. If you care about the person a lot then then the spiritual and emotional part will come. You will feel like your sharing a part of yourself that no one else can have and that you are being givin something that is meant just for you. Physically, it is great when you do it right and make it last. When all the components are together you just feel really connected to someone else, very passionate, and very loving. I don't know how to describe it anymore than that, but since you will be new at this, the 3rd to fifth time will probably be when you get to feeling the ecstasy of it all.|`|46602029a995276efc45f34a38b46e0caa	You cannot see your screen, and maybe your character can be killed.|`|c5b488ff1d027aa50957b02bc976c5bcaa	It's like a combination of a deep-tissue massage and a really long sneeze (in your pants).|`|vXgDg83paa	It hurts.

You said he was a decently friendly boy, so you must quite like him, but I understand why you would find him so annoying. I think that you should tell him when you're both in good moods that you don't like him making comments about your dad being fat and your brother being pale, and your dog. Also, you should make it clear that it really pisses youoff when he calls you fat. Maybe he was just trying to be friendly when he called you to the smoothie place, but it seems quite strange how he always insists on having you there...maybe you should ask him calmly, "I have other things to do, why don't you ask someone else", but in a nice way.<br>  My advice is to talk to him, and find out why he's so pissed off at you now, but if he carries on turning people against you, you should forget about him.|`|D8EMsZT1aa	have him call me, or u? 207-523-0879
BaNrweQ4aa	just remember your friends are your friends because of you, and they like you just the way you are :) by being you, you are showing how much you like them. by listening; you are showing them respect and letting them know you can be trusted. some people just are open; and some people are more quiet about things - but never be shy/embarrassed to speak to your closest friends because that's what they are there for :) they want to help you/listen to you - or they aren't friends really are they lol telling them the smallest things that are happening in your life is a good start, and just work your way into telling them big things. another idea; if your friend tells you a boy she likes - just carry on the conversation and say something like "yeah i kinda like someone too" and your friend will be interested and glad you are sharing things with her :) friendships are based around trust. never be jealous of your friends, just join in as much as possible - because you are probably really similar to them. you just have to find your similarities :) talk about what music you like; that one isn't hard as you aren't sharing secrets - you are sharing basic interests with them :) get talking as much as possible :D|`|09zVUMBRaa	Drop me an email if you figure this out.

I can't seem to tell anyone anything :(<br>  I always observe my surroundings and keep to myself a lot, but i'm trying to be more social... <br>  At least people like to open up to you about their problems...I don't even have that ability. I'm like 2 people, it's terrible, one at school and one at home.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I don't think i'm the right position to give you advice, but you could try to trust them more and slowly open up to one of them, your best one probably. Maybe you have the preconceived notion that it'd be weird, but it's completely normal to talk about your life. Take it slow and steady...remember it's not good to bottle your emotions. All the best :)
qrI5ZH42aa	An arranged marriage is, simply, a marriage arranged by older relatives (usually your parents).  There may or may not be money changing over from one family to another. Sometimes there's a 'dowry' which is money and valuable things the wife will bring to her new home (to share with her husband) or a 'bride price' which is money the groom's family give to the bride's family to compensate for the fact that they're losing a working family member.  Sometimes neither are present.  It's just a way of parents to make sure their children marry somebody of the same culture/religion/economic background/education level.  <br>  <br>  Please please please don't get confused between arranged marriages, where both parties can refuse the marriage if they want to, with forced marriages ("marry him or I'll kill you!") as many western people do not at all seem to see the difference.  <br>  <br>  A love marriage is where people met and fell in love before getting married.  It won't happen often in cultures that practice arranged marriages as people waiting for an arranged marriage aren't allowed to date (so won't fall in love).|`|NX4LYXkqaa	known devil is better than the other|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	In a love marriage, you develop deep feelings before you marry.

YuVSDBkzaa	My mom did this with my older sister. I think she was 16 at the time. Since she didn't know how to use a computer at all, she had my sister check the history on my dad's work computer and sure enough, he was signed up for many sex web sites. Personally, I don't think a parent should be involving their child in something like this, the parent should handle it on their own or with someone qualified, like a counselor. If you don't want to tell your mom, I wouldn't blame you. It puts you in an awkward position and it's not your responsibility. But if you do feel the need to let her know, just tell her you were using his computer and some things popped up on the history when you were doing a little searching. I wouldn't go into details about what you saw, just tell her you think it's best she check it out for herself.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	All men watch porn, honey.

That's probably why she told you to check the history.  She wanted you to know about his nasty habit.  She can't stand that you think highly of him when she knows he's been putting her through this all these years.  She shouldn't have done this, as this is not your place.  Try to understand that while this is a hurtful revelation, your dad is human and makes mistakes like everyone.  Sometimes we think our parents are perfect but we realize that they have faults or issues that were never resolved even in their old age.  Forgive him and pray for your parents relationship.  You don't have to take on his habits, you don't have to please your mom, and you don't have to take this weight around with you.  Drop it, and enjoy your life.  Be the most healthy person you can be and form good habits.  It will help you in your own marraige someday.  God bless.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Your mom is wrong to involve you in her relationship. It's not your business nor your place to be in that position. If your mother asks you to do something, she should be able to ask you in front of your father.

Tell her she needs to look on his computer herself.|`|Iod5edCSaa	Its none of your business. Your mother should never bring you into this issue.

But, you have been together for 5 years...has this person ever been with out work?  If he is a go getter then what can be wrong...economy is bad yes, but it will turn around in a year or two.   I can't believe that you are planning a wedding in 2 months?  Most people it takes a year???  If you were getting married in that amount of time then you should just go to Justice of the peace.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	If you really loved him, I don't think you would be asking such a question.

He should find someone that loves him the same way and not because of his finances. The way that the economy is, right now it takes two incomes to make it.

If you really love him then stick it out, remember if you really want to marry him it will be in "sickness and health, for richer or poorer" in good times and bad, so this is definitely a test of your relationship then. If you really care about him then you will stay but if you feel you deserve better and can get it, then you need to make up your mind for yourself whether you should marry him or not.

When you realize that Mexico's a sh*thole and the almost all white Roman Empire was better off 2000 years ago... and the USA is 100 times better than mexico... and you cant even drink the water in mexico without getting sick, or be a foreigner in mexico without getting raped or jumped or stabbed...... YOU WILL REALIZE MEXICO SUCKS!  Everything mexico stands for sucks! Mexican PEOPLE suck! Their CULTURE sucks! sorry to tell you- but it's true! DONT DUMB YOURSELF DOWN TO AN INFERIOR CULTURE.<br>  <br>  4) All the mexican guys I know are man-wh*res who simply want to get laid and take advantage of girls. FORTUNATELY FOR THEM, most hispanic girls are the same way, and are equally ready to "give it to Papi".  <br>  <br>  5) So, if you want to impress your Mexican men, simply dress sl*tty like the mexican girls do, make out with them, grab their d*ck, suck their d*ck at their house, or whatever other slutty, immoral acts that you can think of.  They will love you for it.<br>  <br>  But not really "love"- they'll just be using you and enjoying you like a sextoy.  But if that's the kind of guys you want... BE MY GUEST! ...But you're making one of the biggest mistakes of your life.<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I have to throw one more thing in there:<br>  <br>  6) I'm a wrestler, as you can probably tell.  Mexicans may be "bad", but not in the sense that they're tough, rebellious, or good at fighting.  <br>  <br>  Out of the only 2 fights I got into with Mexicans...<br>  <br>   one of them I beat them so bad that the guy was about to cry, cuz I had kneed him in the face from a front headlock 30 times, and picked him up and slammed him on his head on the asphalt... he was so scared that I grabbed a hard 3" stick, tossed it at his feet, and said "come on fight me" and he STILL wasn't willing to fight me! <br>  (ps HE STARTED THAT FIGHT, TOO!)<br>  <br>  The other one was along the same lines as the first, but shorter.  One of them was going thru my backpack while I was at practice, and I see him in the locker room doing it.  Im like "wtf are you doing?" (NATURALLY, hes goin thru my stuff!) and hes like "stfu gringo". so i stick him in the face, then when he punches back I dodge it and ram him into the locker, then do a duck-under and get behind, lift him up from behind, and take him backwards, slamming his head into the tile.  He was knocked out COLD.  then i just took my bag... and left.<br>  <br>  ================<br>  <br>  So get these notions out of your head:<br>  <br>  1) that mexicans are tough- they're not any more tough than anybody else, and certainly not more than me.  They juts like to ACT tough and ghetto. and acting doesn't mean SH*T.  most of them smoke weed, eat greasy food, and dont work out, lift, or run... meaning that in a fight, they'd be weak and have no breath after a few seconds, and also dont know HOW to fight!  their only HOPE is a pistol!<br>  <br>  2) That mexicans are somehow "cool".  When they grow up, and their bad grades cause them to have to get a crappy job like construction or workign at Mickey D's, they will stop looking "cool" or "bad", and just be, well.... BAD- AT LIFE!<br>  <br>  3) That mexican culture is something to be proud of.  Because it advocates A) movign to america (implying america is better), and then at the same time DISSING AMERICA and vandalizing it; B) the sexual, physical, and verbal abuse of women; C) violence, sex, drugs, and immorality; D) obesity and unhealthy foods; E) ignorance; and lastly, F) a distorted, perverted version of Christianity, where if you wear a "Mexican Jesus" T-shirt you will go to heaven, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU FOLLOW THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS CHRIST!|`|AA11660242	You don't need to show them that you're Mexican.

Perhaps you are better off being yourself and starting with that as a basis for a relationship.  If you want to "impress them so they see who I truly am"  ( I did add the correct capitalization of the "I" to that quote and I corrected your spelling of truly), then you should start off by being yourself.  But, I have a feeling that isn't going to happen here.
rqFbNhAGaa	no there is nothing wrong going to a funeral and offering your respect.<br>  the family is grieving and would prefer to have as many people as possible show their support|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	It isn't wrong, you should be attending to show your support for those that are grieving.  It is no different than publicized funerals, ie Casey Anthony, a fallen fireman, etc..
xXyy51Efaa	Well, I'm not French, but I do live in the U.S. California to be exact. It' s awesome. So what area of the U.S are you going to be living in. I basically know about California weather and that's about it. Well, there are a lot of stores to go too. The popular ones are Forever 21, Limited Too (girl store), Gap, Macy's, JCpenny's, Tilly's, Hot Topic (for the goth's), etc. Popular places to eat could be: the Cheesecake factory (fancy) Sisley's, Cinnabon( incredible), Jamba Juice (like ice fruit blended drinks), STARBUCKS! (totally popular coffee place, Coffee Bean (another coffee place), P.F Changs, (chinese), etc. And A LOT of fast food places (mc donalds, carls jr., jack in the box, etc, I suggest you don't eat at those places), there are great beaches if you live along the coast or near it, nice weather in the summer and spring, can be hot, cold, rainy weather in the winter, not snowing in Cal. though, schools are great if you go to one, nice followed free ways, right now it's windy in Cal... I could tell you anything, and a lot more, but that's a little view of the U.S from a 14 year old girl. I hope you have fun living in the U.S, and beware of economic troubles! Byebye! :D
GeruGGOQaa	I'm sure every state is different but here in Virginia it depends on how much money the spouse makes.  For instance here if the spouse makes within 70% of the main bread winner there is no spousal support awarded unless there are extenuating circumstances.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	He will not be paying alimony.  The determining factor is the amount of time they were married.  Also, she works, there is no reason for him to have to pay anything.|`|TiaoTFecaa	Depends on the length of time that you guy's were married.<br>  <br>  The court will decide|`|8ilHQMq5aa	hes not going to have to. she works. therefore she doesnt need the suuport|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	i really don;t know ask someone whos been  in this situasion are whos been throw a divoce|`|BMEMH7JLaa	The Judge|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Individual income and length of marriage determines alimony.
