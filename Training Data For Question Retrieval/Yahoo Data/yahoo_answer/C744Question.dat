We're both into photography so here's what I had in mind:      Wake up early and take a trip to a private beach and park and bring the camera along. Even though it's February... I figured it would make it that much more romantic (since no one would be there). It will be just above 0 degrees.       What im wondering is... what should we do there? Im open to any ideas!

Last time I made this recipe (butter, chocolate, sugar, pinch of salt, vanilla, eggs, flour) I cooked it for too long and it was slightly over-cooked. The recipe says to cook it at 160 degrees Celsius (375 Farenheit) for 35 to 40 minutes, but our oven is really hot, so I cooked it for 20, took it out, didn't think it was cooked, and put it in for another 10 minutes (30 minutes total), only to take it out again, over-cooked!

Hey, my oven is broken, so I just have a crockpot, a stove, and a microwave. I'm going to get some chicken and pork at the store, but I'm sick of frying and boiling them. Are there any other ways to cook them?      I've also been pairing them often with rice, noodles, etc. I put some chicken in soup, etc... It's fun but I'm getting kind of sick of it.

20090220150656AAAmvf6	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How do you get the coating to stay on pan-fried chicken?	Hey, I've been cooking a lot lately and I've tried making fried chicken tenders (to put on sandwiches, and to eat with ranch). I tried two different ways.      First, I dipped the chicken strips in egg and then rolled them in a mixture of flour and seasonings. I've done this before with baking and it was great. But when I fried it, almost nothing stayed on! It had a lot of flavor, though.      When I made the second batch, I mixed the flour and seasonings, and then added the egg directly to it and I beat it well. It was orange and slimy, and didn't coat the chicken all over like the first mixture did, so it was spotty, but where it did coat it, it had more flavor and it was thicker, which I like. However, most of the coating fell off during frying that time, too!      I don't move them around that much; just once after I'm afraid it'll burn the first time around, and then twice to check the other side. Maybe I'm frying them wrong... I usually just put some olive oil on the bottom of the pan, I don't submerge the chicken strips.      What am I doing wrong?

20090220151337AAAohP5	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Starbucks Sicilian Lemon Cupcake Frosting?	Hello, This is a question for a Pastry Chef.. please help me with your expertise..   I'm trying to figure out what kind of Icing/Frosting is being used on the Starbucks Sicilian Lemon Cupcake.      There is a picture of the Cupcake on Flikr:    http://www.flickr.com/photos/smileygeekg...       It looks like the Icing is very sugary but when you taste it, it does not have that horrible Butter taste. The Ising is very stiff and sugary. Does Anyone what kind of Icing/Frosting it is and how to make it? A recipe would be greatly appreciated.      Many thanks.. xxx

I am wrestling with a 2-1/2 lb butternut squash (what the recipe called for), and the squash is winning!  Either I need to eat some Wheaties first, I'm older than I thought, or there has got to be an easier way to peel, cut and seed one of these things.      I wondered if I should pre-cook it like sweet potatoes, but I wasn't sure how long or whether that would rob it of all the color and nutrients that is supposed to go into the soup.      IS there an easier way? (Besides calling my husband to cut it for me....)

But anyways, here's how i make it:      You start by putting a tortilla on a buttered frying pan, then add cheese, when the cheese is melted pull the tortilla off, and wrap it around a cooked hot dog. I like it with either some kind of hot sauce, or barbecue.      Has anyone done this?    If you have, what condiments do you do it with?
