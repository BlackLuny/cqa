WZVz5jWHaa	Wow....that's a lot of kids in a family.  My husband lived in a house of 11 kids. He is the 4th from the bottom. I can tell you that when my husband was growing up, he had to make his own entertainment and did not depend on anyone else to do anything or give him anything.  He just did it all for himself.  He began working at a very young age to make his own spending money. So, you are being a bit over dramatic.  YOU have to be the one that makes things happen in your life -- not your family. Get your own friends and make them very close friends. Make your life outside your family and you will feel fulfilled. BTW, my husband was the in the marching band at school and not once did his family come to see him march. As an adult, my husband is a very good family man who is independent and provides for his family.  You can do the same if you want to.|`|8056ecfab04b38bab36a2a73cb0e65fdaa	honey dont know who you are but sorry to hear about your lifestlye...im a mother and your not being overdramatic,,but be yourself and enjoy life to the fullest that u can...just accept the way things are right now and get a job as soon as you can to help yourself and meet new people to talk to and associate with to help u along the way..the problem wont go away by itself YOU have to take another step in your life to make it better for yourself...just hang in there and respect and love yourself for who you are...GOOD LUCK|`|IEQqdYO2aa	I think you are being a little over dramatic   they don't hit you and they don't verbally abuse you either   so its not abuse more like showing favorites|`|lBZkXzr0aa	I don't think that you are overreacting about how you think you should be treated.  You are being abused mentally and emotionally.  It is not fair that you are being treated this way.  I will say that I hear your side and I don't agree with it but their are 2 sides to every story.  You need to sit your parents and siblings down and have a family meeting and let out  how you are feeling?  If they are unresponsive and not willing to meet u half way then you may need to see a school guidance counselor or psychologist to intervene on your behalf.      Good Luck and I hope you find what you are looking for.|`|a0MOldiYaa	That's not right !  im very sorry to hear your story :(  and im going to try to help you!  you should talk to a counselor at schoool, that might help !  or how bout talk to your mom or dad ( which ever you feel more comfortable talking to ) and tell them, exaktly what you told us !  just tell it from the heart, or how bout write them a letter ? i used to do that when im shy or nervous to talk to my parents about something !   or just go strait forward and tell your parents, im not having any atention, and i feel left out emotionaly and mentaly , and this ,this and this ....    Don't worry :) everything is going to be great soon :D just think positive ! if you think positive then positive things will happen ! but try to look at the bright side at life ! everyday before you go to bed thing what was the negetive things that happend today and what was the positve !     If i were you , i would write your mom a letter, or go hug her and tell her anything thats in your heart (: just let it go ! :D    i hope i helped ! if you need anything email me at : d.alabdulaaly@hotmail.com :D    xx|`|tWD175Pjaa	If what you say is true then you are being treated very unfairly. You should try to relax a little maybe even chase after a girl or two lol. your childhood will be missed when its gone believe me and sometime its harder when you come from a big family to find your place. sounds like your a good kid and the "note"  you left well i hope your not serious because it would truly be a tragic thing to happen. sit and talk with your mom and dad and tell them how you feel and how serious this situation has become. If you were here id give you a big hug kid hope life turns around for you and i hope you grow to be a wonderful young man who dose good for himself in life.|`|VHjipZdzaa	Though you mention that you are from a well to do family, but trust me times are bad now. The economic condition of the world is very bad at the moment and it is very well possible that they are only trying to save money. I am the elder brother in my family. I have a younger brother. The last time when there was economic slow down, my brother used to wear the old clothes of mine. :-( I used to get the new clothes. But trust me that never meant that my parents loved him any less. I just wanted to mention this to present the other side which you are probably not able to see.    Your assumptions could be wrong because you are already biased by your beliefs. It is quite natural for a young sister to get all the attention. It happens in many families. I want to ask you a couple of questions. When your parents take your brothers to restaurants, did you try to find out why exactly they don't tak you? Did you ever express your wish to go to the restaurant? Did they refuse to take you to the restaurant even after you expressed your wish to go?    In my family I was the smartest kid in terms of studies. My parents didn't take me out a lot unlike my younger brother because they felt that I enjoyed studies more. They did not buy me a bicycle too initially. Only after I told them that I need a bicycle, I got one. May be they don't want to disturb you and spend your time well with studies and become an academically successful person in your life like Donald Knuth, Claude Shannon, Richard Feynman, etc. (Do look them up in Google to learn about them)    However, I understand that you know your family more than me. Probably, what I have written above just does not hold true for your family. May be your parents are really neglecting you. Even if it is so, let me tell you, one thing. Don't give up. Don't be defeated in your life. So what if your parents don't give you the attention you deserve? You live your own life and try to excel and show them how you can be best in what you do even though they don't pay the attention you deserve.

TaJWZ96paa	I had the same problem with my daughter.  It's called tough love. Kick her out she'll either sink or swim.    My daughter started swimming when she found out that no one was holding her up any more. Do not take her back she will not be cured if you do.    My daughter is 34 now and living a better life and is married.|`|cTM6vQeBaa	Depending which state you live in there are state facilities that could help your daughter. You will probably have to get the coroner and a physician involved. The best way to do this if she's not willing is through the emergency room. She will end up with an emergency room bill, but so what as long as she gets the help she needs. I would do whatever it took to get her help.  My family just experienced this problem with a family member she was found dead at 32 years old, due to alcoholism/liver failure.

Although she does not have any insurance, I'm sure the hospital/clinic will be able to help with payment plans/financial assistance. Do you have a job? Can you add her to your health insurance benefits from work?

Be prepared for a cultural backlash though.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	You can do what you like at 18 - they can't stop you.  But you will probably have to go it alone.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	its not because your a muslim. its because your family has strict values. so please dont get culture and religion mixed up. its because of people like you who get culture and religion mixed up and mess things up for everyone. stop being so selfish and grow up.     muslim or not every parent goes through this with their children. compromise! you dont need a boyfriend your only 16 just get an education get a job have a nice time you only live once. and you only have one set of parents too.|`|paquf4dFaa	Behead them|`|CEKAqtB1aa	Leave!

Let the social life wait, make lots of friends, try to involve her ( I know it ain't kewl) but show her you can make good decisions by example....

For me, Islam is the best religion, okay thats biased. But i cannot imagine my life without Islam. Seriously, do you want to end up pregnant like most girls who give it away without a thought. **** I'm being horrible aren't I? Okay, let me calm down, They only want the best for you. It's really good that you're focused on your studies, really. But having a boyfriend messes things up, ive seen so many girls who've had boyfriends, only to get dumped. Nd guess what, they were married through arranged because their parents did not trust them and no other parents wanted a girl like that. I'm sixteen too, to be honest, my parents are the same and I'm glad they are like that to put me in the right place. Sorry man, im having a  rant.

c39769d53063a6d985c30fc12864ee87aa	Well like you said you were 13. I will tell you now that you shouldn't keep worrying about this guy, because like you said yourself he ended up just wanting to get into your pants and guys will say anything to get you to do what they want especially when your that young. There are sooo many more guys out there that you will like better and you should just forget him it sounds like your in lust with him you will soon forget about him and find someone else that didnt move far far away and only sees u a couple times. I dont know how old you are now but im 21 and i have been through several boyfriends enough to where i know you shouldnt just stop after finding one you "kinda like" and if your still aroung 13 you definetly shouldn't be settling down with a guy too seriously. Have Fun and by that i mean date different guys and you will see what kind of guy you will want in the end.     Good Luck!    Flyaquariusgirl|`|DOZxFiijaa	uhuh. if you go after this boy. of you moved on, you will learn something. if you chase him, even when you lose, it will be a great experience for you. but you regret it lawould regret it later if dont then you would be curious.     youre 13, do something you like, everything will pass, just enjoy|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	Don't worry, you're still young.

This tells me that you should not have anything to do with him. You are way too young for that. You are just a child. Regardless of what you think you are, you ARE a CHILD. He is a liar, at best. Don't mess with him.    Regards,  Dan

Hope things go well|`|X9RBRqL2aa	she said all that other stuff before she hung out with you. she likes you. stop worrying about what she said before.    she likes you|`|E5n8tRKoaa	dude, do you have the basic concept of punctuation down, or is that just the way you talk? not to be an englich teacher, but man, that's a lot of runon sentences.     anyway, you should ultimately just ask her.     if you like her, you should probably just start with telling her so, and see where it goes from there.|`|JVrjveubaa	yeah ok well first off, your stupid. my sister said she only likes tall guys with blue eyes and brown hair..shes getting married to a guy that's okish tall not really not blue eyes and hes blondish..my point is,girls dont just go by what their"prince charming"is suppose to look like. that's just a thing they can still like other people. so yes she likes you, she told you she likes you. the ex gf and bf dating thing you just need to ask her about. otherwise your good. like her back. dont let the dark hair thing get under your skin its not a big deal at all. goold luck|`|A885td7Jaa	hair colour? omg wat has d world come 2?

AND ITS JUST HAIR COLOR SO THERE COULD BE A POSSIBILITY THAT SHE IS STARTING TO LIKE YOU     2) IF SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE ANOTHER GUY JEALOUS TRUST ME YOU WOULD KNOW, BECAUSE SHE WOULD ONLY ACT LIKE SHE LIKES YOU WHEN A CERTAIN GUY IS AROUND    AND IM TELLING YOU FROM A GIRLS POINT OF VIEW LISTENING TO THE GIRLS FRIENDS REALLY DOESN'T GET YOU ANYTHING, THEY CAN BE BEST OF FRIENDS BUT TRUST THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY KNOW EVERYTHING.. THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH IS IF YOU HEAR IT OUT THE GIRLS MOUTH... IF I WERE YOU I WOULD JUST BRING IT UP IN A CONVERSATION , IT CANT HURT!!!!!!!!
oeUvBzvkaa	First, i completely understand.. I'm like that as well! Whenever i get the chance to be with somebody, i just get totally turned off, don't wanna go there, and do nothing more about it. Then, afterwards, i regret it.. and the cycle continues. I don't know why, though..     Would you feel comfortable just being good friends with him now? That way, you'd be with him without being, well, WITH him, and hurting him. And don't go out with him again, even though you do want to now- it'll only end up hurting him, and make him wonder why things are the way they are. I'd start looking for other guys, maybe it'll take your mind off of him.|`|AA11501437	because the grass is always greener - until we make it to the other side of the fence.  many people - and especially women are this way.  we always think what we dont have is better than what we do have.  also, we are fairly emotion based -   good day = we love everyone.    bad day = we question and find fault in everything.    stupid laws of nature and hormones.|`|gIszhbQNaa	What a dilemma.     My suggestion: Take a time to reflect. What is more convenient to you? Have him around, or not?|`|3a14e81c67aea9721d43997a7afd76a7aa	Its mixed feelings, and you need to decide rather if you are or not happy with him....|`|zxa2fjpyaa	i think your situation is basically the saying "you want what you cant have"|`|bvwYVGJOaa	There's nothing wrong with you, you just need to stick to your mind and decision on what you definitely want this guy or go solo.

Don't make any decisions till you're sure.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	Serioulsy it sounds like you just like the chase. It sounds to me like you really aren't as in to him as you think, it is more of an infatuation and you wanting to see if you still have him. I say if you know you are hurting him you need to let him go!|`|qJMlzYQUaa	dont worry it happens to everyone. its the worst thing in the world.  there was this lad that used to like me loads and i never liked him until he moved away and got a girlfriend then i was like in love with him for like ages after.  its ****, its just the human thing to want what you cant have.    the turth is you probably dont really like him. when it comes down to it when you find someone you really like. youll know and youll be happy with them and theyll be happy with you at thwe same time xx|`|belxnL86aa	have sex with him. its the only way. and after you're done with him chop his penis off and send it to disneyland for a special treat from mickey mouse. dispose of the remainings of his body in a frozen lake where nobody will ever see him again.|`|yM8NiXmLaa	well... it means u still really like him bacause you want to be with him but you dont want to hurt him again... its ok... thas the only reason why you dont want to be around him when you are... hope this helps...

It just depends on if the girl moves on or not.|`|n463milpaa	omg girls could crush on a guy forever.  they could have a crush in highschool comeback for a 40 yr reunion and still remember their crush.. hopefully the moved on. but you never forget a crush i dunno why.|`|Y2sDswLBaa	idk  a few weeks?|`|m5aenb6qaa	some girl looses interest once they see something not good about the guy. the others are infatuated blindly. so it really depends.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	What i really think here is that yr still young and can make lots of friends wherever u r, here or there.. so dont stop and refuse because its not gonna work, maybe there r things that u dont know about why she wants to move, things u cant understand now because yr still young.     Honestly just dont do a thing and move with her, u will like it wherever u r, and u will have new friends and still when u grow up u can return back and c yr friends again.     _K_
3zm0jA0yaa	You have to let him know that for every penny he takes out on a loan or charges on a credit card that you are responsible, in the long run, for one half of it. So half of the consideration on wheather to do it or not should be yours, as far as input and deciding to do it or not. It sounds like you had no opinion on wheather or not to take out this loan. And that's just wrong. If your name is on the loan then you should have been in on the decision. Did they pay you back for the first loan? If no I'd be livid! If they did then mabe you will get the money back but  it will not probably come back to you for quite some time. I'd let my husband know right now that I am in on any decisions to take out loans from now on,.|`|rR5nIklWaa	you def. need to talk to ur hubi  and explain to him  how you aready helped them  and how they need to  be reasposable they need to cut out all the extra things right now
f6VhiYJeaa	ok, the looking for other woman thing is a whole nother matter    but the porn, you need not to take it so seriously. its just fun to him, its nothing!    try next time hes at the computer going in wearing sexy things when ya sons asleep and make him want you, not the computer.    maybe even watch porn while you're having sex then maybe you'll appreciate it a little more too    remember, he's a man|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Instead of blowing up at him because of his porn viewing, why not take another approach and ind out why he's viewing it?    Could be he doesn't have the balls to ask you to do something in bed, so he watches the porn to fulfill that desire.    Could be he's wanting to watch it with you, but doesn't know how to ask.    Just ask him and talk about it calmly. Stop blowing up at him, don't be jealous, don't be mad. Just be curious as to why he feels he should need it. Work with him about it, let him explain his reasons.    When he gets done explaining, you think about it. Again don't get mad or anything, but try to find a compromise with him about it. Maybe there is something you both can do together to help him. Seems like your marriage doesn't have much communication. And no, yelling and blowing up isn't communication.|`|NqAzcrtsaa	I'm sorry for your problem. Maybe you should take the computer away from him, or install parental controls with you as the adminstrator? The damn internet has destroyed many lives.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Learn to live with it or leave him.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	All I can say to you, is that if it were me, I'd probably leave him.  You've had the "big blow ups", you've had his baby, he's cried, and yet he is still at it.  I say "probably", because let's face it - you have a child with him, and it would be nice if you guys COULD work it out.  But, he most likely has an addiction that he needs help with.  So, at this point, you could approach him with that and see what he says.  But if he does commit to getting some help, he MUST make the effort, and make it now.  If he doesn't want to make the effort or anything, then obviously his taste for porn is stronger than his feelings for you and your child.  At that point, you have to make the decision as to whether or not that's enough for you.  Good luck, I hope everything works out for you....|`|6uRYYQz6aa	I agree with SCOTT N KYLE, but instead of YOU leaving the house make HIM leave.    The internet is a great thing, but so bad in many ways. I hate porn, it's fake (regardless of what men think) and it's VERY degrading to women. I feel physically sick when i think that every single one of my boy mates (we're 15) are on the internet watching porn.    I should get out of this relationship before it gets any worse, your hurting yourself by staying with that jerk and your son may get to a certain age where he's browsing the internet and stumbles across one of his daddys porn sites.    Your a smart, intelligent, beautiful woman and you deserve the best.  Keep your chin up hunny, you'll be fine.    All the best xx|`|YS6G7Vevaa	I wouldn't put up with that at all, the porn is bad enough but him chatting to others on the internet that is aw full if he loves you then he wouldn't do that. He may try and Always cover it up but your always find out believe me. Your worth more then that leave him. Don't put up with a twat. Im so angry reading this to what he has done to you. I hope your be okay. Have you got friends you can go and stay with or anything? It will be hard but think to yourself can you stay with a man like that? All the time it will be on your mind to what he is doing, you wont be able to really ever trust him again deep inside. Why do men do this!!! You Take care.|`|k8BIPMuTaa	deal with it :)|`|F8iYNurEaa	I feel so sorry for you as he is being completely disrespectful of your relationship by behaving like this. Not only that, but he knows that this habit could destroy your relationship and destroy your son's family home and still he carries on like this. By saying that you don't feel hurt or angry anymore suggests to me that this relationship has run it's course. If it was just the porn issue I might be able to forgive this man, however, the fact that he is looking for "discreet friends" says that even if he hasn't cheated on you yet, there is a high chance that he will do in the future. I would get out while you can and find a man who knows how to treat you well. You deserve better than this.|`|56c8f841a1dad74f7e2d7fb94b7f4355aa	I get so so sick and tired of these do gooder answers of, its normal, accept it etc, I do not think it is normal or healthy in a relationship for a partner to constantly be sneaking looks at porn (or openly) a lot of people are addicted to porn my ex one of them. It makes a lot of women feel betrayed, unloved, inadequate and gives low self esteem and it made me feel like that too, that's 1 reason I left, made me feel empty inside and totally unloved/desired. Why don't you whiter than white women stop giving it the bullshit of being normal/natural, you're obviously coyote ugly so your partners need porn! If you have a good sex life I do not think porn is needed or normal or healthy.  I think this lady should give him a certain amount of time to change then if it doesn't call it a day and find someone who deserves a loving wife and son.
AA11826328	For starters you did the right thing by giving her time to cool off and at the same time you let her know that you were always thinking of her by sending her the flowers and things, GOOD JOB!!! (smile)  Now, what you need to do now is to invite her out to lunch or dinner, something nice but not too pushy, just let her know that you have saw the era of your ways and that you are ready to commit to her and take it from there, a woman loves honesty but, not too over bearing you know what I mean?

I think you are going to have to get over this one, as painful as it is, for now. Your effort is appreciated. But there are many more girls who will appreciate and reciprocate your romance and affection.   I think you had best find someone that is willing to move forward with you. good luck.
vrACGkKBaa	Sweetie i think you should ask him out to lunch as a friend and if he says yes with no questions then he likes you he just don't want to interfere with the relationship you have going on now. But on the other hand you could just have a lil small crush and the reason that he lets you almost anything in his house is because he sees you as his best friend whom he trust and respect. Just go see.
JuNf9cnJaa	This is a tough one....  Honestly.... it is her right to only have a small wedding, but it does put you in a difficult situation too.  I don't understand how adding one more person can REALLY affect the "budget"?  It's one person.  It sounds like to me they are already cutting corners BIG time by having such a small gathering, so why not let you the maid of honour have your partner to share the wedding with.  I think if you explained to her like this that you 2 are in a relationship, and weddings and things like that are obviously something you 2 are interested in together and would also give you someone to talk to when the only people who are at her wedding are people you aren't really close to except for the bride and groom which they are not going to have time for you because, well... it's their wedding..  So having your partner there will give you company and also give you the chance to share the experience with one another.    If the money thing is truly an issue, perhaps tell her you don't mind pitching her some cash to make lite of the situation.    If truly she wants to have this a small quiet wedding though you can't infringe on that, after all, you wouldn't want someone telling you how to run your wedding would you?    Tell your bf you are really sorry if she says no... again it's not even the exciting part of the wedding anyway?  The ceremony is the most boring part unless it's your own wedding... so tell him to man up and go chill with his buddies that day, or have some people over and meet him there to hang out once the wedding is over.  I'm sure once everything is all said and done he'll be happier about getting to chill with a few friends then watching a wedding.... besides the best part is still to come and he IS invited to that... so don't back out on your friend... just make sure you can make ulternate plans for your partner to take his mind off the fact that he isn't apart of it.    Hope this helped.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	Give your friend a break. It's her wedding. When I got married, we only had my Mom, my brother, and my hubby's parents. I had to tell a lot of people that we just weren't having any more people. My brother did not bring his gf.

Now you could still go out with him but personally if i were you i would find someone closer to your age. Just be careful and dont let his sweet talking fool you. You have a long ways to go with guys and im 21 so i know that you shouldnt take this bf/gf thing that seriously at your age. you have plenty of time so just take it slow! I would be careful and while i definetly think at 13 your a little young to be having sex well thats just my opinion and before and if you do be careful because theres a lot of things you need to make sure you know everything.

After doing what you did to him, and him asking you to move so he can watch the TV, that is selfish.

Usually 21 yr olds are all bout sex, 24/7. You need to talk to him and ask him what is going on. You really need to get him to be honest with you, if he want, then you might want to move on. He could be cheating on you too. Even if he is not, who wants to be married with someone who won't talk about what is bothering them, especially when it effects the bedroom.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Did you ever think that this may have absolutely nothing to do with you? Sure its easy to take it personally but not everything is about you. Your 18 years old. You will be in for a lot of disappointments in life, maybe its time you took a step back and stopped being so selfish about it.  He wasn't in the mood. Wait till you get older, have kids, blah, blah, blah and you will not always be in the mood.  Men don't just want a sexual relationship. Your married and in for the long haul.   And your sex drives are not always going to be on the same page. As the older you both get, he will leave his peak years before you enter yours.     Maybe get the TV out of your bedroom. TVs are not at all romantic.
AA10975867	If your fiance is mature enough and man enough to get married, he should be mature enough and man enough to be firm with his groomsmen and set the rules - no booze until the reception. Same with your bridesmaids. Tell them how much the photos cost and how much you want them to look their best! Becasue you are the "emotional bride", you are allowed some tears so a few days beforehand, call each girl and cry and weep and tell them how scared you are that the guys will drink and spoil your day. If each girl is even half-decent, she will sympathize with you and promise not to drink . You could also make the girls SWEAR a pledge at your rehearsal. Actually the best thing I have actually witnessed was done at the rehearsal. The Priest was a very likeable guy and the bride asked him to mention certain things. At the rehearsal, he first complimented the groom and his guys, said how lucky both the bride and groom were to have such wonderful friends. Then he told them about how some birdes had their wonderful days ruined by thoughless people, that he was certain that none "of these wonderful friends" would be so hurtful. He then asked everyone to stand up in front of him and he said a prayer - it was short but to the point. He asked God to watch over the couple, to make their special day as perfect as possible. He asked God to give these wonderful people the good sense to know how to be respectful of His house, to refrain from alcohol before coming to His house and to give each and every one of them the good grace of finding someone special to love as well. Guess what? Everyone turned up sober and they waited until the dance to let loose. The wedding was half Irish Catholic, half Ukrainian Catholic so this was a really big deal for all of people involved and much appreciated by the parents.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I have some pretty hard-drinking friends too (mainly the guys, and, well, I must admit, the groom too!!)  I'm sure there will be quite a few drunks at my wedding, but as long as everyone has a designated driver and nobody gets belligerent or out-of-control, I don't care if they overindulge a little.  If you have a few drunk groomsmen, it won't be the worst thing in the world.  In fact, it might help them with nerves, as long as they don't get so drunk that they barf on the aisle or pass out or anything awful like that.  But if they're heavy drinkers to begin with, I would assume they can probably hold their liquor pretty well.  People with a high tolerance can usually have 4-5 cocktails before it starts to really show.  Bottom line: they're your friends and your fiance's friends and you love them.  You know how they are and they can't be controlled.  But if you make it clear that it matters to you, if they really love and care about you, they should make the effort to cut down on their pre-wedding cocktails for your sake.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Ummm...the best I can suggest is that the guys in the wedding party not gather together until it is time for them to arrive at the wedding venue before the ceremony.

I have concerns that your friends don't respect you guys enough to not drink for 8 hours.  Perhaps put it to them this way and they'll get a clue.  Otherwise, fire them and get different attendants.|`|I3V7hE32aa	At the rehearsal dinner, the minister at my sister's wedding warned the entire bridal party that if he smelled any alcohol he would not conduct the ceremony.    I think it's wise to speak to your pastor and ask him to say this same thing to your bridal party at the rehearsal.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Out of sheer respect for you and your husband to be they should curb their drinking until the appropriate time.  If they have such a drink problem then maybe you should not have invited them until the evening when all the speeches and toasts are out of the way, I would not have anyone spoiling my day friend or no friend.
MLdykhQNaa	I felt like I wasted alot of ammunition on the ceiling when I walked in initially.|`|dPULl5hjaa	dude, your English sucks|`|cTM6vQeBaa	Are you talking about taking pictures????  Go by your customers reaction and learn from it. Don't quit just because you got a lil stressed. The more you do something the better you are going to get at it, just learn something each time you do it and know that you did your best. And whatever the customers reaction don't let it get you down. Be confident. If you get to the point to where you just don't enjoy it and don't want to do it, then quit.|`|g2XbXYyraa	why the **** would shooting up a wedding be stressful?  it would be the complete opposite of that. imagine ******* up all the decorated/fancy ****...  imagine the epic..
nQEDUPFgaa	It bugs you because you HAD feelings for him in the PAST.  You probably don't feel anything for him now, but the fact is, you use to.    It's more like:  "your trying to make a happy life with someone I've already had"|`|VLzXypQ4aa	That is a tough one because you are only human, but you have to let him go and just be supportive about it to your cousin. They are together for a reason and you have to accept that. It wont be easy but important for you to come to terms with.|`|gIszhbQNaa	Move on. Go out and meet new people. Your find your new love sooner than you expect.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Dude! I am so sorry about this! This sucks for you. Umm, just tell him that you might still have feelings for him, maybe he will postpone the wedding and think about it. Don't tell her though, that would be VERY bad. Good luck.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Express to her that although you are indeed over it, it's still a sensetive subject and hopefully she will be mature and respect your wishes.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	it sounds to me like you are jealous, maybe not of them, but of what they have??? Only you can really answer this, are you sad that maybe you aren't in that place in your life? or do you miss him? I say find something to focus on in your own life, something that you are proud of!|`|mdtkor2Paa	no problem|`|yM8NiXmLaa	that's freaking weird but its normal to feel that way because you had strong feelings for the person at one time but now that person is with someone who is close to you so all those feelings cant go away... hope i helped........|`|6sYXUc1caa	uhmm talk to her about it i guess
M85Dn5Ccaa	I would seek legal help.  If you can't afford it then I would call around lawyers to see if they have a free consultation.  You can always file in your states family court for sole custody just don't make it sound like you are jealous in the court papers.  State facts like he doesn't attend to our son when he wakes up in the night or how is is mentally and emotionally abusing you.  Write everything down and do not mention his new girlfriend or her kids, that will only make you look like you are out to get him.  Stay positive, if your son is in a daycare ask them to write up something for you reflecting that you are his main provider.  You take him and pick him up all the times.  Think of your son, and do what you feel is best for him.  Child support is another case you can file for in your states family court.  I would seek advice from a lawyer.    Good Luck!  Hope I helped some?|`|kbIkVS0raa	You have to go to court and file a motion. It is the only way to have it on paper and official. Just be prepared because he may want to fight it if he is an ***.
tWD175Pjaa	Im not sure how old you are but everytime your about to slack off think about your dad and put more effort into everything , school,when your at home, sports whatever just be the best possible man or women you can be. because when your older that will be the best tribute you could have possible given your father. To show the world that your as great as you are because of your father it would make him proud.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	It sounds like you and your Dad were close. Why not plant a tree in his honor at a local park? It will grow, be around a long time, and provide beauty to the area. You can always visit "him" and sit under its branches when you feel you need to reflect on your life with him.|`|zxyMf6cJaa	Thats very sweet. Be a good human being and be a good parent in future.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Its a mess i confess, you can start by building yr own group and invite some neutral friends, then start by yr friends in both groups, start inviting them one by one, choose the best and close friends first, i mean by priority. Try it one step after the other, and by no time u will find all yr good friends in one group and leave the arguing friends alone.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Group A insults Group B....insults you for being with Group B  Sounds to me as if Group A is the group who you don't want to associate with due to the behaviors that they are exhibiting. If you truly have friends with Group A....then they will see you took a stance and decided that the behavior that they have is not the behavior you want to example yourself with. Maybe one day they will have enough guts to remove themselves from the negativity that is being produced.   I myself prefer to be with those that show love than hate. Hate grows so fast, faster than love|`|AA10798898	you answered your own question in your title, bad friend situation....theres alot of good genuine people still out there, be patient, I would lose group A and B, f*ck em' they all sound like drama. you can do better w/ yur choice of friends...good luck.|`|GcZRN4kkaa	Here is what you do; you forget about one group. You can't be part of both of them and if you try to unite them, they will both dislike you. The only thing i can think of is that you should think of which friends you value more and choose that group. Also, from the way you put it across it seems like Group A seem like nasty people and Group B have done nothing. I don't know. But you have to choose a side soon or you're going to lose them both.     Hope I helped.|`|z2DmmhqJaa	I think that whatever you decide to do, Group B will always love you :]|`|37TBeQXsaa	I totally agree with the user above me. Even if some people in group A love you, as a whole, group B sound like they love you even more and you can know that as a fact.  Also, I can tell you that group B love you for who you and aren't going to be childish about who you decided to be friends with,  You are your own [strange and wonderful] being, and we will always love you for who you are, no matter what you do.  Also, you have the fittest god damn walk in the whole sodding world, and I could never replace a walking buddy like you.  Love you so much. Lets walk on the gra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ound of the boulevard, [like what I did? *winks*]  I LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH XX
RDgyb7W8aa	See if at dinner you can talk to them.  Say mom dad have I been everything wrong recently.  The reason I ask is that you seem to argue after I say of don't do something.  With this question they might realize that they shouldn't argue.  Good Luck|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	evidently they are having problems and your adding to it.  try to keep your mouth shut about things you shouldn't be commenting on and try to do things the way you are supposed to be doing them.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	No, Sammy, it isn't your fault your parents are fighting. very often, kids get caught in the middle. Talk to your parents and let them know how upsetting this is for you. If they don't help you, go to a guidance counselor, pastor, or another trusted adult.

Wow, that's epic fail... if their fights start because of you then it most certainly is your fault. <br>  <br>  And it's not ex. It's e.g.|`|UHWPNLOzaa	I don't believe it's your fault dear, when parents or adults arent getting along or just have issues with each other they tend to lash out at others close to them instead of the person they are really mad or upset with. I don't know why we do it but we adults always do I remember when I was married and very unhappy with my marriage I would look for the smallest thing to go off on just to make me feel better when what i really wanted to do was go off on my husband. It took me two more relationships to finally realize what I was doing and to stop doing it. It's not your fault and make sure you talk to your parents about how you are feeling they may not even be aware that they are putting you through this. Good Luck.
0d7o8ptmaa	Because we love Marcia.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	because Jan just whines too much|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Because she is a skank.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Because she is better than everyone one else in the house and everyone knows it.

Im not saying at this stage she should spend 24/7 with you, or ever for that matter, but she should be doing something to earn such trust. Don't you ever go out with her?|`|GmTMVmASaa	if you trust her to death, you would not be feeling this way. you need to divert your worries towards something positive, not all women are bad.|`|AA11208683	with time things will heal and your paranoia will go away, but this is hard. i had a bad relationship with a guy he cheated on me multiple times and it was very hard to get into new relationships. i am married now and even though i get thoughts in my head like that i just remind my self that he loves me and he isn't like that selfish jerk that ruined my life. there are signs you can look for that show if she is cheating if that helps. if she is weird one day after going out, then you might just wanna ask if something is wrong. if she loves you and is good she i doubt is cheating on you. she loves you just remember that! GOOD LUCK!|`|0213a878584dfe668851e9dfd2d6a2e0aa	Talk to her and explain that you have trust issues because of past experiences. Then just try to trust her and if she is really into you she will be sensitive to your feelings and always let you know where and with who she is.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Maybe you need to take a step back and not date for awhile until you can get past the trust issues.

I like to mix it up and catch him off guard sometimes.|`|gLqX7TG0aa	mmm don't have spouse....so i guess it's UP to me|`|9fmkCRifaa	Most of the time, it's me. I'm very aggressive. He LOVES it. He would rather me be the one that makes that first move. He likes to be tackled. I always try to catch him by surprise. It's usually more aggressive sex when I take control. When he initiates sex, it's very romantic and sweet. <br>  <br>  <br>  OMG! Now I'm desperately wishing my husband wasn't deployed right now!|`|g3HrRmaCaa	I always make the first, second, even third move, that sh*t sucks.

I don't mind because wife always either says yes or is it ok if we make love tomorrow?  And then we do.  So my rejection rate is zero - being asked to be patient for one day is not a rejection, it is a short deferral.  And in the end, the rejection rate is the only thing that matters.  <br>  <br>  These guys who write in that their wives have only 3 times in the last 6 months and the wives are always saying no.  If that happened to me I would just say, I love you, I can't be "almost" celibate, so I am going to get a girlfriend until you decide you want me again.  <br>  <br>  I try to make our physical relationship strong by being a patient, considerate (she always gets to finish first) lover and by staying in really good shape.

ZDC81VjZaa	Saying your sorry at least gives you personal piece of mind... no harm there regardless if she accepts the apology or not.  You'll have said sorry more for yourself than for her, anyhow.  <br>  <br>  If she's saying hello at school and she don't mind that other people may hear her say it... then I sincerely doubt you've much to worry about.  She's comfortable with herself and her decision.  However... sometimes it COULD be for show.  You'll never know for sure til you and she get together and just say what's on your minds.  It's unfair for either of the two of you to guess and wonder the sincerity of the others actions.  Neither of you are professional mind readers, correct?  Get together.  Be on the level with each other and go from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|aEbk51zSaa	if she the one who sayin hi first<br>  maybe she misses u as a friend<br>  and yes wnats to be friends again<br>  <br>  i doubt shes just bein nice<br>  <br>  answer mien plz?|`|p9X6fX3naa	If shes is making the effort, sher probably wants to put it behind you guys and work it out.

It's also really difficult to get done, because you have to prove you can live on your own, support yourself, etc. Do you have any family members who can take you in, so you won't be in a foster home? If you do, you need to push to get moved there, because social workers have little-to-no incentive to place kids with relatives instead of a foster home.|`|dzbblpjgaa	What is so bad?

I was fostered too, I did not work hard at school and did catch up with my education later by doing evening classes. It was hard work.

So what if you can't get drunk and have one night stands! It takes a lifetime to find your soulmate and honestly I think once you find that person you should hold on. If you feel as if your giving up your life for the worse then don't get married...People should only get married if their fully commited...|`|iN6iidUwaa	Marriage is based upon mutual commitment.  Both people are assured through PROMISE a high level of security that they will have someone to help them in time of need.  Also, marriage allows for satisfaction from giving to the other person and watching that person achieve goals and happiness. So, it is about mutual giving and receiving.  From a physical standpoint, it allows for frequent encounters without fear of contracting STD's etc assuming that the marriage is healthy and both partners are monogamous.  It allows for greater financial wealth when the couple focuses on common financial goals and allows for more financial stability and flexibility when both people are working.  When children are created, then there is potential for more happiness watching the children develop and eventually have fruitful lives assuming nothing bad happens to any of them.<br>  <br>  The choice of being married vs. single is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong answer.  It depends on the individual.  I was married once before and was happy to be married for a long time.  Then, when things got bad, I wasn't happy to be married anymore.  I went through a period of time where I was planning on never getting married again.  Then, I re-connected with an old friend I have known for 30 years and I am getting married in April.  If it weren't her, it would be nobody because I would never do it again otherwise.  The main reason is that marriage is based upon those PROMISES and often they are broken. So, you have to really trust that other person a lot to really feel secure.|`|Chib4b8saa	I really don't know.

I used to believe that a piece of paper was all I needed to be happy - but I know so differently now. that piece of paper doesn't mean anything - it is the relationship that you have. I married my best friend and I couldn't be happier. Whether we have a piece of paper or not - doesn't matter. He is a witness to my life as I am witness to his, I will love him forever!|`|acToOsxjaa	I agree unles you have children or plan on having children. There is no point to have a paper that legally binds you to a person.

racnq84Vaa	You should sit down with both of your parents and ask your dad this ' Dad do you think it is right for women to be used and degraded solely as sex objects or used for merely for the sexual gratification of others?'  Then if he answers no, 'then why do you exploit them by using porn, those women are someone's daughters too.  Should I work in porn when I am older to get men off like you?'<br>  <br>  Balls to the wall, point on ask him.  Make him squirm.  And make him think about how he is treating women.  Because those women are someone's daughters.  And they do not deserve to be exploited anymore than you do.|`|PP1KswnAaa	you do realise this is absolutaly normal for older men unless they married then mabye their might be a problem<br>  im 15 and have cought my dad watching it o the best thing to do is sit down with him and talk to him saying it upsets you and he should think bout you and not the porn if he a caring father hell listen|`|2Hh0RuxLaa	Then go an talk to him about it.   <br>  <br>  But don't be surprised when he tells you to stop using his computer. or he hides the porn.     This is YOUR problem and not his cause you're having the problem.<br>  <br>  either get over it and realize he has needs or stay off his computer.<br>  <br>  LD|`|hvcjyEmDaa	since you share the computer, ask him to remove the sites when he is finished-that seeing it upsets you. If you feel too shy to ask, then just delete the stuff and don't look at it. If the sites he looks at don't include children doing sexual acts, it's legal.|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	Its fair for you to tell him you found it and you don't like it and you hope he stops (or at least keeps it to himself).  In the end though, once you've said your peace, its his choice and you have to let it go.|`|hL4nWbzmaa	you can install NetDog Porn Filter : <a href="http://www.netdogsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdogsoft.com</a> on the computer, netdog blocks all porn quitely and automatically in the background when your dad's on the computer.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	just go growup and stop the little i'm so innocent thing|`|Hx2raTNQaa	tell him how you fel and confront him hope i helped:))|`|50c0d5af3946117317070e958dd06f5daa	Go ahead and talk to him if you really feel the need to, but it's not going to accomplish anything. He's a man, they look at porn. He's probably looked at porn since he was around eighteen. It's really not that big of a deal, a LOT of people do it. <br>  <br>  I know it upsets you, probably makes you squirm with a decent amount of disgust, but it is what it is. You confronting him is just going to embarrass the hell out of the both of you. Your dad will still look at porn, just like he's still going to have sex with your mother. He's an adult, it's not illegal. How do you think you got here?<br>  <br>  If you just HAVE to confront him, try to be cool about it. Just ask him to clean up the evidence once he's done. If you're more comfortable talking to your mom, tell her. Ask her to discreetly tell your dad to no leave the porn where you can find it, because it IS pretty nasty thinking about your parents doing that. <br>  <br>  But really, you're getting to the age where you're going to be running into this type of situation a lot, not necessarily with your parents either. Just try to accept it, and if not, avoid a situation entirely, especially if you were going through his history on HIS computer.|`|yw9JDlnnaa	The sad truth is that just about every male out there will look at porn.  They can't help it.  It's how they are made.  I don't get it.  I don't necessarily like it but I think that us girls just have to accept it.  And if we can't accept it, we should try to pretend that it doesn't happen.  You could try talking to him about it but it will probably embarrass him immensely and lead to some tension and awkwardness in your relationship.  I think that it would be best for you to just try and forget it.  I know, easier said than done but do you really think that your father would be able to stop looking at the porn just because you want him to?  It's very unlikely.  My advice to you would be to just turn a blind eye and try to wipe it out of your head.  <br>  <br>  I know, not what you want to hear but I really think that it is the best advice for you.  Sorry.|`|bTuWjqUeaa	Talk to him. Let him know how you feel. He may not listen to you but comunication is the best way to start on resolving the issue.|`|Id1QW8wXaa	Your dad is a guy<br>  all guys fantasize<br>  <br>  just deal with it<br>  and dont confront|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Why do you care if he looks at porn? That is his personal preferrence and you should respect his privacy. Would you like it if he searched your computer? I say just ignore it and forget about it.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	It sounds like you are have already made your mind up to what you wanna do.  I is NOT illegal as long as he is NOT looking at children.  He should probably be more discreet so you won't know what he is looking at since he has a snoopy kid but if you are intent confronting him expect to have problems with him or to get disregarded.  He is an adult and is the one paying the bills so that gives him the right to enjoy the kind of recreation he enjoys.  He is your parent and does not have to answer to you.|`|6PbyKpHzaa	I really don't know why your upset? Or why it is any of your business that he watching porn? He is a adult he can do what he wants.|`|m8f7rnBEaa	It's natural and he's a man. How, exactly, do you think you came into this world?  It's none of your business.

AA11208683	this sounds like some one who wants to ruin your marriage. i agree with you bring it to his attention and see what he says about it. if he acts weird and doesn't give you straight answers than you know he is lying. i really wish you the best of luck and i hope he isn't!|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	No, no, no, no, no.  I have been in MANY similiar situations and the worst thing you could possibly do is lay your cards on the table.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive but you have to wait and observe signs.  If he is cheating, you will start noticing things.  If he isn't, then you'll watch and never see anything atypical, and that will be that.<br>  <br>  From my six years in the military I have learned that ANYONE could possibly be a cheater, but don't jump to conclusions.  Revealing what happened without at least SOME observation on your part could cause his cover stories to evolve and you'll have a more difficult time finding the truth.  Pay attention and google "How to catch a cheater".  There are pro private eyes that have devoted their whole lives to this.  Learn from them.<br>  <br>  Good luck finding the truth.<br>  <br>  Spence|`|FMfAcAGpaa	Are you sure he is at work?  If you haven't previously suspect ted anything I wouldn't worry.  Some sicko joke maybe?  Did they know any details, his name, his job, typical habits?  With whom is he supposed to be cheating?  Without some of that I would not worry.  Good luck!|`|acToOsxjaa	Bring it to his attention but do not accuse him of it. You should trust him more than someone that remains anonymous. Ultimately he is your husband and if it did happen hear him out. Just don't assume anything! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8o7s9tynaa	This is someone who is mischief making. The anonymity gives that away. I wouldn't take it seriously at all! Don't fall into the trap this sorry excuse for a person wants you to. It could be anyone.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I would trust over my husband over some blocked number.  But it depends on how much you really trust him.<br>  <br>  Ask him about it and make a decision based on his reaction.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	blocked nember....red flag<br>  why is it blocked.....because the caller has nothing they want the person who blocked them to hear....or because they are just trouble in general<br>  I think the big clue lies in this   :  )|`|4POGapREaa	Did she say his name?  Are you sure she even has the right number?  I just got a call 5 minutes ago from someone who was positive she had an appointment with me.  Wrong numbers happen.  Show him the messages & see what his reaction is.  It could be someone that doesn't like you or doesn't like him.  Who knows?|`|a66nvk0taa	The best thing is to confront him about these messages etc. This will put your mind at ease. On the other hand maybe she knows something you don't know about your husband? I would say shall we show to the police? if he say no just a prank call I would start wondering if this is true about him|`|fMEypXDYaa	Save the text's and when he comes home show them to him, and really listen to what he has to say, then ask to see his cell and see if there are any numbers he can't explain to you? If there is nothing there, then he shouldn't have a problem about doing that, and you need to check and see if the cell company can give you the number, there are codes sent with each text, it's a government thing. I've never heard of that before either., know you can set your cell not to send your number when your using it, but that is new to me.|`|usoBwVsaaa	Confront Him..<br>  Ask him whats going on...<br>  &  Be nice bout it<br>  & tell him if he wants out of the marriage, he can get out with out cheating & behind your back, tell him you cant tolerate it & when hes at work or gone for more than two hours, id pack my bags & stay with a friend, till he Acts like a husband, & if not?   file for divorce.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Do some snooping.  It could be random and very evil and you can't take it 100% seriously.  But the problem is it could be a real warning and now you are worried and have doubts.  I would need to know.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You sound like you're already on track to see this for the BS that it is.
Mq9GSSHhaa	You want to know a secret? A lot of guys really dig short girls. I know this because I have 5 older brothers, all of whom date/married short girls.

Ask if your mom could take you to the mall on a Saturday, maybe she'll let you spend 100 dollars on a few new outfits. The 100 dollars sounds like a lot, but a new iPod or other electronic items cost just as much.<br>  <br>  I've always loved getting new clothes.

First of all.. why would you even think of doing something like this? A fight is a fight.. and the person will still get in trouble regardless of the circumstances of the case.<br>  <br>  Your little "boyfriend" should just squash this situation quickly and quietly, maturely, instead of planning and going about it like a total kid.

It is really bizarre that you want to take this so far. Not to mention your bf is psycho for wanting you to make the other kid hit you what the hell is that about? Do yo have any morals or maturity? Really tell your bf to leave it a lone and ignore the other kid. Just tell him straight out that you aren't listening to him anymore and you don't care what he has to say. WALK AWAY and ignore him. He will leave you alone once he sees he doesn't fire your fuel anymore with hating his guts. Trust me there are bigger issues that are going to be coming your way when you grow up and hopefully become a mature adult. You are going to have to learn how to pick your battles and how to settle them in the real world. The real world isn't, wont, and doesn't tolerate violence. <br>  <br>  Trust me just leave the kid alone, ignore and move on with your life and be happy. <br>  <br>  Best of luck with you 3|`|GqL8VD9aaa	Wow, you have the worst boyfriend ever, don't u?<br>  Letting u get hit?<br>  <br>  but tell tht kid 'he aint go no ballz' or sumthing stupid. lol.<br>  <br>  answer my question!|`|yo9TVOFPaa	Ha...I am the perfect person for this ...ive been to jail for fighting a lot soo...but thats nothing to brag about...:S<br>  <br>  ANYHOW...if hes a guy, its gonna be hard because well guys don't hit gurls, unless this guy is a total b*tch and will hit girls.  But either or...if cops or anyone gets involved it will ALWAYS look better for you because thanks to the old woman are housewives and men are the strong type or whatev...they always look at the woman as the victim, unless the guy is brutaly beaten haha.  Just call him out on things that you know are gonna trigger him, say he has a girl hes like in love with and would do nething for, just talk **** about her....either or you can go for him first, and just say he attacked you.  If its anything like in Canada, the police will belive you because one, girls dont hit guys PERIOD, and if you're fighting for self defense thers no prob, and especially if its just YOU AND HIM there then they will take your word over his.  But if you have a record for fighting, then itll be really tricky.  I got jumped by a bunch of girls before and had a concussion, I phoned the cops and when they called my name on the radio and heard all the assaults ive gotten in the past the cop says are u sure u never jumped them?  And arrested me and i went to jail!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck lol|`|SmFcDx4waa	tell your boyfriend to grow a pair and accept the consequences for fighting.

F4XhOXU0aa	Don't feel bad about it..unless every time he makes fun of you in front of her she doesn't defend u..my best friend is dating a guy who treats me like crap..he calls me names and everything...but every time he does she goes stop it..or apologize..but in your case its ok if their friends..right now..its not really effecting you|`|u9IMNd7Iaa	Uh-oh. I was in this same situation: Only I was in the position of your friend. my best friend used to like this guy who ended up being kind of a jerk to her because he didn't like her back. Now he talks to me instead.<br>  <br>  I think it's natural to feel a little bit hurt by this. But don't get too upset over it: especially If the jerky guy and your friend are actually just talking, like on msn as friends. She's not asking YOU to be friends with him.  You really need to get over your jealousy, insercurity, whateveer, because you can't tell her who to talk to.|`|3sPnI4Skaa	WELL TO A CERTAIN DEGREE U CAN BE MAD, BUT MAYBE YOUR FRIEND LIKES HIM AS BOYFRIEND MATERIAL, N MAYBE SHE JUST REALLY NOT YOUR FRIEND EITHER AT ALL !>?!?!?!?!?!
AGbusTqGaa	Thats really weird, you need to sit down and talk to her.  You need to think really hard though, did you forget a birthday or anniversary or some other important date?|`|leneiWBlaa	woah...  i wouldn't even think off making her jealous she might just shout at you Again just give the same treatment shes giving to you. good luck.;)|`|zxa2fjpyaa	someone is spreading rumors about you =O|`|AA11358695	write her a letter|`|jL9myhmqaa	well u must have done something to make her snap. if not then she is obviously batsh*t crazy|`|89YkHxMUaa	If this was random them yes she is crazy and you have nothing to make up to her.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	ok, she sounds high maintenance. RUN. to say I prefer chocolates, it sounds to me like she wants to see how far you will go. Don't make her jealous, just run. I don't think she is expecting you to leave so do, if you want her back and she likes you she will come running. I think she is testing you to see how far you will go. RUN|`|lY1uPhmMaa	maybe u did something else just take some time to think about it and then apologize because u most likely did something to upset her no matter how small it may seem|`|AA12183955	sounds like shes a nut job...  if she will not reason with you   then "move along", like go out, dont worry about her.  shell eventually either A. dump you (thank god cause she was crazy) or B. apologize and ask you why u havnt spent any time with her|`|5391432c598af97eb451cfd80531a5e3aa	Does she have any reason to suspect you have been cheating or lying to her?  Or it could be her way of saying she's not interested and making herself feel "ok" with it.  Doesn't make sense, but sometimes people don't think rationally when they have emotional decisions to make|`|0d449c620e934cbe25e669b17809e621aa	Then it has to be a misunderstanding ..you have to talk to her not bribe her with gifts...call her..meeet her something must have been up if she called u all that?..Think about it if you really lyke her then go talk to her...otherwise ignore it and move on|`|YBIiEF3Paa	wow you have to ask her what wrong you did!|`|dYRWG3WTaa	what the heck did you even buy her flowers for if you did nothing wrong? she obviously heard something from someone! "you lying back-stabbing GD son of a B***H" does not indicate you were cheating, you're pretty defensive, I think you and she both have different definitions of "cheating" and YOU'RE BUSTED!|`|TD0aaSQQaa	DONT try and make her jealous... she probably already thinks you are cheating. write her an email/facebook message or a letter and tell her that you dont know what she heard or why shes mad, but that you didnt do anything and you love her.|`|CNlfn5Wraa	If you have absolutely no reason at all for her saying that then she has some real issues. The fact that she said she preferred chocolate tells me she does. She should have been grateful for the flowers. I would take a serious look at this relationship.|`|767862fac913cacc2a85deeb280cab44aa	Whatever you do...don't try to make her jealous...that will only cause things to get worse.  Try writing a letter to her explaining how you feel and send it with postage and all through the mail. If you place it in her mailbox then she will most likely see you doing it and she may think you are snooping in her mail.  Or maybe try to lay off of her for a while...girls sometimes need some time to think about what happened and she just may realize how much she hurt your feelings and may end up wanting to make up with you.  If you had lied about her as she had said you did in the quote...you do need to apoligize for what you said. Lies are not a good thing to do if you did lie.  If you do decide to get her a gift...try godiva chocolates b/c those are really good...although they can be on the pricey side.  Or maybe get her a gift card to a spa or to her favorite shopping place.  You have so many choices so please choose wisely:)|`|TjsR0nc4aa	Why have you not learned?    When she asks you if she looks fat in those jeans, for christ's sake do not say yes.    One time I told this girl that I dated that she looked fat in this blouse she was wearing.  She was like, "oh ... you mean P H A T phat, right?"  I said, "oh helll nah ... you really do look fat."  She said, "baby ... quit joking around, it ain't funny".  I was like, "listen up ... ho ... don't make me have to open up a can of whoop-a$$ on your fat-a$$."  She then shot me in the foot with a .44 Ruger.      Learn from my mistake.  Never tell a girl she is fat!|`|ia2kz4qyaa	say i am sorry while kneeling down at her front door, i am very sure she will forgive you|`|5FXnGXuyaa	shes probably guilty for something she did.|`|AA11551690	In order to answer this question with any sense of intelligent, appropriate answer, it would be best to know your age.|`|AA10923738	What?!?!? Ohhhhhh noooooooooooo, not again! I'm not helping you this time. I've not gotten over last time I tried to patch things up and ended up burning my eyebrows off with fireworks!!! If you do decide to make it up to her, DO NOTHING DANGEROUS!!!! Your not marrying her!|`|0BHErTchaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=apok...    go 2 dis site it helped me|`|qpgm8TOraa	Leave her a message, explaining, very gently, that you'd like to talk about the problem so you can never do it again.  Then you'll find out what the H**LL is going on.  DO MAKE HER JEALOUS!! That will make things WORSE.  When you find out what's wrong, then you can decide if she needs prof. help.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Be a man. Kick that door down with a Freddy mask on!|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Go over to her house and pee on her front door.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	you know exactly what you did. If you did nothing, why were you trying to "make it up to her"??    Eat Funyuns.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	If you didn't do anything then why buy her anything? Kick her to the curb and move on.|`|AA10855383	Heh, i told my boyfriend that 2 nights ago. And he IS lying back-stabbing cheater. And he had NOTHING to say about it.    You shouldnt have send her flowers, that makes you look even guiltier.  It looks like you've actually done something and you're just using the flowers to make it up. Wrong move! If i were u i would ave stood up formyself and said that you haven't done a thing.     Im starting to wonder about you, too. Either someone is lying on you, and just trying to break you two up, or you've actually done smoething and you're trying to hide it. Anything you do in the dark will eventualy come out.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Write her a letter and post it through her letter box asking what she is mad about? Tell her that you really want to talk her and really want to know why she is mad because you really do not understand what is wrong with her and you cannot bear to be without her.  See how she reacts.  Good luck :)|`|9F0iuuMYaa	There HAS to be a reason, she wouldn't just do that.|`|UHip02Gxaa	She probably heard about something you did, or supposedly did.  You should investigate this, find out why she's mad, and fix it.  DO NOT MAKE HER JEALOUS.  Seriously?|`|LgOOYyXIaa	hmmm give her some space. im sure u did something to piss her off...dont make her jealous either lol..|`|zwJbUbWMaa	The last thing you need to do is try and make her jealous.  There obviously has been some miscommunication and you need to let her cool off a little bit and then try and find out what she thinks she knows about you.|`|yorfmfiBaa	sounds like the crimon wave has broke.  time to recluse.|`|FKhY6EVAaa	Treat her the best you can regardless of her actions, then you will at least be at peace with yourself.  You cant change her, only she can do that and by you treating her right she will be more willing to change.
4B3n6uUMaa	my boyfriend gave me one, because we both agreed that we're not ready to be engaged right now, but we still wanted a strong sign of commitment. i thought it was the sweetest thing ever. (:|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	I like them I think it is a good way to show your girl that you are going to stick by her through anything|`|8WyQH3RVaa	It is in no way out dated. I think they are a gentle reminder of the promise you have made to each other. <br>  <br>  I think in the position I am in I would get a little freaked if my boyfriend bought me one. But we haven't dated more than 4 months and I am only 15. <br>  <br>  However if I was a little older and in a more serious relationship that has had time to develop over several months of dating then I would think that a promise ring was very sweet.|`|evJ2GEodaa	On me and my boyfriends two year anniversary he gave me a lovely promise ring. Honestly I loved it, but that is just my personal opinion.|`|2c4oLCOqaa	Do It!<br>  It'll make her feel more secure about you wanting to be with her for a long time<br>  <br>  greaaat idea<br>  Loves it!|`|AU4LAtqMaa	super sweet and thoughful.<br>  unless she has other ideas<br>  but i would love it|`|wpd56qtEaa	thats so cute... i would love it .. it shows a guy respects girls and himself|`|8qVkSA4jaa	I think it is very sweet. :) However, if you are ready to get engaged, that's even better. That doesn't mean you have to get married right away.|`|5rzHIe7Faa	yes.<br>  very lame.
UfOP3xtcaa	It is normal to feel  attached to children. But you crave the baby's innocents on an unconscious level. But you can feel as though the baby is your friend.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Um, I'm not sure....well, I guess you guys ARE friends :)  Yeah, its not odd....I mean, normally you would call your best friend somebody of your own age or so....but on the other hand, maybe you are HIS best friend too!|`|IcHmWDSCaa	Do you think it's weird for people to have imaginary friends? It's almost the same thing babies can't talk but I guess there both fun to hang with.|`|aCUTP68xaa	its fine
izXIAxXGaa	Well it all depends. Many times, a child will bond with an aunt or uncle that they think is "cool" and turn away from their parents. I have often turned to my aunt, my mother's younger sister and my godmother. When I was younger alot of guys I went to school with thought my aunt was a MILF (but we did not have a term like that when I was a kid). I certainly did not think of her in that way- she's family. She was very important to me in my life when my mother nearly died, got divorced and remarried. <br>  To answer your question, I think this sister/aunt bonding is a good thing. She is lucky she has an aunt who loves her.
u9IMNd7Iaa	It really depends. I am a girl, some of my friends say that they like "Bad boys" while some say that they like "Good boys."<br>  Doesn't matter which one you are. It doesn't matter If you're covered in tattoos and listen to heavy metal , or If you read poetry and volenteer at an animal shelter... Just be YOURSELF and respect girls. I personally like all types of guys. There is a girl out there for you :)|`|75btdWJkaa	It depends on the girl. I prefer sweet, funny, good guys.|`|jBupmzYaaa	good boys.<br>  they need to understand and care about them, care about there relationship with a girl. Treat her with respect, and don't act like a jerk!|`|qNB0rXXvaa	i would say good... sweet, caring, loving(:
WzAHKILcaa	Wedding Dance is a delightful murder mystery set in 14th century Egypt. The artistry of the language is amazing. As Daguio wrote this story for a 3rd grade english class the intellectual value is limited- though it is suggestive of the evolving revolution in Egypt of the time. His prayers to the sun god make this story full of spiritual value which leads to great permanance. It has immense universiality as anyone can related to his trials in discovering who murdered the great Xionsa Managua. Though the style is primative it makes this story easy to read. . . .    OH YEAH AND LEARN TO DO YOUR OWN SCHOOLWORK!!!!!
wy25UY33aa	how old are you 10 <br>  <br>  your mom is right<br>  <br>  wait till your 18|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Until your 18, you have to stick with your parent's decision. Also, even if you love your boyfriend now, what will happen if you break up? Tattoos are permanent. But if you really feel like you need it, just keep asking your mom.|`|F47MyGDSaa	Okay, I realize you probably love your boyfriend a lot, and think that you'll last forever, but I'm assuming you're under 18. And if I were you, wait, wait, wait! Are you sure you want some guy's name tattooed on your permanetly? What if you guys break up? What if something happens in the relationship?<br>  <br>  If you're really determined, then get the infinity symbol, and if you guys are still together in years, then go ahead and get his name.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	Wait until you are old enough to go get a tattoo without a parent's permission. Who knows, by that time, you and Richard may decide you don't want it, or you may not even be together then. So, don't be in a rush. Your mom is right, and you are still too young to do it without her permission, so wait. If you still want it then, go for it.|`|6Rt9aM8daa	Well of course you sound determined, but what happens when you two break up and you absolutely hate him now? The last thing you would want is his name on your neck. So you cannot live with swtching back and forth to being Bf and Gf for long. If this tattoo is just for your boyfriend, it is not worth your money or time.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	here is what you do... wait until you are older and can pay for it,,, just like your mom told you!!!!!!!!!|`|hDPtaQwWaa	I think you should wait until you're older. When I was younger I was obsessed with getting tattoos and when I turned 18 I got them. When I look at them they seem so horrible now. You are not the person now that you will be in 10, 20, or 30 years. Yes, you can cover them up someday if you break up but it will always say Richard underneath the ink.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Listen to your mother. Wait for it. This is, what, your third boyfriend this week? He's not gonna last forever with you. <br>  <br>  Wait before you make an impulsive decision. That's what most people should do before they ruin their lives, not after.|`|xjZNnFLtaa	You want it, you want it , you want it, right?<br>  <br>  That is a child's reaction, so you have proved your mother is right.  You are too young.|`|Hx2raTNQaa	you know u might not be together 4ever so dont get it ur momma has here reasons deal with it!
4NSp9wNiaa	The final straw, according to you: you had anger toward your step-child: "(I) took (it) out on my wife, and to a lesser extent, my children..." and now you're sorry.  You cite this example as THE instance in your relationship with her that figuratively "broke" the camels back...<br>  <br>  Yet, for the past year, your wife has indicated to you there was previous bad behavior from you that was completely unacceptable.  <br>  <br>  Are you sorry for your past behavior?  Have you done anything to adjust your anger response?  Or are you just very, very sorry that you must now account for that behavior?<br>  <br>  The best indicator of future behavior is past behavior.  For a wife to up and move out with three kids, and to go it alone, it must have been pretty F'ed up in that household.  Sounds like she's taken off her rose-colored glasses; you might try doing the same...|`|a66nvk0taa	Looks like you blew David. To little to late by the looks of it|`|D3hYbsVJaa	This is going to be a bit drastic, but hear me out. Call her bluff. Tell her you want a divorce, because now SHE isn't changing. I can't tell you which way she will react, but if she's willing to try, there's a chance. If not, and you really have made changes, you don't deserve to be made to live like that. Her daughter was her problem to deal with, and it sounds like she didn't, and you were left holding the responsibility.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Unfortunately, when someone says that nothing can be done to fix a marriage, said marriage is dead. The best you can do is to keep a good, loving relationship with your children and move on with your personal life. Sorry, my friend, but once a woman's heart goes that cold there's generally no warming it back up. Good luck to you.|`|8j7zj9aKaa	How do you undo - you and your wife agree that you cant.<br>  Your wife asserts that what you did - compromised her ability to love or trust you - a very likely possibility.<br>  <br>  What you need is a vision beyond what you or your wife can currently see.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read three books.  They are amazing.  From them you then should build a tool-kit and spend a few years winning back your wife's heart.  If there is any love left in there - then with good faith effort these will maximize your chance of restoring your relationship:<br>  - his needs her needs <br>  - how to fight for your marriage<br>  - the five love languages<br>  <br>  There is a truth - nobody can become deaf to their built-in languages of love, and heart-deep felt needs.  Nobody living in a vacuum can turn off their hard-wired channels for communicating and recieving value in a relationship.  When you kill the 4 relationship-killers in your relationship, and you really (really really) learn to communicate effectively (called effective mid-fight conflict resolution and negotiation techniques) then your relationship gets a lot better chance of survival.|`|g3HrRmaCaa	Man i understand you love her, and want her back. But it seems like she's just messing with you. Seems like shes one of those grudge holding women. By her not getting back with you, she has you begging, and she likes that. Also she hasnt filed for divorce, so she's making you feel like there is still hope when there is none. Dude, file for divorce and go on bout your business before you go crazy.
1YdeUn1Caa	He has no intentions of leaving his wife. Not only does he cheat but he lies too. Get use it. He doesn't want to pay a ton of alimony. Adulterers usually do. Tough break. Yeah right.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	If he does get a divorce, and that's a big IF, what do you think he'll end up doing to you. Once a cheater always a cheater. Run Run as fast as you can.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Now who is a Christian in this scenario?  You need to find the Lord and to do his will.  So start going towards God before you end up in hell!|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Where do you live that the this hasn't turned over already? Even if she doesn't sign, there is still a time limit that she has to sign. She cannot stop the divorce, she can only contest the conditions of the divorce, which she has limited amount of time to do. He needs to see an attorney.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	LMAO.  You fell for the oldest line in the book.  What a stupid sl-t.  He's not going to divorce his wife.  To do so would be stupid. He's loose half of everything.  Face it you are nothing but the whore on the side.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Big deal.  So you popped out his bastard.  Still doesn't make your relationship or that child legitimate.|`|I814g6ZBaa	You really shouldn't have much of anything to say about this... it's THEIR deal to work out, Sweetie.  If he has a lawyer let them handle her.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	You are cheating with a married man.  That is what I think.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	In all fairness, she has a bit of a right to be a miserable person with the current situation. <br>  That aside, most states allow default divorces where the other spouses signature is not required. However if she is contesting the divorce, that is different than just not signing the papers. He will have to get a lawyer to get a contested divorce finalized.|`|g6n3OnmSaa	I'm pretty sure you don't need both people to agree to a divorce to get one.  And I'm almost positive that it wouldn't take three years to get a divorce, even if it's contested.  I think the others are right.  He's probably lying to both of you.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	The slimy worm can take his dirty little unpaid whore by the hand and lead her to the nearest cliff so they can jump off together.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I think that's what he's telling you so he has an excuse for not getting  divorced.<br>  <br>  I think he's not leaving his wife.|`|VygBNA0Waa	ask a lawyer and say that she wont sign and you and him want to get married it might have to go to court|`|acToOsxjaa	Why are you with a married man. Respect marriage so people will respect you in yours when you are in one.|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	edit your question......are they legally seperated?..to me it sounds like your the other woman|`|AA11208683	well this is a sticky situation. i would say talk to someone (like a lawyer) and tell them the situation and see what he says. GOOD LUCK!
5V5L9DoBaa	talk about anything.<br>  to be honest its always the guy's job to do the impressing and if you go about trying to impress him then he's going to think there's a reason he shouldnt be with you because if you lack confidence in yourself, why should someone else be confident in you being a good girlfriend?? do you get what i'm saying<br>  <br>  just be yourself really; it sounds cliche but it's something you get to learn with experience. can you really live the rest of your relationship in a web of lies you made about yourself??|`|WcUuH7i3aa	wear something cute but not like  trampy some guys like that but not all! and talk about something u have in commen  hope i can help :D|`|VfFB5wSJaa	If its friendlys dress casually. jeans and a cute shirt. Wear natural makeup cost if you cake makeup on, most guys will say its a turn off. Don't do anything stupid, like squeal to get his attention. As corny as it is, Be Yourself, cuz in reality you wouln't want to be a fake just to go out with this guy. Strike casual conversation with him, maybe crack a couple of jokes. Be flirty, but don't overdue it. GOOD LUCK!|`|tuendbBeaa	you act completely normal, wear something a little sexy, but not skanky. Remember, you're interested in him, and you want him to be interested in you.<br>  <br>  You're most likely not interested in his penis, just as you most likely don't want him to be interested in only your boobs.<br>  That being said...<br>  <br>  Make a little flirtatious eye contact, Talk about whatever you feel comfortable talking about, and be yourself! Nothin worse then trying to be fake... more of a turn off then a turn on..<br>  <br>  And if he doesn't get the hint by the end of the night, don't play games! walk up to him and say, hey, i think you're cool, we should hang out sometime... or some other, not-as-cheesy remark.<br>  <br>  May I ask for an answer, if you can?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoJ.xq.nZkCk8KwHydIqiQnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219175851AAbzUNq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|CkGFICf9aa	wear whatever makes you feel good and keep the conversation fun and positive.|`|Y6jOPMboaa	You wear something sexy.|`|GfKO5vuVaa	Just be yourself, wear what you like, but atleast make yourself look decent! Like jeans and a nice top, because I think guys find it annoying when girls try too hard to impress them. <br>  As for what to talk about? Just ask him about his interests, what music he likes, his hobby's, and try to find something in common with him. Then you could be talking for hours :).
aipChC3haa	Listen here sweetie, that girl "anna" and "jeremy" are PISSING ME OFF!<br>  What they did is TOTALLY unforgivable, so what I think you should do is go tell them off.<br>  Right to there face, tell them "You guys f'ed this sh1t up 4 me, so I don't want you guys in my wedding, and if you guys don't stop stalking me, I'm gonna sue you."<br>  Trust me, threatening them legally will DEFINITELY get them to back off.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry about all that drama.<br>  Hope your wedding still goes well =)<br>  <br>  And yeah, don't feel sorry for them!<br>  Think about what they did to you!<br>  It was unforgivable!<br>  Remember this is your big day, so think about what  makes YOU and your fiancee happy, not those backstabbers.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING... i would NEVER let them back... its better this way then you can have your wedding with out more drama that you dont need (weddings have enough drama by them selves with out dumb people getting involved)...|`|cYa5blUJaa	in short i would tell them to stick it its your day not theirs you do whats best for you and your fiance|`|ohJtvKd5aa	WOW! What a situation! I think you are perfectly fair in not allowing them back into your wedding party. The shenanigans they were playing show you that they are NOT your friends and therefore should NOT be standing beside you on YOU and YOUR fiances big day. They've brought all of this drama and the wedding day hasn't even arrived; think about what they could do on the actual wedding day? Not a good thought!<br>  ~Remember that the members in your wedding party are those that will support you and encourage your marriage not bring it down~|`|ALQFHnHTaa	You're right. Fiance if right. Some friends! Guess you are glad they won't be your friends anymore. If not....let them back. It's your call.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Tell the lying twits Anna and Jeremy to F**K off.

No you're not wrong and don't let your mom pressure you to put anyone into the wedding that you don't want. Its your wedding, not hers. Don't feel bad about it anymore, just go on with your life. Even if they hadn't done this sick thing, you shouldn't put anyone in your wedding that you don't want. Its your wedding, you should have it the way that you want to and with the people that you want there.
ReNmXYiKaa	I am also a very shy person, I really didn't have any friends at the start of my high school year because my best friend, who was my neighbor, moved away.  He was basically my only friend for 6 years, and he left.  So going into high school I went out of my comfort zone and sat with some kids that looked nice and people that I recognized, but never talked to.  I got comfortable with them and became friends.  My brother told me once that once you make a friend you usually become friends with their friends, which is exactly happened to me and I didn't even realize it at first.<br>     <br>  This won't be easy if you are shy, I am shy and I'm trying to change and become a more outgoing person.  You have to force yourself to talk.  <br>  <br>     And I am sure that you are a very likable person, but you are just shy.  If you just talk to people, most people will talk back.  Just don't get discouraged and try to keep you mind off things sad.  To keep my mind of problems I usually play the drums or guitar, or play with my dogs.  <br>  <br>     Even if you only make a few good friends, that's all you really need, friends that you can count on and care for you. <br>  <br>     I don't think that you have depression like the others say, I have also felt sad and lonely because I had no friends after my best friend left.  <br>  <br>     Don't get discouraged, you will get through this part of your life and you will get out of your shell and make friends, and bf if you want to.<br>  <br>     And as far as your grades go, if you need help with school work or studying just stay after school and go over things with a teacher, all you have to is ask that teacher when they stay after school and they will help you. <br>  <br>  "When we are motivated by goals that have deep meaning, by dreams that need completion, by pure love that needs expressing, then we truly live life."<br>  -Greg Anderson|`|4VufpFTZaa	You probably need someone to hang with you, you could try talking to your brother once in a while.<br>  Or try to make some new friends at school and people who like you and would like to spend time with you and hang with you...<br>  People to be around you when you need them.<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps :) Best of luck.|`|7ef8045cf8b357bf19390fb7c3a5caf4aa	Ok first and most important, your life is young.  You are only 15 and you have time to change.  Listen to me now, the best advice I can give is to not waste a moment.  I let so many opportunities pass me by and now I look back and have all these regrets about things I could have done.<br>  <br>  Now, I think you should start emailing your brother and sharing your lives.  The internet is a great way to keep in touch with him.  Find out about his life and share yours with him.<br>  <br>  Forget about being shy.  I know that sounds stupid and to me it even sounds hypocritical because I am about as shy as you can get, but try something new.  Be brave and get out there and you would be surprised at what could happen.  And so what if there are stumbling blocks along the way?  At least down the road you can say you did something with your life.|`|BGAOI8mQaa	Depression is a terrible thing and should be dealth with. I have this to say to you, being depressed is one sure way to destroy yourself. Noone in this world has the responsibility to make you happy. Its actually you that should make yourself happy. Try looking at youself in the mirror and start laughing. secondly, try loving yourself by that i mean you don't do things that make you sad but look for things that don't like calling your brother. You are young and dynamic. You are the best noone is better than you because noone has the same finger print as you. Try to understand that you were made for a purpose and that purpose is to bring an answer to the cry of many. you are a great person if you can only look within you. Talk more to boys if it helps you but remember you are born for the top. Don't allow anyone talk you down because you are a great and mighty person. Believe in yourself and God and all will be alright. Believing in yourself helps you build your self-esteem. Remember, there's an angel stored in that stone. there's a seed of greatness in you don't kill it but let it out.take charge.|`|HV1UIaSQaa	Nothings wrong with you, you just miss the life that you used to have. I've been in your situation before. You just need to meet new people, yeah I know it's kind of hard, but if you want to get out of the rough spot in life your going to need to make new memories. Try to keep in touch with some of your old friends too.<br>  <br>  For advice or some counseling send questions or emails to:<br>  goodnewsforpeoplewholovebadnews@live.c...<br>  <br>  they'll give you reassurance if you're ever feeling down or help you out with a problem and you won't have to wait more than two days for a reply message.|`|LbipT3yIaa	honey your in the stage of depression and dont ever think of susicdal thoughts that will make you feel worst<br>  <br>  <br>  try a counsuler or a theryaps|`|4PxdEfo6aa	well i guess finding friends on yahoo works! try finding some1 on yahoo answers who had an answer you liked and email them. life sucks, but hang in there. you might get somewhere!|`|fHJcGAyTaa	get  puppy, seriously, Im not kidding.

Get some help from your parents and tell them what's going on, they can really help you with your problem.  If that doesn't work go see a school counselor at school or some other adult that you trust to help you with this.  Just brighten up because there's ALWAYS someone there to help you out in your time of need.  You just have to make the first move.  If you want someone to talk to go ahead and email me at emily_wltn@hotmail.com :D

sFASHCNRaa	don't do anything, keep acting like you would normally act around him. and when the time comes (if it comes) when he asks you out, just calmly and firmly tell him you think its so sweet of him, but you only see him as a friend and you just want to remain friends.<br>  <br>  i mean seriously just because a guy likes you doesn't mean you should change the way you act around him. right?|`|k8HVgVdnaa	he likes you but you don't like him. tell him that and maybe he will understand you. and he migth even lay off|`|JeDf5o39aa	You just gotta lay it down and let him kno that you don't want to ruin your friendship or something of the sort.

mcUSz16kaa	How more affectionate do you want her to be?  You should tell her how you feel, and just talk to her about it.   Initiate your affection for her first if you are not doing it. You might be surprised.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Be honest, is this about pure affection?  Or is it about sex?  Desire?  Frequency?  Because every woman I have ever seen who is "hot" for her man, has a hard time keeping her hands off him.  They constantly touch you when they are into you.  And it is very, very nice.  <br>  <br>  Have you had children yet?  If not, be careful this will get worse after kids.  Most women who act like this become MORE like this after having kids.|`|8G42oyydaa	Exactly what is your definition of affection if it isnt touching, hugging, holding hands and kissing? Sexual intercourse in public?  <br>  <br>  Dont make the mistake a lot of men make thinking they can read their wife's minds and whatever they are thinking is always negative, in my experience these mind readers are almost always 100% wrong.<br>  <br>  If it aint broke why think it needs fixing?|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	She may be the type who is not 'touchy' 'feely'.  I have a sister and a daughter like that.  You should accept and be thankful for what she does for you (holding hands and kissing) because it is out of love for you.  Also, everyone has a different comfort level and need for touch.  Hers seems to be low.  You say you get along and she seems happy.  Rejoice in what you do have!|`|2CZ3W65laa	My hubby had an affair. This solved my lack of affection toward him. We survived the trauma even  though the pain was debilitating, Now, I won't keep my hands off him--I meet all his needs and more. I am so grateful to get to touch him every day and I let him know this with my hands. Tell her that men will get their needs met elsewhere if not at home and it hurts like hell.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Talk to her a bit about it. Come onto her. Go to the store and buy things that will maybe spice things up. Make sure she's happy all together =]|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Maybe she is affectionate - just not to you.|`|ocLPEMsZaa	Talk to her, maybe she has something bothering her that you should talk about. She doesn't seem happy, or maybe she wasn't brought up with a lot of affection. I know that people I've known who have been raised with little affection it takes a long time to learn. Counseling may be an option, but I'm not sure it's quite at that point. Try talking to her and learning what the route is. If you've been married for four years has it always been that way? Did something happen? Talk to her and if you both get along great, she should be willing to open up to you.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The two of you need to get the book "The five love languages" and read it together.  It helps us understand that people feel loved in different ways.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are a physical touch person.  I am too.  Luckily my husband is as well, which means we didn't have a problem in this area.  <br>  <br>  Your wife might be a different love language.  She may feel love by acts of service, gifts, words of affirmation, or quality time.  <br>  <br>  We don't always understand that our spouse may feel love in a different way than us, so we show love in our love language, and our spouse feels unloved.|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	I too have been married for 4 years.  I used to be very affectionate with my husband, but life started crowding in and I just honestly didn't realize that we were not the way we used to be.  I suggest sitting her down and telling her how you feel.  Maybe she just doesn't realize how you are feeling.  If you want one thing that helped my marriage was the movie Fireproof.  The movie just made things better all the way around even though we got along well it made me more Thankful|`|pOTigVYPaa	First of all, tell your wife how  much you love her.  Then tell her how much it means to you to receive affection from her.  Ask her if there is anything you could do to encourage her to be more affectionate towards you.  If she responds  negatively, then ask her to see a doctor and get herself checked for any physical causes.  Please be patient with her.|`|zHJufZTcaa	When you find the answer to this age long question... fill the rest of us guys in. I have been married 10yrs, and I feel your pain.

Yet we still keep letting them eat it..|`|brkvK1Teaa	When it comes time to be intimate, you need to spice it up.  That will change her in ways you've never seen before.

x02jsjg6aa	It's natural to want to feel that your mate is securely with you, so it's very hard to control it.  The only way to deal with it is to get involved with someone who 1) is not a flirter, and 2) is willing to modify their life to keep your jealousy under control.<br>  <br>  Yes, you are responsible for your own emotions.  But you're also responsible for finding a man who isn't a huge flirt, and doesn't have tons of close single female friends.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Yeah, you can.  My wife had an affair once, and the emotions that run through you are pretty intense.  The key for me was to just stay strong and have faith in myself first, and kinda know that no matter what happens, I'll be okay.  If you need someone else to make you happy, you get possessive and jealous and angry.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Go get your hair done really cute, Get your nails done, Get new shoes, Buy new clothes. Look really cute and you'll notice all the girls & guys starring at you, It will take away that jealous a bit.|`|x3EPqezJaa	If you have such strong feelings, then they must come from a deep psychological issue. You need to see a therapist to manage and heal your feelings of jealousy.|`|c7951ec8493247735098be6889c642f0aa	No , jealousy is  not a feeling that can be controlled it comes as part of the human condition or animal condition to survive ....  to find a mate etc ... you can however identify the preliminary emotions such as , feeling rejected ... and deal with the jealousy before they appear, usually you can effectively explain why you are reacting to rejection , like being honest and saying that's not fair , or I can not deal with that ... if you don't get results at that point and you are right back to where your jealousy or the other is jealous than you have to take precautions to change , the relationship. via counseling, or change to celibacy kind of like saving your money ) and there is also dating others ...|`|aDhZIhQcaa	If you are that jealous and insecure, you need to learn to love yourself, by yourself and for yourself.  Jealousy comes from you lacking something inside of yourself that you see another person has, and you want it for yourself.  Self confidence is something learned not something you are born with.  You also need to believe in yourself and accept yourself, warts and all, faults and all.  Where I live, a woman has to be fat, ugly, and stupid with no personality to fit in this town.  And I have realized that is what goes on around the world.  Women who have it together are very ostracized and are very lonely.  And as the saying goes, misery loves company.  And birds of a feather flock together.  So jealous, insecure people always have friends of like minds.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Jealousy is within you.  It's your insecurities taking over.  People who feel secure don't get jealous (unless they're feeling insecure).  I find the best way to get through those feelings is by acknowledging them, "This is jealousy I'm feeling".  Once they're there, it's important to objectively analyze why you're having those feelings.  Through practice, you can learn to stop the feelings in their tracks before they eat you alive.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	Here's how I think about it...if the other person is going to cheat, they're going to cheat, then you leave.  You find someone new.  If you act crazy, they're going to leave, anyway.  You have to reason in your own mind.  Most people do get cheated at some point.  Not every relationship works out forever.  If it doesn't work, that's just an experience you learn from.  It seriously is only a big deal if you make it a big deal.|`|7DoR1QKuaa	I'm not sure if you are a spiritual person, but it seems like you have a stronghold.  Pray about it!  PUSH...  Pray Until Something Happens<br>  <br>  Be Blessed!|`|zTBscfuraa	yuu just have to gae over it becuz i dnt think yuu will get a grl like that and if yuu do it probly wont work im sorry but sum girls liike yuu to b jelous other girls not so much so idk get a consler|`|HmWSssa7aa	i prefer and will stay single for life there's no jealousy involved here|`|4POGapREaa	Past experience & the type of people you involve yourself with can definitely change your attitude.  I had nothing but complete sh!t men in my life so obviously I didn't have the highest expectations going into a relationship.  But at some point you need to take responsibility for your poor choices & stop blaming others.  Maybe you're just not ready to do that & be happy.  If you know you're a train wreck with relationships & you're going to do more harm than good, then stay away from it for a while until you resolve the issues you have.  I did that.  I was celibate for 5 yrs because I knew I wasn't healthy & didn't want to make someone else just as miserable as I was.  Once I recognized my own flaws & contributions to crappy relationships, I was ready to be a normal person & open myself up to caring for someone else without judgment.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	The thing about jealousy is that it stems from feelings of fear and insecurity.  The way you "control" it is to let go of your desire to control.<br>  <br>  This jealousy is an indicator of an internal problem you've got with security and trust.  That's what you need to work on.

Want to go to the prom with me!?<br>  <br>  Geez guys think girls need tons of cool stuff like limos and jewelry. If she likes you she'll go if she doesnt she wont. Its not hard.|`|b2j5AE1oaa	here's something you two should hang out see what she's like and then she'll see what your like but just act cool so she doesn't get freaked out and think what went wrong|`|DOvkpvmoaa	simply just ask her but it wouldn't hurt to strike a conversation first and maybe get her number.
1YdeUn1Caa	It all depends why they are separated. <br>  Did one cheat on the other? Is one violent? Alcoholic? Just can't stand the sight of each other? Only they know.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	Only your parents can answer that question.  I know it is confusing and hard but hang in there.|`|7586a5fb518ea697aa3522e5672f338daa	If both still love each other(4real), then i'm sure things'll work out. don't worry. my parents r divorced too. ur situation isn't bad(at all, really).|`|Aa9EFuQYaa	your parents situation is similar to my parent they've been together for like 22 years and they constantly fight they were fighting even before i was born so im used to it i know that some day they my love each other again but not in the husband and wife kind of way but in the best friend kind of way cause thats what they are same thing with your parents maybe theyre just better off being friends rather than partners.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	The odds are 50/50.  But I hope so.<br>  <br>  20 years is a long time to dedicate yourself to someone only ot have it end.<br>  <br>  The thing is, it is really up to them.  It has nothing to do with you.  So, you didn't cause this situation and there isn't anything you can do to fix it.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	welll if theyve been together for 19 years, then i think they'll make up.|`|6mJJrVUlaa	It's possible but I wouldn't get your hopes up.  You never know what the future holds, they might, and they might not.  Either way you will still have a family that loves you :D|`|rMJ0hsNWaa	I dont think they will not to be mean but they will still be friends!!
UHWPNLOzaa	I don't think that us women have better memories than men we just place importance on different things then men do.  We can be heading to the most important place in our life and run into three different people and a year later remember who they were and when they were going on that day but at the same time if one of them was a man chances are he would have forgotten meeting me until I being the woman jogged his memory.  It's not that we remember more we just focus more on our surrondings, people, places, thts why it takes us so long to get ready to go anywhere. lol|`|LSCG8aGVaa	uh maybe your just HOTT !|`|jfiF9XIUaa	Some people have photogenic memory and some people have to actually hold a conversation with someone at some point to remember who they are. You will be amazed at how many people have just walked by you and you think they werent looking at you but they were.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Girls remember things differently then guys do. We pay close attention to small details that catch our eye and we remember then for along time. Maybe those girls found something about you interesting. Or maybe you just have a face that is memorable;)|`|JNCpyyYZaa	hell no, I honestly think the hot ones collect numbers. especially at parties and what not.

When it comes to names I suck though lol.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	I think yours is just really bad. I'm a guy, and I'm capable of the same thing.

E7TkNO00aa	Talk to your mom and let her know that you heard everything that was going on in the bathroom and that you deserve to be treated with respect. She is the adult, but she has to be a mother first. Good luck and don't be sad. Maybe your mom will understand and not do it again.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	talk about overreacting!!!  stop with the silly baby reactions.  what they do behind closed doors is none of your business.<br>  <br>  why were you crying?  you are not two years old.|`|7Fc22teCaa	You have my condolences for the discomfort you must be going through. This is no doubt a very tough thing for you at your age. Sharing your mothers attention with this new person will be the toughest, but remember that your mother loves you and if she knew you had been close enough to hear, this wouldn't have happened.<br>  A good start is needed for your future step dad, take things slowly.<br>  If this man respects and loves your mom, he will not try to take your real dads place, but be your friend and mentor. Good luck.|`|gLno6BNZaa	tell your mom how you feel,she is your mother.Tell your mother that you dont want too see that,and no  your mom does not to be locked up!!!! dont hate your mom,just tell her how you feel,maybe your mom doesnt realize that this hurts you??dont hate your mom ,tell her mom ,these things i see or hear i dont like,maybe she will know better to not to do that around you anymore ,if she continues that call the childrens help line in your area,or telll someone,like your teacher or counsellor at school,things will get better:)|`|lgM3xZkWaa	Just tell her not to fool around when your like right there.Tell her boyfriend to respect that your not used to him and to stop fooling around when it still daylight.|`|KqhpV614aa	tell ur mom how u feel about him.  just tell her u hate and ur more important then some man|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	That is always awkward.  Try not to think about it, and if you think it will make you feel better to talk to her in the morning then give it a shot.  I don't know how your relationship is with her but from my personal experience sometimes its easier to not say anything because that could be very uncomfortable for all of you for a while.|`|Sm44fi0jaa	hey sit down and talk to your mom about it. tell her how you feel. talk to her boyfriend too. i think they will understand|`|A8CuNgV2aa	Tell your mom how you feel.

vHB9zUcCaa	so-called 'friends' like that r not worth it. u deserve far better. if i were u i'd move on & let God heal yer heart. meanwhile, 4-give her, but never again allow yerself 2 B in that position|`|hvcjyEmDaa	No, it is time to move on. True friends don't burn you.|`|xs5J6VJTaa	You should NOT be friends with this person. You deserve to have friends who will not treat you this way. Her behaviour is cruel and immature. <br>  Don't put anymore effort into this friendship, she does not deserve it. Just because people are popular does not mean they are good people. It is better to have one or two genuine friends, popular or not than to have dozens of friends who are false or fake.<br>  Don't let people take advantage or walk all over you. You will be happier without her.|`|amKkfPS2aa	This girl is NOT acting like a friend right now, no matter how close you guys have been before, people change. She doesn't know what a real friend truly is, so leave her and make new (loyal!) friends of your own, and when she realizes her huge mistake she'll come running back to you. It's up to you whether or not you accept.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	NO. Best friends always become strangers. Just be there for her when the popular girls ditch her.|`|110635f4fe1d99bd90ec9718bf3e33d5aa	how can you call her "best friend"? the answer is pretty obvious|`|18Gznv50aa	I don't think you should keep trying. If you were really as good of friends as you say you were she would apologize for insulting you. And if you already made an effort to talk to her and she hasn't responded you can't really do anything. you can only meet her half way.|`|ktwKE36Yaa	sometimes people do not know how to respond to other people and when they are around others they front,  talk to her when she is by herself, try one more time if nothing, then her lost not yours
L30nc3wsaa	If you were a true Christian you wouldn't be making hurtful comments like that. If you're going to ask why God made such an ugly person you should ask yourself that very same question. Why did God make you so ugly on the inside? You're being really rude to someone who is being polite to you. It'll all come back to you though. Karma is a *****.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	You may SAY you are a Christian, but the way you are speaking about your classmate definitely does not come off Christian like<br>  <br>  Work on walking the walk and not just talking the talk.<br>  <br>  <br>  And there is a good chance you are not as attractive as you may think, people may look at you and ask if God was having a bad day when he made you.<br>  <br>  Karma is cruel.|`|APDvOr4naa	lmao -points and laughs-<br>  you are so mean, and i agree god obviously made cruel people<br>  -points at you- <br>  now because you say this, your kids will be ugly.<br>  >.< you are so rude why are you mean to someone who's being nice to you? your ugly from the inside! (probably from outside too)<br>  haha. oh p.s looks dont last forever, so when you grow up<br>  i bet you will look like a ugly muthafudger, :)|`|YOGPspsgaa	And maybe you're just jealous of her for some reason? Get a life you snob.|`|AA11098291	big lips is sexy....|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	What's cooler Jesus or Jesus with a robotic arm? Just curious.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	just admit you are secretly in love with her|`|VygBNA0Waa	i think that you are in love with her but to scared to say it<br>  if you really do call her ugly to her face then i hope something happens to you so your even uglier than her and everyone sits around and points at you and say ugly bastard <br>  you are so mean and cruel <br>  your nasty <br>  your horrible<br>  your weird <br>  your in love with her<br>  i hope someone is as nasty as you is that nasty to you|`|KJYNkp4Xaa	God put people on Earth like that so you can like them for their personality, not their looks. But people like YOU need to quit hating, and get a life. Because you are blind and can't see past looks because you are so shallow!|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	and you said you're a christian. by saying that you just mock God's creation. and God's creation is perfect. it's human like you who messed up.|`|ZfAiUNvHaa	God also obviously made cruel people. -coughcough-|`|8rXaN6F6aa	There is no god. <br>  <br>  But if you choose to delude yourself with theism.. god created ugly people to motivate them. When people get made fun of.. it motivates them to be better people.|`|DI8m0wXPaa	Get a life|`|JZMfUDylaa	anata wa baka desu!|`|vTra7n5baa	First off, this girl has her looks because of genetics and various mutations.  I doubt any divine power drew a sketch of her as she was developing in the womb.  Second, I have the following requirements for what I consider ugly:<br>  <br>  1) Talking negatively about others<br>  2) Judging on appearance and labels only.<br>  3) Being offensive and opportunistic.<br>  4) Using poor language skills to communicate.<br>  5) Not following the tenets of your own beliefs.<br>  6) Insulting another family when you've never met them.<br>  7) Considering physical features of another ethnic group inferior.<br>  <br>  So based on these requirements, I can't say if god is cruel, but I can say that you are the one who is ugly above all else.  And I would venture to say that you are VERY ugly too.|`|wuM15a5iaa	Your a Christian? I  don't think so. You are being really cruel to that girl. I  would be on the side of the people that say she looks unique and exotic. What is your problem with people who aren't supermodels? you must think your gorgeous. I  would hate to be around when you are waiting to get into heaven and God says "depart I  never knew you"|`|VYaWWglFaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Fw78upNjaa	If a guy likes you, he'll make extra effort. Stop worrying. <br>  <br>  If he's gonna go after you, he will. The signs are there, so flirt and have fun with him. <br>  <br>  The biggest mistake girls make is over-analyzing actions and trying to solve mixed signals. <br>  <br>  It's tough not to know (I call it sweet torture), but in the end it's worth it.<br>  <br>  I totally like this guy and told him about my crush. It's not bad to do, but it takes away that mysterious affect the flirting phase has. I feel like I ruined something that could have been good because I didn't give him time to make a friendship grow :(<br>  <br>  My point is take your time. Let things happen naturally, and he'll come for you.|`|DOvkpvmoaa	it sounds like he likes you to me!

Depression can make people do and say strange things.|`|DytsjZKpaa	marty, you know who i am and i read your last letter that you wrote on here. the only reason that it is over between you and lee is because you thought that you had him by the balls and he finally couldn't take it any longer. he begged you to leave your husband but you put him on the back burner and didn't care for his feelings any longer. now that he is with candy, all of a sudden, you are in lala land. you could of had a great relationship with lee. he adored everything you did but that wasn't enough. you threw your husband up in his face. you lied to him, telling him that you and your husband was over but yet, you would not make that final commitment to leave him. lee stood by you all the way and he was the one that got all the hurt in the end. he still talks about you when he can. i haven't told him about your letter on here nor will i. if you really do love him, you will set him free and let him carry on with his new love but not the love of his life. that is you and he will never forget you but he knows that you will never leave your husband and he must move on.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Keep telling yourself you did the right thing.

I'm sure that is a lot to hear because it sounds like you have tried to convince yourself that you are over him.  But if you still feel the pain when you guys ignore each other then you may not be completely over him.  But it is over and it is a good thing that you realize that so that you can move on.  Keep doing what you're doing and try to not even go to the places where you see him, unless of course it is at work.  Good luck, and I'm sure at some point the pain will completely subside.  Everything will work out.

If your boyfriend already laid a hand on you, chances are, he'll do it again because you let him do it. You would've called the cops on him in the first place. If you are getting along and being flirty with your friend, go for it. Your happiness comes first. Let your boyfriend know that you have kicked him to the curb. That way there will be no misunderstandings. If he knows how bad your bf treats you, tell him to help you get out of that abusive relationship. You don't need someone like that in your life. Good luck.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Leave him, he hit you. Leave him.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	Leave.  It doesn't matter about the other guy right now.  You need to get away from your boyfriend.  If he loved you, he wouldn't hit you.  Let him call, you can change your number.  Tell your parents, go to the police.  Don't get trapped with him.  Get out while you can.  Things will get better, you deserve better.  I got trapped for 5 years and it was a waste of what should have been a good time in my life.  Don't let some guy waste yours.|`|EyUkqMTiaa	Leave him, don't be naive. When a guy hits you it shows that he could become very violent & that he doesnt respect you. I really do THI k you deserve better, and for a guy to hit you, it should be over right away. And having this guy friend will help the situation. My advice, break up with ur bf and don't go back to him, try it out with this guy friend who will respect you and can't start fresh with.<br>  <br>  Really hope you take the advice & good luck!

You need to get away from him.  He is not good for you.  Even if he calls a millions times there is no reason to be with him... I am not sure how old you are but if you still live with your parents you need to tell them what is going on, about how he hit you and tell them that you need to get out of the relationship.  They should be able to help you.  If you dont still live with them you need to file a restraining order and have a friend stay with you for a little while.  Even if it is your new guy friend.  Have some one stay with you so that you can make sure you are safe until your bf of two years learns to back off..<br>  <br>  <br>  It may be hard but you need to get away from the guy that hits you, because what if you have eventually have kids?? Would you really want him to beat on your kids??  Step up and move on honey!! You deserve so much better, and it seems like you may have found that already. So go ahead move on with your life, and enjoy a relationship that isnt violent!!|`|JYQ6M5xmaa	you definitellyy need to tell your so-called abusive "boyfriend" how it is, & get him outtaa your life grrl, oooh and your guy friend? totallly giiit it. : )|`|PP1KswnAaa	you really should leave him bar his number and move on if he still hits you call the police because it agnst te law to hit women|`|ZqDvQprCaa	you need to leave him! <br>  no girl should be hit!<br>  just ignore him if he wont leave you alone and he'll finally give up!|`|bVRQKOwYaa	two words: restraining order.|`|Sblic4Eqaa	leave him and dont let him find out about the other guy if ur still dating him cuz he might beat u worse!|`|hGHtyS67aa	ur being a dumb ****...dump his ***|`|1AvqGNNRaa	u need to dump ur bfs ***!!!|`|RPdBmJ9Caa	O HELL NO! im a guy if i ever saw a girl gettin hit i would clock him in his face...leave him...restraining order if necesary..I am sorry but any man who hits a girl is a coward. Also that thing your feeling i doubt it's love....and also it shows he doesnt love you.... if you love someone you would never harm them you would protect them. ditch him....go with the other guy. ever hear of a song by the band:<br>   bury you dead<br>  its called "house of straw" look at the lyrics about an abusive relationship.<br>  <br>  love≠hitting<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	Get out of that situation.  You deserve better Im sure.  No one deserves to be hit.  Find someone that will love you and not take their anger out on you.  I work on the life squad and there was a lady who kept saying she would not go back to her husband that beat her, but the last time I went it was too late.  If you like the other guy go for it!  Get a restraining order against your bf now.|`|A8CuNgV2aa	okay first off; you need to leave this dude. If he's hitting you, its time to leave. And if he keeps bothering you, get a restraining order. <br>  Although it is abit wrong that you like another guy. But anyways the bottom line is; you have to leave this guy before it gets worse.<br>  Good luck:)|`|Sm44fi0jaa	if he hits you then thats abuse. break up with him. if he dosent leave you alone then call the police. but if you like the other guy then go out with him.|`|xV672tJcaa	I think it is wrong to like other guys when you have a bf. Also, your bf is taking advantage of you. That's sad that he hit you. You need to get out this relationship NOW, before it turns even WORSE!|`|qfBxQHCUaa	Forget Your Boyfriend <br>  Remember once a HITER always a HITER!!|`|nE68FMu2aa	Trust me im a guy (and I would never hit a girl).

aez7WCqQaa	Wait another day or two, that should bypass the clingy stage.<br>  <br>   Then just give her a casual call... Perhaps if it's her cell phone and you rather just get voicemail, call your voicemail and click the option to send a voicemail, just enter her number. This way, you can say what you want without any interruptions, and if she calls you back, then cool.<br>  <br>  She may have generally forgotten, but if it is now the next day [night], and she still hasnt called, there might be a mixed signal or she simply isn't interested any longer. Usually when a girl goes out with her friends, you should know by now that you were probably a huge topic of discussion... and friends can definitely impact her impression of you. I know it's not what you want to hear. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ElGZDUe7aa	WAIT IT OUT A COUPLE MORE DAYS<br>  <br>  I had a guy do what you are about to and it freaked me out and now we don't talk. Be patient. After 5 days just call her once. If she doesn't seem intrested move on.|`|t7hFh8STaa	I think you should wait it out and then call. If you find out that she is not interested in you, at least you will know that you tried and there will be no regrets.|`|33caf1c43f4b3140a0aa736cfd089b21aa	wait a couple days  and see wat  happen because if you keep callin her she might think you stalking her.|`|uLHtXibRaa	I would wait...if she leaves it more than two days perhaps you will need to call her yourself...|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	No, call her back.  She might have just been out late.|`|jfiF9XIUaa	I know that actions sat alot about a person but we have no clue what you guys talk about as far as liking eachother and forming a relationship so dont take it the wrong way unless she has like a snappy attitude towards you then i would be asking what's up? ya know|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Wait it out.  She is not sure of you and may not want to get involved further.  Give her time to sort out her feelings.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Wait it out. If you're "kind of dating" she will probably call back. Give it a few days.|`|2Fi3EmI8aa	Give her a few more days, then call her.  If she doesn't respond to that call, or call you back - then walk away.
a62788d28fb7418ac54ec8f66d13c9cbaa	Be yourself and people will learn to love you. If your cousins wants to change up her persona around her friends then let her make herself look stupid. In life people can either love you or hate you and it really sounds like you a good deal of peer pressure to me. Sit back be yourself and let people gravitate to you. If people don't think you are cool being who you are then maybe you need some new friends.
khFGiA1iaa	Be straight up with her and tell her how you feel. Something like this could work, "Hey babe, uhm listen. I have a modeling shoot coming up, but I need to talk to you about it. It's a shoot in underwear and swimsuits. I feel bad doing this shoot because I feel like I'm violating our relationship and I don't want to feel bad after. I'm doing it because it's paying $400 and I really need it. If you'd like, you can come with me... and I'd actually like it if you did. So, are you okay with it?" If you open up to her and tell her how you feel about it, but tell her why you are doing it & that she can come along if she wants... she'll be less upset and more open to the idea. She'll also appreciate that you came to her to explain and let her in on things. If she finds out what kind of shoot it is by herself, she'll feel like you are keeping secrets from her & start to question if you are telling her the complete truth all the time. <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Jessica|`|AA10953999	I did some modeling in college and never told my girlfriend, not because I thought it was too risqué but I felt a little embarrassed about the whole modeling thing. Only a handful of people knew at the time but I sure was happy with the money lol<br>  <br>  I did end up telling her eventually, she was more upset that she didn’t get to see the pictures than the fact that I modeled for someone. If you two have an open relationship then their shouldn’t be a problem telling her that you will be showing off your bulge in pictures lol|`|b3FkhOicaa	You have to ask her straight out, or else she will think you are trying to avoid it or hide it from her.  Just say, " I want to do a modeling shoot in a week, because I need the money.  I will be modeling swimsuits and underwear, is that okay with you?"  Ask her for her opinion, she may think it's okay!|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	um, its just a picture, you aren't cheating on her or anything, and with the money you could get her something nice ;)|`|BL4OBp0eaa	tell her you totally will not do the shoot if she gives your 400 $.|`|HV1UIaSQaa	Well it's only a photo shoot. It's not like you're going to be kissing other girls, so I don't think that you're violating anything. Like actors have husbands and wifes, but in some movies they have to kiss other people or even have sex scenes, its totally fine if it doesnt mean anything. Just tell her that you need the money.<br>  <br>  For more advice send an email to:<br>  goodnewsforpeoplewholovebadnews@live.c...|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	number 1, i think youre getting ripped off by only being paid $400 for a half-naked shoot. <br>  number 2, you do whatever brings home the bacon.<br>  number 3, why would you take this so seriously? its just a picture, not like youre gonna have sex with the photographer (altho i wont lie, that might be a possibility), so why would you feel ashamed? whats the big deal about showing off your body in a tasteful way? youre not naked or anything.... and besides, if youre being paid to show off your body, your girl should be proud, cuz that means youre HOT... altho i STILL think $400 is a little low.|`|kdksssi4aa	you either want to be a model or not.  If she knows what you do than ask her to go along watch.  Its your career and she must understand that,  as you if she were doing it.

Damn, you must be hot :o|`|HSVp66C3aa	Maybe you could bring her with you?|`|sr8HF6q0aa	Well she is your girl friend so I think the right thing to do would be to tell her the truth even if it hurts cause if you have a relationship and you lie to your gf about some of the little things and if she found out later then who knows it might be over so i would for sure tell her the truth|`|ufu5DlQ2aa	theres nothing wrong with that, its not your letting it all hang outt! and im sure shell understand and im prettty sure she would like have a model as a boyfriend|`|JThgHiaoaa	Its underwear on... and for $400 that's a lot of money... I'd do it.<br>  <br>  Best idea would to be straight up with her and say why your doing it and how you feel about it. Whatever you do, don't let her find out about it through a pamphlet/magazine or through a friend...
p9X6fX3naa	Don't sweat the small stuff, maybe he was having a bad day. If you boyfriend has self confidence issues, just show him how much you mean to him, and keep at it, he'll get eventually. But don't make him feel like crap, tell him how it makes you feel when he turns your word around.|`|rpPT4x5Baa	Sometimes there's nothing left to say and your relationship cannot grow if there is no communication between you two.|`|FsozOO6Zaa	This is weird. Maybe you guys don't feel the chemistry on the phone? As a couple, there should always be something to talk about no matter what! Anything and everything. I can understand if you were little kids and just said yes to go out with eachother than it would be awkward. If this is happening, it is strange. And as for his emotional problems...maybe he just doesn't take comfort or compliments well and just thinks you are saying that to make him feel better and that you don't actually mean it. Maybe he wants you to REALLY make it convincing to prove you really love and care about him and his feelings. wow, whose the girl in this relationship? haha just kidding.|`|mKULeVN4aa	well if u really like him<br>  sometimes carrying on a conversation with the guy u like is hard<br>  even if ur a very talkative person.<br>  i just dont think he thought talking to u was fun<br>  u have to like<br>  make it interesting<br>  about the other thing <br>  i think he just has low self esteem.|`|KhvXdMpNaa	well its kind of anoying to be on the phone with someone when no ones saying anything|`|YBvOE1IFaa	well, talk to him if it helps stay together. if it dosent break up|`|DIq4fO9oaa	I used to have someone kind of like that.<br>  In my opinion, I think you should ask him(subtly cus you dont want to bring up a big fight) what his problem was when he hung up on you. He shouldnt be rude like that when he knew full well that he was the one that offered to call back later in the first place.Just casually bring it up like 'was something wrong when you came off the phone earlier? cus you seemed kind of upset'. He has no reason to shout at you about that cus your not being rude or anything,your just being concerned. He shouldnt take it as an insult.<br>  <br>  With the second issue, i think you should confront him about why he thinks of himself in these ways,and tell him if he was so much like these things,you wouldnt have picked him. Say something like 'i picked you because i love every little detail about you'.<br>  Try and boost his ego a little, or change the subject if him putting himself down gets a little annoying.Or you could simply be straight with him and say that this is bumming you out.<br>  <br>  i hope that helps a little.|`|I2gs5opxaa	hi a lot to do with this is hes own ways of thinking , guys know if they like somone they never go quite or they try to show it , really most of this only he can change hes lucky that you do put up with  the way he is, but you thinking being wise can help him to like planing things to say do  like meets going out things thay u both can shere togher.|`|D9lOs6wOaa	He's not complicated. He seems to have low self esteem,or be depressed. It doesn't seem to bad i put myself down all the time as well, mostly for humor but i really don't think highly of myself. I wouldn't worry to much.|`|nOezzy5caa	when he turns what you say around come up with another way to turn it around again he will see that you actually mean it if u keep trying so hard to tell him that|`|NaFqCjfoaa	Oh yeah, this dude's a doucher.|`|WckZPkp8aa	one answer girl<br>  <br>  <br>  GUYS ARE WEIRD!|`|tuendbBeaa	Well, try to get to the root of the problem. Are you still in school? maybe it's stress, or some unfounded rumors that he doesnt want to confront you about.<br>  <br>  Is this his normal behavior? Has he suddenly changed into this sort of attitude, or was this just a one time occurance? <br>  <br>  Communication is key. Find out whats eating at him, and encourage to talk to other friends / family members if he can't talk to you. It may be a deeper issue.<br>  <br>  Are you having trouble holding fun and stimulating conversation? Try doing more then talking on the phone! Go out! do something different! If you're 21+ try a club you've never been to, or the new bar in town. (btw.. note on the clubs... I'm straight as an arrow, but i ind you can have the most fun in swinger / gay / lesbian clubs. these people KNOW how to party! )<br>  <br>  If you're >21, try new and adventurous things, anything more than the old dinner and a movie bit will do! Make your relationship more fun! this will automatically result in a broader range of topics to discuss when you're on the phone at 3 AM because you can't sleep :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

I remember being with guys like that.  But who said that phone conversations with your bf have to be hours long?<br>  Also, with him putting himself down, OBVIOUSLY he has some self esteem issues, and I bet he feels like hes not good enough for you right?  That is how my boyfriend is, but you just have to keep encouraging him eventually he will slowly start believing you.  If you try and say something to make him feel better and he turns it around on you, well...sorry hun but you gotta just be blunt sometimes.  Say he says something like...oh i am soo stupid, i cant even do whatever right, and if u say something nice, then he turns it around be like, okay no offense but why do you go and put yourself down all the time, becus obviously you want to hear something good, and when I say something thats nice and thats the TRUTH you just keep it going and saying something else thats negative.  Ask him why?  Why he does it, if theres something bothering him, and if you can help in any way. <br>  Get what I'm saying?  Try that...lemme know.|`|sr8HF6q0aa	Well clearly that guy has issues so if hes that sensitive and maybe you feel he isnt right for you then look for someone you can count on and rely on|`|qPTEmrMpaa	for one i have that problem to a cant talk to much about my problems to my friends because they have there own to worry about but about him hanging up he probally just got a little aggervated becasue he already suggested hanging up and talking later but you said no. and about him putting him self down it depends on what hes saying about himself. and he say that kind of stuff to you so you tell him different and him hearing you tell him didfferent make him feel good about him self you following what im saying ( ex. if he says hes ugly or not good enought for you hes wanting you to tell him that hes hot or hadsome and that he is enought for you and that hes a great person) he pretty much  doing to get complements from you to make himself feel better a lot of guys do that to get girls to feel sorry for them ive heard it some much that when i do i just tell them to stop saying that **** because they no its not true there just wanting attention or complements. hope this helps and sorry its so long i didnt no how to better explain my self..
Hk39AkNGaa	If you hurt some one that hard, then you have to let time heal it. In the mean time, give that person some space, to recover from that situation you placed him in. Maybe you should:<br>  -give time<br>  -get a very formal message<br>  -keep saying sorry<br>  - show how much you care, and tell him how much you like him<br>  <br>  If all fails, then dont give up!|`|qaMrAspCaa	why are you leading your friend on? you told him long distance isn't going to work, leave it at that! You need to pick the guy you like and move on. You can't have both.  You can apologize all you like, but it doesn't change the fact that you hurt him.  I would focus on your boyfriend, because if he knew that you were so worried about this other guy that you know likes you, he would have every right to not trust you.|`|4IwTGwpyaa	It sounds you hurt his ego. You have no interest in his erectile tissue, so he needs to look elsewhere for a partner.|`|WNymHApTaa	Give him time and space to adjust to the fact that you don't feel the same way about him as he does you.  After a few weeks just touch base with him as to what he has been up to.   Keep the conversation light.   Don't bring up the boyfriend, because no matter if he is over the hurt he still is not going to want to hear how wonderful your guy is.<br>  Good luck!

There are calculators out there to detect yours.

Starving yourself is not the way too go, you'll kill yourself and only eating once a day is bad because that will actually cause you to gain weight by slowing your metabolism down because your body needs energy and is storing all it can. Adding acai to your diet is a good idea, it's very healthy for you. I drink it and so does my mom. Eat more fiber and omega fatty acids. Eating more fish will help. Eat three healthy meals a day with 2 small, healthy snacks in between. Always it a complete, healthy breakfast and get your 8 hours. <br>  <br>  You just aren't trying hard enough. You can't do this overnight, it doesn't work that way, it takes hard work and dedication. You can't just stop eating or whatever.

It is definitely not safe.  What you do is you share out the normal portion you would eat.  Then separate it into two halves.  Eat the first half... then drink 2-4 glasses of water for the next 2-3 hours.  sometimes when you're body is thirsty it makes you eat to get the hydration from it.  then after the 2-3 hours you can eat the other half if you're still hungry for it.  <br>  <br>  continue to space out your meals-- never feel full when you eat, but never get hungry.  this should help you even out your weight.  Make sure you eat something small every 3 hrs... by small i mean half of your normal portion or less.<br>  <br>  get 1 hours worth of exercise at least 3 days a week. remember to stay hydrated.  and never starve yourself -- it'll slow down your metabolism so you lose weight for like a week, but then you'll gain it back and probably end up weighing more than before you starved yourself.<br>  <br>  Most importantly-- cut back on sweets and fats -- notice i said cut back and not cut out.<br>  <br>  If you follow what I said you'll never be hungry and your weight should even out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|8qVkSA4jaa	I used to be 175.

ggahM006aa	My cousins in Indiana had a gigantic wedding party but still had a ton more family members that they didn't want to leave out. So they were made 'special guests'. They didn't have any official duties and they bride and groom didn't have to buy them gifts. They just simply had on the same dress suit and corsage that was a complimentary color to the bridesmaids dresses and marched down the isle before the wedding party came out. If I'm not mistaken, they came out before the music. They sat down in the front row and left after the wedding party. It was cute.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	An overseas wedding?<br>  <br>  Rose petals instead of the rice or bubbles<br>  <br>  Dominant colours for the colour choice<br>  <br>  Different venue eg like on a boat, on an island, on top of a building, in a world known building, at the beach.<br>  <br>  Gifts to be something different and cute - like 5 sugar coated almonds in the cute little garden sets, Candles, coffee set for each guest.<br>  <br>  There are so many options but first thing is you need how many guests are coming and what there budget is etc.<br>  <br>  p.s ebay is great for wedding supplies<br>  etc:<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Wedding-Favors-100-Baseball-Theme-Mini-Gumball-Machines_W0QQitemZ250346380426QQcmdZViewItemQQptZWedding_Party_Supplies?hash=item250346380426&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A0%7C293%3A2%7C294%3A50" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Wedding-Favors-100-B...</a> cute favors.<br>  or<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/12P-X-Sweet-Heart-candles-in-Cup-Wedding-Favor_W0QQitemZ250373049206QQcmdZViewItemQQptZWedding_Party_Supplies?hash=item250373049206&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A0%7C293%3A2%7C294%3A50" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/12P-X-Sweet-Heart-ca...</a><br>   <br>  but there is so much you need to ask them before hand<br>  eg<br>  How much they want to spend<br>  where abouts they want the wedding<br>  how many guests are they inviting or are coming<br>  Colours they are wanting<br>  what time of the year<br>  what date<br>  how long do you have to plan for it etc<br>  Formal or semi formal wedding<br>  time of the day/night<br>  if they are having hair and makeup done (costs etc)<br>  where is she getting her dress etc<br>  where is he getting the suits<br>  how many are in the bridal party etc<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodluck its very stressful!!|`|sLwmzvi8aa	well i know this is not really that unique but i liked having bubbles being blown at my step mom (instead of rice)... it looks really nice cause then you get the light coming through... idk i liked it|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Groom had nine brothers so there was a best man and 8 users.

It will serve as the wedding favors to the guest as well as the guest book. People go in, take the 4 pictures, then go to a table which will be set up with scrapbook paper, pens, scissors, glue, etc. They can create a scrapbook page using the pictures from the booth and sign their name, put a little quote or message. Whatever they want. Props will be provided as well should they want to do something silly.<br>  It's definitely a unique thing and the photo scrapbook/guest book is very memorable.|`|zdpgxYyJaa	I have to say when I first read your lead in I was a bit confused on what you meant. <br>  <br>  Instead of a guest book have a photo of the couple with a large white mat around it and have people sign in there. Instead of throwing bird seed or blowing bubbles you can ring bells. Put disposable cameras on the guest tables so that they can take pictures at the reception. Use Christmas lights to create the mood. Give out a CD of music that is special to the couple as a wedding favor to each guest. Use sand instead of the traditional unity candle. <br>  <br>  Those are just a few ideas. Hope they help.|`|seU9VwIJaa	I agree with the first answer. I've been to weddings where an owl was the ring bearer (which was pretty sweet!), where couples have had their dogs as their ring bearer, ice sculpture punch fountain, drag queen wedding singer (awkward!)... if you can imagine it, I'm sure it's already been done, but that doesn't mean it isn't unique. The Knot always has really creative ideas.

1k7LIZVWaa	He sounds like he loves her and would like her to keep in shape.  She's being overly sensitive.  If he didn't care he wouldn't say anything.  She should be honest with herself and take some initiative and DO SOMETHING.  Maybe she shouldn't settle for 7 or 8, maybe she should strive for 8,5 or 9!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	From a 20 year happily married man.  A bunch of my married guy friends openly stare at my wife.  At 46 she is very fit.  Not model thin, but within 10 pounds of her marriage weight.  People get FAT over time.  Typically 2-3 pounds a year.  And my the wives of my guy friends notice their husbands looking but the wives don't seem to be motivated to get back in shape.    <br>  <br>  Over the years I have tried to create a schedule where my wife and I either work out together or help each other with house/klids so we both have plenty of time to stay fit.  I know my wife likes that I still get rock hard looking at her naked and at risk of sounding like a total pig, if she had gained 20-30 or god forbid 40 pounds I would be really bummed out.  PS:  I am not a muscle monkey, but I have stayed really fit for her.  Because I want her to look at me and smile just like she did when we met back in 1988.|`|k1StIPdnaa	It is unacceptable. If he wants her to get fitter, he should just suggest they start exercising together. She would lose some weight, and would be happy to spend some time with her husband at the same time.|`|0213a878584dfe668851e9dfd2d6a2e0aa	He was just stupid for saying it out loud.|`|AA11367901	If I was an 8 there would be no worry. How many men can be as skinney as an 8 woman? <br>  I just can't stand a man like that. They want a woman to look like Barbie. Some have big bellies and look awful. What a Jerk!|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	He is stupid for saying it out loud.  And she is unfair for asking it in the first place.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is, so many people are so into looks.  Looks fade for us all.  As we age things change.  <br>  <br>  She better get more confidence and quit caring about what others think so much (and setting him up for failure by asking a question that will upset her unless he lies). He needs to be quiet.|`|AA11811644	i married my for better or worse,ive been married for 24 yrs.some days are better than others depending on wither she is having a good hair or not a good hair day,lol.looks and sex is not everything.you young people need to get that down,that its not all about sex and looks.if thats what you are looking for dont get married.just a little wisdom for you to think about.|`|da189a0fdeada9df73b4c278f6ebd72aaa	Remember the saying for better or worse? They should also analyze themselves also.Everyone changes as we grow older. We can't all be the same size either. What a dull world this would be if everyone was the same perfect size. Beauty is only skin deep.personality says it all.<br>  everyone should look pass the flaws, and be thankful for what we have.|`|R9TobyWBaa	Sure she should lose weight and be more appealing. She would be just as nasty and judgmental about him if he didn't work or bring home money.|`|owWx8ftvaa	To any woman with a heart, he's an asshole...But realistically, he's just saying how it is.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I would rather have it like I have now.  My wife and I are getting old and our looks are deteriorating. So What  It is what's inside that counts.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I think every man has a different preference.  Some guys like their women thicker, others like them thinner, others really don't care at all and have different needs.<br>  <br>  I think this guy is just feeling guilty for hurting his wife's feelings and is trying to justify it by saying it's "normal".  Any man with tact knows that if a woman asks "what do you rank me on a scale of 1-10?" he's supposed to say "20" even if it's complete bullshit.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	He is being shallow by wishing she were more attractive, but so is she.  She should never have put him in the position to answer that question.  She worried about what he rates her looks?  What about asking how he rates her as a wife?<br>  <br>  Do they have any children?  I know my body will never be the same after my pregnancies.  I will always have a pooch because I have separated stomach muscles.  I can work out and lose weight and feel great about my body, but still have imperfections.<br>  <br>  Everyone does.  <br>  <br>  The only perfect bodies out there are photoshopped.  Maybe they both have unrealistic expectations of what a woman's body should look like?|`|g6n3OnmSaa	That was really stupid to say that out loud to her.  That would be the same thing as her telling him he had a teensy tinsy man area and expecting it not to affect his self-cofidence.  It would just be really stupid.  Most people know better than to do this sort of stuff to a loved one.|`|DjDoyCR6aa	I think he's a jerk for saying it, i mean from experience, sometimes i dont find myself attractive and when i see a beautiful woman pass my husband and i, i get insecure, and ask my husband if he wishes i looked different, thinner, or thicker, bigger breasts, or bigger butt.. but he always tells me that im perfect, that he loves me the way i am, whether or not he truly means that and not just saying it, i wont ever know. but sometimes i do get the feeling that he wishes i was a victoria secret model or somthing :) .. your friend shouldnt listen to him, if she feels comfortable and sexy when she dresses up to go out, then shes beautiful, because its true its whats on the inside that counts, her husband shouldnt be concerned about her weight..
1YdeUn1Caa	Stop disappointing her for one. When she tells you not to do something, don't do it. Is that so hard? Keep him out of the house. Period. Maybe you shouldn't go over his either. He seems like trouble, if he gets you to ignore your mother. Find a boyfriend who will respect your mothers wishes. Maybe get you to do the same. This one obviously has no respect for them.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Talk to her and apologize, but say you like this boy. Tell her that even if it isn't a serious relationship, you like who you like. Ask her why she has a problem with your boyfriend (nicely) and hear her out. Don't interrupt and let her talk. She will really appreciate you letting her get her opinion in. There really should be a need to get her trust back. After all, she is your mother. But if things don't improve, ask her yourself. Good luck.
n8lXItGraa	Be supportive of him...not nagging. Tho you don't approve, and he knows that, it doesn't change the fact that he smokes.  He hides it from you because you disapprove and he doesn't want to upset you.  He will quit again when he is ready...not when you want him to, it doesn't work that way.  It is his addiction to overcome when he is ready.  Support him instead of accusing him of lying.  He just doesn't want to see the disapproval in your eyes.  Hope this helps....|`|RtkB46peaa	If you just want him to be honest, tell him that even if he is smoking, you'll respect his right to do so and won't nag.  He's not telling you because he wants to avoid the disappointed lecture that is sure to follow.<br>  <br>  If you want him to be honest, and you want him to quit, well, that's a whole nother situation.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	He may be feeling crowded because he feels you are hounding him too much.  When you do that, he may want to hide things so he doesn't have to deal with you.  I think you might want to back off.  I got stressed just reading your question, relax girl.|`|AA10248966	You married him this way and now are trying to change him. Drop that nonsense, because it doesn't work!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You married a guy who smokes.Let him smoke.He is hiding it from you to keep from being griped at hon.<br>  Haven't you figured that out yet?Or he does not want to have to deal with you about it.<br>  It usually takes the LORD to deliver someone from an addiction.I had a friend who used to smoke and chew tobacco at the same time, the LORD delivered him from it in the early 90's and he hasn't done either since.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	He doesn't trust you enough to tell you the truth.  Maybe you judge him too much?  Or he's just ashamed to be smoking, so telling you just makes him feel worse.  I think it's good that you called him on the lies, but if you want him to come to you, you can't punish him for his behavior.  Just like teens not telling their parents stuff, they don't want to get into trouble so they hide things.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	Dear Mary: Your husband is a smoker and you are a nag. You can support his decision to quit, but you can't do it for him. He's done it before. leave him alone. He already knows you don't want him to smoke. He already knows it's bad for him. If he needs to smoke now, let him.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Smoking is a very addictive habit.  I still crave a cigarette occasionally and quit years ago.  The more you ride his butt about it the less likely he'll quit.  Just remind him about how hard it was for him to quit the first time and hopefully he'll give it up.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	My friend revealed everything she was hiding from him then he opened up a revealed everything he was hiding.  Now they have a very open relationship.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	dont push him too much.. just leave it alone and he will eventually quit when he think is the best time.. <br>  Good Luck with u..|`|AA11208683	you want him to be open with you then you gotta stop pushing him about smoking. if you are constantly mad at him or asking him about it he is going to hide it from you because he doesn't want you to find out. he doesn't want to be confronted about it. just be thankful that he isn't an addicted smoker. he probably just starts smoking when hes stressed or somthing. i know you don't like it, but be happy hes not doing it in the house or anything like that. he will open up when you stop pushing him to. keep loving him and show him you love him no matter what. he needs to know that. GOOD LUCK!|`|xs5J6VJTaa	OK, reality is, your husband is addicted to smoking. If he wasn't he wouldn't smoke at all.<br>  Quitting smoking is one of the hardest things for someone to do. It is the most addictive drug on the planet. Maybe he is ashamed and embarrassed at the fact that he can't quit. <br>  Accusing him of lying to you and going behind your back may be a little harsh and the reason he is pushing away.<br>  You should try a more soft supportive approach. Tell him that you know he smokes. say you are worried for his health but you also understand how hard it is to quit. <br>  Maybe you can go and see the doctor together to get help. (mind you this will only work if he wants to quit)<br>  Try and spend more time together too. Maybe go out for dinner more often to a place that is non-smoking and enjoy each others company. It will take his mind off the cigarettes.|`|7DoR1QKuaa	Maybe you should realize that you can't make your husband stop smoking.  Wanting a loved one to stop something that is detrimental to their health is only right, but you can't make him.  Smoking is addictive, and that is a decision he is going to have to make for himself.  The best you can do is support him, not pressure him.  Tell him how you feel out of love, and leave it alone.|`|a66nvk0taa	Count your blessing he not having an affair. So stop nagging him|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	"...I really didnt want him to but i cant control him."<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've tried though.  Maybe that's the problem?<br>  <br>  Why don't you stop trying to control him and see if he feels more open with you?
1YdeUn1Caa	You don't. Her parents don't want you around, and since she is a minor, she needs to listen to them. You are causing more problems between her and her parents. Is that what you want. Your friend with parents that hate her because she goes against them? Think hard about this.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You can't. They don't trust you nor will you ever be trustworthy in their eyes. You knew you weren't supposed to go over there, and you did. You knew that she isn't allowed to date you, yet you continue. You should have behaved yourself. You blew it. Dump her. With the next girlfriend, follow the parents rules.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	too late. parents don't like sneaks around their homes or their children.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You can't.You blew it and i I were her parents,I'd be up her butt 24-7 and  having you arrested every time I saw you.You disresp ected them in their own house and you want to know why they hate you?<br>  Grow up and learn to respect them,start by apologizing, and you tell them what you did was wrong and there is NO excuse for what you did.They might soften up after a year or so.During that time you better make good grades, get a job and do something with your life to prepare for the future son.|`|Sm44fi0jaa	dude if you like her that much then prove yourself to her parents. Take them out to dinner or something|`|7Fc22teCaa	Time, heals all wounds, so settle in.. if you really like this girl this could take awhile.|`|A8CuNgV2aa	By sneaking into her house, you have completly lost her parents trust. Now you need to regain it. <br>  Good luck.
tL2U34kraa	I would think hard of things you like to do. you say you like to do things with your hands, does a florist or a gardner sound appealing to you? what if you work in a craft store, I am not sure what types of stores are crafty in your area. I think, although I do not know you, that a florist position would appeal to you, one you get to create, two you get to work with plants, and three you get paid to get dirty, and you are making something people will pay money for and a good chunk of it too many arrangements go for $40-$100. I was very much like you I tried out different things but nothing really appealed to me, i had many friends who got married and i offered to help go dress shopping, i love helping them get ready for the big day and now am working on being a wedding planner, I found out just one day how much i loved it.so i think if you try you can find your dream job too.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Yeah your question is similar.

Expecially when you see people from high school.  Don't second guess yourself, you know what you know.  If your good with video production, do that.  But if you are one of those people that love to have big christmas and halloween displays, you might want to try you a arts and crafts business or find a way to mix both.  What I am trying to say, life is too short to worry about the small things.  It sounds like the arts and crafts is a good hobby.  Keyword:Hobby.  The video production is something that can thrive and grow if you put your all into it.  The biggest thing is your 26 and happy, everything else will fall into place. Stop worrying.

It's ok not to know how to be be a good kisser. I'm sure you'll get better at it. Just keep on kissing her! And she will probably teach you a few things about being a good kisser. In no time you'll be an amazing kisser! Also, do some research and see what you can do to be better and see what women like when men kiss them. Good luck man!|`|gGQgPTaeaa	well i kno how that awkward phase is. but ok this is what you do first off if u really dont kno whut ur doing literally go with the flow. <br>  rub ur tongue across her teeth or on the inside of her lip<br>  dont be to rough yet cause thats not cool and girls dont like that<br>  use ur hands dont let em just linger by ur sides because if u do it gets really weird<br>  rub them through her hair make sure she likes that though. <br>  just try to like it MAKE SURE YOUR BREATH DONT STINK.<br>  nd dont go to deep on wit the tongue thats unnatural but jst a little play play wit the tongue is fun flirty and might get u some:D|`|tuendbBeaa	Heehee, i remember when i was a kid i used to practice by kissing my fist... sounds weird, but hey, whatever works right? But if you are in a decent relationship with the girl... ask here how she WANTS to be kissed... every girl likes it their own way.|`|nrS6u7Eyaa	uhh hope it helps<br>  less saliva, bad breath is a turn off to everyone of course<br>  tilt ur head sideways haha|`|bZA3TntMaa	if your just kissing, just hold her close and tight and press your lips together. I hate soft kisses. just do whatever feels right, dont pooch out your lips.go with the flow.|`|xbjc2yzOaa	Just go with the flow..only you can teach yourself to kiss buddy. You'll get the hang of it|`|oXRZfAWaaa	Play the fool; ask her to teach you.|`|8PkEkTcZaa	start by kissing slow and let them lead you on if you don't know and you will get better|`|FL0S2tSCaa	dont push your lips out, and if u dont your fine|`|Vu3zOoBbaa	experience|`|tISJYHJNaa	Was that your first kiss?|`|i7LE8xziaa	practice with "your friend"|`|VQ7xuFjtaa	Do lip ups lol

wmoKm4jHaa	Ok, when i was in Jr, high, I hated. went through same stuff. My biggest concern would be making sure he's at a school he LIKES.lower chances of him dropping out, and plus you want him happy. i would tell a guardian at the school because once it gets physical u shouldnt mess around about it.|`|INLQHsl7aa	try a martial art, not 4 revenge just 4 self defense. coz he cannot always hide.

tz6ksGFkaa	I don't understand the part where the ex isn't paying child support but is under the impression he will be getting custody.<br>  There are free legal service for you and my first step would be to get an attorney and force him to pay the child support he owes.<br>  You also very much need to learn to drive just to be able to be an independent person.<br>  Can't your father or brother teach you?<br>  Best of luck!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	The rest of your family can care for your mom there is also home health services who can help out.Move with your friend and tell your ex that he has not paid child support and you are going to have him jailed soon unless he backs off.He will back off.<br>  Or you can get an apt and go to the local churches to see about food.Tell the social worker you want to get an education so you can get a decent job.If they are worth their pay they will help you do this.<br>  Also explain to the churches your situation, they may be able to help you get a car.|`|TvGqrcr9aa	I would take the offer from your friend. You're family can take care of your mom, you need to do what's right for you and your child. Your ex is an idiot and is trying to scare you. If he's not paying child support there's no way in hell he'll get custody. Talk to a lawyer and get all of the back pay he owes you. They take dead beat dads very seriously these days.
hNSZlSMPaa	Check with you local police department. Once he has moved out but still does not have all his stuff, I think you have the right to ask that a policeman be around when he comes over.   At least that is what happens in our area but we have to ask the police to come.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	No he's not right, Once he's gone, He's gone & that's when the court orders begin. The 24th is just the latest he can move.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	He can still come back IF he has not moved everything that legally belongs to him.  He has until the 24th, so he doesn't have to move everything in one day.
a62788d28fb7418ac54ec8f66d13c9cbaa	This happens to me all the time but i don't take dreams that serious at all. It sounds like you feel guilty about something you did to him or you just can't stop thinking about him because you think you made a mistake.  You are probably are thinking about him unintentionally, sounds silly but it's true one day your mind my just wonder and there he goes again. I don't decode dreams but it sounds like hes is no good if you are getting chased by a dog and he is smiling at you. Anyway maybe this dream may suggest that you guys may come to a point where you set aside your differences but your friends may get in your way with their silly advice.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	what if?  it's just a dream.  live in the real world.|`|xs5J6VJTaa	It is just a dream.

mZGwwX6Baa	I accept your observation that nowadays youths don't take matters by mind but by physique.Todays competitive world hence the rat-race give way to this.They are always in a bee line to compete with someone;be it financially or any other reason.All these leading to rage fill their minds.<br>  But martial arts do not produce any kind of aggressiveness in anyone,whereas there are many sessions in them where people are taught how to control rage and face a situation.By doing various kinds of martial arts; actually a person is concentrating on a situation by both body and mind simultaneously.He learns to control his mind,hence won't allow the mind to be his master,but vice-versa.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sometimes anger stops you from freezing when someone attacks you...<br>  <br>  martial arts is a very important part of some peoples lives (mine included)... a good teacher shows the ways to subdue an attacker and helps the student survive something that ordinarily they might not...<br>  <br>  children (and adults) are taught the skills, and other important things... discipline, perseverance, respect, etc...<br>  <br>  before JUDGING something, maybe you need to attend some classes (properly run ones) and learn first hand... :D|`|60727b7a69fa8d5147eadb2d20e17e83aa	the very FIRST thing they are taught is ANGER CONTROL<br>  in any martial art<br>  <br>  they are also taught discipline, and never to use as an instigator<br>  only SAFE, SELF DEFENCE<br>  they can dissarm, and diffuse knife weilding thugs safely<br>  <br>  you are arguing a moot point<br>  from start to finish|`|OvsJkVPuaa	I disagree...learning martial arts is not teaching a child to exercise his/her skills on everyone..course you would teach your child when to defend themselves...it has nothing to do with soft heart or not...M sure if theres a begger at the door that child wont go and break their face. What happen to the bullies in school? the streets? who try to rape a girl? or kidnapp for that matter??? they should have a soft heart? NO!! I strongly disagree...and if someone steals for the first time cuz he is hungry??? there is something call ASKING is always better than stealing YOU DO IT ONCE ..YOU WILL DO IT AGAIN. So its good to learn a lil bit of everything cuz the world we live in now?? its a requirement.|`|OUOIOx8vaa	Im 15. And i was raised to avoid fights mainly because they get you in trouble. I was taught to control my anger. Just get away from the tension and breathe. Think. Some kids my age take defense the wrong way and think they can slam anyone down. And its reputation too. If you walk around and say you dont play. you should be able to show it when you fight. I think thats stupid.|`|vTydX5YQaa	true. teaching self defence without maturity is not good<br>  as you say , they should be given morals education from young age in school<br>  later if need be given some self defence skills to protect them in emergency situations especially for girls <br>  non violence is allways better|`|cJvefYWlaa	my opinion is this<br>  your un-solicited advice is un--needed<br>  mabey if your so gung ho about angry kids you should do somthign about it instead of posting things on the interenet that no one will read|`|sNQvkXuMaa	yes,what you told is exactly right.youngsters must be taught to have patience before they could do anything.|`|UARQA0CLaa	I don't know where you live, but my children grew up in a city where violence is an every day occurrence.  They feared going to school because of the fights and possibility to being jumped in the bathroom.  By the time my daughter was in 8th grade she could take no more and I ended up home schooling her.  Martial arts teaches children discipline by the way.  In today's world, self preservation is first and foremost in the minds of most people.  Our young people need to know how to defend themselves.  The police are overburdened and from the looks of our government there will be little or no stimulus package money coming to law enforcement.  You need to get your head out of the sand and take a look around you.  Violence has grown in America.|`|et1KtH3oaa	I wouldn't care if it's someone stealing for the first time, I'd rather have someone ask me for something to eat, let me go buy them a burger and be done with it.  If someone is trying to steal something from me as woman when someone comes to attack you there's a million things going through your mind, I have no idea what they're planning on doing to me after they snatch my bag and money.<br>  <br>  Most fighting is done due to ignorance and we should teach our children that fighting doesn't change everything.<br>  <br>  but there's no reason for there to be a backup, i took self defense in college and I'm happy that I did.

AA10065812	For 20 years I've worked with divorced and single fathers<br>  <br>  Part of the problem with getting visitation enforced is knowing what to do to prove your case, and how to remind the judge of their responsibilities.  Let me start with the judge.<br>  <br>  Always take people with you to court who are not there to testify.  Make sure they are sitting where the judge can see them, with each equipped with a tablet and pen to take notes.  Better yet, use a Court Watch Form designed for this purpose.  I have one in the manual at Dads House.<br>  <br>  If the judge is not doing his job, using the info from this form can be used to get him/her removed or sanctioned.<br>  <br>  There are things you can be doing. Most important you need to keep a daily journal on all your activities. There does not need to be any violence for a claim of violence to be filed. She gets a restraining order because she fears him because she has been preventing him from seeing her child. <br>  <br>  Many think that all courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lack the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights. This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney. It is also important to do as much as possible on his own and not pay the attorney to do it.<br>  <br>  You need to write her a letter notifying her of intent to exercise visitation rights. Make two copies, and sign all three. Mail two of them, one certified and one with Delivery Confirmation (75￠ + postage).  If she rejects the one, she still receives the other. If the certified letter come back, file it unopened. By use of an internet connection, you can print out the Confirmation of Delivery of the other letter.<br>  <a href="http://www.usps.com/send/waystosendmail/extraservices/deliveryconfirmationservice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usps.com/send/waystosendmail/...</a> <br>  <br>  Show up with witnesses in tow. Do not enter her place alone. If you can record, have someone video record from the car. Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record audio and/or video without the woman knowing. If her state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling, which says one person in a conversation, must know they are being recorded.

They will come out and look at the paperwork, note the case number, and make a report.  Not abiding by the divorce decree is punishable by law, and can result in fines and/or imprisonment.  He may also try talking with the local law enforcement and see if they would be willing to escort him, with paperwork in hand, to pick up his daughter.  If not, just keep documenting EVERY SINGLE TIME he tries to get her and isn't allowed.  Then, take her to court.  She may just find her self in a lot more trouble than she cares for, and will start upholding her end.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	he can take her back to court a demand his visitation and if she keeps dodging him he can refile for custody claiming that she is refusing him his rights and feels if he was custodial parent things would be handled more fairly|`|iD4ejChZaa	sounds like she is breaking their contract, he needs to grow a set.<br>  obviously she is bitter about something,  if he was a real man he'd contact his attorney.|`|SzQi9N7daa	Well he needs to drag her back into to court for contempt charges.  Child Support and Visitation are separate issues, one is not tied to the other.  If she is not allowing him to see her or have her on her regularly scheduled weekends then simply document each time she says no.  Also ask since I cant have her this weekend how about next?  Document if she denies that as well. Sometimes legit things do come up and cannot be avoided.  However, it sounds as if she is just being petty.  Make sure you have all the dates and times she has denied visitation.  I would warn her nicely that you will take her back to court to have his visitation rights enforced.  Push comes to shove and she stands a chance at losing her parental rights and spending a night in the Iron Bar Hotel for contempt.  Mind you those are very rare cases. Doctors appointments, dentist, hair, or what ever, I'm sure he is just as capable of taking her for these visits as well.     <br>  <br>  Been there done that I had to have a police officer come with in order to get the kids one time.  He simply reminded her that she is under a court order and he was here to make sure it was being followed. That and a visit to the judge put stop to her games.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it really sucks when grown adults act worse than kids.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	I agree totally with Mrs. B, document every time she with holds the child from him and call law enforcement!! This is a court order and she can be in a lot of trouble for pulling this crap, tell him to have his court papers handy at all times so if and when he needs police assistance he has that to back him up! Tell him to not let one more incident slide, next visit if she pulls anything, call the authorities right away and ask that they come out and escort him there to get his daughter, if this continues tell him to file for another court hearing, when he goes tell him to have all documentation on hand (police reports, documentation of dates and times as well) this will back him up!! He is the father and has his rights to see that child and this woman better reckon with it or she could be in a heap of trouble!! And tell him no matter how mad he may get NEVER yell, cuss or say anything that she can use against him, tell him to just be calm and tactful!! Good luck to you and i hope this all gets resolved soon for the benefit of the child!!|`|29ef3b425c997be8f850f8ab0a765cfcaa	See a lawyer.

This is what he should do. <br>  1. Make sure he is paying her with a check ( this way he can show the courts that he is making payment.<br>  2. Take her butt back to court and let the judge know that she is not letting him see the child.<br>  3. Ask the court to set up a place for her to drop the child off.( like the county court house) If the judge does this she will have to drop the child off and if she does not... Then you have a 2nd witness that can tell the judge what she did.|`|xkGfxn70aa	He needs to contact his lawyer and they will get her for contempt of court.  He pays his child support,  and if there is a dentist appt. then why can't daddy take her. After all he is her daddy.  He needs to call her bluff. good luck
cHF1PwRdaa	People can just be happy with themselves. However, everyone needs love to survive. It may be the love of a parent or  friend, but, everyone needs love in one way or another.
DzAFT8VDaa	I think so and I am struggling with this myself. Everyone tends to have a mental image of who they want to be with and a lot of times, I think, this reflects what is not only attractive to you, but important to you, e.g. work ethic, morals, philosophical beliefs.<br>  <br>  Well, I am in love with someone who is the oil to my water. We mix, but when we separate...And this is very frustrating. The very things I love about our differences are some of the very things I dislike about him. Some of his beliefs and actions, to me, say that he needs to grow up, he doesn't make sound decisions sometimes and is willing to take risks that I find objectionable.<br>  <br>  All of this to me, says that I haven't made a good choice in a partner, although, on the other hand, he IS a stand-up guy, he's kind, intelligent, giving & willing to compromise.<br>  <br>  I say we are judged by the company we keep and sometimes that company has good points and bad - just like us.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Of course you can. The person you choose to marry is then your other half. Together you should make a whole. You can learn a lot about yourself by looking at the way you live with your spouse. There are too many variables to post every possible combination of couple types and what they mean together. But yes. The answer to this is yes.|`|5687JygEaa	I don't think you can, but the choice of someones significant other's may reflect what they lack or what they like about people. Example: say you like funny type of people and you date someone who is extremely funny. this just tells people what you are attracted to.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Not in all cases bc sometimes opposites attract each other and these two might not have a single thing in common.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I dont really think so.  My husband and I are complete opposites.  We have very few things in common.  Yet, somehow we work.  He keeps my somewhat grounded, as I tend to be a dreamer.  I keep him responsible, as he tends to be like a kid alot of the time.  We complement each other's personalities.  People that know each of us from different situations but don't know that we are married are always surprised to find out.  We always get comments like "wow, i would have never guessed".  I like it, because he is everything I am not, and vice versa.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	Yep!  Just like that saying-<br>  "Tell me who you love- and I will tell you who you are."

Women forget about the guys that they have had brief flings with, so they routinely under report how many people that they slept with (and women also lie). <br>  <br>  Men, on the other hand, remember every sexual encounter, including ones that only happened in their mind, so they over report their sexual conquests.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Multiple partners, smart one.|`|AA12281578	Simple.....one girl.

It's proven that guys think about sex more then girls, thus this could influence the staement. Another reason is that a guy could have sex with more then 1 girl... If the guy has sex twice, he could have had sex with 2 girls. And not to offend any guys, but guys often pressure sex into relationships more so then girls and if they do have sex and break up, the guy is more likely to get into another relationship and have sex and the girl is less liekly because she may think that the sex ruined their relationship. Hope I helped!|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	It means that guys are more sexually active than girls. <br>  Let's say there's BOB and SALLY.

It's a bigger deal to us.|`|oP7Y7OxAaa	ok i dont know how ppl can be so stupid, ok theres guys that will have alot of sex with different girls whil girls dont have sex with just anybody or they have less partners well atleast guys most of the time do it more then most girls. in a life time a guy can have hundreds of girls, but in a girls life time she might only have like a hand full. see what i mean??? unless ur asking the question all wrong?|`|SzrP0wWPaa	What i remember from high school is that orgasm for a woman takes longer to achieve than for a man, so often the girl doesnt actually attain a full orgasm because the man will stop once he attains his, sometimes faking it or simply omitting it. Know what i mean?|`|G8OFN3uyaa	Yeah, it makes sense.<br>  <br>  Personally, there's more bisexual and lesbian women out there than there are bisexual and gay men. I'd say women have more sex.|`|8ngDDwhVaa	It just means that guys are more sexualy active. If a guy has three g/f's a month and has sex w/all of them, but each g/f only has sex w/him, he is more sexualy active than they are.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Lol...<br>  <br>  Yeah the only explanation is that lesbians cannot have "Sex" but I guess you could argue that sex is between a penis and a vagina. <br>  <br>  Who knows? More fleshlights in the world I guess?|`|PlHjhwtAaa	there seems to be a quite larger ratio of sexually active guys than girls, but it doesnt necessarily make the statement true|`|O54a7B8Maa	Because guys can have sex with more than one girl.

GHH1i6d3aa	I think you hold yourself to an unrealistic standard.  Nobody's perfect, so stop telling yourself you have to be before you'll consider yourself attractive.  Attractiveness is all a state of mind - thus why ugly fat guys can get lots of babes, and attractive guys w/ no self esteem don't get squat.  <br>  <br>  In human nature, most women want to be dominated.  Just as most men prefer to dominate.  And most men tend to want women like their mothers, and most women want men like their fathers, because it's what's familiar.  So I think you're selling people a little short.  <br>  <br>  If you can stop judging yourself, you might be able to find some happiness.  Whether it's to get a partner or not, you have to let go of this perfectionist thing.  It's aggravating.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	I think your last paragraph clinches it.

7VjhcEk8aa	I am so sorry to hear that you are going through this.... I was in your shoes about a year ago....Notice I said was....He did just what your husband is doing and in the same order....1st he would say thing like its MY MONEY its MY HOUSE....Then the put downs like telling me I was lazy cause I didn't wake up til 9 am....And I was the one that was working, cooking, and cleaning....He even kicked me out of my own house...excuse me HIS HOUSE!!!!.....It didn't stop there though soon after all of that he tried to hit me....I don't know your whole story but sounds like you need to get out of a dead end sittuation....Think of your Daughter too....My parents were un happy and they divorced...I think that was the best thing they could have done for my Sister and I...I know I wouldn't want to grow up seeing my mother sad all the time...Well I hope I helped at all....You will be in my prayers!!!!|`|CD5JsjxKaa	If you've tried talking to him to no avail then you should go for marriage counseling. if he cannot learn to listen to you and communicate with you then you need to get a third person involved and get them to help you sort out your problems. hopefully the counsellor and get him to see that he needs to respect his wife (you) and respect and appreciate the things you do for him. the counsellor can help him understand that you two have defined roles in the house and no role is less or more important than the other. if you weren't there to look after your child, who would? and what job is more important than looking after a child? food on the table is useless if the child is neglected. the child needs both physical support (food, shelter, clothing) AND emotional support (love, encouragement, comfort). He provides the former and you provide the latter. BOTH are vital for the proper upbringing of a child. if you cannot convince him of your importance then you need to get a counsellor to do it for you. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Sounds like he is bitter you get to stay at home. I dont know why some men are like this. Being a stay at home mom is difficult. You would think he wouldve grown up and became a man by now right? I would just continue to be who you are. I would maybe pack up some stuff and stay at my parents for a while if my husband did me this way. Who does he think he is after all? Its not just his money its yours as well. Maybe he has some other issues he is battling I would just give him space. Honey he owes you an apology!|`|iKJycf6Zaa	Don't ask him for money, don't do chores, make sure you eat and feed your daughter. Just show him you are giving up on everything.

I really don't know you or who you are, but no one should take what you were given. "Some advise!" Get your things and stay some where for a few days and let him find you! Why? His mind game is to belittle you emotionally, let him see what it's like when he comes home to an empty house. You see, no man can really take what he puts out in a negative way. When he's ready to hear what you have to say, let him know what he has done and why you felt you had to do what you have to do.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Don't think it is about getting through. Possibilities are either he felt trapped or he had trouble at work.<br>  <br>  The trap part is because he is carrying the majority of the financial load. That's why it is not a good idea to have kids and go to school at the same time.  Chances are your family is not saving much.  He may feel he makes the money but it's all gone.<br>  <br>  The current economic environment puts most workers on edge.  Things may be tight at work and he doesn't know how to tell the family -- some men consider keeping their job a statement of their manhood.<br>  <br>  Both cases are about money.|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Some people are not plea-sable. He will not know what a gold mine he has until your gone. And when I say gone that means him begging you for weeks to come back and if you decide to go back you need to set boundaries because it sounds like he has set plenty for you and you have none for him he needs to treat you with RESPECT. After all it sounds like you treat him like a king and he is taking you for granted. This may sound bad but you need to discipline him as if he were your kid. Seriously if he does something that hurts your feelings you NEED to reprimand him and do it over and over until he treats you right! It sounds bad but it works, men want mommies and we have to let them know this is not to be expected. If we choose to do so you must appreciate it!|`|uiC89Q6aaa	DIVORCE him!

Why?  You know what you are worth and he should also know your value as his partner.  But all he cares for is himself.<br>  <br>  This person is not a man, this is a child.  You have been thrown from your home like a piece of trash.  How insulting.  And you want to get through to him?  I would want to be through with him.<br>  <br>  You can't teach a pig to dance.  Go home to your family.  Stay there until he agrees & goes to counseling to try to save your marriage.  Do not allow your daughter to see you being treated this way.  This type of history has an awful way of repeating itself.

Yikes :(<br>  <br>  At least he's not blowing his money on a new car or $10,000 home electronics rig for home theater or something irresponsible like that.<br>  <br>  Well ... it looks like you're getting a head start on the " ... for worse" and " ... for poorer" part of the vows. <br>  <br>  It's understandable to feel disillusioned and no doubt that this may cast a bit of a pall over the wedding. Be that as it may - if he's the one, he's the one and essentially you have 2 choices: Either do your best to enjoy this time and get past it, have a lovely wedding and a future in which you will emerge from these struggles a stronger more committed couple, or postpone the wedding. If this is the first big crisis you've had to face together, this could indeed be a way for you to see how he handles himself under stressful situations.

It is true that you knew he has kids but that is no excuse for him putting everything on you. Maybe the two of you should talk it out with an arbitrator or post pone your wedding or something. I definitely don't think you are being selfish. I don't think he is either but he is being rather thoughtless. Hope you guys work it out. Good luck.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Honestly?  I think you've been way too generous, and your fiance has been taking advantage of your good nature.  Fair enough he had to fly home for a family emergency, but allowing you to pay for more than half the wedding is a bit much.

Good Luck to you both|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Your not being selfish at all. I think you've done just about all you can do and he can atleast put effort into it.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I would halt everything right now.<br>  <br>  Re-evaluate in 6 months.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	He sounds like an a hool ,,,what are you doing with him? are you gonna let him use u? wedding ring you have to buy urself? what a nonesense!it just makes me MAD|`|bc9inzicaa	honestly, i would re-evaluate the entire marriage idea.  It's six weeks before you two are to get married, yet he is spending all the WEDDING money on other stuff.  Going to see his sick mother is completely understandable, but seriously, did he have to pull from the wedding account?  Does he not have any other kind of savings?  <br>  <br>  Also, his family should be buying their own tickets to come for the wedding!!!  Seems to me that you are doing more in this relationship than he is.|`|o1yy6KABaa	No you arent over reacting, but I think you may be losing the point - its a wedding,  once you are married your money is his anyway. And its just a tough time for him, I mean, I dont know how or why he lost his job but he did, and it was important to be by his family. This is pretty much a test to see how well you support each other - you just need to sit back and not just focus on the wedding, but also think about what he has been going through.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	If you want the wedding, you've gotta put up the cash for it.  Eventually your husband will be picking up the slack for you, so just know that things will even out in the end.  Just relax and enjoy the wedding.  Don't replace what should be happy memories with memories of bitterness.  And really, in the grand scheme of things, it's just money.  It comes and goes.  But your love will be forever!|`|NmsuIXd1aa	oh hell no. why should you pay his x for his kids. i would rethink marrying a man who you are taking care of. it seems that everytime you get ahead a little he is there spending money you both agreed on and now he has all these financial responsiblies bacause you saved for your wedding.|`|tluojTpSaa	i think yes, you are not understanding him at all.  I think he is feeling horrible for his lack of a job, and he is burdened by child support.<br>  If you really love him, don't you think you could say bye-bye to a big wedding?  Te wedding doesnt matter at all, i think.  Its the rest of yor lives together after that counts.  <br>  A lot of men feel this way in this bad economy.  Its hard! you need to talk to him, ask him how you can cut costs, maybe refund airfaires and have a civil ceremony, then use the wedding money for more practical things.<br>  Trust me, who cares about the wedding?  I think too many women do, and they end up divorced.<br>  good luck to both of you.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	You are not being selfish.  He his being ungrateful.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	you are being a sucker and he is taking advantage of you. why would he pay for the wedding when he knows that you will do it yourself? maybe you shouldn't be paying for the honeymoon before you pay for the wedding.
DhUMjZxtaa	I agree with you. <br>  <br>  I was lucky enough to actually find "the one" at such a young age (I'm only 22!) we've been together for 4 years now. (At the time I wasn't even looking for a boyfriend). Anyways, I'm still amazed at how far we have come and I can see myself spending the rest of my life with him. I know he's going to be a great father and husband. We have the same values and beliefs...I honestly think we're the same person, except I got stuck with the vagina and he got stuck with the penis lol|`|VeDJa0m9aa	sounds like you have a good head on  your shoulder by not rushing into a 'permanent' situation that you might regret later. Kudos for that. But as you said, there are plenty of fish. No need to 'settle' when it comes to such a dedicated decision. Please remember that the best treasures are found when you are not looking. Good luck...|`|5RhDnLHLaa	don't do anything with him if he broke up with you, if you broke up with him and he still won'ts you, marry him if you really think that much of him, if you know hes the one and you not going with him, you'lregretat it later, have fun with your dissensionen|`|bYU77eteaa	Well, thats how it usually works...|`|kTZevQNHaa	Many good parents are in romance-less marriages...and so I agree with you that that is an option...however, ultimately, I'd suggest not to throw in the  towel for the chance of true and everlasting compatible love just yet. You are young and there's maybe a guy there who'd be  both a good husband AND a good parent to your future kids...without having to fore go any important details of a good solid compatible marriage.|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	You already know that he isn't the one.  He hasn't met your expectations.  So, continue your journey and continue to meet as many people as you can, within reason.<br>  <br>  Define what you want and then get to work.  I had a friend tell me to write down everything I wanted in a sig other.  After I did that, I quit making excuses for myself, which is kind of what you're doing here.  Don't settle.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i think if you really don't find "the one" there is nothing wrong with settling for someone who you like and respect... but "five years time" is NOT the time to do that. wait until AT LEAST 30! what if you marry second best and then meet number one three years later? it would be heartbreaking. personally i will wait for the right one, as long as it takes.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Sorry I didn't read it all but I want to marry Robert Pattinson and if god forbid we don't get married then someone exactly like him. Actually no I will not settle for a look alike wannabe. I want the real thing damn it!!! ROBERT I'M COMING FOR YA YOU SMEXY THING YOU. xoxo <3|`|MiTklhkWaa	I want a husband and children too,i have always dreamed of that.If you love him and if he loves you and ask your hand!why not?<br>  But if you don't love him enough just let him go!!!|`|KiDq2xNiaa	under the circumstances I probably would still be dating him or engaged right now.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	in general, it normally works out for the better.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	My wife and I have a saying that we are each other's best friend.  And we use the term soul mate.<br>  <br>  But it wasn't easy finding her.  I didn't run into her until I was 32.  We immediately hit it off like old friends, one could almost complete a sentence started by the other one.<br>  <br>  I had been searching for a long time but never found my Ms. Right.  Girls my age, just didn't interest me.  I had grown up in a neighborhood where all the other kids were at least 8 years older than me - so I identified with older people.  I tended to go for older women.  But, I had a problem in than I looked at least  5 years younger than my age, so most of them would flirt but then back away (due to the age difference?). <br>  <br>  Funny little side story.  For several months, my boss had wanted to go to a beach music bar after work.  I finally brought the issue up in a staff meeting that we should go this Wednesday.  Usually, I would not go with the boss.  Anyway, about 6 of us went.  Place was so packed that once we got there we split up into about 3 groups of 2's.  I eventually found a empty table and took possession - and I later offerred a woman I saw walking around - a place to set (nearly all of the seats were taken).  She refused.  Fine with me, I had a table and there were other people walking around.  When she came around a 2nd time, I asked again - and again she refused.  When she came around a 3rd time, I asked her to save my table while I went and got a refill.  She did.  We got to talking, left the bar and went to a nearby restaurant and 12 months later got married.  Funny thing is, I only saw her walking thru the crowd that night.  No one else came by that I was interested in offerring a seat to.  And I would have stopped asking after 3 refusals.  <br>  <br>  We've now been married for over 24 years - she had 2 teenagers from a previous marriage when I met her.|`|JJLjo2QRaa	i know what you mean...i recently broke up with my boyfriend because i didn't feel that magic spark. what you should feel with the love of your life. i think that everyone wants to find that one person who you just know you cannot live without. if i were you, I'd wait. because one day you'll find "the one" and then you'll never regret breaking up with him. :)|`|5p2AiZLWaa	You could make a commitment, if you don't find someone by the time that you're thirty, you both could agree to spend your life together. Between now and then, you will have plenty of time to date and see how things go.|`|PlHjhwtAaa	i disagree, not to be mean or anything, but my opinion is that you should marry someone you truly love, not just to have kids. one day you will find someone better, you just have to keep looking|`|zoYhzucPaa	I think u are lucky to have found sumone so special so soon, but i would give it some time, and u are correct, u MIGHT find anouther "fish" in the sea.. Best of luck!|`|N6EGGQxsaa	i didnt read ur qeustiopn but i wolud say yes or no|`|2C3PKwD3aa	don't think to much about it. what happens happens.  don't be negative in saying that you wont find true love.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Infatuation passes, but friendship can last forever. Don't confuse love with infatuation.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I believe if your personality is not attracted to the opposite sex in that special way then you should not have children.  I also don't believe in outrageous fertility treatments, and I certainly don't think medical insurance should cover them.  <br>  <br>  If you are too shy , to insecure and too nonsexual" to attract someone then you should not have children.<br>  <br>  Children do not bring children closer.  They interferer in every aspect of a relationship. <br>  <br>  It should be the survival of the fittest.

He's made it this far in life being exactly the same person he's always been.  Tonight is no different.<br>  <br>  This is too much stress for a 14 year old.  Please google "child protective services" in your area and pick up the phone and talk to them.  They will help you figure out how to deal with this.  Your parents should NOT be causing you this kind of grief!  Talk to someone who can help, please.<br>  <br>  Good luck, dear.|`|UKWE0lHJaa	You need to relax and stay calm. Everything will work out. Try calling your mom or your grandparents.|`|enSoSKPQaa	You have to be calm. Try calling him and tell him that you're scared. Don't blame yourself for one, and protect yourself. Your moms gonna find out sooner or later, so try calling him and get ur parents to sort it out themselves. It's not your job!|`|swAONFfEaa	when your mom gets home let her know about your concern and try calling your dad and telling him that you love him (its always good to let people know you care) and after that, all you can really do is pray for him.|`|UWx1beYtaa	Have you tried calling him? Maybe if you do you can tell him that your worried.
9UQlhzitaa	to start with let me say Hello<br>  <br>  more like lust is what drives a man for more sex;some people can not get enough because they are not satisfied with what they already have so since it is of little value in their minds they need something or one that gives them value(the wife and i have been together say 2 years but i don't get the touches from like when we first started dating or conformation that i'm the man she still loves so i fall in lust with someone who fills the gap in my ego that she is not; now here is the kicker i don't know i have the need until it is fulfilled because i think everything is all good.<br>  <br>  not ruining a good thing takes 2 just as it did to make it a good thing to start with;most guys are not heartless or cold but we don't see the world the same way you do.(case in point a young lady i was dating as a friend became much more than that to each other and when she was saying that she can only love this way; i was thinking and trying to explain that i was in love with her but i wanted her to know what a friends love felt like first) now she is with her x and if all goes well will be married soon. So who is at fault no one is she had a change of heart that was all<br>  <br>  the same thing that goes on in that multi task oriented brain of yours<br>  <br>  who says they are happy?? most of us wear masks so the world has no idea what is going on in our day today lives.but too answer your question directly  we get carried away with what is happening right now and don't stop to think how is this going to effect me tommorrow<br>  <br>  there are some of us who do take the time to think before we act;normally we are the ones who have been burned by the women you have described for us men<br>  <br>  hope you understand us just a little better now|`|s0qrPl5saa	Not all men are like that, please don't stereotype :)<br>  All I can think of is wanting more, not being satisfied etc, but also wanting to be comfortable in the knowledge that if a marriage broke down he'd be able to get another girlfriend or something?<br>  <br>  Its all based around insecurities. Make us realise what it is that we actually have once in a while so that it stays appreciated?|`|Zqby1cXpaa	well all men aren't like that and don't forget it's not only some men that are like that it's some women to, depends on the person in the end we would all be the same except for our personalities an some body parts|`|ehm3vCYXaa	It sounds totally cliche but the grass is always greener on the other side at least that's the way it seems anyway.|`|AA10923249	Some do it for the thrill, some to look good for the fellows, for some it boosts their ego, some are just you know whats. Some men are never happy with one woman/wife.|`|Gd8lhSVOaa	NOT ALL GUYS ARE LIKE THAT.... I SERIOUSLY FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT YOU THINK ALL Men are like that.|`|91b03994130639fdf72c896eef54054aaa	i'm not like that : )  i promise<br>  <br>  those guys are what we call douche bags......|`|abJFBd7daa	It's because woman allow it. Really. Today we live in a world where everything is at our fingertips. Celphones keep us mobil and from having to find a payphone. Homemakers rarely have to spend hours in the kitchen prepairing meals. Take it out of the box or bag, throw it on a cookie sheet or in a pot and the main entree is ready in 45 min (20 if you can use the microwave). No more traveling 5 minutes this way and 15 minutes that way to find just the right footwear. Conveinence means we can get it fast and with little extra effort.<br>  Then there's the girl looking for the right guy who delivers himself to her and inside of 90 days they've slept together. Inside of a year there getting married or expecting a child. 2 and a half years and they can get there divorced just as fast. Woman have more power over men than they know and you all shoot yourself in the foot because you are all so damn competitive with one another it causes you to do things you might not normally do and your afraid that good serious men can be caught in the same time it takes to make dinner. That's not to say good men have been caught quickly but there are many examples where a woman will admit; she didn't know that about him and it's all because she was afraid to loose something that in the end, she never had. Ladies, men aren't shoes and their not something to be prepaired in 45 minutes. (Even though we can be ready in half that time) Good men respect a good thing and will fight to keep it. Those looking to score a better deal will only disappoint you if you let them.|`|izXIAxXGaa	Do you really want to know what this sounds like? Consider a guy saying this to you . . .<br>  i know you women out there are only interested in gold digging for money. You don't care about love. You will sleep with any guy that has the most money and do anything to crawl your way to the top. <br>  It's clearly obvious that women take advantage of men's sex drives to suit their own agenda whether it is money, power, revenge. <br>  Women are cold heartless creatures. How many abortions have been committed this year? Do men make that choice? <br>  <br>  You know what, you are absolutely right. Why not marry Jesus (the only perfect man) and become a nun?<br>  <br>  I will leave you with a quote from Jesus<br>  Let the person who is without sin, caste the first stone at the adulterer.<br>  (Is that a rock you have stashed in your skirt pocket? Should I duck?)|`|JThgHiaoaa	We aren't all like that... Please don't just 50% of the population on your experiences with 1 guy.<br>  <br>  Also, please note that a lot of females also cheat. I believe people do it for the thrill of doing something they aren't supposed to... Same sort of reason people Speed, Take Drugs and Steal.|`|NBEuxzDBaa	I would never  EVER EVER because a good girl is hard to come by<br>  I would treat her like a queen
ze7xiJwTaa	Dude. That doesn't sound good. Obviously I don't know the details, but if your husband raped you under ANY circumstances or is abusive in any way, then no, you should get away from him. And get help, please. He will continue to abuse you if you let him.|`|AA11476782	No and these people are really moronic if they don't think that a man can rape his wife!  Of course he can.  The places that don't have rape laws against husbands are those where the wife is considered his property.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	how does a husband rape his wife? i don't understand it. why rape someone that should be giving it up to him without a fight?|`|9yurQ85Eaa	OMG you need to get out of that relationship right now. You should have turned him in for that.|`|xkGfxn70aa	how do you rape someone if they are married UNLESS your in a abusive relationship.  If he has raped you then you need to get away from him ASAP.  That means he has no respect for your feelings. Get out before he does more harm to you.  There cannot be trust there either, you've got to scared to death. Exactly he may kill you next.  I would certainly get the h**l away from him..|`|xD3g4wsqaa	I've been raped, but I never wanted to see them again. I wanted to get them all and kill them, But I would be raped again. So To answer you question. NOOOOOOOOOOOO I even left the city.|`|v2a220YWaa	opps, I answered your question to someone else, go to 27 and high sex drive to get my answer, sorry|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	no ,trust and safety are high on my list of needs in a relationship with out that I would be out of there ..|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	well,,,,,,,, in some countries, they don't even have a rape term for a husband, you know.|`|yvRrvSyPaa	GOSH NO!|`|U5NQSmDFaa	Dude, are you serious! do you want him to drug you again???<br>  <br>  huh?<br>  jeez ur messed up!|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Depends what your definition of rape is. Was he just a little rough or did he actually have it rough and not stop when you said no? I don't see why a married person should have to "rape" their spouse... you should want to give it freely to each other if you love each other...|`|GQUaFGHLaa	No. The person that your married to should not rape you and you should get divorced. My friend was raped by her husband and she walked out and left everything and got divorced. She ended up pregnant.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	its a grief process that requires time, and there is no easy way out of the pain. u could join a therapy group, where u would meet others who have already been in your shoes, who would act as a support system. its not something u do on your own, requires friends, and being bale to talk out your grief. also don't leave god out of it either, or prayer. if it just happened it is going to hurt. and understand we don't control anything that happens, we can only control our self.|`|naequcqlaa	I can imagine how you feel, but I don't see how you can do anything to change this situation.  The only thing you can do is accept this face regardless of how hard it is.  Once you've accepted it, you'll have to put it in your past & start a new beginning,  Know that you CAN go on, that you w/be OK even tho you're hurting at the moment.  We are a lot stronger than we even think we are,  Just know that this too shall pass.  That eventually you will get better.  I'm a firm believer that things do happen for a reason, even tho at the moment we don't know what that reason is.  All along this just might not have been the rite person for you even tho you tho't so.  When the absolute rite person comes along, you'll know for SURE & this time you w/NOT loose him.  Give yourself a chance to heal, then you w/be able to search for the rite one for you.  You can be happy too that you didn't marry him.Try your best to surround yourself w/those who love & care about you.  They w/give you the love & support you need,  Just know in the end that you w/be happy again, you w/find just the rite person for you.  You just didn't find him yet, you will.  Best to you...:)|`|29hcn9JRaa	You just take things one day at a time, trust me I have been in your situation and it is no fun, however ya gotta keep it simple, simplicity is the remedy for any kinda heart ache, as looking at the big picture, the future is a major no, no, because this is when you become overwhelmed, and getting overwhelmed is what happens when you future trip, always keep things on a hour to hour basis then day to day. It does begin to get better, after a few weeks you begin to accept life as it is.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	Honestly...you probably already know this, but only time will really do the trick. In the meantime, try to cut off all contact with him if you can. Having it in your face just makes it harder and drags out the 'moving on' part. Get out, get interested in other things. Try dating. I know you know all that, but sometimes it's good to hear it from others (at least that's true for me). You deserve someone who wants to be with you the same way you do, and he's out there! You can't meet Mr. Right if you're pining over Mr. Wrong.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	Go outside, talk with friends, walk around the park. The faster you learn to move on the less youll need to worry about copping with it|`|3keA0Rtnaa	go beat him up...It'd make me feel better|`|4ykgt6rBaa	It's hard but you know what it has to hurt to get better and over time you will realize that he wasn't worth your tears.  Just focus on keeping you together don't jump into a rebound relationship right now because they  never work.  Just take some time to get yourself together and believe me before you know it you will be alright.

She's an adult now, so why not celebrate and memorialize her childhood? Like a graduation.<br>  <br>  Make it like a gift basket, if you guys gave each other makeovers, get her favorite makeup, if you played a certain game, get her that, if you have any inside jokes, get her something that will remind her of that too and put it all in a kit. My sister and I used to collect snow-globes, so I got her one of those that looked just like the one she liked most.<br>  <br>  It sounds cheesy but I think she'll appreciate it more than money or a gift card. Those things are nice to have but mean nothing.|`|YivvRfEMaa	I say go to a department store, they have tons of sale right now and you can find her a good girft for 150 or less. I think maybe you should go for a purse, girls love purse and also it's not like shoes which sometimes do not fit, or clothes wich can have the same problem. Or maybe a perfume. and thatll be cheaper than 150 and you can probably get the giftdeals that comes with free stuff...Anyways good luck : )|`|YJH5YcjBaa	im 18 and even if people say they like it when someone buys them something instead of money , thats a huge LIE....just trying to be nice<br>  <br>  <br>  i say 150.oo is more than enough but give it as a prepaid visa cardor gift card to her fav store .,.....i love pac sun...very cute stuff that many 18 yr olds wear|`|ou3wQcuYaa	You could get her a nice bracelet? or you could get her something cheeper that is a personal joke between you two.|`|I2gs5opxaa	somthing nice|`|6IjMSmhRaa	get her a girft card or money
NeTNnvSZaa	Bingo!  He's not taking responsibility for his actions.  If he didn't know the kids had school vacations that isn't your fault.  Does he have no memory of going to school?  Ridiculous!  The kids would have told him.<br>  <br>  My ex does the same thing until I shamed him into realizing it was not my responsibility to ensure he was proactive in his child life.<br>  <br>  Also if you have a copy of your divorce you should read it, these things are usually spelled out.<br>  <br>  I would let him have all the time he wants if you're comfortable.

If we simply take what you claim as truth, then it can be either one or two things going on in his head and heart, one thing that is a common and unfortunate behavior that happens to some fathers who get divorced is they no longer feel as valued or needed anymore, which of course is simply wrong, as this is the time when he is needed more so then ever, however many men fail to get this, and simply carry on and just accept the idea that they are part time fathers, the other thing that may be going on is he simply isn't interested in being a hands on dad, their is a difference between being a father and being a dad, a dad is someone who will beg, cry, scream, do whatever it takes to see his children, a dad is someone who will take you to court to ensure that he gets quality time with his children, he will do just about anything to spend time with his kid's, so it is quite possible that your ex is simply just a father? Whatever the case, this is a perfect example of what happens to family's across the board who have children then get divorced, and this is why it is so important for many couples who are thinking about having children to make darn sure that the person their having children with is the person that they really like, and I use the term like, because love in marriages is over rated, but if you like your spouse and you enjoy their company & can see yourself with this person for the rest of your life, then have children, but having children then splitting up is so hard for children, they are the people who always get caught in the middle. I do hope that you and your ex can work things out, as these children of yours deserve two parents who are both interested in spending time with them not when it is convienient or when they can fit it into their schedules, as nothing should be more important then spending time with your children.|`|hNSZlSMPaa	For pity sake, don't let him yank your chain. He is saying it is your fault?  Don't even bother replying to that stupidity. He is trying to make you look bad to the children. If he wants more time it is his place to ask for it. You already know how these absent fathers can 'forget' that they even have kids after a divorce.  I do.

asTtNyTxaa	You have two choices: become his girlfriend OR don't become his girl. <br>  Easy, stop the drama.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you tell him that you don't want a relationship, that you like him a lot but you are too young to tie yourself down to just one person right now.<br>  <br>  tell him you'd like for things to continue as they are.<br>  <br>  If that's alright with him, then you're golden.  If it's not then he'll back off and probably date other girls.<br>  <br>  you can't always have it both ways.  at some point you have to decide which you want more:  a relationship with the person you're with or your freedom to explore other possibilities.<br>  <br>  FWIW:  I do agree with you that you really shouldn't tie yourself down just yet.  and if you don't feel you are ready for a relationship then don't enter into one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Well, u cannot lead him on, just tell him that as much as you like him you are not interested in a relationship and you want to remain friends because you care about him but not ready for a commitment!|`|AA10834046	Just leave things as they are.  Let him know how you feel about him, but that for right now, you are not willing to commit to anything.  All that may change at any moment.  Just stay in communication with him.  He might be happy to have things the way they are.|`|15a781a97ff5a5a5c3b8cb8d0530d63caa	Wow. Thats crazy. Im in the same situation. I have absolutely no idea how to deal with this either, but I understand your dilemma|`|AA12022610	tell him how you feel|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Tell him the truth; that you enjoy his company but hate labels and "relationships", so he shouldn't plan on ever calling you his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  If he wants a girlfriend, and you refuse to be one, though, be prepared for another girl to take that place with him; you may be able to still hang out and be friends, but don't expect to stay #1 in his life unless you can give him what he needs in a relationship, too.  If that thought drives you nuts, then either you're possessive, or you really do want the commitment but something else about it is bothering you.  Remember, someone won't commit to you if you won't commit to them.|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	look up commitment and learn more about it and try to get yourself tyo do it and in the meantime you could just say to the guy that i need a couple of days alone right now to think staright and i will tell you about where we can go- good luck!!|`|91AMtKEraa	You just want bang bang bang|`|QczEdd5qaa	Over come your fear<br>  <br>  just try it out if you really like him|`|uLHtXibRaa	You cant use a man...|`|brVj9ktDaa	dont go out with jim though|`|DKuly5cBaa	stop lying to ur soul and move on|`|03d02ccfb35b78c46d0906cedf98349daa	trust me, I thought I had commitment issues too. It's not because you're a commitment phobe, it's because you're really not that into him. When you do find someone you truly like, you WILL want the label of girlfriend. Don't waste your time TRYING to like him, because you'll eventually break up with him. Just wait until you find someone you actually want considered your boyfriend instead of staying with this guy, then ditching him when someone better comes along|`|pHEIxQoBaa	if this thing is just for fun, and you feel like it wont get any more serious, then tell him that you like him, and that youd like to continue seeing him and hanging out with him, but that you don't want to be in a committed relationship.<br>  <br>  if you DO feel like you could really get close to this guy, and that eventually his attention is the only that you want, then go for it.<br>  you can always break up with him later (that sounds bad... ha).<br>  <br>  <br>  maybe you should look more at why you dont like committment. is it just because you don't want to be a "girl friend"? or is it because youre afraid of getting close with someone?|`|7PDJFv0kaa	Just face it, you are his girlfriend. You have a relationship, you just don't call it that yet. I think you need to take a chance and be with him. You really like him, and you're 17. You're never going to be able to commit if you don't take a chance. It sounds like you really love him. Don't be nervous about it.|`|utOVoGo3aa	Tell him this, you know, that you like him but you dont want to be in a relationship. He will tell you if wants to be with you or not and you guys go from there. I dont know why you dont want to be in a relationship but if you like this guy then maybe you should. Dont worry about messing up your friendship because usually they dont mess up anything, if you do break up with him leave him with a good tone so he knows that you still like as a friend.|`|jY7lt3jkaa	"I don't really want to lose what we have but I don't know if I want a committment either"<br>  <br>  ^^ say that! he'll get it. you'll eventually warm up to the idea of being boyfriend and girlfriend. i mean, if you're gonna get married some day you need to start having boyfriends!|`|GdjyHBTzaa	be honest to yourself<br>  maybe your love to him is only like a friendship<br>  its only your ego that you dont want to lose him either because you know he loves you and wants you as  his girlfriend<br>  or else perhaps you love him but still dont realize it?<br>  but for 17 years old many things can still happen..so take it easssssyyyy|`|z58NVkOnaa	You are going against human nature...it is not normal for us to be isolated...when you mix a male & female together...our internal needs for companion is there...do not expect a risk free understanding without someone still getting hurt...for where the heart is, pain is there too...for you to have expectation like yours, is like having sex, and not wanting the thought of getting pregnant.|`|VJbubJVxaa	honestly, you just don't know what you want yet. So the best thing to do is just tell him you need time because even if you guys get into a relationship, it probably won't be the same as now.|`|V6U9LscSaa	if ur first instinct was to nott get into a relationship with him, then you really dont like him enough to be in one, usually if u really  really like him you would jump at the chance, ur just not that into him|`|RXQmmco2aa	You can either be friends with benefits, or I think you should just try going out.. maybe a secret relation ship for a while and see how it goes and see if you'll like it.. Tell him that too|`|zTBscfuraa	srry if this dosnt help but he sounds like a great guy andd i think you should get over it and just say ur boyfriend girlfriend already you are basicley all ready going out and yuu defenently dont want to lose him|`|tuendbBeaa	all or none hun. Even us guys hate drama. Which is what "Friends with Benefits" always is. Start a relationship with the guy or just be friends. No middle ground.|`|zxRkdozwaa	talk to him about it maybe|`|Zqby1cXpaa	ask him what he thinks about friends w/ benefits|`|EfDsqm4faa	try the relationship once u may like it.|`|OuCUBiF3aa	let him know how u feel|`|aOFsYynBaa	You need to ask yourself why you don't want a commitment. You're 17, you've got a lot of life ahead of you. However, there really isn't anything wrong with a commitment. If you're afraid of it, that's something you will have to get over, if this guy is worth you giving your heart and soul to him. That is what every relationship needs to be, otherwise they don't work. So if you have reservations about commitment, don't worry, it doesn't really change anything. Unless you sleep around a lot... nothing will change, and if they do, it well only be for the better.|`|WDsZS0ORaa	If you like him enough and if you think hes worth it, give a relationship a chance. Tell him your going to try a realtionship with him and tell him not to get frustarted with you if things go bad. If things do go bad tell him you aren't ready for a relationship and you liked things the way they were before. <br>  <br>  Just try it out, you may surprise yourself. As Always- Love Doctor <3|`|Sss6wlZFaa	it sounds like you just keep taking and wont give anything in return... he does things for you and is sweet to you, so its no wonder he's going to start to be attached to you.<br>  What would be the big deal with just becoming his gf? it doesnt mean it'll last forever, but at least you can try it out, and it'll make him happy as well as you.<br>  <br>  It's unfair to keep letting him act like your boyfriend and do boyfriend things for you, but not let him be able to call you his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  seriously give it a go... it wont be that bad!
KgyAAwQ0aa	1) 6in is good but just make sure u use it properly<br>  2) i like bein thrusted and a really big outburst in the end. that really gets me going|`|gtDg845naa	I think 7.5 inch is perfect, and I prefer length over width.  <br>  <br>  From experience, the guy could be 2 inches or 12 inches, the first time sucks.  It won't get good until about the third or fourth time.  <br>  <br>  Steady is the way to go for us girls.  Which can be a problem because some guys don't have the best stamina, and they can't maintain a single position long enough for us to orgasm before them. <br>  <br>  Use a Condom!|`|jfiF9XIUaa	i actually had sex with someone that was 6 in and i enjoyed him better then the 9 in guy so size doesnt matter just make sure you hit them walls lol and she will love it|`|hH76CdQ1aa	its an okay size. tip: start slow, then gradually get faster and faster.|`|kcGL2sFoaa	1.) You're average. The trick to being above average is knowing how to use it.<br>  <br>  2.) If you do it properly all the parts are good. Slow build ups are my favourite, especially when they end in fast explosions.<br>  <br>  Best of luck there dear.|`|gU3RHWKCaa	That's an average sized penis.  foreplay is important.

dbQHlp85aa	I've never been with an extremely jealous person... but my fiance seems to be a little jealous.. nothing crazy annoying like your guy but I can tell when something bothers him and we talk about it. <br>  <br>  He makes snide comments about my guy friends even though I hardly talk to them anymore (we've lost touch over the years). But I know it's only because he's insecure about himself. <br>  <br>  If i were you I would say: "What do you want me to do, love? Do you want me to sop talking to him so we can have one of those relationships where you control every move I make? Is that what you want?"<br>  <br>  And he will see how ridiculous that sounds and settle down enough to have a normal conversation about it. <br>  <br>  If he says, "Yes, that's exactly what I want" then you need to roll out. <br>  <br>  Ask him what it is about your friendship with this dude that bothers him so much and all of the sudden and then talk about it.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	guys get super jealous; its in their nature i suppose 8-)<br>  reassure that you love him from time to time, and if you guys haven't  said "i love you" yet, now would be a good time. if this jealousy continues, it might be time for a change..<br>  and know taht you are free to talk to whoever you feel :)|`|MYbRICxqaa	Your boyfriend look as if he is going to continue to be jealous. I do not think you can change that about him.

Relationships are built on trust, so tell him if he doesnt start trusting you, the relationship will break! Point out examples in which you have trusted him. Good luck xo|`|RH7K4rsmaa	Obviously your man has his guard up about this guy. Not much else you can do except reassure him that you are only interested in one man.

MXMMlSJPaa	Yes I do believe that love never loses Hope But Always believe in the promises of love no matter how long the time and how far the distance.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	It really depends on the people, but yes I do believe in them. Now, I think if a relationship starts out as long distance, it doesn't stand much of a chance. However, if it's a strong relationship and then the two are separated for some reason for a long period of time (ex: college, work, military, etc), then there's a very strong chance it will survive. I do not think that strictly Internet relationships are successful though. Good luck, hope I helped.|`|Ofh5zBanaa	I believe in it and have tried it myself a time or two, but trust me man. The lack of physical contact cannot be madeup for.  Even if you all do talk ALL the time.  Its really just something i don't think a couple can go without.  and i think that right there is what lead 2 the end of my long distance relationships.  So hey man give it a try if your really that into her, but I'd say don't be surprised when it just really doesn't work out.|`|UtAYobFaaa	Im my opinion yes they can depends on the couple i long distance dated my fiance for a year and now were in the same town as each other its really hard to do because it hurts being away but if you really do love the person or want to be with them its worth it and they will work if your both loyal to each other and want it to work|`|kNcqw6Tlaa	well...mine didn't start out as one. i met my boyfriend in high school and got really close. after graduation i went to school 2 hours away, he went to school locally. two years later we are still in love. we plan to get married.  long distance relationships can only work if both people love each other and trust each other. we never fight and we still get to see each other a bit. we talk on the phone every night.  <br>  <br>  i know for many people ldr's don't work out, but i am proof that it can work if love and trust is present|`|2by2Ujblaa	I'd say it can work, especially if you knew this person for a while in person and say one of you had to move away, you just have to be very dedicated and know that this person is worth it.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	i personally wouldn't be in one but every relationship is different.<br>  <br>  what works in your relationship might not work in everybody elses.|`|cZyeJ2praa	nooooooooooooooooooo|`|uAzToWC7aa	no, the person can be doing things behind your back,and you cant see each other frequently, and you dont have a true relationship|`|qYTYcVGGaa	no. these are the problems:<br>  -no physical contact, or little<br>  -cheating<br>  -not a fullfilled relationship|`|V6MdE2mDaa	Yes, it true.<br>  <br>  But the problem is you wont be able to see eachother in person, and talk F2F.

Was it warranted?<br>  6)  Why is this separation occuring?  Is it voluntary or mutual?<br>  7)  And most importantly:  Do YOU believe in LDRs?

My boyfriend and I get weary after not seeing eachother for a day, but never seeing eachother would be a total nightmare. I don't believe in it because long distance relationships have never worked out for me and I hope you agree. I mean, yeah it's really nice to have a person who cares for you so much just by talking to you but I tried to keep this relationship with my friend who lived in England and It was just terrible. After a while it got harder on us to keep talking and after a while I lost trust in him because he did start to appeal to other girls and make me feel horrible about living in America and still wanting to see him. I haven't talked to him in 4 months now.|`|SDjHVnALaa	No do not do long distance relationship because u can never see your partner and you'll never know what thier doing with someone else. Only do this when you've known th person for a really long time and he/she never lied about anything big. Even though trust is needed in a relationship you'll go crazy about what thier doing with someone else even though you have trust on them cause yu can never be really sure bout what thier doing. I've been on this road before its not pretty this is just my opinion.|`|TkS3ttSvaa	I think that it can work, if the couple is truly committed to each other. My boyfriend and I are going to have to try it. We currently live together in Japan, and he will move to Thailand soon to work for 3 years. I'll be going back to the states this spring for school. I'm only going for my associate's degree first, and it will take me 2 years, at the most. He'll visit as much as possible, and I'll live with him during my summer's off and in Thailand with him when I'm done, but it'll still be hard. I think it can work though, as long as we remain fully committed to each other.|`|81HtN2nlaa	Well Yes and No <br>  It all depends how you feel about the person if you can trust them and you are not the jealous type it can work out but people tend to get jealous and become suspcious of their partner and this can ruin a realtionship.|`|JMdXd3ZZaa	Well, I was in a serious relationship, but it was long distance...and well, it never works out because you just love that person so much...and it tears you apart because you can't physically be with them to talk to them, have fun with them, just generally be with them.  So no.|`|utOVoGo3aa	it depends, if you talk on the phone and chat then yes, its ok. You can always meet the person and see them, so there is no problem. If you Love the person then hell ya! long distance relationships are cool. My dad met a woman on the internet and she lived some where else. Now they are married and they live TOGETHER in a nice home, Life is good.|`|m84Ml3Opaa	Its hard to say. If you and the other person are committed to making it work I think anythings possible. My brother met his wife over the computer and they stayed 2 states apart. Year or so later he went out to see her and eventually moved out there with her. So it all depends on the people.|`|QsVNllcraa	TOTALLY, if you really love, you can make it work no matter the distance, just knowing that one day you'll be together, makes a world of difference.|`|ROl9Dhqjaa	I think that you need to be around the person in order to have a healthy relationship. But if you love and trust the person then i think you could handle a long distance relationship.|`|f5kZwH2Laa	if your mature enough to handle it and you should have a lot of trust in the other person then yeah it could be a really strong thing. the time you have together will be really appreciated but it gets frustrating sometimes when they aren't there|`|HW9aOy38aa	i think if you are old enough and mature enough to handle it, but not if you met them in cyberspace. then no.<br>  you should have met them in person a few times at least, and talk to them every day, and not just on the internet.|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Yes, don't forget that you can communicate with the other party through phone or email and can see each other through computer's monitor.If you have trust and love each other, it will last for ever.Have more confident with yourself.|`|m9zviqlzaa	most long distance relationships don't work. I have a few friends who have had successful long distance relationships. it all depends on how much work you put into the relationship.|`|CX0y66Puaa	Yes, that way you can do whatever the hell you want and theres less chance in the other person knowing....But in saying that they could be doing the same :P so yes and no|`|e6sOaOm5aa	it depends do you really love they guy/girl <br>  and also have you ever met them if it is just like a eharmony or facebook thing i dont think so i thing you could make it work|`|jfiF9XIUaa	no they dont work unless you have been with that person for a long time before the long distance and depending on how long the long distance is going to be.|`|bCav3MIXaa	ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

iBJmQ7MWaa	yeah i think you can like being with someone but usually that is when you are with "The One" then everything jus feels simple and easy and it doesnt feel like work. It starts to feel like work sometimes when one person is jus so much wrong and the other is always complaining or   that kinda thing. Sooo good sex will feel like effort when that person is not used to doing that kind of thing so the other person feels they need to change this persons ways and that now feels like an effort. But in other ways good sex with the right person will not feel like an effort cause ur willing to please em and take them to the top and what not, so oprah is kinda wrong in a way.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Well there is a certain technique that results in more powerful climaxes.

It's not that people can't get off without putting some effort into it, believe me, they can. However, it can be so much better if you do different positions that are a little more complicated. Also, someone is going to be exerting effort. You can't both just be still and expect it to be great. The harder and faster it is, the better it is (sometimes). That's the best way I can think to explain it.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Why anyone listens to anything Oprah says is beyond me.|`|yhsi0sWzaa	the sex I have is always good.|`|xlbMRcesaa	lol good point some ppl really have no lives.
2o3BHgCCaa	You will probably need 4-7 meters for a full length dress depending what style you have it (pleats, poofy, layers etc will be at the higher end).<br>  As everyone said spotlight is good. Also try lincraft.<br>  You might also want to look into specialty fabric stores. If you are in Perth you might like to try Fabulous Fabrics in balcatta. they have an amazing range of bridal fabrics. $10-12 per meter is quite cheap for good quality fabrics, but they can be found. I found bridal satin in heaps of colours at that fabulous fabrics for $14p/m.<br>  Try specialty stores, they are your best bet, or shop at spotlight when they have their 50% off days.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	you will want 3-4m per dress depending on the style and size AND the layout for the cut - you want it to fall nice then it needs to be cut on the bias - this takes extra material<br>  <br>  $10-$12 is NOT alot - trakkie dak material is about that price<br>  go have a look in a Spotlight.<br>  <br>  If you live in Sydney - go to Cabramatta you will get cheaper fabric but you will be looking at $20-30 per metre<br>  <br>  I would suggest HIRE the dresses if your looking for cheap and cheerful|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Hey ummmm its all really different, depending on what sizes ur bmaids are the sizes will differ, its best if you go to like  material shops and get patterns of the dresses and have a look to see how much you need or look it up online.<br>  Spotlight is great for material and cheap and also for dress patterns they have a huge range!!<br>  <br>  It may end up cheaper to buy them because once you buy the material, then the zips and cotton etc, you could be look at about $100 per dress, where as like me i brought my dresses of a seller in Bejjing, they where $75 each and that included postage.<br>  the link to a really nice dress for $80.00 is:<br>  <a href="http://www.lightinthebox.com/A-line-Strapless-Floor-length-Satin-Bridesmaid-Dress---Prom-Dress--HSX118-_p24104.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightinthebox.com/A-line-Stra...</a><br>  <br>  if you buy more than 3 i think you get good discount, i had 3 bmaids and i brought the first one to make sure i liked the dress and then i brought the other two, i loved my bmaids dresses. these are them here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lightinthebox.com/A-line-Strapless-Ankle-length-Satin-Evening-Dress---Prom-Dress--HSX219-_p24732.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightinthebox.com/A-line-Stra...</a><br>  <br>  and if you go right down the bottom you will see mine and another persons feedback for them, i was really stoked with the dresses, and they where cheap also!!<br>  <br>  Goodluck!<br>  <br>  ALSO i forgot to mention, they make the dresses to your exact size, also they do wedding dresses, i brought my dress of them also.

u0udwkZQaa	First off, let me say good luck finding a young teenager that doesn't just want sex. As long as you can attract him, you only need to worry about turn offs, because he will pretty much always be "ready", and if he's not, it won't take more than a raunchy pic, seductive soft voice, or sexy outfit.<br>  <br>  Turn offs:<br>  <br>  acting needy/clingy --he will run a mile no matter how attracted.<br>  hanging around a lot of guys, or, hanging round them much more than girls<br>  always wanting to talk about feelings<br>  being too emotional <br>  getting drunk when he's sober, or, being a bad drunk<br>  bad language/bitching<br>  bad hygiene/untidy<br>  bad manners<br>  smoking<br>  being too loud<br>  body hair<br>  bad reputation<br>  unflattering clothes<br>  badly conditioned hair, the kind that looks rough.<br>  showing too much flesh<br>  wearing clothes that are too small and create bulges and spill outs/overs<br>  being mean/rude/arrogant<br>  being a user|`|BhQSTvLsaa	All teenage boys want sex.

ngz4s4VVaa	I dont think theres anything wrong with you. I get the same way, Im very emotional but sometimes I cant cry, it feels physically impossible. I think its because after you cry for so long, you feel numb, and if you cant feel, you cant cry. But if you can feel, and you need to cry, try listening to some sad music, yes its depressing but its an amazing depressing, this music is phenominal. It feels sooo good to cry if you havent in a while and need to. So try listening to these 10 songs, SERIOUSLY listen to them! Im trying to help! --<br>  <br>  (its the song name, then artist name)<br>  <br>  1 Your not sorry - Taylor Swift<br>  2 Hawaii - Meiko<br>  3 I caught myself - Paramore<br>  4 Signs - Bloc Party<br>  5 Eyes on Fire - Blue foundation<br>  6 We have a map of the piano - Mum<br>  7 All I need - Radiohead<br>  8 Blind - Mega Bass<br>  9 Warning Sign - Coldplay<br>  10 Lemon - Katy Rose<br>  <br>  SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO ALL, ALL, ALL OF THOSE.

ZZZZZZ|`|0jw5j5aLaa	I think you should go to the wedding.  I don't know, to me, a wedding ranks a little higher than a graduation.  Tough call though.  But you ARE a bridesmaid.  You are part of that wedding, you'll be in all the photos, and you'll always be remembered as a part of that day.  At the graduation, on the other hand, you're just a spectator.<br>  <br>  You could try to do both.  If possible, with another driver to switch off with, as you'll be dead tired.  But if you can't make the actual graduation ceremony, is your family having a party or get-together of any sort afterwards that you could make?  If not, maybe you should suggest it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|n3Agaj6naa	it would be good if you could attend both, but I don't know if you would thoroughly enjoy either one.<br>  <br>  Is your sisters graduation very important to her?  If I had to, I would skip the convocation ceremony.  I'm sure there will be an after party that you could attend, many people don't care as much about the ceremony because in reality she will only be up for a minute or two, and there will probably be another 200 people graduating that morning.<br>  <br>  I'm graduating from Architecture this May as well, and it definitely doesn't mean a lot to me whether or not people come to the ceremony.  I've invited people, because I think it might be fun, and I'd like to arrange a celebration afterwards, but I won't be at all offended when people RSVP no.  If someone had to choose between my convocation or their best friends wedding (as a BM) I would tell them to go to the wedding.<br>  <br>  Talk to your sister and see how much she really cares about it.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	I think it depends on your relationship with them. Are you closer to your sister, or your friend? Who is more likely to be okay with you missing their event?<br>  <br>  You can still celebrate with both of them after the fact.<br>  If you can haul *** and be at both, do so.<br>  <br>  Though I'd personally go to my sister's grad, because grad is more of an achievement, wheras wedding is just a party.|`|QBRPza93aa	That's tough.. and I'm sure whatever you decide will be the right thing to do for you, your sister, AND your friend...<br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd go to the wedding and ask a friend to drive you or go with you to the graduation. That way if you drive someone will be able to keep you up and not fall asleep while driving.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Not tryin to sound pessimistic but ALWAYS sister first! Specially cause she went through school on her own! You can always visit with the newlyweds and see pics later, besides she is your BFF she will want you to be at your sisters grad. besides....divorce rates are going up! and college is super important!|`|xJykwDO6aa	ouchh. tough place to be. i would be very angry if my sister didn't show to my graduation. but i think i wouldn't be as mad if my bff had somewhere to go...depends on who's more reasonable.|`|n2mumPsYaa	II am not sure if that is the correct answer. I would be careful before I went with that one|`|RPhla0R7aa	Your sister should come first but if you can do both go for it!|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Go to both, they are both very important!!|`|76nTvO4iaa	I think you should try to make both of them.<br>  <br>  What do airline connections look like between the two places?<br>  <br>  Do you know anyone with a private plane who would do you a MAJOR favor and get you from the graduation town to the wedding town?<br>  <br>  If you call the local airport where your sis is in school, they might be able to recommend someone who needs some flight hours and would take you up there for the price of the fuel.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kHEFi3ttaa	If you think  you can handle it do both. Other wise go to your sisters graduation. Family is forever, friends will come and go (even a best friend). Your sister would probably be sore at you  for not making it to her graduation.  How would you feel if roles were reversed and she missed your graduation for a friend's wedding?|`|l43NSgHyaa	Do Both!!!!   <br>  <br>  Your friend's wedding and your sister's graduation from law school are equally important milestones in each of their lives.   You should be there for both!!    <br>  <br>  I say haul @ss to your sister's graduation, after being a bridesmaid.  It's going to be chaotic.  But, in the end, you'll be glad you were there for each event.|`|PBdPD748aa	if i had to choose i would go to the wedding.... getting married is the most important day of your life and it is the most memorable... and considering its your best friend im sure you have both been through a lot together and are very close....<br>  <br>  yes a graduation is important but sorry it doesnt measure up to the importance of a wedding!|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	Sorry but if it was my sister i would go to the wedding. we have a great relationship but were both raised to honour our commitments. you have commited to be in that wedding.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	if you can make both, do it!|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	Well, if you committed to be in the wedding before you knew about your sister's graduation, then you really should honor the commitment you made to your friend.  Your friend will be seriously unhappy with you if you bail out on her wedding now.  From the way I see it, the only way you can be at both is if you drive all night after the wedding and reception to make it to your sister's law school commencement by 10 am.  I doubt your mother would want you doing that, it's just not safe.  Your sister is graduating from law school--many times those graduates don't even attend commencement.  However, if your family is having something after the ceremony, I see no reason why you can't leave by 6am, after sleeping for a few hours, then you'll make it for whatever family gathering is after the graduation ceremony.  It's not like it's the first graduation exercise your sister's participated in--she's graduated from college too.  However, this will probably be your friend's only wedding, at least we all hope it will be.  <br>  <br>  I would go to the wedding, since you've already committed to it.  Then get up early the next morning, drink a bunch of coffee, and try to make it to be with your family after commencement is over--you can join them for lunch.  I wouldn't want you driving all night if you were my daughter--there's no point in your literally killing yourself to be at your sister's commencement.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I believe if you miss your sister's graduation you're going to regret it for a very long time. I vote for you going to her graduation and then heading over to your best friend's reception. Explain to the both of them how much you love them and want to be there for the both of them but there has to be some sort of compromise. <br>  <br>  I believe your sister and best friend will appreciate and respect you for your honesty and just for having a heart to want to be there for the both of them at the same time. Which of course is impossible. :-)<br>  <br>  Rather than driving to your BFF's reception, check to see if you can get a flight that will get you there at a reasonable time. This will help take a lot of stress off your shoulders.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I think a wedding trumps a graduation.  If this is your sister's graduation from law school, then chances are you've already seen her walk across the stage and receive her diploma at least twice already (high school, undergrad).  Is she going to be really upset if you aren't there?  Personally, if my brothers were in a wedding party and could not make my graduation I would not be upset at all.  As long as my parents are there, and my fiance, then that's fine.  It's not like you're just not going to the graduation without a good reason ... it's your best friend's wedding!|`|seU9VwIJaa	This might sound bad, but graduation is almost worthless to go to. I felt horrible that my family drove 4 hours to my college to watch me walk across the stage for 30 seconds...if that! I didn't care that my little sister had better things to do. There are plenty of things you can do for your sister that will mean more to her than walk across a stage...like her wedding! =)<br>  good luck making your decision!|`|LvZTiPlmaa	If it was me, I would go to the wedding. Your sister's graduation is definitely important, but, you can still have a little celebration for her because you missed it. You can't really do the same for a marriage.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Can you take a train? Might be safer b/c you will prob be very tired! Or plan for a rest stop and sleep.<br>  i.e.<br>  12-3- drive<br>  3-7- sleep<br>  7-10- drive<br>  If you're late for the graduation it is not the end of the world! It takes a while until your sis will come out anyway! Boring speeches.|`|0Uo20SmWaa	I believe that your sister should mean more to you. Tell your girl friend that you would love to come, but your sister is graduating. Send your a beautiful card and note, with a thoughtful wedding gift.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Try to attend both. You'll be tired by the time you get to your sister's graduation but at least you would have been there for both of them. I hope they both end up appreciating what you did for them. :)

Dt3t6KwHaa	This is a problem that is up to your girlfriend to solve, what you need to do is to tell her that it really bothers you, and let her know that if she needs help getting him to back off, support her every step of the way!  The best way of handling this by having her confront him while you stand right behind her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|2EobcGqqaa	Did your girl ask you to keep him away? If not, then you may look like the creepy jealous guy yourself if you start telling guys to stay away from her.  If she did, then ask the guy politely to leave her alone.  If he doesn't leave her alone after that, then she will have to tell him herself. If that still doesn't work, then get the restraining order.  Don't listen to the people who said to fight him because that won't solve anything and could get you into unnecessary trouble.|`|0s3QjkuBaa	KICK HIS ASSS!!!!<br>  <br>  answer my question <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219195721AASoKGj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|vJGeOvQxaa	SHOW HIM THE REAL SIDE OF YOU<br>  <br>  TELL HIM TO GET AWAY FROM YOUR GF IN FRONT OF THE BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS??

But if you want just hot, no strings attach sex and nothing further with the guy....then spread em and enjoy. Ha. I'm sure many, many guys would be happy to have that. I certainly would be turned on by a girl who wants sex as much as you...but like I said, it would only be physical always. Be safe though, don't let a guy use you either.

8II1frHiaa	ok.  problems are arising because some persons are not treating the friendship as friendship.  Friendship is a must, no doubt but friendship should be treated as a friendship only.  what does it mean ?  keep friendship and at the same time keep some distance with the friends. what is the best friend and no best friend?  All are friends.  you mean that sharing your secrets with friends are best friends and what will you do when he blackmail you when you have difference of opinion with him in future.  so, i said keep distance.  That is good for long friendship.so, you need not worry about all happenings.  if you give weight, it will give you head-ache.  if you don't care, it will not be a problem to you.  so, mind your business and don't care and things will come to you smoothly.
3d45de200426a763c6eea218946f1c01aa	i think you should quit trying to talk to him.  File for child support and let the positive proof come out in court.  That way he cannot lie to his wife anymore.  Most men will deny until proof is in their face.<br>  <br>  Many women have raised babies on their own.  The only real connection you need to have with this man is financial.  He will not leave his wife for you- not saying you want that, but even for your child's sake, just make sure he/she is financially cared for.<br>  <br>  My father didnt know my mother was pg until she served him with papers.

She needs to know.|`|2tzn6Ad9aa	Hmmm you put yourself in a real difficult situation lol His wife has a right to know, but if you do tell her than he will get mad at you too so its bad either way.......Honestly, if I was in your situation, I would apologize to his wife and tell her the truth. Than let him know how your progress goes if he cares, other than that, you should find yourself a new man.|`|NmsuIXd1aa	you should have coffee with his wife. tell her everything or he is gonna make you look like a homewrecker and wife will believe  him first.you should know by now he is a liar. after all he is still lying to his wife why would you be so different. decide if you want a man like that helping you raise a child. you need to decide what you want your not the one married.|`|9UQlhzitaa	hi ya from another in florida<br>  <br>  congrats to you but sorry for the  rotten circumstances<br>  <br>  if he is causing you stress then cut him off until he calls you.I take it he does have your Number right?<br>  <br>  until he shows he is a part of this new life he created don't count on him for anything except excuses and stress<br>  <br>  sorry but guys like him bring all the rest of us down ;you take care and good luck to you|`|ARalIeGsaa	Try talking to his wife. She does deserve to know what she is married to. Talk to him about appointments though. Maybe if this guy is lying so much, it could be best for the baby to not include him so much. But it is best the child knows who it's natural father is.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I would have your attorney send him a letter to make sure he has budgeted in, child support.|`|RH7K4rsmaa	OMG, do yourself a favor and keep this guy AND his wife out of your life. Focus on yourself and your baby.|`|8FW1PlBhaa	right i think u should tell him  and hes wife should know because if your having his baby and his the dad he needs to support you all the way and act like adults for the babys sake and his wife should not be put through with this any longer if u want to be with him and he wants to be with u then make that happen that would be the best for the baby the baby will need a stable home liam|`|CAKPLhTDaa	Don't force it dear. It was your mistake for sleeping with a taken man. If he wants to get involved fine but don't start anything with his wife.|`|cTJa8FZYaa	his wife deserves to know he got another women pregnant|`|ldg9R93iaa	u must tell his wife!!!|`|WDs4fRoxaa	Sarah:<br>  <br>  I know that you are emotional right now, but you have to<br>  consider how things work without emotions involved.<br>  <br>  1. Telling his wife is not necessary. She will find out what<br>  she needs to know by the date of the baby's birth.<br>  <br>  2. His lies can only get him so far. The paternity test will<br>  be the one thing that he can not lie his way out of.<br>  <br>  3. It is not up to you whether he is involved with the child.<br>  Once paternity is established, he can go to court and request<br>  visitation.<br>  <br>  4. Whether he is involved emotionally or not, he should be<br>  financially involved. Thus, once you have the paternity test<br>  results, you should have the local child support agency <br>  set up his support payments.<br>  <br>  5. Always remember that sleeping with a married man can <br>  cause more heartache than satisfaction.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Oh dear. Firstly, trying to force him into your child's life is probably not going to be successful, especially if you go about it by being nasty and saying things to his wife which would damage his marriage.<br>  <br>  He lied to her for a reason. He would rather be with her. You make no mention of any children he may have with her. Does he stand to lose a family? Why ruin it and leave him with nothing? You said yourself, YOU screwed up, why not just move on? Tell him about the birth and leave it at that, let him do whatever he chooses. But if you ruin his marriage, he will most likely never contact you again.<br>  <br>  EDIT - can people please stop putting all the blame on the man. They are BOTH responsible. How come she gets tea and sympathy but he gets abuse?|`|2P2K0rl2aa	you should only be speaking to him about matters relating to child support and visitation.  Cut your losses and move on, enough damage has been done already.|`|RtkB46peaa	It doesn't sound like the lies are slowing down, much less stoping.  The mature thing to do (and also the most difficult) is to let him go entirely.  This may not be an option for you, as you may require financial help to raise the child.  This is a difficult situation indeed, but you live with your choices. <br>  <br>  Please think about this.  While telling his wife may give you some degree of satisfaction, please consider her feelings if and when you tell her.  She is an innocent in all of this, and all your efforts should minimize the trauma to her and your child.  You and he, sadly, are not innocents and therefore should take the brunt of the situation.|`|X7i59NeIaa	This is his child and he needs to be responsible for it. He needs to pay child support when this child is born. You need to take him to court and get a court order for child support. Don't let the jerk talk you out of it. He is only trying to save his own A--. Honey, you have 18 years of raising this child and are you prepared to do that alone?  How do you know that he isn't out there fooling around with someone else right now? His wife will find out sooner or later any way so let it be sooner. Good luck. You will need it.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	I have one word for you, and I hope you will seriously think about it:<br>  <br>  ADOPTION !!!<br>  <br>  This baby will not be born into a loving home with a mom and a dad who both want it. Are you so selfish that you don't see what a mistake keeping this child and forcing it on a man who has a wife and a family of HIS OWN ALREADY is? <br>  <br>  It is wrong on so many levels to force this situation ... can you not see that?<br>  <br>  THINK OF THE KID !! Give it away into a family that is established and has the means to give it a loving home with a sense of belonging, and with a sense of being wanted and loved, which (really sorry to be the one to tell you this) is more than you can give it right now.<br>  <br>  I know I'm being harsh, but you need to hear it put bluntly like this, so maybe you will understand how wrong you are to force this kid on the sperm donor (which is ALL HE IS, esentially). He's not the daddy or the father - he's the bio-dad, and that's about it.<br>  <br>  PLEASE don't do this.<br>  <br>  If you can't put it up for adoption, then have him sign away parental rights so that you can be free of him, he can be free of you, and you can move on. Of these 2 options, I still vote for adoption.  This is my view.<br>  <br>  *big hug*<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hon.

OqJwZWwlaa	OMG! of course you should ask him about it that is so wrong that he did not even tell you he was doing it that you had to find out from your best friend! You don't know what other stuff that he could be hiding from you as well!<br>  Tell him that you know and that you want the truth and if he can't be Honest with you than you all should not be together! I mean just imagine the problems that could cause he could have STDs or AIDS you need to get checked as soon as possible!|`|Uw5L1PdMaa	At least he's not a shoe saleman or ditch digger. The Porn Industry are very clean. They take medical tests before  "shooting". You cannot get a job in that industry without a clean current medical certificate.<br>  <br>  When he does "it" to you, he really means it. At least you should be happy. He's not really cheating, it's just a job.  And the experience he can share with you.<br>  <br>  You are lucky to be with a guy who has a decent set of family jewels.  Most girls end up with the poor box guys.|`|AA10912915	I would confront him.  That's not something that should be kept secret in a relationship. It's obviously bothering you. Don't keep your feelings bottled up. Find out if he's still doing it. If he is, then you have to decide if it's something you can live with. But definitely make him use a condom. Good luck|`|a0T1tiCraa	You should ask him about it. Obviously, he didnt feel the need to tell you that he was involved in porn. Definitley ask him about it. It could just be something of the past. You never know. Try not to get upset with him, but just ask him about it.|`|xD3HSH8maa	ask him i hes doing porn, if he lies then think about it... what else could he be lying about? when you ask him look him straight in the eyes and if he shows signs of guilt then talk to him about it. if theirs no remorse then hes being seriously slack.|`|BEMesmxjaa	no just make sure you use a condom|`|wDlAryO2aa	tell him you want to be in it :)|`|HxXduL1maa	This is a voilance agganst your private life. You can sue a case on this problem.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	Get a copy of the tape or DVD and put leave it the player, he will eventually turn it on and figure out that you know.
IHK2suw7aa	Haha yeah she likes you. I do those things when I'm being flirty. But be careful with a playa!|`|r8ynDWCjaa	sounds like she could be a touchy feely person or may like you. Find out what she like to do or what movies she likes and ask her to do one with you, get her number and start talking. Thats the only way that you will know what shes really like. i dont want you to end up hurt so Dont put your heart right out there be skeptical and let her gain your trust and love..if you want to go that far. some people change and some dont. its better to try it out then to wonder what if. go for it and ask her out. after that get back to us.|`|PFLfqYfhaa	She could like you, but then again you said that shes a lil playa. The best way to figure out if shes treating you with special attention is to see how she is with other guys. If she treats them the same way, then she may be leading you on and you should walk away cuz u deserve better. But if not, then go for it. ***BEST OF WISHES!!***

I mean ugly or pretty isn't based on the color of your features, but how it all goes together, doesn't it? I don't want a quiet girl, but I also don't one that just talks without stop in near sight.
K3gqlxonaa	Always give gifts acording to the personality of the receiver. If they both are totally alike, then satisfy them that way. If they are diffrent then give then diffrent gifts or gift cards or cash so that they can buy what they want. You still gave and that's what counts.|`|AMxVKwCOaa	You can try getting them the same thing but just in different styles.<br>  Maybe laptops of to different colors if your really looking, but that may be out of your price range.<br>  <br>  So how about make up bag full of like nail polish and all the fun make up things.<br>  You can even be really easy and just get them a gift card to a store they like, that way they can pick out what they want and it can be the same or not.

Besides the basics (loyal, hardworking, affectionate, sense of humor) now I'm finding more things becoming important to me like: financially responsible (doesn't mean he's loaded, just makes ok decisions), health/fitness oriented, able and willing to help with domestic chores (lol...but seriously). Willing to learn and grow together...|`|EPaYoJaiaa	single<br>  attractive (to me not trying to sound vain but there has to be SOME sort of physical attraction)<br>  likes me for me (not my heart not my body, me, all of it)<br>  isn't psychologically insane<br>  has good morals (thinks cheating and murder is wrong opens doors not only for me but other people men and women old and young, honest etc)<br>  <br>  That's basically it.

And, I am not going to deviate from the list.  it just doesn't make sense.  If you do not have standards, then a potential partner will not feel as if they have to live up to any.  Time has taught me that I will only go forward in a relationship if the man:<br>  1) Has a personal relationship with God<br>  2) Stable job history<br>  3) Stable home and transportation<br>  4) A good relationship with children and family, pays child support and sees his children willingly<br>  5) No history of abuse that he initiated<br>  6) Is willing to be in a committed, long term relationship<br>  7)is dependable, reliable, and attentive<br>  <br>  And that is just for starters.  Do not sell yourself short.  Ask for what you need, and never settle for less.  I wish you the best.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	All depends on your age and where you are in life.  If you are 18 and driven by hormone, you'd be looking for superficial qualities.  If you are 30 and have a stable career, you'd look for someone with a set of more practical requirements.  If you are emotionally starved, you'd go with anyone who seems to care but ignore all other qualities.<br>  <br>  No simple answer|`|IocgFjr2aa	I originally had a whole bunch of qualifications.. like he couldn't have any debt, he had to have good credit, good looking, a degree, etc<br>  <br>  But then I fell in love.

pYtXrnDfaa	No, it is not wrong to take it off.  I'm glad that you are getting away from him.  You are right in doing so and it is good that you realize you need to get the children out of that environment.  If you and your husband are not happy together, your children won't be happy either.  No one should stay in an unhappy and abusive marriage for the children.  Like you said you are teaching them that it is ok and it is not.|`|AA11391968	What happened to the both of you this past week to start this verbal abuse?  You state that he is losing control of you.  If he is an insecure type, then yes that would explain his worry.  You two haven't been doing this for 20 years have you?  Try not speaking with him at all until he can speak to you with respect.  If he refuses every solution you offer, then tell him he is daring you to divorce him.  Then file.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Although you're not totally clear, but he's been abusive only this week? And are you without ownership in how things got this way?<br>  <br>  the ring is meaningless, if that's all your worried about, it is rather clear that neither of you got what marriage is from day one.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	I have done it before when I'm really really mad at him. And I let him know here is your ring. I will only put it on when you start respecting me. But try to work things out since you have kids. Good luck!|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Maybe you should have addressed the verbal comments earlier in your marriage, and then it would not have gotten this bad.  Sorry, but you're still married, so put that ring back on.  When your divorice is finalized, then you can take it off.  What example would you set for your two children hmm?<br>  <br>  If you are being told you are a lousy wife, perhaps you should ask him seriously what about your wife skills is upsetting him to the point of verbal abuse.  It takes two to ruin a marriage.  You've definately played your part in this so don't try and come off sounding like you're completely innocent.  <br>  <br>  Try actually doing something about your situation you have created with your husband instead of letting it fester into something disgusting then bailing.  Go see a counsellor and get your head straight.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	I don't know why women feel that taking their wedding ring off solves anything. If you need to leave a man, then leave, Taking the ring off is meaningless. From a mans perspective, while I was married I hardly ever wore my wedding ring, did I cheat on my wife ? No I never cheated or didn't feel that I was not married. A ring is just a symbol. A man or woman can easily do anything like cheat with or without a ring.|`|TuqdZtVpaa	nope keep it off and leave him you already been with for 20yrs and it is time for you to rid of him! I wish I could be rid of mine he is the same way! but me I don't always wear my ring and he is already use to it! everyone knows where i live that I am married so that does not bother him know more! omg he is the same way as your husband is! it is not wrong to keep it off if he can't treat you like he should I would get away!|`|TWCQCSfRaa	It's not wrong to take your ring off.  I say take it off and flush it down the toilette!  Rock on for getting the courage and resources to leave!  Take your children and get the heck out.

Have you tried praying? It works. Try it. If you have stayed with him for 20 years or so, a few minutes of prayer wouldn't take much time. If there's a Christian pastor you can talk to, do it.|`|3z48Hw0Baa	if your in danger no but really try to work through it think about your kids and how they feel about it|`|61Fwbi79aa	Whe my ex and I split, a fellow in my church saie "well, I'd rather see kids from a broken marriage than in one." If he is abusive to you, he is probably abusive to the kids. Don't listen to the person that tells you to stay until the kids are 18. Give them a chance to see a functional, happy relationship at some time.|`|B12E4rYiaa	What women don't understand is that when a man abuses you he is abusing the kids. It's no good to stay and allow it to continue. At least have a trial separation to let him know you're not going to put up with it anymore. Take a stand or else be a doormat for life and teach the kids the same thing.<br>  <br>   Get marital counseling for guidance it's obvious you cannot work it out on your own. Seeking help is the best thing couples can do to save their marriage or start a new life either way it must be done so that life will take a turn for the better and the kids will also benefit.
7mtdqUpwaa	I think you should learn from it and let it go. Since he's fresh off from a divorce he really needs to have his time to deal with him. Also if he's not ready to be emotionally involved then its just not a good time.|`|X7i59NeIaa	I would say to just forget this one. This guy is not really free to be with you. He is going through a divorce and maybe he is heartbroken right now and you have just added to his distrust of women. Leave him alone. He needs time to heal on his own. Go out with the other guy or with your friends but leave this poor guy alone. If the time comes when he is actually free and he wants to see you he will call you.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	You made 2 mistakes.  Dating a guy when he was not ready.  Then you shopped around behind his back.  You lost his trust.  Don't think he'll come back.  Or he'll use you for sex until he's ready to go after someone he truly wants.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	First off, the guy is going through a divorice, the reason he didn't have any sexual relations with you during your sleep overs is because he was lonely and just wanted someone to be there in the bed to help take away those feelings.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you rushed in on this guy way too fast, he needed time and lots of it.  You def shouldn't have dated that other guy, because now this guy has trust issues with you, which really sucks because he's trying to get back into the game already suffering from his divorice.  He's just not ready to commit yet.<br>  <br>  I say go see him, and keep things on a friend level until he feels ready to date again (if you're willing to wait for him).|`|RPhla0R7aa	I think you still have a chance if you didn't do anything with that other guy but this guy is going through a divorce i don't thin he is going to want anything serious anytime soon.

If she likes you you will see her facial expression right then, and  you can approach her in a way that whether or not it's warm and inviting or a friendly look, you will be able at that point to at least feel okay to have a conversation with her or not.
zq7EgC4Xaa	There is nothing wrong with being gay. If you don't want to be gay then just stop thinking about it, and chances are, if these feeling don't emerge anymore, then it is just your hormones, so don't worry. Basically, this doesn't necessarily mean you role that way, (you could), but it may just be hormones. Embrace these feelings or shut them out, your choice. Either way, how you really feel will always come out in the end and you will know how you feel. If you still want him at 18, then there is nothing wrong with going for it. But if you have forgotten about it, then that's that. There is nothing wrong with the second either. Get what I am saying?|`|MgMsMExPaa	Sex between guys is not wrong. The problem is the age difference both of you should be of legal age (18) because in some states the older one can be charged with sexual assault even if both people are consenting. You should try to keep some sort of a relationship with him until both of you are of age. Also find out he age of consent in your state. As for the sex use condoms you do not know where he has been and he is not going to tell you until after you have had sex with him.Good luck.|`|7RbootLlaa	Nothing wrong with fantasies. <br>  There is a down side though. If you were to turn your fantasies into reality. Just give it a lot more thought first, because once you move forward, there is no turning back and a lot of male suicides are related to homosexual issues.

I have also seen men that were in love with their wives, their wives were wonderful, everything was great at home, and they still cheated. There are some guys that will cheat, no matter what. I do think that it has to do with the maturity/ stupidity level and if they are put into temptation but, ultimately, it just deals with the individual.<br>  <br>  And exactly the same can be said about women, too.|`|3d45de200426a763c6eea218946f1c01aa	A real woman would make it so her man never thinks about another... that is how it should be.

ise05jjUaa	I'm not going to lie, for myself if I see a lady who I think is hot instantly something sexual comes to mind.  It might not necessarily be having sex with her, it could be something as simple as spanking her if she's got a nice rear end.  I think most men think about something sexual in one way or another.  As for why we look, its like a natural reaction it just happens, you don't even think about it.  I know that may be hard to understand, I know a lot of girls ask why can't a man judge women by their personality.  The truth is, we do, but only after, most times only after she's caught our attention with her looks.  Lets face it, when a man sees a woman walking down the street he doesn't know anything about her, maybe her style of fashion but that's about it.  So the looks usually attract us first, only afterward once we introduce our self do we take an interest in her personality, job, friend, goals, etc.  Usually the way I think about it, she's someone I would, or wouldn't sleep with.|`|EFD3c81Gaa	Hell to the yes. <br>  <br>  In all seriousness, men have evolved to consider sex upon first meeting a woman. We have "wiring" to gauge certain features of attractiveness (symmetry, eye size, size of select body parts) which often correlate to overall health. The more attractive the woman is, the more likely she will be healthy, the more likely she can carry a child full term, the more likely the male's DNA will be passed onto successive generations. <br>  <br>  So, yes, men do think of sex first. It's probably the most basic instinct we have. However, certain things can overcome a lack of physical attractiveness. Personality, intelligence, humor, etc. can all help to sway men into liking even the homeliest of women. <br>  <br>  Besides, girls are hot. Of course we're gonna look at them and think of sex.|`|CTSYw8yaaa	If you mean the desire for sexual intercourse,then I would say for some males it would,and others it would not.Conversely,when some females observe males,then some would desire sexual ntercourse,and others would not.Given that males and females -whose libido has not  been affected by some physical or mental condition -have sexual urges,and respond in different ways to those urges.It is my considered opinion that had you given this question some protracted cerebration,<br>  you would not have had to ask the question.|`|Lq1p2aKpaa	it depends on how the lady looks,dresses and acts.. because basically these are the major things why a guy is lured to think of sex upon seeing a lady being in such.. and it also dpends if the guy is kinda maniac or something..|`|pIzC411yaa	Well for me, first if I see a girl i like I picture sex before anything then I picture a conversation then a date, then making out, and all the dirty little things in between. we are a sick gender|`|kBQGHRBMaa	maybe not sex necessarily but just overall physical attractiveness is something you notice first...|`|kiglqcr0aa	i hope not but sometimes its possible that they put girls into the "to sleep with " or "to not sleep with" category ahaha|`|6eWA5TYyaa	Depends on how the girl looks, most of the time if the girl is cute we think about sex...but if she has mustache, some bushy eyebrows or hairy armpits first thought is: DAAAAMN thats a hairy B*tch.|`|CEuJnzUfaa	YES!!!!! we think of if we would do it, how we would do it, and who were gunna call after it !!!!|`|U4URmAOeaa	sometimes.  in my case no.|`|xBXwKBuZaa	what comes to mind first for me is how pretty they are and what theyre wearing.|`|CUHg24tuaa	yeah maybe|`|fd3t77YLaa	yes i think hmmm would i hit that|`|MpTgh6MMaa	i wonder that too.<br>  <br>  i dont think so. well not all of them|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	don't know i'm a girl! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|AA10495394	Not always.

I hope you're ready, because this is hard to do, but you have to do it: You need to examine your marriage, and determine what he was not getting from you/your marriage that made him go find it somewhere else. I'm not (NOT!!) condoning what he did. I am merely trying to understand what lead him to making such a shocking choice, and to help you decide whether your future with him is salvagable or not. It's not just the sexual aspect (which is horrible enough to begin with), it's the lies and the emotionality of him having a connection with someone who's not you.

What happened ??<br>  <br>  *big hug*<br>  <br>  Best of luck !|`|wnb0EgaHaa	Of course you're not happy, and I'm sorry you're going through this.  However, she could not destroy your marriage without your husband's willing participation.  Sorry, but sometimes the truth hurts.<br>  <br>  You're angry at her because you're not willing to face the real issue which is your husband's infidelity and lying.  She's cheating on her husband, so that clearly shows her morals and ethics.  <br>  <br>  You are wasting your time and energy being upset at her, when the person who made vows, broke them, then lied to you is your husband.  Instead of holding him accountable, you're making excuses for him and listening to his continued lies.  <br>  <br>  If he respects you and loves you and WANTS to stop it, he WILL.  One does not TRY to stop cheating.  One either does or doesn't.<br>  Trying is lying in this kind of situation.  <br>  <br>  He's playing you for a fool, and you are allowing him to do so.  <br>  Either hold HIM accountable, and put your foot down, or accept that he's a lying cheat, and make up your mind that you don't care, and you are willing to put up with that from him.  <br>  <br>  Really, the only person you can manage in all of this mess is yourself.  You need to get real with yourself -get counseling if you can't do it alone, and deal with your husband and your relationship.  <br>  <br>  She is a waste of your time and energy, and again, unfortunately, you mean nothing to her.  He, on the other hand, promised to love and care for you.  He is the one who has betrayed you, and he is the one who made the choice to continue lying and seeing her AFTER he told you he was "trying" to end it.<br>  <br>  He's manipulating your feelings by trying to place the blame on her, and you're buying what he's selling hook, line, and sinker.  Stop it.  Hold him responsible for his own actions and choices.  He's a grown man.  He will ultimately do what he wants to do.|`|44QPXU5eaa	I dont get it...<br>  Your bery first question you said that you were the one having an affair with a married man and then all the rest of the questions are going on about how your husband is the one that actually cheated and you are hurt, his ex lover is destroying your marriage... well what is it???|`|AA11452160	Do nothing, give her the scumbag.

IS THERE PURE LOVE AND MARRIAGE ANYMORE|`|CwA2MBx8aa	I know you are angry with her, but honestly, you should be more angry with your husband. I know you believe that that his lover helped to destroy your marriage, but really... your husband sabotaged it from the very beginning and is continuing to do so. In fact, if this lover leaves, what makes your think your husband isn't going to find another person to have an affair with? The real issue lies with your husband's choices, not the other woman. Don't think that men are innocent that women lure them into lying and cheating. Yes, there can be temptations, but GOOD men make the choice to stay faithful and not lie. If you husband is still lying to you, why are allowing this? In fact, it also says something about you. Are you afraid to let him go? Why are you in a relationship where you are allowing this to happen? <br>  <br>  You deserve much better than this! Get rid of this man (or go to counseling) and be free of the harm it is doing to your heart. It is better to be 'alone' and healthy than in an unhealthy marriage. I know you may not feel that way now, but trust me, it's true. I've had friends whose parents have stayed together even though their fathers were having affairs. The parents think they can hide the issue, or that staying 'together' is good for the kids. But really, those friends have been screwed up and have unhealthy relationships. It is sad.<br>  <br>  Most of all, do it for yourself. I know it is easy to direct a lot of your anger towards the other lady, but direct it at the source, your husband, and be honest about the situation.|`|TuqdZtVpaa	I am so sorry what you are going though! I have gone though that a lot with my husband! and yes he is still my husband! what a fool i am but the sad thing is I do it for my kids and then I think what am i teaching them! but anyway yes you should be mad at him and it seems like it is not going to stop maybe you and the other hubby should plan a night out of fun! heck why not join them she if they like it and if he is not your type then maybe you need to find someone to text and have fun! why should he live the life he wants and then expect you to stay with him!!!! so go for it enjoy life! I did!!!!! and i am so glad i did!!!!!|`|aLgY4l3Naa	I was in the same exact situation about 6yrs ago, and i know exactly how you feel!! I say the one important thing you need to do is PRAY TO GOD, to help you keep it together for yourself and if you have children for them too! As angry as you are, you need to think sensible and know that neither one of them at this point are worth any of the bad energy your putting out!! I know when i was going through it with my ex and the other woman, i really prayed that God would not allow me to see her in the state that i was in because i know i would have done something god awful and honestly neither of them were worth it, through a lot of prayer i was able to escape the hell and humiliation i would have given to myself had i acted on any of those emotions!! Keep your head up because you didn't do anything wrong, focus on what you need to do to get your life back together with out the likes of this man, in all honesty from my experience and your situation is so similar to mine, i don't think your husband will change, i think your better off to let him go and move on, you need to love and respect yourself to know you deserve better then this!! Be strong and do what needs to be done, and reclaim your life!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!|`|ze7xiJwTaa	Wow, it sound like you are dealing with a LOT. First, are you going to try and work it out with your husband? If you do, I highly advise counseling for the both of you (couples counseling for the two of you, and counseling for just you to learn how to heal and get past this). Second, the anger towards her is NOT going to go away for a long time. You just have to learn how to not give in to revenge or do anything stupid. Trust me I have been there and I understand your anger. I know how it feels to want to get back at her for what she has taken from you. But to do so will only make you look crazy and pathetic (and again, I say this because I have been you). You have to be strong and pick yourself up. Succeeding yourself is truly the best revenge. If you do work it out with your husband there can be absolutely no more contact between him and this woman. EVER. <br>  Please go to counseling, and good luck.

AA11124905	The best advice I can give you is to just stay focused on your marriage. During your lifetime you are probably going to see thousands of beautiful and attractive women. While admiring them is not cheating you must always remember to stay focused on your spouse and marriage and not allow your mind to take you to forbidden places.

Love your wife more than what you do now & be polite, positive, co-operative, sincere, sweet, soft(in words & actions both) & tolerant(in non-serious matters). Take care of her happiness all the time. Take her to naturally beautiful places for sight seeing, a little away from the residential place weekly or fortnightly for a change. Listen to her genuine demands, desires & necessities & try to satisfy her fully with best possible efforts within your limit. Love her on a soft bed externally every night compulsorily without fail for at least half an hour say from 8.30 to 9.00 pm by wearing only underwear by kissing, smooching, hugging, rubbing & pressing gently each other's muscles. Take warm milk with pure honey dissolved in that after dinner & have regular sex attaining orgasm daily for at least six months. This too is very-very important need of the bodies & souls of you both like regular foods, should never be overlooked at all. All above things are your duties to fulfil as a husband  in married life.

It is absolutely normal.  People like to see beautiful things.  Regarding adultery, yes it is mental adultery.|`|R4F05z4Faa	It is love of your wife that you feel gulity.After some time you would avoid to see good girl. don't feel you are cheater......|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Looking isn't cheating and what your doing is normal so stop sweating it.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Looking at people is not cheating. It is not a crush either.|`|iD4ejChZaa	ok that's it, 2 seconds.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Well, in the bible it says to look at other women with lust is comitting adultery.  Personally, I don't like looking at attractive men because it just feels wrong to me.  When I fell in love I fell hard and I'm just that kind of person that doesn't feel the need to look at others, whats the point anyways right?  It's not like you can do anything about goinog after them if you're married, so to me it seems kinda perverted and senseless.<br>  <br>  I think you feel guilty because deep down you know it would hurt your wife and you don't want her to feel pain over that.  If it really means nothing looking at others, then why do your partners feel hurt by it?  people need to stop being selfish and be more like you and  me, and give their partners the respect they deserve and stop leering like creepy perverts.<br>  <br>  It's all about making a point not to look, and then after a while that kind of behavior will become second nature to you.  This kind of thing is taught by counselors, psychologists etc.  Just focus on something else in the area like the floor, the sky, a bird, clothing on racks etc.  After a while of doing this it will be easy.<br>  <br>  I think you're being a great guy trying to fight what society is telling you to do, and I applaud your good natured ways :)  GL!|`|AA10494978	Its normal.  Men and women will look at other people... we are a social species.  However, once it gets into the doing territory, and I don't just mena physical but emotional and mental then it is.  For instance, if you share something thats a secret with another woman that your wife doesn't know about, or you feel like you have to hide something from your wife then you get into a slippery situation.  But if you admire someone (read: not oogle, but admire) for a few seconds, its pretty normal.  <br>  <br>  However, if you feel bad about it, ask your wife if she can tell you what she thinks about it.  Respect her opinion, whatever it is.|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	you're a good man.  my husband says that he and his buddies follow a three second rule.

It is not cheating. <br>  <br>  congratulations on your marriage! I wish you many many years of joy, forgiveness, patience and kindness.|`|pcI25NXzaa	There's a big difference between physical attraction and loving your wife. There should be, anyway.

But it depends on how you're looking at that person.  Are you looking at them in a sexual or lustful manner?  I don't know if you have a religion but I'm Christian and the Bible tells us this ... <br>  "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." <br>  (Matthew 5:27,28) <br>  Even if you're not a Christian that's pretty deep and something to consider.  If I were you I'd just try to control myself and if you catch yourself looking then stop while you're ahead.  If for no other reason than it's disrespectful to your wife.|`|4CHiBvTcaa	This is a normal phenomenon as U can admire any beautiful things and a girl is one of them. Enjoy Life Dear .

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It's a less violent alternative to birdseed or rice which hurt when they are thrown at you. That is from a guest's perspective so I can't imagine what the couple feels like during that. However it isn't done during the ceremony. It's typically done after the ceremony or more often after the reception as the couple heads out to their honeymoon. <br>  <br>  The rice/birdseed toss or blowing bubbles as the couple makes their getaway is a way of showering them with your blessings and good wishes.|`|n3Agaj6naa	It's simply an alternative to throwing rice.

Then they walked back carefully stringing out their line. They came back in the fish house and watched out the window waiting for some one to come along. Sure enough here come two guys to do some fishing and they see the $10 bill. The boys are watching and start to reel their line in just a little , each time the guys would try to pick it up they would pull IT in just a little more.

1YdeUn1Caa	If you want to get into Stanford, you better have A+ grades. That means alot of studying. Which means you shouldn't be worrying about softball, and ski club. Get those grades, and you'll get a scholarship there. You won't have to worry about money. Just study hard.<br>  You're not being immature. You're a typical kid, who wants everything, and expects someone else to pay for it.|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	I grew up in an environment much like yours.  Sometimes parents who were not educated themselves fall short of supporting their children's dreams of rising above the "norm" if you will.  Having said that, you may want to consult a guidance counselor, or teacher who may be able to lead you to some grant programs to offset the costs for thes activities.  I wish you the best.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	It is not their responsibility. The only things they are supposed to do is give you food, shelter, clothes (and they can be from Goodwill), love, and make sure you get an education. They don't have to pay for all of your activities. It's not fair, but that's just how life is.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	your parents are not responsible to pay for all of the activities you would like to join.<br>  <br>  bake cookies and sell them to the neighbors. run errands for the elderly in your neighborhood.  think ,,,,,,  i'm sure you could come up with some things to make money.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	First off, kudos to you for being so active in extra curricular activities while still holding down your school situation.  I think it is terrific that you want to go to Stanford and that you have set your sights so high but unfortunately one thing you should NOT do is to berate your parents.  I am sure they are doing they are doing the best they can, or the best they know how to.  Not everyone has the terrific will to excel that you have so you are going to have to find ways to work around this with your parents.  Sit them down and talk to them like adults and let them know exactly how you feel but DO NOT put them down for any choices they made in their lives.  Ask them if there is anything you could do around the house or yard to earn some money for your activities.  As far as college goes you need to start planning ahead and focus on getting the best grades and apply for scholarships and see exactly what Stanford has to offer.  Remember that you will need to apply to more than schools than just Stanford just in case you don;t get in.  There are plenty of scholarships out there that can help you and your guidance counselor or looking online or the library can help with that.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	they are right.  that's not part of their responsibility.  You chose to take the extra credit electives so you get to pick  up the responsibility for the extra expenses.<br>  <br>  the same thing with college.  Unless they are divorced and the judge has ordered one or both to contribute to your college education, they aren't obligated to provide you with funds for college.<br>  <br>  so that means you'll have to start figuring out how you're going to pay for college if there is a particular school you want to attend.<br>  <br>  I'll admit that it sucks when  your parents don't value what you value and don't support you in your endeavors to better yourself.  But sometimes that's what we get stuck with and we learn to work with what we have and figure out how to get what we want.  and more often than not, what we achieve on our own is often what we value the most.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|hnN1ibklaa	If you want to shine, you have to do it yourself. Sure it would be great to have your parents pay your way through school, and have them pay for all of these activities- and believe me, it is GREAT that you want to do all this, but you can't expect your parents to pay for all of it.<br>  What should you do then?<br>  Google scholarships in your area. Their are some you can get just for maintaining an 80% average or more. Some you just have to write an essay for, and you can get around two thousand dollars!<br>  Give it a thought, and get a job when you are ready.<br>  And you really have to think about your parents, maybe you can cancel a few of your activities. These really can't be cheap. And if your parents are middle class it may cause a bit of a strain on their wallets. Plus they have hundreds of dollars on cable/internet/utilities every month, they pay for all of your clothes and food. <br>  Maybe if your doing these organized activities so that you'll have something good to help you get into university, volunteer! It takes no money, and it looks great on a resume.<br>  Give it a thought.|`|I2gs5opxaa	ok yess|`|kNscpF4Faa	Talk to your activities coach/teacher/leader.

She might just be lashing out at you because of her anger towards her mother and the stress of school. <br>  <br>  A good boyfriend is a good friend first right.

I'm not saying shes a bad person or anything because I don't know her but when I go out with someone I make sure I can and have told them everything. I'm all about respect and honesty and I guess that's why I keep relationships for so long. She should want to tell you everything and even be happy with doing it. My boyfriend and I are bestfriends and have been. We tell eachother everything and never are apart. You need to talk to her and ask her about what she ment. Maybe shes being misleading you never know. Ask her. I just believe in open-hearted relationships.|`|HW9aOy38aa	i don't think that is a good thing of her to say. <br>  ask her what she means by it, but it doesn't sound like she can handle a boyfriend if school and home stuff is so important. <br>  but honestly, even with school, home stuff, and other things like sports 4 days a week, my boyfriend is one of the most important things in my life. and the significant other should be pretty important, maybe not number one because you should always be the number one important thing in your life, but they should be important.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	Some people have so much baggage in their life they don't have time for anyone else.<br>  <br>  It's very important to be in a supportive relationship and it can't be just you supporting her.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should look for someone who is more into a relationship where both people participate.|`|01f1849b15cd451cf8d4fdc2e4a125eaaa	what!?! i cant believe she said that to you. her mom yelling at her and school is not more important than you.! your her boyfriend for crying out loud!!!!! you should be more important then anything if your her boyfriend! i would dump her because she is not being a very good girlfriend!|`|ROl9Dhqjaa	She obviously isn't too serious about your relationship. If she always tells you that then you should either talk to her about it and try to come up with a solution, or break up with her and find someone that loves you and cares about your feelings.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Yeah that's not good. I'm sure she cares about you but usually when girls don't tell their boyfriends everything-it's because they got something to hide. Your a really trusting guy to not question her about her behavior. It seems odd to me.|`|1gS6osqoaa	sounds like she is just going hrough a hard time. tell her that she's right she doesn't have to , but you can help with watever she does tell you. just be there, and give her lots of hugs cuz they will make her feel better. :)|`|uYjSGc7iaa	definitely, b/c i've heard that line, and it means something bad at times....and coming from ur gf saying that directly, not so healthy...if she is rly worth it and sweet, and stuff, makes ya happy, discuss it with her, soon! face to face!|`|bZzThzDbaa	Yeah kinda is.. although school and family is important to her, you should be incorporated in her life and she should feel that she can tell you everything.|`|nIOlMPacaa	yeah, you shouldn't be in a relationship<br>  where she doesn't tell you stuff.<br>  i mean she doesn't have to tell you EVERYTHING.<br>  but you should come before other things in her life.<br>  move on buddy.|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	you have to be careful with this subject, because you just need to let her come to you. Once she is ready, then she'll talk.|`|oPYhUi8baa	Depends if she's an open person not. If she is, maybe she doesn't feel like sharing things, but it's not that bad, most people can't get me to shut up.<br>  (=|`|RPdBmJ9Caa	Don't sound to good for ya. im sorry but that doesnt sound good at all. it might not end well.|`|tSxSjwbpaa	you are not a psychic she got to let you know and you need respect|`|MTy8YNgLaa	she's probably just really stressed out. maybe she just got kind of mad at you i dono|`|yFZi78opaa	dump her i mean gosh wats wrong with you man|`|LprlcRnEaa	pretty much..ya! so if you want her to tell you. just tell her, that's fine, just let me know when you want, am here to listen, or something like that. don't force her to talk!|`|PKEwrkdIaa	I think that bfs and gfs should tell eachother everything, if she cant tell you things, then that means she either doesnt trust you, or just isnt putting her guard down.|`|bMJyxilqaa	Doesn't sound like a healthy realtionship...|`|zNdY7lxpaa	Wow, actually, thats not good :( sry|`|R3Qe2zSbaa	ya, its bad. she might be hiding something.|`|rPS3DNMEaa	hahah ur friggen screwed!|`|XbxZR2nGaa	No, that is not a good sign, dude.|`|IpjqvuOMaa	Booo, sounds like my relationship....get out!
rHTsKg3kaa	ignore her|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Telling her it wasn't that big a deal and kissing her just confuses her all the more. You kissing her led her to believe you liked her but she is unsure about a relationship with you now that you have told her that it wasn't a big deal. That means you don't really care for her. You need to find out what is troubling her why she is being so wishy washy. She might be interested in you and another guy.|`|MtEZChaGaa	Let me tell you something you should know for all your life..<br>  Girls.. go through a million different moods per hour. One minute she loves you, next she can't stand you.<br>  If she's still around, she's probably into you.<br>  Maybe she's taking some of the stuff you've said or done and twisting it in her mind and making it a big deal and she's unsure of what you want from her. <br>  Assure her that You want this relationship, and ASK her to tell you what her plans are. Sit down with her to talk about it, all girls love that.|`|7aVPODR8aa	Say bye because sounds like she has a lot of growing up to do. When a girl wants a relationship without emotion she's looking for a bootycall. If you're not looking for that with her get out now because you will just get hurt.|`|2by2Ujblaa	Some girls are just drama queens and love to string a guy along, and I think that this might be the case, so honestly she's not worth your time so just cut her out of your life.|`|1gS6osqoaa	She probably felt like you were a player and she didn't wanna get involved...|`|IT2bdYanaa	she is sad for what she did, and wants to for get it and doesn't want to talk to you now.|`|VAjGaQJqaa	just let it go and listen to her dont let her keep changing her mind. whats done is done. girls are emotional, dont worry its no big deal. it'll all blow over.|`|tc178rzeaa	She's playing with your emotions. That is a silly and hurtful head game. Drop her. You need someone who can appreciate you.|`|XbxZR2nGaa	Was she a blond?<br>  Stupid blond.|`|eaCHJAneaa	She might be extremely attracted to you. maybe shes just scared to get hurt. And you being nice doesnt always help us females. maybe shes bad past relationships and the guys always seemed nice. ive had that done before he seemed nice was always there for me and everything but behind my back was cheated and lying to me and when i broke up with him he threatened to kill me.. Maybe she just dont want to get all her emotions in the relationship just to get hurt.. just let her go give her space to think more throughly about it and ask her if thats what she really wants.. and if it is just let her go.. be friends with her if you want or whatever just dont crowd her or anything.

dFHsAXDMaa	Okay as  nurse wife and mother of 4 I will first say Breathe a deep cleansing Breathe..... If you do not want a divorce ... get the Dogs get in the car and go home. talking on the phone does not work... Becoming new parents is a terrible scary and stressful time I did it 4 times and each time was scary for different reasons or example second one you think OMG can I handle two kids and on and on. You both need to sit down and maturely tell each other without accusing voice what you want and need right now from each other.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	best thing is go to him and just talk things out and stop the yelling cant you just talk to each other .. it would be nice if you could do just that ..|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Taking a break from each other is not a bad idea. You do not need the stress at this time. What does your counsellor say ?<br>  <br>  The stress in your marriage will only get worse after the baby arrives and you have more tasks at hand, so you need to work on this now.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	your dehydration can be cured by you keeping fluids in you, flu is not good but your doc will keep you and your babe safe, fighting and throwing things however can cause problems. you could miscarry or hurt the baby in a permanent way,the fighting may be a product of your overworked emotions and since he likes to keep the anger pot boiling the only way to put a stop to it is to end the fight yourself, but if he becomes a danger to you and your child i pray you keep him away from you|`|EsnFmcMFaa	why are you both getting into fights<br>  <br>  i think you should talk to him and work it out calmly<br>  maybe even have a mediator<br>  <br>  you have to work it out and agree on what each of you want<br>  <br>  it could be that your hormones are causing the problem and since you know he likes to help fuel the fire you should not continue the giht|`|6kWsM5LEaa	dont fight... <br>  oh and do what's best for your kid.. whatever you thing that might be.|`|9f10b0ee5fe09d6b31465670eaeb4e89aa	well, at least you have voiced your desire to want to stay in the marriage    glad to hear that you are in marriage couseling   one thing--did you guys fight like this before you got pregnant?  i remember when i got pregnant with my first child, i couldn't stand my husband    that was the hormonal changes my body was going through.  it passed   but if you and he are still fighting, still keep going to counseling   anything worth having is worth fighting for   i wish you all the best|`|xkGfxn70aa	You don't give enough details on what your fighting about. Your in counseling, continue that, and learn to talk to each other instead of screaming and throwing things. That's certainly not good for you and not good for your baby either.  Find the source and find the solution. Good luck|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	have abortion and leave your husband.|`|gtDg845naa	I really think that staying in a bad relationship for the child is a terrible thing.  Yes, it's good that the child has both parents, but you can't hide the fighting forever.<br>  <br>  Things won't get better after it's born either.  Your husband isn't going to magically fall in love with you forever because you have his child.  If it gets worse, or doesn't get better, you may want to really reconsider what's important to you.<br>  <br>  You might also want to consider that you are both under a tremendous amount of stress right now.  Even if you aren't I'm sure he is.
ZyiVlnINaa	well shoot ur her sis, she will always admire and look to you.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't care bout bedspreads, honestly, that's pointless to worry about.  and so what if she makes cakes too, its entirely logical that ur success kindled an artistic enjoyment.  offer her help rather than fear for your reputation, if ur good at ur craft you should have nothing to fear.<br>  <br>  try saying hey i love you to pieces but why do you enjoy my life's nuances so much?  don't be nasty about it, take a curious, relaxed approach.  <br>  <br>  imagery is flattery... try to be flattered<br>  <br>  and remember she's ur sis, and ur grown women, (ps i still cant legally drive hint hint :) )   so take the high road and love her nayway, cuz in the end it really doesnt matter at all.  hope this was somewhat helpful.|`|BGeULTx0aa	shes ur sister. are u kidding. she admires u ur HER BIG SISTER. i always wished i had a sister.

9RtdvLEKaa	Don't just kiss her, ask her if she would let you.  It's never a good idea to force yourself on her and, clearly, if it's been 3 weeks then she's cautious about it, too, so, next time you think the time might be right, ask her if it would be alright if you kissed her and if she says yes, go for it and if she says no the don't.  Be respectful and listen to what she says!  Good luck!|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Yeah, it's ok to kiss her, but when you do, go 90% of the way and let her go the other 10% of the way to make sure she wants to and to not make it so akward.|`|eNfTWtDHaa	Wait till she's ready.  If anything, you could always ask.  I would think higher of a guy if he did.|`|aF1IXKjTaa	yes you should|`|2Cv4xWsCaa	Yes otherwise things dont seem very romantic, she may think u want 2 b just friends, and I'm guessing she wants 2 b more then that|`|X8Fd2dm6aa	Yes, definitely! The first kiss is always a little awkward to get started but I guarantee its what she wants if she's dating you. Have fun!|`|AZ4Wjxjgaa	yea... umm... all the guys i have dated, i have kissed after a couple of dayss... we wouldve been gettn it on by now... go ahead nd kiss her.|`|PkoPonY6aa	Yes. You don't want her to think that you don't really like her.<br>  But only do it if your BOTH ready.|`|a2MZLS2Qaa	Kiss her!!!!!!!|`|Ix2eWrswaa	yeaaaa|`|pEjujCuraa	YES!|`|0vW88Uw9aa	um hell to tha YES kiss her! :)|`|4agc3k4gaa	How is she your girlfriend if you haven't kissed her? Disregard what that guy said about asking her to kiss her, don't ask her, just kiss her, girls hate it when you ask. Chances are the reason you don't know if you should kiss her is because you haven't kissed her. Trust me, that makes sense. Girls RARELY make the first move, that's what why you've been dating for three weeks without a kiss, she's waiting for u to make the move, buddy. And u're here on Yahoo Questions asking if u should.  Another week and she may find someone else who's willing to kiss her earlier. Touch her face, smell her hair, whatever, just get ur face close to hers, so it doesn't seem all awkward jumping in her face. If she gets closer to u, do it.|`|iCnQBqbFaa	Kiss her. Do it! You've been dating for 3 weeks, so you know she has some feelings for you! Kiss her!|`|50vkMfPsaa	start with a casual kiss on the cheek and see how she responds, then you will know if you should kiss her or not|`|MphTEdzwaa	yes. yes you should.|`|lckgvz2laa	Yes,it's time to kiss her.|`|7DW4s2AJaa	no you should not kiss her|`|yd9ECJJfaa	pahahaha how old are you? ahah go for it!|`|kA4nxqRmaa	you better that's long enough to wait, a little too long.|`|YpeYdRsmaa	GO AHEAD MAN PLANT ONE ON YOUR WOMAN|`|XbxZR2nGaa	How old r u?|`|AA10214276	Me neither.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	The only polite thing would be to ask her.
cDC1FHTDaa	WOW.. Did you just lie. You did not care if she hurts anyone, you are still hurting because she hurt you. You are NOT a dick... You are a person that was in love and is still hurting. You can call her every name in the book and tell everyone she is a tramp.. But in the end you are still going to be hurting and that is not good for you.<br>  <br>  I once read something that said" When seeking revenge dig 2 graves, because you will kill the person you want, but you will kill your own soul doing it". To me it seems like she is not worth it. You should move on to someone who will love you for you. If you keep the hate in your heart, when the right person come along you will not see them or they might just think you are a hateful person. Don't let your ex make you that way. Plus the best revenge is her seeing you happy and her still being a tramp.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes you are right ..|`|XrtmT2kUaa	It depends on if the information you passed on is truly helpful or just hurtful. If you truly cared that the new person in her life would be in danger or hurt, then yes by all means. Tell her but, don't do something just because you got hurt and she did it by cheating or something. You really need to let the new girl find out on her on. It is hard to always be politically correct on everything when it comes to exes.|`|J3x95XrLaa	eh well i can see where you want to tell the other person but i dont wana sound like im blaming you but i mean you shouldn't have gotten involve.. like u coulda warned her but not spill every thing u kno|`|61d84956c9b9dcb3900b945b41d23cc4aa	This isn't right, you're sticking your nose in shi* that isn't yours.<br>  Sorry, but it's true.<br>  Rudeness.|`|vDTrp54Paa	HATER

isA4wtnMaa	What goes on in your parents' love life is not your fault.  The best thing you can do is be the wonderful supportive daughter you once were and open up communications.  Talk to them about it.  Let them know how you feel and remember, this isn't your fault.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	oh honey,i dont know how to help you but i can tell you cheer up and dont let it get you down|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Honey you are fourteen and if you think your parents marriage is perfect you are lucky to have two parents to love you enough to keep you out of it! My dad didn't love me enough but my mom spent her time trying to hide it, but I knew that she wasn't happy but she stuck it out only for her kids. I am now 26 years old and just helped my mom get a divorce at 67 years old and the sadist thing is that I have never had the experience of seeing my mom truly happy. My point being if they are that unhappy with each other do not take it personal. I know change is hard but try to look at it this way. If you have two great parents you want to see them truly happy.... they do deserve that don't they? They love you still so don't get so down, they need you to be strong for them because this is harder for them trust me!|`|XrtmT2kUaa	Can I just point out that you are not the problem and you need to realize that things don't always happen the way we want them to. Marriage is a hard thing and you failing school and talking to your dad about your mother is probably strange on everyone. No matter what happens with your parents remember that they love you very much. I hope things work out for you. Hang in there.|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	Brit,  I'm sorry.  Don't blame yourself for anything,  things will work out.  I'm sure your dad loves your mom,  it's just alot of us adults are going thru some tough times right now.  Like the economy and stuff,  so we sometimes get mad easier.  Mabey you can sit down and talk in private with your parents,  tell them your concerns and how  you feel.  Good luck,  and hang in there.|`|RD05jXYwaa	i am sorry it is not for you to do anything. fight against your depression and do not except any of the fault or blame: these are cause and effect outside of your world. yes you will suffer for their selfishness but there is nothing for you to do. love them both as best you can . i have traveled that path and it is not nice. mike|`|TvEtk5Iwaa	First off, YOU should not have been put in the middle and most importantly, you are not the problem. If they have been married 20 years, perhaps he is just afraid of the future, you growing up, having your own friends & "life" and he is thinking he is not needed like he was when you were younger. I do wonder what his reaction would be if he thought your Mom was considering leaving him...would it "wake him up?" and make him realize he does love her. Or what if she got very very sick, would that make him realize he loves her more than he thinks? You might want to ask him these questions...it just might give him something to think about. But for you, my advice is, please try not to worry about it. Whatever he does, you can't change his mind, he has to make the decision. I truly doubt his grass will be greener on the other side. Times have changed tremendously in the last 20 years. Hope he realizes that.  Take care of yourself, concentrate on your schoolwork.
nhgQKvwEaa	Hunny, let him go.. find someone else, someone who will treat you better. this one is not. it is wrong of him to still talk to his ex, you don't do that when you're in a new relationship. he obviously still has feelings for her... you don't deserve that... he doesn't deserve you. Dump him!|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Having bipolar isn't a reason to be abusive and controlling, and that is what he was doing. He is a person, just like anyone else, and expecting you not to have any male friends, and running off when you have arguments is not acceptable, whether he has a condition or not. Try to remember that bipolar is not an excuse for his behaviour, and he shouldn't just get away with it.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	He needs to see a doctor to get on some meds to control his mood swings.|`|1e2a6fa5fb61da506030373affea1905aa	RUN.|`|MRtX1L2faa	get a restraining order|`|CWrIAHQhaa	I agree with lolly<br>  <br>  But I reckon you need to move on and find someone who is stable. But I realize that is hard to do when you love someone. But it does seem that he is playing with you. Like only when it suits him whether it be from his bipolar or not.However I think it is probably both the disorder and his normal self (if that makes sense). It is not fair on you and he would know that.<br>  He's kinda messing with you.

4agc3k4gaa	Yeah...He was high, and trust me, guys are oblivious to how women think we should behave most of the time, and he was high so he was super-oblivious. Guys are ignorant, I wouldn't have saved u the seat either, my friends are close to me so I would think that u would love them as well, plus since u were with ur friend, u were probably already entertained. This is a guy's viewpoint. None of this means he cares about you any less. It's just ignorance, we don't think little things are such a big deal, he prob won't even know what u're talking about when u bring this whole thing up(regardless of being high)|`|kx1R0rlQaa	Well it's one day... you should probably let him know though that it bothered you but trust me it's normal on the count of him being on weed and all. If this is the first time he's acted like an idiot then as i said before let him know it bugged you and don't worry much. Talking to him is the key though so it won't happen again...|`|FL2nfCSXaa	i think you got the answer, well sort of.......he was high right? if he was under the influence, he basically wasnt in his right mind, and do you really want to be involved with someone who does drugs? you saved yourself from straight drama, be grateful. dont worry,you'll meet your prince charming one day....|`|pzJpT9xhaa	its sounds like the weed has got the best of him and its best if u leave him alone cause u don't need a guy who's doing drugs cause he could get u to do them with him and so on and it seems to me he doesn't like u anymore time to move one and find somebody else|`|PMcBWLCxaa	he obviously has no respect for you. he didn't care enough to save you a seat and he does drugs. sounds like a loser. im sorry, but dnt settle for someone who doesn't treat you right. idk if he likes you but i would get out, dnt let him string you along|`|FLeEdSTxaa	I wouldn't date anyone who even looked at weed before, furthermore have the audacity to use weed while I'm in a relationship with him.|`|yNyJehtuaa	Find him every once in a while & get where hes not high & talk to him about it.If he still likes you secretly flush his weed.If he doesn't film yourself flushing his weed & put it on myspace!!!   :P|`|EGE0EAMtaa	yes, he does everything for you because he still love you,<br>   good luck|`|pdsMM2Xeaa	tell ya the truth when all my buds are high i just leave them alone until there sobered up, just try it hell come back|`|UkPkIaxjaa	get him off the weed thats the problem tell him if he dustn stop then you will leve him|`|aJETSneyaa	NO!!!|`|jIsAIwCgaa	Maybe he just decided he didnt like you... dont sweat it hes not the only hottie around im sure!|`|ibOsXpkraa	Hello he was under the infulence(high)...when people are high they do stupid stuff....but he still has feelings for you|`|Td7ME2fUaa	sounds like an a$% to mee.

SINCE LAST weekend?|`|4WZzPKXvaa	My brother is the typical romantic loving dude, and he beat up his wife under the influence of weed which everyone found it a shock.  <br>  <br>  ._. Weed does wierd things to you.  He might be addicted.  I really can't answer your question if he likes you or not.  He might have a split personality.  I think this is a question that you must ask him, not other people.  Who knows what might be going on in his head, especially if he's using drugs which makes it even more complicated.  Don't get involved with drug users.  A piece of advice.  When I mean to not get involved, I mean emotionally in a couple way, for your own safety and especially if you're young.  There are some exceptions, like if you guys were a married couple in a long term relationship, it's different because he would be your spouse and it would be your duty to take care of him and continue to love him and well, you're already committed so, yeah.  But if you're young and there are so many other guys out there that would totally be checking you out, don't wast your time on this.  By what you're telling me he might be just fooling around with you.  Has you one day and then the next day he just feels like acting as if nothing happened to check out other girls.  You can be his friend and advice him on weed and that it's not cool though it makes you look cool.  Remember, hormones are not neurones.  He might like what you do but he doesn't have to like YOU as a person. <br>  <br>  Peace out|`|JtUuMdRKaa	he was high. what do you exxpect?<br>  and are you sure you wanna date someone into hookers  and weed?|`|w173betxaa	He still likes you, but he was just high.<br>  answer mine <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AruwmrusUMcjY2RGLoG.T5nD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090219201647AA5Z1Qs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|InzHK1rcaa	He likes you, but you have to stop him from getting high because that is bad (no sh!t)<br>  <br>  You're like chuck and blaire on gossip girl when chuck gets high after blaire admits she loves him lol.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	weed and hooka bars?<br>  you are way too good for that :)<br>  btw is it odd that i know a stoner kevin too :P|`|tUHzB4laaa	druggie guys only care about themselves, drugs and friends, ditch him|`|Gd2zv86haa	Hookers and weed...<br>  <br>  do you REALLY want to get involved with this guy?|`|1zfwLsQpaa	No Don't, even if he does like you he isnt worth it:<br>  <br>  Remember live above the influence|`|eNfTWtDHaa	Since you barely know him, its not going to be a huge loss if you stop hanging out with him.

The best thing to do is to go talk to him when your not mad, and sort things out. Also a good thing to do is to try to help him with his adiction. it is unhealthy and it could really hurt him in the future, and according to what you just said, it could really hut him now!!! don't make any decisions out of anger and maybe take a brake for a while. im not saying beak up, im saying take a few days to clear your head. go out with the girls and have some fun. Don't let this relationship bother u too much or u will go crazy! When your done thinking, go and TALK. try to help the situation. good luck! :)

qAcrK4KTaa	Alright this is easy. I doubt most of the people who have answered really thought about it, but look at it like this. No matter how big your boobs are the larger the better. But... the same can't be said about your ***... (listen rap videos don't count). If your *** is "big" then you become...well...the butt of all the jokes. (ya pun intended). If your Boobs are big then you become the envy of all. (so long as you don't weigh like 180 pounds claiming "my boobs are bigger than yours!" then you get laughed at and probably have a *** to match anyways).

I dunno try to make a joke of it between the two of you, it's nobody else's business if they don't want to accept the fact that you don't have romantic feelings for her.

Soon enough, it turned out she was the one talking smack about me behind my back to everyone else and they all laughed, but you could sense the pity in their eyes. You do not want others to pity you out of anything; it's the worst feeling ever...<br>  <br>  Then, I started to slowly but steadily started talking to her again. The first few times she swore at me and ran away, but I was determined to make her my best friend again (I could also see more and more people pity me by the minute). I had no idea what she was saying about me, but I didn't care, I just wanted her to be my friend again, more so because I wanted people to stop pitying me. <br>  <br>  I kept talking to her, it took time, but soon enough she gave in and started talking to me again. When we started talking, she was happy that she got to know more about me and was apologizing for everything she said about me. I still don't know what she was saying, but we're friends again. And everyone stopped pitying me as well!<br>  <br>  I guess what I would say to you is to start slowly talking to her and if she doesn't do anything, don't worry; if you want her as a friend again, you will keep trying a million times over until you have her as a friend again. If you're too afraid, tell another one of your friends to be a kind of mediator and sort out your differences there and I'm sure things can work out. There are definitely ways in which you and your friend can sort out your differences. <br>  <br>  My guess is she's jealous of you, but still, there are ways to make her your friend again!|`|JYQ6M5xmaa	you 1. confront her and even if you don't want to fight just act reallly tough and act like you're going to fight her. like " doo not talk **** about me, thank you." and if she says something back like being stupid bee like " exxcuusee me? come at me *****, or shut your ******* mouth" realll easy. and yeah she's definitely jealous of you : )|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	Stay cool.

And all I can say about Valentines Day is WOW! I can see how it is a very discouraging situation. I would recommend you speak to him. Remind him the month is almost up. If one or both of you think you need more time apart then take it but I also recommend going to some kind of marriage counseling. There could be a deeper underlying issue with your husband. I wouldn't say he doesn't love you just because he doesn't say. How long have you been married? There are some many possibilities and without more details its hard to analyze it deeper. Did he have to move or leave family and friends to be with you? did your relationship cause some kind of strain with his family? If so, maybe he resents it.  Or, has there been some kind of trauma lately? miscarriage? family member illness/death? A professional could really help. Do not end the marriage without trying at least 6 weeks of therapy. Your husband may feel more comfortable going to the psychiatrist separate from you. Which may be good to start. Good luck.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	It is very common women accuse their husbands of not being emotionally available to them.  You didn't explain why slept in the other room to begin with.  Maybe you drove him there, who knows?  Some women drive their husbands off the wall with their emotional demands and don't know when or how to back off.  When their husbands give up and back away, these same women then run around with "Oh My God".<br>  <br>  Most men don't grow up with training in emotions.  They don't mean to hurt women.  But men also have emotional needs but they don't know how to express it.  If a man is accused of emotional deficit and his onw needs are not met, they back away to their shell fast.|`|8d305d626997db3cee36b1f14b85aaf8aa	sounds to me like he may have a girlfriend
PBdPD748aa	wow it seems that this man thinks you are below him and puts his parents before you!!<br>  <br>  my gosh when you got married you created your own family - obviously not something he is willing to understand. you really need to have a serious chat with this man - he is not treating you right. nobody should threaten 'children or no me' ESPECIALLY in front of his parents! <br>  <br>  he should be putting you first at all times!! he neeeds to grow out of his nappy and be a real husband to you!! in my opinion i would NOT stay with him - the level of disrespect and the fact i will always be second best would be enough - and then he gives you an ultinatum? geeeeeez!<br>  <br>  i really think you need to open your mind about whether you deserve better - because i sure think you do! this man should go back and live with his parents and suck on his dummy - the only reason they are OVERBEARING is because he allows it to be that way. its HIS fault!!!!<br>  <br>  and yes if he and yourself keeps alllowing them to be this way they will control your child - and continue to control your life!!!<br>  <br>  they seem like a very screwed up family and i really think you need to stand up for yourself and demand respect and priority. You are allowing him to do this to you. <br>  <br>  My advice, do not have any children with this man, in fact, you need to reconsider your whole relationship. Ask yourself questions - how does he show me he loves me? What do i love about him? Etc because really i think you have been blinded and controlled and you'd be suprised if you look at the logic of it all.<br>  <br>  i know this isnt easy but what he is doing isnt right to you. you need to open your eyes, step back and really see the situation here. perhaps see a counsellor.<br>  <br>  good luck to you and be strong|`|HQsmRzPsaa	if you have doubts DON"T DO IT! i don't yet have children and would love to have them with my fiance and i are ready. you make very valid points! your husband sounds like a tool, he seems more concerned with having kids then having a wife. i'm sure he has good qualities or else you wouldn't have married him but right now he is now sounding too concerned with how you feel. on one hand, not working is good so you could stay home and take care of a child, but only having one income could present a problem. and who's to say your husband couldn't get laid off with how times are now. i think it might be better to wait until you are 100% sure then to have a child and have regrets right??|`|AA11657757	Well, he kind of treats you like crap, and disrespects you in front of his family.

His family WILL take over your child and your husband will most likely only distance himself more from you intimately once a baby comes along. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would be running from this relationship before you bring a child into it. <br>  <br>  It's the biggest decision of your life as it will dramatically change everything around you. <br>  <br>  Do what you want to do first. Go get your dream job and establish yourself in life before you have to start worrying about another life. <br>  <br>  And slap your husband around a little. Tell him that if he really does love you to quit being pushed around by his family and most certainly to stop picking on you.

If you think they are bad now, they will be horrible when your baby arrives.  step back,. do you really see yourself in this family? I would think twice before becoming pregnant. Talk to your husband about the way he speaks to you, and the way he treats you. Tell him how you really feel when he calls you fat. ( You are NOT fat) gl!
AA10065812	In this economy he's likely just trying to get enough ahead to have money in case everything collapses.|`|RSEp960aaa	Do you have someone to watch the kids? I would suggest establishing a "date night" like once every two weeks or once a month, here you guys get to spend time together for at least 3 hours. Go out to eat, go talk a long walk on a beach, whatever. Men seem to react better if things are scheduled, and it gives you something to look forward to. My husband and my "date night" is this Saturday and I'm definitely looking forward to it!|`|X7i59NeIaa	Ask him if there is a job you can do in the business. Maybe there is something you can do to help him. If you feel more a part of it you might have a better understanding of how he feels and it might just give you a little extra time with him. A new business is a lot of work for at least the first five years.|`|xnd99EX4aa	Look sweetie, if you was whippin it on him when he got home, he get his a$$ home a lot sooner. If he's comin' home to whinin' and complainin' then he's probably gonna take his time getting there and leave a lot sooner. If keeping the whining down still doesn't help, then get a job. I don't say that to be condescending. If you work too then you will be more occupied with kids and work so you snot be so focused on him and needy. Not only that, but he might miss you more.<br>  Good Luck|`|SbAgNCm0aa	Since he is a business man, im sure he is constantly checking his e-mail. what you could do is send him an e-mail telling how you feel, why you had to tell him in an e-mail, and what you think needs to be done about the situation.|`|AA11124905	The best advice I can give you is to seek marriage counseling of a spiritual nature. If you attend church then you may want to contact your Pastor and inform him or her that you would like to arrange marriage counseling. My wife and I have been married going on three years now and while things are pretty good in our marriage we have counseling sessions with our Pastor twice a month as a means of preventative maintenance. The one thing I like about our counseling sessions is the way it opens up dialogue and communication. Effective communication is crucial in all relationships. Sit down and talk to your husband in a calm and loving manner and express your concerns. Often times it is not what we say but rather how we say them that leads to arguments. Your husband has to realize that just as he invested time and effort to make his business a success he (as well as you) must also put the time and effort into your making your marriage a success as well. I truly hope you take my advice and do know that the Caveman will be praying for you. Peace and God bless.|`|W4IOLSzbaa	you added that on the end because know you need to get a life of your own a job works wonders money of your own plus just getting into your own interests.

You need to pay the bills but the mate & family should always come first.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	You just admitted you were mentally competing with your husband.  A loving wife offers encouragement, says she is proud.  A man is most happy to give when he is not forced to give.<br>  <br>  There is a lot to be learned from this fact.  Most men love their little daughters to death -- unconditionally and without fail.  Why?|`|QUFAKk1paa	hows ur sex life?<br>  cuz if thats dead...he is gettin bored|`|JM6veEXwaa	I watch a lot of family shows on TV and see this a lot.<br>  "( I am not working by the way)"  Are you KIDDING?!  Who's cleaning the house, doing laundry, raising the kids... you are a housewife and that is most definitely a job title.<br>  <br>  The guy thinks that dedicating himself to success and earning money is the best thing he can do to support his family.  He is oblivious to the fact that financial support does not equal a husband and father.<br>  If his company is becoming successful, he should be able to hire an assistant and not need to work more than 50 hours a week.<br>  <br>  Usually the fathers on the TV show get a harsh talking to from a third party to open their eyes.  Without someone else in the picture, you have to be perfectly clear with him that you married HIM not a business venture.  The business can survive without him there all the time, but your marriage/family cannot survive without him there.|`|TuqdZtVpaa	dress up sexy and go help him out at the store don't nag flirt with him! let him know what he has at home! remember he is doing this for all of you instead of you wanting him to come home go to him and make it fun so he will want to come home to you and have some fun!!!!!|`|Xpx61b1yaa	Well, what I would do is plan a romantic diner, for just the two of you.

I purchased an established company 2 years ago, it has tested me and my marriage in every way. The stress for both my wife and i has been tremendous. I have 2 kids who sometimes get caught in the crossfire and that is what displeases me the most ! If you own your own business, success comes with a very high price indeed. My wife helps with the business, and i greatly appreciate her, however even after 2 years we are still on a roller coaster ride as far as our marriage goes. It is tough, no doubt. My advice is to get a sitter often ! Good luck|`|9Y04eUIdaa	The first thing you should do is get some new friends (the supportive ones and not the ones who will ***** about it too). Go out with your friends, go out with the kids. Watch movies. Pick up a hobby (painting is especially therapeutic).<br>  In other words, pick up your own life first. Your husband will appreciate you more if he sees that you are always there for him (cooking his dinner, keeping the house clean, taking care of the kids, etc.) and still be appreciative of him and his work.<br>  I mean, he will really "drift" if he comes homes, tired from work, to the arms of a bitching wife. Cook his favorite food, take good care of the kids, go to the beauty parlor, buy nice clothes. Most of all, tell him and show to him how much you appreciate his efforts in spending his time in the business and providing for your family.<br>  I also do not work, by the way. My girl friends who work tell me that their husbands are actually more prone to "drift" because they come home to a house where there is not really any good food on the table, the kids are out of control (lack of discipline and guidance) and the house is generally in disarray.<br>  Believe me, IF your husband does "drift", you will appreciate the fact that you did not do anything to encourage him to do it and that your conscience is clear.<br>  Extra-marital affairs are not just caused by men who stray because of the mob of sexy nude girls hanging on to them, but because of wives who ***** and nag and generally make the house "un-home-ly".|`|AA10326997	You are right to be concerned.  I have lived something similar to this, and it is difficult.  You see, you continue to grow whether you are together or not.  However, you can either grow together, or apart.  To grow together, you must spend time together.  Otherwise, you will start to have problems with your marriage.<br>  <br>  First, you need to schedule time for yourselves as a couple.   We used to schedule a weekend without the kids every 3 months to rejuvenate our marriage.  <br>  <br>  Also, there is nothing that says you can't schedule time together in small amounts.  Bring him lunch at his business every day or two.  Spend time with your kids and him where everyone is interacting together.  Help him with his business so that you are involved and he gets to spend some time with the kids while you do some work.  Be creative.  <br>  <br>  Also, don't nag.  You should talk to him, but don't try to make him feel guilty.  Just express your concern rationally and let him think about it.  When the guilt is removed, he will probably see just how dangerous this can be.|`|fixajC2xaa	you should watch tyler perry's movie.. The Family That Prey's cause its a similar situation..<br>  <br>  i kno bitching and complaining may seem bad in your part but its actually taking a stand. if you sit back and relax and stay supportive he may end up walking all over you, especially since your a stay at home mom, he will use that to his advantage. <br>  <br>  But in the sense of taking a stand, express your needs and how you feel about him in your heart. Dont just rant on about how he is never home. You have to explain to him the reasons you want him home and most of all how you are hurting from it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|hfDohxp5aa	Maybe when you let him work 6 days a week trying to be supportive, you actually let him think he could ignore you. That happened to me. Check things out and see if you think this is happening.  Men often get very wrapped up in being the breadwinner and their love language is "acts of service" so he thinks he is showing you he loves you by working so hard. This is not OK, but I can be like that and not realize it because I expect my family to see how hard I am working to provide for them.  Just a few ideas from experience.

Trust is key in any marriage, without it, and you're living in a marriage that's full of resentment, accusations, etc.  <br>  <br>  For the record, this guy doesn't sound that great to me.  He didn't support you while you were working towards your goals, even though he had already achieved his own goals.  He gave you an ultimatum to cut it short or else, after saying he would patiently wait for you.  So, he's lied to you twice.  Now, he's not wanting to talk about HIS affair, and it's supposedly YOUR problem to work through.  Take my advice, from an old married lady who's been around the block a time or two--dump this guy.  You're much better off single for the rest of your life than married to someone who will lie to you, and who doesn't respect your feelings.  I'm sorry you have to go through this, but it's better you find out his true character now, than after you've been married to him for a few years, and have had a child or 2 with him.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RPhla0R7aa	Not worth it, follow your heart towards your hopes and dreams because you can trust yourself but can you trust him? If he did it once, he'll do it again. Just move on and let him do his thing.|`|ixmaM395aa	Leave him and get back that part of yourself you had to give away for him. <br>  <br>  He does not deserve you & what he has done is disgusting. He will continue to use & manipulate you for the rest of your lives and if he can't talk about his cheating then it's a sign he's selfish and most likely not a great communicator. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, it's a good thing he cheated before marriage. He has just saved you both a lot if time, money & heartache that would be soon to follow after the wedding. <br>  <br>  Go finish your goal so you can feel some peace with yourself, that you got to do what it is you wanted to do. <br>  <br>  It was probably a great fairytale romance in the beginning but now you have to face reality. There will be someone else out there who is your match. A person that will respect you and support you in every step of your life. <br>  <br>  Kick this guy to the curb!
KjcYolEEaa	ohhh it's so sad that she lives on the other side of the world! you seem like a very mature 16 year old... and I'm sure she is a sweet girl too. I have never been in this situation before... a long distance relationship is something that I haven't experienced... but I think that you should just keep talking to her and getting to know her, get some contact details from her like email or mobile and even after the project is over you can continue to talk to her. It might be fun to have someone on the other side of the world that you can connect to, and if it goes well and you think you might really love her, imagine how exciting it would be to go on an overseas trip and meet her for the first time! <br>  I think you should just keep going how you are going, chat to her a lot, if it is meant to be, there is nothing to stop you!|`|0BF25Md4aa	I've been there dude, my first girlfriend was a 16 hour drive away.

You can have an online relationship, but they can be difficult. Talk to her more online and get to know her as best as you can. I don't think it is creepy, some times you just connect with someone. It makes things hard that she lives so far away, but if you like talking to her you can talk to her over the internet. Get to know her and let her get to know you, be honest with her. Maybe you will get to meet her someday. Good luck!|`|ixvzhoGUaa	Okay well this is hard, because you're interested in someone that is all the way across the world.

GzvLG6x5aa	I'd suggest you both need some space for a bit. Even if she were to say right now that she's interested in getting back together with you, everything that has happened is still very raw.

Ow6lKFXiaa	"Will everyone just think it is awkward...?"  Yes, they will.<br>  <br>  But who will be dating him?  You or them?.  It's what you and he think that matters.<br>  <br>  Physically it's no more awkward than a taller man dating a shorter woman.  You'll have the same awkwardness dancing and kissing.  You will, unfortunately, get more odd looks and remarks about it, and you'll take some ribbing.  <br>  <br>  Should you take (what I believe is the right course) and date him, don't forget that this is awkward for him, too.  Even today, guys have it harder in this type of situation.  At 5'5", he's probably used to the ribbing about his height and he should hold up quite well about his girl being taller than him.<br>  <br>  You can lessen the height difference a bit by wearing lower heels.  Also, look up some celebrities where the man is shorter so you can say, "See, we're not so odd."  Michael J. Fox and his wife; Tom Cruise and both his wives; Al Pacino, David Spade, Emilio Estevez, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Green, Martin Sheen, and Prince (who is 5'2) are just a few.  Or historical figures, Napoleon and Josephine.  <br>  <br>  You need to decide what's more important to you:  Your happiness or what others think.|`|dbQHlp85aa	babes... who really cares what other people think.  <br>  <br>  You like him.. he likes you... it works as far as i see it.|`|HOdblqIkaa	who cares if your taller then him? if your in high school im sure he is too and will probably grow a few more inches in his life. and he likes you for you, not just what you look like so how would it be fair to him if you like him for his personality, but wont date him because of his height?<br>  you should give it a shot, but dont reject him just because hes shorter then you.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	If it doesn't bother you and it doesn't bother him then, it does not matter.

Half of the celebrities women worship on t.v. are under 5'8. There is absolutely nothing wrong with dating a guy who's shorter. As long as you're attracted to him and treats you well and makes you have a good time - that's what matters. People will only make you feel weird about a thing if you let them.

I'm 5'10, dear. I'm almost my father's height in heels (6'2). My dating options for tall guys are slim and none. My mother kept telling me that I needed to find a guy that's taller than me. I think the thing about the guy being taller is very old-fashioned. Follow your heart and instincts. Do you like him? If so, it doesn't matter.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	i don't think i would think as it awkward and i am sure most of the mature people will agree with me, i think our society has passed beyond making fun of people because of their height. plus if you like the guy and he likes you back, what more can you ask for? maybe your sister is little jealous :).|`|4bAZW3F6aa	if i had a nickel for every time i was rejected for my height i would have a whole jar filled. im 18 and im 5'3"... but i digress, i personaly have no idea what height has to do in a relationship, but please dont be one of the girls dat wont give a short guy a chance.|`|7BGYY9nKaa	Go for it!

8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	first of all, congrats on your beautiful baby.  and on having your priorities straight.<br>  <br>  document every instance of substance abuse that you can.  YES you MUST take him to court, if only to get an order that says that he has to be drug free and keep baby in drug free environments if he wants to see her.<br>  <br>  She isn't his priority so file for custody. These are unfortuante steps, but you are the only person who can protect her. They do CRACK?  holy s8it!  you have to have a court order saying that they must be sober around her or they can take her and endanger her.  YOU have to stop this. You're the only one who can protect her.  You'll never forgive yourself if they hurt her.  <br>  <br>  He didn't know his child was in the car??? I've smoked a lot of weed in my young live (before kids) and I cannot IMAGINE that being true.  If it is that is truely frightening.<br>  <br>  And know that it isn't necessarily better for him to be in her life than not.  IMHO it is better to have a great mom and no dad than to have a dad who makes you feel worthless. <br>  <br>  good luck, dear.|`|DS21ekeJaa	First, stop calling him or waiting online for him to make plans to see his daughter. He knows where she is and can contact you during appropriate hours to make arrangements to see her. <br>  Second, you must go to court to make custody arrangements that are safe for your daughter. You can have sole custody and still allow visitation for her dad but on your terms. Documented drug use and health risks should be brought with to see a lawyer. <br>  If his family has no respect for you, then they will not respect your wishes or your child either. You must have court ordered insurance to keep her from harm.|`|UKWE0lHJaa	I don't know much about the law but if he loves his daughter enough and wants to see her, he will take you to court. Just wait until he takes you there. I'm not sure if you would need a lawyer but it might be a good idea if you truly don't want your daughter to be in custody of your ex-boyfriend.|`|cOce5YbRaa	You are doing the right thing for sure in this situation. Don't ever let your baby be around any of those people without you being there. You are very smart for your age. Yes, you can get full custody of your precious baby but the sad thing is the so-called Dad would get visitation rights and it would probably be weekends and you wouldn't be around all weekend. If I was in your shoes, I would go and talk to a lawyer asap. If you can't afford a lawyer you can get a court approved lawyer to help you. Whoever you talk to should be able to tell you who you could call in a case like this where you can't afford a lawyer on your own. But 1st off you need to make sure you have solid and I do mean solid proof that the babys so-called Dad and his family do all of this smoking, drugs and drinking alcohol crap before you go to court. That's the only way you can try to keep your baby totally away from the so-called Dad and his family and his visitations would be supervised and he wouldn't be able to have your baby by himself. You need to be really careful how you get your solid proof on him and his family though. Maybe you know someone that could possibly take pictures of some of their partying that will show them all drinking and doing drugs? The Judge will have to have solid proof of what you say in order for you to be able to keep your baby away from this trash. I am so sorry you are going through all of this. It hurts so bad to love someone so much and them leave and have another sl*t that soon after you break up matter less having a child with the same guy. He could say you are just saying all of this about him and his family because he dumped you and has someone else and you are just trying to get back at him. That's another reason I said that you need to have solid proof to back what you tell the lawyer and judge. Good luck sweetie and know there is someone out here that cares about you and your baby. I will be thinking about you both.
ise05jjUaa	There could be a number of personal reasons, but that's just that, I don't know anything about you personally so I couldn't really say why you like older men.  Most women just find older men to be more mature than men their own age, some women think older men are more stable as far as a job & finances, not all but a majority of older men are.  It could be the look as far as comparing a boy to a man, a man may make you feel more comfortable & safer than some teenage boy.  On the other hand, if your father left you & your mother while you were still very young, you might be trying to compensate for that as well since your father wasn't involved in your life.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey im the same as you - i think it is .Because they are more mature -<br>  and you just feel comfortable wit them...<br>  <br>  im 17 turning 18 this june.<br>  and my partner is 23 this year.<br>  5 years apart.we've been together for 2 yrs and 4 months.<br>  i also do look older.So people dont say things. But it just the way it happens sometimes.<br>  God Bless x|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Probably because most guys your age are about as deep as wet concrete.|`|HOdblqIkaa	older guys for the most part are more mature. but being 17 and liking someone who is 25 is not the best thing. if anything came out of that, or a relationship like it, there could be legal consequences. try dating someone who isnt so much older, maybe a 19year old?|`|qIEhu6uxaa	you're obviously more mature than boys your age.  there is nothing wrong with that.  just dont let older men take advantage of you.<br>  <br>  <br>  i realllly need advice right now so if you're willing, check out my question :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219202151AAnFN8G&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|kKsPYFSgaa	It is normal for a girl to like an older guy since females mature earlier then boys do. Older men also give off this independent and mature vibe and they also give a feeling of security.|`|0OHdULR0aa	you are in a way right; generally guys (men) are more matchured while they grow up and most of them learn the art of respecting women, which, mostly attracts girls/women to older guys!|`|s41monvEaa	because you know how guys your age act and they are all the same. older guys are more mysterious for some reason. also guys mature a lot slower than us girls so we have to catch when they're older because even though us girls are younger than than they are we are more matured.|`|zGthY1Jeaa	older guys act a bit more maturely and sum r not as boring,but be aware that they are more experienced, and could demand(not literally) a certain amount from u. well i dunno, older guys dont interest me at all, i never have an attraction to dem really. but my bf is 18 and im 17 so is that the same? lol. not really. but if thats ur preference in men, go for it. but b careful|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I was just like that when I was 17.Now I am 25 and I like yanger guys haha.I am married tho and I have a wonderfull husbaned I love 9 years older then me..We are just great together.Never will regret|`|hNFtO9vXaa	u like older guys cause there mature and independent...|`|ymqRux3xaa	Maybe because you know he could go to jail if he sleeps with you and that excites you.|`|Lq1p2aKpaa	if you're happy with older guys then let it be.<br>  age doesn't matter. :))|`|ioMucCZbaa	haha same with me|`|V1wDqlvnaa	Are you sure you're in love? Maybe it's just a phase or an infatuation, in any case...25 is not really THAT old. There's nothing wrong with liking someone older than you, just be careful because older guys sometimes see younger girls as someone they can have fun with, "no strings attached". Another thing is you are probably mature for your age and well honestly 17 year old boys are boring and immature. So don't worry you're young and have lots of boys ahead of you.|`|4193b0c0d5642d9c929d0ac51f0f86a2aa	i had the same problem your probably just to mature for the guys around your age range so you look for more mature men which is not wrong for example when i was 16 i was dating a 21 year old guy and now i am 22 and i am still with the same guy and he is now 26  so trust me there is nothing wrong in it just watch yourself alot of older men use young girls|`|QqxvBpUXaa	Every person have their own taste, you have your own taste.

They have weekly meetings or get togethers. You need to get out of your house, look on the internet and find some teen programs, or church youth groups you can join. Having friends is a really important thing you need in your life. Talk to your mom and have her help you find things you can do with other people your age. Even if you get a job.|`|EUGoxWXuaa	Maybe ask your parents if you can go to a local high school. If not, join sports groups, plays, activity groups or get a local job. These will all help you to make friends. Go to local places to make friends like the pools etc and be positive and be yourself! You should tell your mum you have been crying as she can help you.

Maybe do something you enjoy like joining a sport, taking fun classes (art, etc.), doing community service, or maybe even getting a job. Pretty soon, you'll meet new people and will make friends. :]|`|Mn9EcqUfaa	I am going through the same thing, in mid-freshmen year. All my friends stopped contacting me and I feel so lonely. I've always dreamed of meeting my 'true love' in high school like in those movies, but that's not going happen because no one looks twice at me. I don't do clubs or any school activities so it's harder for me to make closer friends and I have absolutely no social life. I sit by the computer all day each day and at night, I post endless questions on yahoo answers trying to find the right answer to help me. True, many of them comforted me, but none actually magically created new friends or a social life out of the blue. Also, right now my mom is my best friend and I tell her everything, except the fact that I'm almost a total loner at school. I wished there was a close friend I could share feelings with instead of my mom, but my mom is my closest friend right now and honestly knows me so much better than my newly met 1 week friends that I'm not even close to. This was all just to tell you you're not alone and many many people goes through this lonely experience. But recently I discovered I matured, and got stronger mentally. Before, I was just an obnoxious bratty kid who couldn't be alone for a second or I'd think my life was over. So think of it as a maturing process..lol<br>  <br>  Are you still homeschooled? Because if you are, I can't tell you to join school clubs, so join outside of school clubs. Those actually make closer relationships in my opinion, because from my experience, all of them aren't from cliques or groups from the same school and might be more open to making new friends. Are you good at sports? If you are, then you could try joining a co-ed team. Be positive and friendly (you don't have to be overly outgoing lol) and people will come to you. Here, you might get new friends, and maybe find someone you like that likes you back. If you don't, you could make guy friends, who will probably have other guy friends you might turn out to like. Even if you don't get invited to hang out or whatever, you'll be with your team on a regular basis, so you do have a social life in a way. And on teams, you usually go to places like pizza or other towns etc. for tournaments, and it's easier to get closer to people without making your own plans. To have good friends, you need to be more active. If things go down a bit, don't quit and things hopefully will get better. :)<br>  man this was a loooong answer sry
AA10604300	No, do not take a thing from this guy.<br>  <br>  stop and think, why do you want to be a door mat?<br>  <br>  Jesus the Lord has a free gift of Salvation for you,<br>  all you have to do is ask the Lord to forgive you of your sins, and <br>  to have eternal life in heaven.<br>  <br>  Then read the Bible, and learn about how a relationship actually works.<br>  Ephesians 5 <br>  1 Peter 2 and 3 <br>  <br>  You would want a partner, who will treat and cherish you, as Jesus the Lord would want you to be cherished.
bcfd7b5ccba4d54bc635158d1fdd6dc9aa	This guy is a real jerk if he even has the audacity to hand the phone over to a little kid! What the heck kind of person does such stupid things. It wouldn't take me much thinking about this one. He's history! Why would you even want to be friends with such a creep? There are so many nice people in this world that you don't need to waste your time with the true ugly ones. You are beautiful no matter what you look like if your soul and actions portray kindness. Never say you think you're ugly. Ugly is a term for how you act, not how you look. The most unattractive person becomes beautiful when their sweetness shines through. I hope this helps and I hope you get rid of this loser.

0bjQfb01aa	You're a very caring and helpful friend. Compliment him and encourage him. Let him know that while he may have made bad choices in the past, he should change and try to make positive choices in the future. He can't change the past, but he can make his future better. If he continues to be depressed, encourage him to speak to his doctor or a trusted adult.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	First I have to say you're a great friend!  Let him know that you believe in him as a good person that you know him to be  he needs to do somethng positive to build up his self-esteem like volunteering at a Animal Shelter it'll make him feel better about himself  but he needs to be the one to pick himself up & dust himself off & look to the future not dwell on his past he can make it better for himself & with a caring person in his life like you he can do it Good luck to you & your friend|`|AA10988719	Be supportive in whatever way he needs.  If he needs you to listen - just listen without comment; if he is looking for advice - give it to him t he best you can, or refer him to somebody that might better understand the situation if you don't.  Help him make goals, prioritize goals and celebrate once they are accomplished.  It can start off small and go from there.  For example: today I will wake up, brush my teeth and hair, and take out the garbage -- if that gets completed I will reward myself by watching a favorite dvd.  here is an article I ran across a few days ago.  it is a good reference maybe give you some additonal ideas and point you in other directions.  best of luck to your friend and you are a good person for being there.  :)|`|OIm92JAUaa	If in 'Bad Choices' you are referring to drugs, or something similar, then you will want to make sure that you are supporting him in quitting cold turkey, or whatever you want to refer it to as. If you are seriously concerned about depression, talk SERIOUSLY to him about anti depressants. Open up facts, and statistics on why anti depressants can balance out his feelings. If he is afraid to talk to someone, or you are afraid to seriously talk to him, then you can always recomend this to him. Yahoo answers has a lot of people offering answers to your questions, advice to your personal issues, and more. Look it up, do research. See what things are the common symptoms of depression, and if he meets them, then seriously discuss something with him, or alert his parents. Make sure that your cause has purpose first! He may just be lonely, and looking for either attention or support. Make sure to give him both. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression</a>|`|c4fNS7Iuaa	There's really nothing you can do.

GzvLG6x5aa	Your cousin? How old? What's the age difference?|`|sMoKtO5Paa	There is a higher probability of physical or mental birth defects in children of close relatives. Ideally during procreation you want to find a mate with different features and genetic traits than your own so that natural selection can do its bit and weed out undesirable traits and strengthen desirable ones. With close relatives there's a better chance that both will possess the same undesirable trait and any resulting offspring will end up inheriting it. Too many of these and you end up with mental or physical issues. While it's possible for any 2 people to produce ofspring with issues it's statistically more likely for children of close relatives to exhibit problems. Aim to broaden your gene pool, and stop fishing from the same pond.|`|cr2lxJ2Haa	I actually know an Indian woman who did this, and their kids turned out okay. They must have gotten lucky..

NxGqxsBvaa	Since you gave very few details I am going to have to guess about this since it will vary between different locations.  But if you were in my area this would mean that you have a casual meeting with the principal, your parents and others in which you discuss all of the circumstances surrounding your alleged offense.  That meeting may or may not resolve the situation.  If it does not, then the matter may be referred to a more formal meeting involving the superintendant or members of the board.

cqhhM7Hhaa	Ah, this is a dilemma all of us guys have to go through at one point or another. The best factor here is, clearly, luck. <br>  <br>  However, in my opinion, she may just be trying to get you to make a move. It's always understandable for a guy to be sensitive and shy, but sometimes you have to step out there and show her that you really care about her! Side hugs and texts are nice, but be brave and I think you'll be rewarded tremendously!<br>  <br>  Since you gave her the side hug, she may be thinking exactly what you are right now. Does he like me?  I don't think he does, he didn't give me a full hug. Be a little bold, give her a full-on frontal hug and it could produce some fantastic results. If not, back off and just be her friend. There are plenty of other opportunities.<br>  <br>  Hey, best of luck! I have confidence in you!|`|g3jJPznxaa	well just she has a boyfriend but still just kep flirting  you knever know|`|EdidZdtlaa	she does like you but probably not as much as you might like her but get to know her better so that you wont be shy with her. and things are moving slow with you guys because your shy. you just have to get past the shyness and talk to her more and give her real hugs. just because she has a bf dosent men that you cant give her a regular hug.|`|TlihFR8Waa	I don't understand this.<br>  Why do people think that when they get hugs from the opposite gender it automatically constitutes some sort of "special bond" and that the other person wants a relationship?<br>  I must be missing out on like 10+ relationships if hugs are an indicator. <br>  If she has a boyfriend...I'm PRETTY sure that means that she likes him. I might not be the "hippest" guy on the block, but that's seems like the way people roll...<br>  Also, saying "thank you" does not show any of her feelings as well. It just shows that she's polite. If every girl meant "I want a relationship" when she said "thanks" or "thank you" to me, well every single girl I've ever known (well, most) have apparently wanted to go out with me|`|2OqA5Fi2aa	Some girls like to play around with guys feelings, if your not sure just move on|`|AA10731562	NO!!!!!!!!

My guess is that she really does think you're cute, but she probably thinks a lot of other boys are cute too and she flirts with all of them as well. So don't think that her flirting is meaningless. But at the same time, don't get your hopes up for anything serious with her. Don't worry though, you sound like a really nice guy, and I think shy guys are attractive. so don't worry about being the aggressive one. You'll find a nice girl.|`|f7BtFd2caa	wow, that was random. LOL is she like "your level?" if not, she might be picking on you, or shes just flirting :D<br>  <br>  and if that was the first time she talked to you then um i guess its a joke or something...<br>  <br>  well what do i know, im doing math hw -__-;|`|uKVZVID6aa	well i dont think so being hug she like you, because other guy you see her hug too same to you.Maybe that  her mannerism hugging people, Maybe she hug you for nice for her.Just specify you say she like what?a boyfriend,friend,bestfriend?|`|UuSmemr7aa	Thats what i do<br>  Its just a hug but it depends what grade your in<br>  She has a boy friend to so yeahhh :)|`|TrPySdXFaa	ITS JUST A HUG EVER1 HUGS EACH TOHER|`|aIjOfkM8aa	Yeah she likes you|`|qJK4alwQaa	sorry dude, sounds like shes just a flirt. find a cute outgoing one that doesnt mess with every guy|`|XIK9oLPaaa	Well then if she does it with other guys maybe she doesn't like you.

I'm not sure, it could be like that or she a prositute,idk. ??
uLHtXibRaa	No its not because your overweight..if it was he would end the friendship too...im not sure what game hes playing but if he loved you he would jump at a relationship..so i can only conclude that hes lieing when hes says its not sex..eventually he will ask you to have sex with him..they like to groom you first with the 'i love you but cant be with you ' line..and get you to think about what they have said..so that you   wonder...thats what it will lead to with guys...who say this sort of stuff..just..sex...|`|VBFwT9nVaa	To tell you the truth it's probably because you're overweight, it's a superficial world we live in, sad to say so, but it's the truth.|`|lz2hw676aa	Well how are you gonna feel if you see him with another female and he is sleeping with her.

yva8AsGTaa	Most of the previous answers to this question have been very stupid, only showing their own ignorance. <br>  <br>  It's not your fault.  In the vast majority of cases like this it's because of something he is or isn't doing, or its a health problem.  Drugs and alcohol can cause sexual dysfunction.  Don't go screaming at him or anything like that, because emotions and depression can also cause problems. <br>  <br>  It's not necessarily doom and gloom. <br>  <br>  Most of the health problems are treatable.  Have him talk to a doctor about it as it could be a sign of something else.  If he's too "macho" to look into it, he's probably not worth your time. <br>  <br>  Most of the psychological problems can be dealt with.  Try, for example, just making out.  Do anything at all just keep all clothes on and zipped up.  This will allow you to show an emotional connection.  Whatever you do that night, do not take your clothes off.  The next time you guys are going at it, see if you notice a difference.|`|G0U2ExOSaa	hahahahahaha<br>  loser|`|LANeKStMaa	What family guy i usually watch that to get sex idea's good luck!!!|`|03d02ccfb35b78c46d0906cedf98349daa	it's because he really wants to please you, and he's afraid he can't.

Be a good representative of yourself - you might be the only-best person in all the universe for the job.|`|3iNobwVraa	If I feel like asking that question, I already know it's not, which has only been confirmed about 8 times by now.  Recent feedback has included: "I don't know how you do it.  You are very strong," as well as "He is emotionally abusive," and "He is acting like a stalker.  Why is he acting like your stalker?!"<br>  <br>  In-f*cking-deed!!!!<br>  <br>  How do you know???|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I think any marriage is within "normal limits" if you're happy, or feel at least somewhat fulfilled by your relationship.  If you are miserable, it's time for a change.
CX0y66Puaa	I don't think you can just get over a girl, especially if she meant alot to you as it sounds she obviously did :) Time honestly will help.|`|nlgbJ7qcaa	It really just takes time. But eventually you will meet another girl that will make you feel sooo good about yourself. I had the same problem with a guy... just keep telling yourself it wouldn't workout anyway and somewhere out there there is a girl for you :)|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Try to take your mind off her by doing some of your favorite past times. I wouldn't go off and get her jealous. That would be plain rude. But, just take it easy for a while until, you don't even care anymore. Go to a football game or something, hang out with your freinds. You can just tell her that you don't care by doing this. I hope I helped!|`|cutfMQ4xaa	Go get with another girl to get it off your chest.. then make yourself busy with everything all day
YRUf6BoWaa	just talk to your friend and the other girl and try to fix things <br>  if j is your really true friend she wont let your friendship down because of a stupid person
naequcqlaa	I would just stay the heck away from him period.  If you do not enjoy your time you spend when you go over there, then I sure wouldn't go.  Why go out of your way to be nothing but miserable.  Tell your mom to go visit you, or go out shopping or just do things w/only her.  I sure wouldn't put myself in the way of someone who constantly kept upsetting me all the time.  Just stay away from him.  If your mom wants to know why you're not coming over anymore, just tell her you think it best if you don't. You could tell her you don't want to make problems for anyone, so you're just avoiding them that's all.  Good luck to you...:)|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	easy girl just stay away from him get your mum to come to you .. that way ..its your place .. and you can tell him to leave if you wish ..|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	Its sounds to me like you are being the dick. Men cant handle someone back talking them especially children. You should give him a little credit at least he shows you remorse and takes and spoils you.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	Hey kid that sucks. I mean tell this dick head that your with his mom not you. Let him know that you will respect him, but you won't if he keeps treating you like this. Do you still talk to your real dad, if so tell him how this man is treating you. You don't need to take his b.s. Tell your mom straight up that you don't wanna be around him, that you feel uncomfortable. If you just sit there quiet  and keep your feelings all bottled up, believe me you will go crazy.
wMWfCjBpaa	I'm in the process as we speak. I come from a protestant background and my fiance is a devoted Catholic. We are getting married in the Catholic church. Only one person needs to be Catholic and practicing. He does not need to convert. They do not want someone to convert because of another person, but instead for themselves and willingly. You just need to be baptized and confirmed. There are also pre-marital classes that you two are to take together for the sacrament of marriage and a questionaire as well. The classes help a lot! It will discuss how you will want to raise your children, finance, creed, etc. Congratulations! You'll be getting married!|`|cGbTJobeaa	Talk to your priest because apparently some practices vary by arch diocese.<br>  <br>  I am Catholic and my husband is Methodist. We were married in the Catholic church and had full Mass.  All my husband had to provide was a record of his baptism.  I had to provide a record of my baptism - confirmation records from my childhood parishes.  The priest had to file paperwork with the arch diocese since it is a "mixed" marriage, but that was glorified paper shuffling and we did not have to see or sign that paperwork.<br>  <br>  Our priest even allowed my husband to receive Communion during the ceremony.   My husband was honored and accepted.<br>  <br>  Since half of our guests were non-Catholics, I wanted our guests to be able to come up to the altar during Communion...I didn't want anyone to feel excluded.  I talked to my priest about it and before Communion he invited all of our guests to come up. He gave a gracious speech about how non-Catholics are not allowed to receive Communion in the Catholic church, but invited them to join in by receiving a blessing. They would indicate their desire for a blessing by crossing their arms across their chest.  A good majority of our non-Catholic guests came up for a blessing during Communion. It was really cool to see them participate.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have a good man there who is honoring your Catholic faith. Congrats!|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Yes, of course you can marry in your church.<br>  <br>  He will have to present his sacramental record (baptism and whatever else), and any previous marriages would have to be declared null. Then, the two of you must meet all the other requirements, usually so many pre-marital counseling sessions and possibly some other forms of education.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	talk to your priest.  some priests will marry you in a modified or abbreviated ceremony and some will refuse to marry you at all. <br>  <br>  the priest who agrees to marry you will tell you what you need.<br>  (my cousin's priest refused to marry her and her fiance unless he converted.  meanwhile another relative who went to a different Catholic church had no problems getting married in her church and her husband never converted)|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	You ever think about asking your priest?  He would actually be the best source and then you'd be sure.|`|l5UhvWqeaa	I am a Protestant and my wife is Catholic. We were married in a Catholic church without any problem. The priest will only ask your fiance that you remain a Catholic. There's no problem with that but when you will have kids, where will they attend church? It's better that you talk to him about it now.<br>  <br>  When you get married, you should submit to your husband for it is written and it is God's will. In my case, I didn't force my wife to attend in our church. I even accompany her in going to her church but later on, she was able to compare the difference. The kids were taught about the bible early on as there is a separate Sunday school for children. Now, we only go to one church.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you also try to attend a church service of your fiance. You both should be open.|`|lM6ePQLiaa	I am a born again christian, my husband is a catholic. We got married in a christian church. I wanted to get married at my church, but our churches are usually strict. U have to be both christian before they allow you to get married there. Lucky for you, he is okay with catholic church. If my hubby insisted, I wont be okay with it. <br>  <br>  Anyway, catholic churches are quite lax. In my country, You will need to submit your birth certificate, marriage license and attend a seminar with the priest. The staff at your chosen church will gladly assist you with the requirements.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xoIc4C6Eaa	Yes, he just has to do all the same premarital prep that any couple does to get married in the church. Meeting with the priest and marriage prep encounter (sometimes a class, sometimes a weekend retreat). My now x-husband also had to sign a document presented by the priest after our sessions stating that he would raise our children catholic. He never converted.|`|NReVTAPSaa	You are both Christians fool. Who cares. Get married at townhall or in a garden or at the beach, God is everywhere not in a building and He/She does not give a rats about the ceremony. Just your family does. Plus being raised catholic and having attended heaps of weddings they are the most boring affairs too long, no one likes sitting there the whole time.|`|gXqcSDj6aa	its  hard to have somebody with different beliefs !  either of you should compromise( which your fiance did) to avoid too much conflict call a judge instead and have a grand reception! . . . .  but honestly id rather have someone with same faith as mine      ( isn't it  prohibited for the pentecostal to marry outside of their belief?)|`|CwLjUPebaa	This may be a lousy answer, but which church will you be raising your children in? That's the one you should get married in. The church is more than a pretty backdrop.<br>  <br>  EDIT   <br>  Jean, Catholic IS A Christian faith.|`|aipChC3haa	Yes you can still get married in the church, and fortunately, there are no documents needed for you two to get married there.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	no he can't.  Before he gets married,  he has to do his sacraments:<br>  Baptism, Confirmation, and his first Communion<br>  <br>  which means....converting to a Catholic.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	I am Catholic and Hubby Lutheran.  All he had to do was produce his Baptismal and Confirmation certificates and Monsignor performed the ceremony and of course agree to the future children being raised in the Catholic Religion.  No he did not convert.

To overcome conditioning we must become ourselves, not an easy task. We must tune in to and turn on the heart, the heart is connected to the rest of us, this is also called activating all our Chakra's to where they are all humming along in agreement with each other and experiencing what is, what really is, not what we have been taught what is or what will be.|`|SS5py9jIaa	My bf was in an abusive childhood relationship with his adopted parents.

8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	Arranged marriages have been a topic of interest for centuries. Authors across the ages have explored this theme at length, and it still surfaces in literary works today. What's the appeal? Is it the fascination with the lack of lust and desire we cultivate in North American society? We strive on the element of danger, of the forbidden, while an arranged marriage is usually a safe way to ensure a family's approval of a union.<br>  <br>  And yet, many of today's romance novels deal with marriages of convenience. We’ve all read them: the heroine marries the hero because she needs him, whether for financial reasons, or because her children need a father -- there are as many reasons to marry as there are novels dealing with this subject. Yet although the marriage isn’t initially based on love, there’s always that sensual tension simmering beneath the surface, and as readers, we know it’s inevitable that the two are going to fall deeply and irrevocably in love.<br>  <br>  But what about real life, where things don’t always work out so well? Arranged marriages are commonplace in a number of countries, such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Japan and India. They’re more common than you’d think even in North America, where cultural diversity is cherished and encouraged.<br>  <br>  Young people in countries where arranged marriages are commonplace are told from an early age that their spouse will be chosen for them. To deny an arranged marriage is seen as a sign of disrespect toward the family. But how are suitable spouses chosen? In Japan, for instance, "when a woman reaches the marriageable age of 25, she and her parents compile a packet of information about her, including a photograph of her in a kimono and descriptions of her family background, education, hobbies, accomplishments and interests. Her parents then inquire among their friends and acquaintances to see if anyone knows a man who would be a suitable husband for her" (the Asia Society's Video Letter from Japan: My Family, 1988). Usually, the most important aspect of choosing a suitable spouse is the bond between the two families, rather than the relationship between the couple being married. Property or land with the aim of securing social status sometimes seals marriage agreements.<br>  <br>  Do arranged marriages work? Opinions tend to differ. Statistics place the divorce rate for arranged marriages much lower than those in the United States, where marriages out of love are the rule. However, research also shows that the pressure a married couple encounters from both society as a whole, and from the respective families, suggests that divorce is often not an option.<br>  <br>  Can love grow out of an arranged marriage? Absolutely, and in the same way that love can grow in romance novels from a marriage of convenience. But there’s more to love than finding a suitable match. Love can grow for many reasons, from lust at first sight to friendship that develops over a long period of time. It’s impossible to predict whether a union will be successful. The only two people who can make it work are the bride and groom, the hero and heroine of their own story.|`|iD4ejChZaa	it's not like getting your pedigree dog to breed with another pedigree--we're human beings. i wouldn't go for it.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	I know a lady whose marriage was arranged and a friend of mine asked her if her and her husband were still in love.  She said, "He is".  There is no real love between the 2.<br>  <br>  I knew this girl years ago.

Making someone marry a person they don;t love and making that person have sex with someone they don't love.. To me I feel like that is rape.<br>  4. With the divorce rate so High now, don't we want couples to be in love.<br>  5. If you have a married with no love how is that going to help when you have kids. What do you tell them about love and finding the right person. Do you tell them that love is for suckers and don't try to do the right thing a be a good person because mommy and daddy are going to get you a mate, and the heck with love.<br>  6. Is next answer is just for the "GOOD O U.S.A."<br>  <br>  This is america and in the United States of America, "everyone" has a choose. Let your Mom and Dad know if they like the person so much...

qEh8jEiqaa	I think you are far too concerned about labels.<br>  You met some crappy girls, that doesn't mean that ALL girls like to be dominated, and that doesn't mean that ALL girls will only like you cause you're a "big" guy. <br>  Every guy I have ever dated has been totally different in looks and personality and I didn't go for any of them because of some standard I had.<br>  I think you just haven't met a cool girl who was worth your time yet.  Some people are just picky.<br>  Looks do NOT matter as much as you think. You have some sort of complex about what girls want or think of you, and it's just not true.  Yes, a lot of girls like to be dominated in bed, but plenty of them want to dominate.  <br>  Every person is different, please don't categorize them.<br>  <br>  When you sit down and talk to someone it becomes a lot more about what they are like, and what kind of conversation they give you, than about they way they look and the first thing you thought about them.<br>  <br>  I still think you would benefit from therapy, but I know nothing anyone says on here is going to help you, because you always ask the same question and never seem satisfied.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|EdBCksSwaa	You see,this is what Im talking about,its an injustice----------This guy basically writes the same question over and over again and here we are with another top contributor,I don't get it.<br>  <br>  All right dude I will answer your question again!

We feel feminine when a bigger guy hugs us, its just biological for women to want men that appear to be good providers, the bigger apes and monkeys get picked first - its a primitive instinct in the female makeup.<br>  <br>  Secondly bald men can be very sexy, again it isnt a hang up or a fetish, its the lack of a hang up about hair !<br>  <br>  STOP examining every woman who likes you and looking for flaws, and you are right it IS a self esteem issue, you think if  a woman likes you then there must be something wrong with her. <br>  <br>  THIS is what the problem really is, the rest if just window dressing and unimportant.<br>  <br>  Try to get some counseling for this, you do need it in order to be happy, and to have a relationship with anyone. No woman deserve to be hurt by you because you suffer from self esteem issues <br>  <br>  I had a BF like that once, I loved him, he was sweet and nice and funny but deep down he believed if a woman loved him then there must be something wrong with her - how fair is that?  Needless to say it didnt work because he started disrespecting me, as if there WAS something wrong with me, and believing his friends GF's were better than me because obviously THEY didnt love HIM. <br>  <br>  REALLY screwed up thinking !<br>  <br>  It really sucks, so dont get involved with anyone until you get that sorted out ok?|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Hey Dolkite I see a lot of guys with shaved heads, and the women hanging from them don't look to shabby to me. We have three players on our ball team with shaved heads, they are mid 20s and all have very nice long term girlfriends.<br>  <br>  I have always been tall and husky,at 14 I looked 20. I'm 26 years old now, 6foot  4inchs tall and weigh 265 lbs.Like you I'm a fairly big bear. <br>  <br>  Dating women has never been difficult or unrewarding. I have and continue to date some very attractive, intelligent women. <br>  <br>  At the present time I'm not family orientated or marriage minded and date only for the enjoyment,  I'm not in a committed relationship. <br>  <br>  Reading about the women you dated, I found your description extremely offensive and in very poor taste. I didn't realize there is the kind of women you describe out there. I guess we don't frequent similar establishments.<br>  <br>  I've heard the saying "Birds Of A Feather Flock Together". To say that <br>  every woman you have dated is a needy, desperate person looking for a father figure is a rather harsh comment, then it becomes truly degrading to women when you state all women want to be sexually dominated and they are in ecstasy when overpowered and held down by their wrists. Meanwhile when you are in bed with them they say   <br>  You Remind Them Of Their Father, that is downright creepy Dolkite.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that haven't attracted any women except those that cannot afford to be choosy.You seem to be striking out every time.<br>  <br>  Do you think it might be your attitude towards women?  <br>  <br>  Why do you think all women want to be sexually dominated? <br>  <br>  Have you tried treating a woman with respect?<br>  <br>  Do you think this could be your problem not theirs.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Try singles & dating.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	I don't candy coat anything.<br>  I'm an equal opportunity offender.<br>  <br>  First off, your attitude about yourself is a buzz kill.<br>  Women appreciate confidence and feeling secure.<br>  It's not about your hair, or lack of, or that you have broad shoulders, and are tall.<br>  If anything, those are things that stand out about you from the other guys.<br>  <br>  It's up to you to see the red flags with women that are looking for a father figure, or a body guard type.<br>  Or the ones that want you to dominate them in bed.<br>  <br>  Being former military, I'm always a drill sargent.<br>  Whether I'm at work, at home, or in bed.<br>  Some men find that as a turn off because they don't like Alpha females.<br>  And you know what? Too bad, so sad.<br>  Go home to your mommy and let her change your diaper.<br>  <br>  Seriously.......learn to like what you've got.<br>  Now hold that head up and your shoulders back and walk like you are a proud man that has qualities up the yin yang.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  Then go put a gun to your head, loser!<br>  If you can't hack it with the women, then go gay!|`|8o7s9tynaa	You'll never be able to get away from the fact that it's your appearance that initially makes you attractive (or unattractive) to people, with the exception of the blind of course. However, true involvement with a person comes from knowing what is behind the facade, a deeper knowledge of what that person is really like. What puts you off about these girls is not that they find you attractive because of your appearance, but that they're not willing to go any deeper with you than your physicality. You realise that you can't have a proper relationship by fulfilling somebody else's sexual fantasies. It's a tough one, but maybe you really should start making those snap judgements now.|`|bWgF0NoTaa	in all honesty, some girls like that look..<br>  <br>  my ex was my total opposite!.. <br>  i am 4'11" and always dated tall "bad boy" guys with dark hair.. my ex is 5'7", started going bald as a teen to the point where he shaved his head too, muscular built, no piercings or tattoos, and very laid back.. i just wasn't physically attracted to him at all when we met, but i got to know his personality and that won me over..<br>  <br>  looks are not everything.. and i know that you don't want to hear this, but until you can realize that and become comfortable with the way you look, then you won't be happy.. girls like a guy who is confident, but not cocky about it..<br>  <br>  don't settle for less than you
AA11967247	This have very little to do with the "girls" and everything to do with you.<br>  and i have read your question, every time you post its basically the same thing. like you said "I dont know how to get over it".<br>  <br>  these women arent just attracted to your looks, but who you are. you dont like who you are, so why would you like anyone else who likes who you are? But you dont want to hear "learn to like yourself", so i guess suck it up and settle.<br>  <br>  or wait, heres a novel idea, learn to be someone that you like.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Just by the hostility in your question, I would say it's your attitude that is keeping good women from being attracted to you, not your looks.<br>  Everything about your physical features sounds fine, but you seem to have a chip on your shoulder and that isn't fun to be around someone with that.<br>  UPDATE: You just proved my answer in your additional details.  What a temper, you sound like a 6 year old spoiled brat with a sense of entitlement.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Fine then...pull yourself up by the boot straps..stop whining..get counseling..and stop judging yourself and maybe some girl you would like will like you. You give off a vibe to people about how you truly feel about yourself, and the wrong type of girls are attracted to that vibe. Try a new vibe.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I see nothing has changed in the last few months with you|`|AA11706291	By now you should of learned to stop giving these girls a chance, if you don't find them attractive then that's it don't bother with them.<br>  <br>  Yeah you could learn to love the way you are, or you could learn to love someone who will love you back and satisfy you in a way you want to be.<br>  <br>  p.s. calm down this is just the internet and any fool who can turn on a computer and type can answer these questions ;)<br>  You can think I'm just spouting rubbish but shockingly enough there is a woman out there who will fulfil this criteria.|`|K6JSNQJQaa	Okay!  I won't tell you those things, however, you know deep down that it's true.  It seems sad that you only think you attract the desperate women that want to be dominated.  I guess there are some of those out there.  Surround yourself with better people or at least in a different atmosphere. <br>  <br>   Happiness does come from within yourself.  You and only you can make yourself happy, no one else on earth can do that for you.  I've also been where you are, not liking what  I see in the mirror.  But hey..it's all I have so I might as well make the most of it.  I don't get another chance, can't have another body because this one is the one God gave me.  All I can suggest is to love yourself and forgive yourself and you will see that your life will get better....I know that for a fact!  Good luck to you! :-)|`|UV27AyIPaa	Don't shave your head. Let the bald spots be there. It'll make you look more mature and sophisticated. Other than that, a 6'3'', broad shouldered dude sounds like someone who would attract lts of women. Maybe its your attitude.|`|HN693GiNaa	I totally agree with veggie... whoa!  You failed to describe yourself beyond your physical appearance... so if you feel this is the only part of yourself that a women cares about when selecting a partner, then there's half the problem.  The people you attract in your life are like a mirror to yourself... they highlight your strengths and weaknesses, which you have already discovered by your statement:  '....they like what you dislike about yourself'.  It sounds as though you're in a great position to start asking yourself the tough questions and making some changes.
3wjOk0Saaa	number 2... hands down|`|1vZ1n0agaa	im a girl but id pick #2 because the first one doesnt have any curves and her ta ta's are kind of weird. and the last one is just old.|`|G3emC90haa	SECOND all the way! :P|`|By1DJAUOaa	i just came to see the answers.|`|G0U2ExOSaa	I GET TO CHOOSE????????<br>  theyre all so awesome|`|XNe0QM8laa	I'm  a girrl && number two has my vote(:|`|tWSYjZMWaa	1. ok but looks like she wearing a diaper<br>  2. getting better<br>  3. ding,ding,ding, we have a winner|`|9tyx5BkPaa	i think the first is the best looking.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Hmmm...this is like choosing between BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus. Well, I could not see kicking anyone in the bunch to the curb. But, I would say 2,1,3...|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Second most definitely, it is the most proportionate and the model is the hottest.|`|9fpJSgsbaa	I like the petite body on the first girl, she doesn't have fake boobs either which is a turn off. I would probably like her more if she had more curves.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i would go for the second one<br>  <br>  but smaller boobs<br>  <br>  the first one is too average<br>  and the third is too  much for me to handle|`|qZTIVDwqaa	2 please|`|cutfMQ4xaa	I ama girl but I think the second girl has the best body|`|7fdeTRhPaa	I'm a girl but I like the second body the best. Haha|`|D2Dama1saa	well i would take the second, even though all of the models are great looking, the second one has that look in the eyes that has mystery behind it. the first one kinda looked to intense, and well the third one kinda looks clueless. second one looks like one you could have a fun, causal time with. and other good stuff|`|MJD81Frnaa	first girl is hot i dont like the outfit<br>  second girl is really hot and pretty hot outfit<br>  third is ugly with very hot outfit<br>  <br>  i would go wit 2 the happy medium|`|9X7YBQl3aa	i am a girl, but i wouldn't chose any of those,|`|B0nTbAkwaa	LOl I'm no guy but I would kill to have the second model's body! The first's waist is kind of the same as her hips & the last's boobs are too huge.|`|zfN71Mh8aa	im not a lesbian but the first one was the best.|`|dd235370a6c4569337cc8a8e1d335770aa	no thanks, i like my girls body but i'll take the surfboard|`|6o8eA7cxaa	2 has the best body by far, but they're all hot|`|fLvzhAX8aa	I would go first or second.|`|kPhDSht2aa	i love women and everything abt them. all of them r gud. but i would go for second one|`|INLQHsl7aa	second<br>  look healthy.|`|ubsCaEQHaa	I would pick the second girl|`|fznvorZjaa	Second, because my girl has that body.  Plus damn.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	ALL of them are nice but 2nd and 3rd are THE BEST.|`|d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa	Me TWO!|`|Zk7uWuoVaa	first body second is hotter though|`|oXRZfAWaaa	second.  nice curves, not too heavy.|`|QsVNllcraa	I would go for the body of my girlfriend, mainly b/c it doesn't matter what they look like as long as they are semi decent and clean, and you should know what I mean by that. It's more so the feeling that you get when you look into their eyes and actually see them for who they are. But for the polls sake I would probably go with the first one...|`|2tJMvRV2aa	the second one hands down!|`|tSxSjwbpaa	the second she got nice abs and big boobs and is pretty|`|kHe0Cp5Uaa	i have to say num. two, out of the three the pic. of the front was a better shot more revelling showed her beauty. the 3rd. shot was a side shot a little far away, 1 shot was alright but a little less attractive.|`|a8bauuW9aa	first one. breasts are actually REAL|`|tBZNoqwiaa	Number 2 but number 3 is also nice, she looks like something straigh out of the 90s tho|`|2WbR3IvFaa	I like the first one, I love burnettes. She looks a little exotic. Other to are your typical bimbos.|`|l0MCriITaa	second. i like blondes<br>  <br>  then the first. she has a tight body.<br>  <br>  then third. she is thick.|`|DgvDXlV0aa	I think #1 cuz #3 is just a creep and i cant see #2 ????|`|3QNPMVd5aa	the third one is not pretty, in my opinnion, not lez but the 2nd one!!|`|LprlcRnEaa	i would  go for number 2, she has a proportional figure and not huge! like number 3 lol
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Casually ask him if he's ever smoked weed and see what his response is. If he's tried it before or isn't against it, then ask him if he wants to smoke some. But watch out, weed makes you horny, lol.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Good for him not smoking that crap.|`|zxaqL885aa	Tell him. It might be hard to and he might get angry but if you guys are as close as you say, he's going to get over it and he will help you. I mean, whats done is done and you have to accept it and deal with it. He will help you, don't worry.<br>  Good luck!|`|3AXHItOqaa	Tell him. He may get angry, but he's there to offer you guidance. Seems like you can trust him, so go ahead and confide in him. Don't break the trust you have built up. :)|`|AA11099426	WHY WOULD YOU SMOKE WEED IN THE FIRST PLACE DO YOU KNOW HOW LIFE THREATENING IT IS!!!! well anyways, sorry bout that, but i dont know ...
M1jlvLMwaa	friends...yes<br>  associate....no<br>  <br>  too many friends....and you'll feel the effect....too many opinions and too much secret sharing can leave you in a bad situation....<br>  <br>  but associates, you know...scene buddies....at work scene, class scene, social club scene, church scene........these are the people you see and the scene you go to in your life....and that's where they stay at<br>  <br>  friends, ture friends are good..and hard to come by...keep a small circle.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	I say no! lol, I saw someone on Facebook who had over 1,000 friends! How does someone know that many people?|`|Tq8rwL5laa	no, all friends are good. Just make sure to have a couple really good ones. See my blog, <a href="http://becoming-popular.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://becoming-popular.blogspot.com/</a>|`|jO7FtMreaa	Yeah, you at least will feel like you have "too many" friends if your not especially close to one friend but more to group of friends. But you defenitly know you have too many friends when you have to chose between going to 3 different friends' birthday partys on the same day. haha|`|9Rr7Kp6Daa	not really but some times one group of friends will not like the other group and would not like you that much.|`|4c7BBqPFaa	no
Nh2xYpiWaa	That guy could actually like her. I've seen these types of situations at school all the time.<br>  <br>  You know how in kindergarten you used to have a crush on someone but you acted like you hated them, same with the guys they do that as well. Neither girls or guys grow out of it.<br>  <br>  But then again there really is a possibility that he might just not be into her.<br>  <br>  What he said was really rude though, & he does owe her an apology.<br>  If what the guy said was true, then well your friend doesn't even deserve that scum. Why would she like a guy like that?<br>  <br>  Like I said before though he could like her. He probably was disappointed when he heard that from your friend that she didn't like him.<br>  <br>  I hope your friend feels better!<br>  <br>  :)|`|1Czh9SGLaa	wow that really sucks. shell prob get over him. i mean, if they DID go out its not like they were ganna get married or anything. and i guess that sounds sort of mean, but thats wut helps me get through the fact that the guy i like has a girlfriend. he MAY like her, but theres no way to no 4 sure if he doesnt want peeps to no, so just tell ur friend to act normal around him like nottin ever happend and if he sends more signals then, eventually, she can go 4 it. wuts the worst thing he can say? no. then, if he says no, she can go bac to the whole get over him thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps! ;.]|`|HxdqZojpaa	uh.....what sings show that the guy liked her?<br>  He's mean for calling her ugly! >:[<br>  Even if she was joking, he should say sorry.<br>  Tell her there are more fishes in the sea and guys like them are idiots.<br>  People like her are beautiful inside.<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|`|twVyisGnaa	Wow.  That's a pretty tight spot.  Well, maybe he really does like her, but he was too shy to admit it in front of people.  If he's shown signs of interest towards her, then yeah, he likes her.  I wish your friend the best of luck.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!
ICeSfYSzaa	Firstly, begging makes you look pathetic from an older perspective.<br>  After you get through that, try this. Do this now, so she's got more time to think about it:<br>  <br>  "Mom, I promise to stop begging about going ice skating, if you actually promise to think about it. I know you say things might happen, but there's also a chance they won't, and I don't think it's fair that you won't see that chance either. My friends have a parent attending, and i'll call on their phone every so often, permitting you think about letting me go."<br>  That might get your point across.|`|ahujYDBdaa	uh|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you can stay home.|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	be forward with her tell her mom im a big girl now and i can take care of myself tell her i need to go out some time <br>  or you can tell her your friends mom is going to watch you
yNYZdlwkaa	It is always important to help others when you can.  When you think about it wouldn't you want someone to do that for you or someone you love if they couldn't help themselves. <br>  <br>  being made a millionaire, and being given the opportunity to help someone who truly needs it by NEEDING surgery you should take the opportunity.  You will be directly impacting their lives, you will be responsible for the better life that they live and for letting them be around for not only you but for the rest of your guys family as well.<br>  <br>  On the strictly monetary side, as in the $$$ since you are helping them with medical bills you can even actually claim that on insurance as a write off.  Which will help get you a tax break.<br>  <br>  So if you really have the opportunity to help someone do it.  I was fortunate enough to have insurance that helped with my life altering surgery.  I still am making payments on some of it but due to the insurance at least I was able to get it. Some people though just aren't that lucky.  Just imagine, this family member you are helping will have a better life, a better outcome, and better future, and it will all be because of YOU and YOUR generosity.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck with your decision, and I just hope that you will be able to help others.  And that you are rewarded for your generosity! :)|`|MYO2k9EUaa	If I was a millionaire I wouldn't even speak to my relatives anymore. I'd fly off to Japan or somewhere they couldn't ask for my money. <br>  <br>  Plus, being a millionaire isn't all that rich nowadays. It's the billionaires, see?
PXrqqdWlaa	Hi Awesome,<br>  <br>  It's hard to give a direct answer to your question. What sort of stupid comments does he make? Is it about your looks, appearance or what you are wearing? Does he make them when is alone with you or in front of others? The reasons behind this may be that he fancies you and too shy to talk directly or he may have a low self esteem and he tries to compensate by making snide comments about you and try to get a reaction out of you. There's couple of ways you can handle this. One is ask him directly what he wants with you another is every time he insults you, counter by giving him a complement. If he sees that you are not affected by his comments, then he will give up and find another victim. <br>  Remember what he says are just words unless you take them seriously, and make them your feelings. Only you can make yourself feel bad. If you know that the comments he is making is stupid they are really meaningless then isn't it? It may just his warped sense of humor.<br>  Now what's this thing about ugly?? How do you judge beauty? Normally you are your worst critic. Remember beauty is more just in looks. Looks only last for so long and what you are left with in the end is your inner beauty. You must have a lot of it as you care enough to be concerned about his feelings, even if he makes you feel bad.<br>  My guess is that you are in your teens and at school. It's great that you are going to public speaking classes. It will make you more confident and boost your self esteem. Did you know that the second greatest fare that the average American has is public speaking (3rd greatest is the fear of death). <br>  Remember it is case of mind over matter...never mind so it does not matter. <br>  Take care and have an AWESOME day.
2MZZ7Wtwaa	Omgoodness,  I feel so sad for you and I can not think of a joke to tell you.  It is late here where I am and my mind is on me having to sleep alone tonight and frankly...I am a little afraid of the dark.  Silly, right?

You shouldn't try to compare it.|`|RzdQmrV1aa	There's different kinds of love, you know? The love you have for your brother isn't the same love you have for your girlfriend.

u0udwkZQaa	Can't you be musical and athletic? :)<br>  <br>  We like you to be talented, because it makes you more interesting, but a girl that is good with music is the best. You cannot beat a girl with a good singing voice. All that emotion, a great soft voice, is really about as sensual as it gets. The only way to top that is to sing and be a great dancer. If you can sing and move sensually.... HELLO!  Girls can't talk about or act in ways that are directly "provocative" very often without getting some kind of negative reaction/judgement, but by singing (and /or dancing) you can show a sensuality through a talent.<br>  <br>  Athletic girls are always going to get attention, we are initially attracted by what we see, but a singer can always improve her figure, a sporty girl cannot always just learn to sing well.|`|G3emC90haa	YES.|`|G0U2ExOSaa	will she sing when she orgasms?|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Yes I do like girls that sing and play guitar, that is because I do that myself so we can share a passion.

Musical girls are ******* radd!
akwVAZcEaa	It depends on where she hits him and what she hits him with.<br>  Even a man is entitled to defend himself!<br>  <br>  If he hits back with greater force, then it is abuse (of power).<br>  If he hits back so that she is fallen or injured, it is violence.<br>  <br>  However, if it's simply the result of a disagreement and the 'hit' is a slap, it is only retribution because both parties are wrong.  By the same token, it's a piss-weak man that strikes back after a woman's slap.|`|tJRQMkFqaa	IT WOULD ALL DEPEND ON HOW HARD|`|fMEypXDYaa	It's both, neither should be hitting each other at all.|`|d36OrpbDaa	Yeah for both parties. If someone or both were injured or distressed by it then yes.

The other day I came home and found a jockey under our bed.”
mJKSybiVaa	I don't know how u look, but if you can start working out (gym, not very muscular), get in shape of something, then I guarantee that you will get a good looking girl. I see many guys or even girls, who aren't pretty, but they dress up nice and most of them have nice bodies. (why the way I don't check out guys). I hope that would help you and don't let yourself down. there is no such thing as "ugly"|`|igkbUflbaa	Rocks are very compfortable. I've built mine into a martini making machine.|`|SRnPaHBoaa	looks are not everything <br>  i have a crush on this guy that is really ugly <br>  but i like him because of how he treats me <br>  and he is really nice to everyone|`|8816fe6eb0864760b3fcfaf44e012d7faa	Get your self a mighty fine rock.<br>  <br>  Looks mean everything, while personality means less than sh*t. Why do you think women like being with jerks who treat them like dirt?  They would rather be with someone with looks, despite the fact they may be constantly abused emotionally/physically.<br>  <br>  If you are ugly (not as ugly as me, though) than accept and embrace the fact that you will be single your whole life. I have, and I feel GREAT! Let the idiots be punching bags for lowlifes. You just get yourself some good porn, roll up your sleeves, and enjoy FREEDOM!|`|PLtU5AuYaa	get rich.<br>  <br>  that is a guaranteed chick magnet.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	If you are neat and have a neat personality, a woman can forget whether you are handsome or not.|`|G3emC90haa	you could always consider men as another option?|`|MGp3asPTaa	aww i'm sure there are SOME GIRLS OUT THERE looking for a guy who's not the cutest but has a good personality. don't crawl under a rock, opportunities are out there. looks matter, but if the girl is so into you she won't care and will still love you. or get rich xD LMFAO jk|`|pHEIxQoBaa	yeah, looks are important.<br>  but honestly, a kick as* personality is WAY more important to some girls.<br>  <br>  why are these girls out of your league? because they're really attractive? or because their personality is amazing?|`|tSxSjwbpaa	those who say looks don't matter are wrong try surgery, and get rich that is a biGGGG magnet for pretty chics|`|ZQZf1iINaa	dont be a jerk. be yourself. i doubt your ugly. go for the girls that you have things in common with.|`|lLgOxpS5aa	Not all hot girls like men based on their appearance. Some like them because of personality.|`|93IZFDCNaa	I'm sorry but looks are important in the real world. I wish I could say they weren't but then I'd be lying,, But love is on it's way. (:|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Kid, stop being shallow and try falling in love with someone not "way out of your league"|`|IEZoHcysaa	If she is worth having-looks won't matter. Don't be so hard on yourself.|`|iQJ007Bjaa	First off, the these girls who are "wayyyyyyyyy" out of you're league, you probably wouldn't like them that much if you actually got to know them.<br>  <br>  Don't be so shallow.<br>  Looks aren't everything.<br>  I've seen plenty of short, ugly, frumpy men, with gorgeous women by they're sides.<br>  How do they get these women you ask?<br>  I have no clue, but, I'm sure it has something to do with confidence.<br>  <br>  No one will find you attractive, unless you find yourself attractive....besides, think of what horribly pale skin you'd have from living under a rock!<br>  Life doesn't have to revolve around the fact you aren't part of a couple.<br>  Enjoy life while you still can...it's so much easier to find love that way, anyway.|`|LEmnWstMaa	there are girls out there who feel the same way as you.<br>  and do remember that you feel the way you do because the girls you like are as focused on looks as you are. <br>  if you stop focusing on how the girl looks and fall in love with her personality, then you will find a girl that doesn't care how YOU look and falls in love with your personality.<br>  obviously you should find her attractive, but give the girl a chance even if you don't find her attractive right off the bat. your attraction may grow for her.<br>  i actually thought my boyfriend had the weirdest teeth when i met him, and i noticed them for a while, but i've been dating him for over a year and now i love them and think he has the cutest smile ever. i really stopped noticing them once i got to know him.|`|8wb6YhyKaa	look you i bet there's loads of girls who would think your gorgeous<br>  <br>  some times when your a plain rice ball its hard to see the sweet plum neatly embedded in your back this is what will draw someone special when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  further more some guys just need to find that image or something that defines and shows there attractive pull <br>  <br>  and certain girls like different things e.g. glasses=hot long hair smexy (for me any hoo =)|`|1gS6osqoaa	1. Looks are an opinion, so I;m sure that som1 doesn't think you are ugly.<br>  2. they are what gets the girl interested, but if you get to know her as a friend and be sweet, she could fall for you|`|0ie34H7jaa	okay first of all your probably not that bad. people get better looking when they get older lol. <br>  it depends on the type of girl, looks can be deceiving, but its how you act, your personality that really counts =)<br>  hope that helped, and no don't hide under a rock for the rest of your life lol.|`|4LSt76mgaa	Well you shouldn't hide. Ugly is an opinion, and looks are only a fraction of what would be considered attractive. I don't think I'm attractive but I don't let that get me down. I like to think that girls notice our personalities (I know that sounds a little corny) more that our looks.|`|JiBAc9xmaa	you probably just thinkk that your ugly.. and im sorry but yeah..most girls usually fall for a guys lookss firstt... not all of them though, theres also a lot of girls that fall for their personalityy.. which is how its supposedd to bee.. cause looks shouldnt countt. But youll findd someonee, dont go hiding... love comes unexpectedd.|`|wP5QPfpSaa	awwwwwwwwww!<br>  don't crawl under a rock<br>  looks ain't every thing<br>  the same good looking people may look like dogs in the next 2 years<br>  plus personality goes a long way if you meet the right kind of person<br>  <br>  (you could be gorgeous in someone  else's eyes)|`|d5C5FWqwaa	growing up usually makes you more attractice :) and maybe your more attractive than you think...keep your hopes high!! and rocks hurt....|`|15EpL5kJaa	Looks are important to get the girl, but personality is what keeps her there.|`|yFZi78opaa	yea girls are retarded but give it time start just being friends with the girl then move in for the kill|`|lwPbfbMEaa	here's a perfect example.... have you ever seen christina agulera's husband? my god how did he get her?
uVv8lsgxaa	Never have because I watched my mom get cheated on growing up and seen all the hurt it causes and it is not fair to anyone...it is a very cowardly and selfcentered thing to do. Everyone that does that needs to grow a set of b@@ls and break up... the person who you are cheating on deserves BETTER!|`|aeLyiRczaa	No, I wont.  But notice I did not say I would never do so.  Why?  Well, because I have lived long enough to know that for the most part, you place anyone in the right circumstances, under enough pressure and with a bit of hopelessness or frustration on top of that and there is little they will not consider and do.<br>  <br>  When younger, how many things did you swear up and down you would not do, which you have done?  How many things did you swear you would do, which you know you have not done?  You are no different then others.  Everyone has those things in their life.<br>  <br>  Look, all I can tell you is the same thing I seem to end up saying a lot.  That is you need to be honest with yourself about yourself.  You need to be honest about things with yourself to include who and what and how another person really is.  You have to face how you act and what you do.  <br>  <br>  Much, not all but much of cheating is sadly brought about because the partner feels they have little left to loose because their partner will not act as they should toward them.  Yes, both of the people in the marriage probably have legitimate points of contention and good reason to be mad at one another.  But few ever want to see or admit their own wrongs.<br>  <br>  Keep these things in mind and realize that just as you can say a person earned some of what they got from you, you also can be said to have earned some of what you got from them as well.|`|cDC1FHTDaa	First of all.. I think a person needs to ask why are they cheating. Trust me there is NEVER a good reason, but buy asking yourself that question it may let you know if you are ready for a real relationship. I have been married for just over 20 years and yes I did cheat about 16 years ago. I can not tell you why because I don't know why. I just I thought that the "grass was greener" and I was missing out on something. But my wife did find out and "everyone" told her to leave me. Trust me I was one of the people that thought she should leave me. Everyone said " once a cheater always a cheater" But I don't know why, but she took me back. Then about 1 year later I had back surgery, the doctors did not think I would every walk. I was so scare she would now leave me. Guess what?? She did not. She said when we got married it was for better or worce and sickness and in heath." I have never felt so ashame of myself and so prode of her at the same time. I have never cheated again and we are very much in love still. I am glad she gave me another chance. But I would like to say to all the people that are thinking of cheating.. Yes the grass does look greener, But you just water and take care of your "own" grass it will be just as green. Just because some has cheated in the past does not mean he or she will cheat again. But if you are with someone that is cheating all the time. Kiss the S.O.B.  out..|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I have. I was young and stupid and I regret it. Now I'm older and wiser and I hate cheaters like nothing else in life. My ex-husband cheated on me in a terrible way and I truly wonder sometimes if it isn't payback for all the mistakes I made when I was younger.|`|ixRkfLjIaa	If it wasn't for side action, I wouldn't still be married.<br>  <br>  Next year, I won't be.  Happy Days!!!!|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Don't do it. No need to.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	ZERO TOLERANCE|`|s5N28gsDaa	love it|`|4ykgt6rBaa	I have not because my husband is really good to me and I don't feel I need anything else in my life.  People do cheat when they feel that something is missing or if they are feeling insecure.  I am good I don't feel either of those things after 14 years and we are still deeply in love I don't want to risk losing that.  I can't say that it's good or bad really it depends on the situation, but me personally I feel that if you have to resort to that then maybe you should just move on. Think about, is it really worth it?|`|8jnATlpaaa	No and Never, I love my boyfriend more than anything and he loves me too and we do count on getting married.. Cheating just breaks peoples heart...its dumb.. If your cruel enough to do it than.. its your own problem because one day u will get in real **** and youll deserve it all. ( im not saying you did lol i dont know but yea im just saying.) Its just horrible, you love someone stick with them if you love them it means you dont need anybody else :) otherwise you dont really love them.|`|DDUi6NyOaa	NO!!!!  I have been the one cheated on, it hurts! I would never ever do that to someone I love.  It ruins relationships, families, and friendships. Cheaters are the most selfish people on the planet!  It is just plain wrong!|`|mFEevGRXaa	never have and never will. i think it is totally wrong|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	having experienced what it does to people emotionally,no i wouldn't cheat on my spouse. i feel its wrong, and with divorce so easy to get there is no reason why someone should cheat on a spouse before getting a divorce.|`|HynN4MM1aa	Well, if I'm holding 4 aces, and someone else has 5, there's going to be trouble!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I have never and I don't see myself doing it. If I was unhappy and had to look for a new man I would get rid of the one that I had. There is some reason if you are going to cheat. Might as well be happy all the time and not just when you can get away.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	If your married, You should have never married if your going to cheat. If your in a relationship, You'll learn quickly that cheating is pointless and if you want to do it, Then be single! =]|`|AA11618843	That is a No-No. Haven't and wouldn't. I love having friends of the opposite sex, but cheating is out of the question.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	i'd divorce her! i do it about twice a year
kxmxJXEGaa	Why would you want to?<br>  <br>  If you don't love someone enough to be loyal to them then why not just leave?<br>  <br>  Cheating is for losers.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Cheating is the worst thng someone can do to his/her partner, there should be rules and regulations on someone does it, i have never cheated and my husband as well, we r living a very good life full of trust.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	I think its wrong. If you commit to someone than commit to them. If you want to cheat why not break up with them? I dont condone it ever. I wouldnt cheat Im married.
tFKQYT6Naa	okk i hav been in ur shoes way too many times lol.... well me nd my bestie used to fight all the time becuz we were always around eachother 24/7 and wen ur wit someone all the time u kind of get annoyed of them really fast.... and also if ur friend is constantly saying these things to you, you need to hav a serious talk with her becuz if she doesnt really have a reason for it then y is she doing it?? does it make her feel good that maybe shes bringing you down?? and maybe she keeps doing it becuz maybe you dont do anything bout it?? these might be some questions you want to ask her.. hope i helped !<br>  good luck|`|jfiF9XIUaa	She might being telling the truth but iif she is the only one saying it then i would question her friendship towards you because those are wicked harsh things to say to a friend.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Drop kick her into next week. Find someone new to hang around with.|`|yFh9G4FIaa	let the chick know that your none of those an she needs to stop sayin that crap Caz all shes doing is saying things that aren't true an if she was a real bestie she wouldnt be saying that to u|`|u9IMNd7Iaa	It's time to say TTYN (Talk to you NEVER) to your BFF :)<br>  <br>  Like she shouldn't be saying all these mean, horrible things about you. She is supossed to be there for you, and tell you all about your good qualities. Instead she's making you angry and feel bad about yourself.<br>  That's not a BFF. That's not even a friend.<br>  <br>  Don't let her get to you. She's the one who sounds like a real *********.|`|EUnx6Ncoaa	maybe she shouldn't be your bestie if she's acting like a huge beeyotch.|`|zHJufZTcaa	I think I would be looking for a new bff|`|oqcjAMJQaa	i agree with pretty... if she is treating u like this... than she shouldnt be ur bestie|`|ILICVpwHaa	The best thing you can do to avoid MORE drama is just not say anything.  If you aren't planning on ending your friendship then the best way to handle it is to walk away, hang up the phone, or whatever just ignore her comments.  I personally wouldn't call my best friend any of those things whether I was angry at her or not so I don't know if that really makes her a "best" friend but that's your own choice.  If you want to stay friends with her then just let it go but eventually it'll probably hit a point when you can't stand it and your friendship will be over.  Of course you could confront her when she's not angry and tell her how upsetting it is for her to say such things to you and ask her if she could handle it in a more mature way next time she's angry but chances are she will just get defensive and blow up at you anyway.|`|PA7TOIGiaa	Always ask why. If she doesn't have a reason for you being a liar, or so on, than she has no point. If it gets that bad I suggest leaving her with her anger. You shouldn't stick with someone who makes you feel like crap. Unless of course you are guilty towards the things she says, then it's a completely different story. But from the sounds of it you aren't, so it might be time to give your friend a reality check and ignore her for a while, show her that it doesn't bother you. Seriously, I've been there, always remember that things will get better. Good luck, stay strong.|`|AA10834046	Time for a new best friend.  If she is really your best friend, is there any truth to what she is calling you?|`|Ex7hYU0laa	I totally feel the same way with my.... BLAH!!! With that... "friend" they always accuse me and doubt meover stupid crap!!!!! I HATE THEM!!! I feellike doing gthe same thing to them too. So all I do is stop being friends with them and ignore them and not talk to them and stuff and when I do that thats when they want to "care about me: their the ones who are BEEYOTCHES!!! and u shud totally stop being her bff and tell her why when she ask or crap dont even just leave
F7JXjRAuaa	Wow...um if she's serious then there is a problem. You should really talk to her. Being seen as a "****" or "whore" is nothing to b proud of. She probably is seeking attention. def talk to her, being a stripper is not the way to go. maybe, she is afraid because she is unprepared for the future and doesnt know wat she wants to do in life yet. So, she says she wants to be a stripper since its like an easy path to follow. You should encourage her otherwise and assure her that she can do so much more with her life. <br>  good luck! i hope i helped..
08q4OGkGaa	if were talkin bout physical appeaence in a girl the most important thing 2 me is if she has a pretty face, thats the first thing you notice really, her body (aslong as shes not too fat) is always a factor but 2 me it wont really change my mind bout datin her or not, but if u got realy nice eyes and long hair thats always a huge plus and of course acne free or atleast realy low on the acne, but clothes make a huge diference aswell u dont want a girl that dresses like a pig, bright colors like white or light green make a girl look a lot cuter sometimes or dark colors like black and navy blue make u look hotter but if u go to the hot pink color it works sometimes but sometimes it just makes u look like a preppy *****, depends wat it is really and if u have a really nice skin color like a tan that helps soo much cuz personally i dont like pale chicks 2 much.<br>  <br>  but i hope that helps =)|`|G0U2ExOSaa	everything|`|tY4hOjqdaa	a whole lot about girls...where do u start? u seem to be focusing on the physical so I'll address that.

dFHsAXDMaa	As a women, a wife and a mother of 4 kids two girls ages 17 and 15 and two boys 14 and 11.... I have to tell you what you are feeling is so normal all relationships come to the point of being settled and comfortable this does not mean you do not love him. I have been with my husband a long time and we love each other very much but life can often be routine with work, kids, life etc.  we often disagree on things but I am a home care nurse for terminally ill patients and I have the pleasure of meeting an amazing elderly couple who had been married 62 years the husband have kidney cancer and I cared for him everyday for a year I asked them one day when I was feeling very much like you feel now what the secret to a 62 year marriage is and they simple stated as they held hands, " realizing it is okay to disagree sometimes, never going to bed angry, and always remember to say I love you, do not ever take for granted they know and remember you love them take time to say it." it amazed me that their answer was so simple and easy. I have to say it changed the way I looked at my relationship a lot. <br>  <br>  You were definitely need to realize that those butterflies usually fade after a few months as you become comfortable but can be rekindle of special occasions, doing something as simple as slipping a note in his pocket so when he is off to work or somewhere away from you he finds it and smile. he will eventually follow suit. and it will make you feel wonderful and love and cared about. Also maybe try cutting back on phone calls people tend to over kill with calling at the beginning of a relationship and it just ends up happening over and over till it gets old. most important maintain female friends and interest that are simply your time away as he should hang out with the boys as well if you create a relationship where you are each others entire life you will eventually loose you and be miserable. <br>  <br>  for example I coach cheering and softball because I love it. my husband works with the kids at our church in a program that is the equivilent to boy scouts called royal rangers. I take crafts classes and love to sew he rides dirt bikes and snow mobiles with the boys. So when we end the day we have have things to talk about, life remains interesting and we can spend quality time together enjoying the time we have together as a couple.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Partner? How long have you been together? What do you define as in love exactly? If you expect the butterflies to last forever, you bought a bill of goods. The other things you talk about is what real love is about.|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	The passion and lust subside eventually...as long as you have a deep friendship, you're set.  When you're old, what's left?  Conversation..|`|Pj81dRTAaa	If you talk everyday and sometimes several times a day, obviously you'd run out of things to say. You need to have your separate lives as well, your own hobbies, your own friends etc. You seem to have spent too much time together. So take some time apart now and then.<br>  <br>  That being said, its normal that after some time, the butterflies are no longer there, you start questioning whether things would work out and so on. If you aren't physically attracted to him, then well, that's a different story.|`|8jnATlpaaa	Y do people always care about those dumb "butterflies" ?? i really dont get it loll :P anyway everybody is different so of course you will not always get along. ( also fights are usually healthy for couples so dont worry tooooo much) and so when you dont agree its simple simply accept the others choice and stop talking about it or come to a point where theres that little thing in the subject where you agree on and only focus on it !  and how do you run out of things to say? i mean even if its boring i always have something to say.. loll but if you really feel like it wont work.. then stop .. because the longer you stay the harder it will be. but believe me you get over the fights i mean 2  years we fought like a thousand times!!! but we love each other.. so yea..  anyway i hope i helped a little but yea in other words if you feel like it keep trying if you really dont then dont.. xxx good luck...|`|UUrqECXIaa	It depends on what you really want out of the relationship, Are you going to be satisfied for the rest of your life with someone that you are not "in" love with? Some people are, for different reasons.<br>  <br>  It does sound like you have some fundamental differences. I think you already know where this relationship is headed.<br>  <br>  I once dated "the perfect man" or as perfect as they come, Lol. He was all of the things that you would think a woman would want, but for some reason I was not in love with him (I thought I was at one time). The relationship grew stagnant. I ended up breaking it off with him. I always felt a little guilty because I felt like I didn't have a "good" reason to break up with him. No-one ever treated me better than he did. The decision felt right to me even though I couldn't really explain why. It was the right decision because in time I met and married the man that I am in love with.
wjPcDlK7aa	Don't pressure her into it. If she decides she doesn't want to, then say that it's fine. You don't want to ruin a friendship that has lasted since you were both 5. It's cute (:<br>  <br>  However, make the first move if you're pretty confident that she will say yes to the whole 'skinny dipping' thing. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|j7Z1WWXDaa	erm... you can't pressure her to doing something like that! only if she feels comfortable<br>  <br>  and you don't want to ruin your friendship with her

GeruGGOQaa	Not cold just very very set in their ways.  I think it's difficult for a man or a woman to adjust to being with someone all the time once they've become very comfortable being independent.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Nothing wrong with being single and childfree at any age...and it don't mean they are "cold." Lots of people don't marry or have children.  Also a lot of people wait until their 40s to marry and have kids. I've known of a number of women who married late in life and had kids right off either by birth or adoption.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the idea of the single childfree woman over 40 being cold is just a negative stereotype. Better to stay single than marry the wrong person, have kids and live to regret it. Lots of women do that. Some men and women are cold hearted despite having spouses and kids.  As for the part about being gay, I once worked with a very nice woman who was a lesbian. She didn't come out of the closet until after her husband had died and her children were grown.  So ya never know what a person might really be like.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	I'm 33 and I wouldn't judge you to be cold.  Some people just have different wants and desires out of life than to marry and have children.  Some love the single life and travel.  I think it's commendable that you didn't dall prey to the first man that pledged his undying love.  You seem to be very intelligent.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Why waste energy wondering about how others percieve you? It sounds like you've really got it together. And I say you're smart for not getting into a marriage that didn't work and becoming another statistic. it's 2009, not every woman wants to get married and have kids at the age of 21! In fact, it seems like lots of women are waiting until they're older. <br>  <br>  I say just enjoy your life as it comes to you and if others ever say you're cold, just roll your eyes and go "Well then aren't you glad you aren't married to me?"|`|KILFoc6kaa	Everyday with this question.<br>  <br>  Why do you care what everyone else thinks, if you are happy then be happy.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Your  still gay and have a lot of cats|`|asxqampCaa	You must feel vastly insecure to keep asking this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.<br>  <br>  I mean, really. <br>  <br>  <br>  We've all told you 10,000 times - "Don't worry - it's your life - so what what some stupid people think" but YOU CAN'T HEAR US BECAUSE YOU ARE SO INSECURE AND FILLED WITH FEAR.<br>  <br>  Work on *that*.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	When I met my wife she was 33.  That was 14 years ago and we have been married for 12 years.  Personally I think she should have rejected me then, to avoid rejecting me for the whole marriage.  She faked interest to get me hooked... but honestly I don't think she's cut out for it.<br>  <br>  I think a divorced woman at 40 is perhaps an interesting potential mate.  A fully single woman at 40 I would probably avoid... because if you went that far to protect yourself you probably aren't going to be any fun.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	I think smart...hahaha, No, though you may be very smart. I don't see a woman who chose not to get married and have kids as cold or selfish or anything else negative. It was just a choice she made for herself or circumstances didn't work out that way.|`|AA11990465	Cold? No. Afraid to live and love Yes. Loving and even sometimes losing love is all part of life. If you've never loved, you've never lived.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I think most people's first impression of an unmarried, childless, 40 something year old woman is sad, not cold.|`|5hxWSezPaa	You posted the same question last week and my answer is the same.  You will not appear cold if you are warm and outgoing to both adults and children.|`|AA11706291	Seriously now stop posting this question every day, its getting rather annoying.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I don't think they are necessarily cold, but in my own experience, I find that a good portion of single women past a certain age are either desperate, bitter, or both. I realize that it cannot be applied to all or perhaps not most but that's just been my experience.<br>  <br>  I was with you, however, until you said, "many marriages break and don't want that for myself". To me that sounds like you are justifying your singlehood and could be afraid of marriage. People shouldn't get into marriages/relationships because of social stigmas, but justifying it with unfounded assumptions doesn't make you believable. It makes you seem like you're attempting to delude yourself into being comfortable with your choices/situation.|`|ygw1KFWSaa	Sounds a bit lonely to me. Just my opinion. You don't sound cold. You just sound like you are going to end up all alone and lonely. Just because a lot of marriages end doesn't mean  you should not at least try for happiness. Who is to say that it's going to happen to you? Just because you are scared of failure you decide to have a lonely life? Why not risk for love. Love is beautiful, and worth the risk!|`|HL8PEDFLaa	No. I have an aunt who is almost 50 who has never married and has no children and is the most warm, kind person I've ever known. I don't see that as cold, I say do what you want to do. Marriage and family isn't for everyone and it sounds as if your life has been a success. So at least you're not in and out of rehab and living on welfare.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	do you really care what you "seem" like? just wait to find the right guy, i would rather be alone than in bad company... I would suggest online sites like match or eharmony. <br>  so many women write on these "answers" page silly questions that show they are with a guy that is a loser just because they don't want to be without a guy that they will settle for anyone. I admire any woman that stays alone rather than be stupid and hook up with the wrong one.|`|4cbcdee11cb3c61a098a2a21a3d1b3b7aa	NO! you are not cold ....... but you are pretty annoying!<br>  <br>  Why do you keep asking this same #^@&ing Q's?|`|zaIPpr9naa	What are you a Judge or a Lawyer?

You don't want a reputation as one. However, give her the biggest guilt trip possible. If that don't work, you might want to reconsider her as a friend. You might end up with stuff missing, and she'll be the one who is taking them. Two wrongs don't make a right.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	Make her feel bad about it. Remind her about how she felt when hers was stolen and hopefully that will encourage her to do the right thing. If she does not return it then you might want to reconsider your friends because one day she might steal from you.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	report her to the principal.

pDrkcc6taa	Start by telling her that first sentence FACE TO FACE.  If people would communicate more instead of looking for greener pastures there would be ALOT less divorces in the country.  Good Luck|`|H2bpuDsKaa	Is that a picture of your 3 boys? They are absolutely adorable.<br>  <br>  Your ex-wife sounds like a real piece of work. As long as you are paying your child support and taking good care of your kids and they know that you really love them. This is all that matters. I wouldn't try to be her friend, just be civil with her.|`|34b40Vu3aa	What Sandy Ego said, plus, I might enlist the help of a counselor to help with the communication.  Even though you aren't married anymore, it is still important for the kids sake.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Just stay honest... you can't make people set aside their resentment... but maybe she will come around. Point scoring never works... but it's ok to take one for the team.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Maybe you should have thought of that before the divorce.|`|wi6mkT30aa	She may feel that the way you treated her during marriage is going to reflect on the kids. She doesn't want her babies having a father that treats them badly or so she "thinks".<br>  <br>  I think that if you truly want to be her FRIEND you need to have a serious talk with her. Serious, and I mean if you want this to work you have to say what you mean, and mean what you say! As in if you say it, DO IT! Or else this will be  your last chance, no others because at this point she obviously dosen't even trust you. SO this will be hard but I would still try because it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is have a serous talk with her. Ask if you two can meet up somewhere or if not then over the phone which ever is comfortable for her! Express your true feelings on this, don't hide anything back. Let her know that you were wrong all those times before but you want a chance to be friends so the kids can have good rolemodels. Say whats on your midn and heart. Listen to what she has to say too, don't be rude just listen.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything hon!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Haha. Love the avatar.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is - gradually and patiently. If you continue to be a steady presence in your boys' lives, your ex may come around after a while. But if she absolutely refuses to talk to you, there's not much you can do. You will need lots of patience to deal with this.|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	With lots of people its all about the Benjamins, oh well/<br>  <br>  <br>  Try familywizard.com.

8ca486a3b81d2d6b3cb2a798e704148daa	Hey girl. I honeslty felt and kinda still feel this way about this one guy i fell hardest for. We talked for ever and we were bout to date and stuff but out of no where he started being so rude and mean to me. I hated it, like he hurt me because he lead me on and then just threw me away. Idk if i had more feelings towards him then he had for me but what he said and did was mean as hell. But yeah, soon later i find out he has a girlfriend which kills me even more. Its like wheres your soul? How can u possibly move on so quick. But til this day, and its been almost 9 months, i still am not over him. But I did manage to move on and see other guys. Honestly right now, im in an amazing relashionship. Hes beyond what i want. You just have to allow yourself to give in and not allow some guy to hurt you, because you know your better than any guys opinion towards you, and just allow yourself to be a confident lady and let yourself move on. Yes, its possible to find a new guy u will fall for, but then again, that one guy you totally fell hard for will probably be always in your heart. Goodluck hun, hope this helped?:)|`|oPYhUi8baa	I know the feeling, and it hurts like hell. The worst part is that you may be constantly thinking about him but you'll never know if he's thinking about the same way. But the good news is there's always gonna be someone else out there even better. You have to keep telling yourself that and stop thinking ''I can't give up on him''. I know that it's hard but it does get easier.|`|JJMa25NWaa	There is really nothing you can do. To stop thinking about him short term, why don't you go out with some friends and have a good time?

I talked to this guy and he expressed how much he really liked me and everything then after almost 9 months of talking he stopped calling me then i got a phone call saying "i've found someone" i was heart broken but, this is what I did. I sat down and had a talk with God and i asked him to remove all the thoughts from my head about my past bad relationships with guys and to also remove all the guys who were wrong for me out of my life. not only did he heal my heart but all the men who were previously calling and texting me all of them telling me they wanted to be with well girl they all stopped calling me. I even went on one of there facebook pages and it said that he was in a new relationship. I feel so much purer then i was before so. my only advice is to pray to your higher being whomever it may be. GOOD LUCK MAMAS!|`|rAbp4qaXaa	TIME...<br>  I went  threw the same thing..Trust me,you wont stop thinking about him.the best way to slowly get over the pain is to keep your self occupied but not obsessively.I was so depressed during my break up i didn't leave the house for days.If you feel like crying let it out,write your feelings down too.I signed up for community service in my town and I do yoga.By doing that I focused my pain on something positive.<br>  <br>  Do something good for yourself,it will get better.<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck|`|zC7kuMLsaa	i to am in the same current situation, i met a girl a few months ago and something instantly clicked. However she haves a boyfriend already. I played it cool, got as involved with her as possible, by helping her out, talking on msn about things i knew she was into, taking an interest in what she was into etc as cruel as it sounds, this will put a strain on there relationship as the other partner gets jealous, which can make the person you fancy look to you more as a better person, this seems to be working for me atleast.<br>  <br>  It appears at first she didnt care about me much, but i figured if i act all sad and depressed that wont change, she wont want to carry my weight as well as her own, and so just be yourself, bubbly and happy, you can play dirty tactics depending on your morals, or clean tactics, your a girl, a guy loves a girl who is concerned for him and can challenge him equally, trust me.|`|sGUPNkQdaa	speaking from experience; as much as you may feel you love this person, your situation still wont change unfortunately.

I know it hurts so much now but, really, you are only doing this to yourself.   <br>  <br>  Keep a healthy perspective. Stop dwelling, stop posting this question and distract yourself.

(clothes, laptop...everything) As i was parking i watched the man that i LOVED and who i THOUGHT loved me in return, walk in with another B***H just under a week after we broke up. you can only imagine what that would feel like. that's not really the case in your problem but, this is. I CANT GET OVER HIM. i feel like i lost the best thing that's ever going to come my way but really now I'm starting to think hes missing out. honestly girl, your going to feel that way until something better comes around. if hes not in to you then F*** him.

I'm in a similar situation, I have a ridiculous amount of feelings for this guy and he doesn't notice me too much either. Sadly, you and I haven't found someone else to replace these guys. I don't know about you, but finding someone else seems to be the only way for me to get over someone. It's never been time to heal my wounds, just somebody else healing them for me. I believe you are the same. Some people are different. We think maturely and somehow, it's takes us a much longer time to get over someone rather than bounce back and forth to another guy. I hope you find a guy who cares about you soon. Good luck and best wishes :)...

Physical violence is rarely a valid response, and depending on where you kicked him, you could do permanent damage, or even (unlikely, I'll admit) kill him. <br>  <br>  If you want to do the "right" thing...come forward on your own. Be more adult than most adults in this world, and accept responsibility for your actions and grow. Detention and being required to "publicly" apologize are likely to be the outcome. Unless your school has a zero tolerance policy.<br>  <br>  If you don't come forward and he does, anything you say in your defence will likely be looked at as an attempt to avoid blame...true or not.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|gNw5RDrqaa	cry and say u were being bullied|`|4k7HWQJ4aa	Pssht.

Thank him for being your support and that you're very appreciative. Remind him again that you love your husband and you'll never leave him but you would like to keep him as a friend or brother figure, strictly platonic. But if he continues to talk to you so intimately knowing that that's not what you want you tell him then you're going to have to cut off the friendship and you would hate to do that.|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	Deployed husband...happens all the time.

Emancipation is where you get legally seperated from your parents, and you are considered an adult. You have to prove to a judge you can support yourself (school, job, place to live) and he might grant it to you. Emancipation is dificult though.
FBUEi2Pnaa	hi everyone
HKkbqlIuaa	I swear to you, I got myself into the exact same situation not all that long ago. You really need to be open with her about. I can honestly say, that I was partially miserable when I wasn't honest about my feelings. When I finally did tell him, it felt so much better. At first he said he didn't want to "ruin the friendship." About a month later, we ended up dating, and now we're engaged. Well, good luck. Believe me, despite her reaction, you will feel much better if you're honest with her about it.|`|y4qNVFxYaa	WOW! what ever you do do NOT! tell her<br>  i been in this position when my best guy friend told me<br>  he was "in love with me" and it is very awkward.<br>  after he told me and i rejected him we were still cool <br>  but im not the type of girl that looses friendships with a guy<br>  just cuz i reject them. but is she?? think about that<br>  if you tell her how much you like her then maybe she <br>  isn't gonna want to talk to you anymore and things wont <br>  be the same as it was before. you should think<br>  about it and decide if you do tell her and she rejects you<br>  you probably aren't gonna be as close to her as once you<br>  were with her before but if you don't tell her you can always<br>  be close to her and she will never have to know.<br>  but if you really do like her you should find out first <br>  if she likes you more then a friend :)|`|Q4KfpRdDaa	Its better to tell her to see what happens, because if you don't, you will spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been. ;D Good luck!

rVnTnuU1aa	No, not at all. No matter what problems you and your husband have, you should always protect the kids by not getting them involved in adult stuff. So if you wanted to achieve making your husband look like a complete as$, you certainly did that. In front of his child. If you also wanted to achieve changing your sons image of his father, you did that as well. I guess my question is what did you plan to achieve from all of that? <br>  <br>  My personal opinion is instead of protecting your child from that mess, you put him right in the middle. Your parenting skills suck, and i would never do that to my two children. What the hell were you thinking? Or were you just not thinking?|`|a66nvk0taa	Just because your husband hurt you having an affair, so you decided to tell your 12 year old son about his father. Was this revenge on your part to make you feel better? and that you son would have the same opinion about his father like you? I tell one thing some day your son with throw this up at you when he older. Who be sorry then? You!|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	No, you did the wrong thing.  Your 12 year old son isn't capable of having an adult relationship, so he isn't capable of understanding one either.  Any lesson you were hoping to impart on him is probably lost.<br>  <br>  If you were intending on this being a way to punish your husband, well, then that's even worse.<br>  <br>  Either way, I'd say you screwed up.|`|0AShsMsoaa	sure, your 12 year old is at the perfect age to understand his father is a hopeless jerk and his mother is an idiot.  <br>  <br>  we are parents to nurture and protect our innocent children from harm. you harmed him.  to make it up, you and dad have another talk with him about how wrong you were to bring him into your private troubles at his tender age.  and then you both take him to a happy family evening like to a movie or something. <br>  <br>  you are stupid and selfish and the last thing a mature person does is bring in a 12 year old boy to referee her marriage.  your marriage is never ever ever something you discuss with a young boy like this.  <br>  <br>  grow up. apologize to him, both of you, and both of you act like freaking adults around him. the best thing for all of you is if he and dad develop a hobby or sport together, like golf.  hear me?|`|VSCYTZ38aa	It probably was not the best idea in the world, but your son may have suspected something already. Children can be very intuitive. I knew my dad was having an affair before anyone ever told me. I even asked my mom about it before HE told her. I think it was selfish of you to do it the way you did though.|`|RtkB46peaa	You drug your kid into this because.....  what?  You wanted him to share the burden?  Or were you just using your child as a way to punish your husband for cheating?  Either way, it was a bad move.  What 12 year old could possibly deal with this well.  Just because your husband is irresponsible, doesn't mean you need to be, as well.|`|m81dfyOYaa	What a cruel and thoughtless thing to do to a 12 year old. Marital problems should never be discussed with the children for the exact reason you described. You've succeeded in diminishing your husband to his child.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Too late to hang in there for the kids.  You just put your 12 year old right in the middle of a VERY adult situation.  NEVER intentionally involve a child in husband/wife problems.  And never try to make your spouse look like the "bad guy" to your kids, even if he is.  You're doing it for all the wrong reasons.  What GOOD has come out of you forcing your husband to tell all to your 12 year old?  Absolutely nothing!  The best thing now is for the two of you to divorce.|`|iD4ejChZaa	12 isnt a small child, he already knows about sex and affairs, lets get real here, <br>     a 12 y.o. has a right to know the mom is hurting deeply, he is not 5.<br>   have the dad do things together with his son pay him extra attention, <br>  many many children much younger than he is carry deeper, worse secrets,  you did not ruin him for for life. obviously you raised him to be happy and confident so he will bounce back, get into a good biblical church, for all your sakes.|`|AA10834046	I don't think you did the right thing.  What happens in your marriage is not always appropriate for a 12 year old.  Do you normally discuss your sex life with your 12 year old?<br>  <br>  I think your anger with your husband was  dropped in your son's lap.  For what gain?  Maybe 5 years from now would have been a better time to tell your son what he had done.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	"trying to hang in there for the kids" ..............thats a heap of BS.<br>  <br>  How on earth could you possibly bestowe such a burden of guilt onto a 12 year old.........? You could have possibly ruined his self confidence for life! .........DONT BRING KIDS INTO ADULT CONFLICTS!!!!!!<br>  <br>  so the answer to your question is NO you have NOT done the right thing!!!|`|n8lXItGraa	Don't stay together for the kids.  You resent your husband.  Your son is a shell of himself.  Take him away from the stress.  You're not doing your kids any favors...they know what's happening, don't let them sit in the middle of it.  Time to make some adult choices.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I feel sorry that you had to endure the betrayal of your husband.  However, You have just made your son a collateral damage to your own troubled marriage.<br>  <br>  You, knowingly or unknowingly, only wanted to destroy the image of a good Dad in your son's eyes.  It is a very selfish and self-centered act.<br>  <br>  If you really are trying to hang in there for the kids, you should insulate and shield your kids from all those chaos of the troubled relationship with your husband.  After all, he is your own choice.  You deal with him yourself.  Don't try to bring kids to "your side" by dragging them into the mess.|`|weBvwrloaa	no. your 12 year old did not need to know what went on. That was between you and your husband and unless your son was already aware of something ( like he already knew that his father cheated by chance) nothing should have been said until he was much much older. Hang in there for the kids? That's the worst reason to stay with someone. Trust me- I "stayed for the kids" for 8 years. And now when I look back I wonder what type of damage i might have actually done. Children are not stupid and they pick up on all the little things that you think your hiding. Your son was probably aware that something was amiss between you and your husband but he did not need to know the sordid details. That was wrong of you on so many levels. You have probably screwed up how your child views his father and while what his father did to you and the sanctity of your relationship was beyond wrong, you had no right to screw up  or tarnish your childs relationship with his father if he wasnt aware..be angry at him but so not  drag your children into it to make him feel worse. Not kosher mom.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	I would say that you should not bring your child into your marital problems.  I know that you are angry at your husband, but in the end you just destroyed you child's relationship with his dad.  It is hard enough to be a teenager without adult problems on top of it.  This should have remained between you and your husband.  I think that it was a selfish thing to do.   Family counseling sounds like a good idea for this situation and unfortunately you can't undo what damage has been done.  You should always put your children's best interest first and this time i do not believe that you did that.|`|Pj81dRTAaa	Well, you may have told him too soon, of course he would have to be told sometime. If you plan on working things out though, then you would have to learn to forget (or act like it), and by this your son would also. Hopefully, he'll get back those qualities that you mentioned. It's not impossible and it's very unlikely that he'll be like this forever. All the best...|`|zHJufZTcaa	Naw... You put that poor kid right in the middle of something he does not deserve to be in the middle of. Shame on you!!!  Did you make your husband tell anyone else?? My guess is no because you feel it is none of their business. Same hold true for the kid. That is a situation between you and your husband. What you are trying to do is get the kid on your side against his dad, and for that you should burn in hell|`|LATeq09waa	i dont think that you were right in making your husband sit down and telling your son about his affair.    i understand the hurt you were going through.   to be honest with you, i have been on both sides of the fence when it comes to affairs, so maybe i shouldnt even be voicing my opinion.    i do think tthat your family could use some counseling, though.  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|sPOmz9wUaa	umm wow now u really need to talk to your kid. Personally if my parents had an affair and didnt like living together i would want them to divorce so they would be happy(this is not advice just my opinion) but I would talk to your son see what he wants or thinks. (talk to him ASAP)|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	That's horrible! You shouldn't get your children in the middle of this. You'll never be happy with your husband and the kids will sense that.

Just be quiet..|`|aeLyiRczaa	I think you were probably just being spiteful in a way and also trying to make the kid hate his father as you do right now.  You probably did the typical female thing in trying to use the kid as a pawn to gain the upper hand.  But then again, Dad should have learned to not do things he would be ashamed to tell his Son about too.<br>  <br>  You know, in many cases I do not think kids need to be shielded from things.  In many ways, I think that doing so causes more problems later.  Kids should see and then learn by seeing that actions and choices come with costs and consequences and that at times, it is innocent people who pay the costs as well.  If more kids learned this early on, they may be a lot better people then they turn out to be.<br>  <br>  Now, this is something I always suggest and people usually hate me for it.<br>  <br>  You sit down and be very honest with yourself about yourself and your marriage.  How much if any part did you play in your husbands cheating.  Dont give me that line about no one deserves this.  No kidding.  People usually do not deserve many of the things they get, both bad and good.  But if you are like many today, you did a lot of things that made it very easy and almost justified to cheat on you. i.e.  You did not have sex.  You showed him no respect or appreciation but instead thought he was just suppose to do what you wanted.  Now be honest with yourself and admit if this is the case with you.  If it is, then you need to go to your son and confess your wrongs in the way you have acted toward Dad and in general and explain to your son that at times, the way we treat people will help them feel okay in doing badly.  Explain to him that Mom may have not treated Dad very well either if it is applicable.<br>  <br>  One thing you had better always be prepared to do is follow the same rules and standards that you demand of others. If you will not do so, you are just another sack of poo that thinks they are somehow allowed to dish it out yet should not be made to take it.<br>  <br>  I am not trying to be rude or mean to you personally.  It is just that I have seen a huge number of women think they can act like an *** or show no love to their husband and still think they have a right to cry foul or play the victim role when they receive the natural results of those actions.|`|LCE8iUnWaa	Tough question. The general guidelines is that you should tell your children, when it comes to things like this, only what they want to know. <br>  <br>  If your child seems less than happy these days its more likely secondary to the increased tension at home, especially if you and your husband are arguing. Most likely there is also the fear that you both will get divorced.<br>  <br>  Throughout this stage whether you and your husband decide to continue and heal or call it quits you both have to express your love toward him without over compensating. Therapy for the whole family and for the couple might not be a bad idea.|`|qAR26vRFaa	You can't be serious!  What parent in their right mind would involve a young child in their relationship issues. There is no way a child is emotionally equipped to handle you and your husbands obvious emotional issues.What were you hoping to accomplish by doing this?  Do the kid a favor and get counseling for the whole family.|`|EdBCksSwaa	I am having a hard time understanding why your son needs to know that his father is cheating,bad move lady,keep the kids out of the adult stuff until they are adults themselves,even then is it information they need to know?bad move.|`|SqCyS12daa	are you kidding me?|`|FL0S2tSCaa	Idk I think u might of hurt the young guy

Love isnt about DOING anything TO someone, its a mutual exchange of physical affection for each other, and if you dont know that you are either 10 years old or seriously disturbed. Your question is disturbing and slightly scary actually|`|HynN4MM1aa	I'll do her laundry, but that's about it.
06iz5ttqaa	just sit them down and talk to them about it try to get them to understand that you will be a adult by the time you get married anyway|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Let him finish his 4 years and you get through school first hon.There is too much going on pulling the 2 of you in too many directions at once.It is easier to get all of this out of the way BEFORE marriage than after,Be patient.If you love one another now, you will 4 yrs from now.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	So stop worrying about it if you are going to get married in a couple of years or so.  That's some time, by then they will know you are serious.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Do they like him as a boyfriend? If not, this could be tough.

dJ7xagFCaa	be understanding and be her BEST FRIEND<br>  <br>  until she can. that way when you ask her out, you wont be sneaking <br>  <br>  because thats not how a relationship should be. when you ask her, she will be already close and have a strong bond. just always be there for her and you can still go hang out, out of skool.<br>  also, idk this is ur decision but you prolly shouldnt date other girls while your her BFF and dont lose hope and drift off cause shell feel like you got bored of her and shell be sad!<br>  <br>  just be as close as you can get without being too close.<br>  trust me. im not allowed to date either =/<br>  <br>  but i have close guy friends that i would consider going out with once im allowed to. be one of those guys for her. <br>  <br>  =] hope this helps.|`|0vW88Uw9aa	aww! well just hang out as 'friends' don't tell your parents your dating or any of your friends. keep it a secret it'll be funner haha! or just hang out with each other at you're friends houses tell them the problem and I'm sure they'll understand!!! :)|`|1gS6osqoaa	i agree. Don't ask her to sneak around her parents, because if she doesn't fell comfortable with that then she won't feel comfortable dating yoou, which won't be good.

If not sure whether she wants to or not, ask.
Tq8rwL5laa	I'd back off, guys just don't understand. If you say anything, they'll think your being controlling and get pissed. If he does something really obvious flirty, just mention how you don't like it.

You claim that he don't like her romantically, I assume.  Well this isn't true, he likes her in some odd way!  Before something really happens.  You need to take a stand and or it's over!  I smell a rat!!!!|`|5rAsoQVDaa	Implement more jealousy because it's the foundation of a solid trusting relationship!

LYdHLw7naa	Well Pr!ncess... sounds like you got it all!  Start talking to the others about her copying you all the time. maybe she'll back off.  Then again some girls would love to have that.|`|7wlgFBacaa	Oh gosh. I was in your place a few years ago. Except I had it happen to me with a girl who I didn't really even like that much. As the person above me said, it does mean she admires you. Just try talking to her privatly and tell her that you don't like how she copies you. Thats what I did and it worked. If you have any questions, mail me at pointeperson@yahoo.com  I really will help you if you need it!|`|u9IMNd7Iaa	Take it as a compliment. She's copying you because she wants to be like you, or because she thinks you look good. Though it's not cool that she claims to make up the trends when it was you. But yeah,she just wants to be like you, It's annoying but it's not a super bad thing.|`|M7NFiBBBaa	She admires you. You should be glad but i understand how that is annoying. You should complement her on how great she is and maybe then she will act more like herself and not be a minature you. If that doesn't work you can always start wearing really ugly clothes so she won't copy you.|`|VvCHiOC2aa	My boyfriend puts an s at the end of everything to but he does it on purpose.Just one day when she put an s at the end of the sentence ask her why she does that and ofcourse she will say that she does it because you do it.

1936c4452418e5d1e53f841e56ce4d31aa	oh God. That reminds me of my life back home. I had a step dad that gave me HELL. I never could dress, act or look the way he wanted me too, nothing was ever good enough for him. My mom just sit back and didn't say anything either. Even when she did, he wouldn't hear it, it was his way or no way. The thing is, he has no idea how to be a father, that was the case with my step dad. There is nothing you really can do but sit down and talk to them both. The best thing you guys could do is go to a therapy, b/c there is clearly alot going on in this family that needs to be fixed, if you guy don't work together at this its not going to get better, i can tell you that right now. I ended up moving out when i turned 18. That was when my step dad woke up, it is amazing how different that man is now, its like he isn't the same person. But im not saying that is the case with you. My mom and my step dad still have problems to this day, i swear i don't even see how they make it together really. But all i can tell you Sweety is just to talk to them, not yell, talk to them, tell them how you feel, that your are sad and that you ALL need to work threw alot of things. It has to happen for this to work. Good luck with all of this!|`|miLNyc2Gaa	I have had 4 step dads now and it was not fun. Now I am grown and dont have to worry about being around them... I know what you mean when you say they are disgusting. I can t stand to be around my mom and her new husband... It would be scary if you think your dad will hit you.. Can you get counseling??? I did when I was a teenager for all of the dysfunctional family stuff...  It could help... I feel bad for you.. I was always angry and I still dont have a great relationship with my mom.. We dont talk much.. actually I cant stand her. How old are you???|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Jesus Christ!  I have heard of stories like this and this is very sad for me! My heart goes to children like this!  I have 7b,10b,13g of my own. I am their father!!!   This is why I teach my own children THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY!  Life is not perfect!  You have to make the best of it and be as professional as possible to be able to handle things in this crazy, unperfect world!  My world has been upside down for many years!  So I just make the best of it, even when everything else fails!  I handle things at a professional level, as best as possible. Life in general is so un perfect!  Make the best of what you got and be as happy as possible in this not so perfect world!|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Go to your school counselor they should be able to help you.
aDL7xmt6aa	Discrimination from both sides?|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Not having huge 4 course meals everywhere I go. My fiance is Canadian... I'm Italian and we eat WAY too much sometimes.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Openness and acceptance.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	In truth, most of the benefits are fairly subjective. <br>  <br>  In most of the cross cultural marriages I know of, one person or the other acclimates to the other persons culture (religion, holidays, rituals, traditions, etc).<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if you're not fully prepared to embrace the other person's way of life...you consider the ramifications of your decision. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, marriage means children. And the children often spark a culture clash with regard to their upbringing (people suddenly become their own parents). <br>  <br>  So take that into consideration, before you make any rash (ASAP) decisions.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10197672	Its uniqueness, new attitudes, new traditions, new genes, new morals and behaviors. THese all could be both good and bad and thats for you to find out by dating the guy. Sometimes when you are with a person from a different culture they show you a world that you never thought existed. Its pretty interesting actually...|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	An outlook on the world that is unique and expansive.  It could be a great way to grow as a person - to be open to new ways of looking at life.<br>  <br>  By the way...why ASAP?  Are you literally walking down the aisle now, trying to decide whether to say I do?|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Enlightenment.<br>  <br>  Too many too list. <br>  <br>  Love should be the number one though.|`|HN693GiNaa	Every relationship has it's obstacles, and there can be more when marrying somone of a completely different culture.  However the benefits usually far outweigh this!<br>  Your mind will expand to embrace new foods, ways of thinking, beliefs, language, landscape and will also help you to become a better person.  I was engaged to someone of completely different culture while I was living in Asia and although we didn't end up marrying, I came away with much more understanding, patience, respect, open mindedness and empathy.|`|HRegfSrEaa	uniqueness, different look on life, different set of morals....etc...
2hcA3VP9aa	if your friend who is a girl like the other girl then she might be gay. i think the best way to find out is to just flat out ask her if shes gay. if she asks why just tell her some of the thing's that she has been doing. i hope this helps.
HWiXlkf9aa	He's not a true friend.  Don't count on him to be there for you when you need him.  You can still talk to him - but don't depend on him.  There are different kinds of friends and it's ok to have different kinds.  True friends, friends to have fun with, acquaintances...he is a fair weather friend, only there when he needs you.  Don't go all out for him, stop calling him.  Let him come to you.  If he doesn't, forget about him.  Make new friends.  He'll realize what he lost!|`|fQSO6Ukbaa	u gotta tell him... but tell him calmy and just say it like u talkin like a normal covo. but ur gonna have to tell him b4 its too late|`|gpb74wKmaa	tell him what you're feeling. DOn't yell at him though, he'll only get all defensive and be really hard to deal with. Don't end the friendship, whatever you do. <br>  just talk to him. maybe he doesn't know what he's doing. tell him that whenever he's in a relationship, you feel like a third wheel. Make him understand.<br>  <br>  xoxox hope i helped!!! :)|`|Tq8rwL5laa	mention it to him, but don't count on it working. Make more friends and hang out with them, and when he goes back to you hang out.. but dont leave our old friends behind.

SCXkBWk6aa	hmm. tricky.Tell your cousin that she ought stop doing what she is and behaving the way she does, or else you'll tell her mum. And, if she does it again which she most likely will, say u gave her a warning then discreetly let her mum no, and let her handle it. If she stops - simple! problem solved, then.<br>  <br>  goodluck! <br>  She may get annoyed at u for "dobbing," but it has to be done if she is getting to a stage where yopu think it is out of control!
ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Give him some time.  Guys recooperate after a break up sometimes a lot slower than women (the good ones anyway).<br>  <br>  So take that as a sign - at least he has feelings!!<br>  <br>  Don't rush him and just reassure him that you appreciate him and love him and will always be there for him when he needs you.<br>  <br>  With that, he should come around in time, maybe sooner than you think ;-)
mNZCMuSpaa	I always laugh it off.<br>  Sure, I'm embarassed, but the people around will forget about it within a couple of days..<br>  even though you usually don't forget for quite a while.|`|EQh9GZpXaa	just laugh about it, it helps trust me
ZTivdX4raa	wow, you are NOT over reacting, I think that you should honestly, dump your girlfriend. I'm not saying that as like, to be mean, but that was SO immature (how old are you anyways?!) <br>  <br>  WHEN YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, YOU DO NOT TELL ANOTHER GUY YOU'LL "THINK ABOUT IT!"  <br>  <br>  lessons to be learned.
bO2rzfISaa	Just a thought. Couldn't you go to court and get an order here? Ask an attorney.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	You are lazy. Move on with your life.<br>  <br>  I hate it when people cry the victim. Just because he is a lazy person, doesn't absolve you of your responsibility of providing for those children.<br>  <br>  You are spending more time trying to milk him for every penny that you can instead of doing what? Investing time in education and career so that you can make your own money perhaps?<br>  <br>  $1000? What a joke. L A Z Y!!!
CWgJ7Yyxaa	Tough situation.<br>  As a woman, I totally understand your anger and resentment at your boyfriend's attitude. I would also feel betrayed...and I would wonder if my relationship is as solid as I imagined it was. <br>  <br>  If I see it from your boyfriend's point of view, I can understand he was torn...and he didn't know HOW to handle things! He thought the simplest thing to do was to avoid a scene and drop you off....and he probably feels you should have understood his position and how he felt he was doing the best thing, considering the circumstances. <br>  <br>  My guess is he knows he let you down; he is also worried how this will affect your relationship; and he must be really anxious because he knows his ex will make things even harder for everyone now. <br>  <br>  A part of me actually feels sorry for him....He is in quite a pickle now!!!<br>  <br>  I'd strongly suggest you go to counseling or therapy, so you can vent and deal with your negative emotions. You are entitled to feel the way you do. But since there is so much at stake....don't say or do anything you might regret. Keep your tongue under control.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Too much drama here. I'd take a hike.<br>  There's plenty of guys out there with no baby mama drama!|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Wow, I can't believe this. I read some of your other questions,  and I have to admit it. That's pretty scary. But, I would go see court. That is completely ridiculous. Why wouldn't she let you see the poor little child!? That is so immature. She probably doesn't even love him. She's probably just using him to get you P Oed really. <br>  <br>  Go see court. She NEEDS to get it together. I feel as though she should be arrested, though I know they have no right to do it. Get a restraining order against the MAD WOMAN please. Tjis is really sad hearing that anyone would suffer like this.<br>  <br>  Simular things went on with my parents, though, it was much much worse. So please, take care, and don't get the woman any more mad than she already is, God Bless.|`|WVcUweTEaa	The joys of blended families and ex wives.  Ok, I've been here and still am after 13 years and although it's hard to give in to her demands, sometimes you've got to take a step back and think about how your reaction or decisions is going to effect the child's wellbeing and sometimes your going to have to be a grown up and a better person and make a decision that's not best for you, or her but the child.<br>  <br>  Being at drop off and pick up is not a big deal, nor should you make it out to be.  Go shopping or something while he's picking up his child.  Give he and his child some time alone while they come back to pick you up.<br>  <br>  What comes around goes around yes.  If she's a horrible person, she'll get hers don't you worry.<br>  <br>  That child will grow and reflect on how his mother/father/you treated and acted around and with him.<br>  <br>  Should he give in to all her demands - no....but when it comes to a situation that you've wrote about above, it seems petty how each of you handled the situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck...there are lessons to be learned here.|`|pDrkcc6taa	He needs to stand up to his ex and for you.  She is just a jealous resentful person.  Anyone who would put the child 2nd is ridiculous.  Just remember what comes around goes around.  Talk it through with your husband, and don't let the two of you build resentment over something so foolish....|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Sometimes even though it sux, you need to put the child first. Was it worth watching a 4 year old hysterically crying? That's terrible. Even though she was very wrong, you did not put the kids feeling first.|`|mqd1WmSVaa	I would too if I was you. You should tell him how that made u feel|`|NGKwsawdaa	You and your boyfriend are mad, and the mother is crazy, but what about the little boy.Didn't anyone think about him?  damn it if that's what the stupid mother wanted for me not to be there, I would have been dropped off some else so this little child didn't have to stand there for an hour and suffer. how sad. sometimes we have to be the better person and not try to prove a point all the time exspecially when there is a child involved.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	He seems to have a hard time convincing women to do things. If he cannot get his own girlfriend to comply with a simple request, how could he possibly manage to get his bitter ex to comply with something she dislikes? Which is more important to you: having your way and his child hysterically crying or just letting it go and having peace with him and his child? His ex is clearly in the wrong, but you're not making it any easier on anyone involved.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Oh hell no!<br>  <br>  Your Boyfriends Son is only 4 years old now and he is giving in to ridiculous demands from his Son's Mother!<br>  <br>  Whats next?!?<br>  <br>  Your Boyfriend needs to call her on all of her drama and put a stop to it.<br>  <br>  If he is wanting to cave into her demands no matter how crazy they are now, believe me when I say it will only get worse.<br>  <br>  He needs to stop threatening to have her up on contempt charges for non-compliance of a court order and follow through with it.<br>  <br>  This Woman will not get it until she is slapped up along side the damn head and be forced into doing the right thing for their SON.<br>  <br>  This isn't about acting in the best interest of the Child on her part, it is about being bitter and wanting your Boyfriend to suffer for her unhappiness.|`|wi6mkT30aa	This sounds like a mess, you're not wrong. I think there are times you have to be reasonable but this just isn't right. It's crazy. He doesn't need to be dropping your butt off at a gas Station to make his EX happy. Hell NO! That's wrong. His butt needs a wake up call and i'd break up with him or tell him your mad and not talk with him for a while because tha'ts crazy he needs to learn from his past and know your his future. If not then yu need to dump him now and get away from the drama!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yQfaj7c2aa	Hi-<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you can't change your boyfriends or his ex's behavior -you can only change your own. I don't think you did anything wrong in this situation. The person who is ultimately wrong is the ex. She was the one acting irrationally and hysterical. She obviously has some very hard feelings toward you and still feels very strongly about your boyfriend. I don't imagine it is easy for her to hand over her son to her ex and his girlfriend, but this doesn't excuse her behavior or the trauma she put her son through. I don't think your b/f has a reason to be upset with you and I don't believe you should allow him to make you feel guilty for anything you did. I understand he wants to pick up his son without incident, but he needs to see that his request was unreasonable.<br>  <br>  Hang in there- this will blow over...|`|M1u6fdZCaa	I would be pissed; you need to let him know how you feel.  He should respect you and should place you above any other woman's request.  I know she may feel hurt when she sees you, but come on...you've been with him for a while now and she needs to go ahead and get used to you.|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	I understand he wanted to keep the peace, but all of you where wrong. Anytime a child starts crying the way you state"hysterically" then all adults are dead wrong!  I get the funny feeling your leaving a major part of the story out. Was she the other woman or were you? For her to have this much animosity toward you means something missing out of this story.|`|HlR7egIeaa	I think your boyfriend should grow a pair honestly and I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself and not letting the ex run the show (as they so often like to try and do with thier kids). His ex was being incredibly immature and your b/f should be directing his anger at HER for being a b*tch and not at you!!! He's allowing her to bully. And I'm surprised the mom is acting this way since you and him have been living together for 3 years already. Whats her prob with you being there with the exchange?? I think it might be a good idea though for you not to be around while the exchanging of boy is going on to avoid her craziness, not to cater to her or anything, just to avoid the drama since she is so good at causing it. Because really, regardless of who caused it, the kid is the one who was affected the worst and he's the innocent one in all of this and didnt ask for any of it! <br>  <br>  Sorry and I hope that helps!!! :-(|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	If I were your boyfriend, I would resent you, too.<br>  <br>  Your refusal to sit quietly at a gas station for 10 minutes, caused his 4-year-old son to cry hysterically, the cops had to be involved, and there will most likely have to be a court date to resolve the matter (if the child's mother tries to contest it).<br>  <br>  YOU betrayed HIM by not being understanding of a high-stress situation.  I bet he is furious with you.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I don't think you are crazy.  I do think that the two of you need to sit down and figure out how you will handle these types of situations in the future.  Are you planning on being married?  His son must come first, and you do need to realize that.  Are the other children yours, or his, or both?  It is not easy blending a family and you will need to come to some agreements.  Good luck.|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	It's pretty obvious that he cares for her more than he cares for you...If I were you as of today he'd be referred to as my ex boyfriend.<br>  <br>  So if you guys ever got married are you suppose to kiss her @ss on a regular basis or what?
5DJzp6bMaa	Call the Navy|`|kbz5S3waaa	do you at least know if he was in the Navy? If so he should have his old uniforms / medals. Ask to see his achievements and certificates|`|bO2rzfISaa	When someone lies over and over, you should assume they lie about everything, and tell them that. You should assume that it will never be possible to get a truthful answer. You should ask yourself why you stay with someone you don't trust?|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Honest answer, no, you can't. It is classified.<br>  <br>  But you CAN, corroborate credit records and things of this nature to find out if he is telling the truth.<br>  <br>  If he is the type of guy that you say he is, get rid of him anyway. No-one needs someone that is untrustworthy around.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because he was in the Navy doesn't mean that he was a SEAL.|`|RtkB46peaa	WOW!  Are you so excited to find another fault in your husband that you're willing to call up the government to check his military record?  What possible good could come from it?  I guess you'll be able to lecture  him one more time about catching him in a lie that can't possibly help your relationship.

After you do that, quit worrying about the EX and don't badger your husband about her.   They had a family together and you can't make that go away.  They apparently loved each other once.   That doesn't mean he wants her back or that she wants to control him.  It means you walked into a marriage with a man who has family history.   He married you and the two of you are one now.  Not 3.   It's good that they speak kindly to each other.  That means they have the ability to forgive.   You may need that from him later.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	You need to have a discussion with the guidance of a marriage counselor.
tvK1xjzkaa	well for starters it depends on how the doctor performed the vasectomy. My hubby had his cut, burnt and tied. However some doctors do different procedures. It boils down to how it was performed if it can be reversed. Also, if it can't you can do a procedure where they can go in with a needle and inject  you with his sperm. Either way it will be expensive. I would talk with your hubby first and contact a doctor and see what you can do.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Not a big chance. But vasectomies are reversable.

vnDHdtSZaa	She's obviously nothing better to talk about or nothing better going on in her life so she has to talk about yours. She could be jealous, if she sees how happy you and your boyfriend are and wishes she was in a relationship like that. If what she is doing is annoying you i think you should say it, it isn't horrible to say 'stay out of my business'. I think you should sit her down and tell her ( in the nicely possible way ) that it's YOUR relationship and not hers so she should stay out of it. Believe me it's the best way, i've been here myself and know how annoying it can be.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	just nosy. you need to tell her to butt out and that even though she may have good intentions, you don't like it and will stop talking to her unless she stops it.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Sounds more like she's a lesbian thats hot for you. She needs some Vitamin D of her own and a life.

I later found out they were for his mistress.<br>  Take the perfumes and hide them. If he bought them for you, he'll ask if you've seen them. If they weren't for you he probably wouldn't have the balls to ask if you've seen it.<br>  If he is having an affair his mistress must really smell foul.

Sometimes once you get something like that in your head you start jumping to conclusions every time there could possibly be a connection. It is possible that your mind is running away with you. I would confront him about the perfumes. Holding all of this inside is not going to do yourself any good, and it definitely will be detrimental to your marriage...even if he isn't being unfaithful. Talk to him about the perfumes and try and hear him out with an OPEN mind...and if you really can't believe him - tell him so. Tell him that you don't believe him and tell him why. Make him realize that he isn't getting away with anything and that you are serious about leaving him because you won't stand for an unfaithful husband. He will realize the gravity of the situation and either prove to you somehow that he really isn't cheating...or the alternative is that he gives in and admits to it. But no matter what happens - knowing is much better than always wondering. I wish you the best of luck!|`|yOHCXiaMaa	OK Bandstand!!<br>  <br>  I have seen two decent answers here.  One get a detective and two why care if you are going to leave.<br>  <br>  So women think (as well as men) that a marriage license is a ownership clause.  Why would you lower yourself and degrade yourself by snooping on the computer or getting into your husbands phone or phone records.  And since you females are so smart did you ever think he might have two   cell phones and the bill for the second goes to another address.  WAKE UP.  If he is going to carry on on the computer did you ever think he might purchase a lap top he keeps hidden and goes on line with a wireless to chat other women up with another name and profile.  CHEE!!  And I am not just talking about men here...women cheat too.  I have three phones from three different servers going to three addresses.  One is for business.  One is for my friends and one is to call myself incase I lose the other two (which I actually did once) and I have it at my sisters.  She uses it cause she can't afford one on a fixed income and needs it when she travels.<br>  <br>  Look if you are serious.  Get a PI.  It won't take him long to prove it and it is going to cost less than your self esteem, a shrink or 30 yrs in the slammer.  Until you can do this just keep your eyes open.  Forget following him yourself.  Enlist a friend with an unknown car and face. Make life more interesting at home with a little extreme action and if he doesn't respond you pretty well know something is wrong.  BE CAREFUL!!  And last but not least...don't blame the other woman till you know all the facts.  Some men are really good liars.<br>  <br>  One fact most don't know..if you call someone and she tells you things you don't want to hear... ask questions only a person who has been intimate can answer.  Remember many of these women don't have a reason to lie to you.  <br>  <br>  My husband told his mistress that I was a screamer, that he and I hadn't lived together in two years and he had asked for a divorce.  So it stumped her when I answered the house phone.  We had a long talk and after it was over...I gave him his divorce and she gave him the boot|`|zC2900V8aa	You can hire an investigator to catch him which can be anything from 20.00 or 50.00 an hour.  It is a big pricey but if your looking for proof for divorce court then that may be a good way to have solid evidence.  OR you can be the investigator and follow him for a day (borrow someone elses car and tinted windows help).  Have a friend go and do it even better!  It's not hard to do really and if you do it that way make sure you take good pictures and use self control because he probably isn't worth going to jail for.  You can also get really great stuff from spy stores that have devices that you can use to track him or record phone conversations from his phone.  I would check that cell phone bill and call some numbers you don't recognize too!  I would suggest going out on your own too!  Go out and stay late and flip the script and see how he likes it.  When he asks whats up give him the same answers he gave you!  I used to have a boyfriend who acted that way so every night when I knew he may be coming home I would get all dressed up like I was going out and go to walmart or a friends house and come home later than him and when he asked where I was I said why so many questions do you have a guilty concience?  I would have taken the perfume out to and been like OMG thank you is this for me???  lol
azdw8fMlaa	Tell your mom you don't feel like you have anything in common with her, and she makes you uncomfortable. As for the girl, your best bet is to be honest and tell her you are not interested in being her friend so maybe she should hang out somewhere else. Then work on getting acquainted with other kids in your class. Remember it's up to you who you want to be friends with - not your mom or anybody else. Put your own feelings first, and hopefully you'll make lots of new friends at your new school in no time.

There really isn't a way necessarily to say that you don't want to be friends without hurting their feelings. But I guess the drifting away move might work. But don't be mean to her. Maybe she's so desparate for a friend that she takes advantage of your kindness. Just do what you think would be the right thing to do and tell your mom how you feel and ask her to stop inviting the girl without your permission.|`|ahujYDBdaa	Well you cant exactly tell someone that you dont want to be their friend anymore, I guess you're just going to have to drift away.

xmmX3JTRaa	Your husband deserves a fair "trial" so you should do it before he leaves. Please be fair with him. no matter what happen he gave you a part of his life and you should treat him fair.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Go ahead and file.  It doesn't make any difference.  He can still get an attorney and they can fight it out in court (about child visitation.)  Good Luck :)|`|AA12022384	The court will tell you wherever your husband lives that you have to let him have reasonable access and that does mean at his home and convenience as well as yours. <br>  <br>  Unless you can prove he is an unfit father they will see your request as unreasonable.  Your child needs to know its father and have a good relationship to grow up and feel a complete person.  If you stop this or make it very difficult there will come a time when your child will resent or even hate you for stopping this happening.<br>  <br>  My mother continually put difficulties in the way of my father and I  seeing and communicating with each other and when  I was growing up and I never forgave her for that.  She also used to say awful things about him and that made me feel like a terrible person because I was part of him, don't make those mistakes for both you and your child's sake.<br>  <br>  I am not saying you are doing both these things but I know how angry and hurt you can be during and after a divorce and when we are this upset we sometimes do things we would not normally do.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Not really. When it comes to child custody/support/visitation the courts watch very carefully that everyone is treated equally and fairly. So if you get custody, the summer visits with him where he lives may be theprice to pay but it beats the usual visits that states require like every other weekend and one day during the week eery other week and alternating holidays and birthdays. Chances are you wont get everything you request here so compromise on somethings. Good luck|`|0KLu4hRaaa	You should face him like a grown up and if he wants the child for the summer you should let him or her go...if you use your child as a pawn (weapon to hurt the other parent or get your way) then you will ultimately pay for that decision. Children grow into adults and when they find out one parent tried to hinder the other parent's involvement without just case you can bet your kid will be extremely hurt and angry with you. TRUST ME!!|`|MVxFOI5naa	Give him a week a month for june, july and august or may, june and july however your school years works out even if your child is not in school that's a fair exchange also give him mid winter and spring break-its a good time for you to have some alone time!Don't cut him out of your child's life it's not fair to either of them.|`|TMOILyUnaa	is this a limbo? cuz how low can you go!|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	This is pretty nasty....<br>  Who's to say he won't file first? Its best to sit down and try to discuss this and come to an agreement. Personally, him having the summers and you having the REST of the year is not unfair. This child needs to see his/her father just as much as he/she sees you. <br>  There comes a point when you have to set aside your current feelings for the man and do what is best for the kid. Keeping the child away, or trying to make it difficult for him to see the child is NOT what is best for him/her. It will only cause more pain for the child.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	i think it would be better to wait til he leaves.<br>  <br>  but my question is (if you don't mind my asking) why don't you want him to have your child for the summer? isn't it good enough that he still wants to be in the childs life? cuz alot of men wouldn't continue to be good dads.<br>  <br>  my advice would be let your kid go for a week or two in the summer, if they enjoy it then they can go back for another few weeks.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Divorces are messy and when you have kids they get messier.

Personally, I'm completely comfortable with gays and lesbians. I can even joke around about it with them. It all depends on your views of the subject.<br>  If you still want to be her friend, then just make it obvious to her that you aren't into girls. And if your not comfortable around her, then I would suggest you don't hang out with her anymore because a forced friendship isn't fair to anyone.|`|saRNROlmaa	Well if she touches you and you don't like it, tell her to stop.<br>  If she doesn't, leave her, because a good friend wouldn't hurt you.|`|24d92bd0241aeea71cccfaf017c6c707aa	Is there any part of you as a woman that feels interessted when she behaves like that?

It is not something that should cause you to change who you are because then the so called "friends" you make that way wont know who you really are. What you can do is maybe ask some of the people you get along with/hang out with at school, if they wanted to make a mall trip or something with you over the weekend. Or, if there are events coming up at school, such as sports events and such, you could ask them if they wanted to go with you.|`|447bbddf154b588962d162861f58f165aa	Maybe you just haven't found the right friend yet, you kno like how you find a right life partner. You can turn your hi/bye friends into friends like when you see them, instead of just going 'hi', you can say 'hi how's you day?' and start a conversation from there.<br>  <br>  And when you don't know what to say:<br>  <br>  Say you're with a bunch of friends, and they are having a discussion. Why don't you try giving comments or maybe crack up some jokes? This really helps cause this warms people up to you.<br>  <br>  The only reason I have friends is because I'm not afraid to say anything. I'm always in conversations because i put myself in it. You don't just sit beside and not talk and wait for someone to ask for your opinion you know? You have to put yourself out there, have a little confidence about what you're saying. It's okay if you say the wrong thing because that's where you will learn|`|tNfsKZwgaa	don't be a *****.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	Join some clubs and go to some school functions with a few friends. Your friends will start talking to more friends and before you know it, you'll be making friends left and right. But if you think you want some new friends, go to a club; it's great because you have friends that share the same interests or belief. Or after your last class, if you're not in a sport, you can walk home with some friends.|`|kDab6zpTaa	i had the same problem, i am also a freshman and i changed that this year.just straight up tell people "we really need to hang out sometime" or ask what they are doing later.at my school a lot of people stay after and we all just hang out at the school, then walk to the restuarant thats really close to our school.good luck|`|JzYlReESaa	give it time, assuming your not an alienated loner at school, friendships will eventually forge. don't expect lots of strong friendships, a couple mabey but lots of casual acquaintances. give it time though, it could be a year at least.|`|FRNDkLNqaa	Take part in activitys.<br>  Try working together on school work during class.<br>  Make jokes. yada yada yada.|`|7minC5Evaa	Why you want friends?                                 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Meh, family? hah?|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	get rid of everything about yourself that is making you unconfident|`|BTLt4sKEaa	invite them over your house or to a movie or something.<br>  ask what they are doing after school, maybe they will invite you over.|`|WeNWlYT4aa	who needs friends anyway|`|7InTn4E4aa	Well that happened to me last year too. I was always on the bus so when I wanted to see my friends after school they would always walk, so maybe if you have friends that walk and if you can, then when your walking home you can invite them to your place. Or maybe just be more friendly, compliment them and just warm up to them. Good Luck!|`|4aNNniauaa	The only way to build stronger bonds is hanging with them after school. Think about a few people that you know and then try to incorporate yourself with them, or try one person. Make sure to not seem pushy. But if you overhear something like a friend is going to the movies to see lets say Halloween, say something like "I saw the previews and it seems pretty cool, when were you going to go?" If they respond nicely then keep it going from there.|`|i9421OOYaa	Dont be a wannabe! Thats all I have to say. Make yourself prettier, try and act like a slut, guys will like you and you will make friends because you will be using the guy, unless you actually like him. That is how I get around! Let people come to you, and if that doesn't work then try texting them "heey! wanna meet up sometime soon =P" trust me they will go for it! Try to be friends with a wide variety of people. Pick one "clique" that you think will accept you and you want to be friends with them. Don't choose the extremely popular people, because they make friends from the start and if they do make friends later on, they are fake to them. Trust me, I know. I used to be unpopular, but I pushed my way to the popular group, and started acting like a slut but NEVER admitted it. THIS WORKS!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|TCud8XbIaa	1.

f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	I read your question and it made me feel very sad.  You have 7 years and 3 children with a man that does not feel that you are his partner.  I am also saddened that there is no mention of love between you or friendship. That is a very sad state of affairs.  <br>  <br>  I am also troubled that you don't seem to have a lot of information concerning your own life.  You really don't seem to know what is happening or why.<br>  <br>  1. Why do you feel his parents are putting "stuff" in his head?<br>  2. What stuff?<br>  3. Why would they do this? <br>  4. What could they have to gain?<br>  5. What is your relationship with the parents? <br>  6. Have you discussed your concerns with them? <br>  7. What do they say concerning any of this?<br>  8. Have you discussed your feelings & concerns with your boyfriend?<br>  9. What is his explaination for any of this?<br>  10. Do you have a job?  <br>  11. Do you contribute financially?  <br>  12. Have you considered couples therapy?  <br>  13. Do you have a church pastor or rabbi that can help?<br>  14. Have you sought any advice from an attorney?  <br>  15. Is your family available to help you?<br>  16. What is your mother & fathers input into this?<br>  <br>  I don't need answers to these questions but you do.  You need to evaluate your life and determine how you got into this situation. You also need to make a plan for your life so that you are participating in it.  What is the best outcome here?  How can that be achieved?<br>  <br>  Marriage is tough and it is hard to make it even with love and trust between 2 people. You have 3 children to consider.  While I am never an advocate of staying in abusive or destructive relationships I also can not say that you should tell them to "kiss my *#@" and walk out.  This is not a plan.  Whether you want to repair your relationship or end your relationship, you need help & you need a plan.  <br>  <br>  Your current relationship sounds devoid of trust and friendship.  I am sure that you feel lonely and isolated.  I know that must make you feel angry & hurt.  <br>  <br>  So, look at my list of questions.  Think of what you want; envision your life. Start planning and working toward change & improvement.  No major life changing action should ever occur on a whim.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	YOU...................YES YOU created this mess.You had not one but 2 count them 2 kids with a guy who does not trust you as far as he can throw a tractor trailer load of elephants, he does not love or respect you and has no intention of EVER committing to you.<br>  However you can still get half his stuff due to common law marriage which you are not married but shacking.Check your state laws and see what you can get out of the relationship if you leave.However, you'll be destroying your children's home.They are the ones who will suffer if you leave.|`|6gK5dzTdaa	If everything is okay then why throw away a 7 year relationship?

Well, if you do maybe they could help make her back off! If you believe in God also, you might want to pray. But if you don't, it's ok if you don't. I hope this bully thing works out! :D Good Luck Girl!!!|`|ETfgBxUbaa	get a pasey or get a girlfriend use her 4 1 day to scare the **** out of people it works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|UH67GysTaa	did u tell ur counseler this? maybe she could help with that too. otherwise id change classes and tell her the girls name but try not to make it look obvious good luck!!!|`|pVpQuWXzaa	Don't let her scare you.

Hgl55oshaa	Hey meme,<br>  If a guy is approached by an attractive woman chances are he's going to cheat on you. Then again it's all about timing & willingness.

JdwogVjAaa	just be there for him and ask him to be honest with you|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Theres no way someone cuts themselves "purposely" like cutting, and not know they did it. Cut marks are a distinct mark you can tell. <br>  <br>  So have you even seen the marks.

I'm serious. The same thing happens to me. I remember there was a boy I liked, and we hung out, and one day he just randomly told me I was a really good friend. I kind of laughed it off, but then he was like, "No, a REALLY good friend." At first I thought, "Does this just mean he wants to be friends?" but later on I realized that by "REALLY good friend" (perhaps like "best friend EVER") he really meant that he wanted to date me. And he DID want to date me. He flat admitted it to friends who later admitted it to me. Sometimes guys get intimidated, so before you can shoot them down they're like, "Oh! We're just friends!" skipping a whole relationship right into the friends zone.
jiaxTmj6aa	Hey, i'm 13 as well<br>  I have a few online friends but im not really close with any of them but one and we're pretty close. We met in a chatroom/game thing then we traded MSN's.<br>  <br>  I have no intention of even thinking about meeting him until i'm older.<br>  <br>  one of my mums friends has a 17 year old daughter who wanted to meet someone offline. So she arranged to go with her parents to a cafe, and the other person arranged his parents to go to the same cafe with him so they could meet safety. It worked well.<br>  <br>  You think about not telling your parents.... thats a very, very stupid thing to do. There are people who work over a very long time to manipulate children into trusting them. I'll never forget an article about a girl (our age) who had been friends with a person they met online for 4 years, first IM then phone. She arranged to meet this person who she believed to be one year older then her without telling her parents. She got to the cafe and a 50 year old man was waiting for her.<br>  <br>  Its pretty sick.<br>  <br>  You cant ever be sure of who your speaking to. There are lots of bad people in this world but lots of good ones. Bide your time with this girl and talk to your parents about her.<br>  <br>  <br>  -If you arrange a meeting TAKE SOMEONE WITH YOU<br>  -Even if she's showed you pictures they could be of a younger sister or niece etc<br>  -be careful, please<br>  -Tell your parents<br>  <br>  Good luck and I urge you to take everything in<br>  Anya|`|aexekiU9aa	yea..<br>  i have some online friends..<br>  but we're not really close..<br>  <br>  but they're nice..<br>  i like to make friends..

So she may not be BI at all, she may just like the male attn. she recieves, or she isn't sure if she idolizes women or wants to be with them.

Wf8PbTraaa	if you have a crush on him you can like him yet be professional.<br>  <br>  if you wanna stay away from work relationships the best way to do that is probably to just find some new guy you like.|`|YE0baNYRaa	change the job coz its really difficult to control the feelings|`|03d02ccfb35b78c46d0906cedf98349daa	find another job. Or just  keep the feelings seperate in the workplace, I don't know. Ive been in the same situation and ive never has a problem with it|`|YniG6IiGaa	how i did it is i just started flirting with other guys and found some one else to like :)|`|wlhMUwKsaa	The way I deal with it is to remember...."everybody poops".|`|J05AvuuXaa	become straight.|`|pEjujCuraa	try talking to him about it...you never know, he might feel the same way.|`|xSNpSlE7aa	try getting more into someone else.<br>  <br>  I recommend TV.
uuMCGT9taa	no we both say WE went here or there.     but that sounds wierd to say i took .     ur friend is a weenie sorry to say !|`|PyUDK9IGaa	"i was dragged to such and such a place and made to do this and that"|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I say, we went ________. I say that because whenever we go out, we split the bill 50/50. It would be different if one of us was always the one who paid. Then, I'd say, I took him/ he took me _________.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Hm I think my husband says both to people...Not really on purpose or to be rude.|`|1hsOl8Idaa	I say "we went to...." or " we've been there"    strange!|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I know when my husband wants to make a point of the effort he put into a date or planning an event, he will say "I took Jackie to Kansas City for the weekend as a surprise".  And I also say "Kevin surprised me and took me to KC for the weekend!"      But if it was just out to dinner and wasn't anything really planned or special, then it "We went to Arby's for dinner last night".
haWw3B8aaa	I would give her an 8 because she's cute and she looks very friendly.|`|vl8ND1qVaa	well first of all why should our answers matter if you already know the CORRECT  answer already. If she is pretty and has a beautiful smile to you than u don't need a second opinion. People have there own prettiness you can say. Everyone is different in what kind of person they are attracted too.|`|belxnL86aa	wtf? omg your taste in girls is horrible. god I've never seen anyone so terribly uglier than her. where do you find your women? oh god no id give her a 0. jesus christ put a bag over that donkeys head for christ sake. holy crap.|`|r9wrDGm2aa	shes really not good looking at all... but mayb thats just me  but hey its whats on the inside that counts!|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	IF she looks good to you .. thats all that matters.    Be happy.
9nTrd7Tnaa	No, physical contact with someone else can be very comforting. If you knew him well, or were at least friends with him, this shouldn't be a bad thing. If he did calm down and didn't jerk his hand away when you did this, I think you're golden. As far as you having a crush on him, I don't think it was too extremely obvious at this point. You were just trying to cheer him up, not hit on him.|`|sEq75g5Zaa	I was going to say no until you said that you have a crush on him. He probably sensed it. But maybe that's what you want anyway.|`|IfS1VnSKaa	I wouldnt even worry about it if you like him. Maybe he likes you too. I'd say go for it.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	I think you should just see the deletion and then you would no what to do. Yeah you cross the line like johnny...and sue or was that WALK the line? Maybe you shouldn't drink so much!   lol...lol...|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	No .. it sounded right for the moment.... even if you were trying to send a message .. He won't get it. It's a guy thing.|`|FIV3ClQsaa	i don't think you crossed the line at all.i would personally do that without even giving a second thought.I think you were flirtatious though-harmless in my eyes.And yes you made it obvious that you have a crush on him especially if you touched him for a considerable length of time.And yeah you tend to over-analyse everything.|`|k73IxCHaaa	By touching his hand you showed him that you cared. However, it could be interpreted as something totally different, I think you get my drift. If you get an opportunity to take it to the next level, no harm no foul. If he likes you he'll make the next move. As for the action itself, I don't see anything wrong with it, some women are touchy feely types and that's how they express themselves. In some cases in means something in others it does not. If this guy has any interpersonal skills at all, he will know the difference.    Hope it works out for you.|`|7CtV0xuTaa	if you were his friend i dont think so but you were just helping wich is  a good thing|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	Nah! Just give it time and see what happens.|`|ejJD6BBXaa	no u were not u were just trying to help. but if u keep mentioning it then it might end up weired but dont keep thinkin ab it and dont keep asking him ab it|`|AA11706291	No not at all just carry on like it didn't happen as to him it was probably a bit of a none event.|`|71VRvldJaa	I don't think what you did was inappropriate at all considering the circumstances.  It sounds like something you did very spur of the moment and you accomplished what you set out to do.....end of story!    Where you would be crossing the line is letting this crush you have on him get any stronger.  There is absolutely no good that can come of relationships with co-workers.  It won't last, it will cause problems with other employees and one if not both of you would likely end up losing your job.    Next time you go to happy hour, find a different place to sit!
NBDLUOkiaa	Only if he would allow me to open one full of heterosexual male dancers. Fair is fair you know!|`|y9CgveCGaa	Sure, if she wanted to.|`|NSKimt1Qaa	Sure, I wouldn't care (I know it would never happen, though).  He'd be working and making money, and I am past caring about things like that.  I think we could get our separate places then.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	as long as he won't dance.. <br>  then we would loose business.|`|0X33btOfaa	I knew someone who let her husband to do that and she thought it was fun and he gave her lots of cash and she went on shopping sprees...a year later they were divorced after she found out one of the strippers became her hubby's gf.....so its not really a wise move unless u dont care whether he end up with some of the strippers etc...|`|yZ9bSoyUaa	No, not because I would worry about him cheating or being tempted but simply for that the fact that he would be aiding people in supporting their corrupt habits.|`|qJxXS6luaa	Absolutely, I plan to retire to Texas and the wife wants to open one there. It's all about fun and making money.|`|SQe4ghfdaa	My boyfriend wouldn't do it, honestly. But if he wanted to then sure he can do it....he'd just better not touch those bitches.|`|5b97d2edb86616427fbc10f6f183478faa	well..........I wouldnt be his spouse for long, and vice versa. That kind of vocation is just asking for trouble.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	Yes, but only if it was a male strip club.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	SURE, He would own or operate it a single man!!|`|ze7xiJwTaa	It would bring in some decent money. Crappy hours, but why not? And fun too!|`|17tCOTj5aa	Sure would. I don't care how that bacon gets on the table, as long as there's lots of it.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I wouldn't even let him go to a strip club.  (not that he would want to anyways)|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Absolutely! I want to be on that one!
NSKimt1Qaa	Marsha, that's so funny - someone asked me just tonight whether my husband might have PMS!  My husband must have reverted to his trashy roots very soon after the marriage.  It was a gradual process that seemed to happen simultaneously with his career change.  The guy graduated college with a degree in business administration and threw it away.  I know he told me he grew up in a rough neighborhood and his dad was from the Old Country (Poland) and had Old World ideas.  It wasn't until he was 16 or 17 when his parents moved out of the bad area to a much better environment, but by that time, he was already used to life on "the other side of the tracks".  He also was heavily influenced by his dad, who he greatly admired.  I found out the week of the wedding my husband was not as easy-going as I thought. He has a terrible temper and I think the reason we could stay married so long was that he was away from home a lot with his job.  Now, he has sort of mellowed (compared to what he was) and he can go as long as 2 months before he lets his anger get out of control.  Still, I think it's due to the fact that I am usually careful not to light his fuse.  <br>  I did not come from a trashy background.  I think my parents saw through my husband before I did.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	If my husband ever thought i was trashy i would not be able to look him in the face because i would know he didn't really love me to judge me so harshly just because i can be a little weird at times.|`|1uRUaSblaa	All marriages have their ups and downs. At times<br>  , the old mean ways do crop up and well....just <br>  gotta work things out with much mutual talk <br>  and tolerance.:)|`|FMfAcAGpaa	Maybe monthly, like PMS?|`|3iNobwVraa	Apparently, it is a rare person who overcomes poor breeding.  Research shows many people become replicas of their parents.  I would have never thought it possible.  So do you turn someone down based on those from whence they came?  I really don't have an answer, and you can't generalize from one to many, but the research and personal experience have certainly made me wonder.  Maybe being a snob (not about money, blah blah, but about character) isn't a bad thing after all???|`|dprURFLxaa	HaHA!  Yes sir.  I tease him all the time about it - he knows it and jokes about it to.<br>  <br>  It's like the say goes..."You can take the b*tch out of the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out of the b*tch"...<br>  <br>  And of course you can replace ghetto with hillbilly, or other politically correct term...and I replace b*tch with...oh wait...no...I guess I don't...poor guy...|`|29ef3b425c997be8f850f8ab0a765cfcaa	So you think your better than her.It is time to leave.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	My husband turns gay on the weekends. I wonder what that says about his background.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	no mine got better thanks to me ,,
s0qrPl5saa	I'm crap at english so you should probably ignore this :D<br>  <br>  I'd take it as meaning you have like.. Label them? Just saying where they came from, who said them and when, I think :)|`|m8f7rnBEaa	With a can of spray paint.
JZK40k7Paa	well you need to stop expecting something out of them. You are trying to pose as someone impressive so that you can create a good impression. The reason i used to do this is because i wanted to leave a 'mark' on the girls so i can increase my chances in impressing them.  I dunno if its the same for you, but i realized how stupid my approach was and i stopped it.|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	you sound like a complete **** to be honest :) :) (sound familiar???)|`|9QyrW2iCaa	Pick up the book Byron Katie's "Loving What Is" and the CD series.  You can buy them online used for very little.  Read the book, listen to the CDs.  Your life will transform and you'll get all kinds of other questions answered.  Seriously.  It's going to take some effort on your part if you truly want to ease these feelings.  Caring for others is great, for sure, but can lead to getting into relationships where you are the over responsible one.  I also HIGHLY recommend reading "Boundaries" by Cloud and Townsend--another book you can get online.  Good luck and best to you!  : )
ScaAyzKHaa	There's no reason to hate yourself. Your sister can't handle being responsible for herself (so much easier to blame the people you're freeloading off of), all you can do is wait for her to calm down and decide she isn't upset anymore. After, y'all can sit down and talk about how you feel taken advantage of because you help so much and never get thanked.|`|1TQTw2bnaa	Your sister sounds irresponsible. I'm not surprised that she's ignoring you now, since you told her the truth about your feelings. She's taking all of the help that she's getting wtih HER child for granted.
2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	I think that women, especially if children are involved, take more time over making the decision to leave.|`|8nGZV6ufaa	One over the other is not any different...Cheating is cheating...there is no better way of saying or doing that.  I really do not know the statistics in numbers and ratios to this...but it would be a good thing to know and understand, I think...Take care.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	cheating is cheating; man, woman or troll. the point is no one should ever put up with that bs.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	i think looking at this from a male/female perspective is not the best way to get your questions answered.  Not all men are the same, and that goes for women of course.  It all depends on how deep someones feelings are for that particular person.   regrets are on both sides, this is an ideological question not a male/female question.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Sweetie you are so hurt right now and that sounds like you are grasping at straws to reason why your wife left. On my end the men are cold hearted cheaters and don't hardly blink and eye about it. If it makes you feel any better though it is me that could walk out of my marriage the cheater with a cold heart. I believe it is probably even on either living with regrets and trying to reconcile.|`|KbZIsj7Caa	cheating is cheating no matter who does it for what reason. after the cheating is done, im sure both parties have their regrets, and some tend to miss what they had after awhile and some don't,  and they both leave for one reason or another, it could be because of something major going on, or something very petty. Im sure my ex regretted the day I left him, he doesnt have it as good anymore, but I  didn't have any regrets about leaving( he was into drugs real bad) I had a child to protect. so I mad the only decision there was.|`|AA11812482	totally agree bro! women are cold hearted and dont give a f**k, while us guys are way more vulnerable....its the sad truth|`|5b2Bhpvnaa	Cheating is cheating...but I feel that men and women do it for entirely different reason. Women tend to cheat to feel a connection to someone because they lack that from their current relationship. Some women make up the decision to cheat based on a more emotional/mental way whereas some men do it on just a sexual perspective. Men let their testosterone do the deciding for them on acting on impluse which never quite works out; which in turn leads them on trying to get back their old relationship.|`|coZ7Fm79aa	this is what i have learned...women are stubborn and i think deep down they care about more of their pride then men well im talking in general here there's obviously pple who are different but from what ive seen men are more willing to admit they are wrong even when they arent men will let their guard down but women wont they feel like the man can hurt them more if they let guard down and come back they show weakness and just from experience women dont like to do that they dont like to completely open up idk if that makes much sense but it's my way of seeing it|`|z4iETkpsaa	It all depends on the person..  I don't think gender/sex has anything to do with it. I know that when I leave my husband, it would have been after yrs of planning so I will certainly be less likely to regret it or ever dare consider reconciling.     It depends on the reason the person is leaving to begin with.|`|AA11587827	well as u know a woman can go anywhere and pick up another man, if she is half way good looking a woman could have a different man every day, its not that easy for men, they may regret leaving but like i said they can have another man that night if they want, its sad to say ,but if u leave one for another its not that bad to deal with, as long as u go straight from one to the other, its when ur all alone that u start to think and thats when it starts to bother you, and most men and women will not leave unless they have someone else waiting for them
AMXMZLjZaa	If someone does that I say  "You know what, I totally agree"|`|9jMJeVOhaa	that or they may be looking for confidence they don't have.
VBFwT9nVaa	I forgot where I read this, but supposedly women are really sexually active during late 20's, early 30's while men it's early 20's.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	i hope so cause that is my age(27 almost 28) and i have a very high sex drive.|`|WKtakdsOaa	My sex drive has been very, very high since I was 16 and it doesnt matter. Just enjoy|`|TkUF1PI4aa	Yes maam. I was & still am @ 29 at my peak LOL~|`|v2a220YWaa	Why would you be married to someone that raped you?  Did it happen before or after you were married?  Either way, why is this even a question?|`|qUvodeIbaa	i have a veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy high sex drive and i thought maybe i was just a freak but i see its just the age<br>  im also 27|`|uVv8lsgxaa	yes men have it from the ages of 16-30 and us women have our from 24-mid thirties to early fourties|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	yes, I think it's perfectly normal. I had my highest at 28.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	My sex drive isn't very high... but I guess I'm out of the norm, I'm 26.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	at 20-40 women are blasting along at the speed of light.<br>  <br>  you should enjoy this period as it won't last forever. so if you are married, use your female magic to have your spouse take advantage of this magical gift you have. remember, some women only wish.<br>  <br>  once you lose it, it may never comes back. and if you don't move it you could lose it. so move it.<br>  <br>  best wishes and happy movement.
bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	keep the friendship<br>  <br>  sometimes guys feel the love but are afraid to risk losing a friendship to a relationship. That is, he might be worried to make the commitment or think that if the relationship goes wayward, that it might ruin your friendship. <br>  <br>  That is why he feels you should just be close friends.|`|IwTnhhJ7aa	It means he wants to do the physical stuff and tell you he loves you but not be in the relations hip and be tyed down with having a constant girlfriend. he still wants to play the field|`|PMcBWLCxaa	if i was in this position and i had a best friend who i was in love with and he said he was in love with me and that im the only one for him, and he wouldn't be in a relationship...i would end it. its not fair to you to be stuck with someone you can't have. maybe it was a friends with benifits thing? idk, but dnt let him act like he owns you. remember, dnt settle because you think you cant get someone else.
NZ5vDBTXaa	He's only telling you that he loves you so he feels less guilty of the situation. He also doesn't want you to think that he's a ******** which he is. But if somebody truly loves you, they would be with you no matter what.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	he wants to play the field and sow his seed far and wide.|`|GBC39wHAaa	Let him go no matter what he says. He's basically being selfish thinking that he can control you. He's not in love with you, different from saying he loves you. If it's because you are overweight, then he is shallow and not worth it. Love is really blind sort to speak he would look beyond all that if he were truly in love with you.|`|9EkFrApiaa	It means he cares deeply for you as a friend but he is not in love with you.  I am sorry, that must hurt, but it is true.|`|bYU77eteaa	It means he loves you but aint in love with you<br>  find someone who will fall in love with you|`|osoTq2dcaa	It is about sex even though he says its not ... honestly he just wants you to be wrapped around his finger with out having to do anything ... so he says i love you|`|R5fM3lewaa	he doesnt wanna ruin anything... hes doing it to protect ur friendship|`|1uRUaSblaa	Guess he likes you but not ready for any relationship.<br>  Why not just move on and take him as a good friend?<br>  Don't pin too much hope and emotions on him anymore.<br>  You have said all you need to say.<br>  When he is ready, he will come to you.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	you got me on that one. but my feeling is that unless you're a porn star, when feelings start to kick in, you're basically doomed since there's no real way to channel hormones to any particular place.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	he means he loves you as a friend, but not as a girlfriend. you should try to accept that and move on.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Try to move on if you can.|`|tUHzB4laaa	men are assholes, treat him like crap and he will be your lap dog|`|cMEwV8V3aa	he doesnt wanna have ur babies thats what it means|`|p8fpxlQBaa	talk it out if ur such good friends|`|cDC1FHTDaa	Sometimes best friends last longer than any relationship. But what is wrong with that? Why can't he just be your best friend? You can never have too many friends. Keep him as a friend and get on with your life. Who know? Maybe after you are gone he just might realize that he did more that lose a friend, he just might have lost his future wife.|`|aoOhcBnAaa	It means Just what he said.  He likes you as a friend, not as a romantic love interest.  You can either accept this and be content with remaining just friends or put your relationship in danger by aggressively pursuing his love.  The choice is yours.|`|SQe4ghfdaa	He doesn't want a relationship because he is insecure, he has another woman, and/or he doesn't want to hurt your feelings because he feels like you love him more than he loves you.<br>  <br>  Some guys are jerks...|`|E71iQB4Maa	Maybe he loves you, but isnt ready for a relationship.<br>  My friend, a boy, loves me but isnt IN love with me.

All the best, may things work out for u|`|8UnSNDPxaa	it leans he loves you, but he's not in love with you'<br>  he wants to remain best friends|`|Om6Tni92aa	Well, I think he just want your companionship and honestly; I don't think he loves you.|`|BNrQSYwhaa	He loves you as as friend.|`|ZJz87tUCaa	dont ask US~!<br>  ask him sweetie!|`|EpAjTOLYaa	well...im pretty sure he LOVES you...but if ur trying to say u dont love him back then u should probably just ignore him or call him or stuff...im pretty sure he'll get the picture..=)|`|CwA2MBx8aa	I know what you are going through is really hard right now. I was in a similar situation once, and it got to a point where I had to be honest with myself and ask if this was a 'healthy' relationship for me. I was basically with a great friend who loved me, but not enough to be committed to me. Instead of laboring about what was wrong with me, I had to accept that if he didn't want to commit to me. Then I needed to move on and be open to someone who would love me the way I was. I didn't end the friendship, but I got more 'selfish' and started to be honest with myself. I really deserved more than what this guy gave me, and I was going to put myself in the position to get it by not allowing my heart to be in love with someone who didn't love me back the same way. I'm so glad I did, and I'm glad that I got 'healthier.' I was able to recognize the guys who just wanted to have fun from the ones who were more serious about me. And I worked on myself. I got to know who I was better, my likes and dislikes. I pursued my career as an elementary school teacher. 6 years later, I was in a great place and met my husband. We have been married for 5 years and we have a lovely son. Good luck!|`|rZG0xdi4aa	Relationships are really complicated and no one can truly understand it without having gone through everything you have so take all advice lightly.<br>  <br>  First off, I just kind of went through the same thing... kind of. I dated a girl for 2 years and i broke up with her, i still love her and she still loves me, but we know it needed to end. We will always be friends i hope. <br>  <br>  I don't really understand your question, but it sounds like you want a relationship and he doesn't? Look into it closely, you know how you feel. If you want him then get him. Find out what he likes and get it. If he loves you he will explain himself to you more so. If you love him, then you will do what it takes to get there. Maybe yall can keep an open relationship, but don't let it swing just one way where someone is going out and the other isn't.
zDwpGybraa	yea this is a common thing. Parents don't want to work at teaching there kids so they turn to mainstream media, so when family guy swears (which actually is not that often) they blame them for there kids downfalls.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yes, then the parents complain howcome their kids use foul language. Family guy should only be seen by adults or be taken off the air.
5d94V16uaa	I like to be really into it.  I use my mouth, tongue, lips and my hand to pump a bit.  Switch it up, focus on the head for a bit the shaft etc...  don't forget his boys, guys like that too.  sometimes i stop a bit and say something sexy to him like, " i'm gonna make you explode all over me".  I look up in his eyes sometimes while I'm "working",  that really turns guys on.  Last thing is that you don't have to restrict it to the bedroom,  try out cars, planes, bathrooms etc...  its fun.  <br>  <br>  Watch some good porno too so you can see what we do and what guys like.  There is this chick on the internet, that my b/f says it looks like she gives the perfect bjob.  Heather Brooke, try looking her up on youporn.com, its free and no spyware or crap.  My b/f and I check it out all the time, they got good stuff there...  Oh yeah just ask the guy what he likes best, the all like different stuff, and guys aren't shy about telling you what feels good to them.|`|JThgHiaoaa	Don't bite and it will be wonderful... lol|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I have no idea what that is! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|OlHFq87waa	First you get your life in order and get an education and a decent way to make a living for yourself. Then you very carefully and methodically look for the right guy for you. Hopefully someone educated and who can make a decent living and who truly respects and loves you. Then you decide to get married together. On your wedding night, you ask him what he would like to try. And THEN you will find out EXACTLY how to give the PERFECT b***j** - and it will BE TO YOUR BENEFIT AS WELL.  Get yours, too.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	are you old enough to do this? if not you do not need to know how.<br>  but if you are you need to watch a porno movie.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	it's pretty self explanatory, so if you're actually asking this question, you must be too young.|`|XxVTw5U3aa	suck it|`|HKkbqlIuaa	there's no exact science, but it's about as simple as you would think. Curl your lips around your teeth and start sucking. If you need to take a breath, or you're getting uncomfortable or about to gag, just take your mouth off for a second and start licking it. Then you won't feel uncomfortable, and he will like it. =] Good luck lol|`|J05AvuuXaa	lmao ALEX 13!!!! shes 13!!!! dudet. plzzzz, your not in love, just stop. dont even touch his weenurrrr. and have you not heard of google? theres a million answers to this out there, why you have to be such an attention whore?|`|4IyewuLuaa	lick it like a lollipop<br>  suck it like a lollipop<br>  <br>  <br>  hahaha just pretend its a lollipop and you'll be find....and the key: SWALLOW!<br>  <br>  okay have funnn girl|`|3wjOk0Saaa	If you really need to ask this question, you are too young to be thinking about it. Go back to watching Sponge Bob. KIDS|`|YymOCkWQaa	Take a hair dryer and point it at the preferred spot.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	practice with a cucumber|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Mouth on penis, then suck.|`|reNmh3rWaa	Just do it.<br>  Nike out|`|aHWGRNbDaa	Well, you have to find a comfortable position to do it first. You could be on your knees with him standing or he could be sitting. There are so many ways. I really like the 69 because it's balanced, but if you'd rather go with something more comfortable that's great. Blowjobs are very fun once you get to know what you're doing. (I'm not a whore, I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years) First you might want to get familiar with it, like kiss it or lick it just kinda warm up to it, I know it sounds wierd but trust me it helps alot. When you do it you should do it just like you do a straw, like you're trying to get the liquid out. You might want to start with doing it for short periods of time. I was on my 4th or 5th time when I finally decided I was ready to do it for a prolonged time. Don't do on the head or add teeth. It feels wierd when you do it to the head and when you add teeth that just hurts. Try balancing sucking and licking, guys love when you lick and suck at the same time. I hope I helped and I hope you have fun =]. sorry if its explicit.|`|mUWcPX6taa	I say pretend its an extremely wet frozen sucker of your favorite flavor. Suck on it, lick it around a few times while its in your mouth or out, and the part where you cant pretend its a sucker is move your head up and down at a pretty fast rate here and there. But really just experiment and explore and he'll either tell you whats good or see how he reacts and all. It shouldn't be difficult. Good Luck! :D|`|zNdY7lxpaa	its not hard, do what a lot of the other people hav said, just suck on it..haha, run your tongue up and down everyonce in awhile, you will get the hang of it, i bet u just giving it a try will make whoever this is happy..just remember to not run your teeth up on it to hard, cuz that can hurt him :)|`|yBw8EebNaa	the best way to learn is to watch a porn..second ask him what he likes don't be shy he will be more then happy to tell you how he likes it|`|QgfiXYHKaa	go to ...<br>  askmen.com<br>  -click on dating/sex<br>  find ur way through it and explore<br>  they'll walk you through it, don't worry. what's important is that you both feel comfortable and enjoy the pleasure!|`|Wf8PbTraaa	i totally wanna give you an answer but your name (more importantly the number next to it) is making me not wanna give it to ya.|`|Qnswjc6kaa	I remember when I was 14 I used to think that it involved literally blowing air through your mouth, like some sort of hair dryer.

AA11944397	That is most definitely not respectful of her to do.  I know if one of my friends was that distant and disinterested in what I was talking about even after I listened to whatever she had to say, I would distance myself from them and not spend as much time with them.  <br>  There is also an alternative explanation.  You might want to bring it up to her, she may not know that she's coming off as disrespectful and rude.  Tell her that you feel like you are a good listener and always respect her when she's talking and that you feel like you're not getting the same treatment in return.  <br>  But if you're not comfortable bringing it up to her, my best advice is not to even talk to her about personal things-and maybe start distancing yourself from her-because that is most definitely not the kind of behavior you'd expect from a real friend.|`|AA10701265	you half to think how does she feel about you are you just friends in your eyes or does she want more but by bringing up a guy she may be hinting a lil more than you think ask yourself and watch the things she says, she also might not even think that shes not doin the same fer you
PyUDK9IGaa	rose flowers 3 times|`|7vk4xoKZaa	I would say 4 is good or as many times as you want. Whenever she is feeling down you could bring her some. Just to let her know you are thinking of her. Women really pay attention to detail so you will stay in the good books if you give her the little stuff that says.. I thought about you today..and everyday... know what I mean?|`|agTCqkLDaa	365|`|L38M9lrLaa	as many times as you can|`|sl8ffVHVaa	You can give that someone special nice little things that will probably mean more then the roses that will die in 5 or 6 days. Don't get me wrong once on a while they are nice but I would rather him think of me when he sees my favorite things and bring those home to me instead|`|207dFmdHaa	first of all does your wife like flowers....if she does how much? I have always liked flowers as a surprise, not on regular holidays like Valentines Day, or my birthday. So I would say, at least once a month sometimes send her flowers at work, I did love that, just to tell me that he loves me, bring her a small bouquet home from the grocery store, a single flower laid on her pillow, they dont have to be expensive flowers, it is the thought....good luck, my rule with my husband is, if we have a fight or disagreement, dont send me flowers, that just gets me mad|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	there is no set number of times, you can do it just because.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	that totally depends, how 'high' of a maintenance your woman is.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Just how many times do you want something from her, is a pretty good estimation|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Um, I get them on special occasions, valentines, my b-day, anniversary that sort of thing. He also does it sometimes b/c he messed up or b/c I'm not feeling well or having a bad day or something. I probably get them 6 times a year. I'm happy with that.|`|AA12180527	there is no set amount of times. i think you should do it for her whenever you feel like it. not only on special occasions. but also because you want her to know that you love her and she is special. no matter what the occasion is.|`|2Y9U5jlGaa	don't do it alot. Or it won't be speical any more.  Just sometimes randomly give her flowers when she least expects it.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Anytime.|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	When ever you feel that she deserves them.|`|UfGdoHnaaa	Well.........I uess it all depends on how needy your other half is. For me roses are just a waste of money. I would prefer one rose. Even if it was picked from somones yard. It's the thought that counts, right? But some ladies just need to have someone give them flowers. It all depends.|`|AA10897992	You can do it as many times as you want, or can afford to. My boyfriend gives me roses for special occasions(which are expensive), but he surprises me with a bouquet of flowers(which can run from $5-$10) either once a week or once every other week when he notices that the last ones are dying or dead. He has been doing this for the last several months and he never ceases to amaze me. I cherish and take care of every bouquet given to me, because I know that he doesn't have to do it. That's his way of telling me that he's thinking about me and that he loves me.
Zcx9JOGXaa	you answered your own question.he want to move in|`|YHcyuka3aa	he probably was looking for signs of somethings or perhaps was just impressed by what he saw. However, he could also be casing the house as well. (not saying he was) He probably is thinking that he would love to move in and is wondering how he can manage to do it. All I can say is be careful for the next few weeks.... (seriously)|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Maybe you live in a better home than he does and he's looking at the potential the house has.<br>  <br>  Hope only your name is on the mortgage.<br>  In most states, the house is considered mutual property and either you'd have to pay him half of the value of the home, or sell it and share the profit.<br>  <br>  If you're going to take him back, you'd better sit down with a lawyer and draw up some papers that the home is yours in the matter of a divorce, and any other property you don't want him to have.|`|cDC1FHTDaa	Sometime we (guys) don't know what we have until it is gone. I don't know why he left or if you made him move out. But if it is something that you two can work out, maybe you both can take it slow and see what happens. I don't see were you say he is your "ex" husband, and I don't see the word "divorce" so who know?.. Good luck|`|rZG0xdi4aa	it sounds like he wants to talk about something but is afraid to. ask him what's up. be open towards the conversation and kind about it. Don't send him off and not listen to him, even if you don't like where it's going. You once loved him if you were married remember|`|iKJycf6Zaa	He went out, god knows what he did, who he did it with, and now he is all partied out. He needs a happy home. Son of a B*** what does he think of himself, he can leave whenever he wants and comes back when he wants to. He needs to grow up.
d2hrH6EEaa	So I'm guessing you want to get back at Ellie. Best way? <br>  walk up to her and Kara tomorrow and say:<br>  Ellie and Kara, I'm really sorry that you guys think I'm a ***** and a **** and I'm sorry if when I jokingly whacked you it hurt. I don't care if you think I am those things because I know I am not so that's what matters. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me for what I evidently did to you, as I have forgiven you."<br>  People get SOOO mad when their plans backfire! If you do that she'll feel bad trust me. It works all the time. Then just tell the teachers it was a big misunderstanding and you apologized to Ellie and are hoping she will do the same. The teachers will be happy that you apologized and will probably stay out of all of this now. <br>  Trust me it works!!!!<br>  Good luck.
cDC1FHTDaa	I was going to say "if you have to ask yourself if you want to marry or not". I was going to say wait a little. But now that you said he get "upset and punched the bedpost and gets very angry", I am telling you now to get out quick. If he is a "marine combat recon force "instructor", This is the man that is teaching his students to Relax. If he can't do that and he is the instructor.. I am telling you he is a very dangerous person, recon instructor train in hand to hand and shooting. This is a person who is supposed to be trained how to handle stress, I would say he is failing bad. You are not going to change him and if it keep on going, In most cases it only get Worth.|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	I think that you should follow your heart and choose not to marry him because its better to have realized this now instead of just dismissing your doubts and months later be married to this guy and wishing that you have listened to your heart earlier when you had the chance. However, before you choose to give up on trying to save your relationship with him just try one last time by going to those counseling sessions and possibly having him go through anger management and see where that takes the relationships and if there is a significant difference negative or positive then you should make your decision and either stay with him and marry him or move on with your life and find someone better. <br>  <br>  Since you have said that you both have been arguing alot lately and he has been getting angry alot faster and kind of taking his anger and stress out on you and himself by hitting walls and yelling, I think that there is an underlying issue that is really bothering him and its manifesting through your relationship with him and I also think it may be due to his job as working in the military having seen alot of violence and tragic/stressful situations so he may have PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). So you may want to try and get him properly diagnosed and treated so that he will learn to cope and be back to his regular self that he used to be.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck!|`|CwA2MBx8aa	First of all, I think that you really need to trust your gut feelings. I think that we both know that people's gut feelings have driven them to choose safer options (like from kidnappings, talking to strangers, and leaving abusive marriages). So, please trust your gut and not so much your head in this situation.  Second, the success of a marriage is how well a couple RESOLVES an argument. A lot of couples think that arguments are bad, but they are not. In fact, they are inevitable! I mean, come on, you guys are two separate people with different emotions and points of view. There is bound to be arguments. But the key is HOW you resolve your argument. It seems like your boyfriend's actions are on the violent side. Not only that, he seems to always think he is right and he is not a good listener. How can a person be open to resolution when they are already closing it off? <br>  <br>  I would be very, very concerned about marrying him. I would highly suggest counseling. I hope your boyfriend sees the damage his reaction has to your relationship with him. If this doesn't get dealt with, it will not only effect your marriage, it was also effect your future family in dangerous ways. I wouldn't be so worried about a "spark" to keep you in the relationship. If your heart is exhausted, then please choose wisely. Who one marries is one of the most important decisions a person will ever make.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Do not marry this man  have been resolved. I think he needs anger management.  I would be afraid to marry someone who has so little control of himself.  Go do the counseling and stuff and see where it goes but if your heart is still not in to it any more do not marry him. End it for both your sakes.|`|CD5JsjxKaa	I think it's great that you're being so honest with your feelings. a lot of women will just look at the good and ignore the bad, blaming themselves rather than looking at the situation objectively. <br>  <br>  but it's hard to say whether your relationship is doomed or is normal. honey, arguments are normal and natural. EVERY couple fights, and the ones who say they don't are liars. and yes BIG angry fights are normal. how long have you been together? they usually last the first year or so then when you two get in sync with each other they'll stop. <br>  <br>  if a couple find themselves to be compatible, they'll stick out the rough patch. if not then the rough patch will become "too much" and they'll opt out. staying isn't noble, leaving isn't weakness. this period is where your relationship is tested. if you find it's all too much then that's a sign that it isn't meant to be. if you feel that you want to make it work then that's a sign that it IS. go with what feels right for you. if you're tired, leave. if you're ready to stick through it and all then stay. only you can make that decision. know that whatever you decide it'll be the right choice.

qaMrAspCaa	if you honestly don't know which you would choose, then you shouldn't be with your current girlfriend. She deserves someone that really loves her. Stop wasting her time.  It sounds like you are really into your friend. Maybe you should take a break (or break up) with your girlfriend and spend some time thinking about what you want.  But like you said, don't cheat. That's just a bad idea. Good luck!|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Tough decision but you have to decide who you want to be with long term.

We started talking and I couldn't believe what I'd missed with the other guy. It took a lot of strength for me to leave him but now I've been with Nick for what seems like forever and we're getting married in October.

naequcqlaa	She either has a low self esteem of herself, or she is just plain hanging on because she feels he's going to change or she can change him.  I stayed in a relationship I shouldn't have because I so much wanted things different.  I just loved him so much, I was totally blinded by the truth of the matter.  I just "knew" because I wanted it so badly that it was just going to make it be.  I was told by the ones I loved to get away from it.  I just couldn't see the truth before my own eyes.  Unfortunately it did NOT change things.  For some reason, we all must find out the hard way.  But she is getting herself involved in such a serious thing.  I know you've done your best to tell her, but just keep trying.  Keep bringing up the facts to her.  Tell her that regardless of how much she wants things to turn out good, they are not.  This person is absolutely sick. He is NOT going to get better w/out the long hard help of a professional.  This I very much doubt w/happen as I'm sure he w/NOT acknowledge he has a problem.  Abusing is a very serious thing.  Tell her how much you love her & do NOT want anything to happen to her.  Try to get across to her he has a disease just like any other disease but you just cannot see it.  Ask her what she's going to do when he hurts her again, because I'm so sad to say he will.  I know oh too well, I was rite where she was.  Got beat terribly.  I finally accepted it as I was afraid for my life.  Got a restraining order against him & that was the end of it. I finally did accept the facts.  This is what she HAS to do.  I was terrified I was going to be crippled for life or worse.  Just try to keep talking to her.  Tell her you do know someone who did go back, did get beat up again, then finally accepted the truth.  He is incapable of knowing the meaning of the word love.  Chances are, he also came from an abusive family OR had a mother who abused him.  This is usually the case.  You CAN pray for her, & put her in God's Hands,  Pray that she'll come to her senses & get away from this person while she can.  I so well can sympathize for you & the position you're in.  Don't give up on her, keep after her w/all the truths you too well know.  I wish I could do more to help, but all I can do is hope for you, with you.  I DO wish you ALL the best...:)|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	She's going back because she doesn't want to be alone.<br>  And he probably sniveled and groveled for her to come back saying it will never happen again.<br>  <br>  On the average, women in abusive relationships do go back 3 times before they leave.<br>  And sometimes they leave in a body bag.<br>  <br>  It's her choice to go back to him.<br>  But it's also up to you to go check on her every day and if you see any bruising, call the cops immediately.<br>  Harass this guy until he doesn't want your daughter anymore.<br>  She may be mad at first, but she'll be grateful when she meets a guy that doesn't feel the need to use his fists on her when he's angry.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	She's abused for years.   It's almost always when they try to leave that something really bad happens.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there's not alot you can do.

I have scars on my arm from getting thrown through a glass door, I am telling you now she really needs to get out of this relationship.  It will ONLY get worse.  Do whatever you can: Call the police, put a restraining order, move her if you have to.  If he threatened to kill her, it's going to get BAD. Good luck =(|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	no one can really answer this for you but the statistics show they usually continue to abuse.they go through fazes.at first they are good because they want to appear as though they have changed. but after awhile it goes back to what it used to be and sometimes, more often than not, escalates <br>  <br>  it's important for you to be there for her no matter what she decides but do make it clear that these people never change|`|xkGfxn70aa	Stay close, and be ready.  Usually the abuse starts back. Sometimes the man comes to his senses and learns to respect his other half if he truly loves her.  Sometimes though that becomes overbearing and what they have set out to do they do.  So my advice is to stay close and watch for any sign.

Please have your daughter call and talk to someone, if not the police, then please have her talk to a counselor and let her know that there are a lot of places out there to help her.

If someone Say's there going to do something 9/10 times they do it. It took me seeing movies and seeing women I know killed from there mate just for leaving them.  Pray that God will open her heart to leave this boy..I been in a abusive relationship before and it will mess her mind up for life.  It took me  5 years to leave and I am glad I did. I prayed for a husband and God Has blessed me with a great one. I will pray for your daughter to have a change of heart.|`|hUXAA4Zcaa	Trust me, she will continue to get abused.  It's sad, but it will keep happening until she realizes.  If my ex-husband hadn't gone to jail, I may still be with him (that's what gave me time to realize life).  Hopefully, she realizes soon that she is worth a lot and doesn't deserve to be used and abused by him.  She has to realize that she deserves someone better before she is able to move on.|`|LU3TfwmYaa	it becomes worse... and worse...and honestly... how would u feel if u woke up tomorrow..and found out ur daughter is dead.... you need to do all you can to get ur daughter out of this sitiuation|`|u1uECuFNaa	She gets abused more and either lives with it for years and turns into a shell of herself or she may even end up dead.<br>  Hopefully she will eventually leave him for good.<br>  Did she file a report with the police?<br>  If she didn't, then you should know she was planning to go back to him.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	the abuse continue and god forbid it might even get worst|`|iD4ejChZaa	10 out of 10 she will definitey be abused, she will age quickly, or not live to age, eventually she will turn to things that numb her, like alcohol, pills or food, she will not make choices or decisions --she won't dare, she won't laugh much anymore or laugh with tears in her eyes, she will live in his shadow, forget her former self, it's more of a mind control, eventually she will believe everybody else is better than she is. DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. SHE WILL HIDE IT FROM YOU.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	It has the potential to turn deadly. <br>  My advice to you is to talk with the police for advice in the matter.  They see this kind of situation often. Chances are there is nothing you can do, as this was her choice and she fails to press charges. <br>  <br>  Was the death threat witnessed or documented in any way ?<br>  If so, there may be grounds to press charges. Inquire.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	my daughter kept going back to her abusive husband, but the thing that was the deciding factor that led her to leave him, was that the family finally told her not to call them anymore when she got beaten. they continue to beat, it never ends. sometimes they even get killed.|`|isA4wtnMaa	If he abused her once, he's likely to do so again.  Talk to her, she may be scared too.  Be open and understanding to what she says.

Whd6tqLzaa	You should find a place and time to sit down with him and ask him what went wrong in your marriage. There may be several reason for his recent acts. Unless you talk to him you'll never find out what is it bothering him. Some people don't open up, keep everything bottled up, which ultimately cause others to suffer.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Didn't he just make the ultimate commitment to you by marrying you?|`|TJezsCkHaa	Too early to think like that.Calm down and trust me,he committed to you because he loves you.Maybe something is up in his work that he doesn't want to bother you with.Relax and be yourself around him and show him how much you love him everyday more and more!|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	It's true.  If he wasn't ready, you shouldn't have pushed him!!!<br>  <br>  Now you have to wait and see if he comes around.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	baby marriage sucks|`|iD4ejChZaa	its a done deal, but give him space, not for clubbing or cheating, but make plans for yourself, go out with friends, show him you have other interests, be his friend, do not talk about babies, do not ask if he loves you, do not ask anything. don't hang on him, don't cry, don't whine, don't give him threats, don't badmouth his family or friends, just basically be a friend, let him meet you half way emotionally. give it time, don't go buying him gifts, don't remind him of happier times, just be cool, he sounds like he's suffocating, this is no time for long talks or drama.  let him see that marriage can be do-able. go to church yourself, Jesus saved me.
K3gqlxonaa	Power is the full answer. It is senseless and nothing to be involved in. Let them find a power ranger girl and you keep your real relationship and move on. Let that powetripper ttrip on by!|`|64oOqELCaa	yea it does the heart wants what the heart wants
8t0DlWf8aa	tell him your news.simple.tell him what you did the week before or if you have plants in the future for anything..|`|iufAPDeWaa	The conversation should flow without effort. I mean talk about whatever whenever. Just like you would start a conversation with a friend or family member. I know you don't put this much thought into talking to ya sis or bro do you? I doubt it. You're just nervous probably. But really it isn't a big deal. And another thing sometimes when theres silence its okay. No one wants to talk 24/7 anyway. :) Just relax and pick a topic and chat away. Think of something you talked to someone else about and had a good convo with recently. Talk about how out of wack the world is. Lol. And where you think our future is headed. People always have alot to say about that subject. GL|`|twVyisGnaa	Just talk about anything that comes to mind or about what's going on in life.  Maybe for you, you must be really shy.  I deal with the same thing when i hang out with my crush.  Talk about any problems that you might be going through or ask your boyfriend if he's dealing with anything major.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|xwG6e7IQaa	Maybe you should just stop right there then and just not be in a realtionship till you get some oral skills....I mean that's really important...oral communication....|`|C2sZREuAaa	Just ask him what his weekend plans are.    What is your dream job?

Conversations are not that difficult.|`|WPbwiGafaa	ask him wat he likes to do because that could start out a good conversation and also another thing wat type of music he likes|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	maybe you dont have much in common with him? :(    you could maybe watch a film together or something and then talk about it? make sure you are active when you see him, dont just sit in a room quietly together and expect it to go smoothly lol    get up, go out, do something together... and then discuss it and share views and opinions etc|`|DCe7GVJAaa	stay with the old reliable, always start out eith who,what. when.and where questions about him, that will get the ball  rolling.but dont stay on him in a forceful manner GET IT.goog luck.SHAWDI,|`|xnBnbYBgaa	talk about your interests. ask him if he likes a certain band, brand, food, store, style, politician.|`|7tLDdtqGaa	ask him about his day and job and what not|`|lohDhzRzaa	ask him how was his day...he will ask you how was yours then just start talking about anything...  talk about the two of ya|`|O0D9GtElaa	have a disscusion cause those can go n forever. like having conversations about your opinions|`|2c26d8fc94ce0e90f359f38553c9f608aa	If you two find it hard to talk, then HE'S NOT FOR YOU.

Then talk about his interests. After that talk about your interests. Exmp. "Have you seen the latest movie of Danny Boyle?" "Have you check out new AC/DC album?"|`|e3Jp26UZaa	Well being a guy i can tell you that we love a girl that can keep a conversation going whether its over the phone or text. A guy likes to see that the girl is interested in him or how his day went so ask him about his day, what he did, what he plans on doing, stuff like that. Just do your best to avoid those akward silent moments.|`|RQYUtwV0aa	yes i had the same thing except im a guy and to a girl just say something and hope that it'll break the ice like the first conversation i had was buses which didnt turn out very well lol so yea just think of some thing ask about hobbys and what you doing on the weekend and stuff.|`|LrUQiLLWaa	walk over and grab him by the shirt. jam your hand into his pants and say hey baby.     he will be shocked and pass out. when he wakes up he will want to have a conversation with you.|`|cEuFh0T8aa	only talk about things you like to do then if you run out of things to say  ask him what he is doing that week end and if he is not doing anything go someplace|`|0uXcT2j9aa	I'm guessing you're a young person (going by my teenage dating history), I think you should treat this relationship as a lesson to learn from for the time being and when you meet a great person (when your single of course) the conversation and everything else will flow naturally.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Just be your normal self and respond to his ideas, comments and feelings - the words will come automatically. Don't hold back anything - in love whatever comes to your mind - speak out - he won't mind or ridicule you. Best of luck.|`|u3FBa2zuaa	No, it's not sad, it's normal to be worried that if the flow of conversation stops then things are dull between you. Some people are very talkative and very creative with keeping the conversation flowing. I usually avoid talking about work or the weather or any mundane thing that most people talk about when faced with awkwardness. My husband is pretty dull unless I keep the conversation moving by asking him questions about things. People love to be asked questions about themselves, I find ways to keep things going by pretending to be interested in something that I'm not just so I can move the conversation around. Talking about one thing leads to another thing. Also, don't pick movies or music very often because it is a short lived conversation and pretty boring at that. I would ask him things about his childhood or always have a pen and paper handy to play little games when you're at dinner or something. Bring something to show him, or have something interesting planned to surprise him with. Also, being in situations of mystery or danger always spice up a relationship and cause conversation. Go to an amusement park or a haunted house or walk through a graveyard at night.  Ultimately though it is exhausting always having to be the one to create the conversation. Like I said, if I stop talking my husband will just fill the silence with stupid mouth noises or fidgety habits, I hate it. Men are sometimes so stupid and incapable of actually solving problems. But that is a different story.  Most importantly, let your boyfriend know that silence is alright sometimes. You should know that too. Sometimes I just want my husband to shut up but he constantly feels awkward if there is silence, he isn't smart enough to completely be quiet in the car or at dinner sometimes. This means that he is not comfortable with himself, it's just how he is. So if you feel like carrying the conversation do it, but if it becomes cumbersome then just make him uncomfortable by being quiet and show him how helpless he is, and if it weren't for you the two of you might have nothing to talk about.

7g8UHUJgaa	if you asked him if he liked her and he said no, then he is still single.    he could have told you yes, he is with her, but he did not.    so he must have wanted you to know he was single...unless all the girls asked him that question too.    but anyways, yes talk to him.    i had a similar or HAVE a similar situation.    i really care about a guy but this girl who i know is always with him.    everyone asked if they went out and he says no.     i talk to him online and whenever i see him, so it doesnot matter about the other girl.    just go for him. it will be okay and destiny will take its course.     :)

You could pipe 2 heads. One for you, one for him. They both can be low volume, so you are still conserving water. Both heads could be controlled with seperate hot/cold taps. If you want more hot water use a solar heater, they are simple to install, they will increase the amount of hot water availiable, and they decrease your electricity bills.|`|ivdpHmaxaa	stand next to each other.. u get in 1st, then your husband next while u brush your teeth. once u finish u go in and turn your shower to lukewarm. then u stand aside let your husband shower next wit hot water. u have to re-cycle yourself in the bathroom..|`|vRe6CwgEaa	My girlfriend and I had a similar situation.

I think she just THOUGHT she liked him and got bored with you . she's obviously confused.    and your brother seems like an *** i know you might think you hate him now but eventually he's saving you from a ****. but i honestly think he just wanted to compete with u.      xoxox   Shay |`|vrACGkKBaa	Yo dude look cut that ***** off but ur brother you can stay mad at him  for awhile but im sure you will laugh at this because you don't put no one before your family and he kinda just did you a favor he let you know that you cant and never could trust her.|`|lBvaknhmaa	THEY DIDNT DO ANYTHING TO YOU  YOU WALKED IN ON THEM  IS SHE HOT?
tCiVuFK9aa	She may be confused right now.  It is hard to carry on a long distance relationship and the stress of that may be taking its toll.  She may find herself attracted to you and feeling guilty about it because of the boyfriend at home.  Give her a little space.  Just stay friendly and don't mention anything more.  If she is questioning her relationship with the boyfriend, you want to let her settle that before anything can happen for you.  Red|`|h0rt6YJ4aa	every situation with a girl is confusing... right when you think you got her, she changes... you'll never get it, good luck though!|`|gqvvXknQaa	Sounds like it started out as harmless flirting, but she possibly felt more.

She'll come around when she's comfortable again.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	she probably isn't that smart and doesn't know how to say "I'm sorry I led you on and we can be friends?" like a normal person would|`|ba238a65527e07ede718daa63d8ae643aa	maybe cuz she still likes u, but is embaress about the fact that u knew she has a b/f. go talk 2 her whenever u get the chance, and eventually she wont ignore u, its a matter of time. sometimes u can misread the signs cuz a lot off ppl just stare, but it doesnt mean that they like u. there is a difference between infatuation & love. =]|`|aariLFAMaa	I don't think she really had interest in the first place. She was probably just curious to get to know you but didn't like you in that way. When you told her that you liked her that probably made her feel weird about your friendship with you. I had that happen to me when my guy friends tell me that they liked me or whatever and I didn't like that. It made our friendship all weird and it is a big turn off when a guy says that when you haven't even been going out yet.|`|i4bMNcmgaa	its kind of awkward think about it.. i mean sometimes girls give you the look iin away where they want to be your friends.. and ya.. it seems you got the wrong idea.. so like i would say she is avoiding you because it was kind of awakrad|`|QVjnAQ9waa	some girls develop crushes on random people but when  the person actually shows interest they get   scared and back way off.also she probably does   like you but feels really guilty for "cheating" on her   boyfriend.|`|BTYyj9jiaa	She may actually like you, or think your attractive, but she probably does love her boyfriend. When a girl is away from her boyfriend, and they are in the "love" phase, she wants to make sure nothing will come between them. Stay friends with her as much as you can. You never know, if they break up you can come in as the supportive friend.     Don't push her though, it will just scare her.|`|AAlB49iraa	Sounds like she likes you, and you probably got the signals right, but she still has this tie to her boyfriend. Problem is, he isn't there. Long distance relationships are difficult and especially so when you are away from home and probably lonely. Don't take it personally about her ignoring you. she is embarrased. She is  trying to play it off like "sorry you got the wrong impression" to protect herself from the embarrasement of almost crossing the line. relax...it will pass in a few days. ;)

aLgY4l3Naa	Well like they say "YOU WANT TO PLAY, YOU HAVE TO PAY" !!! Unfortunately you are going to have to deal with the consequences of your betrayal, trust is easily lost but hard to gain, and your really going to have to prove yourself trustworthy again before you partner can feel at ease in the relationship, but truly DON'T expect miracles, this is the worst thing you can ever do to a person and there are dire consequences to this action!! I think you both need to really sit down really communicate about how you can attempt to make this relationship work, but just know that there is going to more requiring of you then of him, so be prepared, if you want this relationship your going to do everything in your power to make it right!! Good luck to you and i hope things will work and you will make better choices in the future!!|`|AA12023355	I think the only thing that can help is couples therapy. If you're still together the love is there, just not the trust. You need to sort out your issues so you can move on and nurture this relationship.

The best thing it sounds like is to go your seperate ways. You have some growing up to do :) in the nnicest way. If later down the track you still love him then give it another go|`|x2bTvscWaa	hey im too young for this kind of thing, but i really think i have a good solution for this. u said u guys fight when you try to talk. I have that kind of thing, sort of , with my brother. All he wants to do is argue. SO, what you have to do, is call first. Call him, and tell him you love him. Even when he thinks of some smart mouth thing to say to retaliate, ignore it. just completely ignore his response if it is something that hurts your feelings. Once your over that, tell him you want to TALK, and this time if you begin to fight, you will both take a time out in the discussion and go to separate rooms. Once you are settled again, rejoin, and try to talk out what you just argued about. If u start to argue, it should only last for a few minutes, and if u think it will get out of hand and u will start to say things you on't mean, take a deep breath and walk away to the other room, when your calm, like i said, rejoin. This keeps the peace and maybe you will be able to finally talk things out and become closer. i hope this helps!!!|`|yNBQjSYkaa	from what i understand you guys have been fighting a lot, and both of you are pretty upset. The best thing you can do is understand that you made the mistake and he has a right to be upset. No matter what he is accusing you of, or how he is judging you, he is only doing it because he cant think straight. Don't be defensive, just let him get his emotions and and really make it clear you love him and you are really sorry for what you did, and that it would mean the world to you if you guys got back together. Either you have to make sacrifices to clear things up for you guys, or things will never get better.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	yer screwed. id leave you forever!!!!|`|7fdeTRhPaa	Oh aren't YOU a winner?
ze7xiJwTaa	She's an emotional trainwreck. She is looking for affection. If you act on it now she will more than likely despise you for it later, or at least regret it. Be there for her as a friend right now. Help her through her tough time. If it's still there for you later then your relationship will be much more solid and stand a chance (I'm assuming you want a relationship with her). Patience will be well worth the effort if she's important to you. Good luck :)|`|kANR98tIaa	You don't want to take advantage of her because she is in an emotional state? ARE YOU STUPID?!?!??!?!?!?<br>  <br>  look at that thing you just said man. Its like, "power turned off everything even the security cameras at a shopping mall, and you were like, Ill shoplift these clothes when the power is back so I can see" <br>  <br>  Shes in an emotional state! Use that advantage! Who knows! she might be ur wife....|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Depends on whether you are thinking with your brain or  with your other body parts.|`|ClK9W8THaa	I think it's nice that you can be there for her during this bad time in her life.  When lending good advice and support to someone who is under stress, pain, grief and mixed emotions.  You can only play one role. Your either a friend, or someone who is looking to take avantage at the wrong time.  It's easy to mistake someone's feelings when they are going through hard times.  And it's easy to release the wrong feelings when someone is going through hard times.<br>  Be very careful to what you say and do.  Because you are acountable for your actions.  When you ask " Should you take advantage of this woman".  Think about it , if it was your sister or mom?   How would you feel knowing that they turned to someone who could take advantage of them? And knowing that they were only going to be there for one thing and then leave.  She may be having a bad time right now because of her marraige..but what she really needs is someone or people around her who will give her the right support that she needs right now.  She could be talking to a marriage counslor that could help her make the right decisions in her life.  She may be hot right now... But she'll look ever better with a clearer head on her shoulders. And she'll appreciate you much better knowing that you didn't take advantage of her at that time.  She'll appreciate you knowing that you stood the test of being a true friend to her. So the answer to your question is  " no" you shouldn't take advantage of a friend in need of a friend in this most difficult time in her life.|`|8o7s9tynaa	Leave well alone for now, she's in too much of a mess to get involved with someone new. Be a good friend by all means, but don't complicate her life even more than it already is.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	Only you can decide,,,,,|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Get over her attractive appearance. Bottom line is she is Married !<br>  Careful about how much time is spent with her, as the more involved you become, the deeper you get yourself into her mess. Domestic issues are unpredictable.  <br>  <br>  Her appreciation for your support and friendship could very easily escalate into something more. You currently give her what she is missing in her relationship with her husband. <br>  <br>  Until the divorce is final and both parties have gone their separate ways, walk gently.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Do you really want to be the rebound guy for her? <br>  Practice patience and see what happens when she is in a more stable state of mind.
4SjwTCASaa	I think they are both really nice.  I think the biggest question you need to ask yourself would be, is he a pocket watch kind of guy? I personally like the first one (more modern), primarily because I'm not big on pocket watches (a little old fashioned).|`|bMifw33saa	the key ring|`|InZU5aaxaa	I would say the key ring. More likely to use it. Me and my husband didn't exchange gifts on the wedding day. He did however go out with his mom and buy a cheap simple wedding band for him. He then gave it to my MOH, my little sister, to give to me. I was kind of confused then realized it was for him. That was the best present ever since he would not have a wedding ring if he didn't go get it himself.|`|SDxI3YgXaa	pocket watch... its two in one!!! :D  hope i helped  CONGRATS ON THE BIG DAY!!!!!   hope your wedding is everything you dreamt of :)   OH! am i invited??? :P joke|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I like the first key chain better...    Maybe, along with that, you can pair it with his ALL TIME favorite candy, and other little pleasures that may release some stress for him (if you are giving it to him before the ceremony)...    Hope this helps!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I too was thinking about getting a pocket watch for a wedding present for my groom, but in conversation about something totally different the subject turned to pocket watches and so I asked him if he liked the look of one (fishing...) and he said he would never wear one as he doesnt see the point.  That idea went straight out of the window, I thought about a bracelet but he already has two, a chain with a cross on it (still mulling that idea around ) or just not bother. I am not certain he will get me anything so maybe I will just let it go.   The wedding is going to cost around 20,000 so I suppose there is no point to buying individual presents really.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Many men do not use a pocket watch. Out of the two choices you provided, I vote for the money clip.    I gave my husband a wristwatch and had something personal engraved on the back.  The one I gave him matches the style of his wedding band. He wears it every day so it always makes me feel special to see the watch on his wrist.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	key chain|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Spend more than $20 on your fiance.
49Ifnktsaa	dude!! of course!! look how many chicks are on this website asking bout help with some guy. lol..|`|6IjMSmhRaa	yeah that happens to girls too.
PAxR2gFdaa	Well, I think it depends.  <br>  I always use direct contact, no matter who I'm talking to.  Sometimes this includes passing people in the hallways.<br>  However, mostly I let the hallway eye-contact be reserved for the guy I like.  So... I think you have a pretty good chance.<br>  Go and talk to her!|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Mutual attraction|`|2c88J3M7aa	Haha I do that if I like the guy and think hes hot, and if he stares back at me then I get all happpy =)<br>  It means I'm checking the guy out<br>  Next time smile at her or something and slowly advance to saying hi and then maybe a conversation ;)|`|ixvzhoGUaa	It most likely means she finds you attractive & is interested to talk to you ! The next time you two make eye contact, casually say hi and smile. This will open up the door for the next time, maybe she'll be more comfortable to say something next =) also, if you happen to see her anywhere else other than the halls, give her a nice smile and if she's near you introduce yourself. good luck and i hope i helped !|`|At9zfB1Jaa	well it obviously means in that case that she's very attracted to u and she's not scared to show it|`|INLQHsl7aa	i do, to respect them while we were talkin.<br>  but in ur case i think she might like u, maybe u should ask her out sometimes...|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	it is normal|`|QgfiXYHKaa	personally, I'd rather look at the people I pass than at the ground lol.<br>  i like looking at the facial features, the eyes and their smile!!<br>  then I say hi or hello. he then responds, "how are you?"<br>  guys are great! very polite and sociable. ladies on the other hand sometimes won't even acknowledge you!<br>  I stick with looking at the handsome fellas ;)|`|Ad9bGAlNaa	Well, i kinda have the same problem. but i think it means she might like you.<br>  Because i used to like this guy and when we passed in the hallways i would look him in the eyes and we would hold each other's gaze until we passed. <br>  :) So yeah.|`|yZ9bSoyUaa	Either she is just being polite and acknowledging your presence or she thinks you are cute|`|6pXT4W0faa	I look into guys eyes because it's kind of <br>  the clostest thing you have to reading their mind, <br>  I guess.|`|CX0y66Puaa	It usually means "Oh i like you, read my mind and follow me" lolz well thats what i think anyway|`|XbxZR2nGaa	It means, "Please come to my place so we can have sex."
RPoFBenJaa	i think your mini vaca idea is great! Not only do you all get to "get away" it gives you time to wind down and relax instead of worrying about a party that might be stuffy and akward. Good idea!|`|rwdc6mLNaa	Why don't the 3 of y'all travel to where the last girl lives.  Get a vacation spot there in the area where she's never been before and live it up having a great safe time.  That way all will travel to a place where no one has gone before and it will still feel like a vacation. Make up your own getaway trip and play make believe. <br>  The Last Night To be a Little Girl.  Play the parts and don't come out of character until the next morning.  HAVE A GREAT TIME!  and Congratulations<br>  Love Always<br>  Aunt Tammy to all|`|7mtdqUpwaa	Thanks for answering my question. I like your idea, I love to travel a lot too and it sounds like fun especially when the other girls are accustomed to traveling too. Go for it. :)|`|29I8PWrxaa	I think the girls only vacation sounds like a great idea.  I'm having the same problem since my bridal party and both my fiance and my families live across Canada also.

bKfAte8aaa	Despite wanting to have this done are you ready for a fight with your father? And a fight possibly between your mother and father? I think you may want to wait till you're 18 and are able to do this legally yourself or when you're out of the house.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you're at risk for violence because of it then I sure as heck wouldn't do it while I was dependent on my parents.<br>  <br>  if you're living on your own and you're an adult then charge your dad with assault if he lays hands on you.<br>  <br>  heck, you should probably charge him even if you are a dependent.|`|apJ3t9k8aa	sounds like there is more an issue of abuse than permission. just do it and cut time with your dad.|`|ZyiVlnINaa	if ur mom as a guardian said yes, than u can do it...if ur afraid of a riped ear---dont.  depending on how often u see him u might be able to remove it around him, otherwise it might be safer to wait til ur a free adult.|`|hjtxRfQJaa	If you are under 18 you are screwed, its best you listen to daddy for now because he did it once he will do it again. Children must learn they have to abide by parents rules or suffer consequences.
JZK40k7Paa	if you are serious then there is a whole list of problems with the way you think.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Sounds very strange....I am an aquarius and I dont act like that but I think I know what the problem is.  Aquariuses are very fickle and funny especially while we are in the maturing learning and growing stages.  We are stuck in our ways unless we truly like/love someone then we become flexible.  One thing that I can say and believe me when I say this, is that when you do something to turn us off we are turned off!!! I dont know your history with him but if you did something to turn him off more than likely that was the reason for his vanishing act.  We move silently and dont like confrontation so unless the relationship is serious we make calculating decisions that are one sided.  Maybe you did something that you thought he doesnt know about, but guess again YES we are good at finding things out especially when we put an effort into wanting to know.  To explain the sudden appearance, it could be one of two things, he is conveniently using you for something he needs and he knows he can get or has gotten over whatever he found out because he misses you and wants to be with you.  Now everything I just said is about January aquariuses ONLY if he is a February aquarius more than likely his *** is crazy
5DJcir9saa	I did my reception two days after my actual wedding because we got married out of town and we wanted to be able to celebrate with all of our friends and family.  We were married on a Thursday and I wore my wedding dress and got pictures and all that.  Then we had a small get together afterwards where I changed into a party dress.  Two days later we had a reception back in the town where we live and everyone in the bridal party dressed back up and we did the reception as if the wedding had just happened.  We had the traditional dances and we didn't do a bouquet or garter toss but we did an anniversary dance instead.  Then the couple who had been married the longest was given a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine.  It was structured the exact same way as a "normal" reception would be.  As far as pictures go, instead of having to hire a photographer for both days, we just asked a few family members to go around and get lots of pictures throughout the reception.  That way we had the professional posed pictures from the day of the wedding as well as lots of different pictures taken throughout the night.|`|UT5HS39Daa	I did this exact same thing.  Except I got married on the beach, with just my husband and I, and we brought our bridesmaids and groomsmen (8 people) with us.  We sort of eloped.  When we got back I had a reception just as I would have if I would have just gotten married.  On the invitation I put "please join us for an evening to celebrate the marriage of blah blah.....").  I got a DJ to introduce my bridal party (who all had bouquets, and then to introduce us, and I had a garter and bouquet toss.  I carried all of this on just as if we had just gotten done getting married. :) I had a white dress, and my bridesmaids all wore their matching dresses, etc.  I don't think it's bad etiquette at all.  It's usually more fun for your guests, just to come and eat and dance, rather them have to sit through a loooongg ceremony, then have to go to a reception.  I still registered for gifts, but I didn't put it on my invitation to my wedding party, I just put it on my bridal shower invitations.  For the order of my ceremony I did: bridal party entrance, first dance, last dance with dad/mom, bridal party dance, eating, cutting of the cake, bouquet toss, garter toss, dancing, and then our last dance.  I think that was it? I didn't require my guests to dress up too much, I just put "cocktail attire", it was in July, so it was hot enough for the women to wear shorter dresses.    I hope I helped!! Congrats!!|`|pNrfE7fHaa	I am doing the same thing and no one I have talked to seems to have an issue with it!  My fiance and I are getting married on a cruise with close family and friends and then will have a reception about a month later for those who could not attend.    We will show pictures from the wedding and have food and stuff and just celebrate!  I don't think that people will have an issue with that.  I wanted that intimate time with just my close family and a couple of friends.  I didn't want the giant extravaganza.    It is your wedding.  Do what you want.  Too much these days wedding have turned from being fun for you and your groom to having to play politics as to not offend anyone.  I think if you are diplomatic about it, people will understand.|`|InZU5aaxaa	Congrats on the Wedding. I did the same thing at my wedding but a little different. I wanted a small close family only wedding ceremony and a big party style reception.     Wedding was on my moms front patio deck in the middle of the country with only about 20 guest at 12 pm. It was a very short ceremony about 15 minutes. Then we went in and my MOH, little sister, and others changed clothes. We then had a big pot luck barbeque lunch at 1 pm. Other guest arrived at this time. Everyone brought something so it helped with the cost of the wedding overall. We did the cake cutting and opened presents.    I would have the reception within a few days of the ceremony. Maybe wear a different more casual dress. I would do the cake cutting, dances, open presents. Everyone there will be expecting it. They will understand.|`|7VzbVzBnaa	I dont care how many people TD me and say they did it/will do it, in the US, this is simply not appropriate.      You get one chance.  If you can't make it work, then you miss out on that chance.     Have a party the next day.  But to structure it as a formal reception with a full gown, bouquet toss, and all the other reception stuff is inappropriate.      What people on this site tend to forget is that the reception is a party for your friends and family and it's supposed to  honor and thank them.  You getting all wedding'd out for THEIR party is pretty tacky.  It screams to me "pay attention to me", not "thank you for being a part of our lives".|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  You can structure this the same way you would any other reception.  Yes, you can have the traditional dances if you want.  But, those are never mandatory.  Yes, you can cut the cake, etc.    However, I would not do this too far after the ceremony (within a few weeks.)  Traditionally, a "reception" is right after the wedding.  But, I think many people are choosing to do this now so I don't think you need to get too caught up in etiquette rules.      So, have a dinner, a dance, all the "usuals" if you want.  Nothing wrong with that, in my opinion!  It sounds fun.    Good luck and congratulations!|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I would just throw a big party with toasts, cake, and a meal, with plenty of wedding photos scattered around for guests to see.    I wouldn't bother with the white dress and the dancing, but that's just me.     There's nothing wrong with a private ceremony and a big reception later. What would be rude is having a wedding "do over" because the couple feels they didn't get enough presents or enough attention the first time around. That doesn't sound like you.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	My  husband and I got married in a very small ceremony (just us) on the beach in December and will be having a "barbeque in celebration" at a park in March. We too don't want presents (you also shouldn't ask for them unless the guests went to the wedding) so we're wording it as more of just a casual get-together in celebration and not a "reception."  That way, people don't feel pressured about gifts or the formalities of "normal" receptions.     You can do dancing (but probably not traditional wedding dances), music, cake, etc if you want. There are no rules :) we're going to be having a wedding cake at our bbq because I really want a cake! We're going to supply the food but it's all going to be very informal so it won't be a huge expense.    The main reason we're having it at a park is to keep the "informal" feel to it, have somewhere for kids to play around, and just have a good time without having to worry about decorating (or pay for) a huge reception venue.    Good luck with both! I think wedding ceremonies should be whatever the two of you want and if you want it to be very small, then have it very small!    My cousin had a reception a few months after the wedding and they wound up doing karaoke at the party, it was pretty funny :)|`|7CKipTZOaa	We are planning the same thing. We are planning for it to be 2 evenings after the ceremony I think it is great. We are going to be videotaping the service and then the reception guests will watch it then we'll be announced, we are having a social hour then preceding to do the traditional dances. I don't miss the garter or boquet toss to be honest. One idea I like is we'll be able to share some photos already and incoporate them into the decor    We will be having the cake at the reception as we are hosting it later in the evening well after supper hours    Congratulations and I think its great !|`|AkUhaMm9aa	just have a party, maybe at a restaurant..depending on how many people you are inviting..no need to dress up again..just wear something formal..party dress..and make it  fun...|`|AA10975867	Many cultures have the reception the next day! Where we live, a lot of East Indian families have a traditional ceremony and dinner on a Friday and then a huge hoopla the next night. It works very well. Some couples get married in a small chapel or home exactly for your reasons, maybe to accomodate an elderly parent or grandparent, and then the next day or the next weekend have a big wedding reception. Yes, the bride wears her gown and veil and at that reception the cake is cut and the bouquet/garter thrown. Nothing wrong with that at all and if people are close enough to be invited, they shuold be close enough to know about granny's condition and your thoughtfulness. You can send out invitations as normal and can word them " You are invited to a wedding reception for ..... on ........ at 7 pm following a small family ceremony." This is NOT tacky or rude if it is all done on the same day or weekend or very close to the day. People will telephone and word will get out. Your family should be instructed to simply say "You know how close Susan is to her grandma! This was the best way she could be sure that Grannie June could attend safely. "|`|itbkP9HGaa	It would be strange if you dressed back up in your wedding gown, so i'd advise having it be a celebration of your marriage.  Maybe you can do it after your honeymoon?  Skip the dances and other typical wedding reception things, it would just seem odd when not preceded by a wedding ceremony.  I'm not sure how big you want it to be, but you could do a sit-down meal, DJ, bar, etc and just have it be an awesome party to celebrate your marriage.  Or you could to a buffet-style luncheon.  However you want is fine!|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I am a wedding planner,and I can tell you this is actually becoming more and more popular. You can do whatever you want. Normally you still have the traditional dances and you can still do the boquet and garder toss if you would like, but don't have to. You can also do a reaffirmation of vows at dinner, just very quick if you want everyone to be involved but again don't have to. You really can do what you want, but I always say if you want traditional go for it, if you don't then do it your way. You only get this day once (hopefully). Enjoy it|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	ah!  we are doing the same thing!  i will tell you how we are doing it...maybe you'll like the suggestion!    we are having the ceremony video taped...a little expensive, but we can't have the whole family together due to fueds (we are actually having 3 receptions...long story).  anyway, of course everyone is hurt that they can't be there, so we are going to do EVERYTHING the same as though they were there.  we are going to show the video and still do the cake and dances and toast so that everyone can get all the pictures they want and i won't miss out on any of it either!    we are considering starting with a cocktail hour/meet and greet type thing...then slip off and change into our dress/suit and have someone else man the video.  as we are walking off the screen of the video, the DJ will start our song and we will enter in our wedding attire and begin our first dance.  afterward we thank everyone for coming and tell em all to eat! :)    i really hope this works out for you! :)|`|QikvnTnqaa	You can still toss a bouquet toss?!?! Why couldn't you?!?! It's YOUR reception (and wedding). Why not? No one is going to say no!     I think it's great that you are including his grandmother.  You can have traditional dances, no-traditional, anything. You can do ANYTHING that you would do if it was the "standard" way. No one will mind. It will make it more fun (if that's what you want to do).    Do whatever YOU want. Don't worry about what others will think. :)|`|LVNbP6VWaa	I would do everything exactly the same and wear the dress again too.  Do the dances and the bouquet toss (uness you do that at the wedding) and have your cake etc.  Don't miss out on anything just because it is a different day.     It would be nice to have a slideshow of your wedding photos if different people will be at the reception.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Moving so fast, yeah but being and making something gross sure not, i mean just dont let him do it in a weird environment, i mean when there r kids or seniors they might feel out of place, or u might feel that as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|wqchA8B7aa	It's gross and demeaning if he does it in public. In private, if you're comfortable with it, then who cares?|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	You're dealing with a guy who's being controlled by hormones.  Could be good if you just want experience, etc.  But, if you have morals or a deep desire for something more serious then I'd pull the plug.  You seem uncomfortable about this...  From my experiences this isn't something that will go away, even if the guy apologizes and swears off the behavior.  He'll quit for a week and be at it again.  Haha, I'm talking from experience here...|`|Ub1IOPsraa	This sounds like a question for singles and dating.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	Yes, you are moving too fast. he needs to respect you more.|`|PlHjhwtAaa	if you have to ask then yes.<br>  <br>  he sounds like a perv|`|DTZmqnCkaa	If you enjoy it and are flattered, then it's not too fast.  If it bothers you, then it's too fast.  It sounds like it's the doing it in front of other people that bothers you.  Just tell him how you feel.
jUWOMgyuaa	That happened to me  I was honest with him, and told him when I'm done, I'll let him know  He was understanding (:|`|qpt51YeAaa	if you're not sexually active yet, then just tell him you're not ready yet  cause you're obviously not. hahha  he's not gonna be grossed out, he probably makes fun of girls having periods with his friends all the time. at least my boyfriends did.  lol  and if you're really worried about telling him, then maybe you should just wait to see if he tries to do anything sexual with you and then be like "honey, im sorry, but i cant right now" and then he'll be like "oh" and then he'll turn on the tv  hahaha it's really no biggie|`|mv34vUTnaa	if he is your boyf and love you he wil not be grossed out at all..  jus be honest..and if he starts being stupid mayb he is not right for you  x|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Tell him and stop. If he is "grossed out" then you should wonder why. If he is "grossed out" chances are all he wanted was sex anyway and you would be best to steer clear.|`|mVM44fKgaa	tell him. If he's cool with it then go for it. If not, then wait a week. Use protection and lube!|`|T93PeFvFaa	Be honest with your boyfriend, if he really loves you and understood the girls body and whats they go through he wouldn't mind, tell him to wait or go slow.|`|5Djrx9fTaa	There's a saying that if you're hesitant at all you shouldn't do it. If feel that yu should know when you are ready and not have to ask others what you should do and follow your own heart. If you plan to just be careful with portection.
4oDn5zIpaa	acutally i am in 8th grade and have the same problem my friends have kinda pulled away. The thing is in junior high or even high school girls try so hard to find there spot and they want that spot to be the top. Most girls will do anything to be popular even loose there best friend. I do not talk to my mom about it but it really bothers me. The main thing for you to do is to kinda keep her mind off of it go shopping with her or something like that, but dont spend 24/7 with her. Also she will want to talk about it but make sure it is on her time. Do not push her! I know it doesnt really sound like you are pushing her to much but make sure you do not bring it up alot. Also if her friends are picking on her only go to the school or their parents as a last resort it will just make her friends not like her even more trust me. Also help her feel confident let her get her hair cut cute and get her nails done and get her the pair of jeans she has been wanting or the top she wants or even the shoes. Any confidence boost is great. Eventually it will stop and she will find her place and her friends but it will take time. She may sit alone at lunch and stuff for maybe even a year and it will suck but it will get better and she will get through it tell her you love her and are here for her to talk to but dont act to much like a mom. lol that means laugh out loud     I hope it helps|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	Teenagers have mood swings, some more than others, so much of her behavior is normal.  You may be making more of an issue then it is right now...hard to say.    Has she ever invited a friend or her group of friends for a "sleep over?"  Take her to a beauty salon for a makeover or something or buy a new outfit for her (shoes, purse, suit) that she can feel really special in.     If you can turn the focus on to her a bit that might get her friends attention.      If she were my child I would sign her up for gymnastics or dance classes.  Hopefully she will make some new friends because the change would do her good.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	This is a hard one, not being there. 4000 words verses 500. Something serious happened. I wonder if the group was involved in something that your daughter did not take a part in. She was banished from the group because of her stance. Most kids won't talk. They bury it within themselves. If there is one of the girls that is still friends with her, then this same girl is probably in the outs with the group the same as your daughter. Since everyone still talks to your daughter, they know that she is keeping their secret...happy with that fact....but yet, in private is still shunning her. Over the top with this you say? I don't think so myself, but could be|`|y2nC8BUGaa	you didn't mention how old your daughter is.  I'm guessing middle school (junior high)?  If so this is completely normal.  That age is extremely difficult for girls and the ones that do not have obnoxiously in your face attitudes get shoved aside.  I went through the same thing.  My friends all abandoned me for no reason and some actually started hitting, kicking, and mocking me in front of our classes.  My mother didn't believe me because not one of them seemed like that kind of person.  When we got to high school they all acted like it never happened and by that time I had made new friends with the other girls who had been shoved aside.    Get her involved in an activity outside of her school where she can meet new people.  chances are there will be a lot of other girls with the same problem there.    P.S. All of the friends that were physically abusive to me at the time were very nice to me in front of our parents.|`|vrACGkKBaa	yo tell your kid that its fine not having friends and whenever she realizes that then she will notice slowly that people will come to you just try being the quiet one for awhile. if that doesn't work im a 19 year old female who loves to chat so if she is ever going through anything at school then she could always get on the computer and go to face book and we can chat there. That's if she wants to.
3hBQz33Yaa	make it a point to talk to him again to show him your not snotty play it cool. more than likely he wont seem upset and if he thought you were snotty or rude will possibly start to think different. dont ignore him because if you do then he might actually begin to think that or he could be in to you and start to think your not in to him and give up.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Just let it go things like this happen all the time! If it's really getting to you then you should tell him that you were busy that night otherwise you would've talked with him for a little bit. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Just go back over to him apologize for the way you acted you didn't know what came over you, and ask him what he thinks about you and if he wants to go out sometime.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	it all come to how he took that. some guys would have say that you<br>  were rude and think that you are better than anybody. the next time<br>  talk to him make the first move.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	Next time you see him just work up the courage and smile and then say "Hey! How are you?" then smile again. Just be casual.|`|5zu7AdlKaa	next time u see him ask him out for coffee|`|Qnswjc6kaa	You didn't mess up! If anything, that could be seen as playing hard to get. Give him some eye contact (meaningful eye contact), them dart away. If you're just plain up front and nice he might just mistake any attention you give him for platonic friendliness. Granted, if you're not into sexy mind games, don't do it again, but if you are...|`|EmBsBvJJaa	aw dont worry.i make myself look like a fool in front of guys all the time.you r so not alone.just from now on, either YOU start the convo OR wen he says something, do wut you wished you did wen you messed up.|`|UWx1beYtaa	Just don't ruin the next chance you have to talk to him again.|`|AZ4Wjxjgaa	mabe a bit stalkerishh??|`|0s3QjkuBaa	1. talk to him<br>  2. make plans/date<br>  3. answer my question<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219195721AASoKGj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  do these and u will have a guy on ur side.
HceG7kfyaa	tell him....if you are scared that it is too soon in the relationship just be sure to SHOW him. words speak louder than actions. you should also think about how you feel about him and rather than saying "i love you" say other things that would be able to show him how much he means to you. give it time....when you feel ready to say it...just say it.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Tell him how much you care about him just without using the words I love you. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|BZwJeuMGaa	if you love him just tell him.... dont play games|`|SWptQpfpaa	FLIRT FLIRT FLIRT!!!! lol<br>  <br>  answer mine??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqGILli8yF5eCehpElpt7G3ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219195427AAr8o0b">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6lYFSKKTaa	write a romantic poem/letter.|`|GqJVk2kYaa	Take a dump on his chest.|`|XbxZR2nGaa	Make love...<br>  Or write it on a card.<br>  Either one... you choose.
oRzqWhsDaa	both of you need counseling so you could talk to her without her interrupting then she would have to listen to you there is nothing wrong with you|`|I2gs5opxaa	yess ok
FIRpiVYVaa	I think the best thing to do....is let him go. Either that or confront him about how you feel. If you want to make amends with this guy. then you should confront him and tell him that you don't like what he's become, and you don't like how he acts now, stuff like that. But if you're in a situation like me, then it's better to let go. There was a guy I knew in 8th grade, and we were pretty good friends, I would stay over at his house for the night (of course I would say him and his sister would ask if I could come over). about early last April, me and his sister started talking more, and she told me about the real **** that goes on, what he does to her, and what their mom does to her. Plus we are also huge LOTR fans. But over the summer we really got to be amazing friends, almost like sisters. but her brother became a complete a$$hole to me. He started saying **** behind my back, calling me gay, and all that crud. But...I really missed him...and I wanted to be friends with him again, so I tried. and it worked for a little while, Till a bunch of my friends started a random conversation about if we could kill someone who would we kill (don't ask I don't know how that started) but I said my friends mom, and one of my other friends said "I bet *such and such* would agree with you" I said "I bet not, and I can prove it" I walked over to my friend's brother and I said "Who do you like better your mom or your dad?" and he said his mom. then I walked away. Since then things have only gotten worse. this past week.....I felt that pain of missing him again. When  I rememberd how much fun we used to have. Then I decided, he was dead to me. I said I will remember him in my mind the way I liked him, not the way he is. <br>  <br>  Just let go if it doesn't work out, Sorry it's so long|`|WQhV4Amgaa	why did you have to call sherlock holmes to answer this? TALK TO HIM! you have to give him reasons to stop smoking pot. cry in front of him. show him how much he means. if he really wants to be your ANYTHING he'll change. if not.... i'm sorry... i'll hold you while you cry it off
EZ1cPPvkaa	Don't be discouraged, monogamy still exists.  There are plenty of people who have led a completely faithful life together, i'm sure of it.  <br>  However, people do cheat, all the time.  Your question is kind of a tricky one because anybody who cheats has a reason, whether that reason comes from themselves or the person they're with, or something else.  I mean, yeah, I guess even a person who has the perfect spouse or partner, loves them very much, and has no desire for another person may still cheat.  Sometimes the reason for cheating has more to do with the person cheating than anything else.|`|0b11b20ed56b2c5daa5faaaafc60ce88aa	i belive there is but then again im a romantic
p8RvGtNYaa	It was clear why you married him: a meal ticket and the green card.  Don't know what you were expecting.|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Believe it or not that is all you know of a comfort zone. It is hard to face change because change is strange to us. But if you are truly unhappy and in an unhealthy relationship then work passed the hard part of the change and you will physically feel a weight lifted from your shoulders!|`|Whd6tqLzaa	You have to talk to him. If there is no communication between you two and there is no way you can talk to him, then there is a major problem between you two. I don't think begging for attention or talking too much will soften his heart. You have to concentrate on your studies, plan for your future instead of depending on him. Since he is paying for the day care, you can find a part time job. Try talking to him instead of singing, dancing or begging.|`|nwBsEzUlaa	If you divorce him, he will have to pay child support and possibly alimony. You can use that for the nursery..  Also you can apply for citizenship (although, if your kids were born here then they are natural citizens) and if you can prove that your ex hubby  is mentally abusive or Worse (maybe tape him while he is putting you down or complaining unreasonably) then no judge will grant him full custody.And since you are their mother and have applied legally for citizenship and have a previous marriage performed in the u.s (i am assuming) then you won't be deported. Also if he ever puts his hands on you, you can charge him with domestic violence and file an injunction. He'd then be forced to leave the house and you'd end up being able to keep that too..|`|lfMJPZ67aa	You can't spend another three years on some-one that doesn't love you. There is always help you just need to look into it more. Also you need to decide if you want to stay in the US. Where do you come from?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i read you tall... just pack your bags .. and see a lawyer now .. he wil have to pay for it .. dont worry about him as he wont worry about you..
d20mM90uaa	who cares, both of you are sinners either way, so have fun with it,lol|`|fHfVRcqbaa	It's not a double standard.  They are both trash in my book.

But you can't help it. We have to grow-up and understand relationships and differentiate between cheating and friendship. Also if both the partners are comfortable - let people say what they want - who cares. Best of luck.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I know what you mean. Its really not fair. I hate it too, but there's really not much you can do to change it. Its life.|`|oTPcaQ0Maa	Because way  way way back when.. men use to be able to be man whores and it was perfectly acceptable and women had to stay home and cook and clean and give it up whenever there man wanted...now its both equally the same... and people are just stuck with certain morals of the past. Its kind of like how women lately have just now been seen as good as a power role...like being an executive at a job, back then you would of NEVER seen that.. it wasn't ok. But now more and more people are getting used to the idea but some still think that women in power positions are not ok. All the new babies wont have this mind frame since it will fade itself out.|`|925b8594ae5633969b8af717d31ecb54aa	Married men who have affairs with married women are called many names.  They are not looked upon highly as you suggest.  Women call the married woman who cheated with a married man names because women blame the woman for destroying the marriage. There is supposed to be like code of ethics that you don't mess with a married man.  You destroy his marriage and his family.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	It is because men can usually keep it as a sexual thing and can even go on for years with both people's marriages staying intact.    On the other hand, woman tend to become emotionally involved which ends up destroying both marriages.
dZtToTIbaa	I think that would be fine.  Things like that are just simply "tradition" but its your wedding so that means you can do whatever you like!  If you don't feel comfortable having one then don't.  No biggie.  Congratulations!|`|4UUVrWXtaa	No, is not weird or unusual at all..<br>  You are more than welcome to do you everything you want and can for your wedding day!

You dont have to have them sit with you at dinner, but I think if they are doing the honor of being your witness, that they should be included in the ceremony, other then that, the choice is all yours, and I think its fine to not want a huge wedding party|`|rzPIO1aQaa	We were going to have a bridesmaid and a best man but when I asked her she was all for it and said she would pay for her own dress and now its I need to pay for it but I need to wait till she has time to go get sized and so on. The best man can't afford his attire either so we chose for it to be just me and him. My oldest son will stand beside him he will be the best man and it will be just me which I am fine with. I say have the wedding the way you choose and be happy about it. Your wedding can be anyway you want it. it is what makes you guys happy.|`|n3Agaj6naa	I think thats fine.<br>  We were having trouble too, but it was really important to find some girls for me to share the time with leading up to the wedding.  I chose my 3 cousins. <br>  My fiance just doesn't have any close guy friends.  He didn't want me to have any attendants, I basically said too bad.  I'd like him to find at least 1, to help us out with planning, and keep our heads together.  In the end he's chosen 2, but he's she about asking them.<br>  <br>  In the end it's really up to you, the only reason you would need a bridal party would be to help out with wedding related things, and to enjoy some time with.  Personally I think the events leading up to and process of planning a wedding are just as fun as the day itself, which is why it was so important to my to have a few BMs.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i dont think its weird if its your second marriage or if you are a lot older... why not just a brother or a cousin? some one has to sign anyways as a witness. i dont think its weird but i wouldnt do it.|`|7mtdqUpwaa	No that's not crazy. I think its fine. People do what works for them, a lot of people don't follow the wedding traditions. Its your day, do what you want.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	No thats fine i think, its different but its up to you.<br>  Dont let anyone crush you dreams of having it.<br>  <br>  yes it is different but there is nothing wrong with it, its what you want!!!!|`|Sdy2G97daa	it would be weirder to have a wedding party with no wedding.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	nope, not weird at all.  My cousin only had a MOH and a Best Man at her wedding.  (they had a really ticky priest who refused to allow anyone who was not Catholic to participate in the wedding and they wound up using relatives to fill in for the necessary spots for witnesses.  It was bad, the way the priest was going we thought he wasn't going to allow anyone who wasn't Catholic in the church for the wedding.)|`|weBvwrloaa	weddings can be customized now.You dont have to follow traditions.

For instance, you might be involved in an accident and your face is ripped off.  Or perhaps a crazy chimpanzee attacks you, rips your ears off, then beats your face to a pulp.  <br>  <br>  This girl cannot control the way her face looks.  You CAN control what you say.  Why are you so negative?|`|gYT1zAZqaa	You are aufull. People can't help how they look. And if you make fun of people then it makes you look like an ugly person. You should be ashamed of your self. I think you are dealing with some ishuse from your past. Mabe you wer bullyed when you were younger. You need to get some counceling.|`|lTS9ggOhaa	You are really immature and have an inferiority complex.  You are being cruel to someone who you have no right to judge.  Be ready, because you are about ready to find out what "karma" really is.  For every action in life, there is a reaction, which comes right back to you.  Let me explain it this way.  Do you believe in God?  Well, whether you do or not is irrelevant because you are about to find out the hard way what happens to bullies who go around harming innocent people.  I feel sorry for you.  You are just beginning a life of nightmares and what my grandmother would've told you that you were going to go to purgatory, which is halfway to hell.  You have an ugly evil spirit which is worse than anyone's exterior looks.  That girl is probably a beautiful girl who will turn into a beautiful woman because God will protect her from evil bullies like you.  You need counseling and a good whipping and some help for your mental problems.  Your parents are doing a horrible job at raising you.  You are nothing short of ignorant.

If he really loved you he would help you get through it.|`|AA12022610	i bet he got scared|`|9RtdvLEKaa	Clearly, he's freaking out just as much as you are, the only problem is that he has the choice to just turn tail and run and you don't.  You *could* get an abortion but I wouldn't recommend that.  It's not as easy as going into the doctor and getting it done and leaving.  You're going to have to live with it forever.  And, if he's not ready to be a father, it's better that he's not in your life because you don't want someone that's incapable of being there around your child.  Talk to your mom and your family will help you through it.  He may just need some time to think it over and will come back when he comes to his senses.  Like I said, talk to your mom and let her help you figure things out.  Good luck, hun.  Stick in there and be strong.|`|vTra7n5baa	You're not specific enough.  How old are both of you?

I could understand if it's not his but if it is that is really shitty. You need to start getting some support from your family because the next nine months is going to be rocky, especially if you are a teenager, but it is POSSIBLE. I'm a labor and delivery nurse, I see this all the time. You can have a baby without a man, you just need more support. Perhaps you should look into adoption if you can't provide for the baby and feel like you are not ready.|`|SDMqpoFXaa	If it wasn't his kid, then he doesn't want to raise someone else's kid.<br>  <br>  If it is his kid, he's afraid of raising a kid at his age and doesn't want the child to hold him back from whatever potential prospects may be out there for him. Raising a child is a lot of work, and he obviously isn't ready for the responsibility. I'm afraid to say that now you know your boyfriend's true colors.|`|UWx1beYtaa	He may be scared. Give him some time, guys find it harder to cope than females do.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't come round to it after a few months then tell him your going to slap child support on his a**.<br>  <br>  P.S. If he isnt' there for the whole pregnancy or when the baby is born then you or your child don't need someone like that in your life.|`|0qGSwNswaa	Well either he doesn't want to take responsibility for your child, or he may even be scared.

He doesnt want the responsiblity of another humans life apparently meaning he isnt fully mature yet and cant even take care of himself..|`|b89BxLMoaa	Commitment issues.  Obviously.  He's not ready and he's no good if he'd leave you for that.  Unless the child isn't his....|`|iIxNYyjoaa	msg me and ill give you some advice!<br>  my  best friend is pregnant as well and the guy left her and she is 13 he was 19?<br>  but anyway how old are you?|`|tSK3eFGpaa	-it could b due 2 the fact if the baby wasnt his......|`|MqxXoAZbaa	he's just scared. its a normal reaction. iv been in his shoes its very scary....BUT he cant ACTUALLY go anywhere i mean you have his child lol there is no getting around that.|`|HSXspcPTaa	maybe cuz he didnt want to take the responsibility, or he didnt like that you werent a virgin?|`|Codtw9mlaa	i would get an abortion|`|WTvOHjXmaa	prolly cause your a whore!!     yea?|`|yo6OTEXnaa	ur blonde...<br>  no wonder..<br>  prob from a diff guy|`|WuyvNWQsaa	He probably didn't want to deal with the responsibility of a child. (and yes you spelled pregnant right.)|`|oRzqWhsDaa	hes a jerk and make sure he pays child support when you have your little one|`|50zbKv0jaa	simple <br>  you are there for sex<br>  not to be the mother of his child<br>  why would he want to be a father?<br>  why would he want a family<br>  so much ***** he hasn't slept with, seems a waste to settle down<br>  <br>  have an abortion and move on, be quick before the hormones ruin your breasts
Zjgmm9t5aa	blah blah blah  let me take a peek at it|`|ijR3ygAJaa	What makes you think she is at all interested in you? o.o I know if I were here, I wouldn't be! She has a BOYFRIEND! Your BEST FRIEND! Does that mean anything to you? Unless you want to screw everything up, leave them both alone.|`|GCpnuPNCaa	lol i agree with the girl that said what makes you think shes intrested in you. i mean why would he be lieing or are you trying to prove that your better than him.|`|7aoHmM4baa	looooooooooool<br>  well i ll say <br>  that i haven t been able to like neither of them|`|R3Qe2zSbaa	funny question. but ya its wrong that you would do that to your friend and it matters what a guy does with his whole body, not his size. trust me, my guy may not be as big as other guys ive been with, but he is by far the best. so you and your ego could most definetly be wrong.|`|Qnswjc6kaa	Do you actually want the girl, or do you just want to be nice and show her better sex?<br>  <br>  I suppose it is the motion of the ocean, but if your boat is tiny all the waves in the world aren't going to save it.|`|niBPwo0naa	You need to move on to another woman, if she is happy with her boyfriend let her be.  Don't get your friend upset with you for some average looking girl.  Girls come and go.  Good friends are hard to come by.|`|AZ4Wjxjgaa	Theyre happy. Leave them alone. <br>  <br>  and its the motion of the ocean.|`|KUhZX3Hbaa	It's the W  I   D   T   H   of the boat and the length of your tongue.|`|XbxZR2nGaa	motion of the ocean|`|HtHFHfDKaa	When it is at the expense of your best friend yes. It is the size.|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	i wouldn't necessarily say it's wrong to think it... act upon it, yes, that's bad, but your just confident. <br>  <br>  and no, it's not the size of the boat, just the motion of the ocean ! :D
RnWValdTaa	ok so y dont u guys try intense 69. lay him down and lay on him the opposit way and ride his tongue into extasy haha or trying teasing pleasure. like letting him xtittyfuckx while you play with his head with your tongue. for you let him spank your xclitx with his xdickx and just rubing it on there. you sound like you need a lil more kick in your xsexx life so i recommend playing some games like getting xsexx dice or cards. randomly pick a card and use that position while you xfuckx dont be afraid to get just a lil kinky (handcuffs, whipes, paddles, and roleplaying). lastly i recommend getting a karma sutra book start at the beginning and xfuckx your way through it. and make up your own moves and positions(the xpussyx is a powerful tool) good luck|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	That happened to me too. Try learning new tricks like twisting your head from one side to the other when you go down. Make it a game for you. It makes it fun for you... and the pleasure meter goes up for him.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Sounds like you are bored with each other, move on to someone else.|`|lNGGCEYtaa	Uh Oh........... sex is getting boring, this relationship is doomed|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Try kinky things like flavourd lube... chocolate sauce and things :)   And i've geven oral sex before but now i refuse unless i get oral sex first.. good rule to go by :)|`|Bnj2ftpzaa	Don't make it such a "job" so to speak! Have fun with it. Do it for a while, then just tease him a bit, then do it some more, then tease a bit more... get him really worked up and it won't seem so tedious. And you'll enjoy it more too. ;-)|`|mVM44fKgaa	69.
7gH7sgi6aa	Unfortunately if the Son is using the computer in the Mother's house there is not a thing he can do about it.  If he wants to look at porn then he will have to use a computer that isn't at his Mothers house.

If you're not comfortable with it, and are scared (and with good reason!) that he's going to get in trouble looking stuff up...<br>  those sites can not only ruin your computer by putting viruses on it, but can also steal your personal information, and rack up huge charges for you. Not to mention, if he looks up something unknowingly illegal, he could get in trouble.<br>  Also, it can get addictive (seriously, this is a psychological fact), and make a young man have an unrealistic view of what a woman is suposed to look like...and do!

I would.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	If your son is on his own computer then it is very wrong to interfere.  If he is on the family computer then that is a whole different story.  If he is sharing it with other adults then he needs to be considerate and respectful.  If he is on his own computer although you may not like it he is an adult and meddling would not only be wrong but intrusive.  It is the perfect way to drive him off.  As for some sites being linked to kiddie porn I don't know because I am a 53 y/o woman and aren't into any kind of porn.|`|jBIaUfUzaa	with the internet anythingis possible ... it is your home if you dont want your son lloking at such material online in your home on your comupter then you have every right to block it ! an if he doesnt like it tell him to buy his own lap top , but until then in your home that is not eccepted ... i block pornography from my boyfriend i live with its my computer i pay for the internet so i block him from porn on the computer|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	it is absolutely true and majorly expensive.|`|7EcoKxhlaa	If you are against it, listen to your heart on the matter. Research the statistics around addiction to pornography and other pitfalls related to it. Share the info or email it to your son and let him know you care. Just because something is a norm in society does not make it healthy. And like the others said if you are paying for the service you are in control. And you are probably also liable for what goes on in your home. I wish you well! ~ Shell|`|AA11680669	Yepp it's normal<br>  <br>  If it's on a shared pc then get him to get his own, as for illegal content he's 19 he should know the difference between right and wrong.<br>  <br>  I would let him get on with it if it doesn't interfere with you or other members of the family. As for checking yes your his parent but however he is now 19 and should not need some moral guardian to oversee his adulthood.<br>  <br>  This is made in the assumption that he is mature enough to look after his own affairs.|`|94TPwojgaa	The remedy is to tell him why it is beneficial to avoid porn.

I was devestated. I'm sorry that happened to you. I would probably still cry now. lol So, no you're not wierd.|`|fV2RBwIJaa	I did when I was little. It was devastating losing a balloon.

If your subconscious is stressed, your body will release it too. The balloon could have been the last straw.<br>  <br>  OR, when you cry when you loose something special, especially something comforting from your past- you could be grieving over the loss of your childhood and it's catching up to you physically and subconsciously.<br>  <br>  Deep.|`|LlzJLyiUaa	I have... but I was 4 at the time.|`|H4bYFqwPaa	awww so sad.|`|qU8HqQsOaa	I did 1nce I was younger though.who gav u it? depends on tat if ur bf/gf gav it than y not cry?
Wf8PbTraaa	i think the simpliest thing to do is just sit them down and give them reasons why you should get your own room.<br>  <br>  it'll really help if your a teenager cuz all parents know teenagers need a bit of privacy|`|AORcLwTNaa	say u need privacy!|`|xbISxnmfaa	Tell them your getting older and you need your space and privacy, This will only work when your if you in high school.|`|NFpKeEXZaa	ask them if you just can, i take it even if you are a tweenie or teenager you should have your own room. Sharing a five year old is fine.....if your FOUR! it is not ok that you have yo share a room with a much younger person. But if you will have to share a room with a teenager such as a sister it will be much harder than sharing with a small child (trust me, been there)|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you will never know till you ask.  just say, can i have my own room.  they will either say yes or no.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Try this, "Mom and dad, what do you think of the idea of me having my own space?".....cheers|`|mMi19s7Vaa	Just ask =]<br>  <br>  such as....<br>  mom and dad can i have my own room plz?|`|hnN1ibklaa	Present your case in a mature way.<br>  Tell them how you feel, and why you should get what you want.<br>  Do not say "this is so unfair!" or "all of my other friends have their own room!!" <br>  be reasonable.<br>  No matter what they say, at the end say "Thank you very much for listening to my argument." and give them a hug.<br>  Be willing to negotiate. Maybe you can make an agreement that you move into your new room in a few months.<br>  tell them you know its a big responsibility, but you feel your ready to  take on the opportunity.|`|0F3CSaJUaa	Tell you're parents that you are growing up and as a growing young woman you need to have your privacy. Sharing it with a sister is one thing but a brother... Promise them that you'll keep it clean and offer to help set up a new room for your younger brother if he is the one relocating.|`|3Y1ondDraa	Just ask them and give evidence that supports your request...<br>  For example, you need space or you'll go insane, you need privacy, he is unbearable to live with, etc. and maybe they'll give it an honest shot.|`|YymOCkWQaa	You go up to them, and in a question format, say "Mom, Dad, may I please have my own room?" Thus, you have successfully asked them if you can have your own room.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	tell them you want your own room and privacy<br>  <br>  if you are older than 8 ill understand<br>  but if you are younger over it<br>  <br>  you will get your own room eventually|`|WHN5cuGZaa	tell them you cant stand it anymore :D.. tell them your big enough.. and all your friends have their own room and it makes you feel bad :D.. try that..|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	just tell her mom i think im old enough to manage my own room|`|zSpFXIrfaa	say u need privacy and your own space.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	(I hope ur old enough for my answer.)<br>  <br>  1. Start leaving your bras on the floor, especially on his side of the room. Your parents will eventually see him near it, holding it, playing with it. When they confront you about it, be COMPLETELY SHOCKED and DISTURBED that your brother was doing this with your bras, and let it be loudly known that you feel you need privacy.<br>  <br>  2. Give your brother a tampon and tell him it's a magic wand (still wrapped!) Give your brother a pad (fresh one!) and tell him they're special cushy stickers. DENY ever giving these things to him. They will figure out on their own that you're going to need a separate space from a 5 year old boy.|`|McfrauFnaa	you cant be shy about it, you just gotta say (parents) i want my own room! if you have to, lie a little and say you can't sleep cause he makes too much noise. he's 5. anyone would believe that even if it isn't true. all else fails you can start sleeping in a sleeping bag outside the room until your parents give in to your demands. good luck!|`|EB5WIpdIaa	Tell Them that your growing up, and your going through hormonal things, and u dont want ur brother going through ur bras, and big girl undies. lol then tell them that you hate sharing a room. and if there is any way they could move you.|`|AGuGhTK5aa	well you should have your own room, your older im guessing and you need your own space so let them know that your too old to share a room with a little sibling. just ask the worst they can say is know.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|lY2XI8kUaa	maybe sit down and explain to them that you need your own room. and tell them why you feel that way|`|CHUDVsbEaa	Tell them your gonna start sleeping naked|`|GPGsUDlGaa	Just ask. Say you need your space n privacy.|`|Ntr75NBzaa	mommy...daddy...can I have my own room pleaseeeee?

Short and simple|`|MuwLvbzMaa	How old are you?
26A3XZD7aa	Well maybe because looking into your eyes would bring old bagage he doesnt wanna deal with looking into one's eyes has that whole  intimacy aspect to it or maybe it was just awkward for him since its been so long since u've seen each other & probably last time he looked you in the eyes was when u left him for another so its probably not so much you as it is his own issues|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Sounds like he's going to pay you back for leaving him for another man.<br>  <br>  He's going to string you along making you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and just when you think you two will get back together, he's going to pull the carpet right from under your feet.<br>  <br>  Even though you may deserve it, he has an agenda for you.|`|U5NQSmDFaa	I bet it is just because he hasn't seen you, in as you say it, FOREVER! Also, he is engaged and, well, he doesn't want to get into trouble. Everyone knows how WOMEN can be!!! haha jk jk! He is just shy, i guess. I hope you enjoyed talking to him. I know i Would! Well, I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  EMILY :)|`|vKb5HYhnaa	He was probably avoiding the intimacy of eye contact, in order to be loyal to his fiancee.|`|xkGfxn70aa	Maybe because he didn't want to remember the hurt that you had caused him in the past.  I'm sure if there are still feelings there then he would contact you.  If you shall here nothing, then mark that one up as your loss|`|g3HrRmaCaa	He either didnt want to bring up old feelings cuz he still has love for you, or he's still pissed over the break up with you. as simple as that.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	he loves his girlfriend, anyways, you left him for a reason, don't fantasize. find someone new|`|bkgBLjuvaa	I'm the same way, I can't look someone directly in the eye... it makes me nervous...|`|bYU77eteaa	He may want to be faithful to his girl...and looking at you for too long stirred up feelings.  He did right by her though.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I suspect it was guilt.  The two of you have a history but he has moved on to someone else.  He probably felt guilty because he knew his current woman probably wouldn't want him standing around having a lengthy conversation with you, but he didn't want to seem rude to you either.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	Sounds like he was worried his girl would see him talking to you and be upset... he has found someone new to love who will not drop him for another guy and does not want to lose that.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	because the one he engaged ones eyes are nicer, perhaps.<br>  so sorry to you.|`|9tyx5BkPaa	shyness i bet.
61Fwbi79aa	Never looked at it that way. You might be on to something|`|TJezsCkHaa	I agree.|`|XrtmT2kUaa	I think there are different definitions to the the term loved or love. You can be in love with someone and things can change. You don't stop loving per say. Maybe the  rose colored glasses you see them in change colors though. For myself personally, love is a very hard word to throw around and not mean it.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	no, I think people can fall in and out of love, depending on their information at the specific time. We grow up every day and we change. Our body cells renew all the time, so do our brain and emotions, so you could love somebody in the past, and now ,,,,, because of what happened, you don't love that person anymore.|`|xkGfxn70aa	I think that LOVED is talking about the person in the past that has past on.  Not that the love that you have for them has stopped in anyway|`|34nmUPt9aa	i think your right.|`|jA9bS9zVaa	I agree.  <br>  <br>  I think a lot of people confuse love with that attachment feeling.  I love lots of people, but I don't want to be with them romantically anymore.|`|AkpikM98aa	,..."did" love

AMxVKwCOaa	Be open to her first.<br>  That will show her that she shouldnt be afraid to express herself to her friend.<br>  Then she should open right up.<br>  <br>  But try and talk about serious subjects so that it can be a little bit more easy for her to open up.|`|FIRpiVYVaa	Tell her you're open to her if she wants to talk. Take it slow or she might clam up and shut you out. Tell her about thing you think she might be interested in that you're interested in.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	open up to her. tell her about your life.hang out with her and do things she likes.all the basics. no offense but why do you need us to tell you this? you know it.|`|K3gqlxonaa	Ask her to do that and let her know why you want her to share that with you.

naPq2mbtaa	if you been dating that long she will stay faithful to you and not cheat.  i don't think you should be jelous about the whole prom thing because you can go with her next year  hoped this helped!!!|`|qg11igznaa	If you prevent her from going she'll resent you for it. Trust her, it's really more important to trust her with something like this than you think. Moreover, girls really love to bring up situations where you made them angry (i.e. didn't let her attend her junior prom), so don't think you can tell her not to go and they'll be the end of it.     A group circle is harmless. It's quite literally a group of people dancing in a circle. No one has a partner. It's usually (almost always) a circle of only girls who came to the dance as a group instead of bringing dates.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	A group circle is what it says-a group of people dancing together in a circle or small group.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You need to stop being jealous and let her go, you only get to go to a few proms in your lifetime, so let her go. She has already told you she just wants to dance in a group circle ( it's just a big circle of people dancing, no one is dancing exclusively with anyone and no one is touching). You need to trust her.|`|b81H0vlYaa	It is her prom!! Let her go and wait until you can next year.  I love my husband, but he totally ruined my Senior prom for me.  So, let her have fun.  Group circle is just that, everyone stands in a circle and just dances, usually it is mostly girls.  Go to the after party with her, that is where the bad stuff that you are worried about happens, not at prom with all of the chaperons there.  And anyway, so what if she dances with other guys, it is just dancing.|`|3vooHXb8aa	Well if you trust her you shouldn't really have anything to worry about. Especially if she told about a group circle and she'll be thinking of you the whole time. A group circle is like a bunch of friends dancing together. You shouldn't worry.|`|46otjIowaa	You should  not be jealous.  You do not trust her if you have a problem with it.  You are acting controlling and jealous.      Group dancing is when a bunch of people are dancing toward each other.  Ever been to a wedding?|`|AldevmIhaa	your school is wierd... most skools have a junior.senior prom. that means that , yeah, you have to b a junior or senior to go UNINVITED. if younger than that, your date has to be junior or senior. you have to b invited by one of them. check dat out wit your school counselor or something. cus im a senior nd i was gonna take ma lil sista. shes a sophmore but she wanted to go (too bad cuz now im goin wit ma boyfrend) lmao|`|0zjrVM8Naa	I think you're worrying too much about this.  Everything will be fine. She's not going to dance with another guy.  She won't because obviously you care about her and she can see that.  You will be okay.  She'll just dance with people in a "group circle."|`|Z3Cilpzzaa	hmmmmm it's okay to be jealous about it, but you shouldn't make her miss her prom.  LET HER GO.  She will only get two chances in her life to go to prom, you don't want to take that away from her.  Imagine (at the worst of course) if you break up a year or so from now and she didn't go to prom because you told her not to..... she is going to feel so aweful that she missed that opportunity because of someone who she's not even with anymore.  If they do a "group circle" I imagine everyone will just be dancing in the same area but not a direct 1 on 1 dance.  Just ask her to be respectful of the relationship while she's at Prom and to have a good time.  Jealousy drives people away, so don't make too big a deal about it.|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	You have to let her live her life. I know it seems like this is it, but you guys most likely won't be together forever, and she shouldn't miss this experience in her life. And, if you really trust her, then you wouldn't be harping on the idea of her dancing with other guys. Its JUST dancing. She shouldn't be grinding or anything, but dancing isn't anything to be jealous of.|`|TebPFTrJaa	Hey  Sorry I don't understand all this senior, junior and sophomore stuff but I think you should let her go and trust her a little more. If your really skeptical about it you could ask someone who is a junior to keep an eye on her for you, but remember if you get found out that your the master mind behind all of it your screwed.  Hope I helped|`|z1RmCqBbaa	there will be other dances you and her can go to. like yours for example. don't be jealous, you've been together for so long and you shouldn't let the prom mess that up. =) good luck

It's not ok for him to even talk to her. She will keep trying until he puts a stop to it.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Uh-oh.  Sounds to me like she is trying to make him feel bad, doing the woe-is-me, I'm so sad and helpless routine.  Guys and girls can get sucked in by that.  He probably does feel sorry for her - the question is, if it keeps on happening, then he needs to put his foot down.  Keep an eye on the phone bill.|`|1uRUaSblaa	He has the choice to cut off all contact from her.<br>  You need to sit down and talk to him.<br>  He is not obliged to listen the other woman out since<br>  he is already married to you.Set the limit.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	Girl... I say take a dump wrap it in tissue and hide it in his coat pocket ! Or better yet..smear it behind the rear view mirror|`|IfOTZhQyaa	First if you act like the jealous type and start hounding him you will push him away.  You need to protect your husband without being over baring. let him know that you are interested in helping him resolve the issue he has with this other woman. How he needs to close that chapter in his life because he is in a new one. Tell him how you feel sorry for her to because see will always live a life of self denial and she will always hurt the people how loves her like her husband. Be supportive and slow to anger. Be more of a listener without stopping in being a protector of you home. Tell him that you love him and that you are going to trust that he will do the right thing.|`|cDC1FHTDaa	Let just slow down a little here. I have a ex-lover that I talked to every blue moon, and my wife has a ex that she talks to sometimes. Just because we talk to the person does not mean we are having sex. Sometime we don't tell the other person that we talk to are ex is because our mate might just hit the roof. When my wife tell her co-worker about talking to her ex, most say "oh my God my husband would kill me if I did that," or they would say, " if my husband talk to his ex I would kick his butt and her butt". If you husband is talking to his ex, ask him if there is anyone thing you "both" can do to help her. Let you mate know you trust him, Until he give you a reason not too. I am not trying to make up any excuses but yelling at him will only  push him closer to her.
f4keqWZfaa	everyone puts up with what they are familiar with from their history, and thats usually from their family upbringing. the point is what do you really want, if you don't want to put up with stuff just come out and say it. 'Hey, I don't like this and that" and i aint putting up with it no longer, period. then you have to act on what you say or else no one will believe you. Mostly, peops never believe you until you actually do something about what you say. so .. just DO IT! what ever you decide|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	"Put up with"?  If you're already asking yourself this question early in the game, something might be forced.  In the beginning or the "honeymoon stage" you should just have fun and not have to dissect the developing relationship and blooming feelings.<br>  <br>  But for the sake of giving you a clear answer:  Don't put up with anything more than you would from a trusted best friend.  After all, isn't that what we seek in a relationship??|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Kind of a strange question because you shouldn't have to put up with anything to be with someone.

I don't put up with being disrespected or abused.|`|aMmfTVzEaa	If it's love then putting up with stuff is just part of it.

This is a huge one and one you control; confidence (not cocky) and a cute smile.<br>   Personality (much more important); Funny!  Girls like funny guys.  Be nice to her always, even when your friends are there,say hi in the hall, just an extra step we really go for.  Don't be a playa or a jerk, it amazes me how many guys don't know this.  Hard to get = byebye girl, we don't just stick around.  Smart guys are always a bonus.  Religious for me, maybe not for some.<br>  PS.  Drinking, smoking, drugs all = major turnoff.<br>  Also, compliment her!  Make her feel special.  Don't be cheesy though.<br>  And guys have to make the first move most times, sorry.<br>  If she rejects you, get over her.<br>  DO NOT be stalkerish, huge turnoff.|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Well usually girls either like a boy or they don't.

Honestly what you need to do is have a serious open and truthful talk with him. Sit him down when you feel the time is right and explain to him how you feel about his recent behavior and how you think its immature for his age and for this relationship. You need to tell him that you value the relationship very much and you love him with all your heart but that you don't appreciate his behavior and how he refuses to listen continuously because its disrepectful. Yes people in a relationship may have differences and their habits but tell him you don't like it and want him to stop it because he is grown man and should act his age. Also I'm assuming you consider this a serious relationship and are'nt playing around so you should definitely tell him that too. <br>  <br>  Although I should warn you because no matter which way you choose to handle the situation he may think you're overreacting because he probably considers the way he is acting as just a small thing that won't cause conflict between you two because its funny to him but he's wrong, I've heard of things like this either making or breaking a relationship.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you. Good luck.
TvGqrcr9aa	My family is exactly like that too. You can try to talk to them about it when they aren't drunk, maybe they'll listen. <br>  Calling CPS won't change them and will bring down a whole world of problems that you really don't need (trust me) unless you feel that it's so bad you absolutely cannot live with them or you're being abused.<br>  The only other thing I can suggest is to refuse to be in the car with them like that. It's what I do and my family thinks I'm crazy but hey, you have to protect yourself.|`|Sdx6LKVQaa	confront them tell them that you believe its not safe and that you can risk your lives doing someting like that <br>  not trying to be mean and all that but if you believe that they are like real serious drinkers then you should put them to one of those cut back alcohol activity thingy|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	next time, refuse to go with them if they keep on drinking and driving.|`|E7TkNO00aa	You hide their keys, call a taxi, and have the taxi drive all of them home.

My friends dad would drive drunk with her, and she told her counselor that he drove on the sidewalk, and the counselor called CPS, because it's NOT safe. Not only can he kill himself, but you and others who are innocent. Tell someone because this is not safe. <br>  If you can drive, why don't you. Refuse to go home with them, and say "I'm not going if you're drunk!" They shouldn't drink and drive at ALL.
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Like you, I couldn't give up the education I have strived for or the independence that my earning money gives me.<br>  This is something my fiance & I discussed when we were talking about getting married and he knows that if we have children (its not a definite and we aren't planning on it) that I wouldn't give up working.<br>  Fortunately, my fiance is OK with that and we aren't planning on having kids so there really is no need to plan for one of us to not work.<br>  <br>  I think you've done the right thing for you and unless you reach out to him and ask to go to counseling to work through it, I don't see how anything can possibly change.  Also, you are right to have something this huge be a "deal breaker" for you.  Counseling may get him to see things your way, but I hope you wouldn't use it as a way to get you to lower your feelings or what you value so you two could be together.<br>  <br>  STICK TO YOUR GUNS!!|`|o1yy6KABaa	Stick to your guns on this one, hes not going to back down on it no matter how much it means to you, and dont give in to him..its  good thing you found out all this now and not later.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Are you planning on having kids as soon as you are married, because then I could understand him wanting you to stay at home.<br>  Otherwise it is kinda weird and I think you are right to have a say in your own life. <br>  To me it would not be a dealbreaker as I can work from home, but if he didn't want me to make any money at all and stay home it would probably end the relationship.<br>  If I did stay I would be sure to be 100% in controll of the finances and I would be putting some away for myself for a rainy day.|`|PBdPD748aa	i think the REAL issue here is compromise....<br>  <br>  the fact that he is FORCING you to do something, no matter what it is is the problem.<br>  <br>  One of the most important aspects of a relationship is compromise. Love is supposed to be unconditional - and due to him just wanting to walk on the relationship because you wouldnt 'listen' to him really means he does not unconditional love or accept you.<br>  <br>  i really think you have done the right thing, even IF you wanted to stay at home, his mentality about the whole situation is wrong - imagine what else could have been in line down the track.<br>  <br>  He should want you to be happy no matter what - and if working made you happy he should have been happy for you. he seems extremely selfish and one sided so really, you did yourself a huge favour - thank god it wasnt after the wedding!|`|4ykgt6rBaa	I am an independent woman I would not be able to just stay at home.

Currently I'm unemployed though because I was recently laid off, and still a student, so all of my energy goes towards that.<br>  <br>  It sounds like his idea of marriage is somewhat outdated, and that you are a more modern woman.

Depends how he is.<br>  <br>  Asking someone out for a date shouldn't be something you're hesitant of doing...it's a great way of expressing to one another and building an intimacy level.

If you really like him, then go for it,  but try to be subtle, sometimes outright asking can be disastrous, what you need to do is to pull him aside one day and talk to him, tell him what you are feeling, and maybe he'll open up and show you that he is feeling the same way.|`|eNfTWtDHaa	Email, text, IM, note, call, face to face.

jiJi5CgCaa	A true friend will always have your back. They hold you when you down and alone you can pick up the phone tell them your situation and they will turn around and say everything is going to be alright or even come see you and tell you everything is going to alright. They listen to you when you have a problem. They want to know whats in your mind instead of whats in you pocket or how much money you got. A friend wont judge you for what you did wont give you a dirty look like why did you do that. They don't all have to like every little thing you do but they like most things you like music, art, tv, books, subjects, majors, etc.. They wont be mad at you for not being as independent as they are they wont judge you like that... the ppl you are hanging with now dont sound like your friends my friends dont do that they are like family to me i call them my sisters or even my brother even though they r not related to me...I call them my friends....your friends should treat you equally like you are their friend not like someone who is just there and lower than them but at the same page as them...I would listen to your family let your friends go that are like that and meet better and get to know other friends|`|WQhV4Amgaa	your true friends will stick up for you. punch someone that insults you, give you things, it depends on if you like oppisite personalities or similar ones about that. i personally have a few great friends of both.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Well when I think of what I want out of a best friend they would be caring,loyal,trustworthy,friendly,funny,... always have your back no matter what the situation,they listen to you for hours on end,they are respectful to people around them, and they carry themselves well. If you are looking for new friends, I would really look for what values and traits that you enjoy in a friend. You can always join different activities to get out there and find new friends or wherever you like to go. Just remember when you are looking for friends, find out what makes you happy.
QCfOUgxnaa	I am really, truly, and seriously madly in love with my husband.  I couldn't be happier, and I couldn't imagine my life without him.  It is possible!  My parents and grandparents have been together forever and always loyal to each other- and SO happy and in love.  <br>  <br>  But love IS A CHOICE!!  It's not just destiny and fate.  As long as your marriage is your priority AND your spouse's priority- there is no reason why it can't be bliss.  Sure there are problems to work out- but there are many more ups than downs.  Love only fades when we stop giving it.  So if you keep dating your spouse, even after marriage- and flirting and romancing each other- it will only get better.  It's only when people put careers and friends and money above each other- that it diminishes.  <br>  <br>  The best advice I ever got from my parents- go on a weekly date with your husband. No matter what.  Even if it's after the kids go to bed and it's just cuddling.  EVERY WEEK set aside time to romance and reconnect.  If you want something to last forever- you treat it differently.  :)|`|AA11225089	Hi, I met my husband when I was 16 and he was 20. We have not been together exclusively all these years but as good as. We have survived the separation of university, the stress of financial meltdown, an unplanned pregnancy, the deaths of 3 parents between us, an affair, and a change of religious persuasion. Obviously this has not always been easy, but we have always known that we are meant to be together and through forgiveness and understanding we have made it work. <br>  <br>  We are now following the same faith (Christian) and I believe firmly that has been the source of our staying together. The support and advice we have been given by our fellow believers has been immense. I can tell you that after 13 years of marriage, we keep getting closer, and although marriage is never 100% what you would like it to be, I would not want things to be different. <br>  <br>  The problem with most relationships these days is that both parties want to be the top dog as it were. When major decisions need to be made and you have different opinions, one of you has to back down. If you don't trust your partner to make the right choice, that is hard to do. Again, because of my faith, I trust God to help us make the right choice together. As you can see from my testimony, this doesn't always ensure a perfect life, but things always work out in the end.<br>  <br>  My parents got divorced when I was 19, and I have got 3 best friends who are divorced, and many aunties and uncles who are divorced too. This has not stopped me from staying with my husband. The world may be scary, but it doesn't have to dictate what life should be like.|`|Q2MLikeUaa	yes marriage does work but only if you love, with the exclusion of all others, the person you are with. There is an old saying, marry in haste, repent at leisure, and this is true, you have to be sure before you walk down the aisle and say yes.|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	People pretend to be happy a lot more than they are actually happy in marriage. A wise cynic once said that the only time people get married is when he knows she's the best he can do, she knows he's the best she can do, and they realize it at the same time. That's basically it. You sell out your chance at personal happiness for pair-security. One day that might seem like a good thing to you. Until then, don't settle -- there's no magic in it you can't see. But if you ever sell out and get married, enjoy the couple life and put off kids for as long as you can -- your chance for individual happiness, or even happiness as a couple, really goes down the toilet when the kids arrive and take over your life. Good luck. Make the good choices I didn't.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi, you will have a very negative thoughts in marriage in your life with a pseudonym of CheckMate, like it's finished, doomed, <br>  you get what I mean ? Em....., just joking, OK ?<br>  <br>  Anyway, first and foremost, marriage is not for game.<br>  You had to sacrifice, commit, share, built, a whole lot more and even to<br>  harmonies all the balances.<br>  Anyway, I'm single and I might be wrong with my perception and mostly there<br>  are people who look down on me as I'm broke and single and a lot of people<br>  advice me not to be ''picky'', if you know what I mean.<br>  Seriously, I cannot support any one now if by chance there's a girl that will<br>  come and stay with me or stuffs.<br>  But my mind never settles, as I still believe in what I can do and always try<br>  to find a way to make it happen.<br>  So, like what you'd said, <br>  real love, deeply in love, can't imagine being with another person mutual kind of marriages. I, on the other hand are always chasing someone like skies the limit. So, until you really had someone like how you described the above<br>  mentioned, then I believe that you still haven't found the one.<br>  As a matter of fact, you must have YOUR own perception of where you wants<br>  to head or the direction that you wants to reach. As this decisions is in your hand, if you can, I mean, so NO WAY of steering away from what you really need first.<br>  That's why mostly people will married with the ones who had a same interest<br>  as more like a first policy, and of course there're some who chase after money<br>  and so on, right ?<br>  So for the romance part of it, some people will take it one day at a time AND<br>  some will live like it is the LAST DAY itself.<br>  Thus, the momentum keep on building without actually stopping, OK ?|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Marriage is tough and has to go deeper than the looks. I love my husband but some times he does piss me off but that is because he is my best friend and I am sure I piss him off sometimes too. That is okay though because we are friends and friends have different opinions. Plus without a disagreement from time to time that would be boring. It is visa versa with our sex life but I stick it out because when we do have it it is amazing.It is not quantity it is quality you will learn this in a few years. It is not always a piece of cake it takes allot of effort and dedication but it is rewarding when you sit back and see what you both have accomplished together through all your trials and tribulations!<br>  Only words are do not get married if you can not tell the other person everything. You will know it is the right one if you know every quark and you still love them.|`|ixRkfLjIaa	Just because something is possible, does not make it probable.  Nor does it make it a good idea. <br>  <br>  Some people can fall hundreds of feet off a bridge and live, so its possible, but not a good idea to try.<br>  <br>  Someone will make it, but the odds are that it won't be you.<br>  <br>  If half of all planes crashed, would you get on a plane?|`|cQw6JueFaa	Marrage will work if you and your spouse can understand, trust and communicate with one another.<br>  however... just as Tom Lykis says.<br>  It dosnt work for everyone.

But it is work too.  But it only works where there is trust.  There are so many other factors that make it work or not. <br>  <br>  For me my husband is my best friend and our relationship only grows stronger because we both take our commitment seriously and truly treat this as our family now, because to us it is.  <br>  <br>  We both have strong personalities and are happy to have our own separate interests and share so many.  My husband really is my partner, and for me he is perfect, flaws and all.

rwodna0waa	Sounds to me like he is a loser, and sort of a spoiled rotten brat. I have a brother in law that sounds A LOT like what you are describing. He's a loser too. He does NOTHING and he is almost 20. He's had a job here and there for like a day or two but that's it. I think you sound pretty resposible, maybe you should lead by example. Maybe if he sees you doing well in life, he will follow your lead. Maybe you should try to set him up with a girl or something. He might wanna do better if he has someone to impress. Good luck! And you know, if all else fails, give a Marine Corps Recruiter his name and number...,maybe they can straighten him out!!|`|ZyiVlnINaa	My God girl, that's a little on the caddy side.  <br>  <br>  HE IS YOUR BRO---except that and deal with that.<br>  <br>  my bro is over 9 years my senior and he is the naturally smart one, more so charming, and incredibly wonderful in the way only a brother can be.  would you be able to deal with him? no. do i love him anyway? by God yes.<br>  <br>  you cannot pick ur family, an age old truth, and lemme tell you, whining about them to strangers wont help things either.  <br>  <br>  simple solution, let him be his own person.  if we all conformed to what otheres expected of us we would get no where...and as usual the best thing to do is let people live their own lives and dont meddle in their business.  simple as that.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	the long and short of it is,, none of what your brother does is any of your business.  concern yourself with you and not your brother and you will be much happier.
EZ1cPPvkaa	I think you know the answer to that question, if everything you say is true than it is undoubtedly abuse.  <br>  If life is that miserable with your mother, I can't imagine why you wouldn't prefer to live with your father?  <br>  I'm sure you also know that running away almost without exception results in the "run-away" being returned to their home, which doesn't seem like it would be helpful at all to your situation.  Talking to a therapist is an option, a school psychologist maybe.  If you do reveal your mother's behaviour to them they will have no choice but to report it, and that might not be such a bad idea.  <br>  Again, I urge you to consider why this miserable home environment is preferable to you over your father's.|`|QYahxUEWaa	Yes, it is abuse. I suggest you to talk to your dad before anybody else.|`|lz2hw676aa	What's the reason you don't want to live with your dad?  It is a very hard question.  I understand where you are coming from.  Sounds like your mom has a bunch of issues...If you want to stay at home with her, I would just lay low and find a hobby to pursue at home.  Singing, dancing, writing, spiritual, something....just try to stay out of her way...but if she keeps attacking you and you cant deal with it and you may cause harm to yourself...go ahead and call CPS....or talk to someone at your school...so they can get you out of that situation.<br>  <br>  You have to at least try and see what your other options are...before you committ suicide or run away.   Those both are bad options.  You would be better off in a decent foster home...where you could stay in school, go to college and become a nurse, so that you may be able to live a decent life.....|`|yw5J2J6faa	OMFG! You bet your *** its abuse! Your mother is not "your mother". She is dead, the good side of her dont even exist anymore. BUT why are you letting her doing this to you ALL THE TIME. She ****** has issues AND she is suppose to be teaching you how to be independent like other older teens. Here is what you should do tell me where you live and I will give you that respective runaway hotline. But if she doesnt let you use the phone "sigh" i dont know what to know you but otherwise sorry :(|`|gYT1zAZqaa	If you tell someone then she can't kill you. You need to get a councelor and tell him/her, and think about a family member that would take you in. Then pack your thing and get a ride to thier house, and explain the situation. Continue talking to your counceler. This is how I escaped from my parents, and the abuse. I realy don't want to say what kind, but if you want to talk more you can email me at JoannaMichelle15@Yahoo.com. Good luck! Your giong to need it.|`|OLUkLlR3aa	I'm sorry that she is abbusing you... this isnt right and you should definetly call this number and report it. There is help and dont be afraid to get it...

If shes kept some kind of abuse going since may then i could see it as pattern behavior. If others disagree than they might agree shes a hot target for potential abuser in the long term|`|qZTIVDwqaa	Well the police can't do much unless you have visible marks on your body.|`|Se2Ko2NKaa	i guess, tell her to **** off and kick her ***!|`|upoH8NP4aa	ya. totally. i mean, if i kid was abused at age ten, and is now like, sixteen, the abusive parent can still be sent to jail. talk 2 a councler.(unless u reli reli love yur mom, and u dont want anythin 2 happen 2 her i guess) the consequences can b dire.|`|8ngDDwhVaa	yes. it's still abuse. if she did it once, she might do it again. but if she does it twice, she will do it again. So if she ever hurts you again, talk to someone.|`|roIJeulpaa	if it is any type of abuse, it is abuse such as hitting, smacking, kicking, etc. You should tell someone next time something like this happens it's very important.|`|3NQwqx9Saa	if ur mum hurts you all the time it counts as abuse evan as abusive words but if ur mum does it sometimes it doesn't count as it discipline's you to be respect full so it is not abuse hope this has answered your problem bye|`|HzUM8hVSaa	yes it can still be considered abuse.|`|gkThLcf2aa	Nah its not really abuse. You probably deserve it|`|8x3e7Gmjaa	yeah... it doesnt matter when it happens its still abuse, you should let someone know because your mom might be losin it.|`|qfe5GOcMaa	yeahh, if she abuses u once in a while the depression and memories still come back|`|AA11944397	From what you describe, this is still abuse.  And psychological/emotional abuse can be just as harmful and painful for a child as physical abuse.  <br>  ***Physical abuse is generally defined as "any nonaccidental physical injury to the child" and can include striking, kicking, burning, or biting the child, or any action that results in a physical impairment of the child. <br>  Emotional Abuse:<br>  All States and territories except Georgia and Washington include emotional maltreatment as part of their definitions of abuse or neglect. Approximately 22 States, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico provide specific definitions of emotional abuse or mental injury to a child.8 Typical language used in these definitions is "injury to the psychological capacity or emotional stability of the child as evidenced by an observable or substantial change in behavior, emotional response, or cognition," or as evidenced by "anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or aggressive behavior."<br>  Information provided by: <a href="http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/l...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You may want to speak with another adult (i.e. teacher, family member, guidance counselor) and get their opinion on what to do.  <br>  This sounds like a hard situation, and i wish you the best.|`|e913314056b0ff092cd25829149fdd7faa	what do you mean by physical abuse?|`|655cc68ef8d7913644636e7bace4a60faa	u did not come with an instruction book... i am not defending ur mom but u did not give me enuf of an explanation to get a full understanding of what is going on...  what was going on in ur house in may, how were u behaving, do u have other sis & bros, is mom a single parent???  all these ???s and then some shld be asked b4 anyone has the rite to judge...<br>  <br>  sometimes kids go off the wall and do things out of the norm and as a parent we do not know how to deal... the imagination gets the best of us and most of the time we always go to the worst scenario; especially if the kid does not talk about their feelings and just shut us out... <br>  <br>  u say mom has not touched u since may and i say mom is probably still suffering over it as much as u r... and yet u both r not talking about it at all, so it continues to fester... don't let it fester anymore.<br>  <br>  wait for a good time and talk to ur mom and let her know how u r feeling.  if mom is busy then i suggest asking her when she is done "can we talk, it is important to me" and make sure u have her full attention.  tell her that it is bothering u and u need to get it out of ur system, let her know that u understand she is only human and it isn't easy raising a teenager but u r hurt and u wld like to talk about it... when u state ur case ask her to listen to u and when u r done then u can listen to her.<br>  <br>  sometimes mom's r sooooo busy and life frustrates us soooo much and we don't even have time to think... again i'm not defending ur mom, she was wrong for doing it but u have to look at the situation from both sides... and again it is probably hurting her as well.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry u r going thru this by urself but u don't have to, that is what moms r for.  obviously u luv ur mom and she luvs u bcuz this ??? cld of been a lot worse than this... how is she suppose to know that this is still bothering u unless u tell her... talk to her, no yelling, no judging, no overbearing typical teenage attitude (not that u r like that bcuz idk u) just talk...<br>  be straight and let her know if it happens again then dial 911.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps...<br>  God bless.

Figure out what the real issues are in your marriage & work on that.|`|jA9bS9zVaa	You must stop this craziness!  How could you do this to anyone involved??  That is not love.  End the relationship so that your brain can detach from him, this thing you call love is just hormones gone wild.  Those attachment hormones are tricking you, just like a drug addiction, that you must have this person.  Stop.  stop.  stop.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	The first thing is you never see this man, or our friend ever again, starting right now. You write the friend a letter, and hope that things will be cleared up when he mans up and admits it to her. This will come out, whether you like it or not, so you need to tell your husband asap. It's the only chance you have to save your marriage and family. I can't tell you how your husband will react, but it's the only chance you have now.<br>  <br>  And you just found yourself in love with another man? No. You let what should have been a mild crush go too far. You could have stopped this at any point. Things you never thought you could do, could have been done with your husband. You better find the strength very quickly.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Live in reality and stop being a drama junkie. It may seem exciting for now but fast forward to you and he together and ask yourself "Will it really be the best arrangement to be with him minus all the drama?"|`|9yurQ85Eaa	This will eat at you forever until you do the right thing and break it off if you want to save your family not to mention it may end anyway if your husband or his wife find out. Trust me its going to haunt you until you come clean 100%.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Keep your legs closed.<br>  <br>  You keep giving yourself excuses to continue this affair full well knowing how it will effect your family and his.<br>  <br>  If your marriage is that stagnant, then do something about it versus doing someone else.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	Marriage sucks!!!|`|Whd6tqLzaa	You have to stop having an affair. If you are unhappy in your marriage, tell your husband and get a divorce. There is no way your affair will go unnoticed. Your husband will somehow find it out or the other woman will find out. <br>  <br>  My husband had an affair with a married woman, a mother of four.  He managed to keep it secret for more than 3 years. Finally, I found out. They were very careful but I have found tons of evidence. I kicked him out of my house. My children despise him. Did he go back to that woman? No. You enjoyed the secrecy, but now that everything is open, he wants to come back to my house. But, my door is closed for him forever.<br>  <br>  What will you do if one of your spouses find out your affair? It will ruin your life forever. Get out of this mess if there is still time.

I am also 15 and i've never been in a relationship, i haven't found anyone for me yet and i'm just not really ready. don't rush anything or be in a hurry to find someone, we are only 15 and we have our whooole lives ahead of us =) plus, this is the time for us to be having fun, spending time with our friends, focusing on school & finding ourself. sometimes relationships distract you from that. So just be yourself and stop looking. if you meet someone that you really like and that likes you back, go for it ! but until then, just enjoy being single ! I hope i helped*|`|NEMX2Y6maa	Be somewhat mean and indifferent. I know its strange but girls like attention form the guys who don't give much attention. Approach them as an person rather than a girl, then wait for them to warm up to you.<br>  <br>  Showing too much emotion up front is not good for girls. Say "hi" with little interest and don't hold out for more than a second for a reply (waiting makes you needy and desperate).<br>  <br>  Indifference is the key!|`|sY1itvPkaa	You just have bad luck. That sucks. But don't worry. There will be girls that come to you. But you gotta be the one to make a move on them.|`|INLQHsl7aa	find a new girl, but make sure she dont have a bf.
KwNpyp3saa	Karma isn't when a family member dies because they were a jerk. Karma happens to them, directly. This happened to his sister and he is effected by it. <br>  <br>  There is nothing you can say to your friend. She seems too upset by his behavior to see straight. Just let her cool off and talk to her again. If this doesn't work then move on to another friend.|`|mAorBf7saa	I think it sounds like she really needs to learn some empathy.  (Or at least sympathy.)  I think you need to be nice to her, but I really don't think she sounds like the best friend material.|`|K3gqlxonaa	Yes you should let her know how u feel about her vain and uncareing feelings about someone who has exited this life. Life is all we have and when it's gone, so are we. Remind her that the problem she has with him, did not warrant her careless tongue toward his sister. Let her know that that was rude and very feelingless and that you don't appreciate it.
uVv8lsgxaa	Take a picture and mail it to his girlfriend anonymously! What a cowardly jerk!|`|SsfnitjXaa	Not your problem|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Hon. you've probably got enough going on in yr life without getting mixed up in someone else's drama's.  I know it hurts when you see injustice being done to a friend, but karma will get this cheating man.  His wife will find out soon enough, don't play with fire you will end up getting burnt.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Mail an anonymous typed letter to her home, addressed to her. No return address. Don't go into specifics, just drop the hint. Let her do the rest. Too much info may be traced back to you.|`|iD4ejChZaa	call her and tell her, she has the right to know, my friend's friend got aids from her cheating husband, geee-- maybe somebody should have been honest with her.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	send his wife a note but make sure its typed out and not written and keep your mouth shut about it|`|Xhaa1nVNaa	think about it... if ur hubby were to cheat on u,,, u wud like to know right???? So i say yes send her an anonymous letter... or if u have pix of them send them to her....|`|J9PSQTeraa	Would you like to know?  I would tell her, she does not deserve this, if your husband knows, you know and the lady this guy is having an affair with knows I'm sure there will be another 20 people that know as well by now.  She's is looking like a fool and she doesn't even know about it.  People will start avoiding her because they don't want to say antyhing or get involved so yes she has the right to know.  You should remain anonymous though as it may cause problems between you and your husband.  The problem wiht men is they actually think it's OK to cheat and the old "boys" club will always stand up for each other.  You should just type her an anonymous letter that way it can't be traced back to anyone!|`|3hBQz33Yaa	the messenger is usually the one that always gets shot. the man is a pig but if you become involved it could cause even more drama with you and even your husband smack dab in the middle. the wife will eventually find out what a pig her husband is. hopefully sooner than later but she needs to find out on her own.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	As A woman who was cheated on myself. I would have to say that I would like to have known. I wish someone had told me . Seems everybody else did. It makes a complete fool of the one being cheated on.<br>  I would be inclined to send her a letter. She most likely will be upset at first. But best she knows. Keep your mouth shut and tell no one it was you. You are doing this lady a courtesy believe me.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	I am in  the same situation.  Usually the  person who tells ends up being the bad person.  So, I don't know.  If you know her cell phone number, maybe send a text over the internet.  I have not done that, but I have really thought about it.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	nope, you just need to mind your own business and let the wife find out on her own, and trust me she will find out.|`|8o7s9tynaa	Stay away from this situation. You're playing with fire and are likely to get burnt.|`|TJezsCkHaa	your husband asked you not to get involved,so don't for your own sake.As for his wife,she will find out soon!|`|AkpikM98aa	Drop her a tip on his location or go have a drink w/ her where he may be disappearing to.<br>  Or how about you make mention of noticing so many numbers you dont remember dialing on your phone bill, maybe subconciously she will start checking hers out more closely and find out for herself.|`|luI9VyEMaa	if you see them together than tell your friend to go to the same place and she'll see by herself w. her own eyes

I love it!|`|7upShB9Yaa	My cousin walked down the isle to a traditional wedding march song so I don't really have any suggestions for that. But I do have one for the groom. Instead of him just walking to the front with no music, my cousin had her husband walk (he more or less strutted) down the isle to the song "Another One Bites The Dust". No one knew about it except for the person doing the music, the bride and groom. So it was a big surprise for everyone and really funny.<br>  Her flower girl and ring bearer walked down the isle to the disney song "When you wish upon a star". Which was so cute.<br>  So there's a couple of idea's for you. Good luck!|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	If you can make the transitions between the songs seamless without any awkward silences (or also known as "dead air"), go for it.<br>  <br>  It still seems kinda over the top, tho, but if you must have music for the kids, then go for it, but DO IT WELL.<br>  <br>  :D <br>  <br>  Best of luck !

Or choc syrup.<br>  <br>  The other week, they had something interesting on Oprah.  They asked each person in a relationship to write down the 5 things they would most like done to them and then give it to their mate.  One guy said he had been married for over 20 years and he thought he knew what she wife wanted.  But he tried her list and she was so happy, that she repaid his....willingness to please her.

But to make it really official, he has to actually ask you out (or you ask him out, it's the 21st century).|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Everyone is different about this sort of thing but it definitely makes things easier if the guy specifically asks a girl to be his girlfriend. Girls are always ready to be in a relationship, they're just waiting to be asked. But they don't ask the guy because guys always seem to be nervous about labels and that type of thing. So if you're ready, ask her!|`|dYN3bdnKaa	I make sure that it's actually SAID between the two of you.<br>  <br>  To many times one person thinks it's just casual, and the other<br>  is thinking that it's going somewhere.<br>  Talk about it, and make sure that your on the same page.|`|zv4qNmAlaa	the last guys comment was totally innapropriate, but i would say after the first kiss?|`|osoTq2dcaa	well my boyfriend asked me what we were after a month .... so just ask|`|8aa5f85b4dd536239b8ade249d0de719aa	When you can fart in front of each other and say "That was blooody good".|`|9dF0sgjEaa	generally yes, you have to mutually establish something together.

Some people have thrown away those terms altogether, showing that all that matters is your feelings for one another. My suggestion though, is that most women like the formal invitation into your life. If your that close already, just ask her out. It should make her happy, and then it'll be behind you.|`|AZ4Wjxjgaa	once you makeout.|`|JjUBlGWmaa	if you say, "want to be bf and gf?" and the other person says "yes"|`|X0nLl8Zbaa	its basically the same thing. talk to each other about it if youre not sure.|`|3eea6e5c934e4e0ecf0ffb555cd24622aa	When you become exclusive, and you make a commitment not to date anyone else.

You are not the one that has to deal with him anymore. Be thankful for that. She will probably still marry him because she thinks that he's done with the games since he is marrying her.|`|q1NGyaBraa	yeah id say becauser she believed u|`|7mtdqUpwaa	Who knows why? I really think that you should cut off ties with them and go on with your own life. At least she apologized and maybe she doesn't want to meet you because it would be embarrassing for her. You and her are better off without that scumbag. I hope she dumps him as well. No one should be in a relationship with him until he cleans up his act. <br>  <br>  At least you found out before it was too late, what a jerk he really is. But don't think you wasted your time in your relationship. I think you can even learn from the worst relationships. I was in a crappy relationship and my ex and I had been engaged but I called it off. I think what I learned is how to be a better judge of character for next time. I think all relationships teach you something. So your time has not been wasted, now you can spend your time looking for the right guy.

I thought I was average, I must be some kind of savant.....)<br>  <br>  Not that unusual. No. But I have always managed to keep up in my relationships.|`|W3hAzpHaaa	Yea...And i think its because males reach orgams quicker than females...I mean one of you is gonna have an orgasm first and sexual activity decreases or stops all together once orgasm is reached because hormonal levels go down ...but i think in average guys are more sexual than females females want it...but men need it...(just make sure your in control and dont do anything crazy like sleeping with 50 guys in one night, of course im over exaggerating) but it is rare that girls are or have a higher sex drive than men...i know one girl in my school who always keeps talking about sex...i have never asked her but im pretty sure she has done it with many guys and is really sexual...it depends from person to person (an average person has at least sex every 2 times a day) and each sexual intercourse lasts about 14 minutes for guys Most women desire a little more than that from what ive heard ( 30 minutes or more )|`|LOFmGU89aa	Three to seven times a day is all I need.|`|UkPkIaxjaa	higher drive which is super cool !!!|`|Xmaby3fZaa	I used to think that I had a really high sex drive, but my boyfriend's is even higher! seeing both ends of the spectrum was interesting because you need to understand that he's not going to be able to keep up and that's not his fault.

c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i liked that he took the time to get dressed up and caught me completely by surprise.  he made it even better by kind of lying and making it seem like he hadn't done much all day.  i wasn't mad, just kind of in that state of mind thinking 'why can't he get up off his butt...?'.  once i'd seen how much trouble he'd gone to, i felt bad for thinking that way!  he had dozens of candles lit and turned off the lights.  he'd also made a picnic to celebrate a memory of the past.  it was really nice.    i'd suggest recreating a very fond memory...one that she might think you'd forgotten about (or that she even forgot about!).|`|itbkP9HGaa	It was a total surprise to me.  I didn't even know he had gotten a ring, although he did know what kind of ring I liked.  Its a good thing i'm not picky, I just told him I liked princess cut on a plain band.  Anyway, it was a complete surprise to me, and he started saying sweet things to me, and I still didn't get it.  We were sitting at a restaurant table on the patio, overlooking the water, and I just thought we were being romantic.  When he took out the box with the ring, tears immediately filled my eyes because I had no idea this was coming.  It was the best, most sincere, most romantic proposal.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	The best thing that he did for me was buy me the dress for the evening with shoes, and sent me to get my hair done. But buying the dress was cute, he is not that kind of guys and had to convince my sister to go with him to pick it out. I know that he went out of his comfort zone. He also recreated some of our stuff from our first date. Really anything that is special between you enhance.!|`|29I8PWrxaa	My fiance proposed to me while we took a walk through a downtown Christmas lights set-up.  I loved it even though it wasn't at some extravagant restaurant or in Paris or something because of exactly what you are saying - the "small things".  He got down on one knee in the middle of the park, and even though it was so cold out, he knelt with one knee in the slush and snow on the ground!  He had a little piece of paper with a little speech written out so he would remember it because he said he was so nervous.  The speech was about how much he loved me and wanted me to be his wife, and all the things we have gone through together.  Even though some might have preferred a memorized speech, I'm so glad he had it on paper because in the moment I couldn't even remember what he was saying to me - and since it was on paper I now will keep it forever as a special keepsake from that moment to remind me of all the nice things he said to me.  He then pulled out a beautiful ring out of his pocket and asked me to marry him!  I also love how he had talked to my father beforehand to get my parent's blessing and to tell them how much he loves and respects me.    All in all, it was a really special moment, and yes, the small things are the things that mean the most to me and that I brag about to my friends when I tell them about his proposal.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Before we became engaged my fiance would always ask me when we were getting married and I would always say, 'when I have a ring on this finger', and hold up my ring finger.  Well one night we went out to dinner and he asked me the same question and I had the same response and he pulled a ring out of his pocket and said, 'like this?'.  It was really special to us.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	my fiance proposed to me at 10:30 in the morning while my hair was a mess, i hadnt showerd yet, and i was still in my pajamas.  if that isnt love, i dont know what is.    that was two christmas eves ago and i still think about it cause if he loves me even when my hair looks like a birds nest and im still in my pajamas, then yeah, we're pretty much set|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	The things I liked best when I said yes was the look on his face, the tears in his eyes and the kiss from his lips.  Considering we were playing pool at the time it was so romantic.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Don't over think this. My favorite things were the little ones like how he looked like he was going to pass out; how he played our song twice because he hadn't worked up the nerve the first time it played and how he opened the ring box with so much force the ring popped out!     Just be natural and don't try to force anything. Good luck to you!|`|7CKipTZOaa	It was an absolute surprise for one, he never broke eye contact with me, it was raw and sincere, and I liked that he had asked for my parents blessing beforehand.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	It came from the heart|`|LVNbP6VWaa	He told the restaurant he was going to do it and they brought a plate with chocolate 'congratulations' writing and fruit on it.  It made it that bit more special! Good Luck x    PS I hope the lucky girl isn't reading any of these answers because it will spoil the surprise!

As long as you feel she is the girl you really want to be with, the one you love, then I think it's alright. A close friend (girl) of mine started dating a guy when we were 11. They've been dating each other for about 8 years. It was a little weird in the beginning, but then we (her group of friends) understood they were good together.    Hope this helps,  EnviousAdam|`|HzevoVflaa	A lot depends upon how mature you are in your emotional development, and if you are able to handle the crap that can come from others, especially jealous guys.  If you can handle that, and also behave in a reasonable manner, then go for it, but remember, rejection and break ups can hurt like hell, even for us older guys.  Good luck,  Mike t.
ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	That sounds like a dodgy explanation... like he's attributing his own feelings to you and then saying he therefore left for your benefit, but really it was for his own.    Let's try changing a couple pronouns:    "He said that he was afraid that his feelings for me weren't as strong as he thought they were because I was his first and, maybe he needed to experience other women."    This makes way more sense.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	it sounds to me like he doesn't want to be alone.  you are familiar to him and probably his ego wants to know if he can still have you.  don't go backwards learn from the past and move forward don't give him an opportunity to do this to you again.  find someone who will treat you the way you deserve to be treated, with love and respect.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Don't go back to him. It seems like he only cares about himself and only his feelings. The fact that he mentioned that he thought you should see other men, pretty much means in guy terms that he wants to experience other women so he won't feel as bad if you experience other men. Yes, you still love him, but until this guy shows you that he actually cares about YOUR feelings, don't get back involved with him.|`|AA10798898	I would say he's gonna tell you exactly what you want to hear right now. He's is most def rebounding you....typical man.|`|acxgIMviaa	dont have sex till marriage and you will see.
JPBh5WT3aa	I am so sorry.  That is a terrible thing to go through.  I can't even imagine how horrible this is for you.  I am by far no expert, but I have a friend that lost two of her sisters under tragic circumstances.  It has been 20 + years and she still feels enormous grief.  Through all the grief, and I have listened to years of it.......she is inspirational to me.   She ALLOWS herself to feel the grief, and acknowledges it, and still lives productively.  She doesn't beat herself up for not moving on...because she knows she never will.  This was her heart that was ripped from her when she lost her sisters.      One of her sisters was an artist, she photographed and painted.  So, my friend decided one day that she would take some classes to "be close" to her sister, and now she has found a hobby in photography that brings her great joy.  She never imagined she would like it, and now she is soooo good at it......she is winning awards and having shows.      I think. like my friend,  this is grief that you will carry with you forever.  Sometimes it will be easier, sometimes it will be harder.  If you can find someway to feel that "closeness" to your sister here on earth, I think it will help.  In the meantime, I would go to a counselor that deals specifically with grief.  Not only have you lost a sister, you lost a family all at once.  That is enough to bring anyone to their knees....and would have the strongest of us not able to move ahead.      Best of luck.  My heart goes out to you.|`|3Se5nlJtaa	This is one that is never easy to answer. The thing is remember the good times you had together. Try to find things that you enjoy now and concentrate on those but don't forget the things you did with your sister. I am sorry this has happened. Good Luck
b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You can always sue anyone for anything for any reason at any time. The biggest challenge is do you have enough of a case to persuade the courts to go in your favor, or in other words; win. You may need any witnesses or any paperwork to prove your case but at least you can try. You may have to remember the exact dates and times and things said if this was only verbal. This may sound hard but its not impossible. Keep records of anything you paid for that he said he would for the courts and any new addresses and work locations for him currently. Then take him to small claims court and go for it. You dont necessarily need to have an attorney for this as you can explain your case to the Judge and let them decide.

NmLMUOkXaa	Why would you want to be with someone that you can't trust to be there when things get bad? In the heat of a fight sometimes you do need time alone to cool off, but for someone truly committed to you this doesn't mean packing up and leaving you instead of addressing the issues. Sounds like this is his technique to get out of actually dealing with things that upset you. By running away, he gets to be the victim, you end up calling him begging him to come back which is exactly what he wants to hear, and I'm guessing that by the time he comes back all is forgiven until the same problem rears it's ugly head again. In a working relationship there is talking, compromising and a resolution to the problems in the relationship. Running away isn't an option, the problems will still be there when he gets back, and all he's accomplished is putting off dealing with them for a little while longer. Find yourself someone who will be there for you no matter what, and that is man enough to face problems head on, instead of running away like a little boy. It sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do, and enabling him won't help.    As for giving him a taste of his own medicine, it's up to you whether or not you're ready to move on, because there is always a chance that he won't persue you. Personally I'd say make a list of what you need in a partner and don't be willing to settle. If he wants to come back fine, but let it be on your terms as he is the one who abandoned you. He's going to keep leaving if he knows that it will always be easy to come back, so don't make it easy. Text him back and tell him it's obvious he's not ready for a relationship, and move on. You can definately do better.|`|kItRaRmlaa	yes u shud      but leave him 4eva      ur wasting ya life|`|GmTMVmASaa	personally, hell yea! he doesn't have the right to play with your emotions like that, no one does. i would tell mr. it's do or die baby, cause life is too short for all this wishy washy kind of love.  ignore him, or move on, but do show him you are not a toy and that your heart is real.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Ignore him forever.

Find someone new if you want to. Just take care of yourself and your daughter. If he wanted to be with you or want you in his life, he would act as so. When you're in a relationship, it's very important to communicate and compromise. if necessary, to really make the relationship work, you might have to sacrifice some things. If he isn't willing to do anything possible to make the relationship work and help keep you and your in a home of your own, then he isn't worth it.
IYF4xSTdaa	the same reason I would get mad if my husband would say to me ..who is a silly girl,yes you are...twisting face...  I don't like it and won't do it..|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	Because she forgets to feed me Scoobie snacks and give me tummy tickles.  Or because she forget to wear a corset while she puts a leash on me.  Or because she is not actually my wife, thus who the hell does she think she is to talk to me in such a manner.      _()_|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	I know, I don't get it.

That thought alone about having a tumor should make you appreciate him more right away. I'm being totally serious here.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	On one hand I would wonder what strange experiments those aliens done on him when he was abducted but then on the other hand he sounds pretty typical male strange!|`|UBdiyHu5aa	A chihuahua??<br>  I think this ***** is begging for someone to kill him and end his misery.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Wow I never heard of a man maturing before a female before! lol <br>  Hes nearing 40, he could be going through an early mifd life crisis|`|4wkIOVDoaa	Talk to him that's all.

You both have your own 'things' you both like different things, and have different ways of going about doing stuff and that's natural - I don't think it'd be very healthy if you got on amazingly well all the time, though I know that's not very helpful. <br>  <br>  I'm in the same kind of relationship now (though i think most people are after a year or so), you've probably got, in a way, bored of all the good things about each other, the novelty has worn off and now you're really noticing the annoying bits ... he'll be doing the same with you.<br>  <br>  I think all you can do is remember why you're together, sit down and talk to each other about these little pet hates, and either try to iron them out or learn to just put up with/accept them.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, they're all traits of the person you love (assuming you do) and you have to take the rough with the smooth, like everything in life.
2EobcGqqaa	A picture of anyone in a coffin is offensive that's for sure.  However, I doubt she did this to aggravate you.  Although I don't personally know her.  It sounds more like your sister hasn't completely dealt with the deaths of your parents. Maybe this is a way she is coming to closure with the situation.  Also I don't know what the beef between you and your sister is, but maybe you should try and get into contact with her.  Family should always forgive and stick together no matter what the situation might be.  If you have each other to lean on, then it might possibly help the whole family heal.  If she then chooses not to be a part of the family, then at least you could tell her that you find the pic on the website offensive.|`|z98RlStyaa	the only thing you can do is complain as inappropriate<br>  there should be a button by the picture after you click it<br>  <br>  other than that the only other way you can get it off<br>  is by confronting her about it.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	I agree with Jen  families should forgive each other for the mistakes they made.  i dint think your sister did that to aggravate you  maybe she deals with grief in that way. we all deal with grief differently<br>  some put pictures of deceased relatives some yell or scream. so i would ask your sister why did she put the picture on myspace and tell her that it is hurtful to you<br>  <br>  sorry about your parents they will always be with you|`|2SKd9996aa	Unfortunately Myspace likely will not remove the picture. Because she is her mom as well, she has a right to post the picture.
W1rCsvTzaa	You sound like a wonderful wife/future mother.  <br>  1. How old are you and he?  <br>  2. Is there a reason to rush to create 4 babies?  <br>  3. Are you in a very strong financial position?<br>  <br>  Did your husband tell you about his desire for (4 in 4) before you married?  <br>  <br>  This is a vastly important decision for your family.  Have you thought about sitting down and listing the pros and cons of (4 in 4), (4 in 10), etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a66nvk0taa	Siobhan plenty of deaf people have hearing children. in not always the case if a parent had a disability that the child will also have a disability.|`|AA11391968	Look at how brilliantly you communicate.   Childrens minds are free and clear to learn so rapidly.  Talk to your doctor about percentages with regard to your potential children and your concerns.  I do agree with you about not having four in four.  I think you should have one child and see how you feel and how your child is.  Four and four is to much to place on someone in a row like that.  Not to mention, it is not good for your physical health to have four in four years.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	as a friend i wish i could just give you a big hug.. but you will be great with kids .. dont worry mate|`|oeEsnwSMaa	talk to him|`|X7i59NeIaa	Tell him to relax and let nature take it's course. You will have a child when the time is right. You are not in a hurry as you have the rest of your lives to create a family. Don't worry about your child not being able to understand you or speaking people. He/she will be able to do both. I have a friend whose parents are both deaf and mute. She chats very well with them and has no problem in the speaking world. As far as the 4 in 4. I think he may change his mind after he sees just how much work one is. At any rate you can have your Dr. tell him how bad that would be for you. Good luck and stand your ground.|`|4b549d4bc0ac750fe8f337b80f76271baa	I would just sit down and tell him how you feel that you are not ready for babies right now, that you are unsure of yourself and maybe you can talk to someone about your feelings, you sound a little scared about raising a baby with sign language. Just be honest with him, that's always the best way to go. I've been married for over 25 years, Iknow honesty is the best when it comes to thigs like these, he loves you he'll listen.|`|po85q148aa	Just let him know you don't think you are ready right now.  But I really don't think you should worry about communication.  If anything your child(ren) will have an even better opportunity of socializing.  Not only will they learn to speak like their father, but they will know sign language from their mom as well.  I think that's awsome.  It would be just like any other child that has picked up on two languages.  Don't beat yourself up about it.  Talk to your hubby and be honest.  If he really loves you he'll understand.|`|vRe6CwgEaa	My friends father is deaf and mute and he isn't deaf or mute but he knows how to sign fine and it has actually furthered him in life.  I don't think you should have 4 kids in 4 years though.  Talk to him.  If he loves you, he'll understand.|`|RH7K4rsmaa	You have answered your own question. You simply tell him that you are not ready for a baby right now. They are a huge responsibility and you can't put them back where they came from! Take your time. If he doesn't understand, you may have to speak to a counselor. Good luck!|`|1o3OqSioaa	You are not just a vessel for reproducing, you are a young woman with a heart and mind of your own. Never do something for someone else (even a spouse) just to please them, if it's not want you want to do. If you start now selling yourself short for him, it will only get worse as time goes on. You have to stand your ground now, or just go ahead lie down, and grovel at his feet. I'm not being a smart a**. I'm very serious here. Love is not enough in a relationship, it takes mutual respect, and admiration. If he loves you, he won't really expect you to do something that you are truly against. He will respect you for standing your ground, and he will love you more for being honest and respecting yourself. There's no hurry to have children, there's plenty of time to think about it, so what is his big rush? (Red flag on this play).|`|GHH1i6d3aa	As for your potential child's development, they shouldn't have any problems communicating.  If anything they would have an advantage, since children can learn sign language before they learn to speak. <br>  <br>  The 4 in 4 thing sounds ridiculous - I would not want to do that to my body or mind.  4 crying kids all biting and drooling on each other sounds like hell, and I love kids!  You should tell him how you really feel about kids, before he assumes that you're on the same page.  <br>  <br>  I think once you guys have 1 child (when you're good and ready), he'll see how silly 4 at once would really be.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	This is a completely reasonable situation for you not to rush into having kids.  Just try to explain to him your fears and your worries.  If he's the supportive husband he sounds like, he probably just does not see your side of the situation.  It's always harder to have children before you're ready.  Take your time and enjoy marriage and have the children when you're both ready.  Besides, the child will be a step ahead by being fluent in 2 languages.  It would better in the long run.  And plenty of physical touch and affection would let the child know you love them.  Don't let your fears keep you from having what you want.  Good luck!|`|YHcyuka3aa	A child needs care 24/7 and the fact that your a caring person and would be a loving parent has nothing to do with the fact you can not always hear. There are ways to solve that problem and I think your child would love you no matter what. However your question is one that is simple. Your husband is asking too much of you. Having a child is difficult on your body and even tho the first one would be ok, the second one would be another one plus tw, the third one another one plus three and so on. That's a lot of baby's for you  to take care of, you would almost need help 24/7 for 4.  The decision is not up to him 100%, its a decision that yu both need to make and be happy with. Children are forever and they do make a marriage completely different. I would tell him that the whole ideal scares you and that you don't feel comfortable being responsible enough or feel safe enough to have so many little ones at one time. You both need to be happy or it won;t work. good luck!|`|6v7Almqsaa	Your children will be able to communicate with you fine if you teach them right off the bat. You shouldn`t worrry about that. =)<br>  <br>  And also, it`s perfectly normal for you to be hesitant about having children. I`d say you should tell him how you feel, especially if he doesn`t have any issues with anger. The key here is communication with the person you`re going to spend your life with. 4 children ARE a lot especially in 4 years so I don`t blame you for wanting to have that many. Just tell him how you feel & go from there.|`|2tzn6Ad9aa	Just tell him the truth. Say your just not ready yet, because children will put a strain on you. You should also tell him that you will let him know as soon as you are ready. Tell him that you would appreciate it if he sees it from your side of the story, and yeah...Im sure he would understand since you would be doing most of the work for taking care of the babies.<br>  <br>  as for the sign language thing, dont worry about it. Children can learn multiple languages at once when they are under the age of 7...you teach your kids sign language and they can get language from their environment and other people
aZwr6ck8aa	Dude you don't need a girlfriend, they are a waste of money bro.  Take the words of Motley Crue-Nikki Sixx says it best: "Chicks=Trouble".  Focus on school and making yourself better and girls will flock to u and then at that point if you want one go for it.  Girls are nothing but trouble and waste of money stay single!!!!  Until your old and grey then get someone to settle down with.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Maybe because you look like a 12 year old Jack Dawson?|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Hate to break it to you but your story doesn't add up.

Try not being a panzy|`|tY4hOjqdaa	During College I met girls at the parties or at the bar, either local or distant. Also, try the coffee or tea cafe in the area - bring ur computer. I always see opportunity to engage with another. Remember, you have to be the initiator here. Don't expect girls to be throwing themselves at your feet - even if ur a hot guy. I learned the hard way long ago when I was graduating from high school and going to what we called "tassel pulling parties." Where many girls were coming up to me and pulling mine and giving a kiss. I was like where the hell were u all year? These girls all were hot for me and I never got the clues. The lesson here is be observant and notice the clues if there is interest and be confident but not cocky in ur vibe.|`|QTjnxatraa	I think everyone goes through this and wonder what is wrong with them.  I reckon you should just continue to kick back and take it easy, these things will just fall in place with time.  I am a great believer in fate and that what should happen will.  <br>  <br>  I know 20 is feeling kinda old to ya but Honey, you are just a baby, you have plenty time.  Enjoy being single while you can, get to know you and what makes you happy.

If you want to snag a girl, be ultra-super confident, as if you own the world and you can get any girl you want.  THAT is what draws them in by the hoards!!!  Really!<br>  If you approach girls with extreme confidence(only do this after you have been acting super confident in your everyday life for at least 2 months) they will love it.<br>    And sometimes girls just like it for guys to initiate conversation, thats all it takes.|`|x2bTvscWaa	hey im only a little girl, but not too little, but i may help u. It is strange to me why u don't have a girlfriend. U seem very confident about yourself, and all of the traits u said u have are great. But what about the bad traits you don't know about that only girls or guys (whatever is your opposite gender) can see? U see i have a guy friend, and i asked him about the other guy that i liked. I asked him why maybe the person i liked didn't like me back? My friend (who is a guy) told me that i was loosing my cool in front of him whenever i spoke to the person i liked. I thought i was so good with guys...but maybe not. this is what u want to look for. there has to be a reason. so, if u have a friend or friends how are girls, or guys, ask them what they find unattractive and what others might find unattractive that YOU DON"T see.|`|uDl5lUtdaa	Jack Dawson!? ..marry me?<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously though, I think it just takes time really.  I don't think there's any tricks to it...I could say to go to more parties/clubs and socialize with different girls there, but you want a "nice, calm and loving girl", not some bar-hopping sack of STDs, so I think you just have to wait for her to come to you..<br>  <br>  and just an FYI: cute, young, nice college boys don't stay single for long..you'll find someone eventually!|`|VpiXyro8aa	a lot of girls love it when you can make them laugh and just be nice if you're all these adjectives youre describing yourself as idk why you don't have one|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	be yourself. When u see the girl that fits, make your move. <br>  <br>  Don't look for a girlfriend. Just be cool about it. You will get one soon enough.

Good luck...|`|hFLQras6aa	you're just tooting your own horn, obviously you don't have all those traits thats why you don't have a girlfriend?|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Maybe You look older because you have a greasy mustache or a beard or something which makes you look older|`|ahjOfnIIaa	I think if you open up and you're honest, then the right girl will see who you really are and fall head over heels for you...the key unfortunatly is patience :)<br>  <br>  good luck Sweets <br>  xxoo|`|Th0Znuf7aa	well, maybe you should try getting around, like maybe going to get togethers or parties maybe? I think its starts off as a friendship at first so find some great girl friends and hopefully, probably, one of them will be that special one. i dont really think there is a trick to getting a girlfriend. maybe you need to wait a little. i dont think you should worry too much about it, you sound like a pretty cool guy to me, i think you should just wait, like i said. also, maybe you need to make the first move? is that it? idk but good luck! hope my answer helped you :]|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Well, try just not trying and let things happen naturally.

You think a gf will fall into your arms out of the sky?|`|FLeEdSTxaa	Apparently, you're unattractive. I mean.. If you're as great as you say you are, there's no reason for anyone to turn you down....

You can't just expect girls to come to you. You need to take advantage of the situation and go for them.<br>  <br>  It boils down to simple human thinking. They want you to play their game, not necessarily the opposite.<br>  <br>  Of course all women are different. So the first step in finding a girlfriend for a solid relationship would be determining who you want to date. Don't flirt with every girl you see. Than pursue her and her alone. Remember to be persistent, but not annoying. And, most importantly, be yourself around her so she knows who you are.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful,<br>  Mix Masta J|`|YG288fG4aa	Mayeb if you didnt come off as gay with the Leonardo DeCaprio picture|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	ok here's my advice for you (though i'm a lot younger, i don't think girls change that much):<br>  <br>  - yes, good looks make us look again. they help, but they're not everything.<br>  - don't try to impress us, and losing your cool in front of us seriously doesn't matter. in fact, if you do, then we might see you as vulnerable, and a lot of girls like sensitive, vulnerable guys.<br>  - if a girl wants to talk, LET HER TALK. that's one of the best qualities in a guy, and ACTUALLY LISTEN. if she wants your opinion, give it. don't just make her feel good.<br>  - try to be able to have an actual conversation sometimes, don't stay shallow. girls get attached to guys who they can spill their secrets to, especially if the guy actually cares.<br>  - if you're looking for a relationship just for the physical part, good luck finding a long-term girlfriend.<br>  - just love her back. don't pretend. sounds like you'd be a good boyfriend like you say if you're nice and funny and serious. girls like that kind of guy. <br>  <br>  good luck! just don't act too cool to try to attract girls. be yourself, thats all that matters.|`|hAH0fmhVaa	Dont try so hard.<br>  And stop analyzing it. Makes it worse.|`|fV2RBwIJaa	Maybe it's just a confidence issue because you're analyzing too much? Just keep looking..you'll find someone eventually.
UfhE3k1baa	Not at first. We did not get along at all. To be honest, they are controlling, manipulative and judgemental.<br>  But, and I know this is weird, we have made a peace I think. I know they love my husband, and in their own way, they want to do what is best for him. My mother in law can be very helpful, she is there for us when we truly need it. My father in law is funny, and pretty nice to me most of the time. <br>  With in laws I learned you just have to except them, I would never hurt my husband by forcing them out of our lives. I just take their comments with a grain of salt and move on. He loves me and married me and we are having a baby, basically, I am not going anywhere, so "fighting" for my position does not make any sense.|`|FgRUdQOBaa	I dont have either any more. <br>  They were divorced and I had to go through that whole thing with my wife and her sisters but they were both always great to me and the kids.<br>  My father in law was my foreman on my first "real job" out of high school and we became great friends.<br>  My Mommy in law always told my wife if we ever got divorced she would side with me LOL. <br>  Even when she was getting frail and her health was failing the kids would go one at a time and spend the weekend with her, they were small and really looked forward to the weekends with Gramma. <br>  I'm grateful we were close enough for the kids to spend a lot of time getting to know all their grandparents before they passed away, it is so very important for kids to see every part of life and not be protected from it.|`|DS21ekeJaa	Even tho I am divorced, my inlaws are still "Mom" and "Dad" to me! My MIL is funny, giving, warm hearted, but also a bit opinionated and definitely likes to see the best in her children. My FIL is the organizer and the believer in right or wrong and has a strong sense of loyalty. <br>  We had a period after the divorce where things were very strained and painful, but we got through it and are great friends and even go on vacation together with my kids.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Both very much.

YG288fG4aa	There's nothing you can do just from now on give your complete self to the relationship, if he cant do that too then it may not work, but if you both really love each other you will find a way to make it better but it will take time. My boyfriend and i broke up for a couple months and realized we still love each other and got back together it took a couple weeks for us to be ourselves again but it was worth it and now we communicate more.|`|AA10974198	If he says he still loves you and would like to get back together then surely there isn't a problem there?<br>  <br>  Edit: Then just tell him exactly how you feel and if he really does love you then he shouldn't really be mad. idk if he's still mad you need to ask him what the problem is or it's not going to work anyway|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Why in the world would you break up with a guy you can't get over and that expresses love for you? This is beyond me.|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	No rude answers?  Will an honest answer be ok then?<br>  <br>  You said, "i kinda told my boyfriend i wanted to break up".    Really?  How do you "kinda tell someone" that you want to break up? <br>  <br>  Also,  did you have a reason for wanting to break up with him?   I'm thinking you did have at least one reason for wanting him gone.  What happened?   Did this reason magically go away?<br>  <br>  You've said you've apologized 90,000 times  (I highly doubt you've said, "i'm sorry" that many times,  but I do get your point).  I have a question of my own,... why do you feel the need to apologize so much to him?   What did you do that your not telling us?<br>  <br>  Seems to me you should re-post your question.   Only THIS time, state WHY you broke up with him in the first place and WHY your feeling the need to apologize so many times.
oHuhTJPwaa	Neither woman should be hung because of the mental and physical trauma that they have suffered. When a women fears for her life she couldn't possible think clearly and sometimes doesn't see any way out of the situation but resorting to murdering her husband. I still don't agree with murdering a spouse because who wants to be beat all those years then spend the rest of their lives in prison. I would rather see her kill him right before a beating or after. Forensics are so good now in days that they would be able to tell if she planned this murder or not. This could mean the difference between first degree and 2nd.|`|29ef3b425c997be8f850f8ab0a765cfcaa	Battered Women syndrome<br>   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battered_woman_defence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battered_wo...</a><br>  <br>  Any woman who finally gets the guts to do this should be applauded for putting the sicko in a grave and not in jail|`|iD4ejChZaa	When a woman is 'continously abused', she begins to lose her mind. <br>  Her mind becomes controlled, she doesn't see the world like other people do. Women are soft, with breasts, we are not meant to be punched or kicked, like guys fighting in street gangs. We internalise and either make ourselves throw up, over eat, or drink, etc. we do anything but hurt him back. Finally a woman snaps. She just wants to stop the abuse, she knows if she stops it then no longer can he come at her. Of course it is not moral or legal, but it is rational, in a way.<br>      No she should not be put to death, when she was being physically abused her mind was also being abused, she lost any sense of self worth. Years of cronic abuse ? he deserved what he got, as for the 27 y.o.'s case- she should have called the police then moved away.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Berrie, no matter how, our opinion are purely only good on earth.<br>  Things might still have to be answer, whether we are in hell or heaven.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, do you remember the movie about '' ENOUGH '' by Jennifer<br>  Lopez ?<br>  As she struggle to be abused by her abusive husband.<br>  Things either had to be planned out or we had to do it '' right ''.<br>  <br>  When comes to forensics, though you might be get away with it,<br>  but can you live to lied at yourself of guiltiness ?<br>  Even when the abuser dies, what good can we earn ?<br>  I always believe we live to show ourselves who we actually are, by that, I mean, how are we suppose to carry ourselves to show others,<br>  abusive ? violence ? cruelty ? and especially bullies.<br>  We had to '' find '' a right way '' TO SHOW '' others how do we gonna act<br>  in those intolerable cruelty of situations. If we can't, we will always submit to<br>  wrong doings and probably we will never be able to learn from our mistakes.<br>  And that's why we had so many human rights organizations to help us out,<br>  least we forget and couldn't find a way out.<br>  But ultimately killing will never be the answer unless we are in a self defense circumstances.<br>  So, if you had the proof that you had been batter or abused, you got no choice but to take everything to court and let the judge to define the situation and of course there are also judges to be bribe but we still cannot take people's life<br>  with our own hand.
YVeZ8K6haa	Yes, I have seen it! I loved it! It had such a great message and it really got my fiance and I looking at our relationship. Also, I got to meet Kirk Cameron at a church in FL he was speaking at. He is a very nice guy :]<br>  <br>  EDIT: You can also buy the book love dare! :]|`|KILFoc6kaa	My husband and I have been married for 7 years, watched the movie a couple weeks ago, it was very very moving, and helpful, even for us whom have been married for a while.

BW9ghd6uaa	Wow.. except for the time when you guys met, I was put in the exact same position, except I was Samantha.  <br>  <br>  We texted back and forth nonstop for a while and we said "i love you" and stuff. But completely like a brother/sister thing. He was my best guy friend too. Then he asked me out and I said yes. I thought about it for a while, and then I was like.. wow.. going out with him is so weird.  I didn't even like the guy that way.<br>  So now we barely text.  I try and avoid conversation with him (he doesn't go to my school).<br>  <br>  I would say, she's got the idea that you like her.  Tell her: I like you, but I think that you don't like me like I like you.  Which might ruin our friendship. And I'd rather keep the friendship than have things awkward between us. <br>  <br>  That may be enough to make things awkward, or she might just be cool about it. <br>  <br>  Either way, I think you like her more than she likes you.  But there are other fish in the sea!|`|RRzcbvvXaa	well you may be right that she "did" like you. maybe she was just waiting for you to make a move, and you never did so she moved on. i mean she could still like you, and just be saying that she likes someone else to make you jealous or make you wanna make a move on her. i guess if you told her you liked her and if she didnt reciprocate, then i guess she most likely doesnt like you. next time (if there is a next time, which im sure there will be with another girl) if you like her, tell her because it could be too late, and she will just end up moving on like this one did.|`|64oOqELCaa	wow wierd|`|K3gqlxonaa	Young man after that many text msgs, you'd think that you've done eough talking. Call her with the number and ask her if she has time to talk. Find out if she has other interest and if she says no, start doing something other than texting with her.|`|J4EVtMFtaa	texting is nothign start to talk on the phone|`|UKrSb081aa	Dude, I totally know how you feel. I've been in your situation before, and it sucks. When I liked a girl as much as you like this one, I told her, and it turned out that she didn't like me that way...which sucked. But at least I knew, and we're still really good friends. So just tell her how you feel - you'll feel way better to get it off your chest, and she might actually feel the same way you do.<br>  <br>  Okay, tell her the truth, don't sugar-coat it. Tell her you like her a lot, and you've liked her for a long time. If she laughs at you and doesn't want to be your friend anymore, (which I don't think she will) then she is not someone you want to be friends with.

Older men seem to be liked more by younger women too because of what they possess ex: cars, house(s), etc. That age gap is pretty big but this is the 21st century so anything really is fair game(18+,legally, that is!).

BW9ghd6uaa	On the topic of his depression: tell him to snap out of it. Slap him if necessary. Tell him it's worrying you like crazy. It's a sad thing that his uncle passed, especially before his time, but that's life. You move on.<br>  <br>  On the bf/gf situation: either break up with your bf or bury your feelings with this guy.  If you ask him to break up with his gf, people will think he is slumming.  Think higher of yourself than that.  But if you want to be together, you can't force each other to make the first move.

7VjhcEk8aa	Girl...Just about a Year ago I was in that same situation. We both loved to have sex and lots of it...All of the sudden he just stopped wanting to have sex with me....I just couldn't figure out what the deal was.....And he wouldn't talk to me about it either....So my gut feeling was he was cheating on me and sure enough one night when he was sleeping I checked his phone inside and out and found voice mails from some other chick....So get to snooping girl!|`|AA11391968	You mentioned that when you brought up your sex life to him that he basically told you to answer that question.  That was key for me.  I say this because he feels something occurred/changed with you that is causing him to shut you down sexually.  Have you mentioned any ex partners that he did not know about, etc?  He is hurting and being resentful toward you for some reason.  Often with Bi-Polar there are hi and lo long lasting moods.  Perhaps for a while there was alot of stress associated with the last time you to made love.  Give him a little time and then have a heart to heart so you both know where you stand, because that's an awful position to be in.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	This is so clear. He is Addicted to porn. This is very common in a relationship, specially when husbands/bfs have easy access to computer to watch porn. You need to confront him. He needs to stop watching porn and start paying attention to your needs.|`|bc9inzicaa	I understand...I a very similar situation.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Well something is wrong in bed and he knows it. Maybe there's not enough variation or something. But he needs to tell you because you can't fix a problem that you don't know exists. Either way he does it, he's hurting your feelings so he might as well come out with it so all can be satisfied with it.|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Believe it or not not all men have a high sex drive but you need to feel comfortable enough to talk to him about it. My hubby is the same way, it could be that he relates sex with disrespect and know that he is comfortable with you he doesn't want to disrespect you. This isn't all bad depending on how important sex is to you. But you have to tell him nicely that women have needs too!|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	1. you should have got to know what kind of a person he was.<br>  #2.

There is a big world out there, get out and see some of it.  I don't mean go hook up with someone else, I mean, get some other interests in life.  Sex is great but do you think it should be your everything?  Relationships are about so many other things.  Everybody goes through hot and cold times.  People get tired.  Porn is addictive, to be sure.  Probably easier and less effort involved than actually connecting with another.  If you want a deeper kind of person, you have to be a deeper person yourself.  How are you as a parent?  There's something else to think about.|`|l5UhvWqeaa	I'm not an expert on this but in my personal opinion, a relationship is more than just sex. Sex is just one of the components. What may be lacking is intimacy between the two of you. <br>  <br>  For the porn thing, it can never substitute for the real thing. Find some ways to spice up your sex life like trying different positions, place, scenario or whatever. Better talk to some counsellors on this.|`|oHuhTJPwaa	Remember sex isn't just an act but is very emotional. Something is definitely wrong tho. You might try planning a private night were you two can just have some time alone without kids and all. Have a drink or two to make the atmosphere relaxed and see if he is still into you. If he doesn't respond at all but gets irritated then you might want to move on to someone who will appreciate you. If he tells you the reason for the drastic change in him and still wants you, then you have a winner. Try not push to hard and don't let the evening end without some kind of answer. Remember if this guy has been in a lot of relationships this might be normal for him and he's just getting bored with you and wants to move on to the next girl. He will eventually get bored of her to.Commitment issues are real !!!!|`|rR6cWJDgaa	love languages.<br>  i dont know if you have ever heard about this but there are five main love languages and if i can remember them properly then they are:<br>  sexual<br>  physical<br>  spoken<br>  gifts..<br>   and<br>  i cant remember the other one<br>  <br>  your is obviouly sexual so you want that. you have to be able to speak your partners language. <br>  im not talking speak it physically but because your language is sex, then you want your partner to have sexual interations with you.<br>  say mine is gifts wich it isnt, then for my partner to speak to me he would ahve to buy me gifts.. <br>  <br>  maybe you could google it and try each different idea out.<br>  <br>  Have you tried foreplay? this usually works..<br>  and theres a website girlsaskguys that usually helps with these kinds of questions.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)
CD5JsjxKaa	WOW. it's almost like i wrote this question!! lol. But seriously, i went through this a little while back and it hurt. The rejection really hurts because men have this stereotype of "always wanting it" and it just seems strange and wrong when they don't want it. we feel like we've failed as women to arouse him and that somehow it's our fault that he doesn't want it. but i find that it's true about the 'being tired' part. exhaustion is the biggest libido buster. it drains men of all their desire and it really isn't his fault. REALLY!! it gets to a point that he just can't get himself to even WANT it, let alone DO it. it's not him rejecting you. trust me. <br>  what you need to do is get him to take a break. drag him away from work. tell him that this is a serious problem and it requires DRASTIC action. if he doesn't believe the gravity of it, tell him that you were even considering divorce. be honest. it's the best way. when he sees just how it's affecting your relationship he'll be more open to solving the problem. right now he's probably thinking "it's no big deal. women don't even LIKE sex, they only need it like thrice a year..." (female stereotyping). once he knows how serious it is then he'll be willing to act. get him to take a vacation with you or something, or start with something simple like not bringing work home or something... <br>  good luck!! don't give up until you've tried EEEEEverything...no regrets...|`|3MKHCgE3aa	They are many stages in a marriage and you are going through one.  don't throw in the towel yet.  Talk to your husband, let him know how you feel about him and how you miss the intimacy of sex with him.  Let him know you understand he's tired and see if there is anything you can do to help. You two need to go away for a weekend and spend some quality time alone getting reacquainted.|`|YHcyuka3aa	It can happen in a marriage where you can love someone but not be IN love with them. Your also not with him 100% of the time so you don't know what he does all the time. You have talked yourself into believing he wouldn't cheat on you but wake up, he will and probably is. For some reason he has lost interest. Ask him again. The be a detective and do some snooping. Do you know where he works? That's a start.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	No you have children! To many people bail on marriages these days. You took vows for better or worse. Why do so many people want a divorce? So have you asked him if he still finds you attractive? This is an odd situation for myself to comment on because my husband is on me 24/7. I could see a man saying this about his wife but what man wouldnt want sex? I would talk to him. You seem like you have an ok marriage. Maybe spice it up some. Dont give him the option to turn you down just pounce on him! Go get him Tom Cat style : )|`|TJezsCkHaa	When they are tired that would be the last thing they want to do,it takes a lot of energy.If you know he has no time to cheat AT ALL,don't worry then.He will come back when he is not tired.|`|AA10327722	He's probably just tired of the same old sex, spice it up a bit.  Wear some sexy lingerie or something unexpected.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	3 kids in 4 years !   Maybe he just feels overwhelmed, no energy, how is your economic situation currently ?|`|1O9jE4P2aa	Love changes on and off. Its not that he doesnt love you as his wife or that he only loves you as a friend. The longer your married or the longer you've been dating someone...the passion just goes....Ive been dating my boyfriend for 6 years. We may not have gone that long without sex but theres been months when i didnt want to but gave in. Give him more time. Sometimes people just need to catch up with their busy life. And who knows...maybe something is bother him. You can always ask. But dont be too pushy. Tell him that you feel he isnt attracted to you anymore. Tell him it hurts you. Its not just about the sex, its about the connection when you have sex and your not getting that important connection.|`|4ee0b1f9d55ec0600e38779c79520a9faa	Divorce is not the answer. This is just one aspect that needs to be worked on, so don't throw in the towel yet. He could just be tired or maybe there's something more. If he's not getting a healthy diet, that can definitely lower one's sex drive. There are also natural supplements that can boost libido; check your local GNC of health store.<br>  <br>  There's also the instance where there could be something emotional. You might want to seek some couple's counseling before filing for divorce.|`|VLwox49Saa	#1 There is no such thing as being too busy to cheat<br>  <br>  #2 If he loved you as a friend only then he must be loving someone else romantically.<br>  <br>  #3 or what is the most likely scenario, he has become impotent. Talk to him and see whats up fast.<br>  <br>  Changes like these are rarely good signs in a marriage going into the BIG 4 year mark.|`|29ef3b425c997be8f850f8ab0a765cfcaa	Life is like that,guess your turn is coming. Just because he isn't into having sex with you all the time does not mean he doesn't love you. There is far more important things in a marriage then sex. Honesty,respect ,Love.Friends is a great thing too.|`|CAKPLhTDaa	There's no need for divorce, tell him how you feel. He won't know if you don't approach him.<br>  Good Luck|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Talk to him about it. Tell him that not having sex is hurting your relationship. Try getting help, go take a small trip for the two of you, do something to try and fix it.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	There is no way that someone could suggest that you do get a divorce or you don't get a divorce with such little information. Only you and your husband can make that decision.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Do you know how many women complain about the opposite? About not having all the little romantic aspects that you do? Like someone else said, try a lot of things before you give up, but mostly put the effort into it. Show him this message! Men work on direct communication.|`|RtkB46peaa	Sweetie, most women would kill for your relationship.  The only problem is both of you have taken on way too much.  You both need to re-evaluate your priorities (literally), and find time for each other.  This is mandatory.|`|b2991299e50178a6760fb54b34c39b27aa	No.   Send the kids somewhere.  Drag him into the bath.  Have a relaxing conversation there.  Tell him you love him and want him.  When you get out the tub tell him you need to be taken.   Then tell him how good it was.   Even if it wasn't that good, say it.  You're just jump-starting things.  Once you get things going again, alway use positive words.  In other words, if he does A and you don't like it, don't say so.  Say, you'd really like if he would do B.  If it's a question of technique, say that you'd like it even better if he did it a little differently.<br>  <br>  Touch him everyday and let him know you desire him.  Flirting is always good even if you are married.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Your relationship can't be that "awesome" if all he does is kiss and touch, but no more.<br>  <br>  Dear, you have some serious marital problems. He needs to level with you, because HE KNOWS why he doesn't want to have sex anymore. HE knows, but for some reason, he feels that he can't tell you - you, who are his wife, the mother of his children and the one to whom he is supposed to be able to say anything.<br>  <br>  You know him best - so, what happened 6 months ago that might have been the catalyst for him changing his mind about jumping your bones? Is it possible that he doesn't want to have any more kids and he's afraid of getting you pregnant again? Do you think it could be that the reality of having 5 mouths to feed has hit him like a ton of bricks, and he really IS stressed and he's freaking out a little (or a lot?) Have you considered that maybe he's gay - and don't be so shocked. It happens all the time.<br>  <br>  If everything was hunky dory before 6 months ago, then SOMEthing happened then to change his attitude about sex. THINK ! What happened ?<br>  <br>  Start there, and best of luck. Don't ask for a divorce. Sex is important, but your kids deserve to be brought up in an intact home, and as long as he isn't destructive or abusive, divorce shouldn't be in your mind at all. This is the " ... for worse" part of your vows, so you have to do everything in your power (as should HE) to get over this rough patch.<br>  <br>  Start with examining your lives 6 months ago, and find a way to make him level with you. He owes you that much.<br>  <br>  Best of luck !

I mean you are probably young, unless you really like one particular guy, then just go for him, but you need to be aware that the relationship may not last that long. If you are cool with that then go for it.|`|x2bTvscWaa	it sounds like your in a tight situation. Guys think u are one of them. Maybe making yourself out to be something your not isn't the way to go. What you need to do is be true. if you are bothered by the way guys talk to u like u are one of them, start telling them your a GIRL. tell them that it is cool to hang and stuff, but if maybe u start to like one of them, just maybe drop a few, tiny hints. If you like make-up, go for it! but if it is only to get their attention for you being a GIRL, and u don't like it, then just don't put urself up to that kind of challenge! BE YOURSELF! :D|`|tY1gSfN4aa	well first of all, you seem like a really cool girl...just be more flirty n playful! n take some extra time to look nice everyday. use make-up n try to dress cute n all that...don't lose any of the qualities you have right now though, because they're all great. guys like a girl that they can talk to, like you! you just have to balance being the kinda girl they can talk to, with being the kinda girl they wish they get the chance to talk to lol.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I Like girls that are quiet but talkative when you start talking to them. I for reason love when girls playfully tease me and stuff. I however hate girls that are always screaming and drawing attention to themselves, they are annoying and not the kind of girl i would want|`|A9JV4uAxaa	Well since im a guy i may know, personally what i look for in a girl first is her personality, that is key, i want her to not be like me, that just gives us more to talk about. The second thing is style. I personally like just the typical girl clothes, flannels are a huge no no in my opinion, also baggy jeans. Finally is there friends, if shes hanging out with only guys, i would stay away, because that says a lot about who she is. In my opinion who you hang out with says a lot about who you are, so maybe try hanging with more girls.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Guys like boobs, butts and legs mostly.<br>  <br>  However guys do mature (eventually) and will like someone<br>  <br>  who can be there for them, someone easy to talk to, someone who can<br>  <br>  cook, and someone who has compassion for them on their tough days.<br>  <br>  Do you like one of these guys who text you?|`|NSwkUNb1aa	well some guys like to be hit, haha, anyway, your guy friends probably noticed the change, hell a few of them probably like you, can't really tell need more info|`|l6AmmoJAaa	who knows girl. I have that problem all of the time. just wait and be yourself. it is hard, believe me, but you will be thankful you did in the end.|`|MpTgh6MMaa	i think tkay answered it best. dont waste your time on them if they cant see your true beauty. oh, and don't change your image for them. Have your image because it was the one you chose.|`|Dt3t6KwHaa	First and Foremost, DON'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE.  If guys aren't paying attention to you as you are, then they aren't worth your time.|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	ya a little. lol|`|AQSWJJcxaa	Actullay all of us are looking for girl who is feminise by look and always wear the clothese that add some more glamour in her look.<br>  <br>  As u have mentioned they treat u like guy's this means u might show your dominance over others like males do and alos most of time wear clothes which gives u male look. Try to avoid these things ultimately every body will start treating as a girl.|`|MpOfAWPyaa	i personally like a girl that is athletic, smart, funny, can take a joke, pretty and doesn't get into trouble. I personally don't like a girl to be rough.|`|dsF1aWbjaa	What guys look for in a girl is;<br>  <br>  1. Attractive<br>  2. Confident?<br>  3. Flirty?<br>  4. Friendly?|`|AmatPReMaa	YES I AM LIKE GUYS GIRL AND TALKING WITH YOU
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	I think when any relation steps to the part that they share everything, love each other, and plan their future together, this is marriage, its not about the papers and legal papers its about what they really feel toward each other.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	My sister used to say that 'only puppies need papers' referring to marriage certificate. My point, is, if this couple feel it's real, if they feel that they are married by way of spiritual vows to self and God, then that is their reality. It may not hold any legal value, but eventually it could be made 'legal'.<br>  <br>  Some might say that this is a verbal contract and that could be legally binding.<br>  <br>  Age was not considered during the course of this discussion. Should it be?|`|zguucR8yaa	The state won't recognize it as a marriage. But to the couple, it's very real.|`|SAMRKyZsaa	in the eyes of the government not a real marriage.  They can't do anything legally that maried people enjoy.  (putting on insurace, right to property, if they have a child before the state has it the parents will be listed as not married ect\<br>  <br>  Now in my opinion they are married even if the government does not reconise it
