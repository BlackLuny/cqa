HFcFU6OYaa	That is actually a manufacturer issue. Technically you only have 30 days for an exchange, but I would contact LG with details (include upc, copy of receipt if you have it) and see if they will replace it. Usually if you throw a big fit they will send you to the retentions department...they usually bend over backwards to keep customers.
1YS1hFQFaa	I love PC gameplay because you can customise interface better and depending on your sistem have better graphics|`|XMy5hyJ1aa	PC hands down, you have much more control over everything, and the controls are more... expanded lets say. Instead of 2 sticks, a D-pad and like 5 buttons, you have a mouse with un-restricted movement, and a whole keyboard. Also you can have music in the background, you know your machine inside and out so if something goes wrong YOU can fix it not some guy in India, and if you feel like it you can hack the game and have much more fun.

hJP9y6kjaa	No, bass won't reduce...<br>  <br>  Noise sucks. It can come from any number of places. I'd start at the amp and work my way back, testing each signal component for how much noise it adds to the system.<br>  <br>  The three biggest culprits of noise are bad power, emi interference, and too much gain. Gain is easiest - lower it. Never use more gain than you absolutely need, since every time you add gain you add some more noise to your signal.<br>  <br>  Bad power and related issues like ground loops can be major players in the game, too. The big thing to look for are non-isolated power outlets... in other words, get a decent quality power strip. A decent quality power conditioner would be ideal, but isn't always within the budget. A cheap power conditioner won't do anything significant for you! So try separate power adapters, and listen to the noise when you plug in different pedals. Sometimes its a pedal issue, sometimes its a power strip issue, sometimes its an issue with the noise from the wall.... there's always a solution to each, but you have to find the problem first.<br>  <br>  Ah  yes, and interference. Ideally you want a low-z signal coming out of your guitar... pickups are high impedance, and that signal is more susceptible to noise. Fix it with a buffer, either onboard or in the form of the first pedal in your chain (onboard is better) or have some form of active fx in your guitar... either active pickups or a preamp.<br>  <br>  Interference is a real bish. It can come from lights, computers, appliances, your amp, and yes, even you. Proper grounding and shielding is essential, especially in a high-gain rig. Your whole issue could revolve around your environment shooting loads of noise into your system.... so a good diagnostic strategy is to take your rig out of its normal environment and see if that does anything. You also don't want to play your guitar close to the amp - that's a guaranteed way to get noise, even with shielding and grounding!<br>  <br>  I'm not a big fan of using a noise suppressor... but if you do, try putting it in the fx loop, anywhere else it isn't going to have as much of an impact.<br>  <br>  I don't know anything about your setup, what type of pedals you're running, what amp you're using, what your environment is, or what type of sound you're going for.... so this is really all I can give you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|5bq2Viixaa	I had this but simply turning bass up will reduce|`|AA11061397	To prove whether or not it is the power adapter, temporarily connect a 9V battery instead.  Use one which is designed for a lantern, not a PP9 sized one. <br>  <br>  If that clears up the hum then you need to try a different adapter.  <br>  <br>  Hum can also be caused by a faulty cable, particularly an unconnected shield.  Try substituting cables to check this possibility.
5bq2Viixaa	Depends on the warrenty|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Depends where you bought it.

I8yV5Hglaa	I usually buy music on iTunes, because it's cheaper and more convenient.<br>  <br>  However, I do occasionally buy albums in stores, but only if they are about the same price as on iTunes.|`|gSGk78dtaa	well i would get it on itunes only because i don't have to pay for it plus you can get livewire and your itunes just swicth over without pay. <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. the reason why i chose this answer because i am a very cheap person|`|Ipqr3nbLaa	Easier to get it on itunes just because you don't have to get off the computer but i would rather get in on a CD so yo can play it in a car or move it from place to place easily.   Yes ... you can burn in onto a Cd but your going to need to get the cd for that which cost money... if you are at a store and see that album you want get it but dont go out of your way and if you really want it now get it on itunes and you can always burn a cd.
162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	The camera may be a grey market, as I noticed no where did the ad say USA.  That means Nikon will not work on it,  period, under warranty or not.  The third party warranties are sometime OK, and sometimes very problematic.<br>  <br>  Also the add on  lenses are  pure junk.     The tripod cheap and flimsy.  The SD card a cheap and probably inferior brand.  Sandisk and Lexar SD cards are inexpensive, why buy an unknown brand?  The prices for the extra stuff are highly inflated.<br>  <br>  At www.bhphoto, the D80 and two Nikon lenses are  $819.95 USD with free shipping.  The D80 with the 18-135 kit lens is $749.95.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	I wouldn't try a 100 watt converter on a 1200 watt device.  The best way to go would be a transformer such as the one at the link below.  It's rated at 1500 watts and will handle your coffee maker.  Unfortunately, when you get into this power range the price does go up.  Unless you really like the coffee this maker produces it may be more cost effective to buy a US coffee maker.  Maybe you can find the US version of the same brand.  You should also make sure the circuit you plug this coffee maker into can handle the load.  <br>  ADDED TO ANSWER MORE DETAILS<br>  I'm not sure what you mean by "hold up to 1500 w".  You can't hold watts.  Watts is a measurement of power and is measured in amount used, not amount an appliance can hold.  The max means that it is the maximum the appliance will use.  It can use less.  The pot will use the most energy when first brewing a pot of coffee and heating the cold water.  When the coffee is finished brewing and the pot is just keeping it warm it may use less.  There's no reason to list the maximum usage as more than it actually uses at it peak.  <br>  Watts are the applied voltage times the current used.  At 220 volts, 1500 watts (you first give 1200 watts but I'll stay with your last number) means your drawing 6.82 amps.  To get the same power at 120 volts the coffee maker will have to draw 12.5 amps.  This is about the maximum you can draw from a typical US household circuit before you have to worry about the fuse blowing or the circuit breaker tripping.

HTXbLqBIaa	Hi,<br>  Obviously there's something wrong with your tv's amplifier. Its probably sending out way too much power to the speakers. Instead of using the speaker connection use the audio line outputs (RCA jacks L and R) on the tv to recieve audio to an external amplifier. An external amplifier could be your sound stereo. Your stereo should have RCA jacks L and R inputs. So connect the tv and the stereo with L and R stereo RCA audio cable. Then turn both the stereo and the tv on. Keep the tv volume in the middle. Now go to the tv's menu and change it from tv's internal amp to external amp (select with remote). Now the tv speaker has no power so you'll be able to get full power to stereo speakers. Now you have to select your stereos line input using the stereo remote and now you should be able to hear the tv through your stereo's speaker. Adust the volume level of the stereo to the level you like. <br>  So if you do not have a stereo with line inputs, I would suggest that you go and get a pair of powered computer speakers (the real cheap ones) and plug them into your tv's headphone out. To do this, power the computer speakers by plugging them into an power outlet, keep the volume to low on the speakers. Now, plug the 1/8 inch mimi jack to tv's headphone out jack and keep the tv's volume to very low. Now you should be able to hear the tv through the computer speakers. You can ajdust the volume level by using either the tv or the computer speakers. Remeber, the tv's internal amplifier must be selected for the headphones to work. The only time you change it to external amp is if you want to use the L and R outs.<br>  Hope this will work and Good luck!

o7xgWWGiaa	There is an action game called TMNT based on the recent TMNT movie of the same name.  It's decent, but meant for newcomers to the action genre.<br>  <br>  There is a new TMNT fighting game for Wii in development, titled TMNT: Smash Up.  It is being developed by Team Ninja (of Dead or Alive fame) and Game Arts (developer of Super Smash Bros. Brawl).  It looks incredible so far, but you'll have to wait till the 2nd half of 2009 for it.  Anyhow, keep it on your watchlist.|`|gBkBZNJOaa	right now i'm pretty sure there isn't but a new game just got announced from the creators of smash bros. that actually looked decent.<br>  <br>  i just checked. the release date for the new "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up" is fall 2009 though i wouldn't be surprised if it was delayed.|`|My0D4lmVaa	Nope. <br>  But one IS coming later this year - TMNT : Smash Up!, is effectively Super Smash Brothers, with the Turtles. It's even developed by the same team.

AA12323486	Deleting pictures off your cellphone is easy!  Go to the picture and look at menu options for what you can do with the picture.  Deleting should be in there.  The hard part is deleting them off your friend's phone and any of their friends' phones they might have sent them to.  Oh yes, and once they're online, they will show up on computers everywhere.  Best to never ever send anyone nudes EVER!  Got that?  In fact, it's best to never take nudes of yourself on your cellphone.  Did you see tonight's episode of 30 Rock?

JGD15fQOaa	I have rockband for the wii and for the drums, microphone, guitar/bass, and game all together was a little more than $180. I'm not sure how much the drums are by themselves. I do know that the guitar/basses are a little more than $70. I think the best way to go would be to save up about $200 so you can get the set. Then save up again after you buy that and get the other guitar because the set comes with only one guitar. Honestly, I think that you should get it for the x-box 360 because it's got all of the same songs but you can create your own character, it's a bit harder to unlock songs, and you can buy more songs on it. You can't do any of those on the wii one so it sucks real bad and it's a waste of money honestly. It's the same price for all of the things on the x-box 360 as the wii.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	the Special Edition bundle (that's the game plus drums, mic, and guitar) costs $200|`|gBkBZNJOaa	the game comes with drums mic and 1 guitar (it should be two for the bass and guitar but unfortuantely it's only one) for $189.99 at any retail store. online used you could maybe get it in good condition for 150 bucks. idk i haven't really checked.<br>  <br>  the drums alone cost 79.99. with tax the total came out to a little under 205 dollars if i remember correctly. call your local gamestop to ask any more questions you might have.|`|PPdGBFPNaa	Your best bet would not be going to ebay or any of those betting sites.

ORGIk7Vkaa	You need a sidekick plan for all the functions on your phone to work properly. My daughter had one and without the sidekick plan every time she would power her phone up the contacts would not be on the phone. She would have to manually go into the settings every time to import them back from the sim card. The sidekick is mainly good for texting and web use anyway so you might want to reconsider if your not into that because the data plan is about $24.99 now without minutes. Boost mobile has unlimited minutes, texting and web for $50 dollars a month prepaid with no contract just in case your interested.

AA10341097	no that is normal, whatever you do, DO NOT attack a big daddy unless it has a little sister with him because you would basically be attacking him for no reason.<br>  <br>  sometimes if you follow that said big daddy, when he goes to one of those weird things against a wall, he will pound on it to see if his little sister is in there and sometimes they will come out, if they do this at about 2 or 3 holes then none are going to come out|`|a8hbGnlOaa	well you will usually find them with a little sister they always go into holes in the wall sometimes if you sneak around the big daddy you will see him calling the little sister out of the whole and either save them or kill them|`|AA11952457	No that is normal.

Once you've set up your ipod you'll be able to access the iTunes store from your ipod and sign in with your user name and password to use your account.<br>  <br>  You use iTunes to copy songs from CDs onto your iPod too. It's really easy to work, and once you have your songs you click sync to copy files to your iPod.   <br>  <br>  You can't enter creditcard or iTunes card details from the ipod only from iTunes on your computer. <br>  <br>  <br>  I love my iPod touch, but if you only want to listen to music then no it isn't worth it. I mostly use the apps I've downloaded and Internet.|`|NvXMahthaa	iTunes is a great way to get songs, it lets you preview 30 sec. of song before you buy it and is truly an easy program. I myself have a credit card account and when I buy songs, it will just show up on the bill, no hassle. I have a friend whose parents are a little more cautious of this method so they buy itunes giftcards from the store and use those if you didnt want your credit card involved.<br>  <br>  I have an iTouch and it is TOTALLY worth the buck. The number of games and applications you can get are virtually limitless. The display is clear as crystal. The Wi-Fi compatability is AWESOME. This thing holds videos, pictures, music, and is basically on its way to also be called a gaming system. Myspace, facebook, monopoly, painting, netflix, AIM, internet, weather, youtube, wikipedia, anything!! There's an app for that.

It has all the latest bells and whistles and is a good balance between cost and features/size.  Amazon has it for $1,500, so you'll have some money left over for a good Blu-ray player.  You could also go with the 52" version which is $500 more.  Not worth it in my opinion, but that depends on the room you're watching it in.<br>  <br>  As far as Blu-ray players go, go with: Panasonic DMP-BD35 ($300), the Sony BDP-S350 ($275) or the Samsung BD-P2500($300).<br>  <br>  Then sit back and enjoy.|`|fwdsp3dVaa	In terms of picture quality...Plasma FTW!<br>  <br>  Panasonic & Samsung Plasma HDTV's are the best in the business and are keeping the Plasma TV going. A lot of manufactures are investing in LCD w/LED backlighting and also OLED HDTV technologies! Those are the technologies of the future, but the distant future! Plan to spend some major coin on them once they come out though!<br>  <br>  But for now Plasma is the best quality picture you can get dollar for dollar! They have the highest contrast ratios(2,000,000:1) and fastest refresh rates(600hz)! If you get a TV 42" or larger, I definitely recommendd getting a Plasma TV.<br>  <br>  For sizes 40" or less, go with a LCD(Samsung, LG, Sony, Phillips or Sharp)!|`|XmxN58XCaa	The plasma technology with soon be over.<br>  -Stick with LCD. 1080p is the best resolution. <br>  -Contrast ratio: of atleast 30,000 to 1 (this is the amount of <br>  "blackness" the t.v. will simulate when there is something black showing on the screen. this applies to all colors.)<br>  -most t.vs now come with 120hz's. if you get a 60hz's, there will be a drag when you're watching fast moving things. like car races, or a football game or video games with a lot of movement. <br>  -Other than that, compare it to other t.vs at the store for clarity and the bulb brightness. (no one likes a darker image)|`|RCbtRF4xaa	The Samsung LN46A550 is an extremely good HD TV and a great value. The TV was delivered on time and with white-glove care, and the TV was set up where I wanted, hooked up, and tested out before I signed the receipt papers. I am very happy with it. The picture is ultra clear, the contrast is great, and the picture bright in my bright living room. Viewing angle is good anywhere in the room.

In the alternate format of high-definition video mode, known as 1080p, the p would stand for progressive scan.<br>  <br>  1080i is a high-definition television (HDTV) video mode. The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels and a frame resolution of 1920 × 1080 or about 2.07 million pixels.<br>  <br>  The field rate of 1080i is typically 60 Hz for NTSC countries (such as United States, Canada and Japan) or 50Hz for PAL/SECAM countries (such as in Europe, Australia, much of Asia, Africa). Because of this the two most common frame rates are 30 frames per second or 25 frames per second. Both variants can be transmitted by both major digital television formats, ATSC and DVB. The frame rate can be either implied by the context or specified after the letter i, such as "1080i30". The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), prefers to use the resolution and frame rate separated by a slash, as in 1080i/30 and 1080i/25, likewise 480i/30 and 576i/25.<br>  <br>  1080i is directly compatible with CRT-based HDTV sets. 1080i is compatible with newer 720p- and 1080p-based televisions but must be deinterlaced first in order to be displayed on those sets. Of note, a very popular panel size used in mid-range HDTVs is 1366 x 768; they are often advertised as 1080i "compatible" or "HD ready" - however these TVs, while accepting a 1080i signal will scale it down to the panel size of 1366x768 as they are physically incapable of displaying 1920x1080 resolutions.[1]<br>  <br>  Due to revision of the NTSC format when color became available, the frame rate of actual 1080i broadcasts is usually 0.1% slower than is implied. For example, a 1080i30 or "30 Hz" transmission actually displays about 29.97 frames each second. Both the straight 24/30/60 and 23.976/29.97/59.94 frequencies are supported by current standards. In European countries where PAL has been used, it is common to code 1080i in 25 frame/s which is equal to 50 fields/s.<br>  <br>  Progressive format 1080p (in 50 Hz or 60 Hz) is becoming common in production and is foreseen as the future broadcasting standard. Today EBU recommends that 720p at 50Hz be used for distribution<br>  <br>  1080P<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p</a><br>  480p is the shorthand name for a video display resolution. The p stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. The 480 denotes a vertical resolution of 480 vertically scanning lines, usually with a horizontal resolution of 640 pixels and 4:3 aspect ratio or a horizontal resolution of 854 pixels and 16:9 aspect ratio.

Without it, you won't have an on-screen cursor. You can potentially get around this in the Wii Menu by using the left analog stick on a Classic Controller. Or you can replace the Sensor Bar with any two small heat sources, like incandescent lightbulbs or lit longstem candles.|`|fodoPCZgaa	Well you should have found out more information but the best thing would be to call Nintendo they will ask you the problem and then you will tell them and they will tell you how and if you can fix it and if they say you cant send it in and then in a couple of weeks of less maybe more i don't know then they will send you a brand new one for free hope this was your best answer|`|hwaTOBL7aa	Sorry to hear that, anyway, you can buy a wireless sensor bar for $20 and you need the sensor bar to get past the home menu and to play most games.

Great deal because a Wii is about $250 and is about  $300 for all those accessories you got.|`|gBkBZNJOaa	the wii sensor bar is what you picks up the signal if you aim your wii remote at the screen. if you had a classic controller you could move the cursor around with the analog stick but without a classic controller you really need a wii sensor. get it on Ebay.

Then take your speaker to a friend's house and try it on his equipment. That should narrow it down.<br>  <br>  It is likely the internal amp, or the original cable. It is often possible to open a unit up and remove and replace even a molded cable.<br>  <br>  But first try the other, then come back and add details to your question and we'll go from there.

If there is no encryption, it is simple to connect and the benefit is that you will have faster download speeds.  Sometimes you will need to buy something from the Bar/Coffee shop to get their wep-key however..or get AT&T DSL/U-Verse to get connected in most McDonalds and Starbucks across the country (In the States at least) or pay the $3 to be connected for 24 hrs.<br>  <br>  You have to be in range of the Wi-Fi router though, much like your wireless would work in your house.

Invest the remaining cash in preorders for The Conduit (June), and Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 (Fall)<br>  <br>  If you're not in the mood to pick up 7 games, I may reccomend spending some of the cash on a Nintendo DSi, when it hits in April, if you don't already have a DS Lite.

Component cables could be another $10-$20, but you'd get the best possible picture on your new TV.<br>  <br>  So that leaves about $240 for games and other accessories.<br>  <br>  Wii Play is a $50 game that is essentially a Wii Remote with a $10 game.  It's worth it, I guess.  Another $20 will get you your second nunchuk, too.  That leaves $170.<br>  <br>  Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Kart Wii are probably the two games that every Wii owner should own.  We're down to $90.  <br>  <br>  I'd say Wii Fit would also be worth while.  Or you could get Animal Crossing: City Folk - the bundle with the Wii Speak accessory is $70.<br>  <br>  If you don't already have a Broadband Router with Wifi, a good one will set you back $30, and you'd be able to get your Wii online very easily.<br>  <br>  You may also want a GameCube controller and Memory Card.  The GameCube had a ton of great games, and the Wii is capable of playing them, too.  A used wired gamecube controller can be had for $5-$10, a memory card for about the same.  Wavebirds are a little harder to find and more expensive - $20-$40, even used, but having wireless controllers is a priceless luxury.  You can also use the GC controller for SSBB and MKW, as well as SNES and N64 virtual console games.  Personally, I like the feel of the Classic controller attachment - $20, but it can only be used in a couple games outside of the Virtual Console games (you can use it with SSBB and MKW, too).<br>  <br>  You have a ton of options.  But shop around - $1000 can go pretty far if you're sure you're getting the best deal you can possibly get.|`|3d2ce992f7a4d06120c7b88f85ef2ee1aa	I might get a few thumbs down but I own a wii and I'm telling you that would be a huge mistake to spend $1000.00 on a wii and its accessories, the ps3 or xbox360 are 1000% better...I love nintendo but the wii is nothing more than a gamecube with motion sensor controllers...save your money!|`|PbhC7eonaa	well for 1000 dollars id go with a ps3 or xbox 360 because the wii is only fun with other people|`|ON3CKuM6aa	I would save that 1,000 dollors.

I have found phone voice recordings to be much more useful than a written statement.<br>  <br>  You will need a device to record the phone calls. The Olympus TP7 Telephone Recording Device has been getting good reviews at various websites. <br>  <br>  The device works by inserting the earpiece into your ear prior to beginning the call. You then plug the male adapter into your tape recorder. Hit record. Then proceed to use your phone as you normally would. The microphone in the earpiece picks up the audio from the other parties voice as well as your own voice. <br>  <br>  You could also start the recording process in the middle of a phone call if needed. <br>  <br>  This is from an article on eHow - which I authored: How to Record Cell Phone Calls. The device works for landline phones.  Check it out if you like. I also included a link to state by state law on recording. Hope this helps.

Listen to the tweeter and the woofer to make sure both work on both speakers.  If they work and are in good condition it does not sound like a bad deal.

Then in 2007 Sony released 2 80GB PS3 bundles, Motorstorm and Metal Gear Solid 4 that also played a limited number of PS2 games.<br>  <br>  The current 80GB and 160 GB PS3 models WILL NOT PLAY PS2 GAMES ! <br>  <br>  For information on which PS3 models play PS2 games, click the link below !|`|ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	backward compatibility for the PS3 with PS2 games is as follows:<br>  <br>  20GB (no longer in production) - yes<br>  60GB (no longer in production) - yes<br>  80GB with 4 USB slots (no longer in production, bundled with MGS4 or Motor Storm) - yes<br>  40GB (no longer in production) - NO<br>  80GB with 2 USB slots - NO<br>  160GB - NO<br>  any other up coming PS3's - NO<br>  <br>  all PS3s play PS1 games.<br>  <br>  as far as the 360 goes, if you want to play original Xbox games, you MUST have a hard drive, plus not all games are backwards compatible.  it's about the same as the MotorStorm and MGS4 PS3 systems.  only the 20 and 60 could play nearly all PS2 games while those 80s can only play maybe 80% or so.|`|q6uyloYdaa	You can on older PS3s. If you went to a store today and bought one it would not be able to play PS2 games. 60GB and 80GB are the compatible systems. You can find them on eBay, as they are both discontinued.<br>  Also, since you're trying to choose between the two. 360 does play old XBOX games, but NOT all of them.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Yes, if you have the 60 or 80GB with 4 USB Ports.|`|4lyylp9Qaa	yes FOR THE MOST PART<br>  <br>  it actually depends on the type of ps3 you get. there are different sizes, the main ones being a 80g, 60g. (also a 40 and 20) The 60g is no longer being made and may be hard to find. the 80g would be the most popular then.<br>  <br>  The 60g is the only one that is able to play ALL ps1 and ps2 games. I believe it was made with the same laser as the ps2 and therefore is able to read all the discs. (that's what i heard) The 80g is able to play MOST ps2 and ps1 games. so your best bet would be to get a smaller hardrive, the 60g, to play all the games. But overall, they are all able to play most games, which may not be a huge deal.<br>  <br>  the person below me is correct. i forgot to mention that new ps3's do not have a capability feature.|`|yjWe6mUMaa	Depends where you're from.

ywer453paa	call 1-800-MY-APPLE.<br>  <br>  They're amazing, and will help you with ANYTHING! Just keep in mind you'll need the serial code for the iPod (it's on the back, near the bottom)<br>  They're going to ask you for it.. so just be prepared. <br>  <br>  Something tells me though it might be a battery issue. Hmmm. Not too sure though! Have you tried hooking your iPod up to your computer and restoring it's original settings?? Give that a try!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with it all.
HY22vMOhaa	I don't think this will work. Apple is very stricked about sharing music or applications with other people. If it does work they way disappear if you sync it more than once from your own library. I have never tried it but it it worth a shot. besides, what do you have to lose?|`|Tn8HSLzuaa	Once you put them in your library you will be asked to enter the Apple ID and password of the owner whose app it is. If this does not happen, when you try and sync it will say something like 'unable to sync certain app'. You should authorize you and your friends' computers. I did this with my friend and we give each other all our apps for free. in iTunes, go to Store>Authorize computer... Enter his Apple ID and password (ask him for it and tell him he can change it as soon as your done). This will wuthorize the pair of computers and from then on you will be able to transfer apps between yourselves legally and free without being prompted for a password in the future.|`|0vF6WM7Eaa	I'm pretty sure you'll need his password and login. All the things on iTunes are locked which means you cant just share your music/video/whatever you buy on iTunes with everyone. Thats kind of the whole point of paying for things on iTunes. It would work better if you just plugged your iPod into his computer and put the Apps on there straight from his computer rather than going through the hassle of a flash drive that probably wont even work.

0vF6WM7Eaa	Thats weird. Its also weird that its still playing because the first thing I would assume is that it is a virus. I'd defiantly be apprehensive about plugging my iPod because you really never know what can happen if the iTunes is acting strange. Try uninstalling iTunes and loading it again. All your music will still be there.

w2HKG6tpaa	It's pretty much a standard now-a-days for it to be included. Unless you want to get a receiver and speakers separate (Sears, Best Buy) [$300-600] you'll have to suffer through the ailment of two DVD players. My recommendation: Check out the Panasonic HTIBs Sears carries, they have a 10" Kelton sub which delivers great bass and awesome sound overall.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	The HTiB's mostly come with a DVD player, and no auxiliary inputs.<br>  <br>  You're really better off just buying a receiver and speaker set separately.  Many stores will give you a discount if you pick up a receiver and speaker set which is essentially the same as HTiB, just with more boxes.

It might be one of those games that started out as a little idea that turn into a great game.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	I don't think the Balance Board can tell what your hands are doing....<br>  <br>  Then again, looking at Dance Dance Revolution, which makes you use the remote and nunchuck for your hands, I guess it's possible.

Daylight balanced bulbs aren't cheap. It will produce a lot of light for being 27 watts, but it's still not going to be as bright as if you used strobes.

S2cv5oOWaa	I love the Curve. it is very hard to text on the pearl. Beware. You may get hand cramps. My friend has one on ATandT and she hates it. It gets scratched very easily!! Do not forget about the Storm!! it is beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!|`|iLKnmyAMaa	curve, cuz the keyboard is easier to type on.
WRs6X0Araa	The Ipod touch is much better, the Ipod nano only lasts about a year because it's very small and its battery dies.<br>  Since the Ipod touch has a much better battery, it lasts much longer.<br>  And the applications on it are better too.<br>  You can go on the internet if you have WiFi, it's good for working out because it has a timer and it can tell how fast you are, ect.<br>  So I would by the Ipod touch.<br>  I've had an Ipod nano, and I now have an Ipod touch and I have no problems with it.|`|idKfxUTkaa	Well it depend on how much you want to spend. Also, if you just want it for Music or something else.<br>  <br>  I like the itouch, I'm thinking of buying a itouch. They seem to have a lot more to toy with and play with on it. You can do much more on a iTouch then on a Nano. So I say iTouch, but it's all on you if you want to spend much or less. So just have to see what your willing to put out.|`|kjAQj3i7aa	I love my ipod touch! I'm actually on it now! There are so many cool applications you can get for free from the app store too.|`|HY22vMOhaa	I had an ipod touch 8gb. I bought it when it was 300 dollars. god i regret buying it because now i have like 20 gigs of music so i sold it. It was very cool with the games and apps though. If you just listen to music i would save your money and my a nano. Zunes are better in my opinion.|`|T1Si1yvlaa	iPod touch. the nano goes out of style every 6 months, so just get the touch. i have it and its totally worth it. <br>  <br>  !! ;)|`|vp90jG8Daa	ipod touch would would be great because it has internet 4 example,but if you just want it to listen 2 music go 4 da ipod nano.|`|gtINkA19aa	you won't waste your money if you get what you want.
ZwmVrFeWaa	if your friend got internet  it will be easier for her to download it but if not you could use daemon tools LIGHT(free version) to create an image of the disc and then burn it on the empty disc. You will need a dvd burner in order to burn an dvd image. And probably you will need a crack to run the game from a copy.

You can share music with others by turning the volume up really loud on your headphones, which usually isn't a good idea. Or you can get a small set of speakers to plug into the headphone jack. I have a stereo adapter that plugs into the sync cable area and then into the aux slots in the stereo and then you control the song from the ipod and the volume from the stereo. If you get a stereo adapter that plugs into the headphone port the volume on the ipod itself will affect what comes through the speakers.|`|PiAnsKE2aa	No.Only the second generation =D|`|IpuZnH1naa	no it doesn't. but the speaker in 2nd gen sucks nyways|`|17Yv4iTiaa	idk <br>  lol, buy me and i will let you know later ***JuSt JoKiNg***

And if you buy it from Ritz, you get free lessons.  Those are worth a lot!|`|eVptHOOBaa	Yes, online you'll get much better prices!<br>  But be aware of TOO good prices, because they are usually a fraud, and there is a lot of that online.<br>  <br>  If you want to buy online, buy only from reputable stores with solid customer service and return policies.

82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	You bricked it. It’s gone.<br>  <br>  Just kidding. What you want to do is hold both the power and the home button on the iPod for 15 seconds, then let go of the power button while still holding the home button for another 15 seconds. This will make the iPod boot into DFU mode. When it does, iTunes should recognize it and offer you the option to restore the iPod.  Once you restore it, you can attempt to jailbreak it again, but this time, try reading all of the instructions over or get someone with more experience to jailbreak it for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|RYvtTeT1aa	You might have bricked it which means its a goner.

The nano doesn't have a hard drive so if you drop it, you won't destroy it.  The other 2 do have hard drives.  If you have TONS of songs or want movies on there too then you'll need one of the other 2 because they hold more.  If you want the WIFI then only the touch has that.
tHjBr4L4aa	Vibration Reduction (VR) is a great feature and I enjoy it on my 18-200mm VR.  But, there were amazing photos taken over the years before VR, IS, or any of the other acronyms for stabilization.  If you use proper technique and/or a tripod/monopod, you will do fine.  Just learn to hold your DSLR correctly (right hand on body, left hand beneath the lens) and plant your feet so you are steadiest.<br>  <br>  Look for VR in your next lens (eg: 80-300mm VR), if it's a feature available at an achievable price for you.  Personally, I turn off my VR when tracking action in sports.  And my last couple of lens purchases, didn't have VR.|`|tWoN22rRaa	That largely depends on how, when, and where you generally shoot. In broad daylight there should be enough light do without it. And it's pointless when using a tripod. However while shooting indoors under typical lighting or at night, and handholding the camera,  VR can come in handy.<br> <br> If it is an issue you could invest just a tad bit more on the 55-200 VR.  Not only does it have the vibration reduction,  but is also slightly better built than the non-VR version.

6GIrW5eWaa	Sorry but I am going to hijack your answer area to answer gunmans question. Why do they use an HDMI when it isn't High Definition. The answer is pretty simple to see. It is a single cable source that can carry both video and audio information. It is easier to route internal to a wall instead of the composite video and audio connectors of the original cable. By the way it can provide a 1080p output as long as the game is developed to that format as well. Currently most games are 720 but there are a few games that utilize the full spectrum. <br>  <br>  Regarding your pinkish tint and thank you for letting me bypass your question originally. More than likely it is either a cabling issue (doubtful) or a graphics issue which would need to be repaired. If you have available a different cable try that out first, try it on a different TV if you have one and then if these steps do not correct the issue contact MS. Sorry|`|HekFanRvaa	I don't understand why xbox rides the HDMI bandwagon when xbox is not really HD. Component cables are enough for Xbox's resolution.|`|oJJmJTuaaa	It's probably an issue with the GPU. Try using a different cable and pray to christ that fixes it. Ignore gunman, he knows nothing. Even if the 360 wasn't HD, which it is, would you rather have one cable for audio and video or five? Simple answer.

162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	As a novice photographer, you will have to begin a steep learning curve to get good portrait shots, much less professional looking.    It's not the camera, but the skill and knowledge of the photographer that are more important.  That said, a great portrait lens for a crop sensor is the Nikkor 50mm f/1.8, at around $100.  Very sharp, and will allow you to get those "bokeh backgrounds" that many here on Y!A ask about.|`|AA12323486	Either camera will take good portraits, in the hands of someone who knows how to take portraits.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I just returned the D40 (also a nice camera) for the d60 with VR lenses (The 18-55 and the 55-200) <br>  I can not say enough great things about this camera. The VR makes a BIG difference. If you are considering buying a DSLR and are moving from a Point and shoot to a DSLR this is the one you want!!! WITH VR (vibration reduction!!) I had an Olympus I bought about four years ago that was a point and shoot. Top of the line at the time. It looks like a child too the pics after I compared them to the D60. Mine came with a cool little camera bag as well that is WONDERFUL! Not the prettiest thing ever but great for taking this camera every where I want to go. <br>  <br>  I am a scrapbooker and a Mom not a professional. I am sure that if you are like me this would be perfect for preserving memories as well as fulfilling my dream of being an amateur photographer!! <br>  <br>  I highly recommend this camera. When I bought it I actually had people stop me and say "I have that camera I love it!!" the cashier said "we sure sell a lot of these!" May I also mention it was NOT a electronics or camera store so I think that is saying a lot! :) <br>  <br>  Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens<br>  Price: $539.41<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B0012OGF6Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235749204&sr=8-1&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digit...</a>

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	A 2000 watt generator won't power a home.  It will power your freezer and refrigerator, a few lights and your TV and game system but not much else.  The fridge and freezer are the most important as they will keep your food fresh.  Together, they'll use about 1000 watts depending on their size.  You won't be able to use an electric stove, 1200 watts for one small burner, 2400 for a big one.  Don't forget to turn the breaker off to your hot water heater, 4500 watts.  If you try to get more power out of the generator than it can provide you'll just trip the breaker in it.  You might cause it to overheat and be damaged if it's overloaded for too long.  The greater the load on a generator the faster it uses it's fuel.  Like driving faster in your car, it takes more gas.  The generator will run as long as there's fuel in the tank.  How fast you use that fuel is up to you.  <br>  The link below leads to a listing of typical power consumption for electrical appliances.|`|1yov0JF9aa	2000 watts is very small... 2000 watts is maximum, peak load. Typically this means 1000 watts continuous.<br>  <br>  I have a 15,000w generator.<br>  <br>  figure about a 1/2 gallon of gas per hour.|`|AA11061397	That depends on how much fuel (gasoline?) you have and how quickly the generator consumes the fuel.<br>  <br>  It's impossible to give a better answer without you providing some figures.

w2HKG6tpaa	First and foremost, if you will have small children near the TV or are prone for wild late night parties, then I would suggest the plasma as its screen can take much more abuse than an LCD. <br>  <br>  They each have their pros and cons, for example:<br>  <br>  - Pros -<br>  LN46A650<br>   * 50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio delivers extraordinary blacks and decent whites (white can sometimes have an antique white color, but can be adjusted to minimize)<br>   * Power consumption approximately 240 watts (that's four 60w lamps!)<br>   * Light weight (75lbs)<br>   * No burn in<br>   * 120hz which greatly matches the plasma's clarity.<br>   * GREAT for gaming<br>  <br>  PN50A650 <br>  * 1,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio (DIFFERENT FROM LCD MEASUREMENTS! about equal to the 50k:1 from LN) which is top-notch among plasmas<br>  * Superior black and white reproduction<br>  * Tough panel compared to LCDs<br>  * Less glossy screen cover than LN46A650<br>  <br>  - Cons -<br>  LN46A650<br>  <br>  * Glossy screen is very reflective (A630 has matte screen)<br>  * White isn't always as "white" as it should be.<br>  * Sometimes black has a subtle blue tint to it.<br>  <br>  PN50A650 <br>  <br>  * High energy usage (550 watts.. what's that about nine 60w lamps in your house?)<br>  * Can suffer from burn in especially with games or any scenes left on it for extended period of time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, it's a very tough call. If it's purely for movies, the plasma is a great choice, but if it's for everything including games or the 24/7 news channel, go for the LCD. No burn in (ie, maps or stock ticker) with the LN46A650. Less power consumption. But, I will tell you that the PN50A650  has an amazing picture when it's playing a Blu-ray disc, very breathtaking. <br>  <br>  Joey|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I just bought the PN50A550 plasma TV.  It is fantastic.  The 650 is almost identical.  (The ToC and a different anti-reflective screen are the primary differences.)  That said, the 46" LCD is a great TV.  The picture won't be quite as nice, but it is lower maintenance.  I was going through the same battle myself, but since I'm a cheapskate I went with the 550 plasma.<br>  <br>  If you have a bright room go with the LCD.  If you'll be watching it primarily in a dark room go with the plasma.  Or you could just flip a coin or buy the one that's less expensive.  If you're buying it in a store see which one you can bargain down more.|`|gorHSgUAaa	Samsung LN46A65 sure.

In 2009 the speed is going to get even faster with the system sellers coming out like Killzone 2, InFAMOUS, Uncharted 2, Heavy Rain, MAG and Final Fantasy.

My opinion:<br>  <br>  1. PS3<br>  2. PC<br>  3. Wii<br>  4. 360<br>  <br>  I have absolutely NO HATE on 360 or Wii. It's just, what major exclusives will they have? Wii have Madworld and Conduit and the only games I know for 360 are "HALO" War, "HALO" 3 ODST and Splinter Cell, that's about it.<br>  <br>  Why I ranked PC over the two is because there will be more MMORPG's this year, Starcraft 2 will be coming out, Diablo 3 will be coming out and I heard a new Crysis.|`|pOi0wewIaa	I think it might caught up to 360's sales|`|1HtTxOOQaa	First of all, PS3 has never been loosing to the 360. The 360 has a years head start over PS3. Total sale till date stands at around 28 million 360 and 21.8 million PS3 . That leaves a buffer of around 6-7 million units. <br>  <br>  PS3 has been around for 2 years and last year sold around 10.7 million units. So that means PS3 sold around 10-11 million units in 2007 as well (launch date included as it came out later in 2006). 360 also had 10.75-10.8 million units shipped last year (beating PS3 by a hair). There were nearly 10 million sold during the launch year and 2006. So by doing the math, we come to the conclusion that 360 sold nearly 8-9 million units in 2007. That means in 2007, PS3 beat 360 in sales and in 2008 too PS3 beat 360 (cause the 360 is counting all the replacement units of those who got RROD which is unfair). So it's safe to assume that PS3 has been out selling the 360 or on par with the 360 for the past 2 years (if you don't trust me, search for it on the internet.)<br>  <br>  Last year, the PS3 outsold the 360 for 7 months (thanx to MGS4). But, MS cunningly cut the price and so 360 sold more units during the later half. This was the problem last year. Huge exclusive at the start, followed by a lean 4-5 months followed by Resistance 2 and LBP which weren't marketed well, led to the downfall of PS3 later during the year. But now, Sony has taken a few tips from MS and has marketed KZ2 quiet well. Also, this year Sony is spoilt by choices. As mentioned by you, all the games are major AAA titles and all will keep the Sony sales alive unlike last year where it seemed like only MGS4 was shipping sony and sparing them the blushes.<br>  <br>  Sony sales have already been up due to the arrival of KZ2(sony has been outselling the 360 in this month). With the 360 having a virtual drought this year (Halo Wars and OSTD thats it), PS3 has a great opportunity to bridge the gap in between. If only sony introduces a price cut, then the sales will see a huge increase. Hopefully Sony doesn't act stupid.
ejKv4aLCaa	I'm not sure, but I guess it was because of the programming schedule.  The 11:30 is a AAA rated schedule (there are more people watching TV at that time) Hope this helps.

CQA4HAdmaa	I'm sorry, but Apple deliberately doesn't build anti-theft security in it's products.  Apple things you will end up buying another and they will get more sales. Not Apple products allow encryption of your hard disk either.  It will be next to impossible to recover.  It's unfortunate dishonesty is coming more common.  I have found and returned 6 iPods.  2 video ipods, 2 touches and 2 Nanos. If you report it to police, they will require information that will enable them to identify it if all your information was stripped clean.  They will never investigate it, but if it turns up in a theft ring, then they will let you know.  <br>  <br>  So Sorry.  Best thing to do is to get a refurbished one|`|JNfMKD40aa	The iPod Touch doesn't actually have real GPS in it, so there is no way to actually track it.

pZGLhV2Waa	What you need to find is a good camera store in your area. I am in the US but I'm sure that you can find a couple of good camera stores in Sydney. Most good privately owned camera stores here rent out equipment at reasonable rates. You should be able to rent a good DSLR camera and lens for $50-$100 US dollars a day. A lot will depend on the value of the camera and lens. You will probably need to have a credit card that will cover the replacement cost of the equipment if you break it or don't bring it back though.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	I am not sure whether flexirent or mr rentals or some other company allows a week or around this , you may need to just look around at the rental joints , there will be and allowance for this , and there will additionally be the places to hire . they will be expensive in most cases , but yes they will be there somewhere|`|cMdudv6aaa	Don't think there's a place that rents out Digital SLRs.

QVNVAH7Qaa	Basically, a large group gets exiled from Vetka (ISA Planet) and go to another planet, where they adapt, become stronger, and rebuild.<br>  <br>  Killzone 1: They want revenge, so they attack Vetka, but fail to take the             planet.<br>  <br>  Killzone Liberation (PSP): Last of the Helghast are being fought off.<br>  <br>  Killzone 2: Now its the ISA's turn. They invade Helghast. <br>  <br>  Killzone 2 does not feature a co op campaign, but developers from Guerila Games say they are "looking into it" <br>  So that is a possibility for the future. Most likely a patch. <br>  <br>  Online features team based matches with up to 32 players. (16vs16)<br>  <br>  What makes the game really great is the graphics. A gamespot.com reviewer says that "killzone 2 may be the most visually advanced shooter ever created"<br>  <br>  There you go. <br>  <br>  The cover system is a first on FPS. It does not go to 3rd person when using the cover system. That is another really great thing.<br>  <br>  Also, the maps for online matches will have three sizes. Small, Medium, and Large. <br>  All out war maps and also tactical maps. Very detailed of course.|`|pl2SocVKaa	killzone was pretty bad so don't buy it you don't need the story and it has no co op but has online and epic campaign and what makes it shine is online play|`|jxpV13rTaa	it is released tomorrow, but i can tell you it will be great. i cant believe this, but it does NOT have multiplayer. the storyline does continue from the first killzone (first one was on earth, this one will be on the helghast planet) but its not crutial to play the first one. im really only buying the game for the online play. the game has the best graphics of any game on any console and is the most anticipated game of the year. its average rating was 9.4 throughout world reviews. i have played the demo and it is unreal. i cant wait for the online play. i loved killzone 1 and like you said, that got a 7.5 rating. imagine the capabilities of killzone 2. it is a must get.|`|VcNHahtgaa	No need to buy Killzone 1, just read the story about it on the internet if you want.<br>  <br>  Campaign = 8-10 hours long<br>  <br>  No co-op, might be patched in the future.<br>  <br>  Online is amazing and vast, you will get addicted to it and play for years on it like Call of Duty 4 and Counter Strike.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Killzone 1 was a good game it was not great. If you want to get on the story line Read Killzone 1's wikipedia article and play Killzone Liberation for PSP and you will have a good base for KZ2.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	Nah. There are a few characters here and there which are repeated in KZ2, but even the main character in this is different. Go to <br>  <br>  www.killzone.com    (site might be jammed today, so go to wiki)<br>  <br>  Read the story. It awesomely explained (entire timeline and stuff that happened even before Killzone 1). If you want it in a nutshell, then all you need to know is that you are a member of ISA on the planet Vekta. During KZ1 and KZL (PSP), you fight the Helghans from the planet Helghan who want to take over your planet. This time around, fed up of Helghan assault, you go to their planet to kick their a*s. Basically both the Helghans and Vektans are earthlings. the resources on planet earth were depleting and so they colonized the 2 planets- Helghan and Vektan. <br>  <br>  There is no co-op in the game currently. There are talks of putting it via a DLC but there is no official announcement. It definitely has online and probably is the best of the lot. The online multi-player supports upto 32 players and has a COD type upgrade system. It's great.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of things that make the game great. First off all are the visuals. It's undoubtedly the best looking game (2GB texture per level is insane). Also, the AI is the best till date. The enemies and your squad mates are really intelligent. It's great to play with them in offline multi-player (yes the game has that too). There are many other factors... why don't you read the review by going to the below link.|`|9sRUf4zEaa	It isn't critical that you play the original killzone, you get the basic idea here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone.</a> Just note in the game there will be times when characters in Killzone 2 will reference battles from killzone 1, but that isn't really important. In terms of features, there isn't any online or offline co-op campaign or online (hopeful will come later). <br>  <br>  The best thing about the game has to be the online. Sure you can only carry one major weapon (apart from from the pistol and combat knife) and you can't shoot from cover while doing online multiplayer but that keeps the game interesting. What's cool is you can form a 4 people  unit within your own team which allows you to respond close to your unit leader and have better communication. The game also features a class system and ranking system similar to Call of Duty World at War and Resistance 2. Also, having a clan is more than a fancy tag next to your name. On the official website you can make your own clan page, make ranking within your own clan, challange other clans, ect. Heck, there even tournaments going on.|`|HYklfMZ8aa	Killzone 2 on PS3 does follow on from Killzone on PS2.  The basic storyline in Killzone is that the Helghast (bad guys) go to Vekta, the home planet of the ISA (good guys), and start a war.  In Killzone 2, the reverse happens and the ISA go to the Helghan planet and get revenge.<br>  <br>  You don't need to buy Killzone.  Just go straight to Killzone 2.  I haven't played Killzone but I own Killzone 2.  I understand the storyline.  It's a simple storyline but the gameplay is unbelievable.<br>  <br>  There is only 1-player campaign.  There is online.  It's unlike Call of Duty because you can create games for people to join like SOCOM: Confrontation.  The Killzone 2 online is called Warzone.<br>  <br>  9.5/10!!!!

1yov0JF9aa	complete your question!<br>  <br>  plug a 110V toaster into what - 24V, 220V, 440 three phase?|`|e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	The toaster won't have a fixed resistance so you'll have to  assume a fixed resistance to answer this question.  <br>  Doubling the voltage supplied to a fixed load will double the current through that load.  This means 4 times the power as the power is voltage times current.  2 times the voltage multiplied by 2 times the current equals 4 times the power or watts.  This would usually mean a melted toaster.  Certainly burnt toast.  <br>  The toaster isn't a fixed load because the resistance of the heating element goes up with temperature.  The increased voltage and current will make the elements get hotter than they normally would and limit the current a bit.  Probably not enough to prevent melt down, however.|`|PiNi9OhEaa	You will need to specify more in your question.....<br>  <br>  I will assume you mean ....."rated at 110-V, into a 220-V, outlet...." which the answer to your question would be  c.) twice what it should be.  The resistance of the heater coils is a fixed quantity, and for all practicle purposes, is purely resistive (consumes real power).  Using ohms law  (Voltage = Current * Resistance), you can swap the equation around to read I = V/R, and can clearly see that increasing V will proportionly increase I.<br>  <br>  Note:  Fixed resistance is implied for simplification|`|0h9aD7Toaa	well a 120 volt toaster plugged into 240 volts will draw twice what it should for a very short time until it burns up

6GIrW5eWaa	It should work only in the game or while you are playing Rock Band. My daughter and I play with friends online and they are able to hear her when she is singing but only in between sets. During the actual songs being played the singer instantly becomes blocked. We hear them on the TV as well. So the answer is yes "sort of" I don't believe although we have never had a reason to try it outside of the game that you can just do standard chat over live with it. Probably best just to get a new headset. Good Luck

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	The 550 has 7.1 analog multi-channel outputs that 350 doesn't, but this feature is good only for connecting to an old receiver with 7.1 analog multi-channel inputs to get HD sounds. Your Onkyo 706 receiver supports audio via HDMI connection and Sony 350 has 7.1 HD decoder on board, so you don't have to spend more money for 7.1 analog outputs.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Both the 350 and 550 can output 7.1 audio.  It's just that the 550 can do so via analog.  This means if you have an old receiver that doesn't take HDMI you can still get 7.1 audio by plugging your speakers directly into it via analog connectors.  So if you run the a/v from the 350 to your Onkyo via HDMI you can play the 7.1 soundtrack just fine.

They also have good online play if you like running around shooting online people. You also get a lot of perks and achievements as you go along, like better weapons, better scopes and making it harder for other characters online to kill you. These may be what you are looking for if you like that type of game. But Grand Theft Auto IV is a really great game with a really long story mode which has a lot of twists and turns, plus the online play has very many modes. Plus you can drive around, fly around and talk and play with other characters that can help you or fight against you. Gears of War the original was good for online and offline play but it is basically the same as Call of Duty online as you would be running just shooting people. I am not sure about Fallout 3 as I have not played it online but it has a very good story mode from what I have seen so far. So it all depends on what you like in game stories and online play.|`|uBTqEy4Naa	obviously fallout 3 has a lot of game play but gow2 and the cod games have great campaigns and online. although im a big fan of gow2 i would choose cod waw.   its got real footage of wwII and it follows the call of duty finest hour for ps2.  THE ONLINE IS GREAT!!!|`|TDgjQcvoaa	Gears 2 Is Laggy As Shi*. COD 4 No one is going to play in a month. GTA and Fallout get really boring fast.

I used to like to taint my milk and then drink from the jug with others looking on in disgust.<br>  <br>  Here is another great trick if your friends have children that drink Kool-Aid or juice. Empty the Kool-Aid/juice into the sink. Fill the container back up with water and add a few drops of the appropriate coloring dye to make the water look like the previous contents of the pitcher. The kids will complain to their parents that something is wrong with the Kool-Aid. When I did it, my friend told his kids, "you are just imagining things, I am not going to waste good money and mix another batch just because you kids want more sugar in your Kool-Aid." He finally tasted the phony mixture and realized something was amiss, but not before making his children feel inadequate.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	peanut  butter on the tops of the inside of their shoes

eUxpZDhXaa	depends on the length and quality of each track. If you choose a crappy quality mp3 tracks (128kbps) a 4 min song will be probably 4mb maybe 4-5mb. If you use a good quality mp3 (320kbps) a 4 min song will be like 9mb. If your going with crap quality you'll fit like 150 songs maybe, but if you go with dec quality you'll probably fit 80 or 90 on there.<br>  <br>  for a dvd, and decent quality MP3s you'll probably fir 500 on it, and if you go for crappy quality files you'll get probably 900-1000.<br>  <br>  But over all this I'd suggest buying cds, the quality is alot better and you support the artist.
zgw1CbVDaa	Don't even bother trying to unlock it if you are going to try using it with T-Mobile as it will not work.  Boost Mobile's i series phones are iDEN, while T-Mobile's phones and network are GSM.  While both use sim cards, they are two different technologies and are not compatible with each other.  iDEN phones can only be used with other iDEN providers, such as Nextel and SouthernLINC.

The person probably isn't going to say, "Look I stole this iPod look at all this music from that kid" obviously that would get him into trouble, and you would just get the iPod back.<br>  seriously, whoever stole it wouldn't tell everyone that he stole it, he could probably care a less about the music on there and probably more about the ipod itself. it would be stupid for him to say tell everyone he stole an iPod<br>  <br>  trust me, he doesn't care about the music on your iPod, or about even making fun of you, He probably doesn't even know who he stole it from.|`|CqAeFbexaa	I feel 4 ya one time i tried to elbow the person behind me in a very tight line and I accidentally punched the persons but in front of me!|`|6ztVAbRpaa	dont worry just tell them why do you care if me and my sister share songs and why did you take my ipod in the first place.

QPRwqbDlaa	Jailbreaking is when you change the firmware on your itouch to allow you to access 3d party applications (most of which are free) and put them on your itouch. However, if you do this and your itouch crashes and locks up, apple will consider the warrantee on the itouch void and won't fix it. But all you have to do is  1) turn it off completely 2) plug it into your computer 3) turn it on then immediately press and hold the sleep/wake and home buttons. 4) apple logo will appear and when it does, release the sleep/wake button. Then the itouch will reboot. To acually jailbreak your itouch, google "jailbreak itouch 1st generation". You may also want to do some further research on it first and consider both the risks and benefeits.

It has a more substantial feel. Besides the Video hype- The D90 does not offer much more than the 40d. The image quality will be identical. Do not just look at megapixels. I think you will like the feel more of the 40d. The Canon has a more important ( to me anyway ) feature-set. The D90 has many features, but for in the field photography they are definitely less important. My opinion is you should get the 40d. If you feel the desire to record videos get a camcorder. I think you'll like the Canon more.<br>  <br>  The only real difference is the Video ability in the D90.<br>  <br>  ***Edit****<br>  <br>  XOXO Is not necessarily correct.|`|sBGqBYJqaa	defiantly Nikon D90 those are the best don't get a canon Nikon's are much better i know this from experience

I had an employee who wanted to get out of his contract because our company was offering a cheaper cell phone plan.  He went on the internet and found an area that is not a service area of his cell phone provider.   He then found a copy of a lease agreement for an apartment complex in this area and he printed it out, filled it out and sent it over to his cell phone company because that was what they wanted as proof that he was living there.  He faxed it and they cut him loose from his contract.  Call your cell phone company and see what they require.

06ef572a98f16f56b151e070c23c8dc2aa	i believe this is a repeat question which i have answered partially on another thread . <br>  <br>  w700 and w810 are walkman phones <br>  this means that they are essentially a k750 bhone running on a slightly modified firmware that includes the famous walkman function for better sound . additions to the walkman phones are better sound and something called MEGABASS for increased sound quality . <br>  <br>  k750 is one of the first few phones that Sony Ericsson came up with autofocus and 2.0 megapixels cameras . many people are using this model despite its age and dull appearance . however , this phone also has a music player but not a walkman one . hence , sound quality will be slightly inferior compared to a walkman phone . <br>  <br>  w700 and k750 seem to be the same phone with a differnt face plate and housing rite? this is because they are esentially the same phone with similar features , <br>  <br>  the k750 , w800 , w700 and even the D750(China) are all the same phones with one or two different features and functions . <br>  <br>  now to the w810 <br>  <br>  the w810 is an improvement to the w800 which is similar to k750 , D 750 and w700 . <br>  <br>  it has an improvement in a sense that it has EDGE capabilities and an added band of network coverage . <br>  <br>  one more band of coverage will ensure you stay connected with family and friends but not in korea or japan cos of cdma networks . <br>  <br>  hope this helped .|`|666f9219e51bdab9795bdc7b2690202faa	Simply, w 810|`|e2ca8f16a1f0b922ef58edbb32f30a6eaa	none! get the k800i!

cOQCC93maa	Heyy, I'm having the same problem as we speak, I'm pretty sure its something that goes with "Media Loading Problems". If your still under warranty, just call Sony to get your system repaired for free. They will ship you an empty box, you have to put your system in and ship it back to them, (All free and easy to do), once you ship it to them, you can check online for your system status, to see if they got it yet, and all you have to do is wait to get your system back whether new or refurbished, (takes about an average of 1-2 weeks, SOMETIMES a bit more). If your not under warranty any more, I still recommend calling them to see if you can sort things out. Their number is 1-800-345-(SONY) which is 7669.<br>  <br>  Hoped this helped:D, and good luck.<br>  <br>  P.s. Just for a heads up it would cost between 150-190 dollars (in Canada anyway) to get it repaired without warranty. But like I said, It won't hurt to call Sony for assistance.|`|AA10197673	i had the same problem... your light in you ps2 is gone. so it has trouble reading the disks. i would suggest sending it to sony, or spend less and just buy a new one from game crazy for 60-70$

JTb6ezTxaa	Okay.<br>  <br>  I work for Verizon so this information should help.<br>  You cannot block numbers from calling your phone.<br>  SOME OLD PHONES HAVE THIS VVV<br>  You can block texts if you go to your messaging tab on your phone <br>  Go to settings and it should say block number. then you will have to enter the number and send it into the network. Sometimes this works and sometimes this doesn't. <br>  <br>  If these girls are telling you they are going to come to your school and beat you up. Then, you need to call the police and report those threats, tell your counselor at your school, or tell your mom.<br>  <br>  The last resort is getting your number changed.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps.

The single, or the A-side of the record would on one side, the other side would be another song, the B-side of the record.<br>  <br>  Although we now rarely use records to distribute new music, when the CDs or MP3s of singles are released, they're released with additional songs, and we still refer to them as B-sides. Usually, these are songs not included on the album or new recordings of other songs.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	I think it's because artists usually record a whole bunch of songs, like 20-30 and only 10-12 can show up on the album, so the other songs that aren't on the album are called B-sides. They are released with the single. Like on a CD which only has that one song and the B-side.|`|uCr1uiIuaa	B side songs are song not generally released for radio play.  The term originates from vinyl albums, on which the top singles were on the top (or A side) and other songs, to validate the price and demonstrate the band's musical prowess were imprinted on the B side.
zgw1CbVDaa	Sorry, but you can't use unlocked phones with US Cellular.  US Cellular is a CDMA provider, which doesn't use sim cards.  US Cellular prorates the early termination fees.  It goes down every month that you have service with them.  Your friend was most likely close to the end of her contract.  Sorry, but it isn't very likely that they will budge on the termination fee.  I moved back to south TX from Iowa, and they wouldn't waive the termination fees even though they don't have service themselves here(it's all roaming out here).  I am paying my termination fees and am very happy to be off of their horrible service and back on T-Mobile.

It creates a big list of all of your songs and you check the ones you want to send to the hard drive. It works on this for a while and sends the music to folders arranged by artist. Unfortunately you have to go into iTunes and add each folder to the library, but it beats having to download the songs again.|`|r7tzSp9caa	Hi, here is an easy way.

Google "iDump"

AA11256390	Work through this link, it's from BT's faults page. It give easy checks and solutions to try and then an online fault reporting service if they don't resolve the problem  http://bt.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bt.cfg/ph...|`|A4P3ot4xaa	Disconnect the Sky box but leave the PC connected and try it then. If the problems persist then the modem on the sky box could be faulty or the PC
J6rgEiZoaa	1050 has 10.1 mega-pixels instead of 8, hyper crystal2 lcd screen(it worth the extra money if you live in a sunny place like Greece) and features like iAuto. It is also faster. If the difference is only 50 dollars take it. I have experience with many Olympus cameras (1010, 1020, 700, 740, 1030 and more) but not with this model. I am very satisfied with Olympus, they are a great choice.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	canon is coming out with one<br>  check it out<br>  D10<br>  canonusa.com<br>  <br>  more features on the 1050

dSaDG765aa	Hello  on this page you get  the solution for your problem!    http://www.smps.us/pcb-design.html
Eazlb9Kdaa	you could have a short or ground on the line. <br>  try using a different phone from a different outlet.<br>  than go outside and see if you see any wires down. <br>  if nothing, go online and check for an outage.<br>  <br>  if all fails you know what to do :)|`|4G41Z3RJaa	Do you have more than one phone?  The Telco should have placed a demarcation point that separates the Telco responsible cable from the cable that you are responsible to repair.  Take a phone to a neighbour and make sure that it works.  Try calling your home number, if it rings then it is an open line, if the number is busy then it is a short or a ring ground.  Then go to the demarcation point and disconnect your inside wiring from the Telco wiring, it is usually a small telephone RJ-11 patch cord.  Plug in the phone to the Telco side and test it, if the phone works then you have a problem inside the house, if the phone does not work then the Telco has to fix their problem.<br>  If the phone works then you will have to find the problem inside the house.  Plug back in the patch cord.<br>  <br>  When you dialed your number was it busy or ring no answer.  If it was ring no answer, then you are looking for a broken cable somewhere.  Check all of the connections that you can see, and look for any damage.  If you find a broken cable that is probably the problem.  If the number was busy you are looking for something that is shorting out the line.  Check all of your jacks, sometimes dust will get into a jack and moisture will gather and short the line.  Look for anything that has fallen on top of connections, look for cut wires as the cut ends might be touching.  Look for cables under water as that may short out the cable.<br>  Good luck.
cAOS9Vlfaa	Two possibilities<br>  <br>  the power could be going wrong on the system<br>  get a new cord and plug it into a different outlet (i would try changing the outlet first!)<br>  <br>  another reason is it might be over heating.<br>  get it into a spot that is more open so the ps3 can get better air flow.<br>  <br>  If this still does not work then you'll have to go to sony with your problem but above will probably get the situation out of there<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|7Asyl4Guaa	let it cool down for a while and then try again. and turn up your a/c and let it cool.|`|Eazlb9Kdaa	seems like a power issue. get a new cord and see if that will fix the issue.<br>  also do not put the ps3 in enclosed location it will get too hot and start messing up.<br>  <br>  if nothing else go to sony thats ur best bet.|`|szvL591iaa	go to SONY: problem solved

HY22vMOhaa	Try holding the DOWN & CENTER button for 10 second and i may restart itself. Hope this helps.|`|0vF6WM7Eaa	First just make triple sure its unlocked then hold down the middle and play button until the Apple logo pops up. It might take up to 25 seconds so just keep trying. If it wont reset try plugging it into the charger or the computer. That can kind of wake up the system to get it going. If that still doesn't work try taking it into an Apple store or calling the hotline (1-800-APL-CARE)|`|aac66249d7b05db052b5126fe9e870bcaa	on my ipod i hold the down and center button and it will turn off then turn it back on and it shouldn't be froze anymore.
