qwmuwn5uaa	I am so sorry that you are feeling so poorly.  Please go to the hospital emergency room.  Just tell them exactly what you just said here.  You are too young to have heart pains and all the other symptoms.   You need to see a doctor that is not interested in a quick diagnosis, like your family doctor.  In the emergency room they probably run a few tests that will determine if there is anything extremely serious with you.  But please go now.  It is much better to be safe than sorry.  If there is nothing medically wrong with you maybe you should review what you are putting into your body.  Are you eating healthy.  Maybe you are starving your body of important vitamins and nutrients.  At the hospital the blood test will probably show any deficienties.   Please go and I will say a prayer for you.   Best wishes.|`|d24443b8ec2e2ad458375b4a24f5d89eaa	If you're that worried you need to keep going until a doctor can piece together what's happening.

It's a much healthier way to loose weight than starving yourself.|`|AA12078924	None of these work long term so try this:<br>  <br>  Okay. Cut out eating in between meals.<br>  Only eat healthy food and cut down on Carb’s like bread, potatoes, pasta's, rice etc.<br>  Then walk an hour every morning two hours after a meal and the same in the afternoon.<br>  If you can jog in between both sessions you'll burn even more calories.<br>  You should lose and continue to lose more weight as you go.<br>  <br>  As long as you can stay off junk food and eating in between meals.|`|AA10701512	Well i wouldn't know since I'm skinny but you should ask your doctor.

Und die Behauptung zum Arzt zu gehen, wenn man die Grippe hat, reicht aus..na ich weiss ja nicht..vorbeugen ist immer besser als heilen...im übrigen wird nicht jede Grippe im Ansatz wahrgenommen, wenn ich diese dann verschleppe, sind Herzmuskelentzündungen keine Seltenheit!<br>  <br>  Unten noch ein Link mit Hinweisen zur Herstellung!

Gwrvan3oaa	Il existe des solutions autres que la médication : des chercheurs australiens conseillent certains aliments pour ce qu'ils apportent : Oméga-3 (amandes, saumon), folates (épinards, melon), tryptophane (lait, volaille), vitamines B6 (lentilles, poivron) et B12 (abats, oeufs), le magnésium (eaux minérales, noisettes, chocolat) et le fer (viande rouge, boudin, moules) sont aussi efficaces puisque en manquer augmente la fatigue, l'irritabilité, l'anxiété et la nervosité.<br>  Manger du sucre entra?ne également une décharge de sérotonine.<br>  Par contre il faut limiter la consommation d'oméga-6 (huiles de pépins de raisin, de ma?s, de noix).<br>  <br>  Faire du sport aide aussi à lutter contre la dépression : l'activité physique déclenche la sécrétion, par le cerveau, d’endorphines (cousine de la morphine) qui chassent les tensions et la douleur.<br>  La course est un sport vivement recommandé contre la dépression : courir pendant un minimum de 10 minutes entra?ne une décharge de sérotonine qui aide a lutter contre la dépression.

d77lkU86aa	Hi there, <br>  Not sure how you managed to pull your muscle in the way you mentioned, but our bodies act in strange ways!<br>  Sounds like you over stretched it, which is fine, and will heal up fine. When you stretch a muscle out or pull it, it just need a little while to heal, should be fine in a few days or so. For now, you need to continue to massage it, and if you can get a wheat pack, or hot water bottle, then use that on your calf, but cover the water bottle with a towel first to avoid burning it. Heat and massage will do the trick nicely. Take a long soak in the bath too, that  always helps. you should take some paracetamol too, these will lessen the pain for the moment. Hope this helps.|`|n5W260SEaa	my friend had the same experience and it ended up being a tear in her calf muscle. she went to the doctor and was told to keep off of it (crutches for 2 weeks) ice and rest. after 2 weeks she was fine and perfectly healed! good luck!

Not to mention your inhaling with a cigarette not with cigars.  You smoke less cigars and smoking a cigar is like a commitment you need a good 20-30 minutes to enjoy it. Cigars are also rolled in a natural leaf.|`|FQYWBbmGaa	That is like asking which is worse. Being hit by a bus or an 18 wheeler?

6pf43Aisaa	Sounds like you have TMJ (Temporo-Mandibular Joint), it is arthritis of the jaw bone. You need to see a specialist that deals with that.<br>  <br>   I will warn you though, many insurances do not cover this specialist/doctor. My mom is going thru the same thing and the doctor told her that many insurance co. will not pay for services. She is going for the shots which is $75. / shot! + $100 just to walk in the door. <br>  <br>  It is very important to get this checked out because, it will only get worse and it will effect your bite, which will interfer with eating.|`|4Ye8kVuRaa	These are classic symptoms of TMJ, which is a disfunction of the jaw joint basically.  You can try anti imflammatory med like advil or aleve.  You also could try a mouth guard to wear at night.  But, probably need to see one of these professionals, a dentist , a doctor or even a chiropractor.  Good Luck!!  I know that it is a painful disorder.|`|ftSXiaKIaa	You might have TMJ.......but I'm not of the medical profession.

Also If you sleep on your stomach and your head to the side to puts a lot of pressure on your jaw and puts it out of alignment. I just woke up one day in a lot of pain and unable to open my jaw very much. Talk to your Dr. or dentist. My insurance covered the specialist because I was in pain and it was impairing my health (I couldn't really eat). good luck.|`|azGy1A0kaa	You very well may have nerve damage and may need a root canal.  See your dentist.  If your dentist says that you need a root canal, you can normally schedule with a specialist the same day.
MhvlBK2saa	yes, it sounds like you might have "Restless Legs Syndrome".  I've had it for years and hate it.  Check this info:<br>  <br>  Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that is characterized by the irresistible urge to move the legs. In order for you to be officially diagnosed with RLS, you must meet the criteria described in the four bullets below:<br>  <br>  You have a strong urge to move your legs which you may not be able to resist. The need to move is often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. Some words used to describe these sensations include: creeping, itching, pulling, creepy-crawly, tugging, or gnawing. <br>  Your RLS symptoms start or become worse when you are resting. The longer you are resting, the greater the chance the symptoms will occur and the more severe they are likely to be. <br>  Your RLS symptoms get better when you move your legs. The relief can be complete or only partial but generally starts very soon after starting an activity. Relief persists as long as the motor activity continues. <br>  Your RLS symptoms are worse in the evening especially when you are lying down. Activities that bother you at night do not bother you during the day|`|4mcFd5Juaa	Sounds like growing pains to me. I got those at that age.|`|FQje3G3faa	RLS.<br>  but also question for you..........why do you keep changing your age? first your 15 than 19 and then you have a 15 year old daughter?????????? i looked at your previous questions.|`|qzTPb08taa	Maybe your leg is just "falling asleep."

R4WX5twzaa	That's excellent that you guys are doing cardio -- it's the most effective form of weight loss. What I do along with exercise is portion control. Instead of going back for seconds, I stick with my one portion of food. I also eat several very small meals throughout the day to give my motabolism a boost, instead of three regular-sized meals. Also, I don't snack on junk food. Instead, I'll have a little cup of yogurt or a few pieces of cheese or some fruits/veggies. All healthy choices. Good luck to both of you!! ^_^!!|`|23ea9912f910c6aeb7e7c3ce4bd5b488aa	Hi,    I developed my own diet because the other diets did not seem to make sense to me, I am a great believer in common sense.    I believe that the "hunger sensation" we feel indicates that our body is starting to consume the fat it has stored in reserve (you definitely WOULD feel this sensation if it was happening wouldn't you?)    So let yourself feel hungry from time to time and when you DO eat, NEVER fill yourself or your body will store the excess as fat.    Also eat what you feel like eating but keep the volume down.    Good luck    Stephen Birchall  Author of "The Birchall Diet"

I feel so alone now, and I don't know how to break that feeling..."  At least that way he'll know your true feelings, make sure you be totally honest.

For example, if you had on panties..even with dry humping he could be pushing it in the hole.

I did nto bleed my first time.  They told me mine could have broke becasue I was active in cheerleading and sports and stuff.  The fact that you broke up with his is not a bad thing.  How about he deserves to have his butt kicked for trying to force you to have sex!  He violated you.  don't talk to him again.  I don't like him :(  Also maybe you need a true friends if they will laugh at you.  You should be able to talk to your "friends" about anything.

f04zmzObaa	I've got mono right now, just diagnosed a couple days ago. I'm also a bio-med major. Unfortunately, there's no way to speed up the process of getting over mononucleosis. It usually takes about 4-6 weeks for the body to force the virus into dormancy (since its caused by the epstein-barr virus and is present in the patient for a very long time, usually lifetime). The only thing you might be able to to boost your immune system is take lots of vitamins. B12 for energy (so even though you're still infected, you won't feel as tired and miserable) and C to promote healthy immune responses. Just don't overdo it, stay in bed. Its a virus! they don't go away easily. Just rest and drink lots of fluids. Try getting a prescription for prednisone (it will help reduce swelling of the spleen and tonsils) or another steroid so that you'll feel better. I'm on it now, and it helps loads.     Hope i helped =]|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Well when I had mono I had it for a month and a half straight, and it doesn't mean you can't see him just don't kiss him. And how did he get mono anyways? You can only get it from making out with someone who has it. That is why they call it the kissing disease.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	mono can last weeks to months, depending on the person.  No way to speed up the illness as far as I can tell.  It is a virus that is contagious so you can see your boyfriend but I wouldn't kiss, or share cups, etc.  Just simple general precautions as with other infectious illnesses.  Look it up on one of those MD web sites for more info and like the other poster said, do what the doctor said.  Plenty of rest and fluids.  Your boyfriend will feel like crap anyway so he may sleep alot or just lay around, which is a good thing.    Ashamed 2 is wrong, you can get it other ways besides kissing.  shaking hands with someone infected and then touching your own mouth or nose or eyes, sharing a can of pop or a cup or glass.  read up on it before accusing anyone of anything.|`|b51ef232e3427ecee90730da4fd4f58daa	Mono can have a very different effect for different people - follow doctors advice!  And if the doctor says that your friend's spleen is enlarged then definitely do NOT ignore what the doctor says to do.  There is a very rare complication of ruptured spleen (& death) with mono.
s6stLtvLaa	It varies from people to people.  I got the virus from my birth mother and I am now 24 and my immune system is still great and my doctor sees me living for a long time.  When I was in high school I knew someone who also had the virus from birth and died when they were 14.      You also have to take into account what strand of virus a person gets.  Someone can get a strand that is resistant to all of the HIV medication and is a fast acting virus.  Or, someone (like me) can have a clean strand that isn't resistant to any of the medication.      Then, it depend on how healthy a person is.  Other than the HIV and being a little overweight I have nothing else wrong with me.  If I exercise, get the weight off and eat healthy then I can live for a long time.  But, then again, something could go wrong in the next year and I could die in a year or 2.  There is no set time frame anymore since we have all of the medication available to us today.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Depends upon : 1) when it was contracted; 2) physical condition of the person at the time of being infected; 3) how soon it turns into full blown AIDS; 4) age at which the person contracted HIV; 5) how long it was before learning one had HIV.|`|9vmnr0iQaa	Depends when they die..    oh wait i mean when they get HIV|`|bP5zyipXaa	depends on the person and how well they take careof their selves like taking their meds eating right sleeping enough getting regular check ups look at magic johnson positive for over 20 years|`|DlMsJPwUaa	People infected can live healthy lives if they take enough medicines and stay healthy|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Unfortunately, there is no exact answer, because the length of life of someone who has HIV depends on several factors, including the person's health prior to HIV infection, their response to the virus itself, their response to medications, and whether or not they are seeing a specialist and taking meds as prescribed.  However, many people  who have HIV are living much longer, healthier, due to current treatments.  Most people who have HIV have no symptoms for several years after they get infected.|`|AA10727113	Truth being that there isn't a set time limit.  There are alot of factors that come into play.  When it was found, how advanced it has gotten, medications, etc etc etc.  There are plenty of people who live close to a normal life expectancy just by taking care of themselves and doing what they can to improve their own health.  HIV is a horrible disease to have but it's no longer a death sentence like it was years ago.
LJwhaNIDaa	Tylenol has been implicated in acute and chronic liver toxicity, sometimes resulting in death.      The level that induces toxicity is unpredictable and likely rooted in an individual's personal and unique biochemistry.     Never ever drink alcohol or take cold or cough medicines that contain alcohol while using Tylenol as this can be a lethal combination that sometimes causes acute liver failure.     Here is a link describing Tylenol toxicity issues:    http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/10...     In addition, there are natural pain relievers, without side effects that you might want to try.  I have listed some below with links:     Feverfew and Butterbur:  Both known to help with migraine headaches.    Boswellia Serrata: can be used for generalized pain as well as headache pain.  It also offers some liver protection.     Here's a link regarding Boswellia:    http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...    Other helpful pain relief nutrients are: MSM and S adenosyl methionine(SAME).  Both can be used for muscle pain and generalized inflammation including certain types of headache pain.     http://altmedicine.about.com/cs/headache...    Show this information to you parents before taking any of the natural remedies.     You might also want to visit a nutritionally savvy doctor for guidance and to ensure that you are not taking medications that would contraindicate the use of the nutritional and herbal remedies.|`|SOAZOM7haa	The best advice i can give you is to see a docter or something, but one of my friends almost overdosed and I think that you need like 60 pills. Hope it helps.    ^.^|`|AA10616287	3 or 4 probably won't be enough to be considered an overdose, but over the long term of constantly taking these pills day after day you are probably hurting your liver.  Tylenol has been linked to liver damage (especially if taken with alcohol).  You should see a doctor about the recurring headaches. There could be a serious problem that needs to be seen about before hurting yourself more with the self-medicating.|`|KojH3RiUaa	As long as you don't take the whole bottle or something stupid like that you should be okay, Remember, though, it's not about the quantity. 2 should do it. If you keep getting chronic headaches like this then perhaps you should go to your doctor.       :)|`|ehBPus3Zaa	The total milligrams you can consume in a 24 hour period is 4,000. If you go over that, you risk damaging your liver because that is where it is processed in your body. My nephew accidentally took too much because of the flu, and he was in the hospital for a week. His enzymes were messed up and he can't take anything with Tylenol ingredients for 6 months. He almost died!

6CQ3FmA6aa	Hi
1CQISjMIaa	You shouldn't have sex. That makes it less painful ;]  Good Luck!|`|R6IYY4miaa	Yes, sex hurts the first time. There's not a lot you can do about it except stretch your muscles. A good way to do this is to practice stopping and holding your urine flow while you're peeing. Do this for a couple of months, and then talk to your doctor before having sex. If you're actually asking where his penis goes then there's a lot of other stuff you probably don't know but definitely NEED to know before going this direction. Talk to a medical profession, and practice on those muscles. That's really all you can do.|`|AVzCvK1zaa	17 is not old enough. Especially if you don't even know where his penis goes. That's just sad. Have you not had sex ed? or a health class at least? Jesus, what is the world coming to? Don't have sex. Just wait. If you've waited this long, you can wait longer.|`|aAHVsJEvaa	if you dont you u r too naive for sex anyways.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	First, if you have to ask where the penis goes... you're not old enough.  The first time will hurt depending on your hymen.  Mine was super tight and I had to have surgery.  Some feel a bit of discomfort and others feel a lot of pain.    Your age doesn't matter if you don't know where the penis goes.... you're still not old enough.|`|6ZZAvyHNaa	To not make it hurt, practice with your fingers days before.... Your boyfriend is bigger than your fingers, so imagine that.    If it hurt girls before, it's because they havnt popped their cherry or ''fingered themself'''....    For me, it didn't hurt, but it sure ''stretched''... It can be considered a ''good pain''////      good luck, protect yourselves!|`|T6VePfb4aa	hahahah if you dont know where it goes im pretty sure ur not ready!!! LMAO|`|CSPKKFunaa	U r not old enough also u don't even know where the penis goes. LOL|`|edBU6kkAaa	Hi - i'm assuming you didn't have sex ed classes at school and nobody has had the 'birds and the bees' talk with you then.    If you feel ready, then that's fine, but don't do it just because your boyfriend wants it, it needs to be a mutual feeling 100%    basically you have 3 holes, urethra (front), Anus (back) and vagina (middle) - he's aiming for the middle!     I don't remember any pain when I lost my virginity which either means that it didn't hurt or it was so minor I have forgotten it but I think that is because we made our first time count and we spent a lot of time using foreplay - i'd recommend this rather then going straight for it, because this will give you a true sense of whether you are ready or not.    Don't worry if your first time wasn't the mind blowingly orgasmic experience of sex that you see on TV and such, it can take time for you both to explore what work and what doesn't work for you both    Remember always use protection!    Good Luck     x    EDIT: I think it is a little cruel for people to be laughing - if your not told these things, then how are you supposed to know - at least she has had the sense to research it and other people's experiences rather than let her boyfriend tell her how it all works!

AA10358331	All shaving does is cuts the hair off at the skin. Like the hair on your head, the hair all over your body grows everyday. You only notice it more because the hair is short. Using products like Nair just melt the hair just below the surface, which in returns grows back in just a couple of days.  If you want a longer lasting result. Wax it! Waxing taking the hair out at the root, so it takes longer to go back. Plus all the hairs don't grow at the same time, thus it feels like there is less hair growing back.  More a more permanent solution there's always laser hair removal, but that gets expensive.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	You're hair is going to grow back the next day, if not sooner.  I know if I shave in the morning, I tend to be a bit stubbly by the end of the day.  You're never going to get that smooth hairless feeling unless you wax.  And I mean, have a professional wax you, not those cheap kits from the store.  Good luck!

yjNCovncaa	I just had all of my wisdom teeth removed yesterday, and I am happy to tell you, there is nothing to be nervous about. I was like you, extremely paranoid; filled with anxiety. I hate th dentist and I hate needles even more. I didn't think I could go through with this surgery, but I sucked it up and went through with it. And it wasn't bad at all. My appt. was at 7:45A.M. I got to the office, filled out about 2 papers regarding information, and then I was called to the surgery room. I sat in the operating chair, and I kid you not, it didn't even take 30 seconds before 4 oral surgeons came into the room and commenced with the operation. They asked how I was doing, I replied by saying 'nervous'. They started strapping me into the chair, which made me freak out. So they put a mask over my face filled with laughing gas to try and relax me. Then they clamped both of my index fingers to some machine to monitor my heart rate. At this point, the main oral surgeon introduced himself, and let me know what was going on and that I was going to be fine. Next, he stuck with the needle, this was to administer the anesthesia, which was the worst part. But they numb the are with cold water so it is just a little prick. The want you to come to the office in shorts and a short sleeve shirt so they can find the proper area to administer the drug. For me, they administered it, stuck me with the needle, in my right arm by the elbow. So lets recap, I'm strapped to the chair, receiving laughing gas to calm me down, hooked up to a heart rate monitor, and stuck with an IV to administer anesthesia. So next, they started taking my blood pressure on my left arm. I asked the main surgeon was going on, and he replied by saying, 'they're taking your blood pressure'. I suppose at that point I was administered the anesthesia, or it finally took effect, I don't know, because I don't remember anything after that. The next thing I know, I am in my kitchen with my father, my mouth filled with gauze. It was so crazy! But there are a few parts I vaguely remember. I remember, I suppose this was after the surgery, I was sitting on a bench in the some hallway, with someone holding my  hand. I also remember someone helping me into my car, and telling me I can't workout for a week. But thats all I remember. So please don't be worried. It is not bad at all. Once you get home, you will be extremely tired and groggy for a while. Your mouth will also be numb. Some things will be hard to remember, and you will be like this for about 2 more hours. What else can I tell you... you will be numb from the Novocaine for most of the day. You need to replace the gauze in your mouth every 30 minutes or so. Drink lots of water even though it will be hard. I am being honest when I say there is little pain as well. It will throb, but it is nothing unbearable. If does become extremely hard to sustain, you can take your Vicodine. Also, remember to take your antibiotics the next day to prevent infection. Oh! You need an ice pack for the first day, to reduce swelling. What I did was leave it on my face, wrapped in a t-shirt, for one hour, and then one hour off, then repeat. You will also be given medication to reduce swelling; take it. For the first few days, all you will be able to eat is ice cream, yogurt, pudding, J-ello, Popsicles, etc. Sounds good, eh? It get to you after a while, just in the sense that it becomes boring, gives a headache, and you don't want to eat it anymore. The worst part of this whole thing for me is that I cannot work out or exercise for an entire week, which pisses me off. You have to take it easy, which is not something I'm used to. I usually go out and about, constantly keep myself busy. But I have to sit around the house for an entire week eating the same food, doing nothing.. thats the worst part. Don't be scared :)  If you are, just email me and I'll clear anything up or answer any other questions! GOOD LUCK!|`|db173bc788dfd2eb3c07352c9e48f609aa	there is a lot of ways, but i'll keep it simple for you.<br>  <br>  Usually they administer it via shot in the arm. You cant even feel it its like getting a shot from the pediatrician for tetnis or something. Its a little pinch dont worry. <br>  <br>  and what they usually do is tell you to count backwards from 100, but before you reach 90 you'll be passed out haha. Don't stress. before you know it you'll wake up in the recovery room wondering wtf happened.|`|JydoVUreaa	If they are doing IV sedation or general anesthesia they will typically give you one shot in the arm, that will have a small catheter. The catheter will stay in your arm and thats how they will give you all of the meds. That way they only 'stick' you once. You'll drift off to a sleep like state. They want you to wear shorts/tshirt so that they can put the blood pressure cuff, and heart monitors, etc. on you easily.|`|FkZfF6Iwaa	Dude you'll be allright, it doesn't hurt a bit, it will only hurt a little while the day after or a couple of days.

vPkAjWoJaa	Well sounds like your doing great so far keep up the good work. First thing stick with people who are confident and not negative once you start hanging out with those types of people then most people tend to get lazy and follow suite with them. So stay focused and on track if you live close to the gym walk there and back you are young so make sure your parents know the exact route your taking and how long it actually takes to get there. Make sure you call them when you leave and make sure you call them when you get there.   Food:  yogurt, special k is good but you might want to mix it up get some oatmeal, if you like to snack check out this website below there is plenty of nutritious bars and drinks that would blow your mind on the ingredients.  Water is a key thing to success you have to drink water if you don't like regular water look on this website there is somethings on there that are called twist tubes from nutrilite there is some for immune antioxidants and so forth check it out they are really good.  you should try to eat fish once a week if you can tolerate it if not eat chicken more then red meat.  drinking orange juice is great   get yourself a body ball and do crunches or if you have bands lay them underneath and then use them you have to be imaginative when it comes to working out.

Yogurt is also a good choice as well as wheat toast with jelly and a small amount of butter ( 1/2 a tsp) either can be accompanied with a glass of juice or milk.  I would have another small snack between meals such as a granola bar and with a bottle of water, tea, or juice. Maybe even a fruit smoothie instead (look up recipes on the net!).  Lunch (you don't have to cut out all meats just the super fatty ones! Beef and Pork) I would have chicken (not breaded, preferably roasted or grilled) or a tuna sandwich on wheat bread. For side dishes I would consider eating some veggies or a small salad, with low-fat dressing, or a fruit salad with some yogurt as dressing if a veggie salad doesn't please you. Juice, water, tea, or milk.  (insert small snack!) ;)  For dinner you could eat fish (salmon or such) or eat chicken covered in a low fat and low-sodium gravy (same as lunch) with steamed veggies or white rice (steamed). Dessert can include a delicious fruit smoothie or a cup of yogurt.  Remember, you don't have starve yourself! Keep track of you calorie intake! try a calorie intake of 1600. Count calories, write down what you eat and the calories for how many servings you've consumed on list. I've done that last year I lost about 15 pounds in 3 months (5 lbs per month, that's not bad!)  Okay with the excercise, you don't have to go to a gym or have exercise equipment! Go outside, run around, hang with friends and play some backyard sports, maybe even tag, lol. If it's snowy and cold go have a massive snow ball fight with your siblings or friends, go sledding (walking back up a steep hill takes work!) Instead of sitting on the couch watching tv, lift some hand weights while you do it or lay on the floor and do crunches. Have fun with it don't make seem like a chore!   I hope this helps you out! :)  Use the source, that helped me out when I want to shed the pounds and live healthy!

q0nhx3veaa	I have this problem alot with my boyfriend.    Mines generally from the dryness. Rubbing it raw down there, you know and yeah the acid in your pee can make that burn.    Just make sure your always really wet.    Good luck!|`|L6DFPXo6aa	Make sure it's not an allergic reaction to condoms or lubrication or something.|`|qFNv8AKCaa	I would have said it's UTI ( Urinary track infection) but it's not because its not a constant pain when you pee. But it might be possible that you are very sensitive in your area or that yes you might have a cut in the vaginal area you might want to go to the doctors and get a check up.
2k5x2wzJaa	Try Throat coat tea by Traditional Medicinals, also try to suck on zinc lozenges and slippery elm lozenges.  If you think it might be turning into a cold or viral, then spray some zinc or colloidal silver on the back of the throat.  Boost up your immune system with vitamin c in divided dosages, and try echinecea.|`|TVNIxpVgaa	Sore throats are torcher.  I think I can help you.  At the first sign of a sore throat, go to your pharmacy and ask for Lactinex tablets.  They keep them in their refrigerator.  They are chewable Acidophiles tablets.  Keep them in your refrigerator once you get them home.  Chew one up and let it trickle down your throat slowly.  Do this three times a day till your sore throat is gone but the soreness is usually gone within an hour or two.  Aciidophiles is a good bacteria that is replaced for the bad bacteria that causes the sore throat.    Good health to you,    Gwynn E.|`|JdjKsuYvaa	The only thing that really works for me is Bee Propolis throat spray. And believe me, i tried them all :)|`|AA11173395	Hot Slippery Elm tea (coats the throat, instantly soothing) with lots of fresh squeezed organic lemon juice (antiseptic) and raw local honey (antibiotic).    Traditional Medicinals makes a good slippery elm tea called Throat Coat.  You can find it at health food stores, large grocery stores, and GNC.|`|Ds3G8yVxaa	if you had for that long then you should go to the doctors office to see if you have strep throat. If you don't then have some tea with honey in it,some Sugar, and lemon concentrate. Gargle warm salt water. Then you take two halls cough drops every hour and cough medicine. It may not taste good but you want to kick that cold right out of you.|`|MXRXG62oaa	swallow some honey it will help a bit|`|xfpFimGYaa	My brother has it its killing him|`|i7oGjwJBaa	warm salt water will help over time, but it's not an instant miracle.  especially to help get to sleep - try swallowing a spoonful of honey, and don't drink anything else to wash it down.  during the day, i drink as much green tea with honey as i can - it really does help;  but honestly - nothing is instant.  your body is fighting whatever nasty germs are in there and it will take care of it in it's own time.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Bad how?    Both put stress on certain bones, joints, and ligaments, but proper form and decent shoes prevent impact injury.    Jogging does not tax the cardiovascular system as much as running, meaning you won't become as fit from it, but since you can do it far longer, the duration offers other benefits like endurance and calorie burning.    Do whichever you like. Switching back and forth between different types of workouts provides an extra challenge to your body, they say.|`|CguqxpvBaa	both are good i prefer running though|`|jw6Lpt37aa	not at all they are the best workout of all times jogging or running they are both good for your body and burning fat around the waist and belly and will tone the thighs specially for women but you need to do that with cutting the calories intake of food for best result|`|28qmqsySaa	no to is not true    so jog, run...go have fun        smile  good luck|`|BRT2teSqaa	I never heard that, and I dont see how it would be true.

It happened to me when i left a home after living in it for more than 9 years....    U just have to make the place (where u now live), more friendly to u... Go out for fresh air, mixup with ppl there, do your fav things like dancing, painting, anything tht u wud love to.... and u vl start feeling urself more comfortable here...|`|AA10836316	Thats normal, You have temporarily lost part of your independence. It was not only YOUR home, but it was your way of saying I am on my own.  Cheer up. It will only be temporary.

You had a routine that has now changed and I guess that is a little unsettling too.  Once you find a new place to live you should feel better.

But you're current size is the upper range for your height.|`|9fvqwsOPaa	actually, if they're saying your fat, they're probably jealous! and also, from what i've seen, most guys like a bit of **** to grab on to. work it while you've still got it, cuz one day you'll wake up, and no matter what weight you are, it all hits the floor!|`|rax7ray4aa	dont care what people say , theyre full of **** and theyre jealous trying to make u feel bad   so if u just listen to them ur personality is getting weaker  and no UR NOT FAT  ur perfectly fine :)|`|UpPWXRK4aa	Nobody that's a size 4 is anywhere near fat.

So yes, dont try going down that low. I think your size is perfect.

You dont need to loose alot of weight, your size is perfect (=|`|JqDqfz0Saa	I'm 5'5 too, but I weight 140 and I fell a bit fat at times. I wish to go down to like 130.    No you are not fat, some people (esp. teen girls) will say "Your fat".. how can they say thay if they havent seen you? People are silly, just do what you want to and don't worry about dumb people that don't even know you or vice versa.|`|diAqosiIaa	WHY DO U CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY!!!! grow up and stop caring what people say!!! of course they are gonna say something to make you feel bad about yourself!!!!!|`|elAfZpqaaa	Can you run fast???

BRT2teSqaa	I dont get what youre asking because you already know how not to ruin your day.  You said it:  to eat 150-250 calories for dinner.  Just read lables.  That can be a bowl of soup, a salad with chicken breast, or even some cereal.|`|Q0SrsXzfaa	www.lose-tummyfat.com|`|Ef3VReezaa	weight watchers doesnt work my aunt tried do jenny craig|`|JRiKYi0Aaa	Skip dinner or drink some milk.|`|xQlCxeEWaa	I would go for warm oatmeal with some fruit or maybe 2 slices of bread with jam and a drink of juice.|`|UpPWXRK4aa	No more junk food. Just eat 250 of whatever you have left that's healthy and you will be fine, even you said it.
AA11785060	Lots of guys experiment, but don't get caught.  If an adult, or an older teen you can get charged with indecent exposure, as well as be required to register as a sex offender--- even for just having solo sex!  So be careful.  The woods are nice, by the way.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	As long as it's in private, and no-one can see or hear you, then it's O.K.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	anywhere private|`|ZvW8dvt4aa	Its fine, just don't masturbate in public.|`|2aK9IJbiaa	any where as long it is not done in public and in front of young children|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Yup. Just not in class (although a *few* people report having done it. As for restroom, make sure the door is locked (obviously) and that the relative noise of the place covers any noise you might make.     Some people also talk about doing it in the woods near their place; at night; up a tree; in a plane's bathroom/train/bus, etc.     It seems to be where the risk of getting caught is small to moderate at best, rather than opening masturbating, which naturally has bigger consequences if caught.     Happy jacking whichever way you do it.|`|tSX9wMBEaa	If you really feel the urge to masturbate, as in you're unbelievably excited, then the best thing to do is to masturbate in a restroom. Even when you're at home and only your mom is home with you, for example. Better safe then sorry, and there's no other feeling like the humiliation that comes when you get caught masturbating. Trust me.|`|YCMr0xI4aa	that is gross do that in your bedroom or bathroom|`|eoZJO3J8aa	I would say anywhere.  if i feel the urge of masturbating ill go for it. of course i will find a place to hide first and just masturbate.|`|1f644ebbaa	Do it anywhere private, where ever you feel comfortable
jvW3a5GYaa	Do you think you are skinny, fat, or just right? Body dismorphic disorder has to do with a thin person looking in a mirror and they see a fat person. They don't see their body as it really is - they see themselves much bigger than what they really look like.|`|AA12323302	Ok seriously, you're 13!  Why are you even worried about what you weigh in the first place?  Shouldn't you be worried about doing homework and handing papers in on time or something?  When I was 13 my only worry was graduating 8th grade!  In any case...FYI, 103 is a good weight healthy weight for your height.  You could even put on 10-15 pounds and still be okay.  You're not fat!  I think you have a poor sense of reality and should really talk with your parents about this because its unhealthy for a girl your age to be focused on weight.  Relish in your teenage years while you can and just be a sensible young woman.  Good luck!
a866601a94a7a1716764f0de1f5f846caa	First, you need to be sure that you really are eating a lot.  I sometimes struggle to eat just 2000 calories per day, and the kind of eating required for a male to bulk up (upwards of 2800 cals) makes up more food than most people think.    So, keep track of what you're eating.  Buy a digital food scale, weigh your foods and ingredients for recipes.    To bulk up, try to get 500 more cals a day than you expend.  To calculate this, and get some suggestions for diets, check out the link in my source.  Also, try to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Eat eggs, fish, lean meats, fruit, nuts (almonds, peanuts, walnuts), seeds, oats and protein supplement (www.myprotein.co.uk for UK, www.dpsnutrition.net for USA).|`|uUCH3hJRaa	I'd continue to workout.  Push ups, pull ups, curls, and squats will build muscle. Add a protein shake or 2 to you diet will help you add more calories without a bunch of fat.
L6ZEQxvLaa	I regret I'm not 6' but my little, well not little anymore, church member started his extra growth as a toddler.  His brother is 2 years older than him yet at one year he was standing equal to his brother.  They looked like twins, facial features and height.  When ole boy hit puberty, he sprung up like a bean pole used in a garden.    |`|newfiOPOaa	I was 5 ft tall at 12 yrs. and 6 ft tall at my 15th birthday.  I grew only 1 inch after reaching 15 yrs old.    I had what is referred to as "growing pains" in my legs and back during those three years.
E8Z5PWmcaa	next time you go to reach for something to eat, maybe get a glass of water, or else distract yourself my doing something that requires energy or concentration. You might be eating cus you're bored or cus you're stressed..|`|A6Yth8jHaa	well make sure that whoever buys your groceries limits it to healthy foods. the best way to resist temptation is to get it out of sight. to avoid eating when youre not hungry, try gum. keep it on you all the time and make it a good long lasting flavor.|`|ikm8hJYZaa	Write notes on your refrigirator that are clearly visible.    Something like.    "Do not be a glutton"|`|vFThJxW0aa	right before you eat something think "am i really hungry or am I just bored?"   instead of eating out of boredom have some SUGAR FREE gum or drink some water
kQbjCKNHaa	That's about 125    And the "rule" which isn't always true is 100 pounds at 5 feet tall and 5 pounds for every inch after.  So 125 is perfect for 5'5.    An average height for 5'5 could be anywhere between 112-140 so you're friend is fine.|`|K3irp7xhaa	I don't know depends on what size frame.|`|4cFYbySCaa	No, she is absolutely fine! I am almost 5'6 and weigh 120 lbs (54 kilos). But if she is worried she could tone up a little and build some muscle.
r1nKp9ELaa	you have to drink sooooooo much water you have no idea. dont do any of those weed flushing things. they dont work and theyre bad for you.   i would say drink 2 galons of water a day. and if you can do more, go for it. just dont drink so much you die. cause it is possible, even from water. and of course dont smoke for the next week  hope it works!|`|d6k5pPMoaa	i heard that u shud drink laxatives  or pickle juice  =]|`|fLoFMhDMaa	It takes about 12 hours to completely flush out of your system. So whatever you have in about a week, try not smoking it a day or so before.|`|e2J4r10Raa	First stop smoking or else this won't work. get some niacin tablets from your local pharmacy. take them each day and drink a lot of water. that should clean your system. As an ex-smoker this is the most effective way, trust me this is the best way to clean your system.
SwKPJRNvaa	there's not a vast difference between brands, despite the adverts  any decent one, like the one you take will be fine|`|vPkAjWoJaa	Hey man you need to check out this website below you can find a 10 daily veggies and fruits chewable pill to take and there is no preservatives and such its all natural. Also if you have such a busy lifestyle there is sports bars and drinks well check it out good luck to you.|`|5iOk6Domaa	Have you ever heard of the Mississippi market? Well if you have they have very nice organic vitamins that are safe for teens. I think teens need vitamin c tablets and that gives you clearer skin and better eye sight. Fish oil tablets are a great choice and vitamin D is very good in the winter.     Also you can get vegies in vitamin form in your schedule is way to busy to eat them.|`|wuXzDUGQaa	At 16 if your schedule does not permit you to eat well,I shudder to think of your diet when you are 25!!  You're absolutely right-you don't need to take a pill to get your daily dose of vitamins.I believe the body absorbs nutrients best from it's natural source.   So,try to build your busy lifestyle around a healthy diet-with plenty of fresh fruits,vegetables,whole grains,legumes,lean meat and about 8-10 glasses of water.   Good luck!!

GFJNxKQ6aa	When I stopped taking metformin, I gained all the weight I lost back and my appetite came back. The medicine caused me to have no appetite so I lost a lot of weight on it.
7fYUhsxZaa	well its not the right thing to do  but i have to say its the thing i would probably do :S  but its not the right thing to do because its especially bad to just stop eating - it makes you put on more weight when you do eat  i think you should confront her on why shes being like that - just say something like 'do you think im fat?' and let her know how you feel  hope things get better|`|5BOV76bmaa	Dont stop eating because of her  Tell her to Fu*k off|`|Xa4Ku7bdaa	Very stupid.    You're skinny as hell already.

But explain to her that you are hungry and ask her to take to to your GP and ask him what to do, also tell her that you will talk about it at school and ask your teacher, see her reaction.|`|C88VCkvnaa	No, that would not be a good thing to do. That will just cause problems for you. I think a different solution would be better. Maybe talk to your mom about how you don't like when she puts you down for eating?|`|AA11402528	wow thats fucked up..nice mom you have, not.     you need 3 meals and 2 snacks daily.|`|91jIBXqyaa	No. If youre hungry, eat.

I would just eat and ignore her, she shouldn't behave like this. She doens't have the right to treat you like this. By eating you show her that her remarks haven't effected you.|`|RDZzKsflaa	Not at all! You're obviously a teenager, so you're still growing, you need food. It'd be unhealthy to stop eating just to spite your mum. I can understand that you'd be upset, but I think you need to tell your mum that she's upsetting you. Just go downstairs and get your salad for dinner. If she says anything, tell her that it makes you sad, but don't get angry with her, it make it worse. And don't mention anything about thinking about starving yourself, she'll get worried, maybe she'll get cross with you.|`|b4v2zdHZaa	tell your mom to mind her own business. your nowhere NEAR fat.

6SIjchQUaa	There are absolutely no pros for being anorexic.  You might want to pick a different topic.  That is the truth!    If you want lies you can check the proanna webiste, I am sure they have plenty of untruths about the pros of anorexia.|`|UpPWXRK4aa	Pros... thin obv, umm... people will comment how you are thin,,..  Cons... no energy, your whole world revolves around food, you don't enjoy a lot of the stuff that you used to, you get sick easier because you don't have nutrients/you're unhealthy and can't fight off simple sicknesses.      You don't exactly gain confidence, maybe 5% of the time, but the disorder (disorder, not happy life change) makes you not care about a lot of things you used to care about (you only really care about how many calories you eat everyday and how to make it look like you ate more to your family/friends)|`|LWxymKPqaa	sorry,   there are no pros   don't be anorexic thats all i have to say|`|32cce60233d48410aba79c9383e3d0b3aa	Don't listen to people who say there are no pros. For an anorexivc, there are LOTS of pros. Here are some examples:  It numbs you out so you don't feel. This is good because you're usually so stressed out from life.  It gives you something to dedicate and obsess over. It distracts you from whatever bad things are going on in life  It feels safe. It feels like you are in control of your life and what goes into your body  It releases endomorphins so you feel happy  It makes you feel clean, and dominant, and self controlled, so you feel better about yourself (anorexics hae self-esteem issues)    Oh, a few cons  little energy  heart problems (arithmias, low heart rate)  cold  forced to "recover" then people keep pestering you, which makes life MISERABLE  feel fat anyway  zombie-like attitude  constant fear  constipation  linugo (fur)  osteoporosis  stomach aches/bloating/gassyness
Ir51Eb0Kaa	No, just eat healthy and exercise regularly.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	slim-fast?|`|L6ZEQxvLaa	make sure it has berries (fat burners), whey protein, peanut butter, fruits.    check out The Abs Diet of Men's Health publication by David Zinczencko.    |`|ycaloVnkaa	lol. plz read my other question about shakes and u will find out...|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Shakes with fiber and protein may make you feel full longer so you eat less during the day. The shakes themselves don't cause weight loss though.|`|vPkAjWoJaa	Well most people are gonna tell you fruits and vegetables and they are absolutely right. However if you don't want to go out and buy all those fruits and veggies well then go on the link below and find chewable veggies and fruits it has 10 daily essential fruits and veggies you can't beat that. Then if your into drinks or shakes they also have those on there it might just be cheaper doing that then going shopping and getting all those things.   good luck|`|Q0SrsXzfaa	www.lose-tummyfat.com

I heard for men's magazine, the best exercise for bigger, strong pecs is the 45 degree bench press.|`|tSX9wMBEaa	Push-ups at first, at least ten a day. Then as you get stronger do twenty a day, then thirty, etc., until you can do forty pound bench presses.|`|m16dhfrGaa	How about one of those stretchy things you push both ends on?|`|6wujZ9D7aa	i dont know sorry|`|HDbGE5ECaa	idk

uGIIR9Beaa	While I do not menstruate myself, I do know the biological reason behind your question. :) Here goes.    Lots of girls experience cramps before or during their periods. Cramps are caused by prostaglandins, chemicals a girl's body produces to make the muscles of the uterus contract. The contracting muscles help push the blood out through a girl's vagina during her period.    You probably know periods usually come once a month. Sometimes, younger girls aren't that regular, so they may skip a month. But as a girl's periods get more regular, cramps are more likely.    They can be mildly annoying to extremely painful, and they usually last for a few days. Cramps may worry some girls at first if they don't know they're often a normal part of having a monthly period.|`|912f0a70bd004b30afad1f94c982e49eaa	I think it comes from the uterus contracting to get everything out, kind of like when a woman is in labor just not that bad.|`|76SAdZ19aa	The hormones

I hope you are not allergic to something.    ss|`|2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	put ice on it or a cold pack and drink more water..when your lips become dry it's lack of moisture and cold , or wind on them..Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water daily to keep them from becoming dry and cracked and if you need to be outdoors put on vaseline, Carmex, or Beeswax(what I use) .|`|BKyCstTGaa	They're probably just ticked that you let them get so dry - buy some Burts Bee's and apply it regularly, it works wonders.
tSi10jneaa	All you need to do is follow diet free of dairy, red meat or eggs, alcohol, has to have more fruits and vegetables and water. Occassionally you can eat chicken in moderation that too boiled or roasted.  No fried food and no junk as well.  No artificial sugar at all. It should be like as if you have given up eating pastries and cakes and cookies.  Try lukewarm water with lemon in it everymorning on an empty stomach may be two to three glasses of lukewarm water and nothing should go inside your stomach for an hour after that.  Also avoid overeating and chewing your food making it almost like paste before swallowing.  Avoid very hot showers, water should be almost your body temperature.  Exercise moderatly, running especially.  Hope this helps.|`|FXe5Lv9eaa	Try using Cetaphil wash (it removes excess oils without drying), or go to a dermatologist if it's really bad.|`|SLlmXTlWaa	go to a dermatologist.|`|WJHkPUeRaa	i use something called Clear Pore. it is not very expensive. and it took me a week to have it gone. its from neutrogena. it is a clear bottle with a white cap and blue liquid in it.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Release some excess Testosterone- which is the cause of the back zits.|`|TfLPRwFWaa	acne body washes|`|YcLnaUo1aa	neurtogena body wash|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Sand paper

If someone who cant use eyedrops properly had pink eye, you could always try using their eyedrop.|`|0II2e6I9aa	First, why would you want to get pink eye?  The only way to catch it is to have physical contact with the eyes, tears or surrounding facial structures from an already infected person.

IA5zVfk0aa	mom i got my period :) dont be nervous!|`|5jINw4PGaa	You should tell her. I mean, you need her to get you pads and stuff.|`|CKTbXiBYaa	I waited till my mom asked me and I said um ya mom I had it for like a year(when really i had just gotten it)|`|LZzsDARUaa	just ask her 2 come somewhere where there rn't  any people and say that u got ur period..:)|`|7ilEjRxeaa	You're both ladies  She will understand, it's nothing to be ashamed or embarassed about. Even though I totally know how you feel.  I was nervous to talk about it with her too.    If you're too shy to say it to her face, leave her a letter or an email.  (: It's easier, that's how I did it.|`|weBvwrloaa	Sweetheart, believe it or not, it's not only a mile stone for you in becoming a woman, but it's a huge deal to your mother as well. Secretly, it may even make her a little sad because it's a physical reaffirmation that you really are growing up. Don't be afraid or nervous to tell her. Instead you should seek her advice. Remember that she was in your shoes at one time and views on a woman's cycle have changed vastly since her's started. Be honest with her and tell her straight up, "mom, I've started my period". This way, you two can discuss what type of pad or tampon is best for you and get little things like mydol or pamprin and talk about cramps and what to do to ease them and things like that. Include her. There is nothing to be nervous about.|`|GU6XO0QNaa	just go for it hun she will have them so its no bad|`|FNeCDm3raa	Leave her a note.|`|17a7d8891c81ff8893fa829755087947aa	Don't be scared to tell her.

Please, go talk to her now.|`|claW4UUcaa	just tell her she will understand why your nervous.|`|16bWGB14aa	Just say mom I need to talk you about something and then just tell her she will be glad that you told her and she can buy you the stuff that you need.|`|Da8WCIrjaa	Yes tell her so she can buy you the proper things you need. She'll probably be real happy.|`|76SAdZ19aa	Well first of all lemme start with the word, Congratulations! Just go up to your mom and say that you think you have had your first period. OR write her a letter saying you had your first period and leave it where she could see it and open the letter to read. Try to cut down on salty foods, eat bananas, take warm baths, and take Advil or Tylenol if your cramps start to have a party down there. So good luck and always carry an extra pad/tampon around.|`|fZhqa3Bdaa	I would start talking about puberty questions and then bring it up how old was she when she got her period or just tell her and keep asking he questions she will get the point.....mom I got my period.. or|`|AEkjFTIDaa	The best thing to do is to be upfront and honest with her.  She's a woman too...and this is a fact of life.  She'll understand.  She got her first period once too.|`|XARb9jbbaa	Just tell her!  She went through this too so she would be more than happy!  |`|8ZI62IHkaa	its not a big deal. Ask her to take you to the store for somethings and just grab some tampons of the shelf. I'm sure she'll understand.|`|Qb6vSTfEaa	I never told my mom, haha i just used her stuff, and i guess she eventually figured it out. She was sad i didn't tell her, so just do it, she'll be glad you did, and then you'll be able to get the right stuff. just say mom i get my period :)|`|uxMxWxvuaa	heres the whole conversation------mommy/mom/ma umm im not a little girl any more and im in need of grownup ladie things your mom will say what kind of things you'll say pad /tampons i recomend pads then shell give you a little talk and before you no it every things okay and you'll be glad you took my advice -------and now that you got it  ask your mom to go on a trip to a store or something get a little bag/purse and pack the following things-----2pads 3 tampons pantyliners extra pear of undies and pants hope this helped and good luck = )|`|CSPKKFunaa	TELL HER shes a women|`|ebzHzyL8aa	Personally, when I get mine, I'm not gonna tell her and let her figure it out, cause my mom would understand I don't want to talk about that kind of thing. I'll just tell her when she's going out shopping one day to bring home pads and she'll get it from that, but if you want to tell her and you guys are close, then just go for it, she went through it before.|`|suVljS9Haa	tell her she'll be upset if you don't. she'll be glad that you don't keep secrets and you'll feel closer to her.|`|FUEHshj4aa	just go: "mom i got my period and i just thought that i should let you know" simple as that.
AuL6U51caa	Regular chapstick or carmex should work just fine. Just remember to keep applying it often, and drink lots of water & tea. Try to do this as often as you can, more like once before you go to school, once during school, after you get home, and every 2-3 hours after, or whenever you notice dryness. But 3 should do OK. It's probably mostly the below freezing/below zero weather combined with a bit of a dry skin condition.     ---Ash---|`|AjFA8qIxaa	It sounds like you have dermititis. Yes it can appear on lips. Do you tend to have rough elbows? Thats mostly how it starts.  And most people assume its just dry lips, when its not. But to make sure go see a dermatologist. Try applying a creme thats made for dermititis. Also drink more. Not drinking enough will make it worse.  Put a humidifier in every room. ( a bowl with water will do too)   Hope u feel better! And no, if it really is dermatitis vaseline will make it worse. IT might make your lips feel better for a short time but it will backfire.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	buy a chapstick and a pocket vasline, just use it whenever you start to feel ur lips drying out, which will be a lot more than 3 times a day :)|`|CoBFyszeaa	VASELINE|`|yudWHXx4aa	once or twice a week before bed, exfoliate your lips. dip the corner of a washcloth into warm water and rub your lips in a circular motion. wile your lips are still damp, rub in a very thin layer of creme, then seal it in with vaseline. when you wake up your lips should be pretty hydrated.    continue to use the chapstick, maybe just not so much. only when you need it.

The only thing i could suggest is to just eat a healthy diet and at least then you will reach your full genetic potential.|`|2xa4414maa	Oh dear. Basketball will not make you taller.    Height is one of those things you can't do anything about. You'll either be tall or short, that's all there is to it.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	there is no way to make yourself taller you will just have to wait and see how tall you will be and no I have never heard that skipping gives you bad knees in fact it is a really good cardio workout.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	you can NOT make your self taller|`|K95QGwsSaa	yes basketball makes you taller due to the exercises you are forced to do by your coach!!    by LEONIDAS PEPLIS|`|9r07QgAzaa	I wish..what you asked was true. But unfortunately, it is not.   I used to play basketball a lot. I was national level player. All that hard work but alas! I didn't make me taller (of course i was not playing basketball to get taller).    And same with skipping. It is good form of exercise and makes your leg bones strong.     Your height is not in our hands. Genes play vital role in it.   But continue with basketball and skipping because it is good for you.|`|Y7ok8dgKaa	Genetics is the best indicator.

q0nhx3veaa	Not really that big of a chance.    But totally possible.    It depends on her period. Find out the first day of her last period and you just basically have to wait untill the next one to see if it comes or not.    But personally, I dont think she is.    Good luck!|`|LykjWv6faa	The only way to know is to wait until she gets her period. If she doesn't get her period at the time she's supposed to, then get a pregnancy test.|`|QP7jDLG2aa	No, it is impossible if you did not rip one of the condoms.  If no semen entered in her then there was nothing to fertilize her egg.   Don't stress out about it (:|`|1axi8QUVaa	more than likely no!|`|L6DFPXo6aa	Don't use 2 rubbers at the same time, it causes too much friction and could possibly break.

Ir51Eb0Kaa	You're fine.|`|AA10700407	if you eat more calories than you burn off, you will gain weight and be fat.  it doesn't matter what you do.  vegetarians are usually very slim, but they eat right.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	you body will be gross if you eat a bunch of crap.  plain and simple|`|wdJcfniBaa	Sounds like it's genetic, do one of your parents have big hips/buttocks? If that's the case there's only so much you can do. The only way to lose weight is cardio (which you're doing a lot of) and dieting. Why are you a vegetarian if you don't like veggies? Working out is only going to make more muscle, so i'm not going to give you workout examples. Besides, a lot of guys like skinny girls with big booties, its hot.|`|xWGKB0NZaa	I check my BMI online to make sure I'm in the right weight range. Also, since you're 14 I'm sure your hormones are changing the way you look. Your hips and bum are going to naturally get bigger, and that's not a bad thing. First, men are turned on by women with larger hips because they more likely to produce healthy offspring (this is unconscious). I have a big bum myself, and I actually read an article in a magazine the other day about how women who have bigger buts are healthier.     Also, if you want to try healthier junk food. I eat a lot of Bear Naked Granola. Since it's whole grains it fills you up faster so you don't eat as much. You can also try and limit yourself to eating it once a day.    The articles I posted are about studies about women with bigger hips and how it's better for you. The last thing I posted was about how some women want to get bigger hips and how they can do it--Ha.     You're doing everything possible to stay toned and fit. My roommate just walked in and said he'd bang you because you're athletic and that's hot.|`|HBEi3V1Aaa	it the junk food that your eating.   the fat that's in the junk food goes straight to your bum.   some people that are really sporty some time are big because of a low or medium metabolism.    i'm not sporty at all but i have a high metabolism.   food also gets distributed unevenly at times.  so in your case (no offence) it's going to your bum.   thighs are naturally bigger.  i should also mention i'm 14 too..      it should also debate on your weight.  for 5"6'  a good weight is 120-125 it sounds heavy but its not.    i'm 5"3' and i'm 109     so basically your NOT over weight and the bum thing is fine!|`|dB9fE7gnaa	you probably are skinny, you just think Ur fat because everyone else is anorexic|`|XHSQTUiqaa	don't eat junk food|`|TAMx7qzCaa	I need ur weight.

Why do you eat so much junk food. That is all going to you thighs. You should try eating less junk food. I eat a lot of junk food but I do not gain any weight because I burn it off in the soccer games that I have.|`|KaZGf4PAaa	i'm in a healthy Weight zone and 14 right now and i do it by this eat fruit and if you would eat meat it helps fill you and gives you protein and remember you can't workout at home or you'll be distracted by the t.v. and other things. also don't go to buffets you'll "want to get your moneys worth" and eat to much.
tSi10jneaa	I never thought it is possible to get rid of blackheads just like that. Actually you will have to grow out of it so the best way is just to observe good diet than to overload your face with different creams.  All you need to do is follow diet free of dairy, red meat or eggs, alcohol, has to have more fruits and vegetables and no fried food and no junk as well.No artificial sugar at all.   Try to get the internal system clear by eating at regular hours and sleeping well at night.  Hope this helps.|`|mE3midqkaa	Pro Active. All my siblings have used it. It works really well.

Good Luck.
UbNOv4a1aa	maybe you should stop purging... do you realize how bad eating disorders - of any sort - arefor your overall health? not good. purging alone can destroy your entire throat and rip enamel off the back of your teeth. it could be that your inner throat is bleeding or part of your stomach from regurgitating. NOT GOOD! starving yourself, for even one or two meals makes your body fast and lose nutrition. if you do that then the body stored what nutrientss it can get, meaning it is storing the fat cells. if you starve yourself in short and go through a process of starving, eating, purging your body will be unstable and more or less gain weight for awhile. eating disorders also tear up you intestinal track and your whole digestional system since you either have little food or none, let alone tossing everything back up. you need to eat. you need to be healthy and YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR! please, i am not trying to insinuate that u are stupid or anything like that but i just think that you need to respect yourself enough to be healthy! take care of yourself, you know? dont think you arent worth much. you are! YOUR LIFE COUNTS!! it really does. and god wants you to have the best life you can! and even if you do not believe in god ... or any of that... there are people that care for you. there is someone who loves you and cares and i am sure they dont want you to be like this either.     please, try to take care of yorslef and realize your own worth.

B1NfhVQsaa	I don't think there is anything called "obsessive flirting disorder" but you do have a problem that you need to address !    And the sooner the better to make yourself better.... You can be hurt by your actions both mentally and physically without meaning to.  It is an obsession with needing/getting the wrong type of attention from guys and that IS a compulsive disorder.      You need to try to figure out why you feel the need for the attention.  Have you recently gone thru a bad time?  Parents divorce?  Death of close friend?  Breakup from bf?   Can you talk to your parents?  or how about getting someone else to talk to? (counselor or professional that will keep it confidential - no friends cause they wont keep it secret) If not, try keeping a journal and writing down everything that happens.....it will give you a chance to go back and see what you're doing right and wrong.  And give you strength to avoid falling into the traps these guys are setting.  You may not see it now, but you will.  Why are they being so flirty?  Something is wrong...not with you....but them...especially if any of them have girlfriends, which they usually do!    First, stop encouraging these guys by flirting/texting them on the internet.  These older guys aren't really your friend even though they may act like it.   And don't start any new flirty relationships.  You need to say hi and then keep it light and get off.  Go do something else that gives you the same satisfaction or good feeling they give you.  Read, play games, see a movie....But do something that is NOT going to hurt you in the long run.  Give your flirty attention to your bf ,if you have one.  He'll love the attention!!!!!    Do this for yourself.  You are vulnerable now for some reason and they will continue to take advantage/flirt and maybe even harm you if you're not careful.  You have recognized that you need to do something and that's a good first start.   It will be hard at first, but don't carry onlong conversations with these creeps....especially if they start with the sexual flirting.....and they will if they havent' already.    And the older guys will "talk" about you and you don't need a bad reputation because of this.  Excessive flirting just gives them the wrong idea about you and they may end up hurting you physically and emotionally.  The seniors will be moving on soon and arent worth your time!    You can do this.  Start now so you can feel good again.  Stay strong and don't give in to them.  Challenge yourself to do this.  Keep a log/diary and see how you're doing or find someone to talk to that can help you, not hurt you.  Don't think these guys will help you either , so don't trust them.  You seem to really want to help yourself, so I think you can do it.  Good luck!|`|cgU9JHoRaa	hey the best thing you can do is pick the ones you like the best narrowow it down to only a few then ask them out one might say yes they others might say no but if they say no don't get disscoraged you could always find some one else and flirting is natural fo a teen... hope this helps!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	There is no such thing as a "Flirting Disorder", you are just horny and want to get laid.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Some people, like myself, find it hard not to flirt. It is part of your personality and nature. The only problem is that you don't want to lead on the people that you aren't interested in. Even though you say you like the seniors the most, (which is because they are usually more mature than the guys around your age) the reality is that they are going to go on and go to college, meet college girls, and wont want anything to do with a junior in high school. So you may not want to pursue a relationship from those guys. As for flirting, its harmless as long as your not in a committed relationship, and that you are interested in the guy that you are flirting with.|`|qpv8H3suaa	I HAVE THIS TOO!!!!! I need some help with this same thing!!! You aren't alone. I have a boyfriend who I really really do liek I just have a problem in that I can't help but flirt with other guys. Sometimes it's to make him jealous, sometimes I think it's just because I'm insecure about him owning me. I don't know.|`|LWanA5ueaa	Think about the reasons why you flirt. Are you insecure? Do you like the attention? I'm guessing you like the attention but after the fact you feel bad. That would make it negative attention since you feel bad. Try to be conscious of what you're doing. Get attention somewhere else, like friends or family.    Good luck.|`|xDINUPBuaa	This could probably stem from some sort of abuse when you were younger.  Possibly also from being brought up in a bad situation such as divorced parents, one an alcoholic, or drug abuse, maybe molestation by a relative or family friend.      If you have had some sort of traumatic experience when you were much younger that you could remember, I would suggest seeing the counselor about getting treatment from a psychologist or something.  This could develop into something worse when you grow up.  You could someday flirt with the wrong guy would might hurt you or even rape you.  And it's not out of the question that you could lose your life in that sort of a situation.  It's actually quite dangerous.

Since everything you have tried has not worked so far, then you may want to ask your doctor to give you a vaginal exam. Good Luck!|`|qw5bNAlRaa	I don't know whether Yaz is a combination pill (estrogen and progesterone) or if it is a mini-pill (progesterone only).  Progesterone only pills are extremely sensitive and if yo are even an hour or two late taking your pill every day, you will start your period.  Combination pills seem to make your cycle much more regular.  I started my period on the exact same day of my placebo pill week every single time.
bwJSJ49Oaa	Do you have anyone else who you can talk to face to face about it? Especially someone you look up to like an older relative or something? Honestly, if you try to find someone you trust like that who you can bare your soul to and get it all off your chest, it will help so much.  Even if there's nothing they can do, the fact that you've said the words out loud to someone else will help.  Hopefully they can then give you a lot of encouragement and let you know that they'll be there for you and make you feel supported.  It's just as important for you to be supported in all of this.  You're not a robot.  Don't feel bad about finding it difficult, it just means you're a normal human being.  Whenever it gets too much, try doing something to get away from it all, something physical like going for a walk on your own somewhere nice, or going to the gym, or playing a musical instrument, or even just writing it all down in a diary or on paper that you can then throw away.  Just anything you can think of to stop all the thoughts circulating in your mind, which will give you a bit of release from it all at least...Really good luck, I honestly hope you'll be OK.|`|chOS6EO0aa	I am sorry to hear about your families condition. You have done an excellent thing by trying to help yourself too. It seems a bit overwhelming right now, but take a deep breath and look on the reality of things one by one. Don't think about trying to solve everyything, because it is not up to fix everyone ( trust me I had to learn that the hard way,by forgetting my 4th anniversary due to stress). Take a logical look on what you can do and to those things only, do not try to overextend yourself.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	First, breathe.  Now, if you're this kind of person, pray.  Then, make yourself an appointment with a therapist.  You have a lot going on that you need to deal with.  There's nothing wrong with getting that help.  Other things I know your therapist will tell you.  You need to set some boundaries.  I know you need to be there for your family, but first and foremost you must take care of you or else you'll be no good to them at all.  Plus, you need to set aside time for yourself, and to spend time with others.  It is important that you maintain a life outside of the bad stuff that is going on right now.
AA11785060	Most guys usually masturbate really quickly, and I mean like 2 or 3 minutes.  Sex on average lasts about 3 to 4 minutes from insertion to ejaculation.

1f644ebbaa	No you shouldn't shave your body hair to please a woman. Unless of course its the one you love, maybe. Just keep cleaned, well groomed, perhaps trimmed down there, and that will be just fine. If you don't want to then you don't have too.

In this case you will have a few options. You can shave off all the pubic hair. If this sounds too critical you can only trim some of the pubic hair. Cut the entire bush shorter. Or you can cut it shorter and shave some hair around the base of the penis away. Another option is to shave some hair at the base of the penis and the scrotum. The options are endless. Just use your wildest imagination. With shaving and trimming you can have a different pubic hair style each month. This will make it less boring.   Shaved hair is also good for better hygiene down south. It also make oral sex more pleasant should you practice it.|`|wBwHhygWaa	hey!  I shave my body because I can and because its clean.

Why not help him and talk to him about all the money that is wasted and perhaps spend it on a sport he likes? It doesn't have to be a hard sport. Maybe snowboarding, tennis, or golfing?

3pfhWdRKaa	Working out late at night is probably not the best thing you can do for your body. At night your body is expecting sleep, instead you are making it work hard after a full day of work. To grow muscles your body needs time to repair the damage that working out has done (torn muscle fiber). This is usually done at night while you are sleeping.    If you are tying to loose weight and gain muscle then this diet is not for you. It does not have enough of the nutrient your body needs. To accomplish your goals try a diet low in fat, medium in carbs, and high in protein. An egg white omelet for breakfast, grilled chicken salad for lunch, a meat and some veggies for dinner. Try to stay away from processed foods and from eating between meals or late at night.
rnQjDbAdaa	Most likely, this extra peice of skin is your hymen and this is normal.  Try using a lower absorbancy tampon or just inserting it gently.  It's normal for your hymen to tear when using tampons and you may see a little bit of blood and feel a slight pain, this is normal too.  If you are having major problems with this skin though or if you don't think it's your hymen you should speak to a gyno who can help you out more.  In the meantime here's a link for you:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen    Hope I helped!|`|UspK4SQBaa	It is probably your hymen.  You can try to use thinner tampons or just gently insert it.  If it's thin, it will probably tear enough to get it in.  If it isn't, speak to a gynecologist.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	ruits and veggies    I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water. I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........|`|AA11074620	I would drastically increase your fruits, vegetables, nuts/berries, and water/tea intake. Drastically reduce your meat, bread, table salt, concentrated sugars (any sugar not already present in your food naturally, and dairy intake. This is a big change for most, but it eliminates the factors that lead to having a little more tummy in the first place.     Water is your perhaps one of the best components in this way of eating. Good luck!    John
i0nlqfJVaa	If you're sure that it is not a period thing, then I wonder if it is a bowel thing. Sometimes the pain from your bowel can feel like period pain. How long have you had the pain for and have you been to the bathroom lately? Is it on one side more than the other? It might be your appendix. Could you be pregnant? Something could be going wrong. I'm not a doctor so it really is hard to say. I think that if it continues for too much longer then you should go to the doctors. Just in case. Good luck!

RZulpgXyaa	Vitamin e oil- you can buy this at most CVS, WalMart, drugstores.  You can buy the PURE oil in a bottle or if you can't find that, you can buy the gel capsules.  Just prick a hole in the capsule with a needle or safety pin and squeeze the oil out.      Vitamin e oil works wonders to heal skin and it won't clog your pores.  Pure vitamin e oil is best- with no mineral oil.  I use it on spots that i've picked at too much and where skin is peeling and dry.  It speeds up the healing process a lot.  Good luck!|`|5EfJu34taa	you can try fresh lemon drops(but only 2-3) on the pimple area.allow it to cool by itself.usually it works within a week.good luck    regarding stopping your habit of pimple-picking all i can say is that look at your face & see the pimple marks caused because of your habit.it will be best.it helped me...

Take Midol, and Aleve.  It just about eliminates my cramps, and the headache.    And exercise.  Go to the gym and work out. Do sit-ups and stuff.    It really helps to sweat.    Works for me.  Hope you feel better. :]|`|550eVd5Baa	Well, you can take pills. You're getting pain because there are huge blood clots.. You can do stuff to help you.. Maybe call a friend?|`|VYu4W7k0aa	Oh, hell.  I know exactly how you feel.  I cried during a game of Battleship once (and it was a language review game...xD)  I try to keep a low profile, get extra sleep, and avoid things I know make me sad (movies, books, photos, etc.) And it's okay to tell your friends how you're feeling, too.  (Well, maybe not guy friends, but...)|`|K9Nqkfh4aa	it's hard especially on weekends, but if you can get up outta bed without wasting time hanging out around the house, and go work out, take a dance class or even window shop a little, it always makes me feel more calm. if you don't feel like going out after that, call a friend and have them come over for dinner or a movie. that way you won't have the downtime to get all weepy!
mjshqfuyaa	Ohh yes without a doubt...  but not until you have children some women's breast size increases by 2 cup sizes right after they have children.   you will just have to wait a while :]|`|uGIIR9Beaa	It's well possible you'd grow D's. Pregnancy can also do so. A friend of mine has had larger breasts ever since she gave birth. Girls usually grow until 16, with exception until 18. In past times it was said that was until age 14, but that number has since been adjusted to my knowledge. The rate at which your breasts will keep growing may differ greatly however. Therefor you may stick with a C, or even grow a small or large D.    If your breast size is of extreme bother to you, then you could visit your GP for further suggestions.|`|sndBzQzAaa	If you're 14 and already a C it's very likely you're still growing and may even surpass a D.|`|rnQjDbAdaa	Most likely no because you are pretty much done growing.  But you never know, some girls continue to grow until they are 18.  Gaining weight will make your breasts larger.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	34D would be awesome|`|AA11987492	I was a 34B, then I started breastfeeding, now I am a 34DD.

If you're 14 & you're already that size (I'm 17 & I'm a 36C) then you'll probably reach a D. Your body is not yet fully developed. Well, you can never know for sure... but I think you will.|`|tO7e262zaa	Sounds like you will. Wait till you have kids when you get older. You'd wish for your 34C back lol

Can you say jiggly gut? I wish it would go straight to my hips, thighs, and butt.|`|pkvKK6qVaa	reduce the amount of fat you consume, increase exercise...|`|dca2c702f1f138a553055a97f5b22bd4aa	Unfortunately there are no exercises to reduce fat in just one part of your body. A good exercise program, which can be as easy as a half hour walk per day, and controlling food portions will make that jiggly a*s look fine indeed! Of course, you can do spot exercises to tone up those areas, see http://www.womens-health-fitness.com/but... for a good set. Good luck!|`|ZK6Ozjb4aa	Genetics plays a big role here. You cannot pick the spot you want to reduce. You can, although, spot tone with resistance training. Fat sits on top of muscle so that's gotta be lessened first with calorie restriction and working the muscles (which boosts the metabolism and helps preserve lean mass). When you lose weight, you lose a percentage of lean mass (lowers metabolism) and a percentage of fat. If you work your muscles with resistance training, you will lose fat and perserve your lean mass.Normally, with weight, last on is first off. In what pattern did you gain the weight? That will, generally, reflect how the weight comes off. Cardio vascular workouts and weight training and a healthy low calorie diet is how to do it.There's really no "secret". But you do need to find what works for you. You won't stick to a program that you hate!|`|6sPcYQr0aa	As far as concentrating on that specific area. You want to make sure you are working those muscles for endurance, not strength. Running, speed walking, jogging, swimming with fins, great for trimming thighs and buttocks. If you do enjoy running, try to make it so you dont enjoy it. Also make your route up and down hills. Helps with your stride strength. On the other side of it is diet.  It doesnt really matter what you eat and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.

tO7e262zaa	It all depends on your body. If they are irregular now, there is no way to predict. If they continue to be irregular, your doctor may recommend getting on birth control just to give you regular periods. You don't have to be sexually active for that.
NYQhhNbzaa	Curves in Australia is around $50 per month.  From memory quite a few of their machines were to work the legs.  You could visit and talk to them about it, but remember they want you business and might try to talk you into signing up on the spot.  Also check out other local gyms, and make comparisons, see which one you feel more comfortable with.    Swimming is a good all round exercise as it places the least stress/strain on the body.    Warning: Don't have them direct debit your bank account for the monthly fees,  if they insist and you do, what they don't tell you is that once the initial 12 month membership is up the money does not automatically stop.

You're right. It's rectum.|`|3pfhWdRKaa	I have never heard of a recrum, but what your sister had was probably a rectal prolapse.

Her condition is called a prolapsed rectum and it must have taken some 'superhuman' pushing strength on her part.
RczxgiQaaa	With that little of detail, it's hard to say what's going on... but you're not gonna get a six pack by walking.  Here's a diet & exercise program built for six pack abs... http://www.cuttingfat.info
PZm218jcaa	No, heels all day will definitely mess up your feet and the way you walk. To tone your legs easily, just do toe raises a few mintues daily. Stand on your tiptoes and then go down and keep doing that.|`|sJqFcCRPaa	yeah walking in heels is exercise, you lazy broad........get on a treadmill and do some leglifts, get real!!|`|wNSI1wdCaa	No. Heels are bad and they tend to make you walk slower so I don't think you'll burn much fat.
xiPr5hUYaa	They do work... I have use them many times... check out http://how-to-pass-drug-tests.com/ to find out more info about detox drinks. everything you could passably want to know about how they work, why corporations test for drugs, and how effective they are|`|k5zvA1X9aa	Stay away from Vale products. They don't work at all. Check www.erowid.org for good advice on the subject.|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	They only work if it's a urine test.     Anyway, all they do is make you drink a bunch of water right before the test to make the sample dilute. The b-vitamins in them make your pee yellow instead of clear and the creatine in them makes your sample test as being non-diluted.    Drinking a 32 ounces of water and taking a b complex vitamin and a creatine supplement a few hours before will have the exact same results but be way less expensive.
le9ZROs5aa	Ummm when you have SRS (sex reassignment surgery) they get rid of the testicles so I don't know if the story is completely viable. Possibly prostate cancer as that is the only male sexual organ that remains intact after SRS. They leave the prostate so you can still have sexual stimulation during intercourse.|`|DozD8lTGaa	wow - i never knew that!!    atleast it's a way to find out quickly - so they don't have to go the long way around it and give tests and that (and waste time)... just give them the test and get the results that day!! hmm, good. X|`|zX00ZHtQaa	wow thanks for the info.|`|wBwHhygWaa	(: want to find out?|`|K4zsztkRaa	Yes it can, but you would have to have a SERIOUS case of testicular cancer. So it has to be in the final stage.

OLl4HEAzaa	for your acne use proactive, that stuff really works. and for your diet it seams like a very reasonable goal,  search around on the internet for a plkan that you think will fit your li9fe style.
n7KCez59aa	Hi !    3 1/2 months is great to loose 18-30lbs.    I suggest eating high fiber foods, fruits, vegetables, drink plenty of water, baked / grilled chicken and/or fish and unsalted nuts.   The best form of easy exercise would be jogging, if you want to work out, which I suggest for optimal weight loss.     Oil Free Acne Wash with MIcroClear technology by Neutrogena will help rid you, and prevent, acne.     Baby oil or Coco Butter lotion is great for reducing the visibility of your stretch marks. Makes sure, whichever you use, to put in on after you take a shower / bath.

Good luck|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	Well. I'm 52 and never had acne in my teens. But over the years my skin has become more oily and I have it now. So. who knows.|`|ChSrd2ftaa	Well, yes. They say that acne is a young age thing and gets better as we get older. However, adult acne is on of the contrast points to this statement. If you are above 25 and still get plenty of pimples, consult a dermatologist. He/She might advise to take Accutane medication.   You can find lots of information about this medication on google and yahoo answers as well.
nRFZwdN4aa	Question makes me dizzy:0) Ok, here is an attempt to answer.     Phrased in layman's terms, could a chemical abnormality in the brain be caused by excessively thinking about it?     Perhaps indirectly, if you haven't developed a coping strategy (i.e. not fixating on it so much).     Stressful life events can cause an elevation in cortisol levels in the brain, which kills certain cells in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for emotional memory and learning.     So, via a circuitous route, stressing out a lot over something can elevate a stress chemical in the brain, which may exacerbate the original problem.|`|WXExyAlWaa	Absolutely yes. The brain is so complicated anyway! No one really understands how it works, and even a lot of mental disorders we don't know their causes properly.|`|d6M0jmIkaa	In a way it can.  If you were to fixate on a mental disorder, and believe you had it, you brain would help you out by giving you the symptoms you think you have.  But your brain won't chemically change just because you think it will, if that were true you could cure a mental illness by acting normal, right?  Which i've tried myself to no avail.  But your mind can give you a pretty convincing show, which on the outside would look just like the said illness.|`|ehea7Tboaa	For sure! Why do you think placebos work with people? I believe you can manifest numerous abnormalities be it physical or mental. In a lot of cases thinking is some peoples worst enemy.

nJQD0vqEaa	Our RN student and pharmacy tech has a lot to learn about steroid esters me thinks.    One can generally say that test is test, but there appear to be differences in take up by the human body and of course there is the issue of detection times if you are competing.    Test Prop is the shortest ester having a half life of just 1.5 days (ish). This makes it great for coming up to competition time as the detection times are vastly reduced. It's also handy to stack with other short ester steroids such as Masteron or Trenbolone Acetate because they all hit your body fast.    The down side is that they should be administered every day (some say every other day but it's down to what works for you), Best blood levels with propionate are to be had with ED injections.    Many people report appetite reduction on such short ester steroids and as such they are often used in cutting cycles.    Personally, I don't mind pinning myself every day and can use short esters for bulking sessions too as I suffer no appetite loss (especially if I add some injectable B12 along side).    Testoviron (Test enanthate) has a much longer half life and as such takes a longer time to build up to useful levels in the body. As such it is suited better for longer (10+ week cycles) as you won't hit peak blood levels for at least three weeks after your first injection.    This can of course be combated to a degree by 'pre-loading' i.e. taking a much higher dose on your first shot. Testoviron can be shot every 4-5 days so if you aren't happy about pinning then this may be a good choice. Detection time because of the half life is much longer though.    Test Cyp only has a half day shorter half life then Enanthate, but as you state, should be shot E3D for optimum blood levels. Again a pre-load can be useful as it takes 2-3 weeks to kick in.    Many people using long ester cycles will use d-bol for the first few weeks while the test kicks in.    I've had great results using Test Enanthate E4D @500mg shots (yes a gram every second shot) for 14 week cycles, and adding in shorter ester compounds such as Tren A (100mg ED) for 4 weeks during the cycle for massive strength gains.    For extra size I would recommend Nandrolone Decanoate (deca) at 400mg/week - more does not seem to have any additional effect, but given the long half life on this compound it should be run for at least 6 to 8 weeks minimum and stopped 2 weeks before you stop your Test shots in preparation for PCT.    [edit] And the oil has naff all to do with it. It's just a carrier. The test powders are manufactured to have specific half lives. They are then dissolved in Benzyl Alcohol and/or benzyl benzoate to liquify them. The carrier oil can be anything - Grapeseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, hemp seed oil - it doesn't matter. The final product is then filtered (to at least .24um) to clean and sterilise it before injection. As long as it is smooth enough to run through the pin easily then all is good.|`|	The least expensive.  The propionate and cypionate are just the salt that they connect the testosterone to so your body will take the compound into the cells.  Without the carrier, the salt, the testosterone would not be an active compound within your body.  There is no difference in efficacy.  When the brand name drugs were released they claimed they were different so one company could release the compound under one brand name and the other under their own brand name without committing a patent violation.  The depot usually will last longer than the other two because there is a special oil that the testosterone is suspended in- usually 3 months or so, so go by cost.  If you can figure out the cost per dose and how often the dosing is needed you can come up with a definitive answer as to which one is better.  Chemically they will all do the same things.  Conveniently you may want to only have to inject once every 1 to 3 months whereas the latter two are usually once every 1 - 2 weeks.  Then again if you are using testosterone for bodybuilding and not hormone replacement therapy things could be different.  The desired effect should be replacing lost or reduced testosterone and that is why I say it doesn't matter which "salt" you would use since each of them have been clinically proven to carry the testosterone into your cells.  It can cause breast cancer and breast growth (which is common) in males as well as prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.  Maybe a built body is more important that small testicles that can develop cancer due to increased testosterone levels in someone who already has normal testosterone levels.  It also can cause osteolysis (your bones will break) and an increase in calcium in your blood because it will no longer be in your bones.  So you lose some teeth maybe that is okay as long as you look like you are buff.  Oh an speaking of cancer you could get liver cancer and cholestatic jaundice, who needs a liver anyway right as long as you are buff?  Normal testosterone levels in young men is 300-1050ng/dL if you have normal levels and you add more testosterone you will surpress luteinizing hormone which comes from your pituitary gland, luteinizing hormone causes your gonads to release testosterone that it makes.  When you stop this negative feedback loop that normally occurs to promote homeostasis you can set yourself up for trouble because once you stop using testosterone your body will have to resume doing so itself and you can have rebound hypogonadism.  You also will not produce sperm because you are inhibiting follicle stimulating hormone.  The endocrine system is very delicate and unless you have a doctor who is monitoring proper dosing levels that determines what amount you truly need, you can jack yourself up royally.  You need to have routine bloodwork done to make sure no liver damage is developing as well as a lipid panel (cholesterol levels).  You also need to have a prostate specific antigen test done to check for prostate cancer periodically.  You have to monitor your frequency or change in urination as it can cause you to have dysuria.  Also watch for increased snoring or change in ability to breathe since testosterone use can cause sleep apnea.  If you miss a dose of the injection you have to see the doctor right away because the dose will need to be adjusted.  It is such a fine tuned system that is dangerous to haphazardly decide one day you are going to use it to gain muscle mass.  If you are using it to supplement testosterone because your levels are low then it does not matter which salt you use because they all will replace testosterone. I would just go with whichever one is the most cost effective and convenient. If you are trying to "cheat" and gain muscle mass because you want to become a body builder or some muscle head then I would ask you to reconsider because one day you will either end up with some form of horrid cancer, tiny testicles, infertile, breasts, and not to mention the fact once you stop using it you will become fat because you will never lose the mass once you've built it; you will just lose the tone and definition and it will become blubber.  All those "roid" head guys who are now in their 50s look ridiculous because their heads are fat, they look like they have Cushing syndrome, and they could've prevented it by just building muscle the healthy way without trying to cheat.  Testosterone doesn't make you strong it just makes you big.   I've seen men who legitimately use testosterone for replacement and funny thing is they don't end up looking like they are a beached whale, probably because their levels were properly monitored, but the former "roid" heads, right now we have two, look terrible and highly unattractive.  I'd also like to add the black box warning associated with nandrolone deconoate:   Peliosis hepatis, a condition in which liver and sometimes splenic tissue is replaced with blood-filled cysts, and liver cell tumors have been reported in patients receiving androgenic anabolic steroid therapy.  These conditions can lead to life threatening liver failure, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, or death.  May also cause marked changes that are known to be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis (hardining of the ateries) and coronary artery disease.    Also nandrolone decanoate is a synthetic derivative of testeroterone and it has both anabolic and androgenic effects.  It will increase hemoglobin and red cell mass so they give it to patients who are anemic and have renal insufficiency.  Nandrolone also can cause atrophy of the testis as well as testicular hypofunction while increasing the amount of erections you have.  You'll become erect but you might not be able to ejaculate that doesn't sound like fun to me.  Oh and don't forget priapism, the involuntary, prolonged (greater than 4 hours) erection of the penis unrelated to sexual arousal and unrelieved by ejaculation.   If you have priapism you have to

Of course some people like to shave theirs for oral purposes, no one likes to floss while giving a bj I'm sure.

K8LHoYruaa	Based on personal experience... Worst reason is... "I'm being made to do this by my girlfriend, but I plan to lie to the therapist and beat her up anyway".    it's very easy to think your problems aren't important, but that's how most of us feel. I have a relatively serious medical condition that went untreated for many years as I just didn't want to make a fuss.     It's always difficult to do something that focuses on you.

But to be honest that's more or less general knowledge. Anyone can be helpful whether they have had one before or not (besides my dad, lol.). I know no more that I did before I started mine, and having mine doesn't affect the way I help other people.    You will start anytime. Generally girls start before they turn 16 but some people don't start until 17 or even 18.
AA11605300	No. I used to do this, as a kid, all the time. Blankets are usually porous enough to let some air pass through. Still, humans have a built in reflex to come up for air if you're sleeping under a blanket too long.|`|6xHOa3tJaa	I sleep with the blanket over my head and there is  no problem with it so keep doing it|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Not smart; you'll tend to inhale your own CO2 breath.  Which means you'll be deprived of oxygen.  That probably explains the brain damage.|`|EjdOItfEaa	I sleep with my blanket over my head on cold night's I dont see why it would be bad unless someone farted in it.. =0P|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I don't think so.

I did it and still do it @s a child and nothing happened. But there are possibilities of suffocating so maybe just be aware of it.

5l2kTANaaa	Please bear in mind that only North Americans and people of various religious ( muslims, jews) advocate circumcision. The rest of the world does not care.  Pro : girls on here (majority are American) seem to think that anything "natural" which has not been altered in any way find that what you were born  with "gross".  Cons : loss of sensitivity. The skin of the glans gets hardened hence...(been told by someone who experienced the before and after) you will need more stimulation.    You were born with a foreskin...why take it off ? (but that is my personal opinion)    As long as you keep it clean.....and do not let any smigma build..    Nothing repulsive about an uncircumcised penis.|`|gRfqjemmaa	Circumcised are cleaner, less sensitivity maybe, otherwise there is really no difference.  If you are not circumcised, keep it clean. Pull back the skin and wash daily.|`|zX00ZHtQaa	cut-clean uncut-ewwwww|`|QBUypAmAaa	Since you want simple...  Circumcised = everything is out in the open so it's much less sensitive than being intact as they have something covering the glans at all times keeping it moist and highly sensual. It is seemingly easier to clean, but circumcised guys clean less often than intact guys which means they're probably dirtier, just because you can't see smegma residue doesn't mean it's clean.    Intact = your glans is covered 24/7 almost and is super sensitive and moist, meaning much more pleasurable, the foreskin also protects against dirt and other outside materials foreign to your body. The gliding action of the foreskin assists in easier masturbation and sex, as also it creates wonderful pleasuring sensations for the penis. Intact has to be cleaned daily, but it takes less than a minute, and is not more prone to getting infections despite what a lot of misinformed people say. Also 80% of the world's men are intact.    That's as short and simple as I could make it.    Edit: If you're asking because you're wondering about getting your son done at birth. Then intact is easier to clean, because it is sealed off and all dirt which may accumulate will only be on the outside of the penis where you can see it. So best way to clean it is leave it alone and may be a rub down occasionally. Never retract a baby's foreskin either, because it's attached to the glans and eventually separates on it's own, doing so is equivalent to ripping up your fingernails to clean under them. Phimosis is sort of uncommon so you don't need to worry about that. Mainly, leave him intact and let him decide when he gets older, it's a lie when people say it's better to circumcise at birth, because doing so can actually stunt the growth of the the penis during puberty and cause problems. Circumcising when an adult at least the penis is full grown and won't suffer much damage or become possibly deformed or stunted in growth as a baby's would.|`|8ytLLHV4aa	cut pros: easier to clean, impossible to get phimosis  might be pros: supposidly less chance to catch some illness if you are cut.    other than that...there is no different between being cut or uncut.    don't listen to someone who tells you being cut makes your sex feel less.  all studies have shown there is no loss in sexual satisfaction while cut.|`|K4zsztkRaa	You are the only person that can decide the pro's and con's for yourself. One man's Pro may be another man's Con.    Pro's to uncircumcised, you have more fun durring sex, there's more you can do with a foreskin, also you enjoy sex more because there is more feeling, you have longer lasting orgasms, and the orgasms are more intense.    Con's I can't really think of any, maybe it might be more of a hassle to wash to some people. Me it's no big deal it takes 20 seconds.    Circumcision Pro's, absolutly nothing.    Con's, the skin is too tight, sex doesn't feel nearly as good, oragsms are dull, there isn'tmuch you can dowith it, you need lube (more money) condoms are harder to keep on circumcised guys (do statistics show), circumcised sex can actually hurt your partner, especially females, the rim of the head will withdraw lubrication from the vagina and cause the vagina to become dry and this can cause pain. You don't have any mobile skin which can cause painful intercourse for the guy.  Plus you have a nasty scar and you no longer have a whole penis, just a cut up one.    Those are my opinions on the pro's and cons.    -Connor|`|37yBB96Iaa	it,s cleaner bro...|`|lCvJHS13aa	I was circumcised at birth and always had a feeling something was missing.  I started the restoring process about 8 yrs ago, now I am fully covered and doctors can't tell the difference until they do a close exam.  I am SO glad i restored, no problem staying clean, wish I had never been cut.    There are also studies that sensitivity IS lost:  (1) "a 2002 review by Boyle et al. stated that "the genitally intact male has thousands of fine touch receptors and other highly erogenous nerve endingsmany of which are lost to circumcision, with an inevitable reduction in sexual sensation experienced by circumcised males." They concluded, "Evidence has also started to accumulate that male circumcision may result in lifelong physical, sexual, and sometimes psychological harm as well. Sorrells et al., using monofilament touch-test mapping, found that the foreskin contains the most sensitive parts of the penis, noting that these parts are lost to circumcision. They also found that "the glans of the circumcised penis is less sensitive to fine-touch than the glans of the uncircumcised penis."|`|TNNSHdypaa	Pros: cleaner, not as sensitive, and less prone to infections.    Cons: women tend to get more pleasure out of sex from uncut penises, it's a fact; also uncut is more natural, and most of the men in the world are uncut.
4wXmnBr9aa	The best way I've ever heard is to find the total for how much a cigarette pack costs, multiply that by however many they have a day, then eventually find out how much they cost for a year.  Then say  you could have gone on a trip to ____ or bought ___ or whatever they seem to like.  Another thing is to say that the average man lives to be (78) (not sure on the number, so check that out).  Then say, subtract fourteen years from that.  That's how much shorter your life will be because you chose to smoke.  Also, you can write a letter telling him how much he means to you and how you don't want to lose him to lung cancer, emphysema, COPD complications, etc.  Let him know that his smoking habits don't only harm him; they harm all those around him.  Let him know that you will be there every step of the way during the quitting process, if he chooses to take that path, and will be there to support him.  To start it off, you might want to attach a letter with the most important things you can think of as to why you want him to quit to a box of candy cigarettes.  That's what I did with my aunt, and she appreciated it.  These are just a few suggestions.  https://www.quitnow.net/quitplan/ is a good starting point.  You can get any other (helpful) information from there.|`|n1bLZJqAaa	Hehe i love the reasons you said, and they are so true..    I smoked for over 11 years, and I managed to quit....

chOS6EO0aa	If you are trying your best and are experiencing stress, then yes, speak to a counsellor. If you don't want the same goals as your parents then that makes it difficult to study. We all have experienced anxiety where we think others seem to be adapting easier, but I have come to learn that some people who say that, class is easy to get an A don't always get one. Be confident in your past successes that will inspire you to hold on to what you know, which is that YOU CAN DO WELL. But reducing work load will not make you a failure, it will make you a smart person.|`|zBGrswLNaa	Don't push so hard, its is easy to get overwhelmed while in school, but what you need is one weekend where you take some ME time and do what ever it is that is the most fun to you. Whether its checking out a movie or sitting around laughing with friends, take a break and a step back for a couple hours and unwind.|`|RJpekNPfaa	Yes, a visit to the university student counsellor may help. I was having a similar problem and the counsellor taught me some meditations, breathing and relaxing exercises. They also helped me to defer a subject and that really helped to lighten the load.    So are you able to drop or defer some subjects?    Also maybe its time to start pleasing yourself, rather than pleasing your parents. Its your life, not theirs.     I personally dont see dropping out of subjects or even dropping out of college to be a failure. I see it as a positive step to take control of your life.    Maybe the other students are coping better because they dont have such a high standard to live up to.    Take some time out and have some fun and you may feel more refreshed and motivated. Daily exercises will help to....yoga, walking in nature, swimming etc...    .
2gdS1ay8aa	The stone is a unit of weight. It is part of the Imperial system of weights and measures used in the UK, and formerly used in most Commonwealth countries.

uoW8kmgiaa	first of all... calm down. you are probably a combination of stressed, tired, and very emotional. whats going on depends on your age, as well. if you are currently menstrating, then your emotions really go crazy. but what your describing sounds like frequent to infrequent heart palpitations. i dont experience them, but i know people who do. it's not "normal", but its not a dier concern (dont rush to the ER). since this is your body, i dont know exactly how you're feeling, but can imagine well enough. i'd drink water, try to avoid "heavy" or "creamy" food for a few days, and make an appointment with a doctor if the pulls are persisting. don't let it go unnoticed, but certainly dont panic.     hope i've helped a bit...  i wish you the best, and really hope you feel better soon|`|ajUUYmWFaa	I think you should go to the doctor and get checked out  I hope you feel better soon!!!|`|4zoN1U3Waa	My friend exercises, takes walks, eats healthy, feels healthy.Last december he had a massive heart failure and was out for a while which shock alot of people.What I would like to tell  you is that, sometimes we may feel fine and do everything by the book but our bodies do not always obey.Get a physical at least ones a year to know how well or unwell you could be.

So if your angry your heart beats you sweta ext... if your happy you allways have a smile you ahve energy can jump up n down ext...     What ever happends affects all of you.  If you "Dont Cry" then you bottle your emotions up, thats 100% un-healthy.     It dont matter if your a man or women its good/healty to cry or scream as long as your dealin with your emotions inm a heathy way.    You need to get how you feel out in the open. ..write it down or scream at the top of your lungs into a pillow.     What ever you do every part of you affects another part, so to be heathy in one way you need to be heathy in all aspects...        I HOPE I HELPED      I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER    if this doent work then see a doctor|`|xVmbTsAbaa	Why don't you see a counsellor to see if there are any issues you need to deal with. Sometimes issues can surface, ones that are buried deep in the psyche.   When deep issues surface, we can have anxiety/panic attacks.  Then to cope, we distract ourselves with anything, so that we don't feel these feelings. Even if you think you are fine, I still think you should go for at least 2 sessions, to explore your feelings and emotions.  You do need to let out your feelings. Schedule some down time in your busy life, to be by yourself and cry. See your counsellor.|`|4m5cgyzxaa	seek medicle atension

eekwpTMRaa	you need fats to keep your skin healthy and elastic, you don't want leathery skin when your 20 right? stop stressing, its bad for you! you eat very healthy fats, it only really counts if your overweight or if your skinny and you eat the bad fats like trans or TOO MANY saturated. your doing great and your body will only hold onto it more if you restrict it from what it really needs. your exercise routine is great, im only worried about your joints-you should only run 4 miles every other day or 3 days a week. pilates all you want, its gentle on the joints. do like 20 minutes on the elliptical and walk for another 20. this will prevent your joints from caroding and your cartilages and ligaments from not working very well when your in your late 20's to early 30's. that's when you'll be worried about your weight. right now, your young and healthy  and doing a very wonderful job, dont stress-just worry about getting into a good college and eating healthy. fruits and veggie fats don't count-they are good sugars that give you a radiant glow and energy. your cookie i imagine has fiber, i have the granola bars and only eat about two a week, b/c even though they are good for you, they still have un needed sugars and you could get a delicious orange in replacement that is just as good. good luck!|`|C88VCkvnaa	Aw, don't worry!

I was told be a doctor to start naming everything (outloud or in your head) I see in the room when I start having a panic attack.

It is so much easier to run away but just try to think logically,  if you feel completely out of control just say you dont feel well and have to go home.  It's really not the end of the world if you have to do that - try to be more relaxed and decide to do just that if the worst comes to the worst.  In other words have a back up plan to give you some peace of mind and stick to it.  I have found over the years that to know what you intend to do in certain circumstances is a panic and worry reliever.  I hope you find some comfort in this answer - honestly Blondie I wish you would stop worrying so much but I really do know how hard it can be to be realistic in these circumstances. God only knows how I managed to get the last job I had, I was in a terrible state when I went for the interview but it turned out to be the best job I ever had because I just gave it a try.....    God bless you    Take care
clSvfDmVaa	Are you talking about working out because this is the diet and fitness board.  There are all sorts of sports teams and clinics that meet over the summers.  Not to mention swimming, bicycling, and other outdoor activities.|`|l4Cwkx5eaa	Check with your city or county...many have summer jobs available for young teens...in particular with Parks and Recreation.  Check with the golf courses, greenhouses, lawn services, anything seasonal.  You are somewhat limited by your age due to various "laws" but keep looking and asking.  Good Luck!|`|AA11739944	I think this is in the wrong section?

All because i didn't rest before hand.|`|tg8Q25IHaa	I would say yes it's normal that you experience changes in your sleep and eating habits because you just did that shift once and it's gonna mess up your habits..

0HtTJAQoaa	Well, I've been taking Celexa for a year now, and it really is working well...I've tried many other anti-depressants before (including: Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, & Luvox) and Celexa is proven to be the best...Celexa (aka Citaprolam) is a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The best thing about this SSRI, is that it has the least potential for side effects...Unlike the other anti-depressants...  Celexa has a calming side effect...I suffer with anxiety & depression, and within the 1st week--I've noticed I was a bit calmer & my mood was lifted...The full effects can take up to 3-4 weeks...Patience is truly a virtue when it comes to these meds...cuz they're not like tranquilizers that take effect quickly...Tranquilizers (aka Benzodiazepines) are HIGHLY addictive...Be leary of the "quick fixes"...cuz they usually do damage in the end to your psyche! I know, cuz I've been there--done that!! I had to be detoxed off of Klonopin years ago...and it was sheer HELL...  Another good anti-depressant I've tried before was Effexor...However, I experienced racing thoughts & mania on it...I called my psychiatrist and she pulled me off of it immediately...  For anxiety, another non-addictive medicine is:  Buspar. This drug also takes some time to work.     Here's a good informative link that may be of interest to you: http://depression.about.com/od/gad/f/gad...  *And here's a Great site that has various support groups that you may wanna check out:  http://dailystrength.org/|`|NF80kaBDaa	The safest and the most commonly used antidepressant these days are the "SSRI" selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (prozac,Zoloft,Citalopram...etc) but the main problem with these drugs are the sexual dysfunctions|`|WXExyAlWaa	There is no single best antidepressant. They effect everyone slightly differently - I've been on three or four different medications trying to find the right one for me.

I'm thinking about getting back on it (im 17 now) if i only had stupid health insurance...|`|RJpekNPfaa	Sorry I cant suggest any medication because I no longer take medication.    On an alternative theme:    I have found the Raw Vegan diet the best thing for naturally managing depression and anxiety.    My depression and anxiety have completely vanished since I started to eat Raw Vegan foods.    I would also favour other natural methods like daily meditation, deep breathing, yoga, bach flower remedies, acupuncture, light therapy, exercise etc....    I had very bad depression and anxiety for years but I gave up all medication because as you say, the side effects made me feel worse.    Here are a few websites that talk about over-coming depression through diet and natural methods:    http://www.superbeingdiet.com/    http://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/ra...    http://www.rawveganradio.com/wordpress/a...    http://www.medicinescomplete.com/journal...    Good luck    EDIT: I find it quite shocking that I have so many thumbs down for this. I have cured my life-long depression and anxiety through simply changing my diet. I was often depressed to the point of suicide and the cocktail of tablets the doctor gave me often made me worse with their horrible side-effects.     I also find it quite shocking that there are young people on here quite happy to pop a Prozac without batting an eyelid or thinking of the longer term health consequences. I find it very sad that people dont want to make an effort to heal themselves; they just want a quick fix from the doctor.     For Gods sake people, wake up to yourselves and educate yourselves before its too late. Taking these drugs can lead to health issues that are much much worse than depression. Believe me, I know, been there, done that. And only just recovered from it.    If you really MUST take toxic chemical drugs, then Zoloft is meant to be quite good - or at least it seems to be the best of a bad bunch.     My doctor told me was non-addictive and that was a lie. I also saw a friend trying to reduce her dosage and come off it, and she was in a terrible mess. This drug also gave her a sexual dysfunction (i.e.) she was unable to have an orgasm and made her disinterested in sex or even cuddling. Nearly wrecked her marriage in the long run.    .|`|LNQx4gKgaa	Ask them to change to another one. Finding the right antidepressant can be challenging. Sometimes you have to try a few before you find the one that works for you. You really should not be asking other people what they think is best since they are not medical professionals. Remember, what may work for someone may not work for another.|`|zz1pLZAaaa	Xanex.|`|468vLURhaa	im depreseed to. i use Prozac it helps alot and theres no side effects.
4Hw1UWw8aa	Hello,    Maybe I could add something to that.    There are 3 main types of skin cancer,    (1) Squamous cell cancer,  (2) Rodent ulcer, also called Basal cell cancer, and  (3) Malignant melanoma.    What makes cancers life-threatening, in the main, is not where they are when they first start, - but where they spread to.  Bits of the original cancer "break off," in time, and get carried around to other parts of the body, where they settle and grow.  Like unwelcome visitors. These fragments are called "secondary deposits," or in medical jargon "metastases," (pronounced met- AS''-ta-seez.)    When the secondary deposits are plentiful and in critical organs like the brain, lungs, or liver, - they cause whole-body failure and death.    Skin cancers are certainly "locally erosive," - that is to say, they get larger and larger and eat away at (erode) the normal tissue, - but it's the secondaries that are so dangerous.    A "rodent ulcer" does not send out secondaries, but it is still called a cancer because it eats away deeply through everything underneath, in time... like a rat (rodent), hence the name.    A squamous cell cancer comes from flat skin cells originally, ("squamous" means "flat and stratified").  It is ready to send out secondaries, usually via the lymph nodes rather than through the blood-stream.  These lymph nodes then swell up.    Malignant melanoma is a heavy secondary-deposit spreader, and these secondaries are uniquely resistant to treatment.  Spread tends to be via the blood-stream as well as the lymph system.    There is certainly a direct relationship between how big the melanoma, or squamous cell cancer, has progressed locally, - and how likely there are to be secondaries, both now and in the future.  Both cancer types are usually removed locally with a block of surrounding skin, and then the Laboratory man with a microscope, measures exactly how deeply (in millimeters,) the cancer has penetrated into the skin.  For a melanoma, this depth is called the "Breslow thickness," and it is highly predictive of dangerous spread.    Skin cancers are uniquely accessible to early recognition and diagnosis...  they're right there in front of your eyes.  It is a tragedy when they are missed and left to progress.  They can all be cured at an early stage.    I have looked around the Internet for some pictures...  not too gruesome, but these are all at an advanced stage (so they make better photographs),..  here they are...     Squamous cells cancers...  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...  AND  http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/graphi...    Rodent ulcers... http://eyepathologist.com/images/KL954.j... AND http://www.visualdxhealth.com/images/dx/...    Malignant melanoma...http://www.scumdoctor.com/images/maligna... AND http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-med... AND http://whyfiles.org/173skin_cancer/image...    Unfortunately all 3 types, squamous, rodent, and melanoma, - have "variant" forms or variations, but I guess that's what you have Skin Specialists for.    "Kaposi's Sarcoma" mentioned by the first Answerer, is a skin cancer normally only associated with HIV/Aids.    It's difficult to lump all skin cancers together into one survival figure, - it's like trying to lump apples, oranges and pears into one group.    Here is a good prediction graph for melanoma outlook, by Breslow thickness...  http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/stagin...    The other way of predicting the outlook, is by what is called "Staging."  This method applies to all tumors, actually, not just skin ones.  The tumor is given a "T. N. M. score."    "T" refers to the original Tumor.  You get a number score according to how big (thick)  it is.    "N" refers to local lymph Nodes.  You get a number score according to whether they are involved, or not.    "M" refers to Metastases (secondaries). You get a number according to the presence or absence of secondary spread to somewhere else.    Here is a good article about melanoma outlook by TNM Staging... scroll to half-way down the page... http://www.about-skin-disorders.com/arti...    I hope this is of some help.    Best wishes,    Belliger  (retired uk GP)|`|AA11020187	BCC and SCC are the easiest to treat and the most common. There are at least 1 million cases diagnosed each year, yet they account for about 0.1% of deaths due to cancer. Both of these cancers are very rarely hereditary.     Melanoma is very dangerous and very unpredictable. Survival depends on how soon it is caught and treated. When caught early and it is still superficial the 5-year survival rate is 80-100%. If it has metastasized the median survival is 6-7 months. Less than 10% of these cancers are hereditary.     Kaposis sarcoma is pretty rare, not known to be hereditary and not often the cause of death.|`|AA11492002	Of skin cancers, the killer is malignant melanoma which starts as an irregular mole and within a few months invades your body as a cancer. The other skin cancers are also dangerous but very slow growing appearing often with age and skin damage. The treatment is to remove the mole and check that the pathology is clear.     If you have mole that has changed color or shape see a dermatologist do not wait. Once the melanoma has invaded your body your five year chances of survival is 30% if the mole was on your arms or legs and less than 20% if on your head or torso. The average life expectancy is 30 weeks once the cancer has invaded your body from a mole.    The appropriate lifestyle is to get regular skin checks and wear sun screen between 10 AM and 3 PM if you are out in the sun. Melanoma is the third leading killer in Australia and should not be taken lightly...    I lost my mum and my six grade teacher to skin cancer.  I get regular skin checks and otherwise live life normally.

HHRcIGMSaa	Lumineers are permanently white.      Tip from Jo: you don't want to go any whiter than the whites of your eyes when selecting the color of your Lumineers or your teeth will look unnatural.  ------------------------  LUMINEERS ?  are porcelain veneers that offer the painless way to a permanently whiter and perfectly aligned smile. Your LUMINEERS dentist can apply these contact lens-thin "smile shapers" to teeth without any grinding or shaving, transforming teeth into a naturally beautiful smile that looks perfect for every individual. LUMINEERS can even be placed over existing crown or bridgework without having to replace them.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	they will stay whiter longer than natural teeth although they can still stain eventually so I would suggest drinking your Coffee and tea etc through a straw so it doesn't get on your teeth
6sPcYQr0aa	Austin G had good advice. I will just expand.  It doesnt really matter what you eat and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|dCF1UBUsaa	Egg whites are the best source of natural protein, fat free cottage cheese is good if you can eat it, beans are rich in fiber and protein, almonds and other nuts are good in moderation (fats, but healthy fats). I would just prepare to eat a crapload of egg whites as a majority of protein will come from either lean meats or whey protein or egg whites on a physique seeking meal plan. Whey protein is a great source, and its cheap. Whey is natural.

10AvUf8Jaa	A Hypochondriac is one who believes that when they hear something bad about a disease/illness and/or their symptoms, that they too have it. Just because you heard of one traumatic experience doesn't mean that you are a hypochondriac. I would be scared too. Now, if you continue to be bothered by it, or if it affects your life, then you need to go back to the doctor. You may have GAD...General Anxiety Disorder.|`|OzNfhmaEaa	I doubt it, it would have to happen many times.|`|FyIcIzIoaa	i think its normal to have anxious feelings when someone so close in age has died,but to let it consume who are is not healthy.  my feelings have always been,im going to take care of myself but ever happens happens,we all got to go sometime,some are young and some are very old. just live your life always like its the last day.
UpPWXRK4aa	Treadmills give you a full body workout, not only legs but abs, lower back, a little arms and great cardio. You are being forced to carry your own weight which is great. Only down side is it isn't the best for your knees and some find it boring. Running/jogging is the best form of cardio exercise, burns more calories than most exercises and is simple.
WXExyAlWaa	It depends on a lot of factors, like which drug and other information about their family life, but it could make them have trust or abandonment issues, or they could develop a complex where they feel they have to be the parent and take care of everyone else. They might feel that destructive behaviour is okay, or they might decide that that parent is weak and develop a hatred of weakness.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	It depends on the age and situation.    A young baby, if mom was on drugs while she was pregnant, could have withdrawal (or fas, if we're talking alcohol).    A young child will most likely have trouble bonding, become very fearful, not be cared for, have to act way too old for its age, be responsible for the parent, have to take care of younger siblings, etc.      A school age child will experience a lot of the same things of a young child, but also there may be fear, guilt, shame.  The instability of the home life has a huge effect on the child.  The child may start hanging on the streets or joining a gang, just to stay away from home.  The child may have free run of the house, since mom and/or dad are not there to tell them what to do.  They may have trouble in school.  Without a strong family support system, children usually just break down.    An teenager, well, will have a lot of the same things.  You may see a teen who uses drugs themselves.  They may be forced to care for younger siblings, etc.  You may see a teen who is angry, acts out, lives on the streets, which is often better than going home.    And an adult who knows their parent is using will probably be worried, scared, and embarrassed.    Hope this helps!

I get the compliments, and I don't boast at all.|`|ALqeqVcsaa	Hello my friend those things are things of the past now there are some technics that you can follow and you'll be ok with another 1,2, or even 3 inches more just check this out,,,http://alflopa415.penmatter.hop.clickban...|`|rKpstdUcaa	Flaccid size varies a lot, but your erect size is above average.  I think your all normal.|`|UE2wUzs1aa	I don't think they've ever done studies on flacid penis size just because it varies so much in men.  All guys know even their flacid size can vary.  If it's cold out, if you're feeling good, what kind of pants you're wearing, etc.  Some guys have those really tiny flacid penises but then when erect, they're pretty big.  Some dudes have bigger flacid penises and then don't grow then erect(growers and showers)    I'd guess flacid size could vary from 1 inch to 8 inches.  And too many variables to get accurate measurements.|`|GJ4H5GGMaa	These penis exercises are absolutely amazing and revolutionary to the Penis Enlargement industry. Whether you need length or girth (I needed both), the exercises offered on this site are genuine and work! Take my word for it, if it werent for Matters of Size and SizeGenetics I would not have gained 0.75" in girth and 1.3" in length in the short amount of time that it was. I am now 8.1" X6" and I plan on continuing these amazing exercises until I reach my final goal of 9.5" X 6". I'm hooked!  http://SizeGenetics.fr.nf
K2QwEM4raa	Plus White about 6 dollars at wal-mart works really well.|`|CKDpbgQWaa	Brushing your teeth with baking soda will accomplish the same thing.      I think a lot of the adverts for whitening toothpastes and such are bogus.  I have never heard of anyone actually getting their teeth whiter using any of them....well, except maybe Topol...Topal....ummmm, it's a smokers toothpaste.  My ex used it for a bit and it seemed to make a difference.  The rest.....can't say I've ever seen it.|`|enW5Iai0aa	i got my teeth professionally whitened for 100$. it worked really well. these white strips work, but are slower and a paaain. check out professionals around your area. dentists will charge alot, but there is different companies or businesses that can help|`|f6c272c9fb75c26074367ea2fd272306aa	Using baking soda or peroxide regularly can make your mouth & gums sore. A good scale & polish at the dentist & regular brushing are all you need. Your teeth are only as white as they are.
IxyTkpVHaa	just start playing with your self and stick things up our vagina.|`|OY6R4ZP1aa	watch pron. Rubb your vagina. Poke things in it. ect.|`|HQ3aNEk5aa	This is perfectly normal. At your age, you will start getting horny and you can't really change that. I got it too.  The best way is to: (and sorry if it seems weird!)  Find somewhere comfy (a soft cushion, etc)  Take off your pants and knickers.  Make sure no boys or parents can peek in at you (annoying, isn't it?)  Relax yourself, fantasizing masturbation or previous sexual acts(if poss) helps  Explore your body in any way you please. See what touch you enjoy.  There is a lump, on your vagina area nearest to you. You can touch is and stroke it, however you want.      There are superstitions that you go blind or that masturbating decreases your health. They are fakes, wrong, blah blah.  Remember, if your friend says its ok, its ok and many many professionals say that its completely normal, which it is.    A good website. Copy and paste or highlight and click go to website.  www.likeitis.org/periods.html     Hope I helped.|`|GyQEGpqTaa	Many teenagers have no idea to masturbate so they explore themselves, but if you have no idea where to start you could search on google. I am 13 (almost 14) and found this amazing website http://www.healthystrokes.com/  You can ask questions anonymously you can read other questions people have asked. There are religious pages, diagrams and on the links such as For you Males / For young females.

VmJmyAkmaa	No, that is not an effective way to lose weight and can cause some serious health issues.   Plain tea does not usually give you diarrhea. Unless you are talking about some kind of stimulant laxative tea. However, using that for weight loss causes more problems than its worth.  First of all, diarrhea causes your body to become dehydrated. This can lead to hypovolemic shock (which means your heart and other organs aren't getting enough blood).   It also drains your body of vital sodium and potassium. Low levels of these electrolytes can cause MANY health conditions as bad as muscle paralysis, coma and convulsions. These are vital electrolytes that your body needs to live.  You are going to malnourish your self.    Second of all, by doing this you are only going to slow down your metabolism, so that eventually you will gain all the weight back (probably plus some).    Bottom line is, calorie counting, portion control and exercise are the only effective, healthy, and permanent solutions to weight loss.     So unless you want an expensive trip to the emergency room because your body is so malnourished and your electrolytes are so out of wack and run a good risk of stopping your heart- you know have a heart attack... then don't do it.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	No. Well tea shouldn't really give you diarrhea. It sounds like shes lactose intolerant to the milk which is what is giving her the diarrhea.|`|UyHLvhloaa	The couple of pounds that she is loosing is due to dehydration from the diaheria, it's also making her loose important minerals and vitamins in her body. she is not loosing pounds of fat. and as soon as she gets off those laxative teas she will put it back on in a blink of an eye. You should never abuse laxatives hunn, it's not gonna make make you loos actual fat lbs, and it will harm your body if you use them in excess. Don't try it, and good luck.  |`|gfhp1Ctnaa	it works but its bad for your health because you loose all your minerals and water from your body. you could become really sick|`|YOGgHoNdaa	No you shouldn't try it . . .And I think you already know that because if you were really seriously I would thnk that you wouldn't rely on this site for your decision . .(hopefully)|`|zPOWL62xaa	No, do not try it. It is unnatural to induce diarrhea to lose weight. Your water and electrolyte balance would go out of whack and you could become dehydrated. It's a dangerous and a stupid idea. That is why people give infants special formulas when they have diarrhea.    Your friend is probably dehydrated and lost alot of water/nutrients which can cause unhealthy weight loss.    Talk to a doctor if you have weight issues.|`|sz4lAIjgaa	That's knida nasty. I work in a coffee shop and a few months ago i decided to drop some weight so i switched to sugar-free syrup in iced coffee for the morning, gives me tons of energy, and i drink iced tea in the afternoon. When i get home I eat a small dinner and then chill for a while. I run for about an hour and then chill some more. I have never tried the exlax approach but tea never gives me the runs. If you drink a black tea, which has the most caffeine then it should give you energy and it fill you up. I have lost 20 pounds now so it totally works for me.|`|sJqFcCRPaa	thank you for ruining my imagination of 17 y/o's never discharging feces....why not just use ex lax?? or both?? now that would make things interesting!!!
oMAXAQA0aa	He probably wont proceed if the jaw is still swollen shut. He might have to lance the area, if it is that type of swelling. You'll just wind up rescheduling if it's that bad. But if the meds work, you should be alright by Tuesday.

1a3bfffd0a710ae0f3fb16d3763f2cceaa	you probably just have a naturally slow metabolism.|`|qtgMy1zUaa	Try getting a personal trainer, you might be consuming more calories than you think, or something similar.|`|RczxgiQaaa	You may want to add up those calories... it almost looks like you're bordering on starvation mode.  If you're eating less than 1200 calories a day, it's going to be very difficult to lose fat, regardless of how much you workout.    You don't say whether you're male or female, or how old you are, but I'd hafta ask why you feel you need to lose weight.  You were in the middle of the normal BMI range at 147... now you're approaching the low end of normal at 137.  I'm a 5'10" guy who needs to lose *maybe* 10 pounds... and I weight 175!.
t8kaNEU2aa	You have to be overweight for a doctor to prescribe it to you.  Its almost impossible to get it online now days.  Yes, Phentermine works.
LJcVUnj1aa	Okaii well if you got prunes they really help. ( you should really get them even if someone has to go shops and get them for you)  Eating linseeds makes you go. but gives you bad tummy pains before.  Celery and dairy are supposed to give you diarhea?? (not too sure on that one but my mum swares by it) so  maybe drink lots of milk???  Grapes and Cherrys are great for giving you diarhea eat lots of them and you'll be going in no time! (Again if you havent got them in get someone to get them!)  To be honest your best bet is lots of watery fruits. There the only things that really help. And fruit juices are good.  Hoped this crap helps a little. Just stuff everyone says helps ( the watery fruit one i no helps!)|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	eat fruit and beans.  drink water.|`|AA10161551	like..poop?....my husbands grandma used to make them hit there knee caps and that made them go....|`|FJ8RvElZaa	Sauerkraut works for some people.

53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	I am on paxil and had some side effects, nothing too major, but they did go away after a couple weeks. I started having side effects after the first day of starting them.  If you go off of them do it under your drs. care.  I went off mine a couple years ago and I did it by weening off or it very, very slowly but I had no reactions from coming off of it that way.  This was under my drs. care to.  Recently I had to go back on it.|`|bGfsIb8qaa	im on paxil ive luckily enough not had no side effects like that all ive had a dry mouth from it but thats all i dont even get that much now the longer you take the meds the side effects do eventually dissapear
Awo7g1K4aa	it will hurt for a couple days. Like an 8. AFter that no pain.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	It does hurt some and I would give it a 5!|`|7sUkgaYSaa	It's not that it really hurts, it's just sore because your mouth is adjusting to having braces. I found I couldn't chew a lot of food, so for the first day I had milkshakes and soups. I'd say it's about a 6 or 7 out of 10. However when you get them tightened after that, it doesn't hurt as bad. Maybe only a 2.     I've had braces for 3 years now.|`|qQGjRpiZaa	Yes, they will hurt for a few days. Not bad though. Now, trying to eat is going to bother you and might make you cry. I recommend eating pasta for a few days. For the love of god don't try to eat a sandwich or a burger.|`|g1xY5l2Gaa	i got my braces about 2 months ago and it does hurt when they put them on an its till a cuople of hours later that they start hurting its like an aching pain but just have so pain killers it helps alot 4 maybe three da ys youll just have to have soft food cause it hurts to bite down on hard things but trust me its not as bad as people say i would say a 4 out of ten =)    ps it really hurt if you get smacked in the mouth|`|W8cf9Dxjaa	Getting them put on your teeth doesn't hurt at all. But it will probably hurt for like 7 days with like an 8 pain..but it does away so don't worry...plus it'll be worth it :)|`|aUZzPfCnaa	I really bad crooked teeth so when I woke up the first morning after my braces I hit my mouth by mistake and almost cried. I would say that the pain is about a 8-9 but after a week or so it doesn't hurt but everytime you get them tightend it will hurt again.|`|mSil7qObaa	Thery really don't hurt as bad as everyone says that they do. it will hurt for afew days after you get them but after that they are fine. i promise. and im not going to lie it will hurt for a little bit everytime you get them tightened but it really isn't bad. and when they tell you you can't eat a bunch of foods its not true. i ate all of the stuff they told me i couldn't  and i was fine.|`|f76ee846232baba707ef102c7f6c2e07aa	Well, everyone has a different take on it.  I personally didn't think that they hurt-it was just hard adjusting to having things in my mouth...it felt weird.  But then again, I also have a high tolerance for pain.  However, I can tell you that getting them on doesn't really hurt, but afterwords it might hurt for like a week.  It's nothing too bad, and then you get used to them.  Just remember to use lots of wax because your braces might cut up your cheeks and gums!  I rate the pain a 5.|`|EMnKizXkaa	it does hurt for the first couple days, the pain will be between 6-8 but after that it wont hurt. But when its time to get them tighten it will hurt again because your teeth are adjusting. so try not to eat food that requires alot of chewing when you get your braces tighten, it will hurt like a 12.
HgRYP3cJaa	No, I feel the same most of the time. It has to do with being surrounded by stupid people.    It will pass.
W2YtVUqKaa	yeah you are a bit under weight. you should be around 115. don't just think about losing weight I mean it's not sexy for us guys to see a girl with bones sticking out. a little curve looks good! and remember curves not bulges! also try exercising so you ll look toned and fit and that is sexy.     so the synopsis is fit and toned = HAWT     skinny = unhealthy and a turn off     remember that it's in our genes to seek out females that looks healthy so we can make sure we pass on our genes and if you look like a stick we don't really want that so good luck|`|EAApPFvKaa	You Should weigh between 105 and 120.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	You are underweight to the point of being unhealthy.

qK8wcP2Aaa	definitely consult a doctor. weight loss is one symptom of an underlying disease or condition.. it may be stress, but we don't know for sure right? migraines & vision disturbances should not be ignored. though yellow pee is normal (it means your kidneys are working efficiently)     it may or may not be serious, but i suggest you go see a doctor asap. it's for your own good, & peace of mind.    good luck :)|`|QsQj8jO7aa	go see multiple doctors, general practitioners will do. I say go see at least 2 or 3 different ones. Doctors are not always right, so seeing more than 1 and comparing their medical opinions and telling them your doing so is the best way to approach something like this. You should also let them know what medications the other doctors have prescribed.|`|7nTJKhW6aa	i would go c a doctor|`|nt6ouk57aa	i would suggest seeing a doctor.  i don't think its very serious or anything,  but i would think that those symptoms are very irritating.|`|8ZUSL5MIaa	you should have blood work done asap  it could be a symptom of something minor  however ...the symptoms could also be related to something a bit more serious...please go to your doctor|`|675b031de6e08b5828f575b2d23001c4aa	i don't know actually but i think such thing affects all these systems in ur body have to do with ur nervous system..specially the eye part..i think u should go to a neurologist.

Hope that helped.|`|oGv4wJgtaa	im sure if you look it up on the internet you will find out, on google or sumink  he could possibly have a STI  or hes just not washing it properly,  id get it check out soon  it might be more serious then you think    id tell him, if he hasnt relised then he needs to know!!!!|`|f1edb421795af7f9f21de4ad71e484aeaa	The doctor will give him something to take 4 times a day .........SOAP|`|YJGEEJhWaa	I would tell my boyfriend! in a nice way, he should understand! if he does have an std you better get checked out as well -xxx|`|rnQjDbAdaa	Either he has an STD that's causing infection which would cause the smell or he is just not into showering.  The white goo was just precum and that is normal.  I would ask him if he has been with other girls and tell him you want to get tested for STD's together so he doesn't get offended.  If he says hes a virgin don't just take his word for it because boys lie and you don't want an STD too do you?  If neither of you has an STD he probably just is a typical teenage guy and doesn't shower regularly.  Try giving subtle hints, like for Valentines Day buy him an Axe gift set or something.  My boyfriend loves getting this stuff for gifts because it's something that he will actually use.  Hopefully your gift will give him some incentive to shower more often.  If all else fails you might just have to tell him that if he wants regular BJs he's gonna have to clean his penis better.  Good luck!|`|OnzUAVdUaa	just tell him but in a nice way and then tell him to go to the doctor cuz he might have an STD.    gross|`|xL0nkrqBaa	that sounds like an infection to me,  you shoul'dnt be scared to tell him, because if its an STD and you had sex recently its possible he may have passed it on to you.                                                SO i think both of you should see your gp.
hBmafVYoaa	I'd go pretty sharpish to the doctor|`|E2Bdez4Iaa	Are you sure it's blood? Maybe it's whatever you'd eaten before? But if it is, it is probably best to go to the doctor just in case.

LJcVUnj1aa	It certainly sounds like IBS. it depends on how long you've had it for. if its just been a few days then its more then likely a bug. Concerning IBS doctors tend to give you medication based on whether your IBS is diarrhea based or constipation based. Obviously if its diarhea based mainly and they give you meds to relax the bowels then when you do have constipation this makes it worse and visa versa. However there will always be foods that make you worse and foods that seem to ease the symptoms but as everyone is different only you can distingish these foods. Seems best thing to do would be to talk it through with a doctor. They will be able to help you more. If your really against seeing a doctor then the only other advice i can give you is eat a healthy balanced diet with plenty of exercise and see how that works. Hope i helped :)
BVwDoV81aa	Wouldn't think you could be asleep and drown as the body has an automatic wake up mechanism however being drunk wherby the body is unconscious(not asleep) then yup you could drown.     But hey who runs a bath when they're drunk, most people I know if they're drunk can't even get their clothes off !|`|ToztjpAsaa	Drowning is not an easy, comfortable way to die.  I think you'd wake up.  However, there's a world of difference between sleep and a drunken stupour.|`|2NX67BdWaa	Yes!! especially if you have had too much alcohol.|`|c8Nah2iCaa	I don't think so because your body panics when it cant breathe and you'd wake up.    But i really dont know. let me know if you find out!|`|7ec1aa38a5171789cb76c4135993d94caa	Sober - unlikely    Drunk - likely    Moral - Shower when drunk (although you may slip and crack your head open - better to just stink till morning)|`|G3eYnXhFaa	they say you can drown in a few inches of water  especially if you have had alcohol, as most people would go into a deep sleep therefore would not wake up when they start breathing in water  i would imagine it would take a couple of minutes?|`|sZZdDziqaa	Yes you can. You would normally be woken up instantly if falling asleep in the bath. But if unconcious or incapable of geting back up, you will drown. As long as the bath is big enough that is, i dont think my body would be able to slip down far enough for the water to cover my mouth|`|fs6I4Xleaa	yes you can, you fall asleep slide under and breath in water, it would take the same amount of time as if you were awake|`|8VEEihaqaa	If it's just plain old sleep, no you can't.  Your body would respond once the water hit your nose (like when you get water up your nose and it hurts really bad), because falling asleep is a gradual process.    You would need to already be unconscious when you hit the water.|`|mZ7kzNm6aa	it is possible but only if your a very heavy sleeper
27qNNHvoaa	it's called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. just take your time getting up and don't make any sudden movements until you feel normal again.    i don't know about the bloody noses though... never had one of those.|`|L89oYYbUaa	It could be high blood pressure.  You should definitely see a doctor.  Don't let this go on too long without medical advice.
PgxU0gBeaa	Yes!  Even vasectomies aren't 100% effective.  Its extremely rare for it to happen, but it can.  Especially if the tubes are clamped, not clipped.   Before you get a vasectomy (or tubal for women), your doctor will require you to sign a paper saying you understand that its not 100% effective and you can't sue if you do conceive a child.  But the odds are less than 1 in 500 ppl.|`|Caa2zTrfaa	ya it is if you have it reversed|`|3AY5lS9saa	Yes a vasectomy is reversable|`|6wujZ9D7aa	i think its a joke too sorry|`|AA11605300	If it can still be reversible by a doctor, yes!|`|OP7lLIitaa	yes it doesnt always stay cut i had a friend that this happened to they even did a dna test|`|kAw0tF20aa	I hope this question is a joke.
rnQjDbAdaa	Medically there is nothing wrong with masturbating while on your period, it's just a little messy.  However if you are willing to deal with the mess and you want to do it, there is nothing wrong with that.  Your period doesn't actually get heavier when you masturbate.  The extra flow is just your wetness from being aroused.  Nothing to worry about!|`|byHh0A3Eaa	I think it's fine if you do it in the shower. That's the only place I'll do a girl on her period. i'll ride the red river but I won't sip from it.|`|VC8ivJHjaa	It is fine, although messy. No limit, you can do it several time daily throughout your menstrual cycle. Your period may APPEAR to get heavier simply because of the amount of increased "juices" flowing.|`|AA11605300	Masturbate away. there is no danger and it won't affect the flow.|`|LQ04emc3aa	its okay,   but it gets heavier when your body is tired,   and well mastrubating makes you tired.  lol|`|GQzg7HTmaa	one time at band camp i masterbated when i had my period and the next week i found out that i was laying eggs in my bed sheets|`|AA11987492	Yep, just make sure you have some towels underneath you!|`|uxMxWxvuaa	nothing will happen but i wouldnt do it|`|tO7e262zaa	It is ok to masturbate during your period. However many times you want. Your period gets heavier because of you climaxing. Just for a little at least if you don't continue to masturbate it will go back to normal|`|ci8dSwKLaa	I don't think it causes any harm to do so. Since girls can have sex during their period, there isn't much of a difference.   & As for your period getting heavier during masturbation, it's probably because your vagina is being stimulated? I don't know.|`|xmr7W8ndaa	Back in the day - it used to be believed that an orgasm during your period could cause some infections, but this has proved to be false.    And an orgasm during your period helps to relieve cramps.

AA10426969	The eating thousands of calories and puking it back up definately sounds like the classic bulemic "binge and purge."    Maybe you should talk to a doctor.|`|fvuEtkROaa	You don't give your height or your age, but 109 is quite a low weight for anybody near adulthood who is more than 5"3".

	YES .|`|	Just like a girl. During puberty. So before, since they need puberty to happen before they can ejaculate.|`|	Yes.|`|	I can't remember which one happened to me first.|`|	yes|`|	Yeah it does, maybe even a year before.|`|	Oh I could say something bad. You might like it lol. I have not the slightest clue.|`|	it all happens around the same time,for me it was 13 but cant remember which came first...pull away regardless ...|`|	My pubic hair came before ejaculation, but i had masturbated before.|`|	It can depend on the boy...|`|	Mhm|`|	It depends on the guy.  For me, I had a full bush before I came, but for my friend, he's been able to ejaculate for like a year, but no pubes yet.|`|	it's not manditory dude,,, but it is puberty, and most of us are gonna prolly have a few pubes before our balls drop, and we can ejaculate ;-)|`|	Generally speaking, yes it does. It's one of the first signs of puberty. But not always.|`|	yes it does|`|	Depends on the guy and how much hair he will tend to eventually have.  Most guys never even think about sex or ejaculating until they have a few hairs if not a complete bush, but I knew a kid in school that was hairless down there, didn't shave, but was sexually active at 12.|`|	I certainly remember ejaculating well before I had any pubic hairs because I remember thinking that it will be harder to clean up with the hairs there.|`|	That depends.  Smetimes yes, sometimes no.    -Connor|`|	typically hair comes first, but not always|`|	Yes It Does.
7igxiGrAaa	Special K is not one of the best breakfasts out there. Try egg whites or egg beaters, some fruit and oatmeal. Milk, while it does the body good, is only additional calories in the terms of dieting. Drink water, coffee (without milk and sugar), or tea.   Pretzels are not the best carbs either, substitute for rice or a potato. The salt content, if you are eating pretzels with salt, will not help your water retention. Cut salt out of your diet.  Try eating small amounts of food more often. Every 2-3 hours you should eat a small amount of food, it will keep your metabolism going.  By small amounts I mean like 1/2 cup of carb and a healthy protein like chicken, turkey or fish. Beef, pork, sausage, etc. are not diet friendly. And add some veggies into your lunch. Make a nice healthy sized Chicken salad with romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers and some grilled (not fried or cooked in oil) chicken strips!|`|qSMF6QIYaa	3,500 calories = a pound.  If you eat 500 cal's you'll gain 1/10 of a pound.  if you exersise approx an hour and burn 500 cal's youll lose that 1/10 pound.    Find out how many calories youre eating and you have to exersise that so many times to get the weight off.    Ex: Lets say you ate 3,500 cal's...You have to burn off more than to lose wieght, and if you burn exactly the same you'll stay that wieght.    Ask the gym person what exersises burn what calories.    fierce mountian biking burns 600 cals an hour (i think)    EX2: Apple = 20 cals (not really but just an ex)  Walking for an hour burns 20 cals. (again not really just an ex)   So walking will only get rid of that apple, not the bar and dinner and cereal and whatnot.|`|RzZBU8elaa	thank god your not loosing any weight.do you know how many fat people wish they were weighed what you do? why dont you ask your parents to get you some therapy it seems like you need it.m especially if you think you need to loose weight. i wonder how you would feel if you 5"1 and 225 pounds? youd probably kill yourself|`|GA5BAhaRaa	Here is your biggest problem: empty calories.  The special k, the pretzels, and any other white breads or pastas you're eating are NOT good for you. They're high on the GI and are doing nothing for your heath. Try to eat more whole wheat or whole grain foods (multigrain is NOT whole grain) and more vegetables. Also, the foods you're eating are probably high in sodium, so watch out for that--drink lots of water so you don't feel bloated or retain that water weight.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  Good luck and God bless.|`|xj9LLpzRaa	Yeah, eating more healthy stuff may help.     I'm 17, trying to lose a few pounds, and diet and exercise alone isn't helping me that much either. It's like I've reached a stagnant point where I can't lose anymore weight.     I like to do kick boxing and yoga. They're enjoyable workouts and I've had some pretty good results with them. Yoga is good for toning--getting lean muscle. And kick boxing is a great cardio workout.     Good luck and stay healthy! :)|`|lgk3HTFRaa	Try eating more. Replace the pretzels and the bar at lunch with something more nutritious like bread. And add something in between your meals, like an extra piece of fruit.|`|sJqFcCRPaa	anorexia is the answer!|`|AA10692979	Why 105?  Is this the weight a Doctor recommended?  Your 15 so your weight should be not to skinny or to heavy. Your body is still developing, you could do permanant damage.|`|NzWY5ECgaa	You're probably not losing weight because your body is at its set point. While there will be slight variations, your body wants to keep itself at a certain point. Diet and exercise will keep you healthy, but if you're still staying at the same weight with a healthy diet and exercise, then there is really nothing wrong.    And while being thinner may sound like it will make you feel good about yourself, it probably won't if you ever get there, because you're basing your self around how good you COULD be, rather than how good you are. So chances are that even if you do reach that weight (which at your size would probably require starvation or anorexia through excessive exercise) it still won't make you happy, you'll just be setting another goal for weight loss.    If the source of your desire to be thin is a feeling that you're somehow not normal, it may help you to look at some websites that show how things like photoshop are used to make pretty much all women in the mainstream media look different from how they actually are.
eCKNRcIVaa	It likely is the flu, but if she has become dehydrated from all of the vomiting and diarrhea then she may be in trouble.  Get her to a doctor if she can't keep fluids down they can give her something to stop the diarrhea and stop the vomiting.  Ask for zofran for the vomiting|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Ever heard of going to the hospital because I mean there are doctors there that could give you an actual answer instead of a guess|`|ZwY4PVTtaa	get her to the doctors if this continues.and good luck, i hope she feels better. :( .|`|OXLJPgUlaa	i am pretty sure your guess was right.  the stomach flu has been going around and i heard its really bad.  i've already seen this kind of question a couple of times this week so a lott of people must be getting it.

But becareful that you don't get it.  try looking up some tips on google on preventing it.|`|Xxkt6Jd9aa	its most likely  the stomach flu. its contagious, so lets say your mom drank out of your dads cup or something there is a big chance she got it.

eCKNRcIVaa	Here is what you do... Go to a doctor.  Get a pelvic exam.  You say you haven't had sex but it does sound an awful lot like a herpes outbreak.  You can get herpes without having full on sexual intercourse so if you have had any skin to skin contact in the area it is still a possibility.   The only way to know is to get to a doctor ASAP while the sores are still there so they can see them and test them.. Herpes matches with the body aches etc.  Often the first herpes outbreak feels like the flu|`|9l0GdKbbaa	Have you recently had oral sex with anyone?

You're a good friend.  Now:  GO!|`|AA11535448	call him now.  Anyone who blacks out without reason, or who falls and hits the head should be checked out by a doctor.  He's done both, and now is unexpectedly out-of-contact.    Call him, and it you don't get an answer - go round if it's close by, or try and find a relative or friend closer.
KkhlLy2Haa	Try drinking warm green tea and getting a lot of rest.|`|PLu40QgBaa	Doctor can give you something to help get rid of it fast.  Besides that over the counter stuff you can take, but that stuff doesnt work well in my opinion.
kTYw3LgYaa	It might be a blood sugar issue.  When your blood sugar is off, the main signs are fatigue and dizziness.  Even if he isn't hungry, make sure he is eating every 4 hours, even if it is something small, like a piece of fruit. The other thing you might look into is acupuncture.  My fiance had a similar problem with blacking out-acupuncture did wonders for him...plus no drugs or side effects.|`|145f9a95b73fc930d5481d771b203c24aa	Despression.|`|AVllw5YWaa	i felt like that in the begining stage of mono.  if he starts getting body aches, he might definatly what to see a doctor.  best of luck to you!  :)|`|4aa5ec2b493db915bb99fb24d191aa9baa	Sounds like mono, need to get a blood test for it, no kissing till he gets tested, because you can get it too
GfyovDF5aa	Anemia is the most common deficency in the United States.  You should definetly be taking iron supplements if you are anemic.  Are you a vegetarian?  If not, I would eat some very lean red meat.  If you are a vegetarian, breakfast cereals are a good source of iron so I would eat that too.  Are you usually very tired? I would go to the doctor if you have lost that much hair.  How is the rest of your diet?
Phjj2Gr3aa	If you want to lose weight, your best bet is to exercise and eat healthier.  But don't go for those diets that everyone advertises.  They don't work and they are really expensive.  Instead, try to eat soup and vegetables and meat.  If you have the choice of Wawa or McDonald's, go to Wawa because you can get a healthy sub or fruit.  Also, try to run some, or join a gym.  If you don't have time for that, do something that strains your body.  For example, when you are in the car, lift your legs a bit instead of just resting them on the floor.  There are many more things that you can try, too.|`|4RCf3wyxaa	You'll be alright. 1 extra kg won't make you fat or kill you.|`|B1CH2L26aa	lose weight?
vn0DHMXWaa	Either you are smoking stronger cigarettes or you are inhaling deeper or holding longer. You are probably just smoking a few cigarettes a day right now, and the solution is to smoke more for a day or two. Smoke until you get dizzy, then stop and wait just a short time, until you feel better. Drink CocaCola to help you get over it, then smoke some more. After 5 or 6 cigarettes in a 2 or 3 hour period you will be able to smoke a whole cigarette without getting dizzy.|`|9c2inRKaaa	If you know smoking is bad for you...then STOP.    Do you not understand english or do you have an IQ of a brick wall?    See you in the back of my ambulance, with a Firefighter compressing your chest, me putting a tube down your throat, my partner starting 2 IVs and hooking you up to a defibrillator, and another Firefighter getting ACLS drugs ready.

Dizzyness nothing serious just little yuck to the stomache. My friends get it too still and their in their 30's.|`|BeQQsyJJaa	Golly!    No, stop smoking, that probably is a sign that your body can't take it anymore, or just doesn't want it, you need to stop.  Try chewing gum instead of smoking or something else.  You are hurting the world, your community, and mostly friends and family.    -stain fingers Dx  -yellow gross teeth D;  -baggy eyes 0_o  -pimples wrinkles... -_-  -cancer, stop  before its too late    STOP! there are other things you can resort to besides smoking.|`|l4anfnt7aa	Yeah, smoking is bad. But I'm an ex-smoker so I understand both sides of the equation here. Just never forget that each time you do it you are hurting yourself, and you might never become 100% healed even if you decide to quit.    Anyway, I know you didn't want to be preached at so to really address your question: Nicotine effects aside, there are two things that happen that come to mind, when you smoke. One is that because you aren't inhaling regular air like your body expects, you are getting less oxygen in that breath. The dizziness could be caused by momentary anoxia (lack of oxygen) to the brain. Also.. while you are in the act of smoking, the amount of oxygen carried in your bloodstream is also reduced -- which again goes to less oxygen in your body. If you hold your breath for a long time you get dizzy as well, this is the same basic effect.|`|CFSfyXCbaa	Smoking is Injurious to Health  If you cant leave without smoking, than better prepare well for many changes on your health in future...|`|15jfF0tKaa	way back in the day I also would have the side effect of of dizziness when smoking and I quit it when my throat started closing up on me. These are reactions to be becareful with any drug|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Its because your having a nicotine rush. So let me get this straight you enjoy inhaling disgusting smoke just to get insanley light headed and pale and feeling like ****? Wow, what a life.  Have fun dieing!|`|8RvBvksyaa	sounds like either blood pressure or blood sugar levels going wrong, dont smoke!!!|`|4w7lsoj7aa	Your lungs are now so full of whatever is in cigarettes that your lungs have become sticky and black, cancer has also probably already started to form in your lungs, the light headedness is because your body isn't getting enough oxygen, because your lungs are so bad.|`|3xJqb2HMaa	It could be a myriad of reasons. When you smoke, it effects the oxygenation of your red blood cells, which can then lead to making you dizzy. It could also be because of your weight, if you are especially skinny. If you have an empty stomach, it can effect you, and that might be why you feel the need to drink something, so that it will fill up your stomach. Also, people who have not yet built up a tolerance will feel side effects that others do not, because their body is still learning to adapt to the foreign substance that you are putting in your body. It should wear off soon, if you smoke for awhile or if you decide to smoke more a day, your tolerance for it might go up, therefore ridding of the dizziness. Hope that helps!!|`|0QTCiCf8aa	I cant tell you why you get dizzy but i can tell you it is normal, it happens to me when I smoke after I go long periods with out smoking. I wouldn't worry to much about it, unless it gets intolerable, but all a DR will tell you is to quit...|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	I know, I smoke and enjoy it as well. But, it is obviously having a detrimental effect on your health if you are getting dizzy. Cigarettes are loaded with tons of toxic crap. Probably why you are getting dizzy. You could TRY switching brands or if you are smoking full strength switch to lights (if you smoke lights switch to ultra lights) OR you could (and probably SHOULD) try quitting. I know it will be hard since it's not something you want to do and it's actually something you enjoy, but I'm going to try quitting myself here pretty soon in plans of getting pregnant. So, I do understand. There are help options available: the gum, the patch, the medication Chantix (prescription only)...look into those! It's better to quit now and decrease your risk of all the diseases that come with smoking. COPD (terrible to watch people struggling to breathe), Lung Cancer, heart disease, bladder cancer, throat & esophageal cancer, etc. I am not hear to preach, because I hate those holier-than-thou-never-smoked-a-day-in-m... preachers, or even worse the holier-than-thou-reformed-smokers preachers! But, I do see people everyday with these terrible diseases caused by smoking in my line of work. Good luck!    http://www.chantix.com/content/Chantix_B...|`|xhH3cB1Raa	dizziness is coused by nicotine rush|`|RQc8fbjbaa	It is because smoking causes you to not get enough oxygen into your lungs.

Walgreens used to sell a test for 15.99 to check to see. I did my son a dumb mj smoker with long term mj markers. He has stayed in landscaping to avboid the drug testing that the whole world does now. Especially in the health related sector. Dang I used to have nurses next to me lift their patients narcotics. Then they started double counting narcotics and it would be a royal pain in the butt when your working with a fly girl.

QMAqzpKEaa	I don't know you. But oes any of this sound familar?    The manic phase of bipolar disorder, feelings of heightened energy, creativity, and euphoria are common. People experiencing a manic episode often talk a mile a minute, sleep very little, and are hyperactive. They may also feel like theyre all-powerful, invincible, or destined for greatness.     But while mania feels good at first, it has a tendency to spiral out of control. People often behave recklessly during a manic episode-gambling away savings, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making foolish business investments, for example. They may also become angry, irritable, and aggressive, picking fights, lashing out when others dont go along with their plans, and blaming anyone who criticizes their behavior.    These are types and degrees of bipolar disease:  Bipolar I Disorder  Mania and depression   Bipolar I Disorder is the classic manic-depressive form of the illness, as well as the most severe type of bipolar disorder. It is characterized by at least one manic episode or mixed episode. Although a previous episode of major depression is not required for diagnosis, the vast majority of people with Bipolar I Disorder have experienced one. The typical course of Bipolar I Disorder involves recurring cycles between mania and depression.   Bipolar II Disorder  Hypomania and depression   In Bipolar II disorder, the person doesnt experience full-blown manic episodes. Instead, the illness involves episodes of hypomania and severe depression. In order to be diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder, you must have experienced at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode in your lifetime. If you ever have a manic episode, your diagnosis would be changed to Bipolar I Disorder.   Cyclothymia  Hypomania and mild depression   Cyclothymia, also known as cyclothymic disorder, is a milder form of bipolar disorder. Like bipolar disorder, cyclothymia consists of cyclical mood swings. However, the highs and lows are not severe enough to qualify as either mania or major depression. To be diagnosed with cyclothymia, you must experience numerous periods of hypomania and mild depression over at least a two-year time span. Because people with cyclothymia are at an increased risk of developing full-blown bipolar disorder, it is a condition that should be monitored and treated.   Rapid Cycling  Frequent episodes of mania, hypomania, or depression   Rapid cycling is a subtype of bipolar disorder characterized by four or more episodes of mania, hypomania, or depression within one year. The shifts from low to high can occur over a matter of days or hours. Rapid cycling can occur within any type of bipolar disorder. It usually develops later in the course of bipolar disorder, but it is sometimes just a temporary condition  I would go and talk to a doctor because it could just be a simple case of depression.  Stress - Severe stress or emotional trauma can trigger either depression or mania in someone with a genetic vulnerability to bipolar disorder. Stress can also worsen a bipolar mood episode or extend its duration.   Major Life Event - Major life events both good and bad can trigger an episode of bipolar disorder. These events tend to involve drastic or sudden changes, such as getting married, going away to college, starting a new job, or retiring.   Substance Abuse - While substance abuse doesnt cause bipolar disorder, it can bring on an episode and worsen the course of the disease. Drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, and amphetamines can trigger mania, while alcohol and tranquilizers can trigger depression.   Medication - Certain medications, most notably antidepressant drugs, can trigger mania. Other drugs that may induce mania include over-the-counter cold medicine, appetite suppressants, caffeine, corticosteroids, and thyroid medication.   Seasonal Changes -   Episodes of mania and depression often follow a seasonal pattern. Manic episodes are more common during the summer, and depressive episodes more common during the fall, winter, and spring.   Sleep Deprivation  Loss of sleepeven as little as skipping a few hours of restcan trigger an episode of mania.   Treatments include Lithium, Valproic Acid, Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine. Unfortunately, these have side-effects.   It is best to gain advice as to what may be best for you.  Bipolar is caused by stress, biological or genetic reasons.    It's not crazy and if you are indeed biploar then it's not your fault. Seek professional help now while you're young before it's too late and affects your life. But it might not necessarily be bipolar. You need to speak to your doctor.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Stress levels??|`|pSNex1a1aa	hormones?   It might be PMS.    how old are you?|`|bwJSJ49Oaa	Are you eating properly? Try doing a food diary to keep track of what you're eating and how you feel in the next few hours/day after you've eaten it.  Sounds stupid I know but I've only just realised it makes a huge difference to how I feel, eg if I've not had much one day, skipped meals etc I feel really exhausted, lacking in energy and proper depressed the next day.  When I'm eating properly I feel so much more optimistic full of life etc the next day.  Also exercise? That plays a huge part.  Are you in a transitional stage of your life right now? Like, have you had the same way of life for ages now and you're maybe subconsciously feeling unhappy with your lot which really gets you down, but then the really positive side to your personality makes you pick yourself up and get on with it again? If it's that, have a good look at your whole life in general and see if theres anything you can change to get the actual life you want? We're here for such a limited time, just go for it and do whatever you need to do to make yourself happy!|`|HPgYry8Uaa	If You Feel Depressed Check Out This Web Site It May Be able To Help You http://hotshorturl.com/tk54|`|Q2JbXBJGaa	yep sounds bipolar lots of treatment available see the doctor and possibly psychotherapy/counselling|`|NF80kaBDaa	check with your doctor. could be Bipolar|`|Td5fhanEaa	From your accounts, this seems to subjectively mimic certain symptoms of manic-depressive illness, (Bipolar Disorder). Although there is too little information presented for comparison with diagnostic criteria. If you could elaborate more on the highs and lows, (i.e. the lows are quite reminiscent of depression, irritability, sleeplessness, fatigue, low motivation, loss of hope and enjoying everyday things, and for the highs decreased need for sleep, exaggerated optimism, unusually high energy, racing thoughts, highly talkative.) If this appears familiar then you may want to do some research on the following: cyclothymia, hypomania, and dysthymia. Although it takes a doctor for a proper diagnosis, speaking with your health care provider about these issues would prove to be prudent if you feel familiar with several of the before mentioned symptoms.

dyhk0zbZaa	Hello Charlie A.    I am a plastic surgeon in Utah, http://www.yorkyates.com, and came across your question.  I would be very skeptical about any cream or pill claiming breast enlargement or tightening.  They make fabulous claims but at this point there is no evidence that there would be any improvement whatsoever.  Also, make sure that your surgeon in a board certified plastic surgeon (by the American Board of Plastic Surgery).  You can check at http://www.abplsurg.org.      Ask your doctor about your restrictions but generally you feel a little lousy for about a week.  I do not let patients return to the gym for 6 weeks except light exercise.  The biggest problem with a lift and implants at the same time is the scar.  Generally this is not nearly as hidden or small as the scar from implants alone and is often a little wide due to the opposite direction of pull from the implant and lift.|`|F6FcFmWJaa	Breast Enlargement by going under the knife should be avoided since recuperation will be long ,it will be painful and costly.

You may also become insensitive around the nipple area and may have to be operated upon every 10 years  Try the natural way first before lying below the knife

uqMK3rUZaa	While there are online tests and quizzes, the exact ones used by professionals cannot be posted online because it's not ethical. So I've read. There are plenty of sites online that explain which side of the brain controls what abilities (math, reading, writing, spatial reasoning, etc.). Some IQ tests are slanted to measure a certain type of intelligence. There are many types of intelligence (reading, music, math, science, reasoning, etc.).      Linguistic intelligence ("word smart"):   Logical-mathematical intelligence ("number/reasoning smart")   Spatial intelligence ("picture smart")   Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence ("body smart")   Musical intelligence ("music smart")   Interpersonal intelligence ("people smart")   Intrapersonal intelligence ("self smart")   Naturalist intelligence ("nature smart")   http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_...  http://www.dmps.k12.ia.us/schools/2Goodr...

W2z5dCrmaa	Girls grow taller sooner than Dudes, but usually stop earlier as well. HGH human growth hormones of which estrogen is one, does a sooner growth process on girls.    Other HGH hormones do a slower or later growth process on a males skeletal structure, and then testosterone kicks in to do the final product so there are in fact two growth stages taking place. The testosterone fills out structure as well as adding more in being tall and completes the puberty sexual work on the body, like package and masculine traits. Most males grow in some say and some overall degree until age 21 to 25.    There is no doubt that you will gain some additional height  between now and age 25.     You just need to eat the right protein building blocks, minerals like calcium in fresh green veggies, vitamin d, a men's Power vitamin supplement,  get good exercise, rest and lots of water...  chill, and  enjoy being You! :- )  and let nature do the job for You! :- )    Me! :- )|`|USxxSS7qaa	I stopped growing at 12, but my cousin grew until she was 20.

Not all women with PCOS share the same symptoms. These are some of the symptoms of PCOS:        * infrequent menstrual periods, no menstrual periods, and/or irregular bleeding      * infertility (not able to get pregnant) because of not ovulating      * increased hair growth on the face, chest, stomach, back, thumbs, or toesa condition called hirsutism (HER-suh-tiz-um)      * ovarian cysts      * acne, oily skin, or dandruff      * weight gain or obesity, usually carrying extra weight around the waist      * insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes      * high cholesterol      * high blood pressure      * male-pattern baldness or thinning hair      * patches of thickened and dark brown or black skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs      * skin tags, or tiny excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area      * pelvic pain      * anxiety or depression due to appearance and/or infertility      * sleep apneaexcessive snoring and times when breathing stops while asleep     [Return to Top]  Why do women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have trouble with their menstrual cycle?    Normal Ovary and Polycystic Ovary    The ovaries are two small organs, one on each side of a woman's uterus. A woman's ovaries have follicles, which are tiny sacs filled with liquid that hold the eggs. These sacs also are called cysts. Each month about 20 eggs start to mature, but usually only one matures fully. As this one egg grows, the follicle accumulates fluid in it. When that egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release it. The egg then travels through the fallopian tube for fertilization. When the single egg leaves the follicle, ovulation takes place.    In women with PCOS, the ovary doesn't make all of the hormones it needs for any of the eggs to fully mature. Follicles may start to grow and build up fluid. But no one follicle becomes large enough. Instead, some follicles may remain as cysts. Since no follicle becomes large enough and no egg matures or is released, ovulation does not occur and the hormone progesterone is not made. Without progesterone, a woman's menstrual cycle is irregular or absent. Plus, the cysts make male hormones, which also prevent ovulation.  [Return to Top]  Does polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) change at menopause?    Yes and no. Because PCOS affects many systems in the body, many symptoms persist even though ovarian function and hormone levels change as a woman nears menopause. For instance, excessive hair growth continues, and male pattern baldness or thinning hair gets worse after menopause. Also, the risks of complications from PCOS, such as heart attack, stroke and diabetes, increase as a woman gets older.  [Return to Top]  What tests are used to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?    There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will take a medical history, perform a physical exam, and possibly take some tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms. During the physical exam the doctor will want to measure your blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and waist size. He or she also will check out the areas of increased hair growth, so try to allow the natural hair growth for a few days before the visit. Your doctor might want to do a pelvic exam to see if your ovaries are enlarged or swollen by the increased number of small cysts. A vaginal ultrasound also might be used to examine the ovaries for cysts and check out the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. The uterine lining may become thicker if your periods are not regular. You also might have blood taken to check your hormone levels and to measure glucose (sugar) levels.  [Return to Top]  How is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated?    Because there is no cure for PCOS, it needs to be managed to prevent problems. Treatment goals are based on your symptoms, whether or not you want to become pregnant, and lowering your chances of getting heart disease and diabetes. Many women will need a combination of treatments to meet these goals. Some treatments for PCOS include:    Birth control pills. For women who don't want to become pregnant, birth control pills can control menstrual cycles, reduce male hormone levels, and help to clear acne. However, the menstrual cycle will become abnormal again if the pill is stopped. Women may also think about taking a pill that only has progesterone, like Provera?, to control the menstrual cycle and reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. (See Does polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) put women at risk for other health problems?) But progesterone alone does not help reduce acne and hair growth.    Diabetes medications. The medicine metformin (Glucophage?) is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It also has been found to help with PCOS symptoms, although it is not FDA-approved for this use. Metformin affects the way insulin controls blood glucose (sugar) and lowers testosterone production. Abnormal hair growth will slow down, and o|`|L2xa4gvYaa	well i dont know that much only cause i am going to school to be a medical assistant..but that and ovarian cancer is sometimes really hard to diagnose..my suggestion is if you want the best doc, find a St. joeseph i think i spelt that right..but find that hospital and the docs their are amazing....but if someone says that you have cysts, i think it would be true, especially if they saw it with and mri...but if they gave u meds, maybe it went away and then came back, but i hope everything goes well for you.....|`|DN9RZHi3aa	you should really get a third opinion  you shouldnt just side with one|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Get another  opinion from a specialist.

If you truly have high blood pressure, the meds to bring it down are usually dirt cheap and very effective.

You should stretch your ankle regularly.  I would do the ABC's each morning, then take a 20 minute walk.  As your leg gets stronger, you might even want to add ankle weights to your foot while walking.  Don't get discouraged, it took me about 8 months from the time of my injury to now, and I'm almost 100% recovered.  Good Luck, and feel free to send me an email if you want to chat.

Join a gym or do a nightly workout session or a run. Talk about eating healthier instead of dieting. Even if she is a perfect size she could still "tone up" and strengthen her muscles.

Another thing is  she may have got pissed off by that comment but it will by no way of caused anorexia. Anorexia is a big thing and it would take more then one comment to trigger it. so dont feel guilty. By the sounds of her parents saying that she may have got grief at home about her weight?? that can be a trigger. You really need to talk to her. Express your feelings about her making you go on a diet and her now being (too) skinny. If worst comes to the worse talk to her about your fears of her being anorexic. If things progress it may be good to speak to a pastoral/school councellor ect. about what they think you should do. Last resort should be telling her parents because they may take extreme action. Which in the long run may be good but she certainly wont thank you for a while. Just try talking to her first and good luck.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Obviously no one is going to be 100% certain but I have had 3 friends that are girls that were anorexic.

Her parents REALLY aren't helping either....by saying shes good for losing the extra weight that wasn't even there is a definate encouragement on her part, which shouldn't be done!   She doesn't need to stop eating, if she had a bit of a pody stomach (which is natural by the way, not fat, this definately sounds like she has a bit of a disorder) she just needs to do stomach crunches/sit ups to tone her stomach, not starve herself!  If you're not careful she'l turn into a piece of gristle, nd that WON'T be fun to lay in bed with and cuddle will it?   I don't know her personality, maybe if she has a hidden meanstreak or something, but she might be doing it to purposefully hurt you because you jokingly called her fat and she wants to hold a grudge and prove a point shes not.  I don't know what else to offer in the way of advice apart from, good luck!!
zRN6z2ziaa	I would not recommend for anyone to use a douche.  Your vagina has a very delicate balance of yeast and other bacteria, and throwing this out of balance in either direction can cause yeast infections or other bacterial infections of the vagina, cervix, and even the uterus. Another danger of using a douche is that it actually increases your risk of getting PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease), which can lead to infertility in some cases.  Your vagina cleans itself (which is why you often see discharge), and so douching is not generally necessary.  On occasion, doctors will recommend it for certain specific chronic problems, but in general it is not recommended by the medical community.      That being said, if you feel strongly that you want to douche, absolutely do not use a perfumed product, as this can further irritate the vagina.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	It's ok, not too often tho.

I had a UTI and there was no burning or stinging, but after I took my medication, the medication gave me yeast infection down there and that's when I had the stinging and burning.

OHP6Hxz2aa	That happened to me after indoor track last year. you should get on the elliptical for a cardio workout it doesn't hurt your joints or shins. a half hour on the elliptical or more a day  is enough to build up your leg muscle. If you lift then stick to the upper body. Ice your shins after a workout or fill your bathtub with cold water and ice and lay there for an hour. it sounds weird but it works miracles! don't overwork yourself. if you   feel pain stop. My friend did something to her calves while running in indoor track and she ignored the pain so it got so bad she couldn't run for 5 months after it ended and then when she came back to cross country she was out of shape and struggling.  don't push yourself to the point where you won't be able to do anything.

Will it hurt?  Will everyone know?      Sweetie, it's something all women go through and it's is normal for you to be worried about it.  Have you started to go through puberty?  You will be able to tell by the changes in your body when you are getting close to starting.      You will get hair in your pubic area (down there), your breasts will start to grow.  Your breasts might be a little tender while going trough this.     As far as When you will start......no one can help you with that.  It just happens, even as an adult.....I don't know exactly when I will start every month.  My body gives me signs....and so will yours after a while) but I don't know when each month.    Will it hurt?  Well, here again that is different for every person.  I don't get real bad cramps very often.  Sometimes I do.....but it really isn't that bad for me.  My daughter, who is 12, like me sometimes gets cramps but she is able to go on with her normal life...so they aren't that bad for her.  If you do get cramps....get outside and move around.  Believe it or not.......exercising helps the cramps go away.

You may feel embarrassed to talk about these things but, remember there is nothing different about this bodily function than any other. It is part of nature

It is this little bottle of foul tasting liquid and really a waste of money and time because it's just an addicting drug.|`|c20ifVL4aa	Yes its safe I just wouldn't recomend using its every day because it runs your body down.

The dentist will take off the braces and do cleaning and polishing of your teeth to remove the stains of braces. Comparison wise it will be equivalent to filling. After the removal of braces you will need to wear retainers. Retainers are worn to keep your teeth at their new place. It is very important to wear retainers as the perfection achieved in braces treatment can be retained with retainers only. For more information on retainers you can visit the following very informative website <br>  <a href="http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCategories.aspx?ArticleCategoryId=54&Name=Retainers%20after%20Braces" rel="nofollow">http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...</a><br>  They also have the facility of Free Dental Consultation|`|e105cfb2a3df44e1d4835131ebd93824aa	I wouldnt explain it as painful, more a little uncomfortable.

fe53dcc8e9ff4b8d4153869a09c84c91aa	If you're getting breakthrough bleeding at any time other than during the placebo pills, then it generally means that you need a stronger pill. You can actually take any monophasic pill as though it was Seasonale, just keep taking the active pills for three or four packs in a row, so you don't have to lose having fewer periods if you have to switch pill.  I found that I'd get breakthrough bleeding a few months in on several different pills, so had to change.  Went through about 5 or 6 before I found one that worked well, and now I've been on that one for about 8 years.<br>  <br>  Keep taking your pills for now - they are still protecting you against pregnancy.|`|2eb163f1bb41d3ee9d8cf2a8661f6c20aa	I bled the entire 3rd month when I tried them.

This is, of course, using the standard medical idea of a "drop."|`|AA12121778	It depends on substance being dropped.    The density is the easiest part to explain. The higher the density, the more mass you have in the same sized drop. Assuming you're doing this in a gravity environment, more mass means more weight. Which means that for the same sized drop, mercury, which has a much higher density than water, will weigh significantly more, and will therefore have more force pulling it downwards. Mercury has a density of about 13.6 g/cm3, while water has a density of 1 g/cm3.      1 teaspoon = 5 ml     You do the math.|`|21d3fea071ce85b5105f4a6d6909dee3aa	20 drops of water in a teaspoon|`|11bad7d3c2aa5fc9cc8c46bf485e103aaa	One website that sells a product has a listing that 1 teaspoon has 60 drops in it. On another web site it said that 8 drops equals 1 teaspoon. by doing the math  8  drops = 1/8  16 drops =1/4  32 drops = 1/2  therefore 64 drops = 1 teqaspoon  Hope that this helps
d672e2aa80faaa47f2f4d6cdb4860c6caa	I've been wearing contacts for 13 years, and I can tell you, there's no specific way to get them in... it will hurt like crazy the first several times when you put them in or take them out... but eventually you will get so you can do it practically in your sleep. I do have a little advice for you though... hope it helps!    1) wash your hands before putting contacts in/taking them out ... otherwise whatever you've had on your hands gets into your eyes... and having eye infections is much worse & more annoying than having to continuously wash your hands.    2) change your contacts every 30 days - even with washing your hands properly & cleaning your contacts with the solutions, stuff does build up on the contacts over time.    3) don't sleep in your contacts! - take them out before you go to sleep, your eyes need a chance to "breathe" & relax. if you sleep in them, it can damage your eyes (and the eye doctors can tell if you do) and it can make your eyesight worse. Believe me, I found out this lesson the hard way.    4) whenever you're not going to be around anyone, aside of close family/friends (if you're vain about not wearing glasses in front of everyone) keep the contacts out as long as possible - give your eyes a chance to breathe, and get used to the situation of wearing both contacts and glasses|`|4f578252848cae76f12385064b4be34caa	Definitely practice putting them in, they're a bit of a pain and you'll want to wear them for short periods of time and eventually build up to wearing them all day, the eyes usually have to adapt to wearing contacts.   Good eye drops are really useful too. If you've got room carry around a little mirror just in case one folds or moves on your eye.|`|ee1c0c1d4321045630054dc29dc543a6aa	Get some really good eye drop so that your eyes stay moist.  I recommend Sustane.  Also, don't wear any mascara that isn't waterproof for the first couple of months.  That way the mascara won't get in your eyes if you rub them.  Same goes for the eyeshadows, the liquid ones are safer than the powders.|`|da30f0e2ca932c8b2b71fe38507f4fdbaa	I have very bad eyesight also. I didn't really have any problems putting them in, but have some friends that just couldn't get the hang of it. I use one hand to hold the top of my eyelid up and the bottom eyelid down. Most people just hold either the top up or the bottom down instead of both. I can tell you...do not get in the habit of sleeping in them!! I got in this habit and did it for years. Finally it caught up to me. A few months ago I woke up and couldn't open my eyes. They were suffering from lack of oxygen! I couldn't drive or sit in any light or anything for 3 or 4 days!! Clean them EVERY DAY and DON"T sleep in them!! Good luck!|`|e74f191357ce5a02aa12c5ecc2109e48aa	Learning how to put in contacts was really hard for me.  Supposedly , it's easier for girls because they are more used to touching their faces (makeup, etc.).  Remember to keep BOTH eyes open when putting them in.  Also, don't put it in backwards; it the edges will hurt.|`|3ca8176ba9242227fec2aefbc295b6f5aa	I've been wearing contacts for 3 years now. I'm near-sighted as well (can't see far away). At first, it's very frustrating to get in because they just don't want to stay on your eye. It will be hard at first to touch your eye as well. Just make sure your contact and finger isn't dry when you try putting them in. This makes it scratchy and uncomfortable. If you're putting on makeup, put your contacts in FIRST! This is to make sure that no fibres or debris get in your eye. Good luck!    P.S: Avoid the "Renu" brand of contact solution at all costs! They  have done studies, and it showed that this brand causes some weird eye fungus that is very dangerous.|`|AA11865230	be careful with contacts and ther eis a special way to put them on because there is a right side and a wrong side ... besides if your eyes go red and if its too painful it means ur eyes cant handle it ! there are people that can put contacts and people that cant wear them !!  make sure that ur hands are CLEAN when ur touching them to put them on... whenever you take them out put new liquid every time... always put liquid coz if you dont they will dry out! they r super sensitive and so are ur eyes so pls be cautious!! the right side of the contacts is the side that easily bends and it touches the other side ... the wrong side of contact doesnt easily bend, wherever ull go buy them ask him all questions ... and im sure he will show you what i mean :) i told you all i know :)
AA12146043	Yes those are both fine you should just watch the sugar intake from both products. Tea itself is good for you and has many healing qualities. Yes there is caffeine in tea but not as much as one might think. I am from the south and grew up on sweet tea and trust me a cup of coffee has way more caffeine. Have you ever tried just adding a little lemon juice to some water for flavor. Not fake stuff...the real thing...or any other juice for that matter? Its actually really good. I do that myself. Just squeeze a lil lemon juice in some water.|`|0e37d369d74e5bf3106596e07f86908eaa	Not at all .Additives just enhance the taste.|`|aec5cbf9765ad0a59b0207aa3f716e6baa	Your kidneys and liver process the things that come into your body, and purify it through your blood and vile, etc.  The more you add to things, the harder your body has to work.

Very interesting, entertaining, and informative.|`|AA11409431	Tea and Crystal Light are perfectly harmless.  Just beware of the side effects of too much caffiene or artificial sweeteners.

I know that people use sugar substitutes like sweet&low and nutrasweet to stay healthy so iwould suggest tea has a positive benefit its the sugar you should be weary about|`|dbffb66d7b5485511bd370ef31eb72d2aa	Drinking water with additive will help a person replenish the water in their body,but things like sugars will dehydrate the body. As far as tea: Some teas are good for you but, Tea has caffine and will cause sist in some people, mostly in women in the breast which can be painful and mistaken for cancer.

As far as the disposible kind, the pluses are that you can wear it anytime, you can wear it longer and the risk for TSS is lower, plus you can have sex during your period without the mess. The downside is removing it can be messy. You have to reach up and hook it with your finger to pull it out and it spills sometimes. Personally to me the messy removal is nothing compared to being able to go swimming with my family and not have to deal with pads or tampons feeling like they are going to fall out or even loosing out on sex!!    Feel free to message me if you have any questions!|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	You might not be putting in the tampon at the correct angle.   Put some vasoline on the end of the tampon  , sit on the toilet.  Lean forward a bit while you insert it. think about putting it in pointing to your bellie button.

Dhz4XgQ3aa	Hey honey    I am so sorry about your job.  I think you might be a bit depressed. Can you go see your doctor anyway? S/he can help you, and antidepressants might lift you enough for you to deal with it a bit better.     Can you start to look now for a new job? Legal is quite a specialist field so if you have experience you might find it easier to get a new job then you expect.   What about registering with some agencies straight away?    Please go see your doctor though, as your mental health is crucial for you to be able to move into another role and this needs to addressed by your doctor honey!!!     Antidepressants can take 2-3 weeks to take effect. It is also possible it could take a couple of goes for you to find the right ones for you.     Make sure your drinking if your not eating much, keep yourself drink water etc. Loss of apetite is a major symptom of depression. Try to eat what you can, if you have lost weight then just eat what you fanci to get you eating again. If it means you eats chips/fries for a couple days then so be it at least your be eating.     Lots of love xxx|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Redundancy can take a heavy toll on some people, it is normal. I remember in the last recession my father (a civil engineer) had no work for almost a year and he battled with depression as a result. It is frightening having no income and being rejected for available job vacancies can leave one feeling unwanted and useless. His doctor advised him to get up every day just as he would normally and get out there doing any work, paid or voluntary that he could find. He ended up doing door to door market research for 6 months. He met some really interesting people (and some miserable buggers) kept up his routine, earned a little money and kept his state of mind on a more even keel because he was busy. You will find another job, it may take some time but things will improve. There are so many people worldwide in this situation right now.     Try offering to work on a volunteer basis in another law firm, or even your own, just to keep up with the world. I'm in my mid 40s, I've seen 2 recessions, I've been made redundant 3 times and I do understand where you're coming from but you have to keep going, remember; even if it's a rubbish job - it's a job - take it just to tide you over.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	being out of a job ain't much fun.  i can guarantee that.     what you do need to do is look for another.  keep in mind, searching for a job is a full time job in itself.  think of it as working for the most demanding employer you'll ever have -- yourself.  and your pay will be a new, and better, job.    it is a crummy economy, and jobs aren't going to come looking for you.  you will have to work to find a good one.  i'd look on craigslist to see what's available.  i'd write a resume.  i'd rewrite it, to make it match what's requested for every job you think you might want.  i'd talk to folks who liked your work, and ask them if they'd be references.    i remember talking with my mom.  she, correctly, thought that companies would be lucky to get her.  one time, if i remember correctly, she had 3 offers, and got to choose.  these times are probably not as good.  but people are working, and hiring.  just make sure you're worth hiring.    keep in mind, while hunting for a job, you're working for you.  being sad is normal -- particularly when you like the people and job.   but you're not the only one, and it will get better.  maybe there's something that you've thought you'd like to try.  now's a good time.     good luck.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	Hi.  It is perfectly understandable that you feel down about this.  You are grieving the loss of a part of your life you love, so don't be too hard on yourself.  Try and start looking for somethingelse now,that will give you some focus.  Remember, when one door closes, another one opens.  Try and talk to people about how you feel as well, particularly your work colleagues.  You may find it helps to talk to people who are in the same boat.  Good luck. And don't be hard on yourself. x|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I think you need to toughen up or you'll find you are too depressed to get another job.

I'm very prone to depression and have been treated for it in the past.  I recently found out that one my friends who is also a coworker has been diagnosed with ALS  "Lou Gehrig Disease".  My friend is only 30 years old and he was a picture of good health.  He is finishing his PHD in public health.  All it was is that his hand has been trembling and feeling a little week. If you're not familiar with this disease, please look it up.  It's basically a death sentence.  Since this happened, every time I get depressed all I say to my self is thank god I'm not dying of a horrible disease and I really need to enjoy and cherish every day that goes by.  I'm  not telling you that you shouldn't be depressed or upset about your job, I'm just saying that it could be A LOT worse.  Find the strength within you to go on and remind yourself that that's the way life is, it has it's ups and downs. You're still very young and you have your whole life ahead of you.  I'm sure you'll find another job one day and all this will be behind you.    I hope I've helped just a little.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Hi Claire, ignore the judgemental people on hear who jump to conclusions when they know little about you.  Of course you have a right to be upset, anyone would be if they were in your position.  Its natural.  I know its hard but try and look at the positives.  You now have a chance to move on, possibly to a better job and you'll get to meet new people.  If you're feeling down and struggling surround yourself with people you love and who make you happy.  Pamper yourself.  Apply for lots of potential jobs asap.  You will feel less anxious if you know that you have another job to go to.  Even if it's not your ideal job, you could always apply for something that's more suited to you as and when they come up.  Good luck!|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	I would think this is just a normal depression ,you have had some bad news so naturally will feel down about it.It is too early to worry about your mental health unless you have had these episodes before for no particular reason. Try and talk to someone about how you are feeling ,it helps to get it out and share with someone.

DIvuSSlZaa	<br>  Antibiotics stay in your system for 10 days to 2 weeks, so I think the tooth might continue to improve even when you finish the tablets (but I'm def NOT a doctor). <br>  <br>  Dentists never take out teeth that can be saved, cos you need them for life. Just be honest and tell the dentist that it has improved and take it from there.<br>  <br>  Also, the reason they put temporary filling in is so that if the root canal isn't good and there's still infection, they can go beck in and get rid of it. Hopefully she can just do that if the infection really won't go away.<br>  <br>  I think there's still hope for your tooth. Good luck with it and your baby! :)<br>  |`|w8WV2tlGaa	Well as long as you haven't been taking additional painkillers that could be responsible for the improvement, i'd say its a good sign. The original infection sounds like a bad one and hopefully this is why the antibiotics took so long to work. As long as it keeps on improving I can't see why she won't let nature take its course. Good luck and be truthful with the dentist on how you feel on the day or you will be back in even futher agony!

xKYXurpNaa	Liver cleanses are safe to do, and usually involve taking supplements.  The most common liver cleansing supplement is called milk thistle which is an herb.    Drink lots of water and refrain from anything which is hard on the liver such as tylenol and alcohol and also avoid fructose to give the liver a rest because it's metabolized in the liver.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	If you want to do a liver cleanse I would suggest you contact herbs hands healing who do kits and can also advise you personally on whether it is right for you.

	You need to continue working out but you also need to eat lots. At your age, you probably won't get fat and you won't build muscle without plenty of food. I'm guessing you have a high metabolism and I'm also guessing that you don't eat too much which is why you're thin. If you don't have much time then you could easily add plenty protein and calories to your diet by drinking milk. Drink 2 liters per day and you'll fill out nicely.    You need to include heavy, basic lifts in your training. That means squats, pull ups, bench press, etc. I'd recommend working out 5 times a week doing legs one day, chest and triceps the next and back and biceps the next. Then just repeat, starting with legs again. Remember that the heavy, basic lifts should be done first in the workout and are ultimately what will put some muscle on you.     One last point is to lay off the cardio if you're already doing that. You don't want to be burning calories running since this will offset your gains in the gym. Cardio is good for getting thin, not for building muscle. All the best!|`|	Resistance training|`|	Lift harder, take in more protein. Eat more calories. Try to reach atleats 2500 calories a day. If you'r ethin already then you have a fast metabolism and all the bad caloires will burn away anyways.    I suggest taking supplements    M-drol from CEL will put on 15 pounds of muscle in about 6 weeks and only costs 25$ on TFSUPPLEMNTS.com    Superpump250 is a great product to use before wokring out. 39$ on bodybuilding.com    Both fo those togetehr for a month and tsraight weaight liftign 5-6 days a weeks with a high caloire sintake and protein shakes will put on 20 pounds with out a problem.

d6efac62c0aae4f4f91a601b45493d95aa	You shouldn't feel lame for not loosing your virginity yet. Loosing your virginity is a big deal for a girl and it shouldn't be done because all your friends have done it. I wish I would of followed this advice myself at your age. I see now that I should of waited, having sex should be with someone you love and care about and want to spend the rest of your life with. If you choose to wait you will have more respect for yourself later in life and so will others. Especially guys, if it is something you just give away more than likely your relationship won't have trust and your guy won't trust you. If I were you I would wait until you are ready, don't do it just because all your friends have. Your not lame for this and don't listen to what your friends say. Follow what you believe. Remember its not a race to get there first, its suppose to be something special between two people, which seems to have been forgotten.|`|b7a82b901fcc99256cf38a069c10d181aa	You're not lame, you're smarter than your friends.  There is no specific age to lose your virginity, but 15 seems too young to me.  Never do anything just because your friends or "everybody else" is doing it.  You are you and you are special.  Lose your virginity to somebody you love and somebody who loves you deeply.  It may be in a few years, who knows.  I waited until marriage so I've only made love to my husband, and it's wonderful.  I know many people prefer not to wait until marriage, so at least be in a steady, commited relationship and think about the consequences of having sex.  Good luck!|`|AA12169153	im 15 too. but u kno, those ppl are either desperate, or out of their mind, im sorry. juss do wat is comfortable for u!|`|584fb35579c9a1168fd5241d0be362daaa	dont be. when your ready your ready. who cares if every one else had sex before you. its fine. dont worry about it hun. and dont feel lame.|`|ba2d632a3ae826f6a7d5385da46ed5efaa	I'm 15 too and you shouldn't feel bad that you haven't lost your virginity.

t15OTc4Maa	No, one important thing I have learnt is not WHEN you eat something in the space of 24hours but HOW much of it you eat and WHAT you eat.     At the end of the day, the calories count up to the same number. Although, having small meals at different times along the day helps increase metabolism.|`|xKYXurpNaa	Depends TOTALLY on how many calories you have eaten so far during the day.    If you consume more calories than you burn, you will gain weight,     END OF STORY|`|YgVtCX3raa	Its best not 2 eat 2 hours before going to bed.|`|nwcJI64naa	The bottom line is that your body burns calories throughout the day. When you go to bed, your body isn't active so it won't burn calories. This means it's best to only eat before 6 PM in most cases.    Even eating a meal before taking a nap can increase the weight gained from food. : )|`|RkHmXky2aa	thats just a rumour. There's no real effect, just how much you eat during the whole day counts.|`|AA11263029	depends on what you eat.  eat cereal for dinner and you heavier foods for breakfast i did for a year and lost 30 pounds|`|OR5PhU40aa	Eating any time of day will make you gain weight, but because your metabolism starts up in the morning, it's at its fastest then. This, in turn, will cause it to become slower in the evening -- so, yes, you will gain more weight eating in the evening than you would in the morning, but it's nothing too significant, unless you're binging on junk food at night (an activity one should reserve for parties).

And each time she has you do something different...so it isn't boring.   All you need are hand weights.  She is pretty tough.  There are three levels of intensity and I'm still struggling through the first level because its pretty tough.

aiBOMU9kaa	20/40 or 20/50 isn't all that serious, so of course you can still see, but you would see even clearer if that was corrected with glasses.

If you start driving you will need to wear corrective lenses.  I think you probably have a high tolerance for blur.  If you get the eyeglasses, you do not have to wear them all the time.  You can wear as needed for clear distance vision.    My left eye has 20/50 vision and my right eye has 20/20 vision.  I really notice the difference because I can compare them at the same time.  Here are a few things that I notice when doing common activities that require distance vision.      1) Reading a board in class from a distance.  If the writing is large, I can usually tell what it says but the edges are fuzzy and unclear.  If the writing is small my left eye can tell it is text, but that's about it.  If I am in a larger college lecture hall, then my left eye can't read most of the text on the display.    2) Watching TV or playing videos games.  I have a 32 widescreen LCD TV and I sit about 8 feet away from it.  I play several text intensive video games (RPG) and my left eye usually can't read most of the text in the games unless I am really close to the TV.  The text I can read is blurry and I have trouble distinguishing some of the detail.  I also watch lots of subtitled programs and my left eye can barely read the subtitles.    3) Driving, I notice the most difference here.  My left eye has trouble reading the street signs especially the smaller ones.  I usually have to be in the middle of the intersection before I can read the sign at the corner of the street.  I can read the large street signs, but they are not as detailed as they should be.  If I drove at night the street lights and headlights have star burst effect    I choose to wear my eyeglasses/contact lens when driving even though my license does not have a corrective lens restriction because my right eye has normal vision.  I prefer having a full and clear picture of the road.    If you experience some of the issues I described above, then please have an eye exam, get the eyeglasses and see how it goes.  You should have something to compare to when making a decision on this.  You do not have to wear them all the time and contact lenses may be an option for you as well.  Please have an eye exam.

AA11918110	Don't be fooled into thinking that muscle is a bad thing. What do you think burns all the calories we intake everyday. Just set yourself to a certain # of reps and keep doing the cardiovascular workout and also limit yourself to the amount of weight you are trying to lift, and that will keep you tone and fit. These are the key words, Tone and Fit rather than just thinking of it as skinny. Oh one other thing, don't over do it either, you only have to work out 3 times a week. But if it's skinny that you are after, then you are only wasting your money at a gym and you would be better off just starving yourself like some of the models out there.|`|k5NqWFNkaa	Muscle burns fat.

I worked off twenty five pounds, it really does work!|`|woWBWZEpaa	umm i believe that carbs break down fuels, i dont know much about that. Protein is necessary for the building and repair of body tissues.    It produces enzymes, hormones, and other substances the body uses.   It regulates body processes, such as water balancing, transporting nutrients, and making muscles contract.   Protein keeps the body healthy by resisting diseases that are common to malnourished people.   Prevents one from becoming easily fatigued by producing stamina and energy.    Fats do not do anyhting for your body. All they do is give you bad health and make you fat. But if you are slimer then you need to be fats are good for you. they do a lot a things to your body first they make you fat and second build up cells in your body that are called fat cells Exercise   Fats insulate your body and internal organs from heat/cold and provides a 'cushion' for them. Without it, our bodies would be dangerously prone to temperature changes and injuries, but too much fat causes many diseases so try to keep your fat level in check.|`|iCc0Dwaoaa	Carbs are for carbo-loading    Protein gives you jacked fibraz.

Problems associated with inhaling any type of smoke are to be kept in mind. Asthma for example. Weed can cause this to act up when smoking. If you are new to smoking weed and you cough a lot, you may feel pain in your chest. If this happens over a long period of time you can scar your lungs. Risk vs. Reward. I'm not trying to scare you, but just be mindful of things like that. Don't let anyone tell you that weed is not addictive. It has some very addictive properties, withdrawal sucks!

You can always choose how much weight to lift, and it will make you stronger.  You can gain endurance muscle by doing a lot of reps with less weight or heavy lifting muscle with more weight and less reps.  You will probably want to do squats and lunges the most, but calf presses and leg extensions will help too.  You can do squats by getting a bar with however much weight you want on the ends and squating until your knee bends at about 90 degrees.  You probably don't want to put more than 45 pound weights on each end of the bar.  You do lunges by stepping one foota few feet in front of the other and slowly lowering the knee of your back leg to the ground and keeping as much weight on the front foot.  These will increase your hamstring and quad muscles.  You need to eat a lot of protein through the day, right before you work out, and right after.  That will help you gain a lot of muscle.  Don't work the same muscle groups 2 days in a row, because you tear your muscles when you work out and they need about 2 days to heal.  There are all kinds of other exercises you can do, but those are the best leg strengthening exercises.|`|41b7123f68598b37f8b7f5658fb5da9baa	Well, teenagers usually love to dance.

6y29MTyyaa	Your septum (the barrier between your nostrils) is probably crooked.  Most are; a perfectly straight one is a medical curiosity.  When you lie down, the extra blood in your head can cause minor nasal congestion by making insides of your nose swell; this is very common (as an aside, it's a 24-7 thing to astronauts living in zero-G environments).<br>  <br>  In other words, your crooked septum makes your nasal passage narrow, and the congestion from lying down does the rest.  When you stand up, the blood drains from your nose, and you clear up.  This is why I suspect the septum over mucus (which is where others suggest nasal irrigation)<br>  <br>  It's not always the same nostril because it might be the cartilage part of the septum (not the bone) that's crooked.  This can cause it to snap back and forth like a hairpin.<br>  <br>  Your main concerns are tooth decay due to dry mouth (if someone observes you breathing through your mouth while you sleep), and maybe a susceptibility to sinus infections.  That said -- assuming you're an adult -- if you don't have a history of either by now, this isn't something to get surgically repaired.|`|UtWeIdOvaa	Your sinus juice (snot) is moving to the nostril facing the pillow cause of gravity.

Honestly, most people expect to see someone w/ a little hair, it's normal, and it surely doesn't take away from your looks.<br>    By using waxes, etc, you may actually make your back look worse (burns, blotches, etc) thus, making it look like your hair is so noticeable.<br>    If you are that worried about it, you should ask opinions from people you are comfortable with that will tell you the truth if it is so noticeable.<br>    Or, for the big time, electrolysis, or lazer surgery of a sort.|`|XkgWlYvVaa	You can try laser treatment if you are that unhappy.

8IfePMa3aa	Very few piercers numb it and for good reason. While it'll numb the outer skin, it's not going to numb the middle, making it worthless. The piercing itself is just like any other piercing, it's the healing that sucks. |`|e71831fdce6861be979952436c98b8a2aa	No, they don't numb it.

They give you a cup of mouthwash to sanatize your mouth.<br>  <br>  On a scale of 1-10 I would say it is a 2.  The intial piercing happens so quickly you can hardly feel it.  It's the part after when they are tightening the balls that pinches a little.|`|NjiZvPKLaa	3 of my friends have got it done, they said it was fine, just hurt a bit afterward when eating and drinking but that went after a couple of days.<br>  Not sure about the numbing thing though.|`|PU5Qq1bIaa	No; they are not going to numb it.  It's just a pinch; suck it up if you really want it done.

Pjm9pg7iaa	You have to watch the tv show Mystery Diagnosis on Discovery Health channel.  You have to do some detective work to figure this out. What happens if you exercise hard when the pain starts.  Does it get better or worse if you eat something.  How about if you immediately drink something.  Is it better or worse when you wake up in the morning. Just before bed. Does it change when you worry.  If you read a book of jokes, does laughing make it better or worse. You can zero in on this problem. Read more at www.webmd.com and www.medlineplus.com|`|iN0cyZoTaa	I hope I can help you. I also have acid reflux. The first thing I'll mention to you is that you can google acid/alkaline diet and get some information from there as to what you should be eating. That's the whole key to getting better. You need to be eating alkaline forming foods, and not acid forming foods. Believe me it will make a huge difference. I thought I was going to die before I found my own answers because the doctors didn't help me much at all. Mainly you should be eating fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Like whole grain pasta, bread, tortillas. Honey and soy products are ok. Citrus fruit is good too. Always add a little lemon to your water. That will make it more alkaline. Otherwise just plain water is acidic in your system. Stay away from meat, poultry, milk, eggs, tea, coffee, eggs, sodas, alcohol, and the list goes on. Most foods are acid forming unfortunately.Watch out about taking too many tums. It neutralizes the acid in the beginning but then it causes your body to produce more acid. Like a rebound effect. If you could get the book Prescription for Nutritional Healing by James and Phyllis Balch. That book saved my life. Look under acidosis. Also get the ph papers if you can. That way you can test to see when your body is in the proper ph balance. I can now eat pretty much anything but I still have to keep lemon in my water to keep the acid down. Hope I could help you out a bit. Good luck to you. |`|810KsQ7vaa	I went around and around with doctors for 25 years. I am 43. I finally gave up. Gastroenterology will rapidly become history when this finally comes out. The profession is sucking wind at curing you I see. I got the genetic test and ignored the doctors that insisted I didn't know what I am talking about. Fortunately for you and me, my pops was The senior Pharmaceutical lobbyist at Roche. I also am autistic. But no longer. I am treated with the diet I knew the moron doctors said was a fad. Try my trail to holistic enlightenment. These ARE the guys brought to this country, USA to train our doctors. You now have the opportunity to diagnose this yourself with the only 100 percent accurate test. Endoscopic biopsies and blood tests all failed me. I read the effectiveness of the american tests @ Cambridge done by the two doctors. It was less than 60 percent accurate and is unbelievably costly. Genetic testing is 100 %. It cost 149 now and you can do it at home and get results in like two weeks. It is just like on Maury, the cotton swab in the mouth thing.It is genetic. It is science. Gastro enterology is a bunch of money grubbing witch doctors. Get yourself a good naturopathic physician. They are covered on YOUR health plan now. Why, because they deny what celiacs is. My doctor was so pissed at yale newhaven head of gastro through my results at me and said here, so what. your a celiac. Go gluten free and call me in a year. The head of yale gastro. My father called on yale back when he was just a rep. anyway... google the following and order the test that is availble that identifies the markers. HLA DQ1 through DQ9 DQ2 and DQ8 are the most importent. I am Dq8 4 and 5. Yes you weenies, I am hybrid! I also hold A24. This is highest evolution. This malfunction runs in only the systemic and succesful. This is a lie, It runs in everyone.

What is the current propensity? You do the math.|`|SCJVE0gTaa	Perhaps you are obese? If you are, the fat over the esophagus and stomach pushes up the acid causing heart burn.

yD32TDDoaa	Sounds like you have a virus.  Not surprising they are going around a lot lately, hey its winter.  Just eat as much as your body will let you and take a multivitamin. Also drink a lot of water.  Sometimes when your body is used to throwing up from being sick it takes a little while to bounce back to normal.  It goes into starvation mode and tries to preserve the fat and protein stores as much as possible and binge eating will just make you feel sicker.  Try eating high caloric snacks in between like macadamia nuts or cashews so you get a good source of protein.  Make the most of the amount your body will agree with until your full appetite comes back.  Your body knows how much it needs you don't need to stuff it or worry about becoming an emaciated skinny little thing unless this goes on for more than a few more weeks and you lose more than 5% of your body weight.|`|rcqi6sSfaa	I had same problem    it takes a while to regain all your strentgh    your body won.t accept a lot of food    give it a bout 5 days to 2 weeks    if it.s not better in a few weeks talk to ur doctor    try gradually working on eating more food but don.t force urself to eat a lot of food    =D|`|Kp2nGNwzaa	its just that your body needs to recover for a couple more days after getting sick.it happend to my sister and now shes fine. just wait untill your body can handle a lot of food|`|KkKCKu06aa	You may just be going through a growth spurt. or you're stressed. just relax and eat when you feel the need to. even if it's a cracker here, or a sandwhich there.|`|sfl63QxAaa	Loss of appetite is a symptom of the flu and other minor sicknesses.

Good luck!|`|AA11172209	chek it out w a doc|`|gjeOKI52aa	This could be because when you were throwing up you didn't eat as much. Your stomach may have shrank or your body became accustomed to eating very little. I've experienced this numerous times but return to normal after a week or two. If it has only been a few days I'd say give it more time or if the problem is big for you, seek a doctor's opinion.|`|4ZktwobSaa	no your not sick..it's just a phase your going through..  i know it from my friend..she felt just like you..but now theres nothing she's just fine :D|`|2si53dCRaa	Sometimes after i'm sick and have been throwing up a lot I can't eat that much either.

Therefore, your stomach will shrink.    (That is how people get fat. They eat a lot, then their stomach expands, and then whenever they eat, they need to fill their bigger stomach.)    Just push yourself to eat more when you're eating. (not to the point of throwing up, though)    Then, your stomach will expand back to its normal size and everything will be back to normal again.
gL1sdmV1aa	Possibly a kidney stone.  Also, there is a condition called 'urethral stricture'  Basically, the urethra gets damaged (from std, accident, kidney stone, etc) and scar tissue begins to restrict the pipe.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of urethral stricture are a sensation of needing to pee and not really having to, slow stream, and a burning sensation at the tip of the um, pipe.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, these same symptoms can indicate stones, prostate problems, and so on.<br>  <br>  It is likely unrelated to your nut crush incident.  None of that 'plumbing' goes through the scrotum.<br>  <br>  Get to the urologist and let him take a look.  Be prepared to expose yourself to him, and probably even take a pee with the doctor watching.  Worst case they may wanna take a look 'up the pipe' with a camera.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.
CyYAl3Mzaa	You need to have it checked out. If it is broken and not tended to it could possibly cause an infection in the bone. Believe me, that is not fun. I'm not trying to scare you but I had a patient who broke his foot high near the ankle and didn't have it checked for two months. He struggled with trying to get the bone infection cleared up for almost two years and ended up having to have his foot amputated. He now has a prosthetic and you can't tell he has any problems but if he had gone to the doctor/urgent care/ER sooner he could have avoided several surgeries and the amputation.<br>  <br>  For more info on foot injuries visit webmd.com or mayoclinic.com  Both have symptom checker and gives info in language that non medical persons can understand.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

UZxeBrxQaa	A "Brain Attack" is similar to a heart attack in many ways, except the outcome can be debilitating in a different way, and recovery time is measure in months, perhaps a year, or even longer.<br>  <br>  When the brain is deprived of blood, which is one kind of stroke, connections, cells, brain chemicals, can get pretty messed up.  It takes time for them to recover.  Sometimes the patient has to learn to use other parts of her brain to do some functions, such as walk, talk, reason, remember...and this is going to take a lot of patience on the victim's part, and especially in those who must support her in her journey of recovery.<br>  <br>  Don't expect too much, too quickly.  The depression medication alone can take up to 4 to 6 weeks to restore proper serotonin balance and re-uptake in her brain.  This is just one fight she faces.  You need to be strong for her, and brave.  She won't remember a lot of things, and may call you by a different name because her memories are jumbled.  Don't let this scare you!  <br>  <br>  Your depression is called "Situational Depression".  Its temporary and can be caused by a tragic event in life.  What you are going through, at your young age, is scary.<br>  <br>  Hang in there.  Time will help this to resolve.  If your depression continues, tell the doctor about it.  The last thing you need is a bout of depression  with everything else you have going on in your life.<br>  <br>  I love you, and will send "Good Vibrations" in your mothers direction, and a bunch of hugs towards yours!!!|`|knjR9BjZaa	I'm really sorry that sounds like a terrible situation.

Good luck I really hope you get the answer you're looking for |`|7pshFngLaa	I am so sorry for your situation. I will pray for both of you daily!<br>  Take care honey :) She will get better. Have faith, and don't lose hope.|`|KbBFugvFaa	Having a stroke is scary for the person who has the stroke as  well as for you. There is no quick fix for a stroke victim . Your patience and understanding is going a long way to help your mother. Remember she is aware in her mind what she wants to do and say but the brain is not yet capable of sending out the messages. ie. You are sitting at a table ready to eat, your brain sends signals pick up the fork pick up the food chew swallow etc.Depending on how severe your mothers stoke may have been she may know she is hungry and knows she wants to pick up the fork but the brain can't send the message to pick up the fork etc This is most frustrating for the patient and it is quite normal that they have depression. Her neurologist, physical therapist/occupational therapist are  all there to help your mother. Be strong for your mother, patience and encouraging words  go a long way in her recovery and yes we will pray with you. God speed be with you!

h8ZRUUNnaa	yeah, Ok ur teacher should actually explain this concept a little more..ur body burns around 2000-2500 calories a day on its own without exercise, so u either should be consuming 2000 calories a day to maintain ur weight or reduce calorie intake 500 calories to create a deficit in ur intake so u burn 3500 cal which equal 1 pound.<br>  Your eating too little, u should intake atleast 1200 calories a day..ur just putting ur body in starvation mode. Everyone BMR rate is different it depends on many factors like height, weight, build, etc.<br>  <br>  The second question, yeah Biologe is very good|`|oJQ1r4FGaa	k here's the deal...its part true...yet not...<br>  your body doesnt use ALL the calories that you take in...so u have to make sure you work off the ones that u dont NEED...so yes it is impossible bc ur body needs calories to function|`|jwUVZz7Naa	i'm not sure about the first question..<br>  but the second i am an expert! BIOLAGE FOR SURE ;)
PhLAsaRkaa	This pain is usually called a stitch. It is just a pain you get when you run harder than your body is used to. Just take the pain for a little while, and eventually your runs will get easier.|`|gg4Q0D9xaa	your body isnt use to it yet, endure the pain and soon you won't feel it at all.
fsEr4x6oaa	Eat bananas, you need the potassium to help your muscles get rid of the lactic acid built up from the workout. You will still be sore but it will get better as your body get used to the workouts (getting healthy).|`|kD9576LTaa	ohhh man. im going thru the same thing right now? i took up an extra gym class, im seriously getting my butt kicked lol stretch as much as you can. it hepls alot, and control your breathing when you stretch. makes it feel better|`|5aBVt8ikaa	You need to stretch and rest. Continue the workouts as planned. The soreness will soon go away as time goes by. 
N2JkgQ4Uaa	period is when your body clears the lining of the womb so you're ready to have a baby.<br>  <br>  Some periods (Especially my first) where very heavy, and it is perfectly normal to lose a lot of blood in the first few times, and you may get awful stomach cramps, <br>  <br>  Have you considered using a tampon? they are really good because then you don't feel as icky. It takes a little bit of pratice getting one in but once you got it, you got it.<br>  <br>  It isn't uncommon for blood to be "Red" when on a period because it is "Fresh" blood sometimes, but it will go a brownish color  later.<br>  <br>  Any other questions PM me ^_^|`|d89qNyb6aa	Don't worry you'll be fine. Get pads that say on the packed heavy flow.It won't be as heavy in a day or two.Take it easy for a few days and tell your mum that you have a heavy period.You don't have to say it's you 1st one just say you feel a bit off because it's so heavy.Rest with a good film and chocolates.<br>  I hope you're feeling better soon.
wc5vJWlZaa	This book has information on how to naturally boost your testosterone levels and to build the most important part of your body...highly recommended: <a href="http://www.mistermanpower.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.mistermanpower.net</a>
Ugw1nNxxaa	I am not sure it is a sleep disorder.  Some people simply sleep heavier than others and can screen out the noise.  It also makes a difference what stage of sleep you are in when you wake up.  You are getting enough sleep for sure...maybe even too much, but you say it makes no difference.<br>  <br>  We all eventually develop a sleep pattern, but right now yours seems to be erratic.  I would talk to my doctor about what is happening and see if he thinks you need to see a sleep specialist.
iMpIN29Saa	the exact same thing happens to me!!! my hands and feet are always cold.  sometimes so cold they turn purple.  i asked the trainer at school(he helps with injuries. i almost got a concussion at school so i had to go see him).  they think that it might be bad circulation.  i just use handwarmers and feetwarmers.  good luck. if you figure out what it is email me please!!<br>  i hope this helps a little bit. |`|A2OQt0kVaa	Lay off the speed.|`|v8TI8Cn2aa	ur dying|`|jphIGLvLaa	Probably is just the cold... What you could try is boiling some water and pouring it into a mug (or making a cup of tea/coffee) and holding it with your hands wrapped around it for 15-20 minutes. Once they're warm, keep them warm with gloves etc. <br>  <br>  If you absolutely can't get them warm and they start going blue or purple, go to the doctor - see what he can do...<br>  <br>  Good luck... Hope this helps.|`|KmhraWKvaa	air conditioning?.. you should use some hand warmers... and feet warmers.. i uesd them skiing
9pLdhuBnaa	You could have an irritated nerve going in that area of your neck (an example only).<br>  <br>  One thing you could try for the area is like a heating pad to see if that helps some of the pain.<br>  <br>  If it is still not better by tomorrow I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.<br>  <br>  Even before that though let your parents know what's going so that they can help keep an eye on the situation (if under age).
YupMCYHlaa	You shouldnt be -scared-.  You should be -concerned-.  As you are.<br>  <br>  Based on your blood sugar numbers, I'd say you were doing pretty well.  But for the rest of your life you will be either pre-diabetic, or diabetic.  So it's a matter of making the right habits.<br>  <br>  As I understand it, there is no evidence that keeping your blood sugar under tight control will prevent you from becoming diabetic.  It's a time bomb set inside your body.  But lots of people think it might help, and it certainly can't hurt.  Exercise is also very important.<br>  <br>  At the very least, keeping your blood sugar under control will mean you won't do a lot of damage to yourself if you do become diabetic.  Most people, once they are diagnosed, have been diabetic for years and have already caused damage.  So you're lucky to know you have the possibility of becoming diabetic.<br>  <br>  Anyway it sounds like you're doing a good job.  Keep it up!  Best of luck!|`|6a425ca0206ca2d39f255ee40c811f44aa	That depends - would you mind losing your legs or going blind? <br>  Yes you should be scared.|`|OcfUTWataa	Yes, you should be scared.  People who are conscientious about taking care of themselves live a normal lifetime (look up Mary Tyler Moore, who was famous int 70's).  She is an exception though.  Most people have serious side effects of diabetes:  due to poor blood circulation, a cut on a toe can get infected and eventually the toe, or part of the foot, has to be amputated.  Diabetes can cause blood vessels in the eye to bleed, which results in many laser-surgeries which only delay the onset of blindness. <br>  Diabetics have a constant, never-ending need to check blood sugar multiple times per day, and the cost of prescription drugs and blood testing supplies is high, even if you're only paying deductibles.  It's far, far better to lose weight, eat right and prevent this disease from starting. |`|da8d3fa7a075907fff1a655c9a107079aa	Yes..be healthily scared.<br>  Do everything you can to help yourself avoid getting diabetes.<br>  I had it during pregnancy and had ti inject 4 times a day..not nice.<br>  But worse still, my poor Nan had diabetes and had to have both legs amputated due it!!!|`|XKVKDp53aa	no you don't need to be scared i have diabetes and i watch what i eat and try to live each day like i didn't have diabetes i don't let get to me

Gnfc4wRlaa	I know from one of your previous questions that you are depressed about something, but you didn't really give any information about it.  You need to talk to someone, your parents the school counselor, or someone you can trust.  You should not make such a decision while a situation is going on.  You need to give it some time and you will find that you don't really want to end your life.  Many people feel at some point that they just want to escape the situation and they consider suicide.  Thinking back on it, they are usually glad they didn't.  As long as you put off the decision, you always have the option to do it later.  Once you have done it, you don't have the option to change your mind.  In fact, you don't have any options then.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Immediately click onto this site http://www.metanoia.org./suicide/ This was written by someone who was planning on suicide.

scTpO8Enaa	It could be an ingrown hair, a hair follicle or, just as you've said, a pimple.  I sometimes get these too and after a while they have gone away on their own<br>  <br>  I'd keep an eye on it over the next couple of weeks and if it changes to be extremely painful, different colour or size, go and see a doctor just like you would if a mole or something had done the same thing.|`|1bdF7N1saa	it could just be a bug but if its not from dry skin. Since its on yo breast ya really ccant pop it so keep a hot towel on it as much as you can and in between 2-3 days it should come to a head and burst on its own. Be sure to keep a towel and an extra shirt with you in case it decides to pop while you are no where near home.

zTnk59gGaa	A really easy way to get some more activity in is to do some sort of workout during the commercials of an hour long sitcom. On average, there are 20 minutes of commercials during an hour long show. If you do jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever during each commercial, you'll get your recommended minimum of 20 minutes of activity a day.     Another really easy thing to do is invest in a pedometer to count your steps (maybe $15?). Active is considered around 7,500 steps or above each day. To lose weight, they recommend 10,000 steps a day. It's really easy to do, especially when you have small children!     Good luck!|`|zPdG0SDeaa	Eat healthy, have maybe one junk food item per week.  Count calories and limit snacks.  Eat more veggies.|`|JovtfAfaaa	lots of water. Cut back on choclates and pop. Eat plenty of fruits and vegatables.

It makes you tired and hungier faster than regular sugar, plus it can give you health problems. they say it's one of the reasons why people are fatter these days.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	fruits and veggies    I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

AA11895162	Your doctor has agreed to accept whatever Medicare pays.  When you receive your bill from Medicare, it will explain it.  Don't pay your doctor anything until AFTER Medicare pays.    Medicare does pay alot for services provided, but it does save you money.    To clarify, Medicare is NOT Medicaid. Medicaid is the component in which your income is very low and you will qualify for public aid (Medicaid)|`|5TOp9HhHaa	Medicare doesn't work. Not very well, anyway.|`|eoZJO3J8aa	no you dont paid cuz medicare is for ppl with low income and need to relive on the government to pay for there bills..|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	Walk into a briar patch and scream .........that's medicare|`|5akokd0Faa	you cant be rich or you wont qualify|`|BcSZ4Jidaa	Medicare is government given medical insurance, if you are poor enough you can apply to be eligible for it, then when you go to the doctor or have an emergency your "medicare" covers it. Basically the government takes care of you because you dont make enough money.  hope that helps.|`|qEsas2Ssaa	You will still have to pay the 20% above and beyond what Medicare pays.  For example, if you see the Dr. and they charge $100, Medicare may allow somewhere around $60.  They will pay 80% of the amount they allow.  You will be responsible to the 20% of their allowed amount (unless you have a secondary insurance).  The Dr. is required to adjust off the amount Medicare does not allow.|`|G7fqgUo3aa	Medicare varies depending on what you need. If you have just Medicare, they only pay certain things and certain amounts. Many people have Medicare and a supplemental, or a Medicare Advantage Plan. You will want to do research for the different Medicare Plans, if you haven't chose one yet. You may still have an office copay for Dr's visits and you will still have a copay for prescriptions, depending on your plan. If you need medical supplies, then Medicare only pays 80%. It all varies, its not just black & white. Medicare is not for poor people, it is for elderly and disabled people. Medicaid is for lower income people.
2HmeJcxyaa	I know alot about herbs and supplements from working at GNC for years and these your speaking of can not hurt you in any reasonable dose.  You can take flaxseed oil, but the effects of it are very similar to those of fish oil (fish oil is better though in the long term) and there have been no real clinical studies done to show any great improvements from adding flaxseed when you are already on fish oil.  Hope this may help.|`|OsT64mqMaa	Ask a doctor. I would never trust someone on here to tell me if I was allowed to take more medicine.

SPlUKnpbaa	Depends upon whether you mean because of withdrawal symptoms - or whether you mean that your depression returns. In the first case, one way is to ask your GP to prescribe the syrup form - then use a syringe to measure and reduce the dose slowly. If you mean the latter - then you may simply be trying to come off them too soon. It is generally accepted these days that if someone comes of SSRIs too soon they are likely to suffer a relapse|`|f4doqdSCaa	Probably one of two things. Either you've stopped taking them abruptly, which isn't advised, you should taper off.... or you have a chemical imbalance which requires medication, and it's something you'll need to take on an ongoing basis. Good luck to you!|`|kTWzbhWWaa	Your body has become dependent on the drug.  Come off it slowly and don't expect yourself to be fine immediately.  It might take some time to adjust.|`|H2SD7T2raa	SSRI's are so hard to get off of because your body becomes dependent on them. Your body naturally releases a certain amount of seratonin for survival, but when you start feeding your body seratonin inhibitors, your body eventually becomes "lazy" and lets the medicine move the seratonin to the parts of your brain that it needs to reach to make you feel stable. Once the SSRI's are cut off, it takes weeks or even months for your body to start learning how to move that seratonin to where it needs to go again. Hang in there; it is a fight but there is a positive outlook on the horizon. |`|C8obM9GEaa	The medication is altering the chemicals in  your brain so whenever you start, stop or adjust your dosage you can experience side effects. <br>  <br>  I am on citalopram and mainly get dizzy and a kinda numb feeling whenever my dose is increased or decreased. Everyone reacts differently. <br>  <br>  If you really want to stop taking your medication then you need to consult your G.P. If he/she agrees that this is a good idea for you then they will advise you on how to do this with fewer side effects. This will probably involve cutting your doseage gradually.<br>  <br>  You should remember how powerful these drugs can be - maybe you shouldn't come off them. Some people need them for life, a bit like diabetics need insulin. |`|IbR9RJRyaa	It took me many many years to totally get off of these drugs.<br>  Sometimes I just got tired of taking them and stopped without dr approval. This last time i stayed on low dose for about a year and with Dr approval I stopped. I have been fine for a year now. :)<br>  <br>  Talk to your Dr and see what he/she says.
6XVUCtedaa	That is strange. I was told by the doctor not to drink coffee because it can bring on migraines.

I think the stress on our bodies caused by the hormones makes us less tolerant of pain.|`|df7e0a98adad7376c2265d7ad4d45e2faa	There is plenty of evidence to show that women are more sensitive to pain during and just before their period.<br>  Your temperature raises slightly too.|`|cR15v6DTaa	Yes, they are both<br>  very uncomfortable<br>  or so iv'e been told

yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|S730dpLfaa	Read a review about it here:  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|ktxEwCtpaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different trials and seeing the results.The site is pretty good at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.|`|43lWEr7Taa	You are on the right way. Instantly visit COLONCLEANSINGFACTS.PINURL.COM where you will get this product.     I have loosed my 15 pounds in a week. It is safe and they do clinical studies on these products.|`|Nqj18lFxaa	Hi. Honestly, when I first try it, it was not my intention to loose weight with it..But for me it worked. Also, when I saw that it worked in the first days, I've made a diet based on the pills..You should integrate this pills with you're lifestyle.    Hope it helps :)    Also..here is the link from where I bought the free trial http://acaiberryelite.info    My advice will be to take this on a long term..
6LtmIxhCaa	You should be looking for someone that looks the way you want to look. they know how they got there and can most likely get you there too.     You should be looking for someone that is nice, happy, will give you their number to call whenever you need advice. YOu should find someone that is in it for the people, not the money.    http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...
lTDeZ0Obaa	I have never heard of IBS stopping a menstrual cycle, usually the hormone fluctuations with menses can exacerbate IBS. If you are not pregnant and not menstruating the only thing to do (sorry) is see a doctor to get worked up. There can be many causes for having no period and none of them can be diagnosed over the internet, you need a physical exam and some testing. You probably need your hormone levels checked, your thyroid levels checked, as well as some other tests. The fatigue, anxiety, headache, sleeping problems, and heart palpitations can all be caused by hormone and/or thyroid imbalance...more than IBS. Thyroid imbalance can only be corrected with medication. It can lead to more severe problems if not corrected!    The stomach growth...or extreme bloating...as well as firmness of the abdomen can be normal with IBS during a flare-up or attack, but should go away between, it should not be constant!    You should be able to find a community clinic, which while not usually free, they do offer services on a sliding scale based on your income, so you don't pay full price! There are resources available for people without insurance...you just have to find them. Good luck!|`|igI5yX0vaa	IBS cannot cause that.  However, stress causes IBS and stress can cause skipped periods.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	hmm...  stress can stop your period,   i would go take a pregnancy test if you havent yet,   theyre free at the health dept and planned paretnhood|`|sIqGKNpaaa	I'm assuming you have done a pregnancy test and it is negative.  It is most likely that if you have missed a period before from stress this is happening again, and IBS is stress related a fair amount of the time.    If however, you have not got your period in another couple of months I would go to a community clinic - because there is also celiac disease which affects the gut and can present with missed periods.|`|02Uot5e8aa	It sounds as if you are under a lot of stress, which could lead to you having missed your period.  What concerns me though is that your stomach has grown? Are you POSITIVE your not pregnant? If there is even the slightest possibility of you being pregnant, you definately need to see some sort of a doctor; you could try a free walk in clinic maybe.    In order to be diagnosed with IBS, you need to go through a long line of tests that rule out other diseases; if there is no evidence of another disease (ie chrohn's disease, colon cancer, celiac disease etc).   Based on your symptoms, it could be a number of things, which is why you need to see a doctor.  In short, I doubt that IBS alone would be the reason you have missed your period.
6LtmIxhCaa	Meats are good for you. Fish is very lean and high in protein. If thats what you choose to do I don't see why not. I wouldn't be able to go with out steak though. hahaha.. but i also bodybuild. I don't like dropping below 230-225 ripped up.    http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...
clSvfDmVaa	Yes, please, go to a doctor.  Sleep problems can most certainly be related to eating habits.  And vice versa.|`|uapDu8RYaa	It sounds like you're just suffering from insomnia. Exercise for a few minutes a day this week. If that doesn't help, seeing a doctor couldn't hurt.    I've had chronic insomnia for the past 5 years, and it really isn't so bad.|`|48Wd4b6iaa	You should definitely see a doctor. Many things can cause this such as stress & depression as well as other neurological & gastrointestinal things.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	A doctor, you should see.|`|76SAdZ19aa	You should go to the doctor ASAP!|`|xgMjdWF0aa	SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY! People do die of starvation (i know you are not hungry though)     Try to eat small amount of food at a time (nutritious snacks, fruit smoothies, whole grain crackers with mozzerella cheese). These types of things can help keep you going throughout the long day. Make sure you drink a lot of water.    Stress and anxiety can also cause a lot of this so try meditating and getting some good hard excercise. It will free your mind of things that are on it.    I hope this helps! (and remember to see a doctor)|`|BSdvz7YGaa	something IS wrong, got to the doctors asap!
CljCJrT1aa	Typically you should do it for about 20 minutes every week for at least 3 days, more if you have time.|`|b007371eab69364e811cf06269921755aa	Great idea on the diet! Doing a low carb (less than 20g per day for the first 12 days) high fat diet is an excellent way to lose weight. It trains your body to burn fat for energy instead of carbs and it's a much more effective way to lose weight than a calorie deficit.     Don't neglect the weight lifting though. Weight lifting burns just as many calories as cardio and unlike cardio this continues for sometime after your workout is finished since your muscles need to be repaired. You'll be much more toned doing it this way, and you can always scale back on the weight lifting once you are happy with your body.|`|ykCo6SDOaa	You should not worry about a little extra muscle! Any exercise will at least tone muscle if not develop it to a larger size.    Jump rope can be quite effective for calorie burning if done vigorously enough.    Realistically to lose weight and keep it off you should aim for a calorie deficit every day and expect to lose about 2 lbs a weeks steady loss.    So allow about 8 weeks to lose 15lbs    You should build up the exercise you do gradually and aim to vary what you do to challenge a variety of muscle groups which will have a better overall result and can enhance the burning of calories.    You should not overdo the jump rope to soon but work up to periods of say 20 minutes to half an hour at least three times a week (day on day off) and eventually every day.    A vigorous period of exercise for about half an hour will probably burn about 200 to 400 calories depending on waht you do.    This will help in addfition to dietary changes to reduce high calorie items|`|6LtmIxhCaa	You will lose exactly 17 pounds and 11 ounces.    No one knows how much you will lose. We need more information such as your wieght now, your height, if your metabolism is fast,  slow or average. There are many factors. No one is YOU. You should know your body. Instead of asking people what does it matter? Will it really change the outcome if you do it with out asking anyone? If someone is wrong then you just blame them. DO it and do it the ebst you can. i am sur eyou won't be dissapointed.    http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...
Znmn2Dnsaa	Gah, I felt exactly like that a few days ago, but mine only lasted for 3 days. I felt like I was going to throw up, I had a headache and was just drained. The hunger thing sounds like what I had. Just eat very plain foods. The problem is you feel hungry, so you eat, but then you feel sick again and you wonder whether or not not eating as much is what's making you feel sick. What I did was drink plenty of water, rest, pain medication, showers and relaxing.     I know how much this sucks, really I do. At one stage I cried myself to sleep at night... a week is a long time, so I think you should visit your doctor. Trust me, knowing what's wrong with you will make you feel a lot better.|`|AA10531094	It could be a number of things.  You need to see a doctor.  Good Luck!|`|VNvVhDWgaa	Try some pepto bismal or some mylanta first. See if that helps settle things down. If however, you're still needing them after a week, then you definitely should see your doctor.

You can make your breasts bigger by having some patience and getting older, that's how it works, there aren't any magical ways other than surgery or being pregnant to make your actual breasts bigger, you just need to age.    You're so young that you probably have barely started developing if you have at all, so you just need to sit back and let time do its trick, because it's impossible to make them bigger any other way.|`|V88BvOnVaa	Maybe you might want to try herbal breast cream.

You also need to concentrate on a healthy diet (http://www.affredirect.com/fatloss2) to reduce those love handles and not just exercise.  The best exercises for your abs are:    Bicycle Exercise  Captain's Chair  Exercise crunch ball  Vertical leg crunch  Torso track  long arm crunch  Reverse crunch  Full verticle crunch  Ab rocker  Plank on elbows and toes    Regarding Vinegar the short answer is No.  According to the USDA, it contains no vitamin A, B6, C, E, K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, or folate.  It also contains no significant amounts of amino acids. Nor does it contain ethyl alcohol, caffeine, theobromine, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, or zeaxanthin. All healthy things that would make it good for  you.
	With the Depot Shot your period is gonna be almost nonexistent . You may have a period every three or four months.|`|	well for one go to the doctor  but my mom was on that shot and she began having seizures after coming off that shot so i would suggest takin something else :)|`|	Just because you miss a period does not necessarily mean you are pregnant.  Usually within about 5 days after you should have started your period you can take an at home test.|`|	Possibly.. But with coming off depo I would probably wait like 2 weeks after my periods supposed to come to test.. If negative it could be your body adjusting to coming off depo.. Some dnt have period after for months|`|	I would first of all find someone close to You to talk to that You can trust.    Here is some information I found from the company that explains a little bit... I hope it helps!    What effect will Depo-Provera have on my periods or menstrual  cycles?    * Changes in menstrual bleeding occur with most women. These changes are  normal and do not cause a problem.    * Most women have a decrease in the amount of menstrual bleeding.    * Many women have spotting at irregular intervals.    *Other women have no bleeding at all, called amenorrhea. This does not mean you are pregnant.    * Over time bleeding decreases and many women stop having periods with continued use of Depo-Provera.    * Heavy bleeding is not usual. Call your doctor if this occurs.    How soon can I get pregnant after stopping Depo-Provera?    Depo-Provera is a long acting method of birth control. It will likely take sometime for you to become pregnant after you stop the shots. Most women who wish to become pregnant after stopping the shots have become pregnant within 12-18 months.   There is a chance You could be pregnant, but You must find someone You can trust to take You to a clinic or family planning center to get a test.         I remember years ago feeling scared about getting pregnant during High School and worrying about birth control that wouldn't work.   My daughter's friend got pregnant and was scared at 15 yrs old.   She had her baby and is doing just fine... She has a healthy baby and still attends school and works living at home with family that watches the baby only when she is at school and work.   She says it is tough raising a baby at 15, but she will make it!  I know You can too if You are pregnant.. if You aren't and aren't in a position not ready for kids,  Please talk to someone that will listen and support You helping You get the right birth control so You can get an education and be able to work and have something to help raise a baby!       You are worth taking care of Yourself pregnant or not... *Sends Tight Hugs*|`|	You have to wait 2 weeks after your missed period. See a dcc hun, and I definitely don't recomend the shot.|`|	ok, this is really complicated, so really read through it and listen to the directions carefully!:  1.)go to the drugstore.  2.)get a pregnancy test   3.)pee on the stick!  dont mean to be rude and all, but seriously, the tests are only like, 7 bucks and its really easy, or you could go to the doctor!
xKYXurpNaa	This totally depends on your body weight and you should be eating a diet which consists of around 70% carbs, 15% protein and 15% fat if you exercise a lot.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	There is no standard rule. A guy wiht a million degrees will not even giev you the 100% correct answer. Just take in high amounts of protein, high amounts of carbs and low fats.    This will work no matter who you are.    Take in at the very least 1 gram of protein per pound. 2 grams per pound if you are trying to bodybuild    here is my myspace. I am 5'10 235 pounds and 21 years old. i have a full six pack. i have no degree in science but I do have experience. you can read all the books you want and it still won't beat experience.  http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...

It is still important to eat it in moderation though. Just because something is healthy doesn't mean you are allowed to overdue it.      I wouldn't say it is easy to make money with though. It is very expensive so it is going to be pretty hard to sell when the customer will think he can just go to the grocery store and buy dark chocolate there.
PpKJIT0aaa	It's not really a depression issue, but a motivational one. Get a piece of paper, divide it in half. On the left side, write down without censoring, all the things that hold you back from succeeding in life the way you want. Just let it all out, no matter how silly, weird or crazy it might seem.    Then on the right hand side, put down all the good things in life. Not only that you actually HAVE a family that cares for you, a good school to attend, friends there, etc. but your aspirations, dreams, hopes, ideas, goals, etc. Then understand that to accomplish ANYTHING, YOU have to get out there to make it happen.     You don't have to have all your ducks lined up in a row, but once you START, the Universe can then begin to support you... just as it has always done, and always will.|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Not wanting to go school may be just one of those "teenage" things.

Y2P9m21Gaa	Im 16 years old and went through the same exact thing last year. I wanted to get rid of the hair down there so bad, but i wasnt about to go get it done by a professional. Since its such a sensitive area, it probably does hurt extremely bad the first time, but it gets easier after that. I would say to just shave for the first time, like I did. It saved me from a lot of embarrassment and it was pretty simple. Later on if you change your mind and think its too much work, you can always start waxing then.   If you shave, be careful not to cut yourself.. go slowly and gently.  If you get it waxed by a professional just stay as calm and relaxed as possible  and if you wax it yourself make sure its not too hot and take a deep breath.  Hope this helped a little! Good luck!|`|i4dxPOZIaa	you should wax  it will hurt for a day or to but its worth getting it done  the hair doesn't come back for a while and you won't get razor burn so your not always itching that place.

Just remember to use a good shaving cream and a brand name good razor that wont irratate you down there.  I would suggest Venus razors.   Also as weird as it may seem it wouldnt be a bad idea to just ask your mom or trusting close female friends or family member to give you advice and tips.     Anyway good luck!!!!|`|OXdgArw4aa	im going through the same thing as you atm,   i tried shaving and as it grows back it became itchy, since then ive just trimmed, like you im embarassed to get a wax.

Shaving can leave very bad rashes that take a while to go away, especially if you do it a lot, like you said you would.    So, in your situation, I say waxing. And you don't have to be embarassed. They do it to so many other people, and you won't be the worst.|`|r1nKp9ELaa	if you can handle the pain, get a wax.  shaving is god but you cant do it everyday.   and only do it if you have to.(if your doing anything that involves a guy going down there) otherwise theres really no point.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	laser therapy eliminates hair permanently|`|ERrHTcBXaa	Wax, seems to be a safer option but probably far more painful at first  but also waxed looks a lot better than shaved|`|sgoF3Klwaa	shaving or whatever is your own choice but if you go somewhere to get it waxed, the people are gonna think you are wayyy to young to be getting that done

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|k8F0n289aa	your like me   but don't keep an eye on your weight i use to be weighing myself like 6 times a day..  your weight has to go up dosen it but  eight yourself every 2 weeks :)  and excercise  longer say an hour drink nothing but water  eat alot of good food like fruit and veg =]  xx|`|s9ZUMI5maa	Exercise more.

Change up your type workouts,  change the timing of your workouts like start working out in the mornings.  Change your meals.  Try new stuff.|`|nz8o3lLSaa	Its very simple.  You need to burn more calories than you intake every single day.  This means you will have to watch what you eat or exercise more than 1/2 an hour a day.    If losing weight were easy, everyone would be thin.
q9BItD25aa	There are many on site  "Free Clinics"...depending where you live.His Doctor can give him places to call, and some hospitals have funds set up to cover all expenses.

5C5APT8Vaa	I just had Lasik last week.  It was actually the new bladeless one where the laser creates the cornea flap.  It is very good so far.  I couldn't even see the big "E" on the doctor's office chart before and now, just a week after, I can see 20/20 without glasses or contacts.  It is so nice.  As for the reduced night vision  that was discussed, Lasik Plus has a procedure called Wavefront where if you have bad night vision (which they determine in a free exam for you) will fix your night vision problems.  I had this done and it has worked extremely well.  <br>  <br>  I would definitely recommend Lasik Plus locations.  They do a free exam and tell you what would be best for you.  <br>  <br>  As for the deteriorated vision, I hope not.  I don't know yet.  However, my mom had Lasik back in 1999 and she still needs no contacts or glasses.  Her boyfriend had it done in 2001 and he also still does not need any vision correction.  However, if you ever did, Lasik Plus has free enhancement procedures so it is really worth it.  <br>  <br>  I would definitely check it out.  The exam is totally free.|`|PIcomI6Oaa	Yes, very good with that. Maybe nite vision are reduced.|`|u17FuCiGaa	I have not had lasik, but as someone who knows the severe and unending pain of ocular surface disorders, I strongly urge you to read this story and ask yourself if it is what you want for the rest of your life- it may be a small risk in this severity, but it is a risk you step up and willingly take for a cosmetic procedure. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dryeyezone.com/talk/showthread.php?t=53" rel="nofollow">http://dryeyezone.com/talk/showthread.ph...</a><br>  <br>  I will highlight some:<br>  <br>  "I have extreme LASIK-induced dry eyes. I wear air-tight goggles in my house, in my car and outside. I avoid public places, and shy away from social gatherings. The moving air of shopping malls and grocery stores intensifies my constantly burning eyes. I am terribly sensitive to sunlight, even with tinted goggles. Dry eye pain and burning wake me in the middle of every single night. I can no longer read or watch TV for pleasure."

Mixing pure whey protein without any artificial sweeteners, additives, or fillers and mixing it with your favorite fruits!

n5o46oWTaa	Dont worry, they wont put braces on a loose tooth. When they put the brakets on they just cement them onto your teeth, it doesnt hurt. Then they put on the wires and it just feels like someone pushing on your teeth, its just pressure. Once they put the little rubber bands on the hold the wire in place then it hurts a bit, theres a constant ache that doesnt really go away because the braces are moving your teeth. When you first get them put on, dont eat solids, its like having a loose tooth and wacking it. It hurts. Dont be scared, braces make your teeth look amazing and you'll love the result. Have fun with the colors! Mine are blue, (dont get black or clear, it makes your teeth look dirty)<br>  <br>  Braces hurt mainly at first but then you get use to them. I dont even notice them anymore. Good luck.|`|Po4gGipPaa	Don't be scared! I'm getting my braces this tuesday! I'm actually really excited, because baby you're gonna have so much fun flauntin' those pearly whites after the braces are off, haha! I heard it will hurt, from friends I have with braces. But not to worry! I got told to take tylenol, and it should take some of the pain away. And I don't believe they'll put it on a loose tooth, because it's obviously loose for a reason! ( trying to come out ).. so they won't force your tooth to stay if it wants out :P Good luck thursday though!! :)|`|QJwaagGWaa	Yes, they do hurt. The reason is because your teeth are getting adjusted to something they were not used to. But hey, look at the bright side, I had the worst fricken teeth you could ever imagine, and now thanks to the braces, my teeth are fixed. Oh and dont cry, and dont be scared, because who knows, you may like them fricken braces.   :)|`|z2SODuR9aa	dont be scared..i was SOO nervous when i got my braces and once they started to put them on they didnt hurt at all..it was the after affect that made it painful..just drink advil or tylenol before you put on the braces so that it wont hurt as much and DO NOT eat solid foods it will make them soooo painful!!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|8c0ba11ad1255627e19b46dc4353a732aa	It hurts a little bit but not I want to die pain more like a dull aching pain that Tylanol or Motrin or Advil gets rid of.  To me it felt like my mouth was bruised. Any way take a pain reliever when you get to the office so it will be kicked in before they finish up and take it every 4-6 hours for the first 3 days. Eat soft easy to chew foods and you will be fine.<br>  Believe it or not but a scraped elbow or knee hurts worse than getting braces. |`|pqit18wBaa	Relax. They don't put brackets on baby teeth. They hurt because the wires use certain amounts of pressure to mvoe your teeth. They do hurt, but not OMG I'm gonna bawl cuz my leg just got chopped off hurt. Take an ibuprofen, wear some dental wax, and you'll be fine. Have fun choosing the colors (if they offer them)!<br>  I was really scared at first too. But i talked to my orthodntist, and now they're no big deal. :-)<br>  <br>  congrats|`|XpNkNtW7aa	yes, its because there metal wires that are attached to your teeth that get smaller and smaller, moving your teeth|`|MJaTgSQlaa	they hurt for a few days just dope up on pain killers and itll be all good

Instead of thinking about using heroin, just remember the trouble it caused. I was a heroin addict for years as well, I’ve been clean for over 5 years now. The worse part about recovery is most people find they have lost contact with their old friends and everyone’s moved on with their life’s. It’s just the way it goes. I’m not an expert on drug rehabilitation but if you want, email me and I would be happy to try and help you with advice.|`|nhchWETvaa	keep up the good work, every day you get through go to bed with a smile and congratulate your self, take up a hobby to keep your mind of this.<br>  skinny|`|Q9Fx9FEmaa	hi, drop me an email and i can give you some help if you like, i've been clean a long time and no a solution!!<br>  <br>  up too you!!<br>  <br>  |`|HeZorcNWaa	Get yourself to a meeting (NA). <br>  <br>  I don't know whether you used to attend meetings or ever went through the twelve steps, but meetings are a great way of staying clean, however long you've been gear-free for.<br>  <br>  I've not been clean a year yet and I haven't chosen to do the twelve steps. I'm not religious and I resisted the meetings for a long time thinking I'd be talked into praying or going in to a program etc. I wasn't. I've made some great sober friends and even if I'm too scared to speak listening is a great therapy. I don't often talk in the meetings, but often chat more outside over a cigarette or over a coffee with one of the guys afterwards or before. <br>  <br>  Getting clean has meant changing my entire life (as you probably know) and through meetings I've already made some good and 'safe' friends who understand why I find it hard and dont judge me, no matter the mistakes I've made or things I've done. <br>  <br>  Talking and listening are great ways to get all the crap away from yourself so you dont have to dwell on it or carry it around with you.  <br>  <br>  There are NA meetings every day and a lot are open and so anyone can attend. You can spill your guts out (if that's what you need), swear your head off and not be judged, or listen to others. You can get support, make friends and get good advise. <br>  <br>  Give it a try. It has got to be better than pulling your hair out or picking up. <br>  <br>  Soberrecovery.com is also a great place to share and get support. Give it a go. There are some great people, and if you dont like it you've not lost anything.<br>  <br>  Plus, remember recovery ain't ever over. We're always learning.|`|C9eUncRuaa	Fortunately I cannot say that I have shared the experience of heroin addiction. Maybe you should find a hobby or start playing some sort of sport. You need something to occupy your time, also surround yourself with people who care i,e, not those who are negative or whom will bring you down. <br>  I have heard heroin is very addictive. I thinking quitting is quite an accomplishment, well done. |`|jYCJrPEBaa	one thing is you need to not substitute an addiction with another addiction but research is being done on salvia's anti-addictive ability and also find things in life that mean more to you than the drug an focus on them
dZ4uMyk0aa	There are several medications to treat anxiety (ask your doctor). Some people just smoke a certain -illegal in most states -herb when they're feeling stressed.

There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind.

070Jg5c0aa	just a regular sore throat.<br>  if you stopped smoking, it would do QUITE a bit of good to make this better.<br>  please realize that you do not need an antibiotic to get better - even if it IS  a strep throat.<br>  <br>  antibiotics are not given to make the sore throat better, but to prevent rheumatic fever - a syndrome that can happen a couple of weeks after the sore throat has resolved.  In the past several decades, rheumatic fever has ALMOST completely disappeared, so that it has become highly questionable whether a sore throat should EVER be given an antibiotic, even if proven streptococcal.<br>  <br>  In general you should NOT see the doctor for a sore throat unless you have fever (defined as Temp > 101 F) or white spots on your tonsils -- those are clues to strep etiology, but can also be found in mononucleosis and even regular viral infections. So these findings are not specific for strep, but are a reasonable indication that a doctors visit is in order.|`|M3Qc8Wneaa	Ok because you smoke I would be concerned about your sweating at night, fever is not a usual  symptom of your period. go to your doctor you either have a sever throat infection that could affect you ability to breath if left untreated or the beginnings of throat cancer.|`|AA10498729	Sounds like when I had Strep.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	it sounds like a throat infection to me.

I have done it. <br>  <br>  Ecstasy is a mixture of drugs, including MDMA (but mostly other things).<br>  <br>  I remember liking pink pumas and blue dolphins a lot.<br>  <br>  But I know how to enjoy myself without the aid of anything else now. <br>  <br>  And what you can find is probably different all over, since these are man made.|`|9YkkQbbPaa	You aren't likely to find pills that are pure MDMA anymore. They are still out there, but they're really hard to find.<br>  <br>  If you're in California, I can tell you that the "pokeball" pills (ones with a line and a dot on the back) seem to be coming from a really good, honest chemist who isn't cutting them with bad stuff. Just MDMA and nonactive binders. Outside of that, I can't really recommend anything. Maybe .G's Up Hoes Down pills on the east coast. The original ones are MDA and have the dot before the G. There are copycats of them going around, though so watch out.<br>  <br>  If you had those pills in the past couple of months, you had some good stuff. The glocks were MDMA + a small bit of amphetamine, so they weren't clean. But they had a majority of MDMA and were a good roll. From what I've heard, the Blue ladies are MDA and are still floating around in places.<br>  <br>  To be really sure of what you're getting , buy a testing kit. And ALWAYS test your pills before you consume them. You can even usually ask your dealer to allow you test them before you buy.<br>  <br>  Stay safe.|`|TbGVQMctaa	Well first off, I don't think amphetamines are a good choice of drug, and I think there are many good and safe choices.<br>  <br>  Pure MDMA/MDA/MDEA pills are apparently almost non-existent now.  Secondly, all logos/colors of pills are random; some started off with reputations years and years ago when there weren't many suppliers.  But, people started copy-catting popular pills and pressing theirs the same logo/color.<br>  <br>  So basically you can't tell nowadays unless you have a reagent testing kit which can be bought on <a href="http://www.dancesafe.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dancesafe.org</a> , which is a sensible harm reduction site.|`|w3IGl1Ayaa	in my experience none!espec MDMA,it made me violently sick!ecstasy is cut with all sorts of **** these days,the original stuff in late 80s early 90s was purer ,but today its cheap and nasty and not to be recomended at all,if you MUST take e s please be sensible!!!!!!i aint gonna lecture you ,hell i did it all myself when younger,but please take care if you do|`|HF1TfsnTaa	You need re-hab and it doesn't come in a pill.|`|f7epj2tRaa	pure MOLLY (MDMA).

A 2 minute blood test will soon find the problem!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	think about it, anemia is the lack of red blood cells, red blood cells carry oxygen, so if you don't have enough red blood cells, you don't get the oxygen your tissues need and you feel short of breath, I doubt you have leukemia, there's a lot worse symptoms than what  you mention here.<br>  go see your doctor.|`|Ga9iqBDCaa	Don't let anyone frighten you. The best thing is to see your Doctor as soon as you can.   This way, you will know for sure what is the matter and that is always easier to cope with.<br>  My mother was exactly the same as you with shortness of breath too and it was  diagnosed as Anaemia. This was easily treated and she soon felt much better!|`|UZcUIfwIaa	I'm no doctor but if you're anaemic you'll be short of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen so low on blood cells = low on oxygen. So shortness of breath as body tries to compensate and take in more oxygen. But to be that bad you'd have to be very anaemic. Heavy periods will not help...Go See You Doc ASAP........!|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Maybe you should stop fretting and actually do something about it.No one in YA can do blood tests for you and as that's the only way you'll get a definitive answer you best see a doctor.Sorry to be harsh but you appear to be avoiding the inevitable and need telling.|`|44beb11ab3942a2ae13018419e91317caa	Only when she rubs me in a special way|`|AA11025000	Anaemia means you blood is not carrying enough oxygen, so yes, shortness of breath is to be expected after any exertion.

And then I would press on it and it'd come out in the shape of a small, slightly hard rock looking thing. Haha. Those are called tonsil stones and are harmless. They can be quite annoying though.

Once you get into a regular, consistent exercise routine, you'll feel so great you'll never want to return to your slothful self.<br>  <br>  For toning your butt and thighs think cardio (but not sustained cardio, rather sprints and plyometric jumps) and weights (lunges, squats, presses).

I simply eliminated all sugar not already present naturally. I'm sure she's done the same. She may have to alter things as a vegetarian, though. Fruit has much more sugar in it than I thought. Apples have a huge amount, which surprised me. She needs more protein, and a more varied diet. You can't quickly bring down sugars through diet alone. Raise 'em yeah, but not lower. It's a gradual thing but it can easily be done. Good Luck and stay tough. <br>  <br>  Seriously, what's a "pulse"?|`|BP9qcjvbaa	I think that your friend should eat a lot of chick peas, soya beans, kidney and lentils because they are all pulses and good sources of protein.

4PoP8QMOaa	Hi LCMarie.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to have to go see your general doctor first.<br>  <br>  If you do happen to have a general doctor, you could call him/her to simply ask for a referral. You don't have to go into detail as to why you need the referral.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a general doctor who you can call for a referral, there are other ways to get a name. The best way is word of mouth. Many people see psychiatrists, so you may know someone who is happy with the one she/he sees.<br>  <br>  If that is not an option, there are still other ways. All hospitals have referral departments. You simply call a hospital and ask for their Referral Department. When you get them, you tell them you are looking for a psychiatrist in whatever location you need the doctor to be. They will give you a few names. Then you can call them, decide which one "sounds" the  best and make an appointment.<br>  <br>  The least desirable manner of finding a doctor of any kind is the telephone book (or internet). But you can look there if you need to. If you have to, try to find centers that say they treat ADD, anxiety and depression. That's a safer bet than just picking a name.<br>  <br>  Never get your medication from a general doctor. Many will give you meds, but they do not have the experience that psychiatrists have in those areas and in the medications used to treat those conditions. They know the basics; but a psychiatrist will know all the fine details, the best meds, what's new, etc. So, try to find a psychiatrist in whatever way you can.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been helpful for you.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	There is always free or reduced care mental health.

It is a complete protein, containing all essential amino acids, though with reduced amounts of methionine, cysteine, and lysine when compared to the proteins of meat, eggs, and milk. It is, however, superior to typical plant protein, such as that from legumes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Athletes need additional protein for increased strength and to enhance their performance. Spirulina is rich in protein, Vitamin B complex such as vitamin B1 ,B2 and B3, calcium, iron and carotene which is beneficial for workouts. <br>  <br>

AA12121778	If you're really serious about reducing your waist line, crunches aren't going to do it for you, my friend. Crunches strengthen the underlying muscles beneath your jelly belly; they DO NOT help zap the fat off of it. The only way to deflate that spare tire is to restrict your caloric and fat intake by following a sensible eating plan and by doing regular aerobic exercise sessions. For best weight loss results, aim for 3-5 aerobic workouts weekly that last anywhere from 30-60 minutes.     By aerobic, I mean walking, jogging, cycling, skating -- anything that uses your larger muscle groups in your legs, back and chest in a rhythmic, repetitive fashion, gets you breathing heavy and can be sustained continually for a relatively long period of time, say 15 minutes or more. You can use your imagination on that one....     And while we're on the topic: belly fat IS cause for concern. Studies have shown that where you store your fat is probably as important as how much you have. People who tend to store their excess fat around the tummy (the so-called apple shaped body) are at greater risk for coronary heart disease and diabetes than people who tend to store their fat below the waist line (the so-called pear shaped body). If you tend toward the apple shape, reducing your weight will not only improve your appearance, it may help you live longer too.     Here's a quick and easy method to determine your risk of cardiovascular heart disease based upon fat storage: Take your waist measurement to the nearest half inch and your hip measurement to the nearest half inch; measure the smallest part of your middle, a few inches above your navel, and the largest circumference of your hip area that includes your buttocks.     Now divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement to determine your waist-to- hip ratio. If you're a woman and it's greater than .8 or a man and it's greater than .9, you should work hard to reduce your body fat and thus reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes.|`|AA11070406	lift the tire in and out of the car.|`|AA10289095	hi :) am not sure whats available in the markets...but, this is what i did to lose weight... PLEASE DONT TAKE PILLS... pills are nothing but anorectic agents... they make you feel less hungry... there is no way to loose weight fast... though , sauna , steam and massages help slightly... it has to be combined with diet and excercise... pills are very bad in the long run... can lead to impotency and infertility...    Also... short term diets are no good because , they terribly pull down your body metabolism rate since you dont eat much during that period ... Because of this , once you break your diet , you'll start putting on more weight, the reduced body metabolism will take longer and slower to burn the food you take in...    They also dont work because once you break your diet and start eating normally, you will get back to your normal weight as you might not be cautious as to how many cals you take in per day...      i lost 10 kgs in about 5 months time... i am getting married in august and i desperately needed to loose weight... i was 65 kilos when i started... according to my BMI , i was 10kgs + overweight... i stand 5'2.odd and 65 kilos is grossly overweight...    just dieting wont help like i found out in my case... diet + exercise will do the trick...    i'll tell you what i did... it worked for me... hope it works for you too :)    the trick is not to starve but to eat smart :) and stay healthy :)    what you should cut down :  oil , butter , cheese , margarine , mayonisse , sauces (depends , will get back to that a bit later), chips , crisps, nuts , chocolates , sugar , cola, fizz , areated drinks ,ice creams , chocolate , alcohol , cakes and everything else thats hi - cal... you'll need to avoid everything thats sweet , oily and sticky... if you are not sure about what foods to avoid... check the net...loads of info available...    vegetables / meat to avoid :  potatoes - very very important , beetroot (its a root and has concenterated sugar in it) , all kinds of roots basically except carrot... avoid lamb, mutton , pork , beef, and prawns... all these put on weight... eat only lean meats... thats fish and chicken.. avoid eating egg yolk... eat just the egg white...    fruits to avoid :  mangoes , bananas , jackfruit      now that we had a look at what foodstuff is to be avoided...you might be wondering if there is anythig at all that you can eat... thats how i felt... there is loads of stuff you can eat actually :)    here they come :)    fast foods are a big no no... you can order salads and special lo cal foods that are avaailable in most outlets...    its best to eat at home for the period you are dieting and trying to lose weight...after those few months... once you've shed your load...you can get back to your usual lifestyle... of course with some caution...      my diet...  breakfast:    skimmed milk (use skimmmed milk , is low in fat , other typer of milk are higher in fat content) , fruit... i am from India... am not sure where you are from and hence you might not understand certain food types we consume here... but let me tell you something... Indian food is very very oily and very difficult to diet...    and try cereal in the mornings... oats, weetabix... etc... have a good breakfast...alwaays use brown bread... whole wheat brown bread is very good for weight reduction...      for lunch , we are staple rice eaters... rice is bad for fat reduction... but i still took rice because its a habit tht cant be changed... everyone takes rice here... so... rice - one cup - 100gms and lots of veggies cooked in less oil.. and absolutely no coconut and curry with less oil... all in all keep your oil intake to 2 tea spoons everyday... that would be just for seasoning... also using olive oil helps a lot...      then for dinner... compulsarily have wheat... pasta is a good option...but make sure you buy wheat pasta... check before buying... and of course in pasta absolutely no sauces... some varities of sauces are acceptable... as far as they dont have cheese , butter , oil ,mayonisse and fattening substances in general... you can use tomato spicy sauces etc... make sure your sugar intake doesnt cross 2 - 3 spoons per day... (not tablespoons) and no butter and ghee of course... eat a lot of fruits and vegetables... and all kinds of cereal... if you are hungry... eat a fruit... or you can eat stuff like puffed wheat and puffed rice... but no puffed corn... corn products again put on weight...      eat sandwiches as much as possible... i dont know which part of the world you are from and hence cant suggest much for you in terms of recepies...    and combined with dieting... you need to excercise for atleast an hour everyday... you'll see the difference...defenitely... if you think gym is boring... take up dance classes... or run along the beach... if you have one... or skate... or just about any physical activity... brisk walking will also help...  the key is to stay healthy while you diet and lose weight...    drink loads of water...atleast 6 glasses per day... and do a lot of physical activity.... take the stairwy instead of the lift.... and small things like that...  if you have any more queries...mail me... cheers :) and good luck :) its not difficult...you'll get used to it in a few days... and of course the results are fab:) who doesnt want a great looking body...    you can get back to your normal lifestyle once you slim down... after that... its just eating what you like and burning it out the next day with just a little bit of excercise :) also check your weight everyday... its a great way to motivate and monitor your progres :)    Source(s):    personal exp :)

2b03b57636ac3d2c67d120485414cfe6aa	Globally, public health agencies have implemented policies to help prevent and control typhoid.  These include improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and good medical care.  In some communities those goals are too lofty and some believe that vaccination for high risk populations is the best way.  There are currently two vaccines in common use.    To better understand prevention, you need to study the disease itself.  Typhoid is caused by a virulent and invasive bacterium called Salmonella typhi.  This bacteria spreads through contaminated food or water and occasionally through direct contact with someone that is already infected.  In developing countries, the cause is generally poor santitation and contaminated drinking water.  Industrialized countries usually see typhoid when a traveler brings it back from a trip and then spreads it to others via the fecal-oral route.    To personally protect yourself from typhoid you can avoid traveling to areas that are endemic to the disease.  If you do travel, consider taking the vaccine.  While the vaccine is useful, it isn't 100% so it is advised that you wash your hands frequently, avoid untreated water (drink bottled or canned water, carbonated water is best, wipe all bottles and cans before using, no ice, bottled water when brushing teeth, etc.), avoid raw fruits and vegetables, choose cooked foods.|`|AA12346188	First of all you should know what is Typhoid Fever.

Il s'agit d'une inflammation des gencives cause par l'accumulation de plaque dentaire et de tartre. La plaque dentaire est un film bactrien invisible et collant qui s'accumule sur les dents. Elle est produite par une combinaison de diverses bactries, de morceaux d'aliments et de salive. La plus grande concentration de plaque se retrouve entre les dents et sous le bord des gencives. Avec le temps, la plaque se transforme en tartre, une substance granuleuse et dure que seul le dentiste peut enlever.    Les deux principaux signes du dbut de la maladie parodontale, ou gingivite, sont un saignement des gencives lors du brossage et une mauvaise haleine. Les gencives peuvent aussi tre rouges, enfles et sensibles au toucher. Une gingivite non traite peut se transformer en parodontite.  cette tape, l'os qui soutient les dents commence  se dtriorer. Sans traitement, les dents deviennent mobiles et devront tre extraites.    Les maladies parodontales sont la cause principale de la perte des dents chez les adultes. Prs de 75 % des adultes souffrent de problmes des gencives  divers degrs au cours de leur vie. Les personnes qui portent des prothses ne sont pas  l'abri de telles maladies. Le brossage des dents ou des prothses, l'utilisation quotidienne de la soie dentaire et des visites rgulires chez le dentiste demeurent les meilleurs moyens de prvenir ces maladies.    D'autres facteurs peuvent aussi contribuer  l'apparition des maladies parodontales, notamment :    Des conditions qui affectent le systme immunitaire telles qu'un mauvais fonctionnement de la glande thyro?de, le diabte, la grossesse, la leucmie ;   Des facteurs hrditaires ;   De mauvaises habitudes, notamment se nourrir mal, se ronger les ongles, serrer ou grincer les dents, faire usage de tabac, consommer trop de sucre ;   La prise de certains mdicaments, incluant les anovulants, et de drogues.     Diagnostic et traitement   Le dentiste peut diagnostiquer et traiter les maladies parodontales ds leur dbut. Il orientera les cas intermdiaires et avancs vers des parodontistes au besoin, qui sont des spcialistes du traitement des maladies parodontales.     Le traitement parodontal vise  rtablir la sant des gencives. Il ncessite habituellement un dtartrage, soit un enlvement de la plaque et du tartre accumuls sur les dents, un aplanissement des racines, une technique visant  rendre lisse la racine des dents aprs que les dbris aient t enlevs, et un curetage ou grattage de la plaque et des tissus enflamms des gencives. Dans les cas graves, il peut tre ncessaire de pratiquer des interventions chirurgicales pour enlever le tartre log dans des poches qui se sont formes entre les gencives et les dents.|`|AA10909400	tu souffres de gingivites et tu dois prendre une pate  dent spcialement consue pour cela.

AA10240911	Here's a link with lots of great info on how to trim your waist: http://ezinearticles.com/?A-Smaller-Wais...    Hope this helps!  ~Tia~|`|AA11531905	Hi,    Congrats on your decision to get fit.  It's challenging, but fun.  Your first order of business is to get your diet straight.    I'm a PT and aerobics instructor, I have young clients like you and they are the best students, they see results fast IF they follow direction.    In 5 or 6  small meals, spaced evenly apart, eat 10 x your body weight in calories (if you weight 180, you will eat 1800 cals, ets) .  Every meal should have a complex carb and a lean protein,  in the above example you might eat 6 meals at 300 cals,  4 oz of chicken breast is about 120 cals, a small serving of brown rice is 100, the rest can be veggies.    Drink LOTS of water and no alcohol or sodas,. even diet sodas can be a problem.    Once you have that down find a nice, full body CORE , weight routine that suits you.  If you were to do about 21 working sets, 3x a week, that would be sufficient.  THere are 100's of websites with routines on them, but you should be doing 3 sets of a particular exerscise, 8-12 reps with a minute or so between sets.  Your cadence will be "1 up and 2 down"  and be sure to feel the targeted muscle and get a full range of motion.  At the end of each set you should feel like you can do one or two more, get an experience spotter to work with you and point out your form.    A good starter routine is:    Ab crunches to warm up    chest press, 3 sets  Lat Pulldowns, 3 sets  Back Exensions, 3 sets  Shoulder presses, 3 sets  Shoulder Raises, 3 sets  leg presses or extensions, 3 sets  hamstring curls, 3 sets    Vary useing free weights, dumbells and equipment.    After your 30-40 minute weight workout, get a quick stretch and then do 45 minutes of cardio, 10 minutes to warm up, 30 minutes at about 75% MHR [ (211-age)x.75   cool down for 5 minutes,  stretch again.  A hot shower  post workout will help eliminate soreness.    On your off days do just the cardio work and be sure to take 1 whole day off a week, you can even have  cheat meal on that day if you like.!    WOO HOO

Try swimming during the day in cold water and try not to do anything too vigorous.  Wear thin clothes so you don't overheat.  However, another possibility is that you have diabetes.  A common symptom of diabetes is frequent thirstiness due to blood sugar problems.  Ask you parents to see a doctor soon.  There may also be some sort of feminine problem, but I doubt this.  Nonetheless, I'm not a doctor, so I'm not so sure.  Take a safe route: if you think your condition is extreme, then go see a doctor.|`|8e03798cb7561304de352afd0e06f2b0aa	Hello, if this continues....You should tell your parents about it.

The rectum can be pushed through or blown through the anus.  This is very dangerous and can lead to death.  It means the intestines have perforated the anus.

I had to have that damn bag hooked up to my leg for 8 weeks.One of the results of having the 8" IV tube in my leg so long was a large lump, but it was due to the formation of a basic callous of sorts from the irritation from the flexible IV tube. Once it was removed it took about 4 weeks to finally stop irritating me.

A lot of women do very well on Premarin but since hormone therapy isn't a one size fits all deal, it's good that we have options.    Bio-identical hormones aren't necessarily more expensive than non-bios. Bio-identicals can be in the form of compounded hormones from a compounding pharmacy but they are also manufactured by the pharmaceutical companies. Things such as Estrace (pill), Climara and Vivelle Dot (patches) Estrasorb (a lotion) and EstroGel (a gel) are all bio-identical hormones which are readily available by prescription from the pharmacy. I've read that the generic Estrace pill can be purchased very inexpensively as part of the affordable prescription program in which many pharmacies are participating so you could check into that.

If the doctor can't provide your mother any information - I'm sure you can take your dad down to the doctors and tag along.

I hope your friend's husband beats this. Don't give up hope.    Stage 0 carcinoma in situ.   Stage I cancers are localized to one part of the body.   Stage II cancers are locally advanced, as are stage III   Stage III cancers. Whether a cancer is designated as Stage II or Stage III can depend on the specific type of cancer; for example, in Hodgkin's Disease, Stage II indicates affected lymph nodes on only one side of the diaphragm, whereas Stage III indicates affected lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The specific criteria for Stages II and III therefore differ according to diagnosis.   Stage IV cancers have often metastasized, or spread to other organs or throughout the body.   Within the TNM system, a cancer may also be designated as recurrent, meaning that it has appeared again after being in remission or after all visible tumor has been eliminated. Recurrence can either be local, meaning that it appears in the same location as the original, or distant, meaning that it appears in a different part of the body.|`|0d98b44d962e705484337a48e0b25b85aa	stage 4 is a classification on how much the disease has spread.

As has been said before, stage 4 cancer exists whenever a cancer of one part of the body gets into the blood and spreads to other areas.     Obvsiously a stage 4 cancer is very serious and is worse than the lower stages however her prognosis still depends on what TYPE of cancer it was (for example testicular is much more easily treated than say lung) and where it has spread (better to have spread to say, the spleen or liver than the brain or lungs).    Its not unheard of for people to beat cancer of any stage but all cancers grow at different speeds and respond to treatments differently so its impossible to give you a prediction over the internet. often much of the treatment depends on whether the cancers are in place where they can be removed and the organ to which theyve spread.|`|2lWvyMIjaa	http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:qHH...

CuVnpxh3aa	Milk of Magnesia, it comes in peppermint and cherry flavor and it works very well, no cramps at all. My bowels shut down 8 years ago from a digestive disorder and I stated taking laxatives to make them work. Milk of Magnesia was the best. My Dr finally prescribed a medication you have to get by prescription that works very well. Don't eat bananas, bananas are a binding food, you eat those when you have diarrhea. Other fruits are fine but no bananas. Oatmeal is good for fiber or wheat chex or raisin bran o bran flakes. Also shredded wheat is a good fiber food. Hope this helps.|`|qesIBFcHaa	well i suggest going to your pharmacist right away and asking what to do, or call your doctor.|`|r38RPpHcaa	lots and lots of fiber.|`|G0qsVfoUaa	Warm milk with molasses in it, banana, eat some high fibre foods too.

zddIYf9vaa	The human ear has three main sections, which consist of the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. Sound waves enter your outer ear and travel through your ear canal to the middle ear. The ear canal channels the waves to your eardrum, a thin, sensitive membrane stretched tightly over the entrance to your middle ear. The waves cause your eardrum to vibrate. It passes these vibrations on to the hammer, one of three tiny bones in your ear. The hammer vibrating causes the anvil, the small bone touching the hammer, to vibrate. The anvil passes these vibrations to the stirrup, another small bone which touches the anvil. From the stirrup, the vibrations pass into the inner ear. The stirrup touches a liquid filled sack and the vibrations travel into the cochlea, which is shaped like a shell. Inside the cochlea, there are hundreds of special cells attached to nerve fibers, which can transmit information to the brain. The brain processes the information from the ear and lets us distinguish between different types of sounds.|`|VkXv4RInaa	The ears themselves are like satellite dish antennas - the just direct sound waves into your ear drum where the vibrations are interpreted into sound|`|D9JVpmDVaa	uhmm, well you hear from them. sound goes in them...|`|4AgjfQTnaa	They allow us to hear sounds and communctae effectively.

I know I'm a nice person and I'm very loyal. It bugs me, but I do like myself. I love animals and might die someday saving a wild animal. I just have to remember that what other people think isn't important. At the end of the day I want to be proud of me and able to live with the choices I've made. I saved a Garr from dying in a puddle drying up on the side of the river and no one with me not even my boyfriend of 3 years wanted to help. All of the fisherman thought I was nuts. I'm also a small female. I got this mean, ugly and very heavy fish to the water and it turned around and looked back at me as to say thank you. I will never forget that.

lg2RfcrQaa	No you can't target weight loss. The pudgeyness could be because you're abit bloated. Cut out bread and sandwiches for a week and have a healthy salad for lunch instead and it'll make a big difference. Bread and cakes contain wheat which can make most people a bit bloaty.  Exercise is good too. It doesn't have to be anything strenuous. Just a nice long walk a couple of times a week can do a whole lot of good. Get yourself down to the gym if you can. Last year when I turned 16 I weighed 154lbs and did absolutely no exercise and ate rubbish constantly. Since then, I joined the gym and took up running. I decided to eat really healthily. I've lost 48lbs so that's just and idea of what you can achieve ;) I go to the gym everytime I'm free which usually works out 4x a week and I've gone from lazy to completely addicted to running! You'll definately get a flatter stomach with running.   Hope this helps!  x

p6pESvHDaa	Your body has adapted to your workout.  The last several years new studies and research have proven that the human body has several "survival mechanisms" built in.  One of those traits involves how the body handles physical fitness over time.    When you work out, it's like putting your body through a small car wreck, it's damaging the muscles (in a good way) so that they rebuild stronger. However your body doesn't know the difference between good and bad damage. So it adapts to what is occurring to prevent bad damage, but it also prevents the good damage.    You need to change your work out.  Instead of running for every cardio workout, try a high impact aerobics tape, try swimming, try intense bike riding, try an elliptical, just change it up.  Run for 2 cardio workouts a week, do something different for the rest.  Also combine a good calisthenics work out with your cardio days, this will help shape the muscles to give your body a stronger look and help offset how your body is adapting.    You are doing great, don't lose faith, you will reach your goal, just add some variety to the workouts, change it up every couple of days, and you'll see progress again.  Good Luck, and I know you can reach your goal.|`|MHvPewSmaa	try alternating the type of workout youre doing.  shock your system.  for example instead of running try an elliptical

23ea9912f910c6aeb7e7c3ce4bd5b488aa	Hi,    I decided to develop my own diet.  I wanted something simple and something that I could stick to.    My diet does not involve exercise (but you should exercise for HEALTH reasons).    Just make sure that you allow yourself to feel hungry for a while each day. The hunger sensation is caused by your body consuming your fat and so you should not try and mask this if you want to lose a bit of weight.    Be very careful though, you should never go below your recommended BMI.    Stephen Birchall  Author of "The Birchall Diet"|`|i7oGjwJBaa	It sounds like you're doing enough exercise if you're working out 5 days a week at school.  If you are tired after exercising, then you've done enough, or maybe too much.  A lot about exercise depends on your actual effort.  I can do the same workout and burn twice as many calories by putting my best effort into it, rather than just getting through it - you'll burn less.    Anyway, if you're getting that much exercise, you probably need to adjust your eating if you're not getting results.  There's a lot of info around about the best diet routine.. I say moderation, and if you really can't control it loosely - try keeping a food diary and counting calories.  Calories in VS calories out is really what matters - I also believe too much process foods (anything out of a box) and white flour and sugar will impead your health and weightloss, regardless of the calories you're taking in.  If you're really tired after exercise even though you're doing it every day... you should be building stamina, if you're not - you might not be eating enough.  The perfect snack after a hard workout is chocolate milk (organic if you can).  It has a great balance of protein and sugar to recoup after physical exertion.  good luck!|`|MKjrdfgCaa	Exercise and chew sugar free gum|`|iAKad98iaa	ok, save yourself some time, I have put together a list of websites that work and will help you lose weight quick and effective.    http://weight-loss-camps-for-adults.blog...  http://the-weight-loss-systems.blogspot....

Scab-picking is in a branch of O.C.D., though more closely related to Trichotillomania (hair-pulling... related in that it's a kind of innate "over-grooming", even if it doesn't seem to make sense).      It's not usually related to self-harm (like cutting, burning, etc.) because you aren't intending to "hurt" yourself, you're just doing something that others mis-perceive as the same family as self mutilation.

I'm not sure that any diet or exercise program will do what you want, although running and other exercises that target the lower extremities might be somewhat helpful. Also, in my experience most vegetarians are really "grainatarians" . Unfortunately grains are not the health foods they are cracked up to be and they are fattening. High quality animal protein, on the other hand, actually helps burn fat. So you might reconsider your dietary choices.    Having said that, most women with the problem you describe have a relative estrogen excess. (Low progesterone, high estrogen levels) and you may not be able to correct the problem unless you correct this condition. Fortunately there are some things you can do - starting with a saliva test to see what your hormone levels are.     I recommend seeing a physician trained in bio-identical hormone replacement therapy for help. You can find a link to a directory of such physicians on my website. Click on the "menopause" button - you'll find the link at the bottom of the  pages on estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in women.     Hope this helps.

People who are recovering from anorexia are often given zinc supplements to help them experience normal hunger again.    If you're eating 1200 calories per day, you will be burning up fat.  It doesn't really make a difference whether you feel hungry or not, the important thing is that you are burning more calories than you are eating.|`|5PatAvshaa	No I think that's your metabolism slowing down.

If you are eating junk food then your not going to drop weight as quickly.     20lbs in a month is asking a lot.

Try keeping a food journal for a week, so you can get a better idea of where you might need to alter your meals.     Add more cardio.

Good luck :)|`|tB7GkTi5aa	Hi. Weight Loss Doc here...    The weight training you've been doing is great but you might want to try short sessions of interval training rather than 30 minutes a day on the treadmill. Short intense exercise sessions are more effective at burning fat than medium or long duration  exercise sessions of moderate intensity.     Also, while exercise is critical for weight loss and for maintaining weight loss,  it's  difficult to lose weight through exercise alone. I don't recommend dieting or counting calories - EVER - but I do recommend paying attention to the types of food you eat and how much you eat at a time. High quality protein for instance increases satiety and has been shown to actually increase fat oxidation or fat burning.  Dairy products also seem to have this effect. On the other hand there are certain foods you want to avoid - particularly grains and grain products.    Also, while "fat-burning" pills may help a little with weight loss,  the extra weight loss achieved by most of these is in the range of 4-5 pounds. Nothing spectacular.     I have a lot more detailed information on these topics on my website   at www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.com if you are interested.

Also as far as affording meds, if he cant, many companys do have programs to supply meds to people with low income that cant afford them.....also many drs have lots of samples they will give you to help you out.....been there.  He should talk to his Dr about that.

If he's bipolar then he shouldn't even take an antidepressant without a mood stablilizer.    Perhaps consider an antipsychotic - it won't help his depression much but it'll calm him down some. My antipsychotics prevented most suicidal thoughts, rage, mania. He will still suffer from depression, but have a little calmer outlook to deal with it. Unfortunately, I don't know which ones are the cheapest, you'd have to figure that out yourself.

Tampons work just as well for girls who are virgins as they do for girls who have had sex. And even though using a tampon can occasionally cause a girl's hymen to tear, it does not cause a girl to lose her virginity. (Only having sex can do that.)    Whether a girl decides to use a tampon or a pad is completely up to her. Lots of girls who are active  particularly girls who swim  want to use tampons so they don't miss out on their favorite sport.    It may take some practice putting in a tampon for the first time. Some girls find that using a slender-size, applicator-style tampon (especially one with a rounded top) makes it easier at first. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the box. It also helps to try a tampon for the first time on a day when your period flow is heaviest. That way the tampon should slip in easier  |`|HuhI1IlJaa	it is possible to use tampons when u're a virgin and i've never heard of it doing anything to the parts|`|h6M4hajPaa	That's the craziest thing I ever heard.No I tampon cannot break your hymen.Only a penis can do that.If you want ACTUAL proof then next time you buy a box of tampons,look at the little pamphlet and there is info about a tampon.I've read it before and it actually says a tampon can't take your virginity.Look your mom just doesn't want you to wear tampons for some reason.Don't listen to her,kay?|`|CsbiReutaa	It's not true that you aren't supposed to use them before you have sex or that you have mangled your body parts.  She may be freaked out at the thought of you having something in "there".  My daughter is 13 and that's how I would feel.|`|BHfJ1myqaa	Yes it is true, my mother tells me the same thing, it's for our good because using tampons can cause you to get toxin poison, something you never want and something that you hardly hear people talk about, that doesn't mean that they don't have it. Just because it may work for one doesn't mean that it will work for you! LOL|`|qXe8z3lNaa	In all seriousness, you and your mom should make an appointment with a gynecologist and ask as many questions as needed in order to be more informed about your body. Also, perusing the web is also an appropriate means of deciding which type of product you should use during your periods. Being informed means being healthy AND comfortable in your skin your in!  And in regards to "mangled my body parts"...She should also make a concerted effort to educate herself in regards to her own body. She obviously has quite a few misconceptions in regards to sex, menstruation cycle, and young girls. I hope this opinion has helped ease some of your fears. Good luck and good health, young lassie!!|`|PnoFt5GDaa	Oh dear, this could be an innocent case of mum not wanting her little girl to grow up. My mum had a massive fit when I shaved my legs at 12, it's just a mum thing. Don't confront her or have a go, just leave it as long as she believes you and trusts you, then that's all that matters. A woman or girl who has started her periods can wear tampons without having had sexual intercourse and if they mangled your body parts, they simply wouldn't be sold! Read the leaflet with your tampons or search on the internet, your mum has panicked and his in turn unnecessarily scared you. You are right it is more convenient to wear tampons when going about your everyday life. They can however, break your hymen, which is usually broken during sex, but they can't take your virginity, only sex can do that. Even activities like horse riding can break your hymen, it's normal and really not an issue.

2fbc4577a4f542e03c37d2a54d131fd7aa	Absolutely Awesome!  Dialectical Behavioral Therapy was the most effective treatment I have experienced.  I've been an active pursuer of mental health since I was 16 years old; I'm on the down side of 48 and am in never-ending pursuit.  I was in a Masters & Johnson's Sexual Trauma Unit (X2) and was exposed first to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and was impressed with the results.  Then came the DBT and WOW, did it ever make sense.  I learned new ways to THINK, ways that worked-that opened my eyes to whole new perspectives, I learned that things weren't nearly as dramatic as I had tended to see them in the past. I learned that the past is a fixed thing no matter how badly I wished to "go back and redo things" it was NEVER EVER going to happen.  I did learn however, that I, that anyone could change their own personal attitudes and thoughts if they were of a mind  to.  My favorite part? EMPOWERMENT! I have the power to change my thoughts and NO ONE is entitled to make my decisions or determine my reality or worth.  Stick with it as best as you can and remember to collect and compile any and all handouts and notes, they will come in handy on down the road.

The easiest way to get better at anything is to do it over and over again, until it becomes hardwired into your schema. If you want to simply increase reps, do a lot of them. If you want to max out, here is the best way: get an empty barbell, do ten reps. Add 20kgs and do 1 rep and rest twenty seconds. Increase the weight by twenty kilos every set of one rep and rest for the same amount of seconds as weight on the stack until you can't do one anymore. Then rest for however many seconds you have weight on the bar and drop the weight by twenty five percent(estimate). Do this weight in sets of 10 for 5 sets for two weeks of training and then increase the weight by 10%. Keep up the program and you will be benching double your body weight in a month dude!|`|AA11167091	Your brain.  Seriously.    Your body isn't made up of just one muscle, so you need to be smart and train your whole body.  Look at all of the muscles involved in bench pressing:  Chest, triceps, shoulders; to a lesser extent biceps, back, abs, forearms.  Why focus on just one of those in particular?  Ask any serious weightlifter, bodybuilder or powerlifter and they'll tell you the same thing:  Work your whole body out hard!    Do not neglect your legs!  I see so many people in the gym that never, ever do one leg exercise and their numbers eventually plateau.  Meanwhile, mine keep going up and up.    Google 'Bill Starr' and follow his routine.  Follow that for a few months (and make sure your diet in dialed in) and I'll guarantee you'll see very signifcant improvement.

As far as beyond that, likely you would do well to find a therapist with knowledge of people who face attachment issues.  This means the therapist should have a good working knowledge of attachment theories.    Other trauma based therapies such as EMDR, somatic experiencing, etc. would likely be helpful as well because they activate the right brain (emotional side of relating).

KAyVeRezaa	That guy must have a strong chest. The further the grip the more it works the chest and the closer the grip the more it works the triceps. It's good to find a happy medium that's comfortable to work both muscle groups efficiently.     For chest press or bench press, the chest does most of the work to lift off the weight and the triceps lock out the arms to complete a repetition.   You'll notice that people who have strong triceps have no problem locking out their arms when they tire.

bafba0d7944b755f0f32244881386872aa	Getting started  ...on jogging and running    Advice from Windmilers coach Olwen Seear          Click as appropriate, depending on your level of fitness.     for the totally unfit person   if you are reasonably fit   warm up and stretch   advice for the unfit  (Firstly, it is recommended that you check with your doctor before embarking on any form of exercise). Illness does not have to be an obstacle, many runners are asthmatic, diabetic, suffer from Crohns disease, IBS, high blood pressure, Alzheimers, etc and running can also ease the pain/trauma of cancer for some runners.    Anyone can run and improvement is possible for anyone who tries. And, you dont have to be young  some runners in the Windmilers didnt take up running until their late fifties  so age is no excuse. However, you do need to walk before you can run, so use the following programme for guidance.    Wear loose fitting clothes and proper running shoes. There are many shoes on the market to cater for all types of bio-mechanical faults (pronation, supination, irregular leg lengths, etc). It is important to wear shoes with adequate cushioning and support and these shoes should be used for running only, not for wearing in the gym or for walking around in. They should not be worn every day because the cushioning gets compressed when you run in them and 24-36 hours ideally are needed for them to decompress before you wear them again. Therefore, if and when you run more regularly it would be a good idea to invest in two or three pairs so that you can alternate. Shoes also only have a life span of 500-600 miles before the cushioning wears out. Most injuries arise because runners continue to run in their old shoes.     Before you start your walk/jog you need to prepare your body for what it is about to do. Gently mobilise the joints by following the examples in the table at the end of this document. This releases a synovial fluid, making movement easier around the joints (like oiling a car). You then need to warm the body before stretching, as stretching cold can cause a muscle to tear, so follow the instructions below to warm up. If you have never stretched before, hold each warm up stretch for about 5 seconds. When you become fitter you can hold each warm up stretch for up to 10 seconds. These stretches prepare the muscles for the work they are about to do. Over-stretching before exercise can also cause injury, so be careful. Following your run it is important to stretch again, but this time to hold on to each stretch a little longer, as this increases flexibility.    And off you go...  week no. Tuesday Thursday Sunday   1 Walk 10 minutes Walk 10 minutes Walk 10 minutes   2 Walk 12 minutes Walk 10 minutes Walk 12 minutes   3 Walk 10 minutes briskly Walk 15 minutes Walk 12 minutes briskly   4 Walk 15 minutes briskly Walk 12 minutes briskly Walk 15 minutes briskly   5 Walk 20 minutes easy Walk 15 minutes briskly Walk 20 minutes briskly   6 Walk 20 minutes briskly Walk 20 minutes briskly Walk 20 minutes briskly   7 Walk and jog 10 minutes Walk and jog 10 minutes Walk and jog 10 minutes   8 Walk and jog 10 minutes Walk and jog 12 minutes Walk and jog 15 minutes     When walking briskly, swing the arms and stride out, so that you feel the body heating. When you start jogging, this should be like a shuffle. Dont run too fast. Dont hold your breath (most beginners try to hold on to their breath for as long as they can and then collapse). Concentrate on breathing out on, say, every second right step. Concentrate on breathing out more than in, because you will always have enough oxygen going in to your body. Breathing out releases toxins from your body and helps the circulation work more efficiently. Some runners sweat more than others and some lose large amounts of discharge from their noses  neither have anything to do with fitness levels, so if you find either of these happening with you, dont let it discourage you.    Aim to jog from, say, one tree to the next, or a litter bin or lamp post until you eventually run the whole distance without walking (and you will if you persevere). Keep the arms low and relaxed. Try not to tense the shoulders and neck (common with beginners).    If you get a stitch, this is probably due to using muscles in the diaphragm that you dont normally use. If this happens, squeeze the thumbs tightly and carry on walking. Concentrating hard on squeezing the thumbs encourages the muscles in the diaphragm to relax. A stitch can also be brought on by eating too soon before exercise so try not to eat for 2-3 hours before commencement.    You will need to increase your intake of water (think of what happens to your car if it runs out of water, your body will react in a similar way and leave you feeling exhausted). You will also need to increase your intake of carbohydrates (just as your car needs fuel to keep going) in the form of potatoes, pasta, rice, bread, etc. Protein (cheese, eggs, meat, etc) which is needed to replenish the muscles after exercise. Try to cut down on your fat intake (biscuits, crisps, sweets, etc). Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables.     Repeat the above cycle (Weeks 1 - 8) with a mixture of jogging and walking until you can run three times a week for 20 minutes without walking. You will then be fit enough to come along to the Sunday Social run at 10am, where you will gain encouragement and advice from other runners. Continuing with the schedule, you should increase each run as in Weeks 1-8 by 5 minutes. If you feel you can start jogging earlier on in the schedule, then do so, following the advice above.    advice for the reasonably fit  If you are reasonably fit, you can start your running programme at what would be week 7 for the unfit, treating this as week 1. Using the same principle, keep r|`|bf298556d13429a58d34ccce33e0a96faa	Warm up-stretch  Run for about five minutes at a moderate pace, then check your pulse, it should be at 70-80% of your max.

wi6mkT30aa	This is such a good question, because I just think it is so ridiculous that a none married woman, living at home with her parents, with 6 babies all under the age of SEVEN should NOT even be allowed to try to get pregnant again by a Dr. who implants the embryos. IT should be illegal!    I personally felt happy when I heard about the Octuplets I thought wow what a miracle! Now, I just think it's sad that these children are coming in to the world with a woman that is not prepared.     (This has nothing to do with single mothers, my mom was a single mom as well and she did her best. We didn't have much but she was smart enough to just have one child and take care of her responsibilities!)      This woman is now getting a "Free Ride" in the system for having Octuplets, and it's just crazy! She's going to get so many things for free and YES at first I thought this was great but until I found out she is just have babies after babies after babies on no good Solid ground, I'm just taken back and disappointed!    In this case i think the Dr needs to pay, why should we? She MADE this choice to have children who she clearly can't take care of.     I was wondering WHY she was so private about this! Now we all know, she's a careless person that is just having children for the wrong reasons. She needs to watched. Seriously how can a YOUNG woman take care of 14 children ON HER OWN without a husband and a home of her own. She doesn't deserve to even have these poor kids, but I'm sure the system or goverment or SOMEBODY out there will baby her and buy her a new home, clothing, dipars, toys...the things are listless!      This really makes me sick!    They said that she has  6 children ages 7,6,5,4 and 2 year old twins. They told her after she got pregnant with Octuplets to abort most of them but a few, I think that is just sad on the doctors! They should have talked about that BEFORE this even ahppened and didn't even allow her to do such a thing! Just sad!

VsxC8pZSaa	I hear it is quite hard for the skinny guys to gain muscle mass for a number of reasons.    This course is extremely popular amongst skinny bodybuilders though it may help you!    http://skinny-muscles.1001-solutions.inf...|`|ZGReKpK6aa	Are you adding enough carbohydrates to your diet?? Your muscles need a combination of things to grow. Consistently feeding your muscles with protein and carbohydrates will help. Also , rest days are important also. Try alternating your workout days and go easier on the cardio. Hope this helps.
7532035b5814c446a2ae6b23cc1f6519aa	A healthy vagina shouldn't smell gross. Yes, it'll have a musky smell, but it should never be offensive.  If it is, you need to make sure that you're eating a healthy diet, cleaning yourself thoroughly (washing your lips with a mild soap and drying thoroughly, no douching or cleaning inside your hole, it'll clean itself out) and wearing cotton underwear so you don't trap sweat and your vagina should breath... Each person has a different smell, some are sweet, some are more musky, but its not bad. |`|3RxLzRBQaa	The smell is actually dependent on the bacteria that grow there and feed off of your nonsmelling sweat. Seriously, sweat does not smell, but he by-products bacteria make off of feeding off the sweat does. Therefore, you can blame the smell on the bacteria!! |`|5OOzU5foaa	Thats life as a women for ya|`|7yh5So2Caa	You may not like the smell of your vagina, but it should not smell "gross". It's a warm moist place, bacteria love it down there. If it smells too bad, you may have a minor infection. Vaginitis or yeast. Also eating onions or garlic can alter our fluid smells. Sweat smells gross, as well as urine, and have you ever smelled a guys balls after being in jeans all day? Anyway wipe yourself well after using the bathroom and even take another sheet of paper to wipe where your legs and vagina come together. If that doesn't help see a doctor just to make sure. You might just be being too self conscious! The average smelling vagina doesn't seem to bother men. After all, they are the ones supposed to be attracted to the scent anyway.|`|AA10102392	It's another part of life that doesn't make sense (among many!) However, the smell should be musky but not horrid. If it is really bad, then it might be a cleanliness issue or some other problem.|`|PIphNeTeaa	Only a nasty dirty sweaty one or a sick one stinks. A clean turned on one is one of the best smells in the world.|`|MLc8OSQiaa	I agree with chrystal... everyone has a different smell...if your's is HORRIBLE you might also have a yeast infection. but its pretty normal to have an odor down there i mean, there's folds of skin that get wet and humid from sweat and hormones.. its gonna smell somewhat...lol|`|16bWGB14aa	If it smells really bad you should call your doctor. You might have an infection.|`|lqxTD0E5aa	What do you expect in a warm, wet place?  And anyway, a vagina shouldn't smell really terrible.

4HQxLXQCaa	Sumnor is somewhat misinformed.    you DO have enough fat on you to partially cover your abs.   You DO have underdeveloped muscles. I agree with him on this.  It is possible you just have bad genetics where fat covering your abs is stubborn.  This isn't the norm though.  Everybody HAS A SIX PACK ALREADY!  Look in a medical anatomy book.  Every human on the planet has a six pack.  The thing is, the vast majority have fat covering them.      "which is stupid because I see retardedly skinny kids at the pool all the time with no abs."  That's because those kids kids are skinny-fat.  They look skinny because they have little muscle mass.  You can't see their abs because they are covered over in fat.  Just because you don't have a pot belly does not mean you have no fat on your stomach.    I really recommend you gain some muscle first throughout your entire body.  Do some freeweight barbell squats and deadlifts.  It's more impressive and healthier to have low body fat when you have higher muscle mass.  If you lost some fat right now, you would have a six pack no doubt, but it wouldn't look like bodybuilder abs and you wouldn't have a very impressive body elsewhere.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	WOW. You are 5'10 and 135 pounds, you do not have enough fat on you to completely cover your abs. You just have underdeveloped muscles. They won't show through if you don't work them unless you have good ab genetics, despite all the people who constantly yell that everyone has abs beneath their fat, which is stupid because I see retardedly skinny kids at the pool all the time with no abs.
ItJzrvQ4aa	Tips for Decreasing your Appetite Drink plenty of water, at least eight glasses a day for proper hydration   Eat green, leafy vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, fish and poultry in small portions   Limit sugar, alcohol, protein, dairy products, salt, caffeine and refined white flour products such as pasta   Drink lemonade with real lemon juice  lemon juice contains citrate   Exercise regularly, physical activity helps to remove the stone   Increase your intake of magnesium and Vitamin B6 supplements|`|3d1XRIzkaa	when you eat, take small bites and chew your food slowly. While chewing your food, put your fork down on the table. That way you are not putting more food into your mouth, while still chewing your food. Between meals, if you get hungry, eat some dry cereal, like cheerios, Frosted Mini-Wheats, or Cheerios.|`|4HQxLXQCaa	Drink a lot of water.  But remember that the body is asking for food for a reason.  It needs fuel.  If you are hungry (legitimately, not just bored or emotional or something) then you should really eat.    Eat very slow so your body registers when you are hungry.  Eat small meals frequently (5/6 meals) instead of 3 big meals.    You can always just exercise more and eat the same amount or a little more.  Technically you will be eating more, but your hunger will be satisfied and you won't be gaining fat.

Also Yoga will help shed some pounds as well as long you do it 2-3 times a day. I would preffer going to a gym like 24 if you really want to lose some weight and gain muscle.

ZyMv49qxaa	Honestly my first reaction would be of fear.  I would be very concerned about the welfare of my child and want to do whatever it is that needs to be done to help him/her feel better.  If a child seems happy enough and doesn't speak of feeling sad why is he/she seeing a psychologist?  Something else is going on here because usually there is something going on if a kid is in counseling at a young age.  If the child is hospitalized use the staff at the hospital to help you and the child communicate better.  I can understand why some parents might feel angry and frustrated that their child confided these feelings to someone other than them.  Being sad and confused are also understandable.  It is sad when a parent finds out their child is suicidal and certainly confusing if there seems to have been no signs.  |`|HJSN2V0taa	I would be wary of the doctor and try to have a discussion with my "child".    During the teen years, stress & anxiety are normal feelings, as well as suicidal thoughts...it's the end of childhood, and the beginning of an "unknown" cycle of life...it can be a very scary, stressful & painful time      do/did the parent(s) ever try to sit down and actually talk about their life experiences?     I would definitely be skeptical and at the very least, want a second opinion from another psychologist.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Pink Panther,     Perhaps 10-20 years ago, i could understand parents to be confused, angry as depression was not very well understood. Sad, well its kind of normal to feel sad when your children are not feeling well, whatever it is, a cold, they fell off their bike, they lost their favorite teddy bear.     But I can understand you in a way .. I mean parents or anyone actually cannot truly understand someone depressed. Its very unique to each of the depressed person.     Your parents and most likely yourself as well need to really look into more what depression is. You might want to print this out for your parents, things to say and not to say to someone depressed or make your own list ( it makes it more personalized)   http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

Rather than stopping entirely, try tapering off your intake. Drink slightly less first, and then less again. This should make you less dependent on the stuff.|`|YhYapmbIaa	That means you are addited to caffeine. What you need to do is stop it slowly, it is like any other addiction, thank God not as serious as smoking or doing some dangerous drugs. What you do need to know is the reason for it, I used to drink too much caffeine too and it was just because I had been doing it for a long time, since when I was a kid and I also think it had something to do with my dificult childhood and adolescence, my family was very abusive and coffee addiction I guess subconsciously was my way of controling something, I don't know.   NOW from drinking too much caffeine I start having a heart problem, known as Cardiac arrhythmia, it is when your heart starts beatting out of control. Like everything in your body, your heart is controlled by your brain, and your brain tells your heart to beat a certain ammount of times per minute, when you drink to much caffeine, your heart starts pumping out of control and your brain can no longer control how many time it beats. You brain starts sending signals for your hart to beat like 80 times per minute but the caffeine in your blood makes your heart beat more, in my case an astounding 250 times a minute! Tha can lead to cardiac arrest because the heart is out of control, it is like when a person does coke, in a coke overdoase case, your heart beats too many times causing your heart to go into cardiac arrest and your brain to swell up, and the brain looking for space because it no longer fits in your craimun presses against the top of the spinal cord, the bone marrow I think is what it presses against, so you won't have oxygen to breath, no blod being pumped to your body and you die. From what I understand, that is what happens in a coke overdose and from what I know hun, that is what can happen if you drink too much caffeine, your body will go crazy, your heart will pump out of control, and you will feel short of breath, because there isn't enough pxygen from your blood pumping too fast I think.   I did this exam once where they monitore your heart for I think it was 24 hours and the doctor told me, ohwell he told my family... " Her heart beat so fast during the night, while she was sleeping that I don't how how, why she didn't die!" After that my family cut caffeine from my diet, I wasn't drinking coffee, I was drinking tea, herbal tea, that was planted in someone's backyard, a neighboor andthey allowed me to take a few leaves so I would stock them for a while and make tea out of it everyday. But it was COMPLETELY organic, no caffeine, no drugs, it was tea made from the leaves planted in the backyard, so no caffeine at all!   Now that I quit caffeine, the funny thng is that I get sick when I have too much caffeine, I usually drink decaf, one cup a day and even that makes me sick sometimes, it makes me feel light headed, and like I am going to pass out because my body is clean and I think I got some kind of alergy to it, I don't know. Anywhose girly, you need to quit. Caffeine overdose can lead to death, and I am NOT in any way saying that you have a serious addiction to it but I am saying that you are in my opinion addicted and it is getting to be a serious addiction.   Quit little by little, if you drink 3 cups a day, han drink 2, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and during the day try to have some tea, or water, I don't think you are drinking enough water either, that is one of the things that happen to people who drink to much caffeine, they stop drinking water, cause your body doesn't feel the need for water anymore. I also think you drink redbull, which equals to 2 or more shots of caffeine, I used to do that too, so you can cut down to less redbull, but tryto cut down because you need to!!! For your life, you need to.   Now, when I have too much sugar and too much caffeine, or caffeine before I go to sleep, I can't sleep, my body keeps on jerking, little jumps in bed, because two cups of coffee is one too many. So try to quit, because it is dangerous, when something you do during the day gets to a point that you need it in order to feel okay,to go on your day, it is an addiction and it is not healthy to be dependant on something. I found these links that will help you with more info on caffeine and caffeine overdose. Cutting on it slowly will make the addiction and the need for it to g away in a better, easier way and will also make the headaches go away, it is because you are still giving your body caffeine, but your ody is getting less than before, if you do have the headaches you can try Camomile tea, organic Camomile tea, that helps calm you down and helps headaches go away. It is actually a homeopathic medicine for headache and it works like a charm! Actually cutting caffeine with camomile tea, cutting coffee with camomile tea is a great way to cut down on caffeine! No headaches!!! Hope this helped!!!   Love   Pearl    A Former Caffeine addict!|`|MS0WHTUnaa	Too much of anything is bad for you. And every drug has a side effect and some feel it more than others.

You said they are actual THOUGHTS, not dreams- correct?  If this is the case and your brother is concerned, his mother should listen to his fears and concerns and have him evaluated- something has happened to cause him to have extreme violent thoughts.  If she refuses to folllow through, you might talk to a school counselor about your concerns- they may be able to call your parents in for a meeting and suggest an evaluation for your brother.  A suggestion from a school professional may cause them to take it more seriously.

Good Luck.|`|f08cdab9e2c1a31c572dcf3f40cf9bfcaa	If neither parent will step up, talk to a counsulor at school or something. Get your brother some kind of outside help. Maybe he would feel comforatble talking to a minister or pastor. Then again maybe it will help your brother if you talked him through it rather than a complete stranger who would be pick away at his brain.

Tell him he can talk to the social worker at his school about these issues and he or she may be able to advocate for him.    Also, as far as what you can do, you can try reading him comforting stories at bedtime (a good one for kids who have had trauma is The Stars Will Still Shine).  Talk to him about TV and the difference between fantasy/ imagination and reality.  Remind him of his safety and that you are there for him.|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Well, there is nothing YOU can do.

Without the cooperation of your parents, there's very little you can do to help your brother.     You need to sit down with your mother and explain, in the same detail you did in your question, just what is going on with your brother. Just because he's 10 does not mean he can't be dangerous to himself or others.     The child needs help and fast.

Just be sure to use protection if you become sexually active, cuz even without a period you can get pregnant once you've had your first cycle.

I was 13 when i started and i'm 15 now and my periods are still irregular.    Its natural and will keep happening until your horomones settle down, so don't worry about it.    Other reasons could be you have irregular weight gain and loss, but thats very rare. It is mostly down to horomones and all things like that, so i wouldn't worry.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	There is no reason why you can't use a hot water bottle as a warm compress against your stomach if you have period pain. I am not sure why your Auntie told you this. Many women find a hot water bottle helps to relieve cramps.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	i dont know why    i always use a hot water bottle and it helps with the pain :(|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	you can.....just be careful not to leave it on too long or have it in direct contact with your skin as you could get a heat rash.|`|8tdlP1rOaa	A hot bottle for what??? a heating pad?   it could just be one of those old wives tales.|`|jkDawQVNaa	i do and it makes the cramps go away idk why she would say no. just keep on your socks to|`|CHlxBbkHaa	I have and it helped.  Cramps don't release with cold... so you apply heat.  Use the hot water bottle if you want and if it doesn't help you then don't bother with it next time.  Everyone has different bodies and they don't all react the same.|`|24rBuTqOaa	i use a heating pad when I'm at home.    i don't see why you couldn't use a hot water bottle...sept for they're kind of obsolete now. just go buy a heating pad.    and they have those portable heating pad things now, ThermaCare, they stick to your body and last for like 8 hours. I love those things.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I have never heard that. I often use a hot water bottle when I have cramp on my period as I think the heat helps. It must be an old wives tale.|`|fRl0O2XYaa	What  i always use a hot water bottle i think you can..  im in so much pain anyway that i wouldnt notice anything so..  i dont know google it maybe?  x|`|z3TIcyI6aa	For those of you who can't figure out why she would have a hot water bottle and not an electric pad. Here's why.  She's probably from the UK and electricity is much more expensive here than in the USA. Blankets can also be left on too long or forgotten about and are not always safe to use long term not to mention the fact that if every person in the house used one regularly and left them on a lot it could be a waste of electricity and become expensive.    Using hot water bottles is NOT outdated at all. In fact many people still use them in their homes and a lot!  All you need to to boil the kettle with just a small amount of water and pour into the hot water bottle! Eventually it goes cold so can be left in your bed without using up the elec or putting yourself in danger of staring fires. Elderly people are often warned about the dangers of leaving them on and forgetting about them!  Yes there are newer heating pads with less dangers but nothing beats a good old hot water bottle which doesn't need as much electricity!    My American friend was recently over and had a very bad period and I offered her a hot water bottle. She said she had never heard of one or seen one but found she was very comforted by it and said she'd like one for home rather than the elec blanke/padt she would normally use LOL      Anyway as others have said it's fine, just make sure you keep the cover on to stop you getting heat rash!  Always works for me!|`|T6VePfb4aa	hot water bottle for wat?|`|1CQISjMIaa	Because it makes all the blood come faster.|`|cnf5ZVpUaa	i dunno what she meant? I use them to get rid of the pain by laying it on my abdomen, because it helps the muscles relax. It helps. But if there's a serious health-issue caused by it, i haven't heard of it yet, and i studied medicine.|`|RzshcPfOaa	you can use hotwater bottle ,there is no reason not too,swear by it.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	No reason at all why you shouldn't, provided it is appropriately protected so that you do not burn your skin.|`|R6IYY4miaa	I use heating pads, and it doesn't do anything bad, so I wouldn't worry about it.|`|96mkEwkwaa	I dont see why you shouldnt use one?? it would be like using a heating pad and women have been using those for cramps for a good while now|`|83GG2y8gaa	what??!!  use a heating pad!
BIRIWf7raa	Not in that short amount of time you can't. But you if you try really hard and be on a strict diet, you can probably lose up to 10 lbs. But don't expect a lot more than that, anymore than that isn't healthy.
el8yX5q3aa	I know isnt' that sad?  Eating healthy is HARD....it can be expensive.        * A cup of rice and a vegetarian stir-fry      * Replace soda with water      * Pasta primavera      * Fruitshakes/smoothies      * Cheese and crackers      * Nuts      * Beans (flavored with a little meat)      * Fruits and vegetables    Learning to eat (and prepare) more meals at home is an excellent way to reduce your food budget and eat healthfully. Find a source of recipes that you trust and learn to prepare them. (Heres a good online recipe page that features many cheap and healthy meals.)     You can save money and still have quality. If youve been using cost as an excuse to eat junk, you can kiss that excuse goodbye! With a little organization and creativity, you can have the proverbial champagne when cooking on a beer budget. To start, heres a quick review of basic tips of healthy eating:        * Limit your intake of junk food and alcohol      * Drink lots of water (at least 8 cups a day)      * Limit salty and sugary foods      * Avoid eating many foods that are high in saturated fats      * Make variety the watchword of your eating    Next, set aside regular blocks of time for planning meals, making your grocery list, and shoppingtasks that are most often shortchanged in food prep. Include healthy snack ideas, as well as main menu items. Think about the time of day, day of week, and even week in the month that you shop. Generally, the grocery is the least busy early in the morning, in the middle of the week, and on any day but the first day or two of the month (when many people receive pension or paychecks).    Try getting a rotisserie chicken and skin it..and half it.  YOu can use that for two meals...use the other half in a casserole or stir fry or salad for the next day.    Go to a fresh market for your veggies.  I live near amish country and go there for my veggies. I can get four squash for 3 dollars and that is good for several meals....cabbage one dollar a head...celery 50 cents for a whole thing....peppers...a basket for 1 dollar...etc.  Maybe you have something like that near you!    You can make soups and stir frys and you don't have to add meat or add a LOT of meat...just a little is good.    I make my own broth and stock out of chicken bones and beef bones....and it is much cheaper and better than store bought.  You can freeze it too and freeze it in ice cube trays and take one cube and use that for oil when stir frying etc.....less fat and more flavor.    To eat healthy it means preparation and cooking from scratch too....and that is time consuming.  But if you love to cook like I do..it is more therapy than work.    here aer some sites with great recipes..    http://www.menus4moms.com/articles/eatin...    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17113255/    http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/health...    http://www.netmums.com/h/n/FOOD/HOME/ALL...    http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/healthinf...    http://www.stepfamily.asn.au/cooking/ind...      http://www.wellsphere.com/healthy-eating...    You can google more..there are tons of sites out there with healthy eating on low budgets.|`|oojO4WAraa	Most people don't need as much food as they eat.  You can buy plenty of healthy food and stay within your budget.  Dried beans are really cheap, and nutritious, low in calories and high in protein.  Always buy produce that is on sale.  Some things are always cheap - like baby carrots.   Buy frozen veggies when they are on sale.  You can cut your meat consumption in half - meat isn't necessary or that good for you.  When making spaghetti or tacos, use half the meat that is called for and add a whole pile of onions and green peppers.  |`|898f20a257695abc9115e62cda6828e3aa	Become a vegetarian and shop at a produce market where vegies are cheaper.  Thats what I do.|`|kl8tBBSQaa	beans are a healthy cheap food. so are fresh veggies and nuts. the thing is that like frozen "healthy" foods and prepackaged "healthy" foods are more expensive because manufacturers know that americans as a whole basically want to thinner and are dieting constantly so they are able to make money off of it |`|IRA2g5THaa	You are right it is more expensive to eat healthy but I think taking care of your body should be  1 so do the best you can to buy the good stuff.  Just look for the produce that is on sale for the week.  Alot of times grapes, berries, oranges etc. will be on sale.  Also, banana's and veggies are cheap.  Buying organic is important but if you can't right now at least buy the ones that may be on sale. Also, you can get frozen organic mixed veggies very cheap.  |`|6UQ8IFXLaa	Here are a few things you can make or buy:    Peanut butter/Sarabeth's Jam on 7 grain/honey bread    Subway roast chicken on Honey oat bread $5 footlong for two meals.    Wendy's mandarin chicken salad with sesame dressing.    McDonald's skillet burrito for two meals.  $3    Dairy Queen chicken salad under $5.    Texas Roadhouse one-third slab BBQ ribs and two sides (beans and baked potato)   $12 for 3 light meals.    I Hop three chicken crepes (breast made with spinach and hollandaise sauce)  $7 for 2 light meals.    Luby's Cafeteria:  buy 3 sides you like to accompany your light meals.|`|XNRIqHLPaa	5 dollar footlong lol|`|CB9yx71faa	In what respect you might mean 'healthy' can vary, so if you opt for products that are packaged specifically as 'low fat' or 'calorie free' there status as healthy is questionable due to other additives put in to make the product taste better. They can often cost more. If you want to eat organic, it will cost more due to higher food production costs.     My personal advice to you would be to read up a little bit about nutrition, so that you are clear in your own head that you understand what foodstuffs are good for us and why. The GI  diet is a particularly healthy way of eating (it is not necessary to follow it as a diet to lose weight), and gives you an understanding of why these foods work well.    I don't believe eating healthily has to cost more. here is an example of changes you might make, and they needn't cost more...    Breakfasts - drop the sugary cereals and buy porridge oats instead  Lunch - canned tuna and sweetcorn on wholemeal bread  Dinner - a portion of protein (be it fish, rabbit, beef, lamb, bean casserole etc) with some veg or salad.    Meats like lamb are about as 'free-range' as you can buy.    Avoid pre-packaged muck which is expensive and full of additives. Go to a proper butcher and get quality but less expensive cuts of meat (they are qualified to advise you on this), buy veg and fruit at source or at Farmer's Markets to get the best quality without paying the prices of going through an unscrupulous middle-man (i.e. the supermarkets).  Make big pots of veggie soups, casseroles, etc and in large batches and freeze as potions for convenience.    You can do it, but it will take a bit of thinking about in the early stages. Note that frozen fish (not the breadcrumbed/sauced varieties) and veg is still really good and packed with vitamins too.    good luck in your effort.|`|AA11205234	Thats the whole point rich stays and poor be gone! Statistics show that rich people are healthier than poor well duhhhhhh thats how the society wants it ...wanna be healthy give me all you got!  Sorry got a little carried away!  Dont eat out!

ZcovejOkaa	It's ok mate, it just means that you either went in a bit too deep, or was doing it at the wrong angle etc. I used to use toys and if I got too rough with myself I would get the same thing. It goes away though. Despite what other people have said on here it's totally ok for you to masturbate your girlfriend as long as she agrees of course, but keep asking her if she likes what you are doing, and if she seems in pain try to use a slightly different angle. When my boyfriend does it certain angles seem to hit a nerve and send pains down my leg, and if he tilts the wrong way it gives me the tummy pains.  Good luck.

vjB64bqcaa	Acai berries are a newly discovered berry from south america that has some amazing characteristics. The acai berry is high in anti-oxidants and really helps people loose weight . There are lots of health advantages to acai berries, but they must be frozen right after harvest to make sure they retain thier maximum potency.

I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site I got it from was theweight lossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

But as you take a small amount of it, or make  a small amount up into juice, you don't actually consume a lot of calories.    It's a fantastic supplement - not a miracle cure, but I reckon it's really good for you. Be careful of some of the scams out there, though, buy with care!

On my chart it says to determine you frame size wrap your fingers around your wrist and if they touch you have a medium frame, if they don't touch you have a large frame and if they overlap you have a small frame.   I went on a diet through my doctor and at first it said I had a medium frame but once I started losing weight I could overlap my fingers so I guess that meant I had a small frame and fat wrist. I hope this helps you. I'm not sure though where this chart fits in relation to age though. If it's for every one or just adults.
Sl6POx1Caa	Your husband is dealing with two sources of stress:    1. Stress incurred while on tour in Iraq.     2. Stress from readjusting to life at home.      Both of these sources are different forms of culture shock. The first shock included a harsh cold culture that possibly included death and destruction. The second shock includes a culture of softness and a wife. His mind is having a difficult time translating between the two cultures. It is important that you show him love and be very patient and understanding. Be an example for him to follow. Don't force him to go to counseling. Don't even ask him to go. Go to counseling by yourself instead. Talk to the counselor about what you are dealing with. Talk about how to change your behavior and attitude to ease your husband back into the softness of married life. Eventually, your husband may go with you and begin to work on adjusting to this new culture at home.|`|AA11280073	Call the VA and ask for help. Go with him to his appt. and tell them what's going on.

It's difficult.  Did you know there is a support group at most VA's once a month for wives.  I would look into it.  You need support to, it's almost like the death of a spouse for you in a way.  It's hard, watch your finances closely as sometimes it can eek into that area as well.    Go to the appointments with him, or call and speak to the counselor ahead of time.  It takes a team effort.  My brother is now having the same problems since Iraq as well.     There are a lot of PTSD meds out the, the doctors tend to try and start with antidepressants which often help some but not enough.  My husband has gulf war illness that hampers his breathing so he isn't able to take the PTSD drugs that would be more helpful.  But if your husband is healthy than he should be able to take them.    You husband may not be telling the Doctor's and counselors the whole truth as he isn't able to see it outside of himself.  Keep track of his symptoms, this way you have an accurate tracker of how he is doing.  It can also help you track triggers, what makes it worse is there a pattern, etc.      In a loving way, when he is not in a big irritable mood, tell him  you view this as a partnership that you want to help him through this.  That it's not just effecting him, but effects you just as much.  Hopefully viewing it as a partnership, were in this together may help.  It's a lot of work and things will never be the same, exactly but they can still be good. Working through it may bring you closer.       I wish you the best!  Understanding that his brain chemistry is forever changed is hard, not just for him but for you as well.  He's not doing it on purpose, but that doesn't give him the right to be hurtful.  You really need to try and put your foot down about that, let him know you won't go there with him.  He needs to find a way to express himself without being verbally abusive.  When my husband forgets I shut him off right there, with I will not talk about this until you can do so without being hurtful..  That helps remind him.  If he doesn't have some sort of planner he needs one, this way he can help remind himself of his appointments.  You don't want to be trapped as the bad guy or his mother.  He needs to learn to recognize missing appointments is part of avoidant behavior.      Talk to his counselor, because they probably have no clue about what is really going on at home.  My heart goes out to you and I hope together you can get through this.        |`|YO1w7gpiaa	My best advice is to begin by "documenting" in a notebook the symptoms that you see , and the appointments that he misses.  After a month or two, armed with your documentation, have a conversation with either the VA Counselor, or the psychiatrist who prescribed the meds.    Write down specific questions you have about how to get him treated for his PTSD.  Explain how it affects the family, and how he's changed.   You need answers, and you need advice on how to deal with this situation.       Nobody else is going to do this for him.    Extra sleeping can be because the dosage has not been adjusted to what is minimal.  In other words, too much can make a person sleep.    |`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Marceia,     Here is something for you to read.

I've had numerous problems in the past with cyst, fibroids and finally endometriosis which caused my periods to be like this too.

I got into this when a product called OPC 3 got rid of my asthma.  Now I study health & nutrition..I live a much happier life..  Another suggestion is to stregthen your immune system so your body can work properly.  That is exactly what that OPC 3 stuff does.  Imagine having aweful asthma then one day you start taking this purple stuff in a bottle & no more inhalers or asthma ever again!  It was life changing for me....I was sick & tired of being sick & tired!!

eFEyhBihaa	@lauralyn - ooooh someone's getting satirical =P  Though to be quite honest, hang around guys who are responsible enough to use prevention..?    There are a group of muscles at the base of your penis (though the penis itself is just spongy tissue).  They are the ones that control your peeing - they're the PC muscles.  Collectively there are a group of muscles called the Pelvic Floor muscles going from the base of your penis, along towards your anus.    You can do "kegel exercises" which are basically just clenching and unclenching those muscles - like you're trying to hold pee in.  For best results BOTH OF YOU SHOULD DO THIS.  She'll have better contractions, you'll have harder erections and will ejaculate further.  It also aids in later life for things like incontinence (significantly reduced risk).

eQqhFv9yaa	Food poisoning is a common, yet distressing and sometimes life-threatening problem for millions of people in the U.S., and throughout the world. People infected with foodborne organisms may be symptom-free or may have symptoms ranging from mild intestinal discomfort to severe dehydration and bloody diarrhea. Depending on the type of infection, people can even die as a result of food poisoning.    More than 250 different diseases can cause food poisoning. Some of the most common diseases are infections caused by bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, and botulism.     If you think you may have been exposed to the infection, see your doctor. By testing a sample of your stool, the bacteria can be identified.    If you are found to have the infection, you will likely recover on your own without treatment within 2-5 days. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent becoming dehydrated.
AA11591005	-Symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder-    The narcissistic personality disorder is one of the top three most difficult personality disorders to treat. It is defined as an ongoing pattern of grandiosity and need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. It should be noted that it is three times more common in males than females. These individuals have an obvious self love, and believe they are knowledgeable and indeed expert in a wide variety of areas. They are usually shocked when they are not praised for their efforts. These individuals are preoccupied with success and power. They feel they are gifted and talented. They may make statements like, I have a photographic memory, when in reality they do not. They rarely admit to a mistake or wrongdoing. They rarely apologize when the occasion arises. These individuals insist on having the best of everything. They are grossly defensive, and unable to look at themselves objectively. They have an inflated and false sense of entitlement, and lack of sensitivity towards others. They feel they deserve whatever they want or need. These individuals are extremely self-absorbed. If they are giving, they usually give monetarily, and are unable to give emotionally. They are viewed by others as arrogant and snobbish, act condescendingly towards healthcare providers and therapists in the assessment phase. It is also very common for these individuals to act ingratiatingly and very complimentary in the first session, very similar to traits found in sociopathic personality disorder. These individuals are extremely sensitive to criticism, although may not show it outwardly. When their shortcomings are targeted, however, they may appear extremely wounded.    -Causes of Narcissistic Personality Disorder-    There are many theories regarding what causes a narcissistic personality disorder. Subsequently what you are about to read is one more theory, based on my experiences in treating many patients with narcissistic personality disorder. I have found definite commonalities between individuals from which one can draw conclusions regarding causation. As such, I believe one of the most common causes is impoverished self-esteem, occurring at a young age. These individuals often have a loss of a strong father figure in their lives. If they have not lost their father figure, then the father has been emotionally absent. These fathers are usually condescending, critical, and do not empower their children at a young age. Subsequently, as they grow older these children overcompensate for their lack of self-esteem, carrying with them some traits from their fathers such as the emotional distancing, while inflating their false sense of self worth. Sadly, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder really never find their true selves. In therapy, it is extremely difficult because these individuals are grossly defensive. When targeting a narcissistic personality disorder and in trying to reflect back to them perceptions of their loved ones and others around them, they become defensive, digging their heels into the sand, adamantly believing that it is everyone elses fault. This author has found that if the narcissists parents are still alive, it can be extremely beneficial to discuss with them the importance of focusing on some of the issues that exist, such as the father-son relationship, and some of the voids in that relationship. This may be of benefit in terms of turning around some of the symptomatology of the narcissist. The narcissists mother is usually a passive individual who has enabled the pathology to continue over the years. There may or may not be alcoholism present in the family.    -Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorder-    Treatment of narcissistic personality disorder takes the form of one-to-one therapy. Sessions should be a minimum of 45 minutes long. The patient should not be confronted at the start. It takes awhile to develop a trusting relationship. Eventually the sessions should be twice a week.  It is important at some point to move into marital and/or family sessions, for one-to-one therapy will not long be beneficial.    Medication is of no use. In fact, patients usually adamantly resist medication. It is not uncommon for these individuals to be referred to therapy by their employers, especially when increased conflicts continue in the workplace. Nevertheless, the prognosis is dim. These patients usually consistently have relationship problems, and therapy does become stressful and tiresome.    Narcissists DO NOT try to commit suicide. When you love yourself as much as a narcissist does, suicide is not an option.|`|6850049865edfc35c0c9b7f45b6868b9aa	First of all, a lot of people who live or work with you probably think you're intolerably self-aggrandizing and believe you know it all or are the best at everything. Most of them probably just have the tact not to say it to your face. You probably treat people like dirt without even realizing how cruel you are to people. You probably think you deserve better than others simply for being you while in reality the world just doesn't care who you are; in actuality, you deserve the same treatment as everyone else.    You are probably enamored with yourself and talk about yourself and your accomplishments to mind-numbing length. Essentially, if you have narcissistic personality disorder, you have a deluded sense of self, and most everyone else doesn't see you as you see yourself.|`|AA12050379	Try Masterson's book "Search for the Real Self"|`|AA11387869	****Sarah--Sorry, the first two links (the MSN ones) didn't work, so I edited them out.

Una  tctica util fue cambiar los hbitos cotidianos asociados con el tabaco, buscando actividades nuevas mas saludables (hacer ejercicio ligero y otras actividades recreativas/ tener sexo mas frecuentemente / conocer gente nueva no fumadora).  Otra tctica fue averiguar las estadsticas mdicas relacionadas con el consumo de tabaco...es impresionante la cantidad de males a la salud que provoca. Cualquiera se espanta y deja de fumar.

But hair keeps growing back, unless you have a condition.  A change in diet does affect your hair, also, if you're stressing, that may be it too. Just try going a couple of weeks without a certain food or something.  Also, if you're a diabetic, you may lose hair sometimes.  If you haven't been tested and there's a history in your family, you should get it checked.|`|Gtc161gRaa	you're supposed to lose like, 100 hairs or more a day.      it's normal.  some people have thicker(more) hair than others, so they lose more hair.

YIs51Vp8aa	Without Question it's Turbo Jam!!!    Turbo Jam is my favorite of all the Beachbody Workouts! The Cardio is awesome and the focus on the core and abs is great. I use a heart rate monitor and doing the Punch Kick and Jam workout I burn about 850 - 900 calories in the 50 min. I burn about 550 - 650 or so doing the sculpt workout.  I was able to shed about 15 pounds of fat with the Program in a relatively short time.  I now do her other program ChaLEAN Extreme.    I have the entire Turbo series and use one of them almost everyday!    The key is to keep good form and your intensity up! I had the great opportunity to workout with Chalene live on 3 occasions and that really helped me take it up a bit. Crank up the music and really go for it. I also use the weighted hand gloves for a little extra ;)    You will LOVE Turbo Jam!  The Music is Awesome and the workouts are very fast paced so you will NOT get bored.  you also can get other products in the series to shake things up a bit!|`|cFFa6FW3aa	Turbo Jam!

f4545bba2b50ec3058700fc531722adeaa	There is, however, an interesting dimension to scientific and the spiritual. We may characterize this as science-based spirituality. What is today known popularly as Kriya Yoga provides a fine illustration of the synthesis in question. It is a simple psycho- physiological method by which human blood is re-oxidized. By reoxidizing his venous blood, the yogi is able to prevent the decay of his tissues (made up of cells). It is being claimed that an advanced yogi, like Maha-avtar Babji, transforms cells into energy. He can, at will, materialize and dematerilize at any place. This has been an ancient yogic practice that Lord Krishna is believed to have revived and taught Arjuna. Later, the knowledge of Kriya Yoga passed on to Patanjili, the founder of the prevailing system of yoga in India. It has evoked considerable scientific curiosity in America. Some American scientists are engaged today in discovering the practical effects of non- breathing. Investigations are on to see it non- breathing exercises can be prescribed for achieving longevity and for preserving youth.

c59f33dee33b2089d758fc0ba9afd6f3aa	I copied and pasted this link from http://www.bipolar.com:    The first medical breakthrough in the treatment of bipolar disorder came in the 1950s. Treatment has made great strides since then. Today, there are many medications and therapies used to manage bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder can hold jobs, raise families, and live normal lives.     Although bipolar disorder has a number of common symptoms, treatment can vary. What works for one person may not work for someone else. That's why it's especially important to work with a healthcare provider to find the right treatment, or combination of treatments. There are three basic parts of treatment for bipolar disorder. They are medication, therapy, and self-care.  An explanation of the Medications to treat bipolar disorder  Talk Therapy can help people with bipolar disorder manage their illness  Here are some tips on Self-Care  If you're interested in Clinical Trials for bipolar disorder, click here.      *******Most Psychiatrists start with meds to get you stabalized**********|`|AA12050379	Mood stabilizing medications and therapy.|`|d386583e0023fb183d15a5b581d8066caa	no such thing,forget about it|`|8dcff1e572d10e78661bd823864c735aaa	If you want to go the vitamin supplement way this is what I would suggest  1.

8ba614025fcbb970cec97e3f152d6d21aa	It doesn't tickle!!!  But not as bad as some people make it out to be.  You don't actually wax your vagina, just the outter labia and the hair above.    If you are going to get it done, have a PROFESSIONAL do it!  Go to a VERY reputable place.  This is not the time to be cheap.  Call ahead, some places will have a topical numbing cream, if not google "no scream cream" and put it on about 15 minutes before you have it done, it will make things numb, but it's not for internal use so be careful.  if you keep it on your fingers too long it'll make them slightly numb.    Ask about the procedure, what type of wax they use.  I do not recommend using the hard wax, if they do, the procedure can take 1 hour plus (it's embarrassing being naked from the waste down for that long).  The lady I go to has me in and out in 20 minutes b/c she doesn't use a hard wax and she's awesome.  |`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	it would hurt a lot|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	I'd rather give birth again!|`|1thElV58aa	no you can try nair.. works great for the stomach, your butt or back.. dont try if your skin is sensitive..    ok try waxing your own arm pit. first. then you will know yes it hurts i tried doing it myself... my art pit starting bleeding a little bit..      so i would not!!! people wax there breast to?!?!? since when|`|86f969159f18b3f1f3e64e4d8000b957aa	I promise I will be gentle..|`|26sgtIhsaa	wouldn't hurt for me, i'm drunk!|`|9NDT65uJaa	Oh ya it soes it kills like hell but my boyfriend can't see me like that so I do it anyway....

I don't think these "professional" boob measurers are always right - there was a program on TV some time back where Trinny and Susannah were professionally measured in several respected stores, and they all gave different measurements.   Bras tend to differ anyway - you can buy 2 in the same size, but they won't feel the same when you wear them.  I tend to use the measurements as a rough guide, but wear what feels comfortable.|`|ZpT6RxOcaa	The cup volume on a 30F is the same as the volume as a 32E but the shape may be slightly different.  The band size of a 32 is larger than that of a 30 and due to this you are likely to get less support as the majority of support from a bra comes from the band and not the straps.  While it would probably fit of the tightest hook you are liable to have problems with it riding up at the back and rubbing you so a 30F would be best if this is what you have been measured, if you look on line you are more likely to find the right size.|`|1KP62lYHaa	30F and 32E are BASICALLY the same size...    but obviously they are slightly different, so you should always try to get the 30F. (which is quite an unusual size- so it might be a lot easier to find 32E's!)  the 30F will be more comfortable, but 32E should be fine if you can't find anything else.    :)

7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	Basically because the music and other sounds/noises were at too high of a decibel level for you ears.  Any prolonged, loud noise is bad for your ears. Basically, your eardrums vibrate in response to sound so you can hear them. Every sound gives off waves, and they hit your eardrum.   But if that sound is long and loud, such as a song, it can damage your hearing.  In the future, you might want to wear "concert" earplugs, that is if you want to protect your hearing. If you're young, you may not notice the effects, but as you get older, you will, in the form of decreased hearing capabilities.  Those earplugs may not make you cool, but at least you'll have good hearing when you're older.   So, basically, noises as such from a lawnmower, a leaf blower, an airplane are not good for the ears. A concert or even music at a party can be even louder.... and worse, because we usually stay at concerts or parties for hours. Again, it's that combination of prolongued exposure to loud sounds that's damaging.|`|noZurTOJaa	you're not used to having no noise

If you're under 9   you should take an iron pill.  The best time to take it is at night, unless you have to take more than on a day.   Slow Fe is usually recommended by most doctors.   Also increasing your good foods, spinach and such with the iron pill helps the slow fe vitamin.  Try staying away from beef and red meats as they may then throw your cholesterol off.  But follow your doctors orders on the iron pill and you should get a check in a month or two.
AA11896942	Stick to a multivitamin like "One a Day" unless your doctor specifically recommends anything else.  If you don't know enough about the individual supplements, overdosing on certain vitamins can make you toxic or otherwise negatively affect your health.    The ultimate, best way to get your vitamins is through healthy eating and fresh, organic produce.  Medical technology is always making new discoveries about how fruits and vegetables keep you healthy and prevent disease, and you may not get all of those benefits from multivitamins alone.  So the best thing to do is get lots of fruits and vegetables as well as a multivitamin.|`|70eebb2402ae2d1d64b2717730a52804aa	With modern day diets, its pretty typical to miss a lot of your vitamins, so sure, get a multivitamin.

Don't waste your money on something like Centrum - you might as well eat your money - it'll have about the same nutrition (and toxicity).  It isn't really necessary to buy individual vitamins.

The percentage of oxygen given to a preemie is based on their oxygen saturation, which is constantly monitored while the baby is on O2.  It's given because the baby's lungs aren't mature enough properly use the oxygen coming to them.  In the past preemies were sometimes kept at 100% O2 - but then it was learned that the high levels were responsible for vision problems and even blindness.|`|AA12113598	i Can't really say for sure, but it has something to do with how strong the flow of oxygen is-matched with the babys body weight- if the oxygen is too high it can actually colapse or cause lil' wholes into their lungs..

de3513ccf7383da2f933a122113bae09aa	Hi VIcki    The answer should be nutition from all doctors. That is what is missing in ALL these kids life! A product like Superfood (at healmarketplace.com) would do wonders for your child.  Here are some remedies to correct the issue.    Herbal Aids   1.Julep: This is a stimulating drink-type preparation flavored with aromatic herbs (but this is not the alcoholic drink referred to by the same term), and could be defined as "a large draft." An example of a julep would be: Four ounces (eight tablespoonfuls) cinnamon water, two ounces (four tablespoonfuls) Jamaica cayenne, two drams (one-fourth ounce or one dessert spoonful) compound spirit of lavender, one ounce (two tablespoonfuls syrup of orange peel, mixed; (this is for general weakness and depression).     Dosage: Wineglass to one-half glass at a time.     2.Motherwort: Motherwort tea will eliminate the swelling (it is also good for nervousness and depression).     3.Brigham Tea: In modern usage, the prized constituents, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, are extracted from the plants for medicinal use....The pharmacological action of ephedrine is similar to adrenalin. Its pressor and vaso-constrictor activity is slower and less than adrenalin, but it lasts longer. Unlike adrenalin, it can be given orally. It stimulates the respiration, increasing the depth of respiration, reinforces heart action and dilates the bronchi, especially during spasms, hence its use in bronchial asthma. It contracts the uterus and dilates the pupils. It also stimulates the central nervous system, this attribute being the basis for its use in the treatment of depression and for the relief of narcolepsy. It is used in vasomotor rhinitis, coryza, congestion of the mucous membranes, acute sinusitis, and hay fever. It has a slight local anesthetic action.     4.Gotu Kola: It can treat depression and mental weaknesses; many claim that it is a marvelous memory herb. If you take too much of the herb, you will experience headache and stupor; thus, you must regulate your personal dosage.     5.Lemon Balm: Others assert that the herb can truly alleviate depression, helping us accept difficult situations.     6.Lady's Slipper: It has been found to be very efficient in cases of hypochondria and mental depression which often accompanies digestive trouble, especially among women. Whenever a person feels like he cannot settle down, cannot sleep, cannot think properly, feels depressed, often from sexual overindulgence, Lady's Slipper can be a calming and balancing influence.     7.Red Rose Petals are official in nearly all Pharmacopeias, often in syrup or honey form. They were formerly employed as an astringent and tonic, but are mainly used now as a pleasant odifereant to other pharmaceutical preparations. However, the acid infusion is used to treat night sweats resulting from depression (Gri:688).     8.Sage: Another British herbalist claimed that Sage "will retard that rapid progress of decay that treads upon our heels so fast in the latter years of life, will preserve the faculties and memory, more valuable to the rational mind than life itself without them; and will relieve under that faintness, strengthen under that weakness and prevent absolutely that sad depression of spirits, which age often feels and always fears, which will long prevent the hands from trembling and the eyes from dimness and make the lamp of life, so long as nature lets it burn, burn brightly"     9.Sarsaparilla also contains cortin one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal glands. The body will die almost immediately if this hormone is stopped but if there is only a small or insufficient amount the body becomes easily ill and develops nervous depression and general weakness. So many maladies are related to adrenal weakness and exhaustion, including hypoglycemia, so people should take note if they are striving to rebuild their adrenals. Sarsaparilla may be able to help.     10.Bach Remedies: Dr. Bach left his lucrative medical practice and retreated to the Welch countryside where he began to observe human nature full time. He experienced a wide range of negative states of mind himself which were relieved by the administration of his especially prepared flower tinctures. At first Bach discovered twelve basic tinctures to alleviate depression, anger, worry, self-distrust and the like. He called them the twelve healers and wrote a short paragraph on each of them. The non-toxic flower remedies were tried on his patients who responded beautifully to treatment. The twelve remedies were finally expanded to 38. They were designed to be used and administered by even the simplest folk. Bach continued to successfully treat diseased conditions with these remedies until his death at 50 years of age.     Bach's legacy has been a blessing to many people. Although he had great results with the flower remedies, his new remedies were not accepted by the orthodox medical men of his day who once held the doctor in high esteem. Perhaps the simplicity of the Bach Flower Remedies was too great to bridge the credibility gap between medic and mystic.     Healers throughout the world benefited from Bach's discoveries. Heretofore incurable cases have been won over to the side of health.     Dr. Bach's work is now being carried on at his humble home near London, England. Mr. John Ramsell and his sister who had apprenticed themselves to Dr. Bach's assistant, Nora Weeks, create the remedies from English countryside flowers according to the instructions left by the good doctor. Bach Flower Remedies are shipped all over the world. From the stock bottles of 38 remedies an individual may have a custom-made remedy which suits his individual emotional needs.         11.Vegetables for Mental Depression: Broccoli, cabbage, collard greens, corn, kale, peas, potatoes, turnip greens.     12.De|`|e004d1d1cc896d98aa4e4534204abd37aa	Probably Prozac or Cymbalta.

60fbc59cd9cb3a6b4c2ea1875eb1b0afaa	Currently, there is no cure for endometriosis, though in some patients menopause (natural or surgical) will abate the process. Nevertheless, a hysterectomy or removal of the ovaries will not guarantee that the endometriosis areas and/or the symptoms of endometriosis will not come back. However, endometriosis can be effectively managed in a large majority of patients. Conservative treatments usually try to address pain or infertility issues.    The treatments for endometriosis pain include:    NSAIDs and other pain medication: They often work quite well as they not only reduce pain but also menstrual flow. They are commonly used in conjunction with other therapy. For more severe cases narcotic prescription drugs may have to be used.   Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Agonist: These agents work by increasing the levels of GnRH. Consistent stimulation of the GnRH receptors results in downregulation. This causes a decrease in FSH and LH, thereby decreasing estrogen and testosterone levels   Hormone suppression therapy: This approach tries to reduce or eliminate menstrual flow and estrogen support. Typically, it needs to be done for several months or even years.   Progesterone or Progestins: Progesterone counteracts estrogen and inhibits the growth of the endometrium. Such therapy can reduce or eliminate menstruation in a controlled and reversible fashion. Progestins are chemical variants of natural progesterone.   Avoiding products with xenoestrogens, which have a similar effect to naturally produced estrogen and can increase growth of the endometrium.   Continuous birth control pills consists of the use of birth control pills without the use of placebo pills. This eliminates monthly bleeding episodes.   Danazol (Danocrine) and gestrinone are a suppressive steroids with some androgenic activity. Both agents inhibits the growth of endometriosis but their use remains limited as they may cause hirsutism. There has been some research done at Case Western Reserve University on a topical Danocrine, applied locally, which has not produced the hirsutism characteristics. The study has not yet been published in a medical journal.   Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) induce a profound hypoestrogenism by decreasing FSH and LH levels. While quite effective, they induce menopausal symptoms, and over time may lead to osteoporosis. To counteract such side effects some estrogen may have to be given back (add-back therapy).   Aromatase inhibitors are medications that block the formation of estrogen and have become of interest for researchers who are treating endometriosis.   Surgical treatment is usually a good choice if endometriosis is extensive, or very painful. Surgical treatments range from minor to major surgical procedures.   Laparoscopy is very useful not only to diagnose endometriosis, but to treat it. With the use of scissors, cautery, lasers, hydrodissection, or a sonic scalpel, endometriotic tissue can be ablated or removed in an attempt to restore normal anatomy.   Laparotomy can be used for more extensive surgery either in attempt to restore normal anatomy, or at least preserve reproductive potential.   The definitive treatment for endometriosis is a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and surrounding tissue) and bilateral salpingoophorectomy (removal of the uterine tubes and ovaries).   For patients with extreme pain, a presacral neurectomy may be indicated where the nerves to the uterus are cut.   A variety of alternative treatments are being used in patients with endometriosis, including acupuncture and nutrition.|`|6bd707c77ee82c3124346483484e89daaa	my mom had to get a partial hystorectomy.|`|AA10891466	I've had it for 13 years.

You'll probably be rather dry right after your period ends.  Then you'll get some whitish, sticky discharge.  Then a few days later it will transition into a milkier, more liquid discharge.  When you have clear stretchy discharge is the time of the month that you are ovulating.  After that, you will probably be kind of dry again until your period starts up again.    You're fine.

f5f10c4e23e1adb1f21655edb30bb820aa	Teens are testing their independence, and young teens often go through a phase similar to the "terrible twos."  This can be very normal.      Some kids have problems beyond this, though, where the need to defy goes beyond the need to do what's sensible.  Oppositional Defiant Disorder kids never do what you tell them -- (well, maybe not never; that's kind of extreme).  These kids usually have another diagnosis, like ADHD, and when that condition is under control, their ability to follow directions improves.    And kids with Conduct Disorder start to get in trouble with lying, stealing, etc.  I hope your kid's just going through normal growing pains, but if the description on the link below sounds familiar, you might want to get a therapist's opinion.|`|d3ee808b7ced3d0f9ab219041f250ec9aa	yes, its called you didn't whip my butt enough now you are going to have to ground me more and wish you had taught me respect itis|`|13cb047ad0e39e961142afc8fc7fea79aa	Teen rebellion is natural, but to control them, you must however need to have some more bonding time, less shouting and lots of brainstorming.|`|a863479e76aa0d28330545ae9f31a543aa	Observation only. I believe that sometimes the parents that consume alcohol and other drug pass some traits caused by alcohol/drugs, such as the loss of inhibitions and physical pain. For example, when the parents wake up the next morning, they can, most of the time, regain some degree of morality  and their body and mind can "reason" better after the drug wears off. I believe repeated drug abuse genetically imprints the euphoria, inherited by the offspring, thus not feeling pain or shame when reprimanded, much like their parents on drugs, except and without actually being on drugs.

When your skin is injured, your body re-colors the skin (so it is not ghost white).  Sometimes your skin makes too much color and you have darker skin (hyperpigmentation).      Keep the skin moisturized to help the skin fade. Some people have scars for years.

And chances are, he loves you enough that you're beauitful just the way you are. Honestly, I hate having big breasts. They're uncomfortable, and hurt my back. Also do yoga and pilates to tone the rest of your body, this can compliment your breasts. Also, flex your under arm muscles. I have very firm breasts, not bragging here, I actually kind of hate them, because I used to fidget all the time, and I would flex random muscles when I was bored. Lightweight bench presses seem to work if you're over 40. That's what my mom does, and she doesn't look (coughs) 60 (cough). She looks 20 years younger.

2aef332686da31b6e2d97ba3d43d3da0aa	First, you have to get the best tampons. Now, they can be more expensive, but to atleast aquaint yourself with the use of tampons, getting a good brand is absoulutely necessary. The ones I learned on were Tampax Pearl with the plastic applicator. Buy the smallest size also. I know they are available in Slim (or junior or whatever they call it), however I have never seen them in the store, but the Regular size should not be too large.     The best position I'd say is with one leg up on the toilet. Once you're in position, put your fingers on the grip spot (on tampax it is shaped sort of like a swirly eye... most brands have some sort of texture there). Then, just slide the tampon up until your fingers are touching the opening of your vagina. If it doesn't go in right away, just keep trying, and eventually it will get up there. Experiment with different angles... but also realize that you may have to push a little to get it through the toughness of that area (especially if you are nervous, the muscles there can tense up).    Okay, once your fingers are at the opening, keep your thumb on the grip spot, then use your pointer finger to push on the actual applicator tube. Push it until the tampon won't go any further. When this happens, the tampon may not be fully out of the applicator, so just start to gradually pull the entire plastic contraption out, while still pushing on the applicator tube... and there you go!    It does take a little getting used to, but tampons are definitely the best (and least smelliest) route to keeping yourself clean when that time of the month rolls around.    I learned how to use a tampon without my mom's help, so it's really no big deal. Just realize that you may have to waste a few tampons trying to practice getting it in just right (I think I went through about 10 before I finally got it to go in correctly)|`|4fe283bf575b2467e4266afc72285676aa	I did not even attempt a tampon till after I was sexually active and more comfortable with my body.    I am 38 now, and I was about 21 when I tried a tampon for  the first time.  If you are familiar with yourself, you will be  able to "feel" your way around and will know right away  if you got it right.  Be sure to wear a pany liner in case.  And I would suggest you use the new Pearl variety as they  are super smooth. Some tampons also come in different sizes, including teens.    Good Luck!|`|lKDdyikEaa	It works the best if you use a tampax pearl, they slide really well, and if you put your foot up on the toilet seat, you really dont feel anything at all. remember to relax and dont force it in to a specific place. let it guide itsself. GOOD LUCK! :)|`|wT5KBfVcaa	and use the smallest size possible.|`|9a3ccdf4d5df867007129af79c6f5f84aa	Use the smallest size at first, and take a deep breath as you're inserting and RELAX your pelvic floor muscles...if you tense them up then it will make insertion more difficult and maybe even painful...Also aim  towards your lower back, the vaginal canal naturally curves that way...If you can feel the tampon after you put it in then you didn't get it far enough inside you and you will have to try with a new one.  Also read the directions that come inside of the box thoroughly...|`|BDkfsC6gaa	read the box

cEa8TTenaa	Not all girls have pain - some women get a period and hardly notice!    Contractions of the localised region is probably why - a great way to try and prevent pain is to take a combination of magnesium and calcium in a tablet - magnesium is a well-known muscle relaxant and calcium is always necessary for women, since it is a fact that lack of calcium causes cramping.    So, a lack of these two trace elements could very well be the cause. Taking them will certainly do no harm, and if done a couple of days before a period is expected, and through the cycle, the tablets may make it all that much more bearable.    I hope this helps|`|ZX1AOUHvaa	Muscle contractions.    Aspirin is the best because it thins the blood. You may experience a lot of pain if you're passing clots.

However, if he has not consulted any GP or medical specialist, bring him to consult either one and obtain a referral letter.      I don't think that anyone can just register themself into a rehab centre without a medical referral letter.|`|FZTO6r2Aaa	Drug-rehabs.com is a good source of rehab centers.  I am not sure what state you are located in, though this site has all states available.  If you have a local narcotics anonymous that would be a good place for references.  Please be realistic...drug rehab is one of the hardest things there is.  Make sure that it is a long term in patient program.  Day programs are far to risky.  Unfortunately he does not see that he needs to do anything about his problem.  One must first come to terms with the fact they need help.  My best advice would be to admit him into a mental health facility to get him detoxed before he goes to rehab.  The side effects from morphine withdrawal can be very unpleasant and he would be better of to be in a facility that can ease him off before going to rehab.  Rehab centers are not know to provide the medical expertise a mental health facility can ween him down.  I would start with a visit to a good phyciatrist.  He may not be willing to go, but you can on his behalf to get good information about what is ahead and some good recommendations on a facility.  He is blessed to have a family who is concerned and caring.  Don't be too disappointed if it doesn't work the first time if he is not willing to admit his addiction and desire help.  A phyc ward would be the best place to start in my opion.  I have been through drug and alcohol treatment.  It worked because I knew I have a big problem.  I was hospitalized to assist me with withdraw symtoms first.  Bless you and your family for loving him and recognizing that he needs help.  Patience is the key, also family theraphy meetings are important in the rehab process.  9 times out of 10 there are underlying factors in something that he needs to resolve so that he can get onto the road to recovery.  Also narcotics annomys is very important once he gets out.  He needs a great support system and to disassacate with the people he is drugging with...no matter how good of "friends" he thinks they are.  I hope for everyones sake involved that you find excellent help for him.  Be prepared...this can be a very ugly, painful experience for everyone involved.  But if you suceed it will lead you all to a happier life....|`|LwEfnQxdaa	Actually, only your brother's doctor can answer that question because you will be needing a referral from him. I guess you should just make it clear to your brother's doctor what you guys want from a rehab center. From the characteristics of a rehab center that you specify, the doctor then would be able to make a sound decision on which rehab center to place your brother in.     I personally had a friend who underwent rehab a few months ago and he said that rehab treatments in Florida are pretty good and conducive for his rehab program. I suggest you check this out if you guys live near Florida.

This happens with thicker skin.    Our skin cells absorb a little bit of  water when we soak too long in the tub, he says. And because the skin  on our palms and the bottoms of our fingers and feet are thicker than  other parts of our skin, they swell more than the rest of us. Because  this swelling layer of skin is connected underneath to tissue that  does not swell, the skin buckles. Hence, wrinkled fingers and toes.  |`|AA10102392	It's because his skin absorbing water.

PTXX05dhaa	You have to rule out what it isn't, in your search for what it is.  I would start by first seeing a doctor. Let him know how you are feeling, and request being tested for both Dyslexia and Attention Deficit Disorder. If you have a medical condition causing the problem, medication will correct the problem. Medical problems can lead to emotional problems.   Keep in mind, and I'll be blunt, if you use recreational drugs...they can lead to problems like this, which at times can become permanent!   Also keep in mind that as we age the body goes through changes. This happens into our teens, twenties and beyond. Your body may be giing you a symptom that will go away by itself in time. Problem is, it's getting in your way now!|`|Gu8CNqLpaa	EVAN!!! REMEMBER ME?    Wow didn't think to see you again.

And have them run a few blood tests. It's not normally for an 18 year old to be feeling like this. It could be post-concusion syndrome. But that seems unlikely to me for some reason. I know what i'm talking about and you need to get it checked out. Their also could be a tear in your CC, corpus callosum. The CC connects the east and west hemispheres of the brain. and to access memories you need to use both sides in rapid secession. a tear in the CC also causes Dyslexia. Hope everything turns out for the better.

I have a friend on the DSP and you would barely know he has an illness. well i'll start off by saying that a year ago the australian government curbed people going on the DSP. that is because there are so many people on it now. so now you have to sit a lot of tests. i'll give you some advice. get something you really love to do. and do it every single day. and then go in and tell centrelink that you want to see one of their psychiatrists and get the test done. their doctors are the ones that determine whether or not you can go on the DSP. but in the meantime try to get yourself on either the sickness benefit or the PSP. ask either centrelink or your cousilor about those benefits. good luck.  PS to get on the DSP you need to have a certain percentage of impairment and i think now its about 90%. (roughly thats only an estimated guess but im guessing thats it)  and they shouldnt be telling you about how u look. hell there are badly dressed people that walk into thier offices every other day. i wouldnt worry about that. you know what i call them sometimes??

9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	DO NOT TAKE HYDROXYCUT.    I am a heart patient. I am a heart patient because I took a performance-enhancing drug for 6 years called ephedra. My heart is now twice its normal size.    Understanding that Hydroxycut no longer carries ephedra (what they love to call their previous ECA "stack" to entice weightlifters), I also read the webpage they have displayed about their side effects and benefits.    Let me ask you: do you know much about your heart? Did you know your heart works off of two distinct electrical impulses? Did you know that your heart feeds off of calcium and potassium? They don't go out of their way to tell you this, but they are so kind as to include a nominal portion of calcium in with their "Hydroxygen Plus" secret recipe of herbs and spices.    When they gear their product towards weightlifters and say it's a weight loss drug, something SHOULD come to people's attention. When they use muscle-bound people to hype their product, you can guarantee they didn't use the product to do what they want them to say it did- they pay them to say that.    Concerning side effects: ANY TIME you see a side effect include the word "heart", a person should stay away from it because (1) herbals are not regulated by the FDA, (2) their "pharmaceuticals" aren't given strict cleanliness guidelines that the FDA would provide, (3) herbals are like alchemy, (4) only doctors know more about your own heart than you do. Ask any doctor about taking herbals and I personally guarantee that if you take my answer in with you and show it to them, they will ALL agree! They will ALL agree without my answer. Keep in mind that the doctor's advice is like canon compared to anything non-doctors can give on Yahoo! Answers.    I suggest asking the same question in the medications or the heart section of Yahoo! Look for a doctor's advice because no matter what I say there will be people willing to cut me down and say I'm wrong. I was 28 when I was diagnosed with CHF. I thought I knew it all then; I know much more now that they probably do.    ** The FDA fights for the individual. They go above and beyond to make sure that the drugs they regulate are safe in the long term, and they have access to information that no business "pharmaceutical" has, meaning any long term side effects of their regulated drugs will be met with changes only they know are going to happen in the future!    Non-FDA regulation means the companies that sell it can do whatever they want with it on the market. Here's how they list their first three side effects, so you can understand how they want you to divert your attention away from the heart:    * Increased blood pressure  * Increased heart rate  * Increased sweating    Immediately, when a not-so-understanding weightlifter sees "sweating" (telling this as a former amateur weightlifter), they might immediately drop whatever thoughts they have toward the heart and say, "How is sweating a bad thing?" They DESIGN their product to SELL it! They couldn't give a flip about your heart because money is the language of the here and now! If they cared at all, they wouldn't sell the product. The government should ban all forms of heart speed-increasing herbals like guarana and internet sales of ma huang (ephedra).    ~~~~~~~~    Always be wary of a company who lists their business name with the word "pharmaceutical". True pharmaceuticals like GlaxoSmithKline would never have to include that word because they are renowned for their medications. There is competition between them, but that's more or less aimed at the doctors who prescribe their medications. I'm not saying that Hydoxycut does this- I'm saying that there are many companies out there who do and who either change their business name or go out of business within "two years" so that they don't have to face any impending lawsuits for those who have killed their hearts taking their stuff. Talk about the ultimate soul-selling technique.    Concerning the naming of drugs, no true pharmaceutical has to give their drugs pet names, like "Hydroxygen Plus" (to highlight the word "hydroxy" and sell their product). Instead, true medications carry two names: one for the individual to be able to say and spell, and the other a complex list of prefixes, suffixes and syllables that are designed to communicate the way they work to the doctors. For instance, drugs like aldactone and trazodone (both having the same suffix -one) are different drugs with the same structure.    ~~~~~~~~    ALLI is FDA aprroved and they go out of their way to say that their drug doesn't cause a rapid heart rate. They even mention GlaxoSmithKline. For that reason ONLY I would mention that for weight loss.    ~~~~~~~~    How to lose weight the fun way:    1. Purge your body of toxins the first two days by drinking nothing but fresh citrus juices (lemon most importantly) and water. You will feel a sick buzz feeling inside your skin; this is the toxin being removed from your body.    2. Purchase products like Benefiber and mix it with all-fruit-only smoothies. Take bananas, apples, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and peaches and chop them into ice-cube-size chunks then freeze them mildly separate from each other so they don't stick so much. When you want to blend a smoothie, you won't have to use ice cubes this way- just pop in your mix of fruit, add milk or water, and blend.    3. Eat more often during the day; just make the meals smaller. I suggest eating granola or bran in the morning. Combine this with yogurt, nuts and fruit.    4. Remember that a body will burn carbohydrates before it burns fat. The less carbohydrate you have in your system, the more fat will be burned to account for the energy needed. This does NOT mean to stop eating carbohydrates in the morning. This is very important.    5. |`|VSw6eN4Baa	These products are a scam and mess up your body's chemistry, causing you to burn fat quickly, but also gain it back just as quick.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|6qsocyK3aa	Ditch the junk food,   eat regularly (3 square meals a day with low-calorie, healthy snakes in between),   swap full fat products for lighter versions (like light mayo, skimmed milk etc),   aim to get your 5 a day,   go easy on alcohol (no more than 2 units a day and if you do that stick to stuff like red wine which is actually good for you in small amounts)  don't have sugar in your tea  swap milk/white choc for dark choc as you will need less as it is richer. it also has antioxidents in it.  drink plenty of water.  start doing a form of excersise you enjoy whether it be jogging, swimming trampolining.    good luck!|`|ELCJQXMraa	Well you can go on a little diet i don't know of any but if you ask your doctor you should find out.  Contact your local doctor to see if you really need to lose the weight but if you want to do it right away. You should just eat the food from the food groups necessary with the right servings ect. Be sure to exercise lots and only eat when there is meals Breakfast lunch and dinner try not to have any snacks in between and excerise regularily at the gym, or just being active! Hope you have good luck and lose your weight!
ItJzrvQ4aa	The protruding stomachs typically result from one of three factors.     The first is edema in the abdominal area (edema represents a "puffiness" due to accumulation of fluid that has seeped from the bloodstream into surrounding tissues). This edema is a result of a lack of proteins in the bloodstream. The proteins in the bloodstream cause water to remain in the bloodstream. As the concentration of proteins in the bloodstream decreases, the water moves out of the bloodstream and into the extracellular spaces. This causes edema. The edema is particularly evident in the abdomen--especially in children.     The second cuase of a protruding stomach is an enlarged liver which is a result of inflammation as well as an accumulation of fat. Fat accumulates in the liver because` there are not enough proteins to allow it to be transported in the bloodstream.     The third cause of the protruding stomach can be due to parasitic infections, which are very common in malnourished people and, of course, make their malnutrition worse.|`|Jzi3YCScaa	I think becuase of the water in their stomachs, or worms.. or gas|`|jw6Lpt37aa	because there food it always contain maize and corn and that make the stomach be floated with gas|`|AA10727113	When starving the internal organs (liver, spleen, etc) tend to swell giving that overly full look that happens.

958e8b8fd2dbc26508bfdb3f63eae9e6aa	Besides the obvious answer of seeing a doctor (sleep specialist) who will give you lots of options, a good home remedy to try is having her use a mouthguard.  The mouth guard moves the jaw forward, opening the back of the throat more, moving the soft palate out of the path of airflow (which usually causes the snoring sound).  Another good over the counter choice is breathing strips that open up the nasal passages.  Good luck.|`|AA10358331	There are things that you can get to put in your nose that opens things up. There are sprays that can be sprayed in the back of her throat to wet the part of the throat that vibrates. But what you should do if find out the real reason why she is snoring. Does she have allergies? Or does she have sleep apnea. One of the big signs of sleep apnea is snoring. Its caused by not getting enough air when she sleeps.   Good Luck!

In September I started swimming again, and for the first few times, when I got back into the locker room my head was spinning, my body ached and I felt like I was going to throw up. When this happened I would just sit down, drink some water, and then take a nice hot shower. I know its a disconcerting feeling, but don't worry, after you've been exercising for a while it will go away as your body gets used to exerting itself again.

Pq1fVyMoaa	Everyone has a different stomach/digestive system, and some are "tougher" than others.  For many people, coffee is simply to strong and will cause the symptoms that you described.  I would simply avoid it, or it you truly must have it, then have a very small amount and dilute it greatly using milk.  They also have some brands of coffee that are considered more gentle on the stomach for people who are sensitive to it.|`|M6QBeLc8aa	it could be because you have a sensitivity to abnormal amounts of caffeine in your system, seeing as how you don't drink it all the time.  try decaf !|`|HE41ivhVaa	Get checked for diabetes|`|AA11740795	If you know you're going to get sick if you eat/drink something with coffee, why do you do it?

Kxwyy0Eaaa	Buy some all-natural whole wheat bread. I do not think that bread and pasta and rice are evil, just the processed white bread with all of the good stuff taken out and then bleached and then have some vitamins added back in, but it's not nearly as good (in taste and nutrients) as all-natural whole wheat. It's the only type of bread I buy and the only type of bread I like.

I think the most important factor is heart rate.  There is a target heart rate that you need to calculate for your own body (google "how to find target heart rate").  If your heart rate is too low or high, it actually keeps you from burning fat.  You actually don't have to work out too hard to keep your heart in that zone, just spend lots of time exercising with your heart rate in that target zone.  Good luck!
HPn75mp8aa	Before answering that I'll let you in on a little secret: everything you eat has been bioengineered for taste, yield and everything else for thousands of years. Of course way back then it was done through careful cultivation and cross pollination to produce a hybrid but in the end you're not eating the same food that our ancestors ate 10,000 years ago.    As for the current state of bioengineering foods, that's still up for debate. There's no credible source that I've seen or heard that says it's any worse for you than the food you normally eat. Yes, there are fringe movements out there that decry these foods as unnatural and will eventually kill you but there are no studies that prove this.    Personally I'm all for it if it means feeding the world and bringing an end to famines and malnutrition.

weBvwrloaa	no, you will however have to make another appointment to speak to her about it and talk about a different method of birth control as the shot may not be suitable for you for  some reason. She/he will do an assessment based on your health and considering things like smoking and headaches, etc..But another physical exam isn't necessary if it's been such a short period of time.
BhJAYWNCaa	You can eat lots of vegetables and pretty much any drink, except whole milk, cream, and hot chocolate (unless you make it yourself with plain cocoa, sugar, and skim milk). Most cereals are OK, except maybe granola, which is high in fat.    You can eat low-fat snacks such as pretzels, baked chips, jelly beans, jellied candies such as jujubes, sugar candies such as hard mints (not most soft mints), "lite" popcorn (with no added butter), and anything labelled "low fat."  (This is assuming you eat reasonable quantities, of course, not gorge yourself.)    Generally, just read the label. If shortening or hydrogenated vegetable oil or palm/nut oils or butter or cheese or nuts is one of the first few ingredients, stay away from it. Keep in mind that hard fats and hydrogenated oils are much worse than light oils but go easy on the oils until you can judge the effect on yourself.    All labels in the U.S. and Canada have nutritional info on them, which lists total fat. Read that so you know how much fat you are eating.

It will take time, and its better if it takes time rather than all of a sudden because then problems can occur.      I think you should eat more fatty foods (not junky food, healthy fatty foods).     And don't forget dessert!|`|rnQjDbAdaa	You are still growing and it will take time for your body to fill out and for you to gain weight.  Just keep eating healthfully and if you are really worried about being underweight talk to your doctor about your options.  As long as you are eating healthy regularly and getting all your nutrients then you should be okay.  Maybe you are just naturally very slim.|`|76SAdZ19aa	Your BMI is 17 and that is a good weight. So I don't think you have to gain any weight.
3aPwrlBUaa	Each egg contains about 5.2grams of protein, i have 5 for breakfast. Usually 5 egg whites and 3 yolks... don't jog if your bodybuilding tho you wanna be putting on weight not losing it. Tryt to eat stuff like oats and tuna too.
dfcCoGwRaa	No.  This person's suggesting a low caloric intake for 1/2 the day before a weightlifting session to reduce body fat and then a high caloric intake after to put your body in an anabolic state to put on muscle mass.      It doesn't work like that.  In total the caloric intake either comes out to excessive, maintenance, or insufficient.  Also, if you just keep consuming carbohydrates and calories after a weightlifting session, those glycogen storages will fill up and you'll just be putting on body fat.    Keep in mind, bodybuilding.com is not the best source of information.  There are some good articles, but there are others that are completely off.  _________________    20 grams on the weekdays total? Wow.  Any article that suggests you can do both simultaneously is a load of garbage.  Putting on muscle mass isn't just about carbohydrates, loading up on them isn't enough to put on muscle mass.      There needs to be a proper balance with fats and definitely protein as well.  Reducing the carbohydrates intake will be effective in weight loss, but if you follow a cycle like that the rest is determined by the caloric intake.      If it's high muscle mass will increase, if not, it won't.  Whether or not the carbs are reduced, the caloric intake still needs to be high enough, and if you follow a cycle of a low and high caloric intake then you'll just be losing and gaining muscle and waste your time.  If you don't cycle only one or the other will happen, putting on muscle mass or reducing body fat.  _____________________    By the way, the first person and Javier are right.  Muscle does burn fat, but that doesn't mean that you can put on muscle mass while reducing body fat yourself.  If you are bulking you will be putting on muscle mass and bodyfat, but the muscle will burn "some" bodyfat.|`|OhrysGKIaa	Building muscle does burn some fat because weight lifting has aerobic benefits too.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	the more muscle you have, the more fat you will burn...its pretty simple

They do have some that recently hit the market and are labeled as "prescription strength" as well.  It's glandular kiddo. Go talk to your family doctor. There are a few ways they can help you. Personally, I have never noticed an oder emitting from her when I'm near her and i think it bothers her more than it is bad and so it's more psychological than anything. But if it bothers you, go to your doctor.|`|76SAdZ19aa	Go see your doctor.|`|8dQI7jFVaa	I HAVE SMELLY PITS TOO. NOW I USE SUAVE CLINICAL PROTECTION.

This can sometimes run in families and is related to the surge of hormones that you have at your age. There is treatment for this, such as prescription deodorants and electrolysis treatments that stop or slow down the sweating.  Sometimes surgery is done, but I would not recommend such as drastic step like surgery.    So, again, it is treatable, and when you get older, this problem will probably resolve itself as your hormones stop surging.  Let me add, you are still a normal healthy person, this is more of a cosmetic problem than a health problem.|`|KjlxISEXaa	no, you are simply a smelly person, kill your self.|`|f94A9SSfaa	yeeh guhh, az sum have said, go to da docta if washin n deodorant aint workin  i hope it work out fo u    4SHO|`|ob61TSgjaa	i agree with the degree clinical protection and maybe some powder after your bath. its just one of those things . everybody has issues one type or another. good luck . stop freaking out or youll sweat worse.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Use a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 cup of water.

Good luck and have fun!!|`|SUs4rN49aa	If you aren't going to feel comfortable in a bikini, then you shouldn't buy or wear one. There are some really nice one piece bathing suits these days, once that aren't ugly bold flower prints, but actually nice! Also, you could try for a tankini, just have a look in the store and try on different bathing suits until you find one that looks right for your shape.
0Ei3ePJzaa	Weight Watchers loved Chinese, it is the dieters friend.  A vegetable chop suey with boiled rice is not too shabby.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Losing weight fast is a bad idea.

Me and my boyfriend (;]) both like the way I look but I'm trying to watch what I eat at the moment to shift a few pounds before a skiing trip to be healthier and make the most out of it. It'll be a wasted 600 if I die of exhaustion on the first day!    Don't obsess. You sound quite young. I'm 16 and used to feel that was when I was a little younger- but I learned to love the way I looked but still keep healthy. I go spinning twice a week and it's amazing for toning up- I would recommend it to you.     To stay healthy and shift some pounds-    *Switch to 'diet' or 'light' drinks.  *Try and drink 6 glasses of water.  *Swap white bread for wholemeal.  *Do and exercise class (NOT GYM) twice a week.    I say 'NOT GYM' because it's hard to motivate yourself and easy to be lazy. I like spinning because you have an instructor in front of you to tell you to push yourself.    Good luck :)    x
h3LD0EXAaa	there are pros and cons to both, but if i had to choose 1, i would buy the elliptical. the treadmill has a slight advantage over the elliptical as far as calories burned per workout, the reason being is you are actually running and carrying all of your body weight, but the elliptical is a low impact exercise. it is much easier on the shins, knees and back. this is a huge selling point to me as i suffer from bad knees and develop shin splints if i run alot. the difference in caloric burn is minimal and i like the feel of the elliptical. my personal opinion is if it is nice outside, i would rather throw on my ipod and jog in the park rather than inside my house. if it is cold or rainy out, i will do the cardio work indoors but would rather use the elliptical because it offers a movement and exercise that i cannot replicate outdoors such as jogging.|`|UiL32MuLaa	You should save your money and do some research on functional strength training. The old belief system of grinding it out on a machine doesn't "hold water" anymore, so to speak. You should look into plyometrics or HIIT workouts. You will burn twice the calories and raise your metabolism alot more with these types of workouts. Another good thing is you can do it in less time. I know this from personal experience. use that money to invest in a good watch with a heart rate monitor. Monitor your calories, workout time and your heart rate. Its a great motivator. Trust me treadmills are fine but if you want to really change your body, change your mind and start with plyo-workouts or high intensity interval training (HIIT). Good luck!

It's an age old remedy, before they had proper medicine for thyroid problems. but with most herbal diet pills you just have to look at the rubbish in them to see they won't make that much difference.     Why pay a fortune for some caffeine, when you can get that from a cup of coffee? Cayenne is a type of pepper and some people think hot peppers such as chili can speed up the metabolism, although I expect it's minimal. I think white willow bark is a diuretic, that makes you lose more water. I don't know what the other things in it are though. I used Adios and it gave me cystitis because I didn't drink enough water with it.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  Side Lunge Slide  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot to the side, torso  upright and abs in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position,  repeating 8-12 times. Switch legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.    Lunge Slide  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot back into a lunge  position, keeping the right knee behind the toe, torso upright and abs  in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position and repeat 8-12  times. Switch legs and repeat on each leg for 2-3 sets.    Front One-Legged Squat  Stand on a step or small platform. Lift left leg out in front of step  and bend the right leg, bringing the toe of the left foot to the  floor. Touch the floor lightly and keep the knee of the bent leg in  line with toes. Straighten the right leg and repeat 8-12 times. Switch  legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.    Chair Squat  Stand in front of a chair with feet hip-width apart, abs in and torso  straight. Slowly bend your knees and lower and until you're almost  touching your butt to the chair. Hold for 2-3 seconds, knees behind  the toes, and straighten. Repeat for 12-16 reps, 2-3 sets.    Heel Drops with Leg Extension  Stand on step or platform with left leg on the step, right leg  hanging off the side. Bend the left leg and lower the right foot  towards the floor (a few inches). Straighten the left leg and bring  the right leg out to the side, foot flexed, in a leg extension. Repeat  8-12 times, switch legs for 2-3 sets.    Hip Extension  On a flat or inclined step or platform, lie facedown with hips on the  edge of the step, legs straight out behind you with toes resting  lightly on the floor. Squeeze the glutes and hamstrings and straighten  the legs until they are level with the hips. Hold for 2-3 seconds, and  lower letting toes lightly touch the floor.

They are very good for you.........if you can stand the taste!!  By all means exercise. That is never a bad idea.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Yes the Ensure drinks are healthy, but their high calories for people like underweight babies & training athletes. Perhaps that's not you, so...    Buy a pack of multi-vitamins from costco, take one of those daily & you'll get the vitamins you need but not the calories in an Ensure drink.    But for the remaining drinks you have, what i would do is drink half of one for breakfast, eat a breakfast of oatmeal or egg whites & when you you eat lunch, have the other half of the drink or after you workout.    Be sure to tell your mom "thanks" for doing what they do best, worrying about their children. The multi-vitamins should take care of it her worry.

The healthy explanations would be that you're either growing, dehydrated, hungry, tired. Or you could be anemic (have you been on your period recently? If so, have some lean red meat for an iron boost).     If the dizziness isn't gone tommorow (after drinking plenty of water, eating carbs and sleeping), then see your doctor.

9wGz6ySNaa	celery... and yes and no. negative calorie foods mean that it takes more energy to digest the food than it does to eat it, making like 20 calories of celery be -5 calories (just an example. I'm not sure about the numbers) but, the same would apply to any other food. for example a 500 calorie slice of cake might actually be closer to 450 or 475 calories. so, negative calories do and don't exist  edit: and your avatar looks just like mine but with glasses lol|`|jw6Lpt37aa	eating slices of one cucumber it will give you  only 15 kcal of water and fibre .  please visit this site and you will know what the favorite food for you with less calories and more nutrition that will help you build a very healthy body  best of luck  http://www.caloriecounting.co.uk/resourc...|`|pjgQAXM7aa	Celery; so that means yes, negative foods or zero calorie food DOES exist. Celery is already about 5 calories per stick, and when you munch on it, you have to kind of chew harder because it's so crunchy and big. So then you lose 5 calories! I found it on the food network show, so I'm not bsing you. :P     EDIT: And by the way, you should eat it plain haha if you want it to be zero calories. Or you could sweeten it with Spenda or make it saltier with salt. Which I don't know why you would do that haha. Good luck!    EDIT 2!!: If you're looking for low calorie things, the obvious ones are to just look at the nutritional facts at the back of side of the package. I always go for Diet Soda, but I kind of get freaked out that I might die someday, so I go for things like 0 calorie flavored all-natural sparkling water. You can find that stuff anywhere.|`|5cDVQED5aa	vegetables r the best fruit not as good as it contains loads of natural sugar. people say that celery has no calories cos u burn off the cal's just by eating it ????? i dont believe !!!!|`|8SRjELNBaa	Tofu and egg whites.|`|V7Lc0mzEaa	fruits and veges  go for more veges!!!!!!!!|`|R4q2cHN1aa	carrots! omgahhhhh! carrots&water!  and celery is negative calorie takes more calories to digest and chew then what you get from  it!|`|t7qDrfUuaa	Celery.

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.    Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.    Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at http://shtrainer.com|`|oxhClqAWaa	I reward myself with junk food once or twice a week if I've worked out and stayed healthy. If you plan out rewards for the workout, it could help motivate you.
gPE0wRTGaa	You're just a little bit overweight--like a tiny bit! Your BMI would be 26.2, and the healthy average is 18.5-24.9. But then again, it depends on your frame and the density of your body. If you have more muscle then you're perfectly fine don't do anything since muscle weighs a ton. Otherwise, just lose like two or three pounds. Nothing major. Don't go crazy and don't feel bad. A lot of people are only a few pounds overweight (I was recently) and it's really easy to lose weight. I just started eating fruit for snacks  and buying pre-proportioned chips and desserts for lunch and dessert so I was limited to how much I could eat (I don't know about you, but my problem was that I couldn't say no to food and preproportioned things work really well) and I lost five pounds in two weeks and I'm still losing weight. Drinking a lot of water actually does wonders.|`|oxhClqAWaa	You're a little chubby. Usually, the healthy weight range for your height is 120-140 pounds. I wouldn't be overly concerned about it though, at 148 I'd imagine you still look pretty good as it's nothing major. You don't need to start dieting or going to extremes.  If you wanted to lose some weight or get in shape, just eat a bit healthier. Limit junk food, soda, and fast food to a treat you get 1-2 times per week and be a bit more active, for example take the stairs instead of the elevator.   If you have the resources/money to do so, maybe you'd be interested in seeing a dietician?

That's the only problem with those kinds of pills, you have to take two sometimes three, up three times a day. Six pills a day? That's how they get you... Look for something that you only have to take one or two of a day. this site has a ton of options with detailed information on each product. http://www.paramount-supplements.com|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

Go to your doctor ASAP and tell them what you've just said above. Your hormones could just be a bit messed up a bit more than usual causing you to have a heavy flow. My friends on the pill at the moment, not for sex reasons, but because it can neutralise these hormones a bit more and cause you to have less cramps and smaller periods.   Don't worry about it too much but do tell your mum, and go to your doctor.     Its normal to have discharge every day. All girls are different so if your friends don't have that then its fine. Don't worry theres a lot of girls that wear it every day.    Don't worry :)

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|I54KyS8Laa	I imagine that there are some of your co-workers who really need to drop serious pounds otherwise there would be no contest. A word to the wise--anyone who really needs to drop weight may weight significantly more than you and the more they weight, the more weight they will drop. In other words, a truly big loser can easily drop 5 to 8 pounds a week. What will you look like if you drop 16 pounds?  Your efforts are put to better use by supporting those who really need to be the "big loser." Think ahead.

Salad is good too, like you said, but be sure to control what you put on the salad & take into account that it's just extra calories (ie: croutons, cheese,.. the works).|`|a866601a94a7a1716764f0de1f5f846caa	To create a cheap diet plan to meet your diet goals, check the link in my source.    As for exercise, when I'm cutting I aim for a 500 calories per day deficit, my daily requirement for maintaining my weight is about 2500, so I make sure to either eat only 2000 a day, or do 500 cals worth of exercise.    Aim to eat 1g of protein per lb of your target weight, and try to aim for 1lb/week weight loss.  Slow and steady is a lot safer and more consistent than going on a crash diet, and you'll find it a lot easier to stick to.|`|vMprJhbSaa	ok, save yourself some time, I have put together a list of websites that work and will help you lose weight quick and effective.    http://weight-loss-camps-for-adults.blog...  http://the-weight-loss-systems.blogspot....

Also, I recommend looking into protein shakes/bars,etc. Protein is the main thing that builds muscle and without a lot of it in your diet, you won't build muscle.     Meat is also good, such as steak.    As far as exercises go, it all depends on what areas you're trying to build up. Stick with your current workout, and gradually increase the amount of reps you do. You will see results eventually, but don't expect them overnight.|`|AA10241450	You need to add more resistance such as bands or weights - you own body weight is fine however you also need to add more routines not just 2?  Try doing pulls ups over the door and side planks.      If your young sometimes it takes while for your muscles to develop - also try more cardio - your be in better shape.|`|LGbBzpSlaa	Swimming.
