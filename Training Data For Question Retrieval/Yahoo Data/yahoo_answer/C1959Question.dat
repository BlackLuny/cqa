I opened my Browser and typed in  http://www.themes4bb.com  and went to their page. There is a theme on their page that I really like called "Butterflies" so I opened that them and did the "OTA Install" after the "Application Installed" notice came up on my Blackberry, I went to "Themes" and its not there. I can't even find the file that my blackberry downloaded. I even went as far as doing a "soft reset", pulled out the battery and put it back in.      So my question is, how do I get the newly acquired theme to install on my Blackberry? Is there a step that I'm missing in order for this to work? Is my Blackberry broken or is it really that difficult?      Any help would be greatly appreciated, please check out that theme and let me know if it's something wrong with the theme that I'm missing before leaving snide comments like "Learn how to use a phone" etc...      I think it's a cool theme and I WANT IT...LOL~!      Thanks~!   Christopher~!

The one going to my TV is like 15 feet and all the others are 6' cables.  In the middle of watching TV or music videos my TV will go blank and the Receiver has to find the signal all over again.

I have always had issues similar to this with all the cable/satellite providers, but all components have been replaced since. Except for the TV.  Does anyone have any thoughts as to what may be causing this issue

20090222194854AAmXrdZ	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	My tivo says "No Dialtone" please help me?	I have had tivo for a few years now. We just switched over our regular telephone line to a digital cable one. (meaning our home phoneline is through our cable provider) So none of the phonejacks are active anymore.       So now my tivo has no service and I can't get any updates or any information on upcoming shows. Our phone line runs through the modem, and it has 2 slots for telephones. I plugged the tivo into the second telephone slot, and the tivo still says it has no dialtone.       Does anyone know what I am doing wrong or have any suggestions?
