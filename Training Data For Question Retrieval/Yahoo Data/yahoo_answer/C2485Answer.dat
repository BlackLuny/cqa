He has written 5 books, one of which is on the Holocaust, and another on Nazism. Breitman confirms the role played by Pius XII in defending and safeguarding the persecuted during the Nazi regime.<br>  <br>  The professor at American University in Washington is a consultant for the working group for the restitution of Jewish property, which group has obtained the declassification of the OSS dossier. In an interview with the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera" on June 29, Breitman (who to date is the only person authorized to study the OSS documents of U.S. espionage during the Second World War), explained that the documents "are only the tip of the iceberg. Over the next 3 years, additional millions of pages will be made public. But what impressed him most in regard to Italy, was German hostility toward the Pope, and the September 1943 plan to "Germanize" the country. Breitman also found "the Allied silence on the Holocaust surprising. Their first testimonies are from the end of 1942..."<br>  <br>  Asked about relations between Pius XII and the Germans, Breitman responded: "In general, the Germans considered the Pope as an enemy. In a telegram, someone suggested to play on his old anti-communism, to induce him to ‘understand’ Nazism, and to take him from Rome to the north: the Vatican and Germany would have formed a common front against the USSR, and the Vatican would fall under Berlin’s control. But the proposal was rejected because the majority knew that Pius XII would never leave Rome, and that the Vatican was on the side of the Allies."<br>  <br>  How did they know it? "The Nazis had spies in the Vatican. Among their dispatches deciphered by our espionage one spoke of an Allied plan to disembark in Sardinia, another of the departure of a diplomatic train with Jews on board, transported from Rome to Spain. Only the Vatican was up-to-date, the Nazi ‘moles’ told general Karl Wolff, SS chief in Italy. Berlin distrusted the Pope and the Vatican, because it knew they hid Jews." Breitman’s statements in part deny the thesis of those who at present speak of Pius XII as "Hitler’s Pope" and, at the same time, confirm the hypotheses, advanced at other times by Catholic historians and researchers, according to whom the OSS documents and those of the corresponding British secret service, would result in demonstrating how great and meritorious was the action carried out by the Vatican in favor of the persecuted. Sadly, the respective U.S. and British dispatches have to date denied Catholic historians permission to see these documents but, sooner or later, truth will end up in the public domain.

g8kIjpwSaa	You're chances are as good as any other job you might want to go into. Graphic design (and illustration for the matter) is a very competitive field. You really have to want to make that a career in order to succeed. If you're thinking of getting into it because you think it's going to be real laid back and easy I would find another career path. With that said though, I've been a graphic designer for 5 years and I love it. Part of my job as a designer is illustrations, so as a designer you really can get the best of both worlds. <br>  <br>  As for movie posters and cd covers, there aren't any companies that I know of that specialize in that. Film producers and record executive teams typically hire and artist from a full service advertising agency for those types of things since they fall into the category of general advertising. And there are plenty of ad agencies out there. Of course your odds of working with movie posters are better if you work in an ad agency in Hollywood, or at least in that area of California.|`|ZDval6DAaa	i go to the academy, and i think if you work hard on your portfolio your chances of getting a job as either are good. you might want to talk to an admissions rep about what you really love doing, they can help you make the best decision for you. or send in your portfolio (if you have one) for review. they might have some suggestions based on that.<br>  <br>  getting a job is one of the reasons I chose the academy. they hold a spring show every year, where they fly in industry leaders to look at student work. many students get internships or job offers. plus, since the instructors are all working professionals, they can really help you network.

Ydbm0c8Xaa	The east coast of the United States or "thirteen colonies" were part of the British Empire.<br>  <br>  That's why there are thirteen stripes on the American flag, one for each of the (originally) British colonies that rebelled and gainde their independence.<br>  <br>  That's why the Americans speak English, not French or Spanish. The reason it's rarely put on maps, is because the people who tend to make maps of the British Empire don't want to remind themselves of the defeat they suffered, and try to ignore what modern historians call the "first British Empire".|`|wnkoTEqVaa	This is in the 1920s<br>  <br>  The thirteens colonies rose up against British rule. Read a book.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	I'm sorry to say that you're mistaken.  The British Colonies of North America which went on to become the United States were certainly part of the British Empire until they won their independence.  The map you reference clearly says that it's a depiction of the British Empire in the 1920's.  In the 1770's, the Atlantic Colonies would have been part of the empire too.  <br>  <br>  Please examine the link below, particularly the last one which includes a map which shows the shape of the British Empire prior to the Revolution.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	The British American colonies did not form part of the British Empire but were instead incorporated into a much earlier colonisation lead by the English and were part of what was then called the "English Empire".<br>  <br>  You may recall that Jamestown, the very first English colony in America, was established by an English company from the county of Lincolnshire here in UK.  That was in 1607.<br>  <br>  The establishment of 'English Colonies' in North America was based upon the free enterprise system and was a business carried out by 'companies' and not government.  Therefore the American Colonies were not British, but free enterprise English colonies of the Puritan English kind.  You could buy shares in them if you liked.  Pity we cannot do that now - things might be quite different.  Instead we get big fat government which taxes the people and worse, the English American colonies even got taxed by a British Government over which they people had no contol.<br>  <br>  "No taxation without representation".<br>  <br>  John Adams - Liberty shall reign in America. . .<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FAAVPX-jg&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FAAVPX-...</a>|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	The other answers, pointing out that this is a 1920's map are correct.

Try to make sure that everyone CALMLY hears everyone else answer these questions:<br>  <br>  1. What kind of music would you like our band to play?<br>  <br>  2. To what extent should we go for some variety in our shows? (Keep in mind that audiences like variety.)<br>  <br>  3. What is the band's policy for members taking breaks or sabbaticals?<br>  <br>  4. When we practice, who runs the rehearsal?<br>  <br>  5. How do we deal with disagreements among our members?<br>  <br>  It might be necessary for everyone to write down their answers. Being a band means that everyone works with everyone else. One person does not run the show.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to look for other places to play on your own, with other musicians, etc. You might also want to find a teacher who teaches in the style you're interested in learning, which could open up a whole new world of opportunities.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	Tell them that you are going to leave, ultimatum.<br>  <br>  Make your own band.

The war broke out in 1939. The US joined in 1942, when Pearl Harbor was bombed and concentrated their efforts (although not exclusively) on the Pacific theatre of war. <br>  What would have happened? The Japanese would have taken over Hawaii and from that stronghold, have launched attacks against Guadalcanal, the Solomans, Phillipines, Malaysia, Tahiti, Fiji and pretty well taken over the South Pacific. From that the strongpoint, they would probably have attacked the US, starting with California, and may possibly have attacked Mexico as well. The US really had no choice but to enter the war once the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.

re8recMJaa	in the first part of the century (when the uvf, ivf were being formed) 'northern ireland did not exist so you should ignore anything that declares otherwise.<br>  <br>  Politically, at the moment, the two main political parties are the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) and Sinn Féin.  'playing hard ball' as sean has put it seems fair comment as both parties represent more extreme or polarised views within northern ireland's political spectrum.  however, to say that they have been voted into power on the basis of a lack of interest on the part of the northern irish electorate seems both shortsighted and banal to me.  perhaps, it may be that many people who had been interested in politics got fed up and turned to extreme parties following exposure to the slow pace of the SDLP after John Hume and Seamus Mallon left and, for unioinists, perhaps the UUP had worked so closely with nationalists and conceded to many 'unacceptable' comprimises. <br>  <br>  Secondary parties at the moment include the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party) and the UUP (Ulster Unionist party<br>  <br>  Tertiary parties include the alliance party and the women's coalition, the green party and then there are various smaller unioinst groups and individual MPs/MLAs.<br>  <br>  Paramilitary groups have often split into factions or have used aliases- there are a lot!!<br>  main republican paramilitary groups were the IRA, PIRA (various names after the ceasefires in 1994 include the real ira, continuity ira) and the INLA.<br>  Loyalist paramilitaries include the UVF, UFF, LVF, UDA and the RHC.<br>  The british army also played its part in the civil war in northern ireland with detachments from the SAS being known to have served here though these were not 'paramilitary'!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

hZRcQXOVaa	Maybe you could try the movie I loved both versions!<br>  It's basically about 5 sisters the two oldest are the only ones out of all of them that have any sense. Elizabeth is the main character and is the second oldest. Their mother is trying to marry them off to hopefully rich young men and she is quite eccentric. There are main guys in it too and there is romance and a little bit of comic relief. <br>  Really great story!|`|YDtSz60oaa	Its the story of five sisters, whose mother is trying to marry them off (funny).<br>  It focuses mainly on Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest. Shes witty and sarcastic and unconventional. I cant say too much without spoiling it, but I loved it.
SB10m7rHaa	I love the extremely shallow depth of field (I think pictures look more alive that way) and telephoto lens can make anything look pretty.<br>  <br>  I would have moved the bird off center though, especially since it is looking off to the right. It's cliche, but I find pictures that obey the rule of thirds are more interesting.<br>  <br>  If you had placed the bird in the left of the frame, I'd be a lot more intrigued, I think. There's a difference between "Aw, cute bird" and "Wow, beautiful photo." Does that make sense? <br>  <br>  I don't mean any of this to sound harsh.

If you know about the rule of thirds, use it to your advantage. If you don't, I'd suggest looking it up! I think positioning the branch on the low third of the photo and leaving the top portion empty would look a lot nicer. Position the bird in the bottom left hand corner (look at a rule of thirds grid to see what I mean) and it will be able to hold attention a lot better.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	strong capture dude! some might say outstanding,<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: while i agree the composition could be stronger, i also know how hard bird shotting is, i wonder if the others do? it all sounds good in theory.........<br>  <br>  and of course you could always do a crop.........|`|Uy58ixnvaa	It's a nice shot, but it doesn't really capture me.

31GXcmBiaa	Well the KKK started out during reconstruction to keep out the black vote in the South and to also begin an era of violence and intimidation to ultimately limit the actions of African Americans politically and to segregate them socially.  The violence of the KKK was finally put down for awhile but reemerged in the Jim Crow south to combat the Civil Rights Movement of the 50's and 60's.  The Klan has always been around ever since it began, but the amount of members as varied. All throughout history there has been recurrances of the Klan but nothing major.  The Klan will never go away, which is very sad for me to say since im opposed to all activities of organizations that teach pure hatred.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	who cares about haters

6KaMW1Vzaa	Don't forget the $3 billion the US spent on the B-29 to carry the bombs, or the fact that most of the bombing was fire-bombing. The destruction from the atom bomb raids was no more or less than any other "day at the office" for the Air Force, except that those didn't need the normal complement of 300 planes to get the same effect. <br>  You may not be aware that General Marshall had, BEFORE Pearl Harbor, told the press about the US strategy of burning Japanese cities to the ground. That was because the interior of Japan is almost uninhabited mountain, so industry was more highly concentrated in coastal cities than in other countries, because those cities didn't zone industry in different areas from residential areas, and because the building materials were highly inflammable. It worked, with a third of the Japanese population homeless at the end of the war, and an equivalent destruction of industry. MacArthur, of course, redirected the Japanese economy, and I have no idea how you'd even go about counting that up, but I bet you could come up with pretty well any number you'd like, if you have an axe to grind.
e9bb69fe846238c30e6955cc8f654653aa	Wiki is your friend:<br>  <br>  Quote<br>  <br>  "Exploration of the Arctic coastal mainland after Franklin's second Arctic expedition had left less than 500 kilometres (311 mi) of unexplored Arctic coastline. The British decided to send a well-equipped Arctic expedition to complete the charting of the Northwest Passage. After Sir James Ross declined an offer to command the expedition, an invitation was extended to Franklin, who accepted despite his age, 59. A younger man, Captain James Fitzjames, was given command of HMS Erebus and Franklin was named the expedition commander. Captain Francis Rawdon Moira Crozier, who had commanded HMS Terror during the Ross 1841–44 Antarctic expedition, was appointed executive officer and commander of HMS Terror. Franklin was given command on 7 February 1845, and received official instructions on 5 May 1845.[5]"<br>  <br>  ~Snip~<br>  <br>  "After two years and no word from the expedition, Franklin's wife urged the Admiralty to send a search party. Because the crew carried supplies for three years, the Admiralty waited another year before launching a search and offering a ￡20,000 reward for finding the expedition. The money and Franklin's fame led to many searches. At one point, ten British and two American ships, USS Advance and USS Rescue, headed for the Arctic. Eventually, more ships and men were lost looking for Franklin than in the expedition itself. Ballads such as "Lady Franklin's Lament", commemorating Lady Franklin's search for her lost husband, became popular.[6] In the summer of 1850, expeditions including three from England as well as one from the United States joined in the search. They converged off the east coast of Beechey Island, where the first relics of the Franklin expedition were found, including the gravesites of three Franklin Expedition crewmen."<br>  <br>  ~Snip~<br>  <br>  "For years after the loss of the Franklin party, the Victorian era media portrayed Franklin as a hero who led his men in the quest for the Northwest Passage. A statue of Franklin in his home town bears the somewhat false inscription stating "Sir John Franklin — Discoverer of the North West Passage". Statues of Franklin outside the Athenaeum in London and in Tasmania bear similar inscriptions. Although the expedition's fate, including the possibility of cannibalism, was widely reported and debated, Franklin's standing with the public was not diminished. The mystery surrounding Franklin's last expedition was the subject of a 2006 episode of the Nova television series Arctic Passage and a 2007 documentary on Discovery HD Theater. The expedition has inspired many artistic works including a famous ballad, Lady Franklin's Lament, a verse play by Canadian poet Gwendolyn MacEwen, a children's book, a short story and essays by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, and several novels, and is referenced in Canadian musician Stan Rogers' ballad Northwest Passage. There is also a direct reference to John Franklin's ill-fated expedition in the Irish-American group Nightnoise's album Something of Time, specifically in a track titled "The Erebus and the Terror". Additionally in 2007, a fictional account of the expedition was authored by Dan Simmons titled The Terror, ISBN 978-0-316-01744-2."

RGJ3ggBhaa	Good for you for branching out! I'm a classic sci fi/fluff fantasy fan, myself, but I've read all of the Holmes stories, plus several about him by different authors (non-cannon, of course *grin*), and a lot of other things thrown into the mix. Nothing is quite like our friend Sherlock, of course.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for, so here are some suggestions that I put together. It was hard not to write more! I love books. *grin*<br>  <br>  Mansfield Park was my least favorite work by Jane Austen. I would suggest reading either Emma (my favorite, but a bit unusual for her), or Pride and Prejudice, both of which are definitely better books. But yet, you don't say you actually enjoyed Mansfield Park at all, so perhaps her writing isn't your favorite anyway.<br>  <br>  I just read Peter Pan, by J.M. Barrie. It was amazing. Nothing like the Disney film, but better, even. Classic children's books are usually a good place to explore for interesting reads.<br>  <br>  I would suggest "Daughter of Fortune" by Isabel Allende, which is a fiction novel that takes place in Chile and California the 1940s. Loved this book, and it's a good read if you are trying to read authors that are not native English speakers, too. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude" was also amazing, but long and a bit depressing.<br>  <br>  For the Detective/Mystery genre:<br>  <br>  Dorothy Sayers - Any books in the Lord Peter Wimsey series are absolutely necessary for someone who loves a good detective novel. This lady was one of the very first commercially successful women detective novelists. The story of her life is pretty interesting, too, but the books are just awesome.<br>  <br>  Rex Stout - He created a series of mysteries involving a detective by the name of Nero Wolfe, which starts with the book "Fer-de-Lance." I haven't read them in years, but there were pretty solid detective novels, if memory serves. A lot of friends recommend this series.<br>  <br>  Non-Cannon Holmes:<br>  <br>  "The Beekeeper's Apprentice" by Laurie R. King. The whole series was suggested by another person. These books are based on Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, but King put her own twist on the character.<br>  <br>  "Good Night, Mr Holmes" by Carole Nelson Douglas was excellent. Another author's take on the Holmes character.<br>  <br>  A couple of really strange non-cannon Holmes book are Fred Saberhagen's "The Holmes-Dracula File" and "Sherlock Holmes in Orbit," which is a collection of science fiction short stories about Holmes  edited by Mike Resnick and Martin H. Greenberg.<br>  <br>  Also, you should really take a look at some classic sci fi while you are at it, since you call yourself a new age science fiction fan. Good ones include: Anything by Isaac Asimov (especially his short stories); "Fahrenheit 451" and "The Martian Chronicles" by Ray Bradbury; "Nor Crystal Tears" by Alan Dean Foster; "Dune" by Frank Herbert; "The Best of C.M. Kornbluth" which is an anthology of short stories Kornbluth wrote, edited by Frederik Pohl; "Ringworld" by Larry Niven; and "The Steps of the Sun" by Walter Tevis. There are so many I could say!<br>  <br>  Some Fantasy good ones, for fun ;) -<br>  "The Riddle-Master of Hed" by Patricia A McKillip (plus the rest of the trilogy); "Lord Valentine's Castle" by Robert Silverberg; and "The Princess Bride" by William Goldman.|`|y5AEq2qFaa	Dear Firend . Sherlock Holmes never dies . I am a Sherlock Holmes Serious fan . I suggesting you , looking for new books of Holmes with other Authors (Like the Nikolas Meyer's Series or the son of conan doyle's seires) they are not as attractive as the original but they are better than fat poirot or Marpel .|`|be02abb061f1826771595285acd1ec94aa	There are many books out pertaining to Holmes. I have the annotated set by Arthur Conan Doyle. It took me a  while to get through it. I would also recommend the Mary Russell series by Laurie King. Different perspective on the great detective. Also The 7 Percent Solution is one. I believe the author's last name was Myers or Meyers. If you like Victorian murder mysteries, try Anne Perry. She has a whole series out with Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Pitt set in the Victorian era around the same time as Holmes. Also she has a series in the 1860s with William Monk and Hester Latterly.

If you are writing for the general market, your publisher pays you for your book, not the other way around. <br>  There are instances where you might want to have a small edition of a book published, say for example, a family history - something that would be of no interest to the general public. There are publishers who will do those kinds of books for you. <br>  But if you have written a novel, and want it to be read by the general public, be very wary of publishers who offer to publish your book for a fee. They will publish it, but they won't give it the editorial attention it needs, they won't advertise it, they won't distribute it. All they will do is print up a few thousand books (or however many you order) and ship them to you, leaving it up to you to market them. You'll end up with boxes and boxes of books under your bed. <br>  When your book is finished, either try to find an agent to handle it for you (agents don't charge up front either - they get paid out of your royalties so they are eager to find good manuscripts to sell) or approach a publisher directly. There is a book in the library "Writers' Markets" that lists about 10.000 publishers, tells you exactly what kind of book they publish and how to send them your material. <br>  good luck.|`|fkwYvFBRaa	Writers like you have every potential to get started on a publishing career. If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  I guess you would work on your publishing "budget" if you check on this guide below. :)|`|M2AiWt85aa	I came to Yahoo Answers to find an answer I found a couple of months ago - then ran across your question...<br>  <br>  I am not trying to spam here - Just giving you an alternative.

Plus, there are many other ways you can make money on the site.  (Think traditional publishing morphed with new and awesome methods!)<br>  <br>  It is in the very early stages - but check it out.  It might be something you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to do - good luck and congratulations on writing your book!!! :)|`|HbmHRiwLaa	If you self publish it all depends on the quality and length of the book.  You can publish on your home computer for $100 or less.  If you get a Writer's Market 2009 Handbook, you can send queries to book publishers, send a sample of your book and get it published for free!

It is a great beginning and if it led on to a book, I'd be hooked.  I especially like your first paragraph.  The first sentence grabbed my attention and you went on to raise some very interesting questions.  The one suggestion, as far as re-writing, that I would make is, instead of "will not ever become a glass again," I would recommend, "will never become whole again."  It just tightens the wording a little and makes it more clear.  The second paragraph could also be a little bit clearer.  Great job!  You write well and I would love to read more!|`|Ne6SLXVIaa	WOW!

pvQ1e3Fkaa	How about a man gets stolen form his home and thrown into a fast paced adventure in which in order to live, he must unlock the answer to the riddles posed to him. Each answer is some clever way of putting a deadly sin. For example, a riddle could be "I rip you apart from the inside out, destroying every clear thought you once had in an attempt to justify your pitiful life. "  Envy. Something all cool like that. (i know mine sucks) But the man has to get through door after door and each room gives him hints about the sin, but nothing clear. Put a time clock on it to increase suspense. Lets say the man lives using the sins all the time and each room changes the way he thinks of his own life. yeah... that's all I got.

XOnSRoR2aa	Nick frequently describes Gatsy with quite a bit of cynicism and even repulsion for his outlandishly lavish lifestyle, dishonesty and vulgarity, but his attitude changes as he learns more about Gatsby's past. At first he's totally disgusted Gatsby gained his fortune from criminal activity and is unscrupulous willingness to do anything to climb the social ladder and gain favor with Daisy, but then he starts to admire him for his passion and determination for achieving his dream. Gatsby's unwavering, extraordinary optimism is his redemption in Nick's eyes. It shifts Nick's focus from all of Gatsby's many flaws to his positive traits such as loyalty, friendship, romanticism, and hope, and this makes him inspirational and "great."<br>  <br>  To me, the message is to look beyond the exterior appearances of a person and instead focus on his spirit, and the power of optimism. <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace : )
vgPH9Engaa	Short answer: yes, it is professional.<br>  <br>  Long answer: there are a few ways to weed out hack sites and/or bad contests. Most contests do charge money, both as a reading fee and to help cover the costs of the prize money (lots of literary magazines--professional ones--are not-for-profit and aren't exactly swimming in money). A good contest to enter is one that offers you some type of compensation even if you don't win. Here, you get three months of access to Narrative Backstage (presumably where there's more published work for your enjoyment). Another good contest will consider your work for publication in their journal (as Narrative will do here). Regardless of whether you win or not, you might still get a publication for yourself, helping your writing career. A third way to find a good contest (and perhaps the safest way) is to view the database at the Poets and Writers website, pw.org. Here's the list of soon-to-be-closing deadlines: <a href="http://www.pw.org/content/deadlines" rel="nofollow">http://www.pw.org/content/deadlines</a><br>  Narrative is on there, and PW is a highly professional site for writers of all types. Browse the site for further insight on breaking into the writing business through magazines and contests.<br>  Good luck!

gskUjwTvaa	Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had recieved a letter from Albus Dumbledore and saying that he requested that They would tell him all about his wizarding powers and that they would keep him and treat him like a son. Aunt Petunia in the 5th book was sent a Howler and it said. REMEMBER MY LAST PETUNIA which was actually Albus's work. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon almost kicked him out. But Dumbledore kept him there to shield him agianst Lord Voldemort. As long as he called that place home.Aunt Petunia had to do it because Lily Potter was killed and since she was here sister magical knowledge flows through her and plus she has experianced magic from Severus Snape. She had to keep him.... Ron's house would have been more comfortable Sirius Black could've been more comfortable because he is Harry's Godfather. But dumbledore wanted to shield harry until he became of age. 17. Harry had been defended all the time since Lily's love protected him. Petunias were the only living reletaves so it was only natural that dumbledore but him there.|`|cvTzLEoBaa	They have to keep him under Dumbledore's orders.<br>  Hah.<br>  <br>  [I think..]|`|YjlLfaL0aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Well first Hogwarts is only on the school year not the whole year. He gets off in the summer.  Also they don't want him to be involved in magic and be like Aunt Petunia's sister.  In a way Harry was their slave so I guess that could be whyy too.<br>  <br>  That's my vote.<br>  Hope I helped a bit,<br>  -Becky|`|JqUhiXKFaa	They're bitter old control freaks, and feel that by letting them go he is winning some sort of battle. Also, unless you haven't yet read the 7th book, it explains clearly the jealousy and resentment Petunia felt when her sister became a witch and she didn't. I suppose she feels like Harry is better than she is if he go's.<br>  <br>  And Uncle Vernon is mostly just controlling. He doesn't like the idea of his inferior being offered a free education and boarding, because he thinks Harry deserves nothing but torture.
pgHlTuRnaa	Lol, good question, my friend had a siilar question... it was why dosent ed eat bella when she has her period... Im still wondering about that one myself. But I think vamps don't need to go pee because their muscles obsorb the blood, which makes them stronger, less thirsty.|`|WMiGahDNaa	Stephenie Meyer answers questions like these in her frequently asked questions for breaking dawn.<br>  here is the link <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/bd_faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/bd_faq.htm...</a><br>  <br>  its under the question: Vampires and pregnancy: when did that idea occur to you? How does that work?|`|kGxvT3AXaa	LMAO i was totally wondering the same thing while I was reading the books. <br>  Also... since their "dead" and can't grow and so on... how does Edward get Bella pregnant?|`|TWm5Smlaaa	I was asking myself the same thing today! Not a stupid question, I'm just as curious haha.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	No, they don't, because blood is their only source of nutrition so their body uses it all up for energy, movement and all that so their is no need to excrete anything..|`|U5RTRzKiaa	Haha. Well in the fourth book, it says that vampires don't use the bathroom. I'm not sure if she explained why or not, but I would assume the blood just gets absorbed into their body. That's usually the case with most vampire books.

When you are first starting out you will have limited experience but do know that if you have no experience what so ever as you claim then it is too early to apply for an agency. Build up your resume with classes, shows, etc and then give it a whirl.
JnSrN3guaa	read a book "You Can Be Happy No Matter What!" by Richard Carlson, PH. D. It'll really help!<br>  or you should write a memoir about how your life is going...or a journal, so you can look back and be all like, "yeah, that used to be me, but i don't feel that way any more." or you'll look back at a problem and say "gosh, the answer was right there all along!"<br>  <br>  how i got my meaning in life...well, I'm 16 and i think life is good.[: <br>  hey, yes, we ARE going to die, but why choose to waste it?<br>  we can do virtually anything we set our minds to, so c'mon, lets do everything we can before we don't exist!<br>  you're too young to throw your life away!<br>  anyone's too young to throw their lives away!<br>  <br>  i like books, and i figure, hey, why not be a novelist so that i have something to strive for and not feel empty! sure, there'll be plenty of bumps along the way, but that'll make me even more motivated to reach my goal! i look forward to certain movies, what my siblings will look like when they're older, what i look like when i'm older, my friends, too, if i really follow through on owning my own pet, maybe i'll move states, countries, find a person that'll change my life, maybe i want to see what happens next in life, what event will change the world, and i wanna be there to experience it. no matter how big or small it is, i wanna be there, even if it IS pointless to want it... whatever keeps my life going, i'm grabbing onto it!<br>  you should give yourself a goal, something you'd actually consider accomplishing, so that you won't have time to dwell on things like these...about how life is meaningless......<br>  we were put on this earth upon thousands of thousands of other candidates that could've been born, but WE were chosen, instead of the others, of course we're worth something more than that!<br>  you're in college, what's your major? maybe that's a "calling" for you...to do something in that field!<br>  life is sometimes a load on us, but living in the moment of contentment will make things a lot easier!<br>  in that book i mentioned earlier, i learned that negative thoughts are the CAUSE of unhappiness, not because of your money, or relationships, or whatever else. you create your negative thoughts, they are as real as your positive thoughts! and those negative thoughts are focused around the past or the future...but what about N0W! in the moment now, how do you feel? are you thinking about your past, or you future? think about the PRESENT!<br>  we CAN be happy on our own, we don't need people to create happiness for us, happiness starts within us, not from outside!<br>  <br>  it also states that talking about your problems in a low mood (like the mood i think you're in now, maybe not) just fuels the fire, and there is no real help to get out of it...if you talk about this in a more content mood, you'll be able to clear you head of negativity and look at it in a positive way, like "hey, i like doing this...maybe i should focus on that." and if you have something to focus on, something in the present, then your mind will be clear and you'll start appreciating life for what it's given you, and you won't have time to revert to depression. this takes a lot of practice, but totally worth it!! =]]<br>  <br>  sorry, i'm rambling too, but i AM a teenager! haha.<br>  but i hope you give that book a chance (if you haven't already read it) because it'll definitely help you with whatever you might need help with...<br>  I also recommend reading "The Secret"...i forgot the author, but it's a GREATLY-FANTASTICAL book! it's magical! sorry if i'm too preppy for you!<br>  but i really hope life turns up for the better for you!<br>  :D|`|AA12020110	My experience is life has a LOT of curves.  You  may not like every corner but you _do_ have to lean.<br>  <br>  life is a marvelous solutions  often disguised as terrible problems.  It is all how you look at things.   Finding a spiritual guide helps.|`|SlkAl1G2aa	Abolish the nihilism with a well needed dose of epicurean living! <br>  <br>  Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow you will die!|`|KHjlJIwtaa	I believe the point of living is to experience everything from birth to dead.  no matter how painful life itself is.|`|QMeForAGaa	life IS pointless<br>  i am only 15 and have already figured this out.is there a god?i think so...but only because what caused the bigbang?after the bigbang i beleive that god just let evrything happen.no interaction at all.infact lets say we did know where evrything came from....i would be an etheist then.anyway life is simply the unlikely chain of events occuring on planet earth where chemicals beegan interacting with eachother in a sophisticated way.AKA life. after this eveolution took over and natural selection procceded as it does.humans eventuallyu evolved but trough eveolution had developed a flaw....emotion.emotion is a uselss attribute to humans.life is went to do 3 things.be born,reproduce,die.<br>  that is the full circle of life.no higher meaning to it.humans with are over powerful brains developed emotion through eeolution.this has no eveolutionary advantage and may soon kill ourselves. off with nuclear war or wutever(just a concept i dont beleive it very likely at all though).<br>  but it cant be all that hoorible because i hasnt killed us yet.BUt one must remeber that we have obly been around 1 million years and natural selection takes hundreds of millions of years. this emotion has made us wonder purpose and if emotion is pointless then the questios that come with it must be to.<br>  so no there is no point.|`|02JUswskaa	You are obviously an intelligent and sensitive person who is at a certain age and juncture in life when difficult questions begin to weigh heavily on your mind.<br>  <br>  You must try to come to terms with the fact that some of life's questions have no definite, clear cut, answers.<br>  <br>  They will evolve as you grow older; and will continue to do so according to your personal experiences and ever changing beliefs. If you try to pin them down to a 'yes' or 'no' you'll simply drive yourself bonkers. Believe me, many of us have been there and won the T-shirt.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't despair however. It is this very uncertainty that will make your life worth the living. It will keep you guessing.You'll simply never know what you're going to get. <br>  <br>  Besides, if you knew the name of the murderer at the beginning of a Who-dunnit, what would be the point of watching the film?<br>  <br>  For time being, accept them as an ongoing project; put them on hold and be confident that you will chip away at them gradually as your life unfolds. <br>  <br>  The very best of luck to you.|`|7CHt3IE1aa	I felt very similar to how you felt until I found my direction in life- I started writing as a hobby and realised how much I loved it. Because of the writing, I managed to pull myself out of my depression and found other things that made me happy as well- I'm happily married with a beautiful little boy who brings me a great deal of joy.<br>  <br>  I'm still stuck in a dead-end job that I loathe, but now that I'm starting to have some success as a writer, I can now focus on my writing career and think of my dead-end job as a temporary thing rather than a soul-sucking black pit of despair.<br>  <br>  Because I had none of these things until I started writing, I suspect that life APPEARS aimless, but becomes worth it when you find a direction.<br>  <br>   I suspect that you haven't yet found your direction, so all I can say is that you have to try everything and go everywhere- life IS worth it, but you have to chase the things that are worthwhile. Don't surrender to depression, or the good things in life will gradually leave you.<br>  <br>  I'm a bit worried about you. Try to take care of yourself.|`|Qk7xiIkNaa	I'm 63 and I've been were you are.  I know that what helped me was to find something that I enjoyed.  You mentioned politics try volunteering for  the party that you like and get involved.  That is part of your problem in not finding meaning in your life-your not involved with anything other then being a student.  Go watch some stand up comedy and possibly try doing some yourself.  By getting involved you will be feeling the meaning.  If you can try to involve yourself in any activity that interests you. Go do it.  You have nothing to lose.  You may be the next famous stand up comedian.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	When you stop worrying about the things in life that are negative, you will begin to see the positive. Just relax a little and don't let life slip you by...you're 21, school is stressful right now - believe me, I'm a student too, and I don't know what is going on. I'm going through the motions, but not getting anything tangible in return. Soon enough, everything will come. Everything always in time will come, even if it's not how you expected it. In the mean time, have you ever seen Robin Williams do a stand up comedy routine? Not sure if it's your kind of humor, but it's funny to me!|`|pvQ1e3Fkaa	First let me say, "you're a college student". From what I know of college students, that's just a phase. You'll grow out of it and start worrying about your mortgage and a promotion at your job. <br>  But for now, the basic meaning of life in the animal kingdom is to successfully reproduce. But we humans with our abnormally thinking brains had to make some grand meaning out of it. Well let me tell you something: LIFE HAS NO MEANING. Tough luck. Don't get all depressed and all, but there is no great secret. If you need something to keep yourself going, find something you enjoy. Go help with community service or puzzles or something. I'm serious. Just live life day by day and take what comes at you. Do what you believe is the best you can do. Do what you must to feel good about yourself. Even though life has no "divine meaning" doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy it. Just because there is no key to life, doesn't mean it's pointless. It just means you can make whatever you want out of it.|`|w3uYxwiraa	Heck, of course it is. I'm living for sunsets here.

Also whenever Im standing I do releves. They help my feet a lot. you could also hold on to a chair and practice plies, and everything else you do in ballet class. Use the chair as a bar. You could also use an counter. You could also practice your pirouettes, in a small place. This would allow you to not be able to fall, as if you do fall you would hit or fall into something. OUch...

wEEOvu5Waa	Wow, interesting question. I never gave her much thought. From what I know, she left Marius because he told Pandora he would leave Bianca if Pandora would travel with him. Him and Bianca were traveling to that particular place just because of rumors that Pandora was there.<br>  <br>  As for after the possible sighting he had of her, I really dont know. I imagine she may be underground, like Lestat once did, or maybe she was destroyed by Akasha. <br>  <br>  I'll need to research this, its bugging me now xD

AA10015648	Maybe the mermaid has to find a human who wants to be a mermaid, and they switch places! But then either one of them can decide to switch back at any time.<br>  <br>  Or, the mermaid does a spell on herself, but she's only a human during the day, and at night she turns back into a mermaid.<br>  <br>  Or maybe the mermaid has to hold a rock with her, and without the rock in her hand or on her necklace, she turns back into a mermaid.|`|d3WiJVk6aa	I would suggest you look at the symbolism given to mermaids, and tie that symbolism into whatever device is used to make the change. (I'll try to find some links in a minute).<br>  <br>  Depending on what the story is about (besides a mermaid), it might be nice emphasize the choices involved in making the change to human form, no matter how that change takes place.  Is the mermaid giving up the ability to be a mermaid, or can she change back and forth?  Is she the victim of a trick, or is she trying to help someone in need?  Once the details surrounding the change are in place, the young author can find a symbolic gesture or event to represent that choice. <br>  <br>  (For example:  the mermaid gives up her ability to change from mermaid to human and back again so that she can help a stranger who's lost his memory in a shipwreck...maybe if she switches form with the help of an enchanted crab, and if she doesn't make it back to the tidal pools before high tide she wont be able to find the crab...she chooses to help the stranger but is stuck as a human unless she can find the enchanted crab - or the fairy who enchanted the crab in the first place.  The choice is to put the strangers need before her own, without knowing whether she'll be able to change back into a mermaid.)|`|9ocKwWvFaa	This idea may be a tad violent, but here it is anyway. <br>  <br>  She was attacked by a shark, and she was infected. When she was rescued (merman probably), to save her life they had to amputate her fish side. Then she says something like she really needs to move around but she can't since she can't swim without her lower half. Then a surgeon comes with an idea that she is given human legs. She takes the idea and gets human legs but something goes horribly wrong and she is catapaulted into the sand.|`|JnSrN3guaa	maybe the mermaid found a golden amulet with special powers and it grants her three wishes, and she wished to be a human.<br>  <br>  i like your first answer...

Their professors said their idea would not work, because it was flawed one way or another, depending on who was doing the criticism.<br>  <br>  I would say each of these 3 men listened to their own opinion and were already more educated than their teachers.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, it is never too much to say that everyone should learn everything he can even if he thinks it is wrong, because until he learns what he thinks is wrong, he doesn't know the wrong answer exists and cannot come up with the correct answer.<br>  <br>  As a famous person (I forget who) said: You never know what piece of seemingly foolish or unusable data will someday become valuable.

auOBJNEGaa	Firstly, what are you using this picture for?<br>  <br>  Depending on what the picture will be used for--if for a professional look:<br>  Work clothes (nothing flashy or excessive, something that would acceptable in an office)<br>  Light makeup (no foundation, light powder, a little mascara, chapstick)<br>  A neutral backdrop, such as against a gray or white wall<br>  <br>  Fun portrait--<br>  Wear whatever you want! <br>  Wear as much makeup as you want--just a tip though, if this picture is going to have any kind of retouching on the skin its best not to wear foundation because it covers up your skins natural texture. Wear light powder instead. <br>  Outside or another fun backdrop<br>  <br>  Since you've got brown hair and brown eyes I would suggest wearing plums, navys and deep forest greens. These will match your coloring very well. <br>  <br>  As for photoshopping your teeth, how much photoshop experience do you have? Its very easy for beginners to go way overboard on retouching, so if you feel you must keep in mind that retouching is supposed to look natural.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Damn, I was thinking this was inside job for the mob or CIA.<br>  What to wear for a head shot?

HCzS9cSZaa	It's kind of a stretch, but the book An Abundance of Katherines is about a boy genius who has dated nineteen girls named katherine and all of them dumped him.

Lock & Key by Sarah Dessen<br>  <br>   When she is abandoned by her acoholic mother, high school senior Ruby winds up living with Cora, the sister she has not seen for 10 years, and learns about Cora's new life, what makes a family, how to allow people to help her when she needs it, and that she too has something to offer others.<br>  <br>  2. Just Listen by Sarah Dessen<br>  <br>   Isolated from friends who believe the worst because she has not been truthful with them, sixteen-year-old Annabel finds an ally in classmate Owen, whose honesty and passion for music help her to face and share what really happened at the end-of-the-year party that changed her life.<br>  <br>  3. Keeping the moon by Sarah Dessen<br>  <br>   Fifteen-year-old Colie, a former fat girl, spends the summer working as a waitress in a beachside restaurant, staying with her overweight and eccentric Aunt Mira, and trying to explore her sense of self.<br>  <br>  4.

Bloom by Elizabeth Scott<br>  There's a difference between falling and letting go. Lauren has a good life: decent grades, great friends, and a boyfriend every girl lusts after. So why is she so unhappy? It takes the arrival of Evan Kirkland for Lauren to figure out the answer: She's been holding back. She's been denying herself a bunch of things because staying with her loyal and gorgeous boyfriend, Dave, is the "right" thing to do. After all, who would give up the perfect boyfriend? But as Dave starts talking more and more about their life together, planning a future Lauren simply can't see herself in and as Lauren's craving for Evan, and moreover, who she is with Evan becomes all the more fierce, Lauren realizes she needs to make a choice...before one is made for her.<br>  <br>  6.The truth about forever by Sarah Dessen<br>  <br>   The summer following her father's death, Macy plans to work at the library and wait for her brainy boyfriend to return from camp, but instead she goes to work at a catering business where she makes new friends and finally faces her grief.<br>  <br>  I have many many more but that will do for now.

Here's the back cover.<br>  <br>  Murder in the Mountains<br>  <br>  Rob Allen lost his youth and his leg in Iraq. Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means. A disciplinary transfer has displaced him from his native Manhattan into the secluded mountains of northern Pennsylvania. His fears of boredom are quickly replaced by a struggle for survival. When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains. They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.|`|Oq034KECaa	i highly suggest Twilight.<br>  love, action, edward...<br>  what else would a girl want to read about!?!|`|CBrVs8H5aa	well that depends on what your into...<br>  <br>  i have some female friends<br>  that read Jarhead, and Ghost Recon

KBBonf97aa	It's definitely a compliment.  Jane Bennet is main character's older sister and she's inherently decent.  As the family's great beauty, she's expected to marry well and thereby provide her family with some financial relief.  Elizabeth, the main character, is slightly younger than Jane and her father's favorite because of her level-headedness and unwillingness to suffer fools lightly.  The story is told from Elizabeth's point of view.  Jane provides a bit of contrast.  She's nearly as bright as her sister, but quieter, so people tend to judge her based on her beauty.  And whereas Elizabeth is inclined to leap to judgments about people's character, Jane is more optimistic and chooses to see the good in people, despite their failings.  Because Jane is shy and also beautiful, people underestimate her intelligence until they've gotten to know her.  When Jane's fiance cancels the engagement, it's Elizabeth who decries the injustice of it all, while Jane wishes her former boyfriend happiness because she loves him and wants that for him, whether it includes her or not.  She's actually a much more likeable character than Elizabeth.  It's a good book!  You should borrow your friend's copy when she's finished reading it!|`|suxCcXkAaa	All the previous answers are more or less right. If you check the link below, you can read a character analysis on Jane and get an in-depth description on what she's like =]|`|BzWQap1Haa	Jane Bennett is sweet and kind-hearted, the prettiest (and eldest) of her five sisters.

The world might be pretty similar today, but just without the whole genocide of the Jews thing.|`|hr0Ja7MTaa	During War World 1 if the Germs had of won by taking over Europe.. America would have then entered subsequently anyways and wiped out the German armies that were spread thin. <br>  Germany did not have that big of an army.. They were cocky .. and underestimated everyone around them. <br>  <br>  Eventually Britain would have created depth charges to blow up their submarines, <br>  ..spreading the armies thin would have caused the immediate death to the Germans as a people to begin with..<br>  America probably would have seen their chance and taken over all of Germany and Europe. The Germans would have been totally annihilated afterward either on the field or in prisons.  So Europe probably would have become owned by the States...if little Germany had of defeated France and went after Britain with some reasonable success. .. America would have definitely have helped Britain.. as it was Britain that had dragged America into the first world war to begin with.<br>  They might would have won the war had circumstances been different..but subsequently they would have lost control.|`|uaMvnHEYaa	not everyone would be speaking German, however we would have a verryyy different map. poland would be gone, the U.K. would be gone, most of europe would be german, and much of the middle east. the mexican government probably would have accepted the Zimmerman telegram from Germany, (If it really did exist) thus giving mexico arizona, new mexico, texas, california, and small parts of other states. WW2 wouldnt have happend by the way, hitler wouldnt have come to power, thus meaning (possibly) salvation for millions of jews, blacks, gays, and other races, and backrounds. it would be interesting. the U.S. might not exist also, but no one can be sure.|`|hCpqhn27aa	It probably would have been for the better in the long run, since the desolation of Germany following WWI is what allowed the Nazis to rise to power. So WWII probably wouldn't have happened. Also, much of Europe, including the UK might still be under German control, or at least German influence.<br>  <br>  I'm really not sure what effect WWI had on Russia, but if the Communists had still risen to power, the US would never have formed an alliance with them, since there would be no WWII to make it necessary. Thus, tensions between the US and Russia might have risen more quickly, leading a more direct conflict than what took place during the Cold War. So I suppose WWII might have wound up being the US vs. the USSR instead of US, UK, Russia vs. Germany, Italy, Japan. However, it would probably not have been a nuclear conflict, since, without the WWII as we know it, Einstein's life would have turned out a lot differently, delaying the development of nuclear weapons (which were based on Einstein's theories). And in a non-nuclear all-out-war between the US and the USSR set during the time of WWII, I'm guessing the USSR would have the edge, so the US might be a Communist nation today. And such a victory would likely have triggered a war between a German-led Europe and the Communist nations of the world. If Germany/Europe somehow managed to win that one, things might be back to normal by now, except with Europe under German power and the US in a lower position on the world scale. But if the USSR won such a war (as would be likely, given that they had enough time to recover from their fight with the US), Communists might well have taken over the world by now.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can say with fair certainty is that if Germany had won WWI, WWII as we know it probably would not have happened, which ultimately would have been for the better.<br>  But if my long series of dubiously speculative extrapolations is to be believed, that victory might also have led to the rise of global Communism. But probably not. :)<br>  <br>  Also, PEOPLE READ THE FRIGGIN' QUESTION BEFORE YOU ANSWER IT! It clearly says "World War ONE", not World War Two. I mean, seriously.|`|pgUfi7XMaa	If germany had won, most of the people in the world would have been jews right now and probably 1/10 of the world population would have been wiped out from executing from failure to follow german laws. thank god that isn't the case!|`|4JD3vavKaa	HEIL DER FUHRER|`|qlNfbBMvaa	everyone in the would would be speaking german

KBBonf97aa	I've heard bad things about Luna guitars, though I've never played one.  But they apparently have kind of fat necks and high action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard), which make them difficult to play.<br>  <br>  The best thing you could do is go to a guitar store and test drive a bunch of different guitars, since each will have its own feel.  Since you're just getting started, you'll probably want a guitar with a thin neck and low action.  Those things will make it easier to fret the strings and move around smoothly between chords.<br>  <br>  I agree with the other posters about Jasmine by Takamine guitars.  They have very thin necks and the bodies aren't so huge that they're cumbersome to play.  Ibanez also makes great guitars with thin necks that are often nicer than guitars costing twice as much.  A lot of people are partial to Epiphone guitars, but the necks tend to be fat, so those can be challenging for beginners and people with small hands (I'm one of the latter).  There are a lot of inexpensive guitars that are well-made, sound nice, and will last decades.  I've got an Ibanez acoustic I bought used more than 20 years ago and it's still one of my favorite guitars, since it plays like butter.<br>  <br>  If you want to do some research before trying guitars, Musician's Friend is a great resource.  You can search by brand, price or customer rating.  Guitarists also post reviews of instruments that will give you a good idea which guitars are great and which ones have "issues."  Here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/acoustic-guitars/6-string" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/acous...</a><br>  <br>  The most important thing is to choose a guitar that feels really comfortable and natural in your hands, since one person's dream guitar is another's nightmare.  When you visit a guitar store, be sure to see how each guitar feels when you play sitting down, since that's probably how you'll practice.  And don't let the sales weasels intimidate you or try to steer you toward a particular brand.  The way your guitar feels to you is far more important than the brand name on the headstock.  Trust your instincts.  Good luck!|`|0AUPrCMZaa	i agree with the above poster....  that guitar looks like rip off.<br>  <br>  i second the takamine - i have played them and for the money you can't go wrong.  this one is on sale and it comes in blue model and a red one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Jasmine-by-Takamine-ES450C-Quilttop-AcousticElectric-Guitar?sku=520095" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...</a>|`|o0MQRIIKaa	It doesnt look that good.<br>  Thats my opinion.<br>  I would get a Jasmine by Takamine.|`|f0zeXRrFaa	That is NOT a good guitar.

AA10729675	I am puzzled with this assignment.  It seems that the teacher does not understand "Hindu" philosophy.  He/she has some idea that Plato has copied something from India.  But he/she does not know what.<br>  There is no "Hindu" philosophy.  There is "Hindu" religion.  For the philosophy, one refers to Vedic texts, Vedanta, and Vedanga.  But not "Hindu" perspective.  And the Vedic idea was not dualist.  It is always One,  like the primordial sound OM.  It is non-dualist.  Also like the Tao.  One entity is made of Purusha and Shakti.  Shakti and Purusha make one.  But Plato's model of the tripartite psyche, that is something else.  Is it the driver of the chariot or coach?  And the horses?  And the chariot itself?  This is really childish so-called philosophy, really over-rated.  It comes from the times when Plato was among the few known philosophers and the idea of the soul pleased the Christians later on.  But it really is no philosophy at all.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I cannot help with this strange unbalanced question.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	At the core Hinduism is non dualism. It is almost atheism. There is only an awareness that is timeless and all pervading. It has no form or attributes. <br>  All that is perceived  is a manifestation on it much like a movie projected on a screen. The screen remains after the movie ends. <br>  <br>  So also the awareness. The 'I am that I am'.|`|CMy69Zx8aa	do u have phil 105 at sfsu?????

ohj5sRpsaa	1. "The forms of language that Shakespeare chose when writing certain characters determine not only how those characters would sound on stage, but how they develop as well. That is: the plot of the play is affected by linguistic form, just as it is affected by the (semantic) content of those forms. In the case of A Midsummer Night's Dream the character of Helena is a perfect example of this. The forms that her language falls into tell the audience much more about her than the content of the speech will get across. Though any random selection of lines from the play could show the same, lines 129-140 in Act 2, Scene 2 seem to be particularly susceptible to analysis in this fashion."<br>  <br>  The use of different language and rhyme and other things represents the characters and their different backgrounds, like royalty, lower class etc...<br>  <br>  2. -<br>  <br>  3. Linear pattern - the story moves forward, but in the end we see the same characters that opened the play ie., a full circle. <br>  <br>  I'm guessing..;<br>  <br>  4. Climax<br>  <br>  The play reaches its climax near the end of Act IV, after all of the lovers overcome their obstacles and leave for the temple to be united in marriage.  <br>  <br>  5. Nature and Animal Imagery<br>  <br>  Nature and animal imagery also abounds in the play, helping to maintain the “enchanted forest” atmosphere. Oberon’s description of the place where Titania sleeps is an example of this imagery:<br>  <br>        I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br>        Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br>        Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<br>        With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:<br>        There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br>        Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;<br>        And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,<br>        Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. (2. 1. 259-266)<br>  <br>  The song of the fairies in Act II, Scene II, is another example. It emphasizes the spooky creatures that inhabit the forest.<br>  <br>        You spotted snakes with double tongue,<br>        Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;<br>        Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,<br>        Come not near our fairy queen.<br>        Philomel,6 with melody <br>        Sing in our sweet lullaby;<br>        Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:<br>        Never harm,<br>        Nor spell nor charm,<br>        Come our lovely lady nigh;<br>        So, good night, with lullaby.<br>        Weaving spiders, come not here;<br>        Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!<br>        Beetles black, approach not near;<br>        Worm nor snail, do no offence. (2. 2. 12)<br>  <br>  6. Act 4, scene 2<br>  <br>  The nature of doubling emerges once again in this act, but for the last time. Hermia remarks that, "Methinks I see these things with parted eye, / When everything seems double" (4.1.186-7). This comment occurs right after Theseus has overridden Egeus' desires and agreed to let Hermia and Lysander get married. Hermia is correct about the fact that this is a doubling of marriages. In spite of escaping from the confusion of the forest, there is still a lingering uncertainty about whether Lysander and Demetrius have been able to distinguish between Helena and Hermia. The effect of having a double wedding merely makes the newfound differences more vague, making Hermia wonder if things still are in fact double.<br>  <br>  7. The story of Pyramus and Thisbe is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, stories about magical transformations. What are some of the transformations in the play? Consider both literal transformations ("Bless thee, Bottom! thou art translated!" [III.i.119-120]) and figurative ones (between day and night, discord and harmony, reality and dream, unhappiness and bliss). <br>  <br>  -<a href="http://cla.calpoly.edu/~dschwart/engl339/mnd.html" rel="nofollow">http://cla.calpoly.edu/~dschwart/engl339...</a>
f4Nn0W1xaa	Odds are, yes you can, especially if the book is not very thick. I find that rubber cement works best in those sorts of applications if you apply a thin layer to each surface and let it dry almost entirely. Then apply another thin layer, again to both surfaces, and adhere them together. Clamp or secure and let it dry undisturbed for a couple of days. Good luck! Books are fun to make.

BGU3VpQFaa	The cannibals were really messed up.  Reading those passages... Wow, very descriptive.  <br>  <br>  One of the things that would probably be the most horrifying is knowing how the world was before and having to survive now in this one that is totally unrecognizable. The boy in the book has no idea that things could be different, but is it better that way?  Probably.|`|fl8FKUs8aa	Throughout the whole book there are vivid descriptions of the landscape. One of the things I found the most horrifying was that group of men who gathered women and made them pregnant to use their babies as food.
ohj5sRpsaa	I'm sorry that you can't think of any - you must have not read the novel. <br>  <br>  1. To force Hassan to leave, Amir frames him as a thief, and Hassan falsely confesses. Baba forgives him, despite the fact that, as he explained earlier, he believes that "there is no act more wretched than stealing."<br>  <br>  <br>  Even in people with overwhelmingly noble qualities, there is usually a tragic flaw, which causes enormous problems for others and for him/her.  For example, Baba was a man torn between two halves.Amir is the society approved, legitimate half. Hassan, in contrast, is bastard and unprivileged half. Ironically, what had been pure and noble in Baba, was reflected by Hassan and what had been impure and ignoble had been reflected in Amir. In the most secret recesses of Baba's heart, he had thought of Hassan as his true son. From these painful reflections blossom the profound sense of forgiveness. By building an orphanage, feeding the poor and caring for Hassan, Baba had redeemed himself. By accepting the chance to be good again, Amir also had redeemed himself. So, Rahim Khan is right in asking Amir to forgive your father and forgive yourself.The greater virtue is in forgiveness and not in Revenge.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ottawavalleybookclub.com/wordpress/?p=57" rel="nofollow">http://www.ottawavalleybookclub.com/word...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  There's plenty more, but I haven't read the book in a couple years.
Fnp2MIycaa	Main Aztec Weapons<br>  <br>  Slings, bows and arrows, knives and spears were the main Aztec weapons of choice. <br>  The Aztecs had weapons like dart and spear throwers which were called Atlatl. The Atlatl is a very effective weapon that can often be seen with a warrior. Lots of murals or paintings depict warriors carrying this weapon in their hands. <br>  Another weapon is the Macuahitl, which is basically a wooden club that has obsidian on its edges. Macuahitl means “hand stick”. This weapon is said to be one of the, if not the most powerful weapon of the Aztecs. This weapon is commonly seen with the elite warriors and not with the commoners. To carry a powerful weapon such as this is one of the perks of having captured a lot of prisoners and being a high ranked person. <br>  <a href="http://www.aztec-history.net/aztec_weapons" rel="nofollow">http://www.aztec-history.net/aztec_weapo...</a><br>  <br>  Maya Weapons & Warfare.<br>  Some of their spectacular weapons were:<br>  1. Bow and Arrow<br>  A projectile weapon used for long range combat. This weapon was created approxamatly 2,500 years ago.<br>  2. Knife<br>  A close range blade used for stabbing.<br>  3. Spear<br>  An either close or long range weapon. It is a long pole with a blade at the tip. It could be thrown or used as a sabbing weapon.<br>  4. Atlatl (spear thrower)<br>  A device used for throwing the spear. The spear was placed in a groove on the Atlatl then the atlatl was strapped to the arm. After throwing the spear the tip of the spear (a dart) was projected out of the spear into the pray. After the battle was over the spear part (not the dart) could be retrived.<br>  5. Club (maquahuitl)<br>  This was somewhat like a log used to crush the enemy, not stab them. The club was widely used.<br>  6. Sickle<br>  A curved blade used for cutting grass. It could also be used for battle.<br>  <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0310200/mayawp.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0310200/...</a>

t9mHCugUaa	George Washington. He kept America in the war until the French help could be brought to bear. He was irreplaceable.<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson's involvement during the war other than drafting the Declaration of Independence was minimal. Being Kicked out of Virginia as its governor had minimal effect on the war.|`|AA11442722	Jefferson was the most influential idea man. He and Ben Franklin provided the core of the Constitution, bill of rights and ideals of the revolution. Washington's contributions were primarily to keep the nation's military alive and to prevent us from turning the first president into a king. Both were important but Jefferson's were essential. The US could have found other military leaders and a first president.|`|D19F6m92aa	George Washington is called the father of our country for a reason.  No other leader could have kept the army together, while keeping the army under the control of a civilian government.  Never before or since has any leader done this.<br>  No other general, maybe Greene, could have led the army so well.  General Charles Lee, conspired to overthrow the government and almost lost the battler Mammoth.  Gates, let his ego get in the way and almost lost the battle of Saratoga.  Washington lost most of his battles, but not because of poor leadership.<br>  Washington thought outside the box by making retreat, into victory.  Washington realized that america could afford to lose a city, providing he could keep the army intact.  Washington's only fault was he was too willing to fight.<br>  Washington kept the army intact through four horrible winters.  No European army would have survived Valley Forge, let alone two at Mammoth Springs.<br>  Jefferson was a philosopher, diplomat, politician.  But I think Franklin was more important, and Adams was more important.<br>  we would still be saying God save the Queen, if it was not for Washington.
XEbrGfZuaa	Those who headed west first, had it the hardest. For there were no<br>  well traveled roads made by wagon wheels, as there were ten years<br>  or more later. Husbands had a book they'ed bought at the starting off<br>  point, in St Lous, Missouri, which gave landmarks to mark the trail to head west. They called it, The Oregon Trail. People went anyway<br>  they could. Many of them walked the entire way west. There were<br>  some who had fancy carriages, that they assumed would carry them<br>  the entire trip with their choicest of horses. Many camped out each<br>  night under the stars, and had only one wagon to hold their household<br>  goods and food. Since there were no way stations along the way, it<br>  was up to the men of each wagon, to find water and shoot wildlife when it was available. Even if it was just a jack rabbit on the prairie. Some pioneers had the foresight to buy medicines that they were told would be of major help to keep them alive. But not many were that prepared. And often they drank tainted water, and got sick and many died before reaching the last lap of the trip, in Oregon territory. It was a mish mash of people. From farmers to lawyers to those trying to avoid the war between the states, and orchardists who were anxious to plant fruit trees to provide fruit in a couple of years to those who could afford their prices. There were sheep men, and cattle men with<br>  small herds.Many of which were headed for California at the cut off after leaving the great Salt Lake, in Utah territory.. Everyone came with the hope of finding their pot at the end of the rainbow. As there were more wagons heading west over time, the roads became well grooved, and you can see some areas today, that still mark the wagons wheels. <br>       Many young men and women kept diaries of their trips west. And<br>  they told of the hardships they experienced. And the births, as well<br>  as the deaths along the way. It took many months to make this trip.<br>  And people had to leave the east, at the right time of the year, to avoid<br>  becoming trapped in the mountain snows of winter. Many people ran<br>  out of food when they reached the great Mount Hood. And some had<br>  to stay while others from their party went on ahead to civilization and<br>  bring what food they still had money for, back. Animals were tired,<br>  some had given out further back on the trail. These people had <br>  walked the rest of the way. Often being aided by others to allow them<br>  to put some possessions in their wagons. The mules seemed to have<br>  been the heartiest to make the entire trek. The horses gave out, as<br>  they couldn't handle the long hard mountain climbs and having to<br>  endure, until they were able to find water. Oxen were generally used<br>  for they could pull heavy loads. But they too gave out for the most<br>  part, unless they were allowed to walk slowly and bedded down<br>  early at night. The urgency to reach the Willamette Valley of Oregon<br>  kept the pioneers plodding ahead. Through rain and wind and days<br>  as hot as Hades. Women rubbed lard on their faces to protect from<br>  the wind and sun. When it rained, everything got wet. And often some<br>  wagons had to lay over for a day or two,  to dry out bedding.<br>  It was a trip, that most would never have to make a second time. And<br>  for those lucky enough to reach the Pacific Northwest, or the<br>  land in California, they knew what they had accomplished. And they<br>  were eager to start over again, in land so rich and plentiful and it was<br>  beautiful when they got their first glance. While some prospered, not<br>  all did. And some returned to their former homes in the east. But the<br>  courageous remained, and fought hard and long, to make their claims.<br>  And a few, even went so far, as to see the Pacific Ocean for the first<br>  time. And they discovered they'ed found their little bit of heaven there. For the white tipped waves, crasked to shore and the contrast of sky and water, were all those people needed to see. They were home. And home was where they'ed always be.|`|AA11442722	Wagon trains were common after a time. The early days it was more sprawl than migration.

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	The process of cultural transformation (proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox) was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw. Andrew Jackson was the first U.S. President to implement removal of the Native Americans with the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. In 1831 the Choctaw were the first to be removed, and they became the model for all other removals. After the Choctaw, the Seminole were removed in 1832, the Creek in 1834, then the Chickasaw in 1837, and finally the Cherokee in 1838.<br>  <br>  The Choctaw nation was in what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. After a series of treaties starting in 1801, the Choctaw nation was reduced to 11,000,000 acres (45,000 km2). The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ceded the remaining country to the United States and was ratified in early 1831. The removals were only agreed to after a provision in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek allowed some Choctaw to remain.<br>  <br>  The Seminoles were part of the Creek Nation who lived in Florida, originally Spanish territory. They fought and lost two wars.<br>  <br>  Andrew Jackson ignored the 1815 Treaty of Ghent and in 1825 the Creek Nation signed the Treaty of Indian Springs. Although later anulled, this was the basis for the Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March 24, 1832, which divided up Creek lands into individual allotments. Creeks could either sell their allotments and received funds to remove to the west, or stay in Alabama and submit to state laws. Land speculators and squatters began to defraud Creeks out of their allotments, and violence broke out, leading to the so-called "Creek War of 1836." Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.<br>  <br>  Unlike other tribes who exchanged land grants, the Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836 the Chickasaws had reached an agreement that purchased land from the previously removed Choctaws after a bitter five-year debate. They paid the Choctaws $530,000 for the western most part Choctaw land.<br>  <br>  he Cherokee Trail of Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota, an agreement signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which exchanged Native American land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River, but which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people.<br>  <br>  Tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1829, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the first gold rush in U.S. history. Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure began to mount on the Georgia government to fulfill the promises of the Compact of 1802.<br>  <br>  When Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee tribal lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokees were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case. However, in Worcester v. State of Georgia (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government — not state governments — had authority in Indian affairs.<br>  Jackson had no desire to use the power of the national government to protect the Cherokees from Georgia, since he was already entangled with states’ rights issues in what became known as the nullification crisis. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees to sign a removal treaty.|`|6Pckjqlsaa	whites --> indian territories and force the indian to leave|`|Ws8hKszRaa	the creek war were Andrew Jackson wipped up on the indians

n843aGrEaa	The heart of socialism is equality. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels summed up its aim with a simple slogan: "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need."<br>  <br>  This basic concept infuriates the bosses and their ideologies. They reject the idea of a society without power and privilege for a small group. They complain that under socialism, everyone would be paid the same amount. This is true. Roughly speaking, people would receive the same thing--there’s no reason for it to work any other way.<br>  <br>  "Aha!" comes the response. "You’d pay a brain surgeon the same as you’d pay a truck driver! Then no one would put in the work to become a brain surgeon."<br>  <br>  Such a statement is telling about the priorities of capitalist society--that the only reason people would try to heal the sick is for money. Without financial incentive, the logic goes, no one will pursue work that requires a lot of education, training, and skill.<br>  <br>  What a travesty! Socialism would be about giving people the opportunity to do what they really want. It would encourage them to become doctors, scientists, artists, or anything else they might desire--unlike now, where people’s access to education is limited by their access to cash.<br>  <br>  Capitalism actually stifles people’s creativity. Only a minority of people are asked to put their minds to the running of society--and most of them do it for the purpose of making themselves richer, not for achieving any common good.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  Socialists are among the best fighters in the struggles of today. But we’re also involved in the struggle for the future--ultimately, for a different kind of society where exploitation and oppression are never known again. That is the vision of a society that we put forward--and the struggle to make that vision open to larger numbers of people is the way that socialists put the best of themselves forward.<br>  <br>  We live in a rotten and barbaric world. For millions of people, just surviving each day is intolerably difficult. For the rest of the vast majority, the struggle to get by leaves almost no time for leisure--much less for putting our minds to making the world a better place to live. Capitalism has produced poverty, famine, environmental catastrophe, and bloody war.<br>  <br>  To hear defenders of the system explain it, these horrors are inevitable. It may not be a perfect world, we’re told, but it’s the best we can do.<br>  <br>  What a sick society it is that tells us that 6 million children dead of malnutrition each year is the best we can do. Or that more than 1.5 million Iraqis killed by economic sanctions is the best we can do. Or that a world threatened by ecological devastation is the best we can do.<br>  <br>  We know that we can do better. The resources exist to eliminate all of these horrors--and to build a socialist society free of poverty and oppression where we all have control over our lives.<br>  <br>  That is a world worth fighting for.|`|lUe4rReZaa	There are only three things worth fighting for, God, Country, and Family. and not necessarily in that order.|`|AA11442722	Freedom<br>  Your ideals<br>  To create a better life for your children.<br>  To protect your way of life <br>  To prevent great evil from being done to others (ie Nazis, La Razza or any other racist hate group from taking power)|`|RH8Ncf36aa	Fighting for fighting is good enough, I would rather fill the cups of others with my fight.

Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something. <br>  Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam? <br>  Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for. <br>  <br>  so my answer is the same "that there is some good in this world...and its worth fighting for"|`|spYpsixUaa	I'll sign up for the fight against violence.

AA10729271	It's funny, I've taken courses that sound like the one you're taking, at it also seemed to me that they often made things more complicated than necessary. <br>  <br>  That being said, I would see it more as a practise, what you really want to do is focus on each aspect as you study it (character development, plot, setting, dialogue, etc) and don't really worry about taking all the things you've learnt and putting them into a novel until the end. It may seem like you're overdoing it, but it's more about building up automatic skills, so when you actually work on your book you do all those things without even having to think about them. Like the way dancers practise the same moves over and over so that when they have to actually perform the moves are natural and automatic. <br>  <br>  What i would do is to put your 'main' idea aside, the story idea that your are trying to develop, and come up with a new idea just for this course, that way you wont confuse your favourite theme during the practising, and you might just develop another story idea you will also be proud of. then come back the the main idea when you're done and see if the course gives you a fresh look at it. This is what I do in these situations, I keep story idea's I came up with outside of class, well, outside of class, because sometimes I'm not sure if I wan't them to be 'tainted' by acedemic principles, and then create idea's soley for the class itself, this seperation is helpful because you can develope the new idea without having to worry you are moving too far away from your original artistic inspriation.|`|AA10953561	I've taken several courses on writing, and honestly some of them were very helpful and others were not worth the money I paid for them. It sounds like you got one of the let downs. You can really learn a lot and I would reccomend trying to get as much as possible out of this course. <br>  <br>  I don't know what all you already know, but if you want to expand knowledge or just talk with someone who has been writing for a while (and is published) feel free to e-mail me. I'm not famous or anything, just another writer.|`|Vraywn6Vaa	The course may serve you well but courses like these often confuse.Writing is not a template driven activity and too often courses provide templates on "the right way to do it'.<br>  <br>  You best teacher by far is the work of others, not in an analytical but from a reading for pleasure sense. Too often a course will tell you 'what the author meant.' Firstly, how do they know, unless he left a note? Secondly, why does there have to be one answer?<br>  <br>  I'm reminded of Picasso's Guernica. (A painting). He deliberately didn't say what each element meant, leaving everyone much richer from a plethora of interpretations.<br>  <br>  Much of what I write is for the fun in it. I'd hate to think of people finding deeper motives. Too many authors have suffered that - Dickens, Carroll, Barrie - to name three of the more obvious ones.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, these courses are English refresher courses. They tell people they can write. Ok, they can write, but can they tell a story?|`|fkwYvFBRaa	No, not really. How you want your writing experience to be like is entirely up to you. You can learn writing from all kinds of sources and if you think this is something that can help you, why not? :)
LEp7IFdvaa	some good images here...I hear the Rubaiyat's "awake" echoed more than once in your lines, which is good because it casts a parallel about not wasting the day, drinking each day's cup until it's dry, etc.  The only awkward line, to me, is "arise on forest mountain" because it seems like it's missing an "a" or a "the".  Other than that, nicely done.|`|wOsJ1QEYaa	i like it its got a good flow... but what is it about?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309212852AAyPJiD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
ceBTTCPwaa	The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.<br>  <br>  The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html</a>|`|gIzJaGTZaa	SPOILER ALERT<br>  Gatsby changes his identity for Daisy. He does not love her, but he loves the idea of her ( a beautiful, young rich girl whose voice sounds like "money") . He creates this dashing young man persona to win her love. He always made himself sound/seem better than what he was, and bent the truth a lot in order to protect himself as well as the ones he loved. <br>  <br>  In the end, he ends up taking the blame for Daisy and is  murdered after using his pool for the first time. This is extreme irony. <br>  <br>  Gatsby always wants what he cant have. As a kid, he has no money, so he makes it his main purpose in life. Then he goes for Daisy, trying to buy her with his new objects. He does not realize that he does not have the correct "currency" in this case (so to speak). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

8KWwoRefaa	There is noway possible that you could mentally break God. He did come to earth as a human, Jesus.

You can't fool God because you are God being YOU.  So there is nothing you can do to fool God or "mess with God's mind."  God already knows what you are thinking as you think it, knows every intention you have ever had, every thought, word and deed, in fact.  Your life is bare naked before God and there is no where you can go that God has not already been.  Nothing is hidden, you are totally transparent.  So really, the joke is always on YOU.  You cannot "outsmart," "outthink," "outmaster."  You are not anywhere near being at even the most primitive level of thought let alone tapped into the highest one.  In fact, if God were to so choose, he could totally mess you up (but due to the fact that God is LOVE, that won't happen - God is eternally patient with your kind of thinking and even is amused by the attempts).|`|AA11894640	Now that's what I call "Wishful Thinking"!|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Whether god is a person or not, but humans r mentally and spiritually breaking him down, by their sins and actions, hatred, terrorism, world war 3, nuclear war etc. <br>  Brother kill brother, many innocent children and woman and civilians r killed, innocent blood is shed, and does not innocent blood cry to god for protection and justice ?<br>  God is a very sensitive entity (whether human or not) does he not break down mentally and spiritually ?

6KTYAexsaa	No, I don't have this problem as well, because when I write, I find it as a chance for me to be creative. It's a chance for you to describe things in your own way. Just think of how you could make the descriptions more original, but if you can't, I guess you could rearrange in your own words what other have written, but I don't recommend it cause it's kinda like plagiarizing.|`|hcqNXUH5aa	I think you need to physically visit places and write what you see.  Also, try to become more observant.  Anytime you go anywhere, or even when you're hanging around your house, notice everything.  See, touch, smell, taste, listen... all the time.<br>  <br>  And perhaps purchase a few books on scenes:<br>  Make a Scene: Craft a Story One Scene at a Time  by: Jordan E.

I often have to go back and re-write scenes to give them more description, and there is nothing wrong with that.|`|PToFyrz5aa	cheat, thats what i do, NO I dont plagiarize. But I use something I read in a mark twain story,<br>  <br>  sammy said something like if they have the words borrow them, and one day you might return them, so whats the bother? <br>  every writer needs words, look to other writers for words, you will find them in your favorite author.|`|AA11554181	Just picture it in your head. Don't use other peoples words.|`|SOd54uTkaa	I'm a writer too. I'm 15 and busy with school, so it's obvious I'm unpublished lol. But what i do is I'll look up pictures on google and type in "medieval castle" or "birthday party" and describe what you see. Also, you don't have to go into deep deep detail. Sometimes readers will like to know basic things and then use their imagination for the rest. I do the google image thing for people, houses, etc. too.|`|JdtLTvRGaa	ok so ur if ur doin sumthin on medieval times, ur really gonna hav 2 brush up on ur knowledge of wat the buildings were made out of, clothing, etc. as for other scenes such as birthday parties, think of ur own parties uv had over the years, wat were they like? to be a writer doesn't necessarily mean u hav to describe everything to perfect detail though.|`|HYbYkcPPaa	Oh dear.   That's just plain old cheating.  Instead of reading other people's text, look at photographs instead and just describe what you see.  If you run out of words, you don't know enough words.  Use similies and metaphors instead of direct observations too.|`|wwwiWaK8aa	Describing anything in words, scenes, buildings, anything, are usually based on some memory you have. Chances are you need to read a bit more descriptive works.<br>  It would help if when you need to describe something, you close your eyes and play it in your mind. Say you want to describe a fight scene in  a cafe: close your eyes and think of your favourite cafe. Think about it in detail, look at the walls, the tables, the guy behind the counter. Then imagine the people in your book walking into the cafe and sitting down. Make it their cafe. Think of the drinks they would order, where they would sit, what they are wearing...<br>  <br>  Descriptions are based on details, you need to find a way to visualise these details so you can put them down on paper.

When thinking hurts too much, just stop doing it!  Especially if your thinking hurts other people.<br>  <br>  I have a big secret for you  -  sometimes, it is better to leap than to look.  I got this one from The Big Man in the Sky.<br>  <br>  On the whole, when your thoughts lead to destructiveness, when they result in negative outcomes which neither serve you or others - learn from your experiences!  Your experience will always be your best teacher.<br>  <br>  Just remember this - mind always wants to be in control of YOU.  The trick is to learn how to put YOU in control of your mind.  Most people have run-away minds, walking through life like zombies, or on automatic pilot, being reactionary then pro-active.  Learn to become AWARE of your thoughts.  Think about your thoughts.  When your thoughts do not serve yourself or others, decide to change your thoughts to something else. It takes a lot of courage and long term will power to change your thinking habits.<br>  <br>  When something is destructive or reckless, be AWARE of what you are doing and change your thought.  Decide to change it to something different.  Refuse to put energy into thought you cannot control and that leads to self-destructive behaviors.<br>  <br>  One last thought here - you are ALWAYS in charge of YOU.  And, you are always responsible for the thoughts you think.  There is no escaping responsibility and blaming others for your thoughts.  Work to create positive thought at all times, and when you notice your thoughts are becoming destructive or irrational, see them for what they are and change that immediately.  You are in control at all times, get off of auto-pilot.  Stop being reactionary.  Create pleasant thoughts in your mind at all times.  See every adversarial situation as your challenge to do better with YOU.|`|iwpwC93maa	They do. I guess most would call it "Chronic Over thinking". I don't know if I should call it a good or bad thing. Logically though, you could argue that thinking so much leads to development of the mind and intelligence, through serving as a mental exercise. On the other hand though, what if your thoughts are heading into the wrong direction. Down that path you'll find anxiety perhaps? - that's no good. <br>  <br>  All in all, a man should probably only think as fast as he runs I suppose. Call it spiritual equilibrium I guess..|`|b138671ae3255ea398ff2f873fbf25e8aa	Well does the running man have 2 legs??? Ok that was sick humor...but humor is still a good thing..my mind runs like a marathon runner every damn day.....sometimes so much, I can't even sleep!|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	I've encountered that very few times in my life so I've had to consciously and with effort slow myself down in my thinking.  But there are other times in my thinking where like a game I consciously change thought from one step to the next.  One of the astonishing things is with the mind one can think on things real and unreal yet it can remain tangible thought with full substance.  Imagination is the closest thing to having spiritual substance since it is not locked in by time,space, or place.   <br>  <br>  I put barriers to my thoughts.  Nothing negative or evil or hurtful or harmful.  But always something profound to ponder about.  I've lived in this area for so long that my mind goes there automatically wherever I go.  I follow a thinking man's guide that says whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are of good report, to think about these things.  So it's like meditation to me.  Just me and God looking at the world and sharing our thoughts about it.  I always want to hear what he says to me.<br>  <br>  Later.|`|87231731cb32c6abdb725130f208078daa	Lets just say if it was the tortoise versus the hair. My thoughts would be considered the tortoise.

QE2hNXeCaa	He wasn't terminally ill but before the family left Tobolsk he was severely injured as he played on a sled inside the house. One of his legs was in bad shape and he was not able to walk ever again.It is possible that he would have remained disabled for the rest of his life as a consequence of this accident had he not been murdered. I do not know how medicine worked at the time, it is slightly possible for him to die of weaknesses. Staying in bed for long causes your lungs to become frail and you become weaker and weaker.<br>  <br>  A: it was speculated that he tried to hurt himself on purpose in Tobolsk. I don't if this can be verified or not but he surely was depressed. The quotes from Alexandra's diary about how he was not afraid of death but he feared for what would occur to them in the house says a lot about his mood. If his will to live was really gone he would not have lasted long, suicidal ideation or not. None of the Romanovs would have stood a life so unfamiliar to them. It was either be saved or be killed.<br>  <br>  B: It is hard to tell. Physicians told Nikolai that Alexis would not make it into adulthood when he was considering abdication on the imperial train. From what I know he the normal childhood of a hemophiliac and he survived it, not without health consequences but I think he would have lived a long life if the family had been removed from Siberia. At the same time, his life would always be somewhat frail. His great uncle Prince Leopold of the UK died on haemophilia as an adult so the dangers were still there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: chronically ill is not the same as terminally ill. At the time, as it is with other diseases today, haemophilia was a chronical illness that often resulted in death but medically and historically speaking he was not doomed to die. If he had other conditions such as tuberculosis or cancer then yes, this would have been a terminal illness and there is no doubt he would have died. At the time haemophilia was a deadly but not necessarily fatal disease.|`|AA12095483	He was terminally ill. There was no cure for hemophilia - and there isn't one today - but the condition can be controlled by blood transfusions. There were no blood transfusion for Alexei as that technique had not been developed yet. <br>  Alexei would have died no matter where he and his family lived.|`|9Eq2Xxbmaa	lol WOW you're obsessed with Alexei Romanov ALMOST as much as i used to be =P<br>  <br>  a) he WOULD NOT have lived long, especially after he got on the sled and slid down the steps. that accident would've left him crippled for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  b). if they would've been exiled to Great Britain, or the U.S. (etc) i believe he would've lived, he just would've been very weak and frail. he wouldn't have been able to take over the throne (probably).|`|CABcchsraa	Your best clue would be to look at the lives of the other European Royal children that Queen Victoria passed hemophilia on to.  As far as I know most died in childhood from unhealing injuries.  Two grandchildren of Victoria with hemophilia in the Spanish and Danish Royal families managed to live to adulthood but died in their twenties.  Unfortunately one popular treatment to injuries by haemophiliacs was to drain the blood from swelling areas under the skin where the blood was building up - obviously not the best thing fro someone who's blood doesn't clot.|`|AA10075267	of all the bodies found in 1990s, two were missing. alexi and his sister anastasia. many believe they were squirreled away by the local people who felt the younger two didn't deserve to die in such a manner. no, the romanov's were not taken from russia and lived somewhere else. his cousin, king george of england, refused to take his cousin nicolas romanov, et al, into england. king george V lived to regret his decision. the usa also refused, as well.  i'm not sure if the romanov's would've left russia anyway. now, alexi's condition was not terminal but could've been if he wasn't treated when cut or harmed. the royal disease, hemophilia, dogged him from birth and would've been with him forever. the girls were spared but if they lived to have boy children, well, their kids would not have been spared. the disease is pro-male passed through their mothers and very present in european royalty. it is what you get when you have too-similar genetic structure (mating that is too close to incest). cousins marrying cousins, etc. this was very common with europeans and especially royalty.

The Nazis who worked in the concentration camps or in connection with them, but soldiers especially on the eastern front did not.

Also took a month since there are 7 books so it would keep you occupied for a while.<br>  <br>  Added Bonus - it ties in to the other books you have read by SK and links everything together in a weird, Kingish way.<br>  <br>  If you have already tried those (I tried The Gunslinger for years before I actually got into it and then I could not stop) then I would suggest The Posionwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. I really, really enjoyed that book. I still do.<br>  <br>  There's always The Herion Diaries by Nikki Sixx if you are in for a supremely shocking true novel.<br>  <br>  So many books, so little time. My librarian knows me very well. :)|`|6KTYAexsaa	Great expectations is a wonderful book. It may be long, but it's just so great! Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is another book I would recommend.

wFBVuBOkaa	In my opinion they don't represent courtly love at all, as he seduced her and most concepts of courtly or fine love are not to be consummated. For example, in the King Arthur stories it was perfectly acceptable and even encouraged for Lancelot to take up a banner of courtly love for Guinevere, but the major sin was in moving to physical love. And for Pete's sake, Abelard and Heloise got married after she got pregnant. Proper courtly love certainly does not result in pregnancy. There were even written rules both lamenting and codifying courtly love in the period of Abelard and Heloise, though it was not called by that term until centuries later. The definitive work on the subject is very firm.<br>  <br>  It is, however, true that after Heloise's uncle cut off "Little Abelard" and sent Heloise to a convent that not only was Abelard physically unable to "play the field" ever again, but they had to take their relationship to letters which is probably where they should have kept it in the first place.<br>  <br>  It depends on whether you're asking for a lay definition of courtly love, a high school test's very simplistic and usually erroneous understanding of courtly love, or a college medieval lit or history class's deconstruction of Abelard and Heloise. As an undergraduate, my medieval lit final as well as my capstone medieval history final asked for an analysis of courtly love using Abelard and Heloise as well as successful examples; the answer they wanted was that Abelard and Heloise illustrated what happens when courtly love is violated, not followed.|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	Courtly refers to formality of their stations.  You couldn't just knock boots in proper society-especially when the girl is betrothed to another.   So they had to put up a fake front to hide their love from the people who mattered.

lGg8AU1Yaa	This poem is not necessarily a love poem, but more of a celebration of the subject's beauty. Some critics have said that Byron fell passionately in love with his cousin and wrote this poem for her. He met her for the first time while she was in mourning over the death of a loved one. Thus, in modest black dress (hence the allusions to darkness, with the light referring to her beauty) Lord Byron encountered his cousin, known for her great beauty, and was taken aback. Nowhere in the poem does Byron mention or allude to love.

Well, I dont know how old you are, but when I was a bit younger I read this trilogy of books called The Darkangel Trilogy. The first book is called the Darkangel and the author is Meredith Ann Pierce. Theyre a bit old actually, i think they were written in the 80's. But these were the books that got me into vampire stories in the first place. What I like about these is that the vampire in the story is very different from most of the vampire books back then or even nowadays. It also happens in a completely different world and it can be a bit cheesy at times but I still read it and I love it. The image that she paints of the vampire in the book gives me very pleasant shivers lol!|`|fl8FKUs8aa	In the Forests of the Night<br>  Demon in My View<br>  Midnight Predator<br>  <br>  All of these are by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes...<br>  <br>  When you are ready for more adult content I suggest the Dark series by Christine Feehan :)

RkfJ36q2aa	Personally, I loved the book, at first. <br>  This is coming from a girl who read it way before it started getting big (about two years before, actually.) <br>  <br>  I did think it was kind of weird, reading a book about vampire, but I loved it. I thought it was well written, and fabulous. When it started getting big, and the movie came out, I was sick of it. When I saw the actors in the movie, I literally gagged. <br>  <br>  The movie was horrible, and now the book is overrated.<br>  If you read this and are a Twilight virgin, PLEASE do not read it.

I know she must have had to finish it pretty quickly, but it was like the editor did nothing. Also, whenever I need to look up "twilight" for the time of the night, it comes up with the book and the movie and what people think about it. It is dampening my irked soul. <br>  It was good, but not so good that millions of people need to obsess over it and constantly talk about how much they just 'loooove Edward Cullen'... ehh. <br>  My poor, poor irked soul.|`|SOd54uTkaa	I didn't mind the romance part, but the ideas are kinda weird.

I do know many people that couldn't stand it though. Partially because of the overzealous fans but mainly just because of the story itself.

I do think the series became worse as I went on.)|`|NYiUYTnJaa	It is horrible if you are reading to sustain your intelligence.<br>  <br>  It does not follow vampire lore; it changes many important factions of vampires (sunlight, etc) and that totally turned me off.<br>  <br>  The dialogue is absolutely terrible.<br>  <br>  Unless you are a tween.

WJLl0d3Jaa	Basically, if you want to go shooting with a DSLR body you need balls. You may be more prone to become a target for muggers, you will stand out a bit more than those with a rangefinder or P&S, and people will stare (although not everyone). Once you get past the fear of walking up to people and taking photos with the bulky DSLR, you're home scottfree.<br>  <br>  It's really all that it is, getting past your fear of people, of strangers, in a location that you cannot control (the streets). Some folks might flame me, some might agree, but that's all it boils down to, get your camera, stick the lens in a passerby's face, shoot, smile, continue down the road. Truth is, most people are just too damn busy to care or notice you. The few that do will likely ask you what you're doing, just answer you're a street photag, be honest and open with them.<br>  <br>  If you're on a public sidewalk, they cannot make you erase their photo. Anything that can be viewed from a public location is fair game. If someone gets overly confrontational, be polite, use common sense, walk away.<br>  <br>  Here is a Very Good site that will help you out, not many people seem to know of it: <a href="http://2point8.whileseated.org/wow-footer/" rel="nofollow">http://2point8.whileseated.org/wow-foote...</a>|`|AA10729271	Well, in my art class our teacher insists that we have any subject sign a photo release form if we want to use it for a project, she provides us with the form.|`|mZrydsoKaa	Your best bet for starting out as a beginning photographer is to get a book about basic photography OR take a class at your local community college. <br>  As far as taking pictures of people, from my experience, it is always a good idea to give someone notice that you are taking their picture. It is a VERY good idea to ask the parent before taking pictures of their children.|`|oXPDFw4daa	You didn't say where you are - prohibitions against photography, if they exist, are typically a function of local law and tradition.<br>  <br>  There are three general situations in which photography is prohibited.<br>  <br>  1.  In some places, photography is prohibited as a matter of law.  This is often the case in the vicinity of military or government installations.  You need to determine what the laws are where you live.<br>  <br>  2.  Photography may be ill-advised in areas where there are strong traditions of personal privacy or where capturing images of individuals violates religious beliefs.  Examples include photographing some Native American people, photographing women in Arab countries, or photographing in some parts of Africa.  <br>  <br>  3.  Photography may be banned on private property.  This is commonly the case in shopping malls where the owners choose to prohibit photography both to avoid irritating shoppers and to avoid congestion.|`|AJopJTuxaa	Their are no laws in taking pictures. If their is prohibition, usually, they stop you at the door.

The police cannot do a thing about it . I had tthose issues. Nothing wrong with that because, you can always tell them that you like the look or make up a story.<br>  Same for public buildings. Anybody can take pics of moving cars, people, food etc..etc... Photography is an art and you are doing just that.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	There is a lot of confusion as to what is okay and what isn't...

Those come down to you and you alone.  You can ask all you want, but you'll always get people on both sides of the fence.
03k5qduQaa	Self is personal individual identity, that which sets you apart from your peers, a characteristic of personage from the peer will. The self is ones subconscious, a template of a life’s experience all amalgamated to create a potent reactor and force of will. In its positive aspect it is the mark of distinction setting apart a great visionary, free thinker, independent spirit, a detached and transcendental soul. In its negative facet it is a cauldron of blind anger, festering rage, seething hatred, burning resentment and ingrained and fiercely held ignorance serving this toxic brew within a singular person. It is then something to be overcome, reconciled or eliminated prior to its contributing to the demise of a person’s character. <br>  <br>  The self is ones soul, ones individual personality and identity. The illumined soul perceives itself in all men great and small and focuses upon the universal thread and life force coursing through all. Those trapped in dark caves of self contained, ostracised angst becomes as reactors of a perverse random will exploited by the pervading negative eons to propagate division for the purpose of power and transference of accountability and blame upon the said hapless victim of self. <br>  <br>  This is where confusion arises in that the Higher Self is something to be aspired towards, recognised, understood, focused upon until one becomes as a supernal and surreal perfect being. The self or the ego of the I must be abandoned and the will submitted to the greater {if only greater in mass} of the collective will, no matter what the driving force or factor of that will me be. Two facets of a positive absolute of Self whether in its higher illumined state or its entrapped imprisoned light.<br>  <br>  One to be aspired towards the other to gain liberation from ...|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	Hm. How about, the crudest criteria might be, intentionality (awareness, thought, consciousness), and agency (functional separation from surroundings, origination of action). <br>  <br>  I guess I'd say "a self" is a consciousness that identifies with its subjective point of view, and holds itself to be bounded and separate from the world of objects.

spYpsixUaa	i don't think that the comparison between "house" and "home" would make sense to you, but the difference between "Home" and "homemaker" would.  The brain is the home of the mind.  There is a set of nerves which governs your heartbeat and it is considered to be like the brain of your heart.  But it has no mind--Imagine, smart emotions!  Your mind is a complex entity (primarily because of the nature of its existence) which exists as a consequence of the functioning of your brain.  It is the intricate electrical map of the neural pathways in your brain--it is not the pathways themselves, but rahter it is the electricity which travels along them.  But that's also a dangerous over-simplification.  The Mind is a powerful and strange entity, almost like a Mythical creature capable of magical powers.

It is the mind that interferes with that thinking.<br>  <br>  Just think of the mind as like a radio receiver and transmitter.  It's job is to receive and transmit thought - not to run your life for you.

Who is doing the thinking?  Is it the physical brain?  Is it the electrical impulses that skip over brain cells?  OR - is it something else which is quite extraordinary?

For each competition you win, add the award and picture to your portfolio. It'll also help reality sink in if you enter lots and lots of competitions but fail to ever win anything.<br>  <br>  You can also be a part of volunteer work, especially for organisations that don't have money but would like exposure for their cause somehow (eg. things like walkathons are great opportunities to capture emotions on people's faces).

Take some classes, join a club, get your product improved. Perhaps that is why you have not been noticed.

Once you have honed your craft, try getting your local library, cafe, bank, hospital or college to let you have a showing. It usually lasts a month and you have one opening party. Leave information on the sale of your product at the site. If you improve, you will get noticed.
NBy23FHXaa	1909 the titanic was started. 1911 it was finished<br>  The Lagan Boat Company Belfast, Ireland.<br>  Built by Harland and Wolff yards in Belfast, Ireland and launched from there. <br>  <br>  The Titanic was constructed by the shipbuilding firm of Harland and Wolff at their Queen's Island Works in Belfast, Ireland. Edward Harland acquired the yard in 1859. A few years later, G. W. Wolff was taken into the partnership and in 1862 the name changed to Harland and Wolff. By the time of the Titanic's construction, both these men had either died or gone into retirement, and the company placed under the management of Lord Pirrie.<br>  <br>  The Mersy Inquiry determined that there were 1,316 passsengers on board: 325 in first-class, 285 in second, and 706 in third-class. At the time of the sinking, the Ship's crew consisted of 885 men and women divided between three departments: Deck Department, 66; Engine Department, 325; Victualling (Passenger Care) Department, 494. Not included in this list are the eight members of the Ship's band who were technically from another company and traveled under second-class tickets.<br>  <br>  The keel for Titanic was laid in March 1909, and her hull was launched May, 1911.

That guy is very good at teaching and will help you get off on the right foot.  Good luck|`|OcVQLSNWaa	Firstly, you will need a guitar. Acoustic is how many guitar players often start off, and it is certainly the cheapest, but if you have the money, get an electric. You will also need to buy an amp and a lead if you go for the latter option, which adds to the cost. A tuner, a case and picks are also essential.<br>  Next, you will need lessons. I find that online lessons aren't as good as personal lessons. They are often general and they can't help you with specific problems. Also, real people can give you books and music sheets to help you along. <br>  Lastly, PRACTICE. I know it might seem a bit annoying, but its the only way to go. As you get better you will be able to learn harder songs, and pour more money into your hobbies with new guitars and accessories.<br>  It isn't very easy, but it is fun. Persistence and Practice as the keys.|`|vlC3i7eeaa	I agree with the links above, justinguitar.com. It's a great site and he is a good teacher. I use that along with lessons from a professional guitarist. I am lucky enough to know the guy, he went to Berklee here in Boston and he's very good at what he does. Combining what I learn from him (a good teacher) and what I watch online (at Justin's site) I feel I learn pretty much everything I need to and see progressions regularly. I've only been playing over a year but I see myself getting better every week.<br>  <br>  Also, I started out on electric and just recently bought an acoustic. I think it's easier to learn on electric, but man what a challenge it is switching to acoustic. The strings are harder, bend less, and you get a lot of buzz. It sure does build up finger strength though! Good luck!

NYU37jfGaa	The Depression really came after the twenties.  I thinkt he Depression is usually considered to have begun with the Wall Street Crash in 1929, and ended with America's entry into World War Two in 1941.<br>  <br>  The 1920s was an era when a lot of people were conspicuously enjoying themselves, but even in the 20s there would have been plenty of poor people who led quite hard lives, but their lives would have become a lot harder during the Depression.<br>  <br>  For black people the 20s was a hard time, with a lot of discrimination as regards jobs etc.  In America's Women' Gail Collins writes:<br>  <br>  'African American women of middle age or younger in the NOrth had approximately the same literacy rate as white women their age and were just as likely to send their children to school.  But the payoff was much lower for black students.  Even those with high school degrees were shut out of clerical and sales jobs in white neighborhoods.  Employers refused to hire black women, even though they w ere better educated and worked for less than the pool of available whites. (Addie Hunter, a graduate of an excellent high school in Boston, fought for years to find a white-collar job but wound up working in a factory "color - the reason nobody will give, the reason nobody is required to give, will always be in the way") she concluded.  Inevitably, most black women wound up in domestic service.   African Americans were abouit a fourth of the domestics in 1900 and half by 1930.'|`|AA12343309	The Great Depression followed the Roaring Twenties.  It might be said the Great Depression brought an end to the Roaring Twenties.<br>  <br>  The Roaring Twenties came after the end of WWI.  There was a feeling of celebration, all is well  and then the Great Depression happened and the rise or Nazism in Germany sort of burst the bubble.|`|xGDkGuIxaa	It depends who it is you're talking about.  The rich white people who wrote history would probably say it was great.  For minorities, I doubt it was.  It was a good time for jazz and art, but most great art is an expression of some kind of suffering. It was a time of inflated wealth for America and the trickle down theory was enacted with Calvin Coolidge as president, but it was false wealth and false appearances which all came crashing down later.  The pursuit of money and things might have even been detrimental to people's happiness. The Great Gatsby would probably be an insightful source for you to check out.

K4lRi1fjaa	g'day Nicegirl,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  Sir Isaac Newton was found to have massive amounts of mercury in his body due to his experiments in alchemy. He may well have had mercury poisoning later in his life.<br>  <br>  He also seems to have unorthodox religious views which he kept very well hid. As well, he had a great interest in ancient philosophy owning more humanistic texts than on science and mathematics.<br>  <br>  He was also Warden of the Royal Mint which he took very seriously being responsible for several prosecutions of counterfeiters.<br>  <br>  I have attached sources for your reference.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|Fnp2MIycaa	Sir Isaac Newton, famous for his revolutionary work in mathematics, optics, gravity and the laws of motion, had a secret hobby. A collection of his notes thought to have been lost 70 years ago reveal his passion for alchemy and fruitless attempts to turn lead into gold.<br>  <br>  His handwritten notes, commenting on the work of other famous 17th century alchemists and documenting his own attempts to manufacture precious metals, were rediscovered in the vaults of the Royal Society. <br>  <br>  Newton kept hidden his occasional interest in alchemy during his lifetime, in part because the making of gold or silver was a felony and had been since a law was passed by Henry IV in 1404. But throughout his career he, and other scientists of the time, many of whom were fellows of the society, carried out extensive research into alchemy.

Why???<br>  <br>  At the risk of spoiling anyone, all I can say is that it's more than just a twist; if you're really invested in Jace and Clary, you shouldn't give up on them yet -- there's still a lot to come in their future, a lot of surprises about their history, and plenty more developments in the Jace/Clary/Simon love triangle. <br>  ──────────────────────────────────────<br>  So maybe there's still hope for the two of them.<br>  <br>  But wait!

AJNAAAbPaa	It depends on what you think wealthy is. Yes he is pretty well off but he is no where near as wealthy as the others in the story, including Gatsby. Nick does have a place that is rather nice but he does not have any of the "old money" or the "new money" wich are frequently mentioned in the bbok. I believe Gatsby falls under "old money". So no compared to the others in the story Nick is not wealthy.|`|AA10516363	Well, he lives in a non-extravagant house and doesn't buy many things.

Like others in his generation, he is restless and has decided to move East to New York and learn the bond business. The novel opens early in the summer of 1922 in West Egg, Long Island, where Nick has rented a house. Next to his place is a huge mansion complete with Gothic towers and a large swimming pool which belongs to a Mr. Gatsby, whom Nick has not yet met. Directly across the bay from West Egg is the more fashionable community of East Egg where Tom and Daisy Buchanan live. Daisy is Nick′s cousin, and Tom had been in the same senior society as Nick in New Haven. <br>  <br>  Like Nick they are Midwesterners who have come East to be a part of the glamour of the New York City area. They invite Nick to dinner at their mansion and here he meets a young women golfer named Jordan Baker. During dinner Mrs. Myrtle Wilson rings. She lives in a strange place between West Egg and New York City that the narrator calls the “valley of ashes.” One day Tom takes Nick to meet the Wilsons but the party breaks up as Tom breaks Myrtles nose with a blow of his open hand because she has mentioned the name of his wife in a discussion. Some weeks later Nick finally gets the opportunity to meet his mysterious neighbour Mr. Gatsby. Gatsby gives huge parties and people come from everywhere to attend these parties, but no one seems to know much about the host. Nick becomes fascinated by Gatsby and observes that he does not drink. One day Nick and Gatsby drive to New York together. Gatsby tells Nick that he is from a wealthy family in the Midwest, that he was educated at Oxford, and that he won war medals from many European countries. At tea that afternoon Nick finds out from Jordan Baker why Gatsby has taken such an interest in him: Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchanan and wants Nick to arrange a meeting between them. Gatsby had fallen in love with Daisy as a young officer in 1917. He had been sent overseas, and she had eventually given him up and married Tom. So Gatsby decided to win Daisy back. His first step was to buy a house in West Egg. From here he could look across the bay to the green light at the end of Daisy′s dock.<br>  <br>  The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.<br>  <br>  The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age." Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.

NYU37jfGaa	Elizabeth Cady Stanton studied law with her father and her experience of his office led to a concern for the property and custody rights of women.  <br>  <br>  She became involved in the anti-slavery movement, and in the London anti-slavery convention in 1840 she met Lucretia Mott.  They were both annoyed because women were not allowed to speak at the convention, and this led to them discussing the possiblity of a convention for women's rights.<br>  <br>  It seems that it was her experience of her father's law firm that originally sparked her interest in women's rights, and her involvement with the anti-slavery movement increased her political awareness.
kfOpbbCyaa	Most people believe Jesus' birth was before the first century A.D. According to this site <a href="http://www.doig.net/NTCII.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.doig.net/NTCII.htm</a> the conception of Jesus would have been somewhere around 5 B.C. (BCE), thus the Gospel of Luke would start around that time. Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Jesus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_...</a> puts Jesus' birth at around 6 BC.<br>  <br>  That initial site <a href="http://www.doig.net/NTC24.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.doig.net/NTC24.htm</a> puts the crucifixion at 30 AD (CE). (Since Jesus was 33 at the time of the crucifixion, you can figure out the relative dates from birth to crucifixion.) Luke's Gospel ends with the resurrection, so he covers a period of a bit more than 33 years. (By the way, that site has some interesting information and is a study in itself.)<br>  <br>  Luke covers, then, the end of BC (BCE) and the beginning years of AD (CE), or just before Jesus was born to the resurrection.<br>  <br>  The Gospel of Luke is written as a history. <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/newtestamentbooks/qt/gospellukeintro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianity.about.com/od/newtest...</a> According to this site <a href="http://www.harvardhouse.com/Luke_date-written.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.harvardhouse.com/Luke_date-wr...</a> this Gospel was written around 60 AD (CE) though this site <a href="http://sol.sci.uop.edu/~jfalward/Luke.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sol.sci.uop.edu/~jfalward/Luke.ht...</a> considers the date it was written as later than that. There are varying ideas about when this Gospel was written, but the dates it covers are those surrounding Jesus' life. <a href="http://www.carm.org/apologetics/evidence-and-answers/when-were-gospels-written-and-whom" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/apologetics/evidence...</a><br>  <br>  This site <a href="http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1116&C=1230" rel="nofollow">http://www.religion-online.org/showchapt...</a> also explains why Luke is considered to be written as a history.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, though it really just gives a beginning of study since there is so much information to read and research.|`|83ftA09Paa	It covers the first 30 years of the first century CE.<br>  <br>  It is mostly a book of fiction like all the Gospels.<br>  .

I am going to say something that I don’t think has ever been said before. And that is that I think sick, ugly minded, stinking, dead drunk, vermin-ridden neo Nazis should be largely laughed at, ignored, avoided and never imitated. There are so many of these foul-breathed little egotists who kill themselves with drugs and booze and the worse part is that the whole experience is made to sound like the very epitome of grunge chic. I met a heroin addict who was like that. All the stories of going cold turkey, sleeping on the street, contracting a multitude of different hepatitis strains were on a continual play list. When I finally got fed up with it, I told him he was romanticizing his disease, and it was boring. I said that if I was incontinent or had a very small penis, I would not be regaling everyone everywhere on the details of my pants-wetting, the type of diapers I was wearing, or the prosthetic devises I was using to get laid. I would shut up about it. His response was to spit full in my face and storm off. <br>  <br>  One of my English Professors at University was a Welsh drunk who was also a mediocre but published poet. He would feel it necessary to out drink his students and make embarrassing attempts to seduce young females. He would vomit and lie on the floor at official functions. He died, as he know doubt knew EVERY legitimate poet did, young, and having broken a lot of hearts and damaged a lot of lives. Nevertheless, about 1000 students who fancied themselves as potential poets thought that it was necessary to get alcoholic poisoning, do drugs, get lonely women pregnant and then leave them, rage on and on about how great they are, have a permanent chip of their shoulder, and like their Welsh mentor, become sick, old and diseased (for the sake of their art). So I reckon this meagerly talented, selfish ego maniac led hundreds of young, healthy and na?ve students to ruin their lives and the lives of those who loved them by propounding the notion that to be an artist you just HAD to be junkie, a sexual pervert, a drunk, a sexual addict, and a liar and cheat to finish off. This is very much the notion at present, and the idea that someone could be a talented, imaginative, creative, sensitive and committed artist who is healthy, sober, clean living and pays his bills is about as likely as the Pope being a Muslim. <br>  <br>  This strange concept may its origins in Byron, who was also a major spoilt brat and sexual predator who died the death of a histrionic clown in Greece. Later, writers like Jack Kerouac reinforced the idea that being a junkie is much much cooler than for example getting stuck into cough medicine. Then we had generations of poseurs and fakes throwing buckets of paint over paper and dragging nudes over them etc etc etc, and with all of them they had to be depressives, drunk, beat people up, get beaten up, take up hospital time, and then denounce them, and so on. <br>  <br>  Frankly, my parents were poor. My father brought up a family of 6 on a wage of a roadworker, and we never called on a charity once or wore a pair of second hand shoes. There were entire generations of people who were “down and out” and even unemployed, and some were close to starving, but they behaved like civilized human beings, never forget their responsibilities, and didn’t act like shameful lechers, thieves and miscreants, and then write books boasting about it.  Everyone who deals with these desperates eventually gets a knife in the back, so my advice is just laugh at them and avoid them. Think of wankers like Mick Jagger who was the epitome of drug use and “street fighting” was in private smart enough to remain healthy and avoid “street fighting”. As a result, he is  geriatric strutting on a stage yelling about ploughing through teenage girls (presumably on Viagra) and munching on bean sprouts, while whole cemeteries are filled with the bodies of those who took his and those of his ilk seriously.|`|THonpuVGaa	I know of him only because of our Buk...I did a year or so ago check out his poetry...my only comment - he had a unique mind.<br>  <br>  Here he shows you can write a poem about anything -<br>  <br>  16-bit Intel 8088 chip<br>     <br>    with an Apple Macintosh<br>  you can't run Radio Shack programs<br>  in its disc drive.<br>  nor can a Commodore 64<br>  drive read a file<br>  you have created on an<br>  IBM Personal Computer.<br>  both Kaypro and Osborne computers use<br>  the CP/M operating system<br>  but can't read each other's<br>  handwriting<br>  for they format (write<br>  on) discs in different<br>  ways.<br>  the Tandy 2000 runs MS-DOS but<br>  can't use most programs produced for<br>  the IBM Personal Computer<br>  unless certain<br>  bits and bytes are<br>  altered<br>  but the wind still blows over<br>  Savannah<br>  and in the Spring<br>  the turkey buzzard struts and<br>  flounces before his<br>  hens. <br>  <br>  ..............I like it.|`|8c8ca69ba60952337e6a67121fe756c9aa	Bukowski is one of the most honest poets/writers (his stories and novels are good reads too--find the novel Ham on Rye, you will not be disappointed) I have ever come across.

Summarising: Iberian, Celtic, Carthaginian, Graeco-Roman, Goth, Moor/Arab.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	In antiquity, the lands around Sevilla belonged to an Iberian tribe (Spain and Portugal form the Iberian peninsula) called the Turdetani. However it was also contested by the Conii and Turduli tribes. <br>  <br>  Later, as the mercantile empire of Carthage grew, the area fell within the Carthaginian sphere of influence. <br>  <br>  Following the Second Punic War, the land was turned to Roman rule. <br>  <br>  During the Barbarian Invasions of Rome, the Iberian peninsula was conquered by first the Vandals on their way to North Africa, then the Visigoths. <br>  <br>  With the rise and expansion of the Islamic empires in Arabia and North Africa, the Moors expanded into the region. <br>  <br>  It was recovered by the King of Castille and Leon in the Reconquista and remained in Spanish hands.

The part that leaves me confused is how the poem turns from the loss of a hero (either by death or mistake), to how "you've" fallen.  The image you created to express the loss of a hero was spot on! "when your hero falls so do the flickering stars", fantastic line.  The rest of the poem is an apology of sorts, a plea for forgiveness.  If you were setting yourself up as the fallen hero, it might come off a little pretentious...so again, I'm not quite sure why the poem took a different turn, but it started out wonderfully.<br>  <br>  keep writing

Without the laws we would, as humans run amok.|`|AA10729271	I think that it is one of those questions that is hard to answer because you'll never know how you'll react in a such a situation until you're in one. <br>  <br>  That being said, i think our survival instincts take over at a certain point, so in your example with the intruder, your protective instincts might kick in, and lets say if you had a firearm you could retaliate. and while they could charge you for assault or manslaughter, there are reasons why self defence is a plea that you can use and hopefully you would be exonerated, so laws do take into account that there are times when breaking the law can be forgiven if the reasons for it are not premeditated and done in the heat of the moment.|`|YxiqI903aa	Laws were made to increase survival, according to their background knowledge.<br>  <br>  Logically, you would decrease your survival if you chose to defy the laws.<br>  <br>  For example: Laws of Gravity<br>  <br>  Gravity pulls an object down at 9.8 Meters per second. If you were 10 stories high and decided to try to defy that law, you would have a 0% chance of survival.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting to talk about marijuana or alcohol that is different. You can even die from drinking too much water.<br>  <br>  As the saying goes, "Everything in moderation."<br>  <br>  If you fall from a moderate height, you'll survive, though you may never walk again.<br>  <br>  Man made laws change all the time. Marijuana is illegal, but some need it to survive and have a better life span, though the law prohibit the use, except for medicinal use. So, man made laws can always change.<br>  <br>  You break a man made law, and you go to jail and survival rate is real small there.|`|VM9Vsf9naa	Not sure if I can ever answer all your questions but there are a couple of instances going back a few years in memory where laws hindered the survival of humans. One was a case of a capsized boat in our locality more or less a few miles away, and the locals wanted to rescue those in the upturned boat but hadn't the equipment for underwater rescue. It was required that such accidents in the water by law required the Govt emergency team to deal with it. Of course they took hours to arrive with their diving equipment and by then it was far too late. Five people perished because of that delay based on marine laws.<br>  <br>  By the way, I think you are supposed to ask only one question, not a half dozen!

d1r54kz9aa	Well Abraham Lincoln was quite the shady character, although not much about his "bad" side is known.  In order to preserve the union, he realized the the border states must be preserved at all costs.  Thus, he initiated many laws in the border states such as suspending habeus corpus and suspending much of the freedoms in the bill of rights.  If you want to read up more on this type "border states and Lincoln" into google.<br>  <br>  Also, Lincoln tried not to attack the confederates first....<br>  <br>  His actions were both unconstitutional and illegal according to constitutional law.

She spent almost all her money to bribe a steward to get a spot on the train which was so full people were hanging off the sides and climbing on the roof. Then, according to her, a voice whispered in her ear "Get off now" so she did, leaving all of her possessions on the train, basically the train took off, leaving her standing on the platform, penniless with just the clothes on her back. <br>  <br>  About 20 minutes later, at about the time her train would have arrived in Dresden the allies firebombed the city (train station area was toast).

w7USF5wDaa	In German "leiden" means suffering and "stadt" means city so I suppose Goldman might have been trying to make the point that the German people suffered after WW1 and if he was in that position would he have gone along with the Nazis later on.  The song is basically about how if he were to find himself in one of those situations (being a German growing up between the wars, being a dockworker in Belfast, being a white man in Johannesburg) could he really say how his life would have turned out, what decisions he would have made.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

4vbovQKJaa	Your writing isn't bad but you desperately need to edit.  You have misspellings, punctuation mistakes, capitalization problems, and grammatical errors all over the place.  <br>  <br>  As for the story line itself, your excerpt is really too short to even know what genre you're aiming for.  I can't really comment on the plot at all.<br>  <br>  Your dialogue in the last paragraph is not believable.  Try something like "What the hell just hit me?"  Or just "What the hell?".  What you have now is cumbersome.<br>  <br>  All in all, you do seem to be on the right track.  The story picks up nicely right from the beginning - you've done a nice job of giving some background information without dumping too much on your reader.  Just make sure you edit, edit, edit.  Good luck!

79YQAbSRaa	I read Koontz years ago, beginning with Watchers.  I loved that one, and quickly devoured the others that were out at the time.  After awhile, the characters all felt the same to me.   I enjoyed the action and the pace of his books.  Haven't read the Odd books, but they're on my list, so I'm not sure it's even fair for me to compare the two authors.<br>  <br>  I've always preferred King.  His books seem to stay with me a lot longer.  The stories dig a little deeper or something.  And I love the way King puts the little parenthetical thoughts of his characters in the middle of action sequences or dialogue.  There's a difference between 3 different periods in his writing, the Castle Rock Books, the Eclipse Books and The Post Accident books.  I love them all, but I prefer the Post Accident novels.  I finished Duma Key over a year ago and it still pops back in my mind frequently...those are the kind of books I love the most, the ones that won't let you forget them. <br>  <br>  Another author like these two that I enjoy but who isn't nearly as prolific is Robert McCammon.  Swan Song was one of the few books that I had to put down because it was so disturbing (for a few weeks and then finished it).  Stinger, Usher's Passing, Mine, The Wolf's Hour...I really enjoyed them and others but I can't remember the titles off the top of my head.<br>  <br>  King remains the only author whose books I buy simply because they have his name on them.  I don't have to know anything else about the book except that he wrote it to know that I'll enjoy it.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Stephen King, for certain. His characters are brought to life like no other author has ever been able to do. When I read a book of his, I feel like I truly know these characters. I also love the way his books intersect with characters and places; this adds to the whole "brought to life" thing I mentioned before. I know it's a good book when I'm stalling the last pages because I don't want to lose these characters and this story I've gotten so attached to. <br>  <br>  I do like Dean Koontz as well...but not all of his stuff. I liked his older works (especially Whispers, one of my all time favorites), and some of his newer (The Moonlight Bay Trilogy, for example and I *love* the Odd Thomas books), but there were some in the in-between that almost seemed like someone else was writing them, and I didn't care for those. <br>  <br>  I also like Peter Straub (have you read lost boy/lost girl? *excellent* book), John Sandford (the Prey series, crime not horror, but some crime is horror, no?), John Saul.|`|qQtupqe2aa	i like edgar allen poe! thrilling. <br>  being fair i would have to give this one though to king because i have yet to fully read a koontz book. i have though read two books by king. the stand and the girl who loved tom gordon. i liked the second one a lot and i owen in in a pop up book form. it did how ever due to multiple moves and other obstacles take me 6 tries at the stand to finish it. and i need a new copy of that one. you should try reading a suspenseful romance. or, and i know its not an "adult" series but check out the curique du freak series by darren shawn. i like them a lot.|`|Rm1zxWQmaa	I would agree with you, Dean Koontz is a little better over all. But one book from Stephen King that is my all time favourite is Lisey's Story. It gets over looked because it isn't one of the classic King books like The Stand or It. Lisey's Story was released in the last few years. If you haven't read it, check it out.|`|YMXdE0Vzaa	King all the way.<br>  I like the descripive scenes King develops.<br>  He takes his time.|`|9RTuRPviaa	I prefer Stephen King. I like how much depth he gives to his characters. I like reading dialogue that he writes because of the way he works in dialect (hope that made sense, i'm getting tired). <br>  I actually enjoy how he builds up a story. I like how he doesn't give you every single detail, he gives you room to fill in some things for yourself and sometimes that makes the story a bit scarier.<br>  I hope you understand, i don't dislike Dean Koontz, he is a very good writer, i just never really got into him :)<br>  <br>  Lol, "Not one thing about Twilight please", that was good.|`|QlB3VXWraa	I like both.<br>  <br>  Koontz is more consistent but more cookie cutter, formula - lots of recycled, recurring themes in his books.<br>  <br>  King is overall a better writer, more imaginative, more original, with a broader range but he is capable of an occasional turkey.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	Scott Sigler (His books are available in audio free on his website) It might be the great amounts of  violence that are important to the story and gallows humor.  <br>  I like Koontz Brother Odd books and I liked the books of Kings I have consumed.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	in the old days, King could have out written Koontz in any kind of writing. but King has slowed alot. <br>  Koontz is now my favorite. he rocks.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Dean Koontz by far.Stephen King's books are all the same these days.He used to be good,but something happened.I don't think he really cares what he writes about,he just wants the money.|`|RQfLKOPQaa	Right now-> Dean Koontz. I think he has some really cool books, the Odd Thomas series is great, although these last few books have been a little too spiritual to my tastes- probably because his dog died recently and He's still feeling it. In fact, anyone who knows Koontz, knows he is a dog lover, not many thriller writers have that many books where dogs have such a central role. The old King was also cool: The Stand, It, Dark Half, are all great books, the newer stuff- not so much. It's not that he became a bad writer all of a sudden, it's just that his ideas are not working for me right now.<br>  <br>  I would advise to take a look at the late Richard Laymon, it was a sad day for horror fans when he died. His books are mostly slasher books, but there are a few gems out there, and it's definitely horror, with a touch of gore- all very explicit. Regardless, the pace of his books are great, it's all story, so if you like Koontz, you'll like Laymon in terms of pace. In terms of subject, it's another story. I would recommend Island, The beast house trilogy, Savage, One rainy night, Flesh, Bite, The stake , and a lot more. I have them all, but I also have all of Koontzs, and all of Kings, so my book shelf in the K and L section is filled with horror stories, Close to a hundred books for just these 3 authors.

Stories can come from many sources at any time. Here are some ways you can start brainstorming your ideas.<br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Open mind <br>  Observation and detailed thoughts <br>  Pen and paper <br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Start with yourself and your surroundings. Think about your emotions,the people you know, your neighborhood, pets and things you do everyday. <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Be observant. Take a look around you. Notice people in different settings.<br>  *Look at nature. In each scene, look for interactions, energy and emotions. <br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Find inspiration through other sources. Read books or magazines. Watch movies. Listen to radio. <br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Using Steps 1 through 3--Everything mentioned above can become an idea for a short story. Visualize what you observe or listen to and let your imagination run free even if it's weird or seems stupid. Try to come up with a story line or even a simple scene and build from that point. Or let's say for example that you listen to a song that stirs an emotion in you. Build on the emotion, visualize a scene using the emotion and build your story. <br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Write it down. List your ideas, write down the scene, characters, settings, beginnings or endings. <br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Always think about it. Keep adding ideas while going about your day. Maybe you see or hear something that you think would work in your story, write down and build on it. <br>  <br>  Your example is a good idea. You could start with it, using these suggested steps. Good luck to you and God bless.

The sultan Shahryar, disillusioned by the sexual infidelity of women, has decided to marry a new wife every night only to kill her the next morning. Three years later, all marriageable women have either been killed or deserted the town, and none are left except the vizier's own daughters Scheherazade and Dinarzade. Scheherazade, the elder one, is well educated and has read a thousand books of histories and tales. Against her father's advice she insists on challenging the king. After the consummation of their marriage, Scheherazade has her sister ask her to tell a tale in order to pass the time. Scheherazade narrates a fascinating tale, but breaks off without reaching the end. Out of curiosity the king decides not to kill her and listens to the continuation next night. This strategy of suspense goes on for a thousand nights, until Scheherazade in the thousand and first night discloses her ruse and presents to the king the three children to whom she meanwhile has given birth.

I think it best that I name a few that I most admire and maybe you will agree.<br>  <br>  Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst (and their helpers).<br>  The Pankhurst's were instrumental in the suffrage movement in the earlier part of the twentieth century and their efforts are one of the main reasons that women across the UK have the right to vote today. Their legacy lives on inside all women, consciously or without even knowing, but they should be thanked by every woman in Britain today.<br>  <br>  Sophie Scholl<br>  Sophie was a young German women studying at university when Hitler came into power. Most people have not heard of her struggle but it is something that I urge people to investigate. Whilst I will not go into great detail now, I want to make clear that whilst her efforts against Hitler's Germany were small and did not create any impacts, her legacy is one of bravery and courage which should be admired by all as she made the ultimate sacrifice (death) for her cause.

Stories aren't all about plot; a well drawn character can get you just as many points.<br>  Start with a basic characteristic like greedy,  stupid,  bullying, shy, gay,  fashion-conscious,  selfish,  humorous,  nervous,  etc..  Then add another characteristic that's the opposite of the first :  maybe a bully who's also a coward,  a fashion victim who's also a slob,  or a nervous person who's also cruel when he gets the chance.  Give him a tag:  either a visual tag like a beard,  glasses, cold eyes etc.,  or a vocal tag like an accent, a repeated endearment like "poppet", a lot of slang,  or swearing.  Refer frequently to the visual tag to remind your reader (so he can picture your character)  and use an example of the vocal tag every time he speaks.  Make him act always in character and he'll come alive,  whatever the story.   If you're stuck try picturing a strong character actor as you write,  at least some flavour of the original is bound to come through.   That way you can do much of the work before you even see the exam paper.<br>  Good luck.|`|Oyvlt2vyaa	The Fugitive - try something like a person who's on the run, maybe a totalitarian state and the character has done something wrong, like not had a baby to repopulate the world or had a baby out of wedlock in an extremely overpopulated world.  Dystopia works well, I guess.  Maybe if your character is innocent of the charges too.<br>  <br>  Unforgettable Moment - zombies!  :P Maybe not a good idea, ignore this suggestion.  Like, the moment you saw your friend die.  Hm, that could be quite good, if you make it really emotive. <br>  <br>  The Journey of a Life Time -  character is dead, and travelling on to the after life?<br>  <br>  The Gift - an extra sense of some sort the character is just getting, and is it good or evil?  <br>  <br>  A Night Out - going clubbing, and getting kidnapped.

AA10729271	For sure, I recoomend a novel called Parellelities by Alan Dean Foster, about a reporter who goes to interview a scientist who has invented a machine that lets you see into alternate universises. something goes wrong: (quote from wikipedia follows)<br>  <br>  Max is sent to interview a rich man, Barrington Boles, who claims to have invented a machine that can break through the barrier between parallel worlds, or "paras." Max first assumes the man is a typical loonie, but after returning home, he finds his apartment burglarized by identical triplets who don't seem to know one another. Later, he flirts with four "sisters" who look almost but not quite identical, and who claim never to have met before the previous night. Mystified, he rushes back to Boles's place to ask the inventor what on earth is going on. Boles informs him that the machine must have turned Max into a sort of magnet that pulls the inhabitants of other worlds into his own. Max is frantic, but Boles reassures him that the effect will probably wear off in a few days, and that if it doesn't, he should come back on Tuesday.<br>  <br>  Max tries to resume his life, but his neighbor's canary turns into a hundred identical birds, and the next day Max runs into a double of himself at work. The double (whom he calls "Mitch" to avoid confusion) has no idea what's going on, apparently coming from a para where Max never interviewed Boles. After Max explains the situation to him, they decide to pose as twins. They go to a zoo to work on a story about a painting elephant, only to find the zoo overrun by fifty female chimps.<br>  <br>  Sensing that the situation has gotten out of hand, Max and Mitch decide to visit Boles again. But on the way, they spot a herd of Bighorn Sheep and a condor, species extinct in Los Angeles. Max realizes that he's no longer simply pulling things from other worlds into his own, but drifting into other worlds (apparently taking Mitch with him). When they arrive at Boles's mansion, this version of Boles doesn't remember their second meeting and has no idea how to help them|`|a7pCUHoiaa	I think it's impossible to answer philosophical questions 'correctly' because - although there are a limited number of words in the english language - there's an infinite number of beliefs/opinions (I believe) that I could share with you.<br>  <br>  Here's the answer that first comes to my mind when I ask myself your question:<br>  <br>  Q: Do parallel universes blow your mind?<br>  <br>  A: No, they do not blow my mind, but self-analytically/psychologically speaking, I'm programmed to (through my "false ego") say "no it wouldn't blow my mind or suprise me one bit", so that's really the only answer I can give without challenging my instinctive belief system.<br>  <br>  Much like peer presure to say 'oh well energy drinks are cool but they aren't as good as vodka and coke!'. Unfortunately a very prevailiant social norm/status quo among the 'baby boomer' and 'x' generations. I believe the effect of this social demand is 'jadedness/boredom/disinterest' and is usually refered to as 'overstimulation'. This is off topic but does have to do with the choices we make. I think a social change would do a lot more 'good' than imagining the choice we made in another universe...<br>  <br>  Q: Wouldn't it be amazing if you had a window to your other versions?<br>  <br>  A: I'm assuming by 'window' you mean the ability to see beyond the 100 billion or so light years of distance between our Earth and the Earth next to us, and every single one of the 'infinite universes/selves'. <br>  By 'seeing' I'm assuming you mean the ability to connect/understand the decisions made by the alternate 'me' and to see the effect they had on 'my' life. The implication(s) of this suggestion is/are insane (slang term ;P), and I would value this information above all else. If this theory were true, it would most likely be information collected and used by 'God' to make decisions either for God's self or God's future creation of myself as a perfect creature [or a combination of me + everybody else manifested as one being, most likely God's mate?]. <br>  It would be similar to the concept of having the power to see into the future and basing decisions off of that. It would also show me the best possible options and therefore enable me to live an 'ideal' life.<br>  <br>  My Q for you: What is your motivation/intention for asking this?|`|RvmYqQtRaa	You know what blows my mind the fact that that's not even accurate because with every variation you'd get so much variety that in 99.9% of the realities you wouldn't even exist or you wouldn't even be you because some other sperm beat you out for your spot.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	i wish i could switch places with the me that doesnt have to work or worry about bills or anything. if i am out there in another universe living it up on a sunny beach with blue sand and a white sky then i wish that me would throw the me that is here a fricking bone|`|aBWV0Pyraa	That'd be an Amazing Window!<br>  <br>  (Opportunity Knocks).<br>  :))<br>  <br>  Edit: Scott F:  Maybe Sperm don't exist in 99.9% of the other realities...(how do we Know)??|`|U2wkJRrMaa	Hmm, no.<br>  <br>  But I don't want to see another me.

bRuCUSfpaa	Well I am reading the book now so I will tell you<br>  so The little prince has a rose and basically he gets fed up with her and leaves on an adventure to find himself and find the answers of life. From the fox he learns that the rose tamed him and he tamed her and they belong together :)|`|1NWjta2jaa	The narrator, an airplane pilot, crashes in the Sahara desert. The crash badly damages his airplane and leaves the narrator with very little food or water. As he is worrying over his predicament, he is approached by the little prince, a very serious little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator obliges, and the two become friends. The pilot learns that the little prince comes from a small planet that the little prince calls Asteroid 325 but that people on Earth call Asteroid B-612. The little prince took great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees. One day, a mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell in love with it. But when he caught the rose in a lie one day, he decided that he could not trust her anymore. He grew lonely and decided to leave. Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the rose, the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his loneliness.<br>   <br>  While journeying, the narrator tells us, the little prince passes by neighboring asteroids and encounters for the first time the strange, narrow-minded world of grown-ups. On the first six planets the little prince visits, he meets a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer, all of whom live alone and are overly consumed by their chosen occupations. Such strange behavior both amuses and perturbs the little prince. He does not understand their need to order people around, to be admired, and to own everything. With the exception of the lamplighter, whose dogged faithfulness he admires, the little prince does not think much of the adults he visits, and he does not learn anything useful. However, he learns from the geographer that flowers do not last forever, and he begins to miss the rose he has left behind.<br>   <br>  At the geographer's suggestion, the little prince visits Earth, but he lands in the middle of the desert and cannot find any humans. Instead, he meets a snake who speaks in riddles and hints darkly that its lethal poison can send the little prince back to the heavens if he so wishes. The little prince ignores the offer and continues his explorations, stopping to talk to a three-petaled flower and to climb the tallest mountain he can find, where he confuses the echo of his voice for conversation. Eventually, the little prince finds a rose garden, which surprises and depresses him—his rose had told him that she was the only one of her kind.<br>   <br>  The prince befriends a fox, who teaches him that the important things in life are visible only to the heart, that his time away from the rose makes the rose more special to him, and that love makes a person responsible for the beings that one loves. The little prince realizes that, even though there are many roses, his love for his rose makes her unique and that he is therefore responsible for her. Despite this revelation, he still feels very lonely because he is so far away from his rose. The prince ends his story by describing his encounters with two men, a railway switchman and a salesclerk.<br>   <br>  It is now the narrator's eighth day in the desert, and at the prince's suggestion, they set off to find a well. The water feeds their hearts as much as their bodies, and the two share a moment of bliss as they agree that too many people do not see what is truly important in life. The little prince's mind, however, is fixed on returning to his rose, and he begins making plans with the snake to head back to his planet. The narrator is able to fix his plane on the day before the one-year anniversary of the prince's arrival on Earth, and he walks sadly with his friend out to the place the prince landed. The snake bites the prince, who falls noiselessly to the sand.<br>   <br>  The narrator takes comfort when he cannot find the prince's body the next day and is confident that the prince has returned to his asteroid. The narrator is also comforted by the stars, in which he now hears the tinkling of his friend's laughter. Often, however, he grows sad and wonders if the sheep he drew has eaten the prince's rose. The narrator concludes by showing his readers a drawing of the desert landscape and by asking us to stop for a while under the stars if we are ever in the area and to let the narrator know immediately if the little prince has returned.|`|yvyewZrWaa	Yes, the rose lied to him, which caused him to doubt her love for him. He was made so lonely by this event that he left.
Gf8GzwADaa	the stuff we make nowadays is not really made to last, is it? our technology is extremely vulnerable in the face of natural catastrophes. unless we send capsules of our 'progress' into some safe zone (don't ask me about the practicalities of that plan) on another world, i cannot see how we can safeguard our acquired knowledge. if we survive as a species, the potential for advancement will be there, written in our genes, but it's otherwise back to square one. i do not think that forces beyond our control are depressing. they represent a challenge.<br>  <br>  i'll tell you what i do think is depressing: the amount of waste we inflict on our planet will probably outlast us all!|`|T9OLDgngaa	I don't think it matters because these things are not under our control.  It's  far better to get on with life and make a difference now.  Forget about the future.  You won't be around then anyway so why worry about it.

tEEw4CeWaa	It flourished in ancient Greece between c. 550 and c. 220 BCE.<br>  Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Thespis (the earliest known playwright) probably aided in the final transition from dithyramb to tragedy by adding characters who speak (rather than sing) with their own voice.<br>  <br>  Tragedy (late 6th century BCE), comedy (486 BCE), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there.  <br>  <br>  Actors wear masks and costumes that is why an actor can do two or more characters within a play.

You will, either, fail to make a believable connection, or pick an entirely inappropriate symbol.<br>  <br>  And asking US to make that connection for you makes even less sense.  WE don't know you so how can WE explain why a swallow is supposed to represent you?|`|b3783773e6afd95ad1913ece4e9fff9daa	The migratory habits of the European species have led to an association with spring, as recorded in the proverb "one swallow does not make a summer". They have also been incorporated into religious stories, in part because of their arrival in Europe around the time of Easter, and apocryphal stories place them at the crucifixion of Jesus, either trying to distract those sent to arrest Jesus in the garden or comfort Jesus on the cross. They are also mentioned in the Quran attacking Abraha, the pagan king of Yemen who was attacking Mecca. The tiny birds hurled small stones and forced Abraha's mighty army to retreat. The significance of the small birds is that God can order the smallest of his creations and miracles can happen. Older legends have it that Athene turned into one in order to flee danger.|`|yjyBbVJoaa	Do you know Oscar Wildes story "The happy prince". Most probably it is online and you will see the Swallow represents the selflessness and pain of love. It really is worth a read.
sKPIF3Emaa	To me, Ian looks like this: He is tall (somewhere from 6'2-6'4), with tousled light-medium brown hair. He has blue eyes, that are round. He has a kind-looking face, to match his personality. <br>  <br>  Then, he is lean-ish. I mean, there are some serious muscles going on, but nothing too macho (if you get what I mean). He is strong yet gentle at the same time. <br>  <br>  He is nowhere's near fat, (because I know what you're saying even if you mask the word "fat" with "chubby"), clean shaven, with the exception of some stubble when he's busy. I mean, Wanda always felt small, compared to other people, with her being a soul, and what not...<br>  <br>  I believe that Ian is like somewhere between 23-25. Somewhere there. And yes, heavy for them equals height and muscles. Kyle, though, is bigger. Some serious macho-ness going on there. To me, I see a crew cut, and a guy who always wears sleeveless shirts and shorts. <br>  <br>  Ian would fall in love with Wanda because she's so nice, and brave, and selfless. He even gets a little mad, because she's so selfless. He wants her to have some sense of self-preservation. <br>  <br>  (Just to let you know, you killed my view on Ian with that whole fat-with-a-beard thing... GROSS! I hope you're happy... )<br>  <br>  And, I refuse to pronounce his last name "OH SHAY" I will forever call it "OH SHEE UH"|`|3BQkXF5Xaa	Ive always seen him with dark brown to black hair with fair skin and sapphire blue eyes plus a kind face to go with the personality.

za9b8cHKaa	And what use do you suppose sarcasm has in modern literature? Sarcasm ... sarcasm? When has an author ever had any practical use for sarcasm?<br>  <br>  Quite often, actually. Sarcasm can be quite a useful literary tool. So too is irony. Sarcasm, when applied properly is witty, entertaining and can make a much stronger argument than simply stating facts. Shakespeare and Dickens often used sarcasm in their works.|`|pbw7chpyaa	Most people don't grasp that nobody knows they're being sarcastic on the net, because only the most overt usage comes across as sarcastic.  Most of the normal cues for sarcasm are not written.   In general "I was being sarcastic" just translates as "I was being mean", unless you know the person well.|`|7XJPyENFaa	I prefer straight truth on Y!A 'cause sarcasm in theses cases is often horribly misinterpreted.  I got into a Y!A message war with this guy once and said typed something sarcastic.  Of course he didn't know, so he flew off the handle and was rather a creep.  I didn't answer him anymore after that.  Thankfully, that particular account of mine is gone.<br>  <br>  I do think it's a useful literary tool.  Mark Twain did some great stuff with sarcasm in his books.<br>  <br>  <br>  But particularly strange, and might I say stupid, questions deserve sarcasm.  Besides, it's fun to use. :)|`|D8sN8gNFaa	When it's used right, and in moderation, it is both fun, and funny. When it's overused, or used in the wrong situation,it's just pointless.|`|FU4TyghIaa	Hey paradise.<br>  Sarcasm as a literary tool?  <br>  So you're saying you want to answer questions on here with sarcasm?  Yeah, i think that's an okay thing and some questions almost beg for it.  The Q and A dialog is very akin to speech, so it's not literature and it's not a literary tool.  <br>  Don't think i've read books that are thick with it.  Sure, dialog passages in a book might say "he smirked with vinegar sarcasm" or something like that, but not the body of the text.  To that ends, then it's not really a literary tool in the strict sense to my mind, it would be heavy going to read i suppose, but in the QA here, it's as i say, like dialogue anyway, and like some questions are just so, well sometimes people get it a little skewed i reckon.<br>  Straight truth or sarcasm on YA?  Depends on the context and yeah, if you feel that way inclined, let it rip.  Careful not to offer bad advice that could be interpreted literally and cause injury or have real how you say consequences.  You don't wanna get the blame for some guy sticking his doodle in the blender, just cause you said it tongue in cheek.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|f5918bf848d782397c0192726e310379aa	its great in real life, im very sarcastic<br>  <br>  on Y! answers and other literary resources however, it can be easily misinterpretted and therefore i feel unnecessary.|`|66Fhsm0vaa	i like sarcasm, but only if its obvious that you're being sarcastic. and only when its not overdone|`|VfbsGjYSaa	+It's terrible!+|`|F9AaLczyaa	sarcasm is awsome, don't dis it!!!haha|`|niGAKJT4aa	oh, sarcasm's GREAT!

KHSOVxViaa	As far as I know regular state education was never free, though it's possible that various mission and charity schools were.  There were scholarships available that would pay costs.<br>  <br>  The big difference in education was not the pupil/family payment, it was the amount of state funding for public schools, where white schools received much more money per pupil.  Of course, private schools still could charge significant fees, but they tended to be the preserve of the wealthy.

If you happen to live in CA, in-state tuition is pretty decent.<br>  <br>  A lot depends on what your specific interests in architecture.  Schools like Cal Poly and other technical institutes may be more engineering focuses, whereas art schools with programs in architecture will focus more on concept, design and theory.  An ideal program will give you a bit of both, since few of us know exactly where we'll end up when we first dive in.<br>  <br>  Also, if you haven't already, I'd HIGHLY recommend interning in an architect's office.

w0rXQ4Dgaa	I have a theory : It's the way that Bella describes him. She calls him luminous, flawless, angelic and gorgeous. And, these books are especially popular with pre-teen girls and teenagers. We're all learning about relationships and this book makes us think that we can find our very own Edward. Loving and beautiful...it can happen to you. But of course, it's practically impossible to find our very own Edward. There will be very nice guys, but none as perfect as Edward. The dynamics of relationships in this book are purely fictional, and there won't be guys as Edward. He is indestructable, immortal, and about 100 years old, posing as a seventeen year old. Now do you see why they love him so much?|`|sRw9oiQdaa	He is supposed to be gorgeous (as described)<br>  He is the 'bad boy' - vampire<br>  He represents the perfect boy with the fatal flaw.

Apparently, this is going to mess them up for life, as far as finding a relationship that meets standards that high.<br>  <br>  Because Steph Meyer is an idiot and thinks there is such thing as a perfect guy, when there obviously is not such thing as perfection.

vgPH9Engaa	Financially, not likely. Mentally, yes.<br>  As pointed out by several others, it is difficult--near impossible--to make a living strictly off of the work you publish.<br>  Think of it like this: small literary magazines (titles you've never heard of and wouldn't think to read) reject most work sent to them. If they receive just 2500 submissions of short stories and/or poems, and only accept 50, they rejected 98% of what was sent to them. All that for a small time press. Look at a larger publisher, receiving hundreds of thousands of manuscripts, and that 2% chance drops even lower. That's just your chance of getting published by a legitimate press. Go to the library and look at some of the books recently published (not the bestsellers, but the other ones that you haven't heard of). Many of the authors have jobs on the side, perhaps hoping for fame and fortune, but writing because it's what they enjoy. You could become a teacher or professor to survive while you write. It would be rewarding (meeting influential, knowledgable people, working with others interested in the field), but even teaching positions at colleges are tough to get.<br>  So: it can be financially profitable, but it takes a lot of work, patience and perseverance. I've seen figures that the first Harry Potter book was rejected 9-12 times before anyone picked it up. I've seen stories that Stephen King's first book was rejected because the editor said, “We are not interested in science fiction with negative utopias.  They do not sell.”<br>  All that said, many profitable careers are difficult to get into. For every success story you'll find dozens...hundreds, maybe thousands or more...stories of failure. Whatever you decide to do, remember this first lesson about trying: if you put everything you have into the page, if you sacrifice nights of fun with friends and you sit in a room pumping out fifty pages a day, reading two books a week, your chances of making enough money to survive on fiction alone are slim at best. But if you plop in front of the TV or abandon the project because the screen names Cullen14 or KnowledgeableAuthor37 tell you it's not practical, your chances are zero. So your choices are 'slim' and 'none.' Pick the one that makes you happy.|`|ozBkHxuHaa	No fricking way. J.R.R.Tolkien is from another era. Meyers and Rowling are just two authors.

Your odds of becoming financially successful as a fiction are very slim with the odds of needing a full-time job being very high.<br>  <br>  Now, if you're a journalist, copywriter, or technical writer then that's another story. You have a greater chance at financial success with technical, non-fiction related writing careers than you do fiction.<br>  <br>  Most fiction writers work full-time and pursue their novel writing in their downtime as a hobby. Very few will ever get published, not counting self-publishing that is.

o1BDgJQTaa	basically...<br>  the entire monologue is about suicide. Ham is in a bit of a bad place right now, and he's debating with himself whether he should go ahead and top himself or keep enduring the pain of everyday life.<br>  <br>  He's so depressed that the worst downside of suicide he can think of is that once he dies, it might be like being asleep and so he'll be haunted by nightmares.<br>  <br>  This brings us to another main theme of the monologue, which is the "Fear of the known vs. Fear of the unknown". Hamlet thinks that the world he lives in now is unbearably terrible, but he is cowardly and is afraid that the afterlife will be equally terrible or worse.|`|4fdfdde77d4ab90611b82f1e76587a82aa	Hamlet uses lots of metaphorical language in his debate with himself. <br>  He is contemplating suicide as a means to escape his responsibilities. <br>  He has royal blood, and so some the imagery is of war, 'take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them'. <br>  He lists some of the things going on around him - his father slain, his mother sleeping with his father's murderer, Ophelia in love with him, but he not in love with her - in fact he increasingly thinks she has been sent by King Claudius to spy on him ('the pangs of despised love')<br>  <br>  He then likes death to sleeping. He has seen the dead - his father, slain AND his father as a ghost. his dead father looked at peace... the ghost wanders in apparent apparitional torment. Is that what would await himself? <br>  Look at all of the metaphors that Hamlet uses for death or dying... the speech is littered with them!
ItCOMhYGaa	The great depression was the largest economic downturn. It began in 1929 and ended around early 1940's. The econmic downturn started in the USA on october 29, 1929. The United states got out of it by its weapons production in 1941 when it entered world war II. <br>  <br>  As for Isolationism, America after world war I took on this mentality, that it was not our buisness to interfere with others political problems and not engage countries militarly. In World War II that started in 1939, America did not participate until 1941 with the bombing of pearl harbor by the japanese. <br>  <br>  Appeasement was a way to give hitler what he wanted so they would avoid war. When hitler took austria, Europe said "fine you can have it, but no more!" Appeasement is like giving a person a lollipop so you dont cause bigger problems.

Later he claimed he was not aware of the Soviet military actions in Lithuania.

1hvrQYWiaa	2 types of sword were very effective.In the west, the 2 handed heavy broadsword, upwards of 5 ' long and the main weapon of a knight on foot, wielded with sufficient room to give the user a full backswing before contact, would generate sufficient momentum at the point of contact to cut through anything.<br>   In Eastern Europe, the panzerstecher sword was developed to pierce full ammunition plate armour with a single straight overarm thrust. It had a narrow triangular blade and a specially hardened and sharpened  point. It was a favoured weapon of Transylvanian hussars. The sword was effective (as long as the thrust was delivered correctly) because it concentrated all the strength of the impact on a narrow point of the armour, meaning the surface tension of the armour (plate armour was designed to deflect blows) was being compromised, thus making it susceptible to such a stroke.|`|AA10755943	To kill the guy inside the armor, a very thin, pointed thrusting sword can easily be slipped between the plate overlaps creating puncture wounds that bleed profusely.  A quick swordsman, unarmored and with a thin foil blade, can defeat an armored knight in this manner.  It's not quick but it is effective - puncture then run and let the Knight bleed out.<br>  <br>  Another type is any blade heavy enough, wielded by a strong person, to do considerable smashing damage to the armor and its wearer.  Concussion, broken bones, cut off circulation and respiration due to severely dented armor will add up.<br>  <br>  My brother in law fights live steel. He sometimes speaks of cutting his opponent's armor straps, causing the armor to hang loosely and become a real liability.|`|xQwU590Laa	A two handed sword would have the weight and power to deliver a blow that might cut or crush thru the armor, but it gives up the defense of a shield.<br>    A light sword would probably not get in, and the armored person would certainly smash the light sword with his, or simply accept a blow while he cut his attacker in half.<br>    Check old sword fighting books, and they always recommend a decently strong and heavy sword, never a foil, for real combat.  A 1 and 1/2 pound sword beats a 12 oz sword every time.  Speed is only really affected when the swords get over 3 pounds or more.  Armor does a good job against light swords, so even if you are a little slower, you get the killing blow with a heavier sword.<br>    Of course, if you KNEW you were going to fight a plate armored man, you would pick something like an axe or mace instead of a sword.
fkwYvFBRaa	Hey. Writing is ONLY hard if you THINK it is hard. :)<br>  <br>  Maybe we should come to a consensus on the best possible ways on how to write your book with organization. I came up with several exercises and found some tips that seem to work for me:<br>  Step1<br>  <br>  Prepare materials: laptop, paper, pen (whatever that works). All of these must be handy and ready whenever you get to your writing pattern.<br>  Step2<br>  <br>  Get rid of all distractions such your iPod, pets, mobile phones and even food. They tend to divert your attention to what is actually important.<br>  Step3<br>  <br>  Establish a writing schedule and time. One hour is the least that you can allocate for writing. Placing an hourglass in front of you is adding pressure so you wouldn’t want any of that. Alarms work best.<br>  Step4<br>  <br>  Write, write, write.<br>  Step5<br>  <br>  Edit, edit, edit.<br>  <br>  I believe that the best way to write is to write freely. Being uninhibited with your writing can actually develop your writing skills because as you go along, you will create your own style and cultivate the kind of association that your readers will identify of your writing.<br>  <br>  Jessica Clark mentioned in her column that “you may even need to take it one word at a time”.

We all have to reconcile that fact, sooner or later in our lives.The only thing you will ever know for sure is what goes on inside of YOU.  From the moment life leaves the surface of your eyes, ears, and other parts, and goes out into the world, what you perceive is only what you perceive.  You will never know for sure what I am perceiving, even if I am looking at what you are looking at...you can never know for sure that I perceive it exactly as you do.  Therefore, each of us is limited by our perceptions.  Our eyes and ears and so forth act like sensors that go out into the world and detect and receive, input.  How we "know" what that input means, is totally subjective to the individual.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the world is an illusion because all I know for a fact is what is inside of ME and I do not know that ONE very well either.  But I can say this - learn to love yourself because you are all there really is.  Learn to go within.  There is an old saying about this:<br>  <br>  If you do not go within, you go without!<br>  <br>  Think about that one.  <br>  <br>  At first, it seems to say, that if you do not go within yourself then you are forced to define yourself by what you think you perceive other than yourself.  But then, upon closer scrutiny of that statement, it can mean, IF you do not go within (first), then you go without knowing who you are and that is the eternal definition of being LOST.  Those who do not know themselves best are the ones who are most lost in life.  When you come to know yourself, love yourself, be yourself, then you have found ONE PERSON, namely:  YOU who will always be there with you.<br>  <br>  There is another saying in life:<br>  <br>  The world is not outside you, it is inside you!<br>  <br>  So this says, that what you think you are experiencing being out there is really right there inside of YOU.  Don't laugh this off, think about it.  Put hard thought into it!  Could it be possible, I am the illusion and you are the only real person?  Or perhaps, you are my illusion and I am just writing this to myself!<br>  <br>  The only person you will ever have for sure, the only person you can really know, the only thing that you can count on to define every moment of your life is simply just YOU.<br>  <br>  So learn to love and appreciate yourself and be happy that you are you, whatever you are - just be happy being you because no matter how much you fight it, you cannot change any of this.  You will never be alone because there is always one person you can always count on to be there for you - YOU.<br>  <br>  See the magic in this!  Learn to be happy!  Smile, knowing you need nothing because you have it all, right there, in you.|`|AA11488628	i would say you are only alone if you want to be. if you are not depressed well then you must just be shutting yourself off from other people emotionally and maybe even physically. we are emotionally connected to just about everything on this planet so to ever truly feel alone well you have to had disconnected yourself from everything. so if you don't want to feel alone then you should do something that will make you feel connected again.|`|d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	Loneliness is a sense of feeling.<br>  Alone can be physical or mental,<br>  You feel distant because you have place yourself a mental barrier or to barricade yourself. At that point you can be alone even in a crowd.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	that feeling must mean you don't feel whole. or maybe you were just coming out of a situation that left apart of you open. and now you need something to fill the void. you must be missing something. thats my conclusion.|`|ZDFP11leaa	I know what you mean. We are always alone (in a sense)...we come into this world alone and we leave alone. Just my personal opinion|`|fpzwSlV9aa	Lack of heart to heart connection. Knowing the persons face, but...how well can we really know someone? When we dont accept ourselves, then others simply become mirrors. So, we know people only as mirrors, or worse, ideas. I have an idea of who you are, a more frightening thing cannot be said. if you violate that idea, god help you. But yes, we are alone, because we lack a heart to heart connection. Solution? Listen to someone like they are dying. Dont compare your experience, dont tell the story, just listen.|`|PToFyrz5aa	to be truly alone is to have total peace. I dont understand people, to be alone is not bad, if you can be alone with your self for a day is a wonder, try it, I did it for a week, and then for a month. That is total peace. Sure after that I needed people and thats natural, I am not a hermit, but I am not afraid to be alone, try it, do it for a few days, just go out and do your own thing, what ever it is, enjoy yourself, go hiking, go alone, go for lunch in some place you would never go, or have a picnic in a park twenty miles from home, take a journey, take a walk, got it???|`|c5c3dcc46e8efe1af1261fdadb5e541daa	There are so many variables to what you have asked that an accurate answer may not be possible. Like are you suffering from depression? Have you sought counseling? Are you on medication that might make you feel this way? In any case my best response is...If you are a believer in the spiritual world, you are never alone. Jesus has taught the lonely and broken need only call on Him and He will send the Holy Spirit to comfort you. Now while this warm fuzzy scenario sounds great, you actually have to BELIEVE you will feel better when you do it. In the end I would say if you are open to spiritual things, talk to a minister or spiritual counselor but also, if you don't seem to get better, seek medical help. I believe in my God but also can say that anti-depressants are WONDERFUL!!!|`|87231731cb32c6abdb725130f208078daa	Your lucky you have your friends around you. Mine have all gone off to college. The one thing that really helps me is prayer. I don't know if your religious or even have a religion but try and have a conversation with God. It really helps just to talk with him. He will always listen to you no matter what time it is. I hope he helps.|`|ofH9DWETaa	I understand. No matter how many people are here for me, I'm lonely. And the point you are alone is when you isolate yourself. Many people my LOVE you, but you can be lonely. Or you can have no family or friends and be very cheerful.

So badly did Lenin need their loyalty that he was prepared to do almost anything to get it. He decided that the best way was to take Russia out of the war. To do that, however, he had to make great sacrifices.<br>  In March of 1918, the Treaty of Brest / Litovsk was signed between Germany and Russia. According to the terms of that peace treaty, Russia lost more than one quarter of her agricultural land (Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Baltics), about a third of the nation's population, almost all of her coal mines, more than half of her industries and a large part of the nation's income.

It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>
c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	I found this for you.<br>  Surname: Marquez<br>  Recorded in over one hunded spelling forms from the English Mark, Marke and Markes, the French Marc, Marcq, the Italian and Spanish Marco and Marcos, to the Dutch Murkus, Czech Marek, and such diminitives as the Russian Markowitz and Markovski this ancient surname is Roman. It originates from the popular pre-Christian baptismal name "Marcus", itself a development of the word "mar", meaning to gleam, although there is also a possible asscoiation with "Mars", the god of war. The popularity of the name is closely associated with St Mark, the Evangelist, and author of the Second Gospel, although the surname itself is over one thousand years later. The name, as St Mark or St Marc, or Sanctus Marcus, was often applied in pre-medieval times to religious sanctuaries, monastery's, and other places of religion. These place names were particularly popular in Italy and Spain, and the south of France. The developing locational surnames were sometimes given either to the original lords of the village or region, and thereafter were adopted as hereditary surnames, or more usually the name was given as a form of identification to people who moved from their original homelands. It was then, and it often remains so today, that one of the easiest means of identifying a stranger is to call him or her by the name of the place or country from which they originate. Other popular examples of the surname spellings, the original name being recorded in every European country, include De Marco, Di Marko, Marcus, Marchi, Merck, Marck and Van der Marck, to Marconi, Marchitello, De Marchi, Marcovitch, Markushkin, and even Marczewski. The first known recording is probably that of Heinrich Mark, in the charters of the town of Biberach, Germany, in the year 1390. <br>  Hope this helps.|`|f3CHWDt7aa	Sorry but this word doesn't give a name like Marc, Marco, Markus, etc., cause Marquez comes from a territory called March or Mark, from whom derives, from the VIII century, the name Marquis, the chief of the Mark. Marquez is Marquis in Spanish. In Italian is Marchese. Along the time it became also a last name.

Scarlett talks about her family and social life at length, so unless you're used to reading classic novels that often go at that pace, you may struggle at first.  <br>  <br>  A lot of people dislike the novel because they interpret it as shallow and dislike Scarlett, calling her shallow as well...and...she is!  But she's definitely no Mary Sue.  Her character (thankfully) goes much deeper than that.<br>  <br>  You may as well give it a shot.  I feel it's one of those classic novels everyone must read, since it's alluded to quite a bit in various forms.<br>  <br>  If you want a variety of opinions, look no further than Amazon.com...book reviews galore!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gone-Wind-Margaret-Mitchell/dp/0446365386" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Gone-Wind-Margaret...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|eIP7y4gNaa	I have read it twice and absolutely loved it!

If you lift weights, you ought to know that anyways.  Once you continue to build up your capabilities, your muscles will be able to make those clean, pristine, and sharp motions. <br>  <br>  When you go slow, try to think of making each and individual muscle move at a time.  When performing or whatever, I agree about being smooth by focusing the attention on particular muscles.|`|3qWxd9HNaa	Change your style, go gently.|`|6RrmmDyLaa	You have to put all the muscle you can into the move and then forcefully stop.

It is most likely that an agent in LA will not be interested in you anyway unless you have a great look and resume.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	No agent is going to work with someone who can't make it to auditions on short notice.

You can find basic RIT dies anywhere.<br>  <br>  Silk uses different dies, needs fixers, and is more expensive and more fragile.<br>  <br>  Coloring rayon and other man-made fibers is another ball of wax, not the first thing you want to try.

3XNUUfFyaa	Acrylic paint will stick to almost anything but it is formulated to be painted on canvas or wood boards that are gessoed first. It is made to be used by artists to paint on flat surfaces that don't get much movement like a piece of clothing wood. Also acrylic paint is usually heavy body instead of very fluid. Fabric paint is made to use on fabric therefore it is especially formulated to take the abuse that clothing will take during everyday use. Also it is formulated to saturate the fabric so it will stay in place. If you are not shure of what you want to buy I would contact the manufacturer of each product and ask them directly.

The Mughals when came to power in these places they made sure they demolished the temples and build their own monuments. Today we know this after several years it might change.

b9qqQt7maa	Neither exist, the idea of higher power is basically just a tool to control the masses (sorry if i insult anyone)|`|SBYbP0A6aa	I believe God & Devil are two different things. As God was already there before everything, Devil was also there before life bloomed.<br>  <br>  Both God & Devil are powerful & can be considered as two sides of a coin. God created his own Beautiful world & Devil created his own demons.<br>  <br>  Now if you ask me how Devil was created, I'll answer you but after you tell me how God was created.<br>  <br>  And from above, no question of forgiving arises. I believe God is much more powerfull than the Devil therefore demons also sometime like to take God's shade. His extereme love is everything.<br>  <br>  Well I'm going offtrack-I hope I've answered what you wanted to know?|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	First of all, the legend that Lucifer was once a beautiful angel in heaven and sat at the left of Gods throne, became jealous and envious of God and gathered up as many other angels as he could to over throw God and take over the throne, then was cast out of heaven because of his actions is no more than Theological MYTHOLOGY!! <br>  <br>  There is not one speck of proof of any of this whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Also how on earth would any Man know what the "Spirit-tics" in heaven were back so far it would be unmeasurable in Earth time before man was ever created? <br>  <br>  So because it is all Myth and no proof whatsoever I think its safe to say that the origin of mans choice to do wicked things is probably not from the influence of a bitter fallen angel. <br>  <br>  The fact that humans do engage in "Evil" ways could just be due to the possibility that its part of our nature and has nothing to do with higher powers of Good or Evil.|`|HORACAnlaa	The real question is; why do people believe in this mystical sounding nonsense? It's faith believe anything you like because someone else will believe in it the way they want. Here's the rules as I understand: God is an all powerful being, beyond the understanding of any human, that you're trying to understand. Maybe the devil created God so he had someone to torture. Maybe God is really the devil and it's one big mind game. Maybe God exists but he didn't establish any moral values. With faith you can believe anything you like. Maybe the rational answer is just get rid of God all together and embrace reason.|`|peDJSnQPaa	he didn't create the devil <br>  lucifer was an angel first, so the devil is a fallen angel.|`|fF1WbPltaa	God is a creation of man's mind.

It shows that this guy isnt a coward.<br>  <br>  But mainly its obvious he is trying to impress, when he brags or talks greatly of himself. another thing is that we show what we are good at, like being a great talker, or a great artist, or a great fashion, or a great attitude.|`|da1UKp8Maa	This is a common topic of study in the field of Psychology. Pick up a book on human sexuality and it will probably have some common signs.<br>  <br>  Some that I can remember at the moment are that they will be making large gestures, and generally positioning themselves in a way that shows off their chest. Be this through leaning back or stretching. Though the bit about showing off the chest is very subtle, and the guy is not aware they are doing this. Do the research, and you will find what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that the signs are different for women. Some I can remember for them are shrugging, showing off the neck, darting glances. That is not a complete list, but if you find the studies for males, you will find it for females as well.|`|KGmx9wKxaa	The guy wants to impress you when you notice him doing actions just to please you. That even if you look so busy, he'd try to bug you just so he'd catch your eyes. Nonetheless, he would tease you..

da1UKp8Maa	This is a common paradox used to argue the nonexistence of God. The idea is that if he can lift the rock, then he cannot create a rock he cannot lift. So he is not all powerful. However, if he cannot lift the rock then he is not all powerful since he couldn't lift it.<br>  <br>  So you are not supposed to come to a yes or no answer, but the realization that there is no way that God can be all powerful. At least according to this argument.|`|kGjnH34laa	That's a hard question and is contradictory as well.  If he was all powerful I would say that he could create a rock heavier than he could lift, however, if he was all powerful, he'd have all the strength in the universe which would mean he'd be able to lift anything.  So who knows?  :)|`|aCDucMOqaa	Yes. But then he would become powerful enough to lift it. So no.. Dunno here its kinda both ways|`|a7pCUHoiaa	This is where religious people throw up their hands and say <br>  "I don't know! isn't God amazing?"<br>  <br>  This is where skeptics say "It's impossible to determine with the given information, but the religious people sure are stupid for not realizing how ridiculous the concept of existence of an omnipotent God is..."<br>  <br>  This is where I say "Who cares?" [my middle name in a foreign language xD]<br>  <br>  Just kidding lol. This is a good question... I'll ask my pastor ;P|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...god is a creation of man...<br>  ...thus the object is mechanically lifted when its to heavy for man...|`|AlybkawCaa	Our loving Father-Infinite I AM is not only all-powerful; He is also all existential Reality. (Reality above space-time needed limitations for man to begin to strike step with Eternity and Paradise and thus transcend time and space.)<br>  <br>  You need to also realize that God will never do any stupid or ungodly thing.  There is no real Eternal Deity Purpose in His and our spiritual Finality-Destiny to create such a huge rock, anymore than creating a huge "BB" pellet, bigger than a billion galaxies, to be shot out of a much larger BB gun ! Oops, sorry ! The spiritually puerile thinking advocates of the "big bang theory" would like that !  Ha ha<br>  <br>  Since energy is more real than matter; you could have asked: "Can God create an energy so large He can not control it ?"   Answer: No, as God has now infinite Personality Presence Gravity Energy and infinite Spirit Presence Gravity Energy and infinite Mind Presence Gravity Energy and infinite Paradise Force-Energy Presence Gravity Energy, and much more without limit !  The math genius Georg Cantor proved that there can be an unlimited number of infinities ! (and they are all stable and orderly, now and eternally, in God's perfect will.)<br>  <br>  Peace and progress in Spirit and in Truth !|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	You could just make up anything but Yes God can do anything. No offense to Christians but the bible is made up. Sorry if this offends anyone. A bunch of hallucinating people making up stories for people to believe in.|`|zyzVSQfgaa	i tried calling the loch ness monster to get his thoughts on this one but he wasnt in sorry cant help|`|mw1ZOxAaaa	yes. the third rock from the sun.<br>  no sign of god in there.|`|03k5qduQaa	Lifting of the rock requires overcoming matter, and the matter of impediments obstructing and causing duality in Gods concerted efforts. The rock melts to dust and its light and energy freed, until God releases it is harnessed and exploited against it. What do need God may have to lift the rock is overtaken by the matter feeding from the rocks weight and presence. This is a moral dilemma for God exposing a weakness if he fails to extract the rock. He is assisted or influenced by the exploiters and captors of the rock to his detriment if he is seen to be duplicitous and thereby weal, no matter how his cunning adversaries in allied form contrive to lead thinking to the contrary. God’s weapon of mass conversion in the hands of those who profess to belive in him will become his undoing, as was as history relates. The rock is reduced to matter, and God remains nonexistent...|`|VM9Vsf9naa	I think I've seen that question more than a dozen times lately, lol.<br>  <br>  God is omnipotent and He is also omnipresent, which means He is also in the rock. There is no separation in God, the Universal Consciousness. What you need to do first of all is to realize that God is Infinite. May I quote a few lines from a special book:<br>  <br>  a) There cannot be one particle of substance that is not of God. Every particle in the whole Universe must be of God, for it is God alone who is expressing Himself, and I and the Father are one, there is no separation between us.<br>  <br>  b) Understand that the great Truth of the Omnipresence, the Omnipotence and the Omniscience of God is complete. Know that it is He Who lives, and He alone lives, in every living thing because He created all of them and He could not live apart from His creations, for He is omnipresent.<br>  <br>  c) If His creations were in any way separated from Him He could not be Infinite in nature, He could not be complete in Himself. Every creation was created with the fundamental principle of Love harmonising every action, bringing into manifestation His Divine nature. And when man becomes aware of this Truth, then shall man create in himself the reflection of that perfect Divinity which will bring about his Heaven on earth.|`|hhPKGOWPaa	Yes. He already did. He created mountains, volcanoes, and rocks. God is powerful, he has all the power to do everything. With God all things are possible. He's the source of life on earth.|`|zc6SDlMaaa	Here's a thing, if god is so powerful he doesn't need pathetic humans to worship him, he doesn't need anything at all, and most of all he doesn't even need to exist, so he doesn't.|`|ZiYLLh6Iaa	no cuz he would be the rock, he is all powerful and so would lift the rock, there is nothing he can't do|`|snNPwf1Maa	No.|`|j7MVgF6laa	Yes , He has created your head already.|`|YkZa3SXyaa	LOL .... that is all  I can say.
RlqGouOXaa	I think you have done a fantastic job!

The way you worked in all the little things that made life miserable and how you felt about it all was very creative. Good job! <br>  I do have one suggestion: Address the letter to a friend rather than your sweetheart. As a rule when one is in a bad and dangerous situation one doesn't tell all the nitty gritty details to one's girlfriend or parents for that matter. You don't want them to worry about you. Letters to them are usually upbeat and lighthearted. The things you mention were usually reserved for letters to friends or maybe a brother or uncle.<br>  Just an idea. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing about the letter.|`|NYU37jfGaa	It's a rather gloomy letter.  A soldier writing home would be more likely to try and cheer his family up than make them feel sad.  He would tell them about his friends, about jokes people had made, he might grumbe a bit about the cold, mud etc, but he wouldn't want to dwell on it and make his family miserable.<br>  <br>  Most people fighting in the war didn't think it was pointless, they thought they were fighting to defend their country against the enemy (as indeed they were).  It is unlikely that most soldiers writing home would whine self-pityingly like this.  Men were not raised to be whingers in those days.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	ha ha I had to do that for social studies at year 7 as well<br>  <br>  You did really well way better what I did at year 7.

(I still have mine from when I was little) You could pt some sort of clue about James in the dance studio Bella went to when she was little and wher James ricked into going.

Sickness called paranoia which makes you feel that people around you are all traitors and want you bad. So He called them people enemies and employed all means to torture them and kill. He demanded in the regions of URSS to discover a given number of people enemies. This prompted to arrest innocent and kill or put in camps called gulags. <br>  It can be explained by the fact that after WORLD WAR 1 , URSS knew a civil war with atrocities in both side. But When came the most <br>  horrible totalitarianism , civil war was ended since 15 years|`|0OJ43kpsaa	WHAT?? Stalin's regime is the very best example of a totalitairian regime!<br>  <br>  Define "totalitarian": rule by fear and a willingness to murder your own citizens in MILLIONS.

We decide how to interpret ideas.  When we accept their looseness, our perspective changes dramatically.  We boast with our ideas.  We rant with our ideas.  We woo ourselves with our sublime ideas.  In the end, however, there is little ideas can teach us, and what we do know in fact is so humdrum, that we don't even take notice.  Facts have no romance; no firepower.  Notions are more like potions, in that they give us a sense of superficial confidence in a time of need - and that need dissipates after we use them like the way hunger is satiated with food.  Ideas are like clothes on a rack, we try them on every once in a while, but we don't really wear them for long.  Knowing ideas is knowing very little.

AA10729271	Well, because all the young men were fighting, for the first time in pre modern Society women were allowed (more like desperately needed) to join the regular labour force, and many of them went to factories to help assemble weapons etc. for the war effort.<br>  <br>  Also, you have probably heard the phrase "son of a gun" that originates in all the bastards that were born as a result of affairs soldiers had with women both away and at home. Many of the men might have 'done the right thing' given a chance, except they died in battle. It led to a general lessening of the social stigma attached to out of wedlock children, since they are a part of the baby boomer population.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, some women took on jobs that had traditionally been done by men, working with heavy machinery, going into farming and forestry etc.  However, it is not true (as some people seem to imagine) that women did not work before the war.  There were 14 million working women in the USA before WW2, so there was nothing unusual about women working.  Single women always had to work for al iving, and so did many poor married women. Some women took on different kinds of jobs during the war, but most of the women who worked during the war had been working before the war, and would continue to work after the war.<br>  <br>  Honestly, why do so many people seem to think that women didn't work before WW2?  How on earth do people imagine that single woman and poor women supported themselves? Do they think they lived on air or something?<br>  <br>  The number of housewives who went to work has been exaggerated.  According to Gail collins in 'america's Women', nearly 90 percent of housewives who were at home at the time of Pearl Harbour stayed there.  Slaving away in factories was of limited appeal to many married women.  Jobs in factories appealed mainly to women who were able to improve their economic status by leaving badly paid jobs for defense work.|`|wMG4DLH1aa	The Second World War was a period in which women were able to step away (in most cases) from their traditional roles as wives and mothers and undertake work which was previously seen as exclusively for men. The same took place during the First World War. Factory work is a classic example of women becoming involved in "men's work" at this time<br>  <br>  However, this period often comes under close scrutiny from historians whose views on the subject differ vastly. Whilst it cannot be denied that during the war women were able to step into the male sphere of work, it cannot be ignored that women had to continue being housekeepers at the same time. This is often referred to as the double burden. <br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that the war did create an awareness that women were just as capable as men in terms of work which obviously differed from the traditional views of society at that time. However, I maintain my point that whilst this was a small step, women were still expected to perform their traditional roles as wives and mothers at the same time. <br>  <br>  I hope this has helped!|`|da1UKp8Maa	They were working in factories building all the tanks, planes, and etc. as opposed to maintaining the home. Essentially, all the men were off fighting the war, so women had to step out of their traditional roles to fill in the gaps. Think about the iconic image of Rosie the Riveter.

ceBTTCPwaa	Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830– May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room.

0OJ43kpsaa	The Cotton Gin was NOT "the thing" which created the Industrial Revolution. Consider--<br>  <br>  1. farming improvements in the UK in the 1600s enabled more people to be fed.<br>  <br>  2. the Enclosure Acts forced small holders off the land into cities.<br>  <br>  3. This created a pool of cheap labour, hungry for jobs (there was no Dole back then).<br>  <br>  4. The Cotton Gin made it possible to bale cotton cheaper. Vastly cheaper cotton made it MUCH cheaper to make textiles, and it was the textile industry where automation began, along with railways and other early applications for steam engines.<br>  <br>  But you cannot consider the Gin ("Capital equipment") without discussing Labour and looking at how mechanical reliability changed the face of society, e.g. Clipper ships replaced by propellor-driven ships, regular and reliable railways replace canal barges.<br>  <br>  Competition created the Industrial Revolution, not the Gin. No-one wanted to be the last person using old technology, or have the railways go around their town.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Southern planters were in desperate need of a way to make the growing of cotton profitable. Long-staple cotton, which was easy to separate from its seeds, could be grown only along the coast. The one variety that grew inland had sticky green seeds that were time-consuming to pick out of the fluffy white cotton bolls. Whitney was encouraged to find a solution to this problem by his employer, Catherine Greene, whose support, both moral and financial were critical to this effort. At stake was the success of cotton planting throughout the South, especially important at a time when tobacco was declining in profit due to over-supply and soil exhaustion.<br>  <br>  Whitney knew that if he could invent such a machine, he could apply to the federal government for a patent. If granted, he would have exclusive rights to his invention for 14 years (today it is 20 years), and he could hope to reap a handsome profit from it.<br>  <br>  But patenting an invention and making a profit from it are two different things. After considering possible options, Whitney and his business partner, Phineas Miller, opted to produce as many gins as possible, install them throughout Georgia and the South, and charge farmers a fee for doing the ginning for them. Their charge was two-fifths of the profit -- paid to them in cotton itself.<br>  <br>  And here, all their troubles began. Farmers throughout Georgia resented having to go to Whitney's gins where they had to pay what they regarded as an exorbitant tax. Instead planters began making their own versions of Whitney's gin and claiming they were "new" inventions. Miller brought costly suits against the owners of these pirated versions but because of a loophole in the wording of the 1793 patent act, they were unable to win any suits until 1800, when the law was changed.<br>  <br>  Struggling to make a profit and mired in legal battles, the partners finally agreed to license gins at a reasonable price. In 1802 South Carolina agreed to purchase Whitney's patent right for $50,000 but delayed in paying it. The partners also arranged to sell the patent rights to North Carolina and Tennessee. By the time even the Georgia courts recognized the wrongs done to Whitney, only one year of his patent remained. In 1808 and again in 1812 he humbly petitioned Congress for a renewal of his patent.<br>  <br>  The Effects of the Cotton Gin<br>  <br>  After the invention of the cotton gin, the yield of raw cotton doubled each decade after 1800. Demand was fueled by other inventions of the Industrial Revolution, such as the machines to spin and weave it and the steamboat to transport it. By mid century America was growing three-quarters of the world's supply of cotton, most of it shipped to England or New England where it was manufactured into cloth. During this time tobacco fell in value, rice exports at best stayed steady, and sugar began to thrive, but only in Louisiana. At mid century the South provided three-fifths of America's exports -- most of it in cotton.<br>  <br>  However, like many inventors, Whitney (who died in 1825) could not have foreseen the ways in which his invention would change society for the worse. The most significant of these was the growth of slavery. While it was true that the cotton gin reduced the labor of removing seeds, it did not reduce the need for slaves to grow and pick the cotton. In fact, the opposite occurred. Cotton growing became so profitable for the planters that it greatly increased their demand for both land and slave labor. In 1790 there were six slave states; in 1860 there were 15. From 1790 until Congress banned the importation of slaves from Africa in 1808, Southerners imported 80,000 Africans. By 1860 approximately one in three Southerners was a slave.<br>  <br>  Because of the cotton gin, slaves now labored on ever-larger plantations where work was more regimented and relentless. As large plantations spread into the Southwest, the price of slaves and land inhibited the growth of cities and industries. In the 1850s seven-eighths of all immigrants settled in the North, where they found 72% of the nation's manufacturing capacity. The growth of the "peculiar institution" was affecting many aspects of Southern life.
3XNUUfFyaa	Yes you can, there are two ways. One way is to remove the varnish, yes it can be done and is done by restorers all the time to put new one one. The second one is to paint over the varnish, it is a nightmare to the restorers in the future.But who cares, if the painting is not good anyways that it has to be fixed up than it might as well be painted over. And in the end will you really worry about critics and restorers after you die,I won't.
