I'm putting this in LGBT because the man I'm asking this question for is gay, so I wanted to get your responses.      My friend David has had cerebral palsy since birth. He's early-40s, and when he's in his wheelchair, he's pretty mobile, so he can go on dates and such. However, he does have caretakers who look after him to make sure nothing bad happens (they don't go on his dates!).      The question is, if you met such a person and ended up liking them, would you date them and/or be open to developing a relationship with them? I'd appreciate responses from both men and women, if at all possible.      David and I have a long-running argument: I say there are indeed men out there who would fall in love with him and it would be unconditional. He argues that nobody would want him because he's in a wheelchair and requires pretty constant care.      Serious question, people, okay? So no stupid answers please? Thanks in advance to all who answer.

Thanks.      + Also interested in paraphillias, so any tips that focus more on this are also helpful. The DSM-IV-TR attempts to categorize, but I'm interested in treating it from afresh, so for example you might believe its not use categorizing, and would prefer them simply to be organized according to a suggestion.   Cheers :)

"written" in other words.    so, the choices we make (either good or bad) are part of his plan. there is nothing we can do about it. every action we make has already been written, we're just following through. is that right?       so why can't i say that it was god's plan when some one does something wrong? i kind of figured that it might be rude to some people.

Alright, i am a healthy 18 year old male, i am very active (i play ALOT of basketball) so my question is what age should i cut down on use/stop using all together. I smoke about a blunt a night before i go to bed to unwind from stressful issues/things that happened that day. Also, i am not addicted to marijuana, i am a very responsible user. Thank you guys so much, any responces appreciated.

20090304134547AA2IB8o	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Question about porn...?	Ok, I see on here a lot of people, most of whom are younger that have no issues with porn. They don't think its wrong. Now, i'm not saying its all bad, I watch it with my wife, very occasionally though. I remember, and not that long ago, I'm only 30, that porn was so taboo. You would have to get a magazine, or a video from an actual store. It was really not a huge issue, and it was something that you kept hidden for sure.      But now, with porn so easily accessible on the internet, so many people are watching it, and from a very young age. I see this as being a serious problem with todays society. Do none of you see the problems that can arise from porn? Especially with it being so easy to get now days? I mean addiction, relationship problems, etc... Why are so many young people so casual about porn, and sex in general?

Okay,i am using my little sister's account.I love this man so deeply..and we have been together a year,we are really soul mates and we get along so well.:) we even think the same ways etc.etc.He is mixed with a lot of things..      while i'm just the typical black,white,and native american mix(my mom is 1/4 japanese which makes me 1/8 which is just less than 16 percent..so i don't even claim being part japanese.)I go by the title black indian because my father is half creek indian.My fiancee is mixed with bajan(barbadian or black),jamaican(black),Chinese,Japanese,... native american..but he is dark with long hair,and a native american/aqueline nose,with medium sized lips and I am light skinned,medium built,short,with long hair,and almond shaped eyes and super small lips with a weird facial structure(it's like a native americans because I have large cheekbones lol)and i'm not sure why but I used to feel like he deserved another mixed woman and that I wasn't worthy of him..I don't know why I feel like that because mixed women are no better than a single race woman..I was wondering,what could be the root of these feelings,and how can I overcome them?thanxs

I cannot think of anything more hateful or unloving than the use of petroleum and it is nearly part of every aspect of our daily lives.

20090304134441AAYVBO2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, what are your views on these statements from the Cathechism of the Catholic Church?	867 The Church is holy: the Most High God is her author; Christ, her bridegroom, gave himself up to make her holy; the Spirit of holiness gives her life. Since she still includes sinners, she is "the sinless one made up of sinners." Her holiness shines in the saints; in Mary she is already all-holy.      882 The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor "is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishop and of the whole company of the faithful". "For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as the Vicar of Christ, and as a pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered."
20090304132409AAE0wXy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people always say that their god will never put more on you than you can handle?	What about children who are molested?   Did their god think that the kiddies could "handle" that?   What about burn victims?   He must have thought those guys were some pretty strong individuals, huh?   I guess he thought that all those millions of children who have starved to death from malnutrition could handle being hungry for that long too.   Obviously, they couldn't.   Did he miscalculate?   Oh well, let's just blame it on our imaginary devil like we always do.   Or we could just blame ourselves because of our "sins".   Although I don't see what my masturbation or Eve's munching an apple has to do with kids dying.   Oh well, I guess we don't have to understand anything, it's better to just be ignorant of, well, pretty much everything.   God can handle it, he's done a bang up job so far, right?   Even if he does "miscalculate" from time to time.   "Mysterious ways", right?   __________________________      (Eyes rolling completely out of skull!)

My brother and I went to our favorite restaurant for coffee. The restaurant was called "Ms. Maria's Cafe"  The coffee is delicious on a rainy day. A scary monster known as the Chupacabra was also in town and the sky was dark. When we got to the restaurant, the waitress said, "Welcome!" and sat us at a table near the window.      My brother looked out the window. He saw the Chupacabra. "Listen!", he said. Yes, it was the Chupacabra. The Chupacabra was crazy and ugly. It looked like a witch.      "Hurry!", my brother said. We ran out the door. We went to the park. I saw my friends there with a man and woman. The people had seen the Chupacabra yesterday. We were living the crazy life.      I woke up. My scary dream was over. That was very important to me. The Chupacabra was fake. Or is it?

20090304143000AABeIoP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Catholics...?	What does being Catholic mean to you? Why do you like the religion so much? Do you feel close to God? What are your thoughts about saints and Mary and how do they help with your walk with the Lord?      Also, do you think its okay for a Catholic to join a (nondenominational) christian Bible study?      And, I am looking for a good Bible. Not a necessity, but I would like a new one if I find one I like. Here are some things i like in my Bibles:   -"extras" (I dont know what they are called, but the things that are bonus to the Scripture that reflect on certain verses and how they apply to us)   -Concordinance   - if possible, daily (or sunday) readings.       Thanks so much.. I am a "boarder line Catholic" meaning that I use both Catholic and Protestant things and go to both kinds of church services.

20090304155104AAyFw7n	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this not hypocrisy? (take 2)?	I just asked this but it was too long so I had to trim it a little. This was found by me on the internet and figured I'd post it here.       "I did some reading of the book of Leviticus. My question is this: why do fundamentalists believe it is ok to pick and choose which verses to interpret literally and which to just throw out the door?      "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination," (Leviticus 18:22) and "If a man lie with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them." (Leviticus 20:13). Both of the above quotes are taken literally by fundamentalists.       The following verses are not, thankfully taken literally:      1) "For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him."    (Leviticus 20:9)    2) "Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property." (Leviticus 25:44-45)    3) "If a man lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness, he has discovered her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from her people." (Leviticus 20:18)   4) "Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard." (Leviticus 19:27) Gotta go throw away all the razors!   5) "...and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, is unclean to you." (Leviticus 11:7)    6) "...do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear material woven of two kinds of material." (Leviticus 19:19)    7) "But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that move in the water or any living thing which is in the water, they are an abomination to you." (Leviticus 11:10)       If the bible says that a man should not lie with a man, then reasoning would tell mt that that person should eat no shellfish or pork, wear only 100% cotton (or other material) clothes, never have sex during a woman's period or risk deportation (to where?,) be killed if s/he dares to disrespect a parent, own slaves, plant more than one crop in a particular place, or shave a beard and cut the sides of the hair. I'm not seeing too many fundamentalist Christians who follow all of these 'rules' from Leviticus. In fact, I know of NO-ONE who follows all the rules. Are they all going to hell?      It is because of these hypocritical inconsistencies with certain religions, particularly the homophobic fundamentalist ones, that have caused me to become agnostic, or perhaps even atheist (the jury's out on that one still.) So please, somebody enlighten me as to why fundamentalists literally interpret some bible verses from the book of Leviticus, but not all of them. Is this not hypocrisy?"

I have recently decided I do not believe in god, because i actually let my mind ask the questions that I dare not ask before.  I felt like it was a revelation. I have some questions that i would liked answered. no rude answers please.      1. If god is real then why does every religion think the other ones are wrong? that does not seem to be the christian thing to do.   2. Why do people go out to eat after church where a restaurant full of people that are forced to work on the sabbath? does not seem right.   3. Why has god never made me feel like he was in my heart when I asked him to be?   4. If people did not know there was a universe then why didn't god tell them in the bible?   5. Why is it that the bible starts in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. The word heavens comes from a word meaning clouds. Doesn't that mean a man just said what he saw which was the clouds and the earth?   6.if your soul goes to heaven or hell who is going to rule the people in hell when god beats the devil at the end of time?      sorry so long.

20090304160152AAR9cYH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should Christians be held accountable for following their God?	Like Hitler, "God" through his soldiers, has killed millions. his own book details the horrific slaughter of innocent men, women, and children. Not just murder but despicable acts of cruelty. This is in the bible that Christians follow and have belief in. The defend it by stating that those stories are in the OT and that Jesus preaches Love. Of course they still claim their God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. So he can't be both the loving God and the ruthless one. Then they say since God made them he can do what he wants. I say what a Nazi thing to say. These Christians, hell muslims too for that matter are a dangerous cult. They believe in this Book of their God so intently that it is only a matter of time before they try and wipe the infidels and unbelievers off the earth. Christians, Muslims, and Nazis belong on the same shelf. Maybe we should have trials holding them accountable for the actions of their God?

20090304145636AAdMlDb	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why are my boyfriend's GAY friends trying to convince him that he is either straight or bi?	My boyfriend is a very masculine guy and I'm extremely feminine. I wear SOME make up, I crossdress(I'm NOT transgender), I have a soft voice, very long hair, a petite frame and I often get mistaken for a girl. I HATE that. But news flash, I'm a guy and I accept it and I'm proud of it. Anyway, my boyfriends gay and bi male friends aren't convinced that my boyfriend is "fully gay" because he's dating a guy who outfemmes the average woman and he's a top. However, he's a STAUNCH, STRICT top, he wouldn't even TOUCH my "you know". He says he likes men but he doesn't like penises. I think that's weird too. But his friends know that about him and they say there is no way he can be completely gay if he's dating a guy who "looks and acts like a girl" and he doesn't like penises. But I guarantee you, my boyfriend is not straight or even bi. He does NOT like women at all. My boyfriend says the only that distinguishes me from a woman is my anatomy and that is why he's attracted to me. So it is a bit ironic that he doesn't like penises. But I hate how is friends are acting. Why is this type of situation so confusing to some people? Logical answers please.

20090304153527AAyy6ro	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Believers, how can you be so sure your beliefs aren't misplaced?	The ancient Egyptians had their own religion, beliefs and scriptures.  At that time they believed in their religion just as strongly as you believed in yours.  Their religious scriptures were, for them, the word of god.  Just like your scriptures are the word of god for you.  Yet now, no one believes in those god's anymore.  We view it as mythology.  It is a dead religion that no one believes in anymore.        Ancient Rome and Greece had thier gods, beliefs and scriptures.  Just like you, they believed they were right.  That they were following the words of their gods.  Yet now, just like the religion of ancient Egypt, we view their religion as mythology.  No one worships those gods, no one believes that those views are factual.      So, how can you be soooooo certain that your beliefs, religion, scriptures are any more accurate than these ones that came before yours.  DO NOT say that you have the bible and that it is the word of god, and that it says so in the bible.  They also had their own religious texts, they also believed it as the word of god.        How can you not realize that you are just as mis guided as those that came before you.  That your beliefs are nothing more than modern mythology.  Do you not realize that a thousand years from now people will look at your beliefs with the same attitude that we look at mythology now?        You can see the holes in the religions of the past and laugh at the niaevete of man in those times, yet you will not allow yourselves to see the holes in your own religions, you refuse to see how niaeve you are being.

20090304143920AAVQsol	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is the common "flamingly homosexual" role due to prejudice?	It may seems like a strange question.. but let me explain.      I am completely accepting of any gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation. I would like to make a non-prejudicial observation, however.      I have been curious for a while, whether the flamingly homosexual, feminine, uber-proud gay man is a direct result of years of prejudice toward homosexuality. Do some gay men feel like they need to take on a certain role in order to be accepted, and constantly show their pride? I just believe that if there were virtually no prejudice towards gays in history, such a stereotype would not exist. In order to be gay, you wouldn't need to be shouting your gay pride or talking like a girl. Being gay would be a much more quiet thing.       Are years of prejudice against homosexuality the cause of such a "flamingly gay" community of gay men? In short, I am curious to whether feminine gay men are only taking on a role to be accepted because they feel like the have to prove "they don't give a f*ck" to homophobes.      Please don't take offense to this, If I did offend you by my diction I apoligize but it's difficult to express what I'm trying to say.

I really need some tips and stuff to get motivated, with suffering from depression and not really being motivated to do anything and when I try to be motivated I just seem to be blank.      I have talked to my councellor and so on about this but nothing seems to help, I really want to go the gym and go out more but I dont seem to keep it up as theres no motivating there.

20090304135459AARDgMi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: do you ‘believe’ there is no god or gods or do you feel that if there’s no evidence…?	…there’s no point in having an opinion either way? Because believing there is no god or gods is like believing there is no Flying Spaghetti Monster or Invisible Pink Unicorn or Almighty Ceiling Cat or any other mythical entity that either is or was once believed by humans or one that you just made up on the spot. You know, what’s the point in having an opinion when there’s no evidence either way, because if you do have an opinion about a god or gods, then that means to be logically consistent you need to have an opinion about an infinite number of other mythical entities that anyone with an imagination can claim exists, right?       There are only two options regarding ones perception of reality; what one knows is true and what one hopes (or fears) is true, right? If one wants to build their perception of reality based on what one hopes or fears is true, then that’s their prerogative; they can add these optional extras to their perception of reality if they want to but in no way is it a prerequisite to being a human. In fact, it’s more like a human weakness or defect to waste ones life believing an illusion, right? One can be perfectly content dealing just with what one knows is true. This is what atheists do, right? Beliefs, hope, fear, you know, all these emotions don’t interfere with an atheist’s perception of reality, right?

I still think girls are hot and stuff.. but not so much on guys. i prefer to look at women but a nude women does not turn me on that much. I can pretty much see my self enjoying sex with both sexes i guess. more so with a women. so would this make me Bi or just another stage in puberty that will eventually pass and i will be straight again.       i have liked women all my life thats (not true... i think i may have liked a guy in kindergarten i think :S)    but since last night i started getting erections from gay sex thoughts.   so what do you guys think i am?

I was reading an autobiography about this woman who lived in a very isolated place in North Carolina - she had no electricity etc and all her realations on both sides could be traced back to the same area of NC. however she used words to describe things that we use here in Ireland - for instance she called a cupboard a press. An airing cupboard a hot press. a drawing pin was a thumb tack an eraser was a rubber and a pencil sharpener was a topper.      Thats how we describe those things here in ireland. she lives in a landlocked part of the States. Did they copy us or did we copy them - how is this possible -  could they all be related to irish people who emigrated to the states and if so why would they chose to go so far inland. have tried to do some research with no luck   thanks all

It would be a nice shortcut if we could get biblical interpretations or personal revelations directly from the Holy Spirit. However, most people who claim such private revelations seem to be at odds with the original Christians, e.g., on whether baptism is necessary for Christians.  Should all revelations from the Holy Spirit agree, or are there multiple truths?

20090304135501AAmgNHy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you please help me? I would really appreciate your help.?	Ok, I want thank all of you for your help last week Feb. 26th. - couple updates have surfaced and I don't know what to do - what woud you do or should I do?      Old Post. Feb. 26th:   Ok, I am not saying this happened at all. I'm just gonna say this is a hypothetical situation and hypothetical question.      Hypothetical Question - may not be real. (I'm saying this for my protection). Would If I told you my new boyfriend of 2 weeks MAY HAVE lost his cool with me today - physically.    We were having an argument and he threw me on the bed and held his arm over my front neck and screamed "look at me!!!!!!!!". He looked like such a monster or mad man (in his eyes) when he was telling me to look at him. He simply didn't look like the man I Met. Again Hypothetical situation. Minutes later he had twisted my arm - it was so extremely painful - I screamed and "said I"m sorry - I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!"   You would think that would make him stop. But he just twisted it more and asked me to say stuff I couldn't understand. So I kept saying "i'm sorry, I'm sorry". MOre like screaming it cause I was in severe pain. I thought my shoulder would break. He twisted 3 times before he let up.   The best example of this scene is from a movie "Kill Bill". Remember in the movie when Uma's trainer was twisting her arm really bad. It was eerily like that.      I cried afterwards - I put my face in my pillow and cried. He said next to me said "he loved me so much" and he said " you have no idea how much I like you. You really have no idea how much I like you". He was nicely touching my hair and back. I asked him not to touch me and please leave me alone.       I composed myself after 5 minutes and left his condo without saying a word.      Can I please get your thoughts????   I have never never ever been in this predictment. I have not told a living soul. I'm too ashamed & scared.       CAn you please write me back.       Jen   ******************************   March 4:   Since then this person has sent me voicemails saying he misses me.    Initially the first email said: "sorry things ended this way"   But the next day I got a love poem of him professing his love to me. Also on a dating site he messaged me saying he loves me and wants me to be his.      I ignored the phone messages. I did reply to his email love poem and simply said: "I'm not sure what to say".    His reply today "Don't say anything then".      Why is my arm also only begining to hurt a week later. What should I do about the arm?      Thanks,   Jen

Though I don't know the meaning of the word (name) Hitler, but I'm sure it can't be a bad something. But I'm surprised to see how average persons of the world are so mean or so superstitious!

We had a betrayer, called Mir Jafar Ali Khan, who being the sycophant of the then British rulers, betrayed the last Nawab of the Bengal, Nawab Siraj-Ud-Doula! But people still keep names of their children as either Jafar Ali or Jafar Khan etc. Is it a kind of meanness or a choice?

One night we kissed and began hooking up every weekend after that for the next six months. She's been in a serious relationship with a guy for about 3 1/2 years now. Eventually she stopped things with me because she felt guilty having feelings for me while she was in a relationship.

Now she's trying to tell me she didn't like hooking up with a girl...and I'm still hurt and still have feelings for her.      what are your thoughts?

My professor/advisor obviously noticed something was bothering me the past few times I've been to see her and asked me what was wrong but I didn't feel comfortable with it myself yet so I didn't say anything. I know she's my professor and it's not really her job to deal with this kind of personal stuff but I feel like she really does care or she wouldn't have asked. I also feel like I owe her some sort of explanation for my moodiness the past couple times I've met with her. I'm not looking for a therapist but I would feel better if she knew.

20090304141422AAFyyMu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist, is religion truly destructive or just another vehicle for destruction?	We have all seen religion destroy marriages, families, communities, and even nations.  Is it truly the effort of creating fellowship and a common moral fabric that is causing this destruction or is it simply that conformity of any kind is against our nature?  The search for higher morality regardless of what form it possesses has done some incredible good in this world.  So, is religion in and of it self evil or is it just that some people take it to extremes and forget that religion exists to help mankind not harm it?  Neither Theist nor Atheist seem to be bothered by Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny; both myths teach the importance of giving and cooperation, are perfectly benign and quite joyous for children and adults. :)

20090304111659AAJ01Ar	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why don’t more people find the Personal God notion frivolous?	It appears many believe in a Big Brother type of God that actually singles out specific humans in the entire Multiverse for the sole purpose of caring to and for them. (The lame quarrel for this being that God is infinite and omniscient and omnipotent—all of which are cop-outs because, I suspect, they really don't know what they believe).         Well, the Milky Way alone contains an estimated 400 billion stars. Do you know how long it would take to count to 400,000,000,000? It would take roughly 2,500 years. So out of all these stars and all these planets—which I’d say many are riddled with life just based on probability—this God singles out a few "special" people to look after just because they praise this anthropomorphic Personal God every week or so.      It's frivolous to believe such a thing!      And remember, that's just the Milky Way, which is one of hundreds of billions of known galaxies in this Universe alone; try thinking about the possibility of there being a Multiverse with an infinite amount of Universes.       Religion begins to look a little bit small-minded and childish after one meditates over that.

I met her in a bar once, then added her on bebo - sent comments to eachother (we get on great very similar) then I saw her at the pub last night again (karaoke night). As I was ordering drinks, I caught her looking at me then we both looked away then back and smiled, & as the night went on got talking/joking more. I actually started flirting with her complimenting her dress, touching her hair, looking her up and down...& somehow we got onto the conversation of guys & she said she thought i had a boyfriend...so i explained no and she said she didnt either. I asked her for her number...& as the night was ending she said that I should come back to another friends house she was staying at (she didnt ask the girl if i could)...but I said I couldn't as I was at another friends house...but that we should go out again soon....Tonight she messaged me to say she had a great night & she thinks I'm a good singer. I do feel confused because i'm not a lesbian but I'm thinking about her very sexually. I just dont know what to do incase she's not interested like that. I need to reply to her so I need to say something that shows her I'm interested without being obviously flirting? Help!

20090304143028AAZ0RMH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is gods lighting system a little inefficient?	The bible eloquently describes the vast majestic beauty of the seemingly limitless stars and galaxies that surround us with the line:      "He made the stars also."      He certainly made a lot of them. If you divided them up between every man, woman and child on earth we would have over one trillion each!      They're big too. Take our average little star, the Sun. 1.4 million kilometres across, it generates 383 billion billion megawatts of energy every second.      I'd hate to see gods energy bill.      Oh and lets not forget, they are far away. If we could travel at the speed of light it would take us 13 billion years to reach the most distant galaxies.      I don't want tell god how to do his job, but wouldn't it have been a good idea to make a few less stars, make them smaller and bring them a bit closer?            ...of cause there is always the small possibility that the universe doesn't really revolve around man-kinds ego?

20090304132514AAvaG5m	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What is an acceptable time to go to bed?	I always go to bed at 9.30pm.  I think this is a reasonable time to go to bed.  After all, who wants to be tired all day just because they stayed up until, say, 9.45 or even 10pm?  My friends all say that I should be going to bed much later as it's the "cool" thing to do and this makes me feel like a bit of a loser to be honest so sometimes I lie and say I stayed up later.  But this one time I got caught out because one of my friends asked me what had happened at the end of america's next top model (which i pretend i watch so that i sound cool) and i didn't know as i was really asleep.  So I guess my question is, is it ok to go to bed at 9.30pm?  and if not should i lie about it?

20090227074528AAeqcAv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Could my husband be gay?	I know it's tough to judge without actually knowing him, but I'm a bit worried.       It's been 3 yrs since we've been married.  We have a BEAUTIFUL daughter.  He's a man's man... works on cars, he worksout a lot at the gym.  He's not affeminate and not even a metrosexual.        Here's my worries.       #1 He's very anti gay.  He always talks so ugly about homosexuals.  He almost goes out of his way to talk about  how much he hates them.  One time, one of my cousins called him a f**got and my husband beat him senseless.       #2 I've allowed him to have a small porno collection, but none includes lesbian porn likes most guys have.  I have a feeling a lot of times he's fixated on the guy.      #3 he doesn't have the sexual appetite I do... I never thought I was a feign, but ever since we got married, I'm lucky if I get it once a month... and it's always in the dark.  However, I know he constantly pleasures himself.       #4 He recently has started to talk to a friend that I don't know... and he talks to him A LOT.  Sometimes he goes into the other room to talk to him.  I try to dismiss it as man talk... but sometimes I wonder.  He's getting his MBA, and claims he met him in class.  I'm not so sure.       # 5 We go windsurfing a lot... and a lot of guys walk around without their shirts.  He always makes comments like, "wow that guy's chest is amazing" or "his abs are awesome"... he's into fitness himself, so I try to dismiss it...      .... but I feel like I am now making excuses for him.  I don't want an ugly divorce but I don't want to be unhappy.  I have certain needs and not only that... I love him so much I'd rather see him happy pursuing an alternative lifestyle than being miserable married to me because he thinks he has to.      What do y'all think?
20090227074718AAM1Tb5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are atheists always making fun of Christians?	Every time I or other Christians ask questions Yahoo! Answers, at least one atheist will come along and mock them, their beliefs, or God. Whenever someone tries to call them on it, all they can say is, "It's an open forum." They accuse us of being pushy and ignorant when they are the same way themselves. Not every Christian is a pushy proseletyzer who will jam the Word down people's throats. Wouldn't it make sense that they would receive more respect if they were more mature and tolerant? Or is it for the best that they are this way so that people looking for truth do not fall in their trap? What do you think?

20090304123445AAQR5lR	Society & Culture;Holidays;Easter	Do you think I'm doing the wrong thing by not spending Easter or any future holidays with my inlaws?	I'm actually thinking that I want to cut of all contact with my mil (i love my fil, but he's part of her package) for atleast 2 years to get my head straight. I am the girl who wrote in a few weeks ago about all the anger i have towards my mil and how it affects my everyday functioning, because i can't seem to let go of my anger towards her. I received great advice from people telling me that i need to set strong boundaries when it comes to dealing with her and to be real with myself and what i can and can't handle. Since then, I have done alot of thinking about how I really haven't set boundaries, and I find myself doing things such as spending time with her during Holidays for my husband and kids, and putting their feelings before mine.  I have since decided that I am simply not going to see her anymore. I don't know if putting a time on it is right, but 2 years sounds great. I told my husband how i felt, and he said he understands, but he would like to see his family on Easter. We have a plan that he is going to take the kids to their house in the morning around 9:30 for their little easter breakfast and stay for an hour. When he gets there he's going to tell them, that I had a stomache virus and was throwing up and thats why I didn't come. When he gets home, we are going to continue our easter celebration and have my family over for dinner. Coming up with this plan with my husband has relieved so much tension that we usually have between us when deciding what we are doing for the holidays. I feel so much better about not having to deal with them and for coming up with a plan with my husband that pleases both of us. But for some reason, i just want to know what the public thinks of this idea?

So, if God decided to not exist anymore (which he would never do but I'm playing along with this hypothetical), then yes, we would be able to tell.      We would not feel this outside source anymore if he suddenly ceased to exist because it wouldn't be there anymore.      I can't explain it, but we would just know he wasn't there.      Do you agree?

20090304152310AAbnoh8	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	When do you consider it to be "Morning"?	Some people consider it to be morning as soon as Midnight, because that's when the date technically changes. But that makes its name "Mid-night" contradicting. Or like when people say, "1 in the morning", but can't say, "12 in the morning".      I like to consider it Morning when there's light out. But my friends can't comprehend it because it's not a "set moment".       I'm guessing this is more opinionated, but I'd like to see what other people have to say.

20090227080219AA2T9Jz	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	I need help in researching symbols the orbs are making in my pictures.?	I have been taking pictures of orbs for about two years now. Recently I started to talk to them and they started to form symbols. Some symbols are easy to describe. Some are not.      The main symbols are a line, a V shape, a teardrop shape and a circle with a dot in the middle. I will see an occasional S shape with a short line crossing the middle. I have also seen a lot of cross and X shapes. One symbol is 3/4 of a circle with a dot in the middle. Another variation is a horse shoe shape with a dot in the middle.      I'm not asking about what you think the orbs are, but would only like a direction to go in researching what they could possibly be trying to  communicate to me.       (I'm talking about the orbs that I can see with my own eyes. I can take pictures of them and videotape them.)       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeJC21lWX...         Here is the last orb video I did. It does not contain the symbols. I am working on another video with the symbols, but need to do the research on what they might mean so I can include that in the video.

Background:  I am a Christian and try my best to follow the instructions of the Lord.  IThat said, my family follows Torah Dietary instructions and now we are focusing on observing the Sabbath.

Is it okay:      1) To play Chess with my wife?   2) If Reading is apart of my job Mon - Friday, should I stay away from reading?   3) Can I play with my children?   4) When going to Sabbath Services, should we minimize out clothing so that we don't do too much to get dressed?   5) Is it okay to Rent a movie before the Sabbath and watch it on the day or is watching a movie or other entertainment prohibited?       ETC...      How do you balance observation of the Sabbath without getting into legalism?

20090304150411AA7IGCZ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do you ever think about the one who got away?	I was in a gas station/supermarket yesterday afternoon getting a pack of gum and some coffee when I awkwardly saw my ex-boyfriend there. I haven't seen him in a year and a half and we'd been broken up for two years, having dated for about four months way back when.      I was mortified because I always like to look good when running into exs but truth is I rolled out of bed that morning, hadn't shaved (I have a terrible 5 o' clock shadow) and I was wearing clothes I'd normally only wear around the house.      We avoided each other so no awkward conversation took place.      I'm currently engaged to a wonderful guy I have every intention of spending the rest of my life with (been together a year and a half, engaged a year now) but I haven't been able to stop thinking about my ex since yesterday.      I'll always have feelings for him, even though I would never ever consider being with him ever again, or even being friends with him for that matter. When I'm f*cked over, I never forget. I'm very untrusting and once you break my heart or my trust, it'll be a cold day in hell before I let you back in. That might sound cold, but I've let me guard down way too many times in the last five years with friends and exs.      I deeply love my fiance, but the fact that I think I'll always seem to have this level of emotional attachment to my ex is really bothering me. I live an hour away from him now so the odds of us ever seeing each other are slim to none, but still... I guess it just bothers me. At least when he's out of sight, he's out of mind, but it seems like everytime I happen to see him or have a dream about him, I think about him for a good week or two.      Do you ever think about the one who got away?

When you die, and IF you really see there is a god a heaven and a hell, would you regret what you believed when you were alive? - Now about that question, Im not pushing or saying to you THERE IS A GOD AND A HEAVEN AND A HELL WHEN YOU DIE, Im just saying what if that really did happen to you?

Or do you have to say that your athesist? Lol im so orry for this one, but I remember Dane Cook (funny guy) talking about how he was in a store and he said god bless you to an athesist man, and he said "Im an athesist."       Thanks so much for answering, but please dont take these offensively. Im just a curious 13 year old Catholic girl who doesnt understand others beliefs. So bye, and Im eager for your answers! :)

It looks like something derogatory.   Position: you put the back of your hand under your chin, then push a bit against it and thrust your palm towards the observer and look at him from above.   What does it mean?   An example to better understand the sign: at minute 0:58  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPDD19l_x... 
20090304151058AAv4pIf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How common is it that transgender issues be hereditary?	I cannot really find anything out about this. I know of a child who has had transgender issues for a few years- a young child. The father actually secretly cross-dresses and has only recently revealed that b/c he is now scared that he has "passed it on".   I've only read that it's not really heard of, therefore it hasn't been explored (the possibilities of it being hereditary)      So...if it isn't hereditary- how on earth did it happen like this???
20090304152706AAfanUg	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Dating... Should I have dinner at his apartment this soon?	I am currently dating a guy.      We met through mutual friends at a St-Valentines day dinner and hit it off; then we met alone to play pool; and one time, we had coffee. So we haven't gone on THAT many dates. Although we have kissed.      He was supposed to take me out to a nice restaurant this Saturday. It was a specific type of food he wanted to introduce me to, as well as a restaurant he worked at before (We are both university students, I am 20, he is 22).      Finally, we learnt today that the restaurant is closed for renovations.      So now he is saying that I should have dinner at his apartment instead and he will cook for me! Is this a good idea? Obviously it's not that I would have sex with him yet... but still, is it smart to go to his apartment this soon?      I have been to his place already, briefly, because we needed to pick something up on our way someplace, so I have seen it.      I'm just kind of surprised that he's suggesting we eat dinner at his apartment...      Please, let me know what you think!!

NOW MISSING WOMEN AND GIRLS,WHERE ARE THEY!!   Ahmedabad, Feb 28 (PTI) With the expiry of the seven years' stipulated time, authorities are set to declare 228 missing in the 2002 post-Godhra riots as dead. The move would take the death toll in the communal carnage to 1,180 from 952.      "We have prepared a list of missing people and sent it to the revenue department, which would declare the missing persons as dead," Additional Chief Secretary(Home) Balwant Singh told PTI. The State Revenue Department would send the details to the district collectorates for the subsequent process. Ahmedabad collector Harit Shukla said the final list of missing people from the police is awaited.      "Once we have the list, we will start the process of declaring them as dead, inform the civic authorities to prepare their death certificate and subsequently, compensation claims will be processed," he added. In the aftermath of large scale communal carnage, total 413 people had disappeared of which 185 people were found while 228 are missing.                http://in.news.yahoo.com/20/20090228/141...

Are there ANY atheists here that had a good relationship with their father? My bible teacher told me that most don't- statistically. Maybe you don't even notice it, but psychologically you reject even the idea of that kind of authority because your family past.

Neither attended church except on special occasions, both would indulge in an occasional drink, cuss just like the average person, both smoked cigarettes. Then one day my neighbors friend decided to start attending church on a regular basis, then he started attending church at least three times a week. No one was bothered by it. Then one day the friend of my neighbor decided they couldn't be friends anymore. They had an argument over invited guests at my neighbors birthday party. My neighbor didn't think it was serious enough to end a life long friendship but the friend decided that my neighbor was not a good christian and they should not be friends anymore.       that's the story in a nut shell.

My question is, do you think I should send in those reference letters anyway, since I have them? I'm thinking they might give me an extra edge for the job, and I'm thinking that if they didn't want letters they just don't have to read them. Or should I just give them waht they ask for, just the names and contact info? It is for a tour company that seems to have a really fun and relaxed environment. What does everyone think?

20090304145505AA4HDuI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Aren't some opposers of Christianity somewhat hypocritical?	Fundamentalist Christians are often criticized for not respecting others' beliefs, and pressing their own religion onto others. This is bad, obviously, and very wrong. We all know this.      But then, there are those who condemn Christianity, calling it a bunch of nonsense because many of the fundamentalist followers are ignorant, close-minded, and unaccepting. Many become fixated on this idea, "Christianity is bad."       Aren't these people being a bit hypocritical?   There are believers of Christ who are respectful of other religions; they mean no trouble or harm, they just want to believe in Christianity.      Why must they all hate each other for what they believe in? Why can't they all just believe what they want to believe, and accept that? Why must a Christian boy with strong beliefs, but respectful of others, still has to be ridiculed just because he believes in the Bible?

I need a website or book title that discusses the Romance languages in comparison to Latin.

20090304151550AAUfO5Y	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	When it comes to Israel Why do so many become angry & defensive at the littlest bit of negativity toward them?	As if they know that if they are exposed for the lying, murdering, cheating, and conniving state of people they are. They don't like it when you show the horrible things they do and the lying propaganda they use to cover their lies. THE TRUTH HURTS THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL THREATEN YOU WITH VIOLENCE.       http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/9501...       This was yet another missed opportunity to address the policies and decisions behind the grave violations of international humanitarian law , including war crimes, committed by Israeli forces," said Malcolm Smart, Director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program.       "The indiscriminate killings of many Lebanese civilians not involved in the hostilities and the deliberate and wanton destruction of civilian properties and infrastructure on a massive scale were given no more than token consideration by the commission," said Smart.       The press release explained that that though the Winograd inquiry committee was not vested with the powers of an official state commission of investigation, it had the power to subpoena witnesses and recommend the prosecution of officials it found to have been responsible for willful or negligent criminal conduct.       According to Amnesty International, "the [Winograd Commission] chose to limit its work to reviewing military strategy and political decisions...and made to effort to recommend measures for holding those responsible for [serious violations] to account. It recommends the development of mechanisms to ensure the effectiveness of fighting within the framework of international humanitarian law standards [and] immediate investigations by the army when there are concerns that international humanitarian law was violated and better preparedness for responding to humanitarian problems arising from military action."       "But it essentially brushed aside available evidence of serious violations of international law, claiming that interpretations of international humanitarian law are controversial, that it did not have the capacity to deal with the volume of data, that the alleged violations were already being investigated by other bodies, and that such allegations are used as propaganda against Israel, whereas it did scrutinize military strategies and the conduct of certain operations in detail, including in cases which were already being investigated separately."       Based on its on-the-ground research and analysis of the conduct of hostilities in 2006, Amnesty International concluded that the Lebanese civilian population paid the heaviest price for the Israel Defense Force attacks.       "Of some 1,190 people killed, the vast majority were civilians not involved in the hostilities, among them hundreds of children. The overwhelming majority of homes, properties and infrastructure targeted in air strikes and artillery attacks were likewise civilian."       "Although the Winograd Commission recommended that the army review its policies on the use of cluster bombs to ensure that the use of these weapons will not violate international humanitarian law and army discipline, it did not propose any concrete measures," said Smart.       Amnesty International called on Israel's government to provide data on the use of cluster bombs during the Second Lebanon War, establish an independent and impartial investigation into evidence indicating that IDF forces committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the conflict, and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.

20090304152108AAasXSv	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is MNU, mnuspreadslies.com, and district 9 real?	Ok. So I was just browsing the web a bit and came upon this website: www.mnuspreadslies.com. I was interested, having never heard of MNU and I was wondering what lies it was spreading so I went to the site. It talks about the rights of "non-humans". So I delved a bit deeper and it starts talking about aliens. So I go to MNU's website, to see if mnuspreadslies.com is a sham. Well MNU is what appears to be a legitimate website. If you look at the "careers" section, they are all jobs for interaction between humans and non-humans.      MNUspreadslies.com also talks about an area called "District 9" where a supposed space ship crashed in the desert. I've searched on Google, but the only things I can find are Wikipedia articles.      Does anyone know if this is real or if it's all just a hoax. It seems like a lot of trouble for a hoax, since there are non-human rights rallies and other such things. I would really like to know if anything about these websites is true.      The only thing I can find, besides the absurdity of it all that shows it's not real is on MNUspreadslies.com it shows a letter that MNU supposedly sent to "George" about his website. The letter says that he could be sued for slander and other such things. Slander is spoken untruths. George obviously doesn't TALK about MNU he simply blogs about it, which are written "untruths", which are considered libel not slander. It seems a huge company would know the difference.      Any help?

My friend's sister is going to Catholic school because she had social problems at the public school and couldn't get in to a better non-religious private school.  Anways, my friend tells me that her sister receives Communion when they go to church during school.  I know for a fact that she is not Catholic, and I am pretty sure that she doesn't believe it is the real body and blood of Jesus.  I think she should just go up with her arms crossed to receive a blessing.  She is Christian and I know that she does not believe in the Catholic faith.  What should I tell her?  I don't know her very well, but I think what she is doing is wrong.
